1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,383
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,440
Rogan experience day.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,500
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,850
Brian, I want you to apologize. All
the nice people out there in the world.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,300
I'm sorry I ever logged into the wrong
use dream account and I guess the sound

6
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:33,250
was too awesome. So the
sound was too hot. Yeah.

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,450
If I had to restart the computer and every
time I restart the computer it always

8
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,430
goes back to all the
defaults for some reason.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,000
So like the sound is really hot and uh,
my,

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,740
my like login is saved in
this, you stream. Thanks.

11
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,810
So automatically I just pay it,
you know, it screws everything up.

12
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:52,650
So every time I've restarted I have to
make sure everything is smoking weed

13
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,960
before it totally. We
have to, you know, we do,

14
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:59,460
we need a little yellow checky
checklist thing for you. Yeah.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,170
Can Channel you're on

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,840
the weed gets too much blame, you
know what I mean? He gets it, right?

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,010
No, it does. It does.
No, I mean like when I'm,

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,610
when I'm doing stuff like you get
stoned and you get, and everyone's like,

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,190
all right, let's start now. Let's start
now. And you're like, okay, you know,

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,190
and plan. I'm just fuck, when
do you Dan? I'm just trying to,

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm just trying to a backup lead.
You know what I mean?

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,880
He gets a bad rap speaking and we,
we got a,

23
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,050
Tommy Chong is going to come
on the podcast on Monday.
It's fucking awesome. Yeah.

24
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:28,670
That should be very fun. He a
apparently is using that. Uh,

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,690
Rick, you know that Rick Simpson thing,
have you heard that the cannabis oil,

26
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:36,040
there's some like some oil that
you can make with cannabis. Yup.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,950
It's supposed to be super, super healthy
for people who have a good friend.

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,080
A good friend of mine came to La.
He's, uh, he's from the east coast.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,910
He's got brain tumors in his head and
he's supposed to die in six months.

30
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,030
This was about a year ago and hardcore
10th planet is one of my top soldiers for

31
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:59,510
sure. He a man. It's,

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,780
it's weird because in the,
in the position that we're in,

33
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,840
we get a lot of people with,
you know,

34
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:08,930
there's a lot of people out there that
have cancer that her fans as well.

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,870
You know what I mean? And when
we're dealing with, you know,

36
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,830
this is not an uncommon thing to have a
student or someone come to me and have

37
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:17,840
cancer,
this happens all the time.

38
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:21,890
People are like dying and it's crazy the
spot that we're at. And we're like, fuck,

39
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,220
well there's a gigantic amount of
people in this country. You know,

40
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,110
you're gonna run into some people that
are sick and it's, it's, it's, um,

41
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,310
it's very humbling. Well,
this guy, he, you know,

42
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,540
he started that cannabis oil
therapy and his last checkup,

43
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,030
the tumors stop.
Not only did they stop growing,

44
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:45,980
did they shrank like 40% and his doctors
are like amazed at what's going on and

45
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:49,580
he's on this
cannabis oil therapy.

46
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,390
It's becoming really popular
now. You know, there's reports,

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,470
I don't even think it makes you
high, right? No, it doesn't. No,

48
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:00,130
it doesn't make any money at all.
So it's, it's not even an issue

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,150
of whether or not it's people are taking
this and getting, getting high on it.

50
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,290
The only way pockets your
highs if you heat it up.

51
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,640
I guess that's what's been explained
to me. Like you can't just eat it,

52
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,690
but when you eat it, if you just eat
like the leaves, it's really healthy.

53
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,800
They say like marijuana,

54
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,920
like the flowers and the leaves
are incredibly healthy for you.

55
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,230
Like really it's great thing to juice.

56
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,740
Like people should juice actual
marijuana more popular announced yet.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,540
So I have a friend who who's at this,
I dunno,

58
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,460
his tumors are shrinking,
which is crazy and doctors are baffled,

59
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,450
but he's been on that, that cannabis
therapy and it's working and it's,

60
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,990
and it's becoming more and more popular
and all these studies are coming up.

61
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,570
Well,

62
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,640
real legit scientific studies that have
shown that marijuana shrinks tumors.

63
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,000
It seems like every week or every other
week there's this new study that comes

64
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:56,410
out that proves that somehow marijuana
can cure some kind of cancer.

65
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,210
Here are some kind of
cancer there and it's,

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,760
it's becoming so popular that I
don't even retweet all of them.

67
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,840
There's just too many damn studies.
True. Am I going to ask my shit?

68
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:12,140
There's just too many fucking studies,
so I'm only re tweeting the juiciest he's,

69
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,380
it's crazy.
There's all this evidence,

70
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,670
all this proof that marijuana
is just wonder plan.

71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,130
It's not just an ordinary plan.
It's not just a plant.

72
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,320
It's like an Italian magical plant.

73
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,550
There's all this proof
and people still deny it.

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,360
It's still a schedule one drug and crazy
as that coke and heroin are scheduled

75
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:35,980
to cause they have medicinal use
supposedly. Yeah. That's crazy.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,750
Yeah,
it's completely ridiculous.

77
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,430
How about that video of that
one congressman grilling
that chick from the d and

78
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:46,620
check his mom. Really?
She deflected everything
beautifully. Oh my God. You know,

79
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,950
all illegal drugs are dangerous.
They're a bi woman.

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,350
All illegal drugs are bad.

81
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,570
You know the DA's watching like in a
dark room, laughing their asses off gone.

82
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,000
That was brilliant.
You know,

83
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,900
she got like a fucking $500,000
bonus and shit for that. Really?

84
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,750
I thought she was terrible.
She looked brilliant. Well,

85
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,860
nothing's going to happen from it.

86
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,270
They just needed someone to go out there
and Jibber Jabber and just get past it

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,810
and whatever and then they don't
give a fuck. They got an old lady,

88
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,150
they got an old lady. So it's easy
for a guy. If you don't think that,

89
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,640
think too deeply about it.
You're like,

90
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,180
here's how could I be against an old
lady who's trying to keep us off drugs?

91
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,420
You know what I mean?
An old lady trying to keep us off drugs.

92
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,090
So a lot of people with the
shooting. How old was she? She,

93
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,440
she looks like 36 or 40 she's like
60 [inaudible]. Yeah, she was all,

94
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:38,500
they got an old lady up there and see
all I got out of that, that was that.

95
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,420
She was joyless.
I didn't get her age.

96
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,110
I got just as joyless woman perf
out there working. Brilliant.

97
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,470
Just the best old lady come
out and just say whatever.

98
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:51,250
They're like laughing in the back room
cause you don't really, they don't really,

99
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,980
they're not really accountable and
nothing really is going to do that. Yeah.

100
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,970
Do you think like they don't
know all the truth and shit.

101
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,980
They know what they're trying

102
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,720
to suppress it.
So how do you suppress it?

103
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:03,350
Fuck where they want to grill someone
in the DA. I'm not going. You Go. No,

104
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,630
I'm not going in any fucking
make the secretary go out there.

105
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,710
I'm sort of million dollars.
Just say, just say drugs are bad.

106
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,310
Just see trucks are bad and it worked
because it's on video and it's not going

107
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:18,260
to change shit. And it was like,
you know, she tried to um, you know,

108
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,980
different addictive properties.
All drugs are bad,

109
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,880
drugs are illegal. Is Marijuana
more addictive than heroin? Um,

110
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,930
I don't, uh, they're both illegal and
both of what is more, more addictive,

111
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,400
marijuana or heroin,

112
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:39,020
which in your opinion is more addictive
but both have addictive properties.

113
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:42,380
Both are illegal and you
choose a or B. Yes, exactly.

114
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,830
But it's like jeopardy on Saturday
and you are an expert on this.

115
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:46,820
You should know this.

116
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,440
Is Marijuana more dangerous then
pills and prescription pills.

117
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,060
All drugs are illegal. All
drug. She was brilliant.

118
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,460
It was perfect.
It's so weird.

119
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:02,120
It's so represents like if it was a
movie and this was like the frustrating

120
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,340
point in the movie where people were
starting to get all the information and

121
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,260
started to realize that
this, the structure that
they've got set up, it just,

122
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,420
you don't have to live this way.

123
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,780
We just lived this way because it's
been set up for us before we had any

124
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:18,900
information on how things are really
going on behind the scenes and then you,

125
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:20,810
you see something like this,
I mean this is,

126
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,110
this is the thing that would make people
rise up if that was really the drug

127
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,120
enforcement agency that
was really their attitude.

128
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,450
That's really their take on it.
That's really a spokesperson for this.

129
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,180
Like what are you doing?
Yeah, watch that video.

130
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:36,410
It's congressman grills d a
agent or something. So hilarious.

131
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,750
It's talking about like
fucking prescription pills.

132
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,420
They're talking about abusive
prescription pills, but you know what?

133
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:45,080
They're not talking about stopping those
prescription pills were being made.

134
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,370
Someone's always going to get them,

135
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,820
so it's always going to have a backend
because someone's always going to happen.

136
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,240
You can't stop. You can't
stop prescription pills.
And make prescription pills.

137
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,920
You can't do both, you know, so you never
going to stop them. That's horse shit.

138
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,340
So when they say that they're,
they're,

139
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,980
they're looking to cut down on illegal
prescription drugs. Like what ever,

140
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,610
what, what, uh, what kind of a
fucking smoke screen is that?

141
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,650
How much money is that even? How much
money is it compared to the legal ones,

142
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,650
the people who are legally
selling the exact same shit,

143
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,310
but because the doctor says it's cool
to take oxycontin every day for the rest

144
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:23,390
of your fucking life. You're down
in there. Next thing you know, Whoa,

145
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:27,470
you're a junkie. That's
legal though. That's illegal.

146
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,420
But marijuana, you can't grow. You
can't eat this incredible plant.

147
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,440
Even if you were completely uninterested
in getting high, if you just said,

148
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:39,380
the nutrition of this
plant is unquestionable.

149
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,310
If you look at the amino acid profile,
if you look at all the nutrients in it,

150
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,510
look at the fibrin. It's an incredible
super food. It's better than Kale.

151
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:50,870
It's like, but it's so expensive. You
could never eat it because it's illegal.

152
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,900
But if it was legal,
it'd be cheaper than fucking Kale.

153
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,010
That would be a real problem.
I know a bunch

154
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,010
of people that lived in
northern California that
prosper off of the illegality

155
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,990
of it that were arguing,
they were going to vote against it.

156
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,920
If it came on the ballot. They're like,
we make more money. If it's illegal.

157
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,890
They were,
they were ready to go gangster.

158
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,550
They would rather go gangster and then
make it a little bit of extra money then

159
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:19,510
have it like that's like contrary to the
whole idea behind weed in the first put

160
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,690
money takes precedent. Yeah. It's amazing.

161
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,090
It's amazing how strong the pole is in,

162
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:29,850
in some circumstances over like what
would be good for humanity. You know,

163
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,110
man, fuck it. I go to the TV
are going to pay for, you know,

164
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:38,670
could you imagine that some assholes grow
and he's like organizing people to try

165
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:42,780
to stop the, the, uh, initiatives to make
it legal. Fuck. Keep it illegal, dude.

166
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,040
Keep it illegal. Just you and me and bro
worked together. I'll get you the weed.

167
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,600
You give me the cash. Selfish
bitches. So can imagine.

168
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,660
So how self hating would you have to be
to be a pothead who grows weed and you

169
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:01,590
vote against it being legal
fucking piece of shit.

170
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,830
You fucking dummy.
That's some silly bitches.

171
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,670
Don't say Spiderman. The,
I won't see Spiderman.

172
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,710
We talked about this earlier before we,
uh, were brought to the wrong channel.

173
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,150
Tobey Maguire is a way better. Spiderman's
funny. Yeah, the new one's not,

174
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,610
it seems cold.
You can't keep rebooting shit man.

175
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,450
So I think they should repeat it one
more time and then just get that last one

176
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,070
and just make it Toby back and make it
not explain to me what the coolest part

177
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:33,160
was. It's like they use slow motion
a lot, kind of like matrix stuff.

178
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,530
They used it a couple of times
and it was really beautiful.

179
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:38,470
So I think they should slow
down the movie, make it slow.

180
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,480
But Tobey Maguire doing jokes, dude, I
thought I told him McGuire was awesome.

181
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,790
Batman. I thought it was perfect.
Spiderman, Spiderman, Batman.

182
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,610
He, he like was a perfect Peter
Parker. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect.

183
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,640
It's exactly what I imagined when I
was reading a comic book where this guy

184
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:58,110
seems like, um, twilight,
Spiderman and I got emotions,

185
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,590
I get bruised and scratched
you bitch.

186
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,470
And then there was some really cool scenes
where they tried to do like, like a,

187
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:09,620
like if you were the person like you
know, like a spoiler in right now. Not,

188
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,970
not at all. I'm not giving away any plot.
This is like more effects and stuff,

189
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,160
but there's probably like
first person shooter style,

190
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,260
like where they just failed at it.
Like it's like,

191
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,690
you know how like in a video game where
that you will see the arms calm and got,

192
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,940
it was a three D it was three d imax
and it was just like these little hands

193
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:27,520
going like here in the corner or
something. I'm like, no, it's not,

194
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:31,900
you're not doing it right like it. So you
want it like a full arm slowed it down.

195
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:35,410
Like, like if you were first person
move while he's swinging, you know,

196
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,370
made it look super cool. I
think that would be way better
than then. I don't know.

197
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:44,080
It just Spiderman by the way is way
more bad ass and an actual spider.

198
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,040
If a spider,
it was the size of Spiderman,

199
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,340
he wouldn't be able to
fucking shoot webs that far.

200
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,500
And they hold themselves explaining
the technology this time I behind it.

201
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,300
I don't know if I like
that. And uh, also they uh,

202
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,660
they redid the whole uncle Ben things.
Do you the whole time you're like,

203
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,570
you don't have care cause you know
what's going to happen to him.

204
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,420
He saw how it was going to
happen in the previous thing.

205
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,000
It's like before it used to
be in a comic book, you know,

206
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,510
it wasn't translated in person. In
a movie, you get to see it again.

207
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,300
I had to see it kind of again and
they changed it a little. Yeah.

208
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,030
That is kind of wag right down in a movie.

209
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:22,840
Like Mary Jane wasn't around and it
kind of freaked me out, but she would,

210
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,050
oh Mary Jane at all. No, Mary
Jane bugged the hell out of me,

211
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:29,950
sons of bitches and I don't
know, man. It was, it was fun,

212
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,490
but it kind of bummed me out.
It just didn't feel like Spiderman at all.

213
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:37,450
There was no humor in the whole thing
and Spiderman is a comic book was was

214
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,380
humorous and your Bravo,

215
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,150
bravo hates like superhero movies.

216
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,570
The only superhero I like is flash.
There's a kick ass.

217
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,190
There was never a big flash movie was
there. I'll go see that. That's it.

218
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:55,540
Other than that, did you see kick ass?
I like that. Yeah. That's kind of cool.

219
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,040
You just don't like like stupid shit
like Captain America flying around and

220
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,750
shield and stuff.

221
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,930
I know most people like that shit
obviously cause they fucking come out with

222
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:08,020
three of them every year.
I know most people like that shit.

223
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,640
I'm in that small minority that I
wish I fucking like. I wish there was,

224
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,490
I wish every time a fucking new
Batman came out I got [inaudible]

225
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,910
do fucking anything. That's
crazy. That'd be bad man.

226
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,140
It looks fucking shit myself crazy.

227
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,670
I was not a DC guy when I was
growing up was a marvel guy.

228
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,980
There's something about that.

229
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,940
I feel like I'm still prejudice against
Batman or something because I don't

230
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:38,200
really care about it as much as
like the Avengers is fucking pumped,

231
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:42,370
man salmon and that that movie delivered.
Did you like the Avengers?

232
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,740
How dare you Eddie Bravo.

233
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,180
How everybody liked it do just
for the hulk alone. It's awesome.

234
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:52,480
The Hawk is amazing. Greatest Song
of all time. They'd nailed it.

235
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,300
It's like days used to do the
whole kit. It was like, you know,

236
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,970
first he did Lou Ferrigno. He did
a great job for a person. I mean,

237
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,120
if you're going to get a person to play
the hook, that's the perfect got right.

238
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:04,570
Giant fucking knew, but he was never
anything like the hulk in the comic books.

239
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,860
The hulk in the comic books was not a man.
It was just fucking freak.

240
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:13,420
This crazy big freak thing that it's
so fun to watch when he gets mad.

241
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,190
When the hulk gets mad,
you think about God damn,

242
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:19,960
could you manage if you could do with
that guy he do. He can fight anything.

243
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,860
The hulk is unafraid of
anything. He smashes everything
in front of. He smashes.

244
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,350
He smashes gods.
He grabbed a god and smashed him.

245
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,520
Just smashed them all over the grounds.
The fucking rubbles breaking up.

246
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,260
You have to like smashing Eddie. When you
watch it, it's still give it a chance.

247
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,110
I'll give a, the hulk alone is
so fun. I'll give it a chance.

248
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,890
He fucking goes after a jet,
like a Jenny shooting missiles,

249
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,390
Adam and he gets fucking mad. Goes
after the jet. I mean it's to be,

250
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,370
the hulk would have to be like if
you had to, if there was like one

251
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,540
thing you could do,
if you could like,

252
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,690
if they could give you like some
sort of a neural implant, you know,

253
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,740
what does the movie total recall type
experience where they simulate a reality

254
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:05,240
for you and you get a chance to try it.
Like what would you like to do?

255
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,530
I would like it'd be the hulk.

256
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,100
Can it be the hulk in an artificial
reality for just one hour?

257
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,740
You know how fucking bad ass
that would be. You can fly,

258
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:16,790
you can jump and fly through the air.
Bullets bounce right off you like nothing.

259
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,180
You could smash. I would want to be
seeing a pissed off mood all the time,

260
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,660
but you would only be fighting
bad guys miraculously. The Hug.

261
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,820
Never heard any good guys.
Direct answers. Spiderwoman now

262
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,600
you have the same power as Spiderman,
but she's a woman.

263
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,790
She's got boobs and a vagina.
So for one hour you get to be Spiderwoman.

264
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,470
Plus you can play with your boot
boots and vagina for an hour.

265
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,281
That's the best way.

266
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:41,810
And it's going to be a woman you'd
rather smashed in and do that. Fuck yeah.

267
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,730
Fuck yeah, because a lot of spiders,
when you fuck the, the female,

268
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:50,990
the female kills the mail.
That shit happens all the
time and we kill some dudes.

269
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:55,610
Fingers open, swing around New York, some
bs apparently when the orgasm die too.

270
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,930
Did you know that really? Some
fucking beast. Certain beans,

271
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,480
like when they orgasming or
take explodes and they die,

272
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,670
the nature has a way of making
sure there's not an overflow.

273
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,930
Making sure that,
you know,

274
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:13,250
we've got to even out this population
thing and the female spider does not trust

275
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:16,680
that male motherfucker. So after he
impregnates her, she's like, yeah,

276
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,380
I'm done with you. And she did Jackson,
which is really kind of fucked up,

277
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,790
but probably a good idea.
I mean,

278
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,030
if she loves her babies and
she's going to have babies,

279
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,190
you're going to trust all 1000
of her babies with this canteen,

280
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:33,980
male spider around. He might just eat the
babies if he's fucking hungry, you know?

281
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:37,730
She's like, I can't take that chance. I
just got to jack him socially Jackson,

282
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,500
I guess I was wrong about Spiderman.

283
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,760
I guess the amazing Spiderman
was a different storyline
then I guess one of the

284
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:48,740
other spider. So the comment at the
amazing Spiderman, the only main one,

285
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,800
like the w rights where like Peter
Parker and the amazing Spiderman or, oh,

286
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:52,390
I don't know.

287
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,000
I mean nerdy to me the fuck
out like a web of Spiderman.

288
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,420
I don't even know. So now I'm really
confused. So sorry, nerds. I fucked up.

289
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,600
I fucked up. I remember Mary
Jane Doe Being Fault though.

290
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,570
They can't be changing plots like this.
Amazing Spiderman was Mary Jane.

291
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:11,780
I think up a new superhero bitch.
All right. You have to keep changing.

292
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,080
Don't change Spiderman. Right? Fuck.
He probably doesn't give a shit.

293
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,030
He would get mad. We would
go to movies like, well,

294
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:20,720
I know this guy's going to live.
He always would get upset.

295
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:25,550
You can never just enjoy it. It was like,
this is so stupid. They're mad ass, man.

296
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,420
I,
there's some,

297
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,750
there's something about movies that I
could figure out if I could figure it out.

298
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I hate it if it has me on my toes and
it's totally unpredictable and as a really

299
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:40,010
good storyline obviously. But that's what
I'm into. I like, I like not knowing,

300
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,640
that's what gets me excited, knowing
what's going to happen. You know,

301
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,380
all that money that I'll, that CGI
it takes for you up for Batman to be,

302
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,070
he's like in seven fights per

303
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,450
movie, seven big episodes where
he almost dies, right? He's a,

304
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,080
he's fighting all the shit, all that work
that's so expensive. And so, granted,

305
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:02,220
it looks so beautiful
and for me, um, minority,

306
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,990
that doesn't mean anything for me.

307
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,430
It doesn't do shit and grow up block plane
watching cartoons much studio or like

308
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,000
any of that stuff. I wasn't in the
comments because I watch cartoons.

309
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,000
I watched the Super Heroes, I guess
the super friends and I was like eight,

310
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,880
you know.
But did you like star wars growing up?

311
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,010
And I did like star wars growing up. Did
you enjoy Avatar? I like to have a time.

312
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,930
Okay. But that was a super
predictable movie, man. That
was a complete comic book.

313
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,890
Movie Avatar was the ultimate,
um,

314
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,730
like pre determined, like
predetermined, ending moving. No,

315
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:39,030
a superhero movie is the most that's
like, you know, Spiderman is gonna live,

316
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:41,460
you know, it's going to be the
Avatar dude was going to live.

317
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,540
He lived through the whole thing.

318
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,630
He became a fucking one of the
member of the noble people himself.

319
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,610
Avatar wasn't as predictable as
Spiderman come on. No Way. Oh Dude.

320
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:54,660
It's by no means the most predictable
movie. Batman or Superman,

321
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:58,080
all that shits the same thing. But this
movie is predictable too because the guy,

322
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,140
I mean w w not even predictable
because I don't think that,

323
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,640
I shouldn't even say predictable.

324
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,290
What I should say is it follows
like a pretty obvious pattern.

325
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,590
It follows a pattern with a purpose
person that you're focusing on in the

326
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:15,370
beginning is probably going to be alive
at the end. Like 99.999% of the time. Yes,

327
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,100
but it's not as clear as a superhero
movie that's called Spiderman. You know,

328
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,220
Avatar wasn't a person of
Avatar was like a chick.

329
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,010
You knew that or up dude
or something like Avatar,

330
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,090
the fighter and he's going to follow it.
I see what you're saying.

331
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,010
It's because it's a science fiction movie.
You don't consider it a comic.

332
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,210
It's Vince. I worship Tara. I'm not
trying to watch it back on. It's good.

333
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:39,930
I know what you're saying. It is. It's,
it's less ridiculous than a Batman.

334
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,830
There's different levels.
When I say it's a comic book movie,

335
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,200
I say that with a compliment
because I loved that movie.

336
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:49,770
I thought most people do know. Most
people love that shit. You know? I just,

337
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,490
I just can't feel it. But you felt
avatar and I'm saying that Avatar,

338
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,670
he is very much like,
in a lot of ways it's like a comic book.

339
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,920
It's not like a superhero movie.
That's what I meant.

340
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,750
I meant like a superhero comic
hero. Like, like my name is Avatar.

341
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm going to save this alien planet.
Did you watch that shit?

342
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,380
Did you enjoy like Clint Eastwood movies?
Like those half humor movies,

343
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,860
like every which way,
but loose now really told them

344
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,780
tool around. I don't
know. Do you remember him?

345
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,500
He eight.
I barely remember.

346
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,180
I did see Bj and the bear and Bj and
the bear. I mean, I was into that shit.

347
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,240
Isn't it weird now that we
know so much about chimpanzees,

348
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:34,580
like something that kid that's student
in Africa just got his fucking testicle

349
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,990
ripped off,
his fingers bitten off.

350
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,650
They dragged them for like two kilometers
or something like that. I mean,

351
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:44,010
he's really scary shit and they beat the
fuck out of this kid now that you know

352
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:48,190
so much about chimps is really a
hard to watch. Like Bj and the bear.

353
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,760
And this dude's like tooling around with
a chimp. It's not even really a chip.

354
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,190
It's a baby.
It's a little baby chimp.

355
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,210
It's like a little three year
old or something like that. Like,

356
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,260
cause that's about as old as you can
get before you got to circle out that Bj

357
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,660
and bringing in a new Bj or bringing a
new bear or whatever the fuck his name is.

358
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,570
You can't have that. He can't
grow up. Cause if he grows up,

359
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,860
he's going to fucking drive.
You know?

360
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Imagine sitting in the cab of a truck
with a giant male chimpanzee and he's

361
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:19,240
like, how about I just fucking drive
right now? Just grabs that wheel from you.

362
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,103
What are you going to do?

363
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,620
It's going to bite your fucking nose
off. Brian, some due to work at a zoo,

364
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:29,000
brought home a baby chimp because her
mom has the baby, the chimps mother died.

365
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,070
And at that same time she had the person
that worked at the zoo have this dog

366
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:37,340
that just had puppies, had four
puppies, like this big massive.

367
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,950
And she brought that fucking chimp home.

368
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,880
And that massive took in that
champion as a child of its own. Oh,

369
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:47,210
I got all these pictures of it. It's
incredible. They're like all hanging out.

370
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,470
It's like a little baby chimp.
Holy Shit. You know what I'll do?

371
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,700
I'll tweet it to you. You'd be able to
see it there? Yeah, I could tweet it.

372
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,280
Would you rather be she hawk?
What's that like?

373
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,960
She Hawker halt for an hour. She hulk or
Hawk for an hour. Is there a she hulk?

374
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,940
Yeah, it does. That's a strong,

375
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,930
maybe not his check dude. Why do you keep
trying to turn yourself into a check?

376
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,840
Because I mean if you could have
a vagina for an hour, just don't.

377
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:15,140
You'd rather be the lingering stores.
The Gorney weaver.

378
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,830
Did you look the Harris so you really
get seriously, are you serious?

379
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:21,400
You really want at the time and one hour,

380
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,030
it could be for one hour to be Spiderman
or spider woman where she hawker,

381
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:29,720
she earned made a fire and so you could
feel what it feels like to get clocks

382
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:35,620
go, didn't know what it feels. A robot
from the towns. You're curious about that.

383
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,180
It doesn't have to be a fantasy
to just use your battles,

384
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,200
have boobs and hold one
hour besides no period.

385
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,460
No period. This is fresh, fresh as
big come for one hour, one hour dude,

386
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:51,230
you would get bored.
You would want to start using it.

387
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:53,060
You'll be out on the street going,
who wants a fuck?

388
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:56,240
I've got 40 minutes left as a woman.
Yeah. But if you're super woman,

389
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,380
imagine flying around like on top of
like the earth and just go and look how

390
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:04,250
beautiful it is and then start fingering
your pussy and sucking on your own

391
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:07,630
tissue. Maybe it was weird. Why did you're
doing, maybe it will stain your, your

392
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,450
brain and then when you come
back to being a man again,

393
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:14,050
it's imprinted in your memory
now you'd just become gay. Maybe.

394
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Was there a story about a dude who got
in some sort of an accident and then

395
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,630
became gay? It was like, uh, yeah.

396
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,570
I think like rugby player cause he's
looked at the pictures of him before.

397
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:25,990
He was like sucking dicks and stuff like
that. I mean he just had like really?

398
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:30,490
He looked gay. So you think it was just a
good excuse? Yeah, like you realize, hey,

399
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:33,480
life is short. Maybe. Why don't I
just say that I just got knocked gay.

400
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,260
I don't know.
Oh yeah.

401
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,510
I just think if you're going to do it
for an hour and you can get to fly around

402
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:44,320
and look at nature. When I
told finger yourself, okay,
well I could see your logic.

403
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,010
You've really wouldn't do it for

404
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,010
an hour. No, I'm not really into
being a chick at all for an hour.

405
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,110
What if it starts to try?

406
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,890
You will never be convinced that you
can fuck what you're saying right now.

407
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,790
Shit, that's deep shit.
What you're saying,

408
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,010
this is millions of people or one hour.

409
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,820
You have to deny that Shit Brian,

410
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,140
to do this is like a mood from the
eighth to buy it. Deny it. Say that.

411
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,670
You're just trying to be funny
right now. No, I think say the hour.

412
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,150
It would be kind of fun. You're curious
to see how it would be to get rail.

413
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,540
You could make that happen.
You don't have to it,

414
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,120
you could actually make that happen.
I'm just saying man, like most drugs,

415
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:20,954
I'll try it once.

416
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,150
Wow.

417
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,640
But not facts or anything like
that except for a woman. No,

418
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,030
no, no, no. I'm saying if I could
be spider woman or spider man,

419
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,520
might as well be spider one me. Cause you
have boobs and a vagina. I'm not saying,

420
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,510
I'm not saying it like, Hey, I want to
have a sex change. I know to thinking,

421
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:39,310
well why not?
If you're going to go all out,

422
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,980
if I was 12 and I lived in the eighties
I probably would agree with you. Right?

423
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,920
I'm going to say no. I
feel creepy. Listen man,

424
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,830
it's still saying,
even contemplated the thought.

425
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:58,210
I mean it's a funny thing for men,

426
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:02,080
but even contemplated the thought of
what it would be like to have, you know,

427
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:04,270
to switch places and to be a woman,
you know,

428
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,760
just what would it be
like if you were born?

429
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:09,320
I will never thought it ever and
I've never wanted to be a woman to,

430
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,090
but if I had to choose between
spider woman and spider man,

431
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:16,840
I think I might go with this. You're
saying, I understand what you're saying,

432
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:20,110
but I'm saying it's a funny thing that
people get really uncomfortable about the

433
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:23,830
idea of even pretending
that you're a woman,

434
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,510
like or allowing yourself to even think
what would life be like as a woman like

435
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:32,080
matter? Like what are you doing? What
are you doing over there? You know,

436
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:36,520
like it's a, it's a legitimate thought.
I mean there's only two sexes. Okay.

437
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:40,570
One's male, one's female. If you
happen to be male and heterosexual,

438
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:44,470
how much do you understand about what
it's like to be a female heterosexual?

439
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:47,860
Do you really understand it? No. You'll
know you're standing your side of it.

440
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,720
What would you, uh, you know, there was
like a little thing, like a little chip,

441
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:57,490
like total recall style and you can be a
woman having sex and you can experience

442
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:59,650
what it feels like to be a
woman having sex with a man.

443
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,020
Would you do it or
would that make him gay?

444
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,380
I'd be super woman would flight
the Eiffel Tower and just going,

445
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,130
what would be some shit the girls
would find out and they'd be like,

446
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:11,550
really creeped out about you. You're
like, wait a minute, wait a minute,

447
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:12,580
wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

448
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:15,340
You did at all the things you
could do with total recall.

449
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,550
You went and you were a woman
getting fucked by a guy.

450
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,370
Is that what you're telling
me? Well, I'm just, you know,

451
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,760
it's not a gay thing at all. I just
wanted to understand the experience.

452
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:25,660
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

453
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,870
You could have done anything and all
that money and you decided to be a girl

454
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:35,350
getting fucked by a guy. Well, you know,

455
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:38,950
I mean I don't think of it that way.
I think of it as like, you know,

456
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:42,850
experiencing something new. Otherwise
it'd be like completely out of my reach.

457
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,380
It like there's a joke coming. You know
what I mean? It does. It sounds like that.

458
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,410
It's like one a year,
early,

459
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:53,220
two thousands you're talking to some
chick on the phone. Wait a minute.

460
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,500
You mean to tell me girls
would not be happy with that?

461
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,620
I wouldn't be happy if I was a chick
and I found out a dude pretended to be a

462
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:02,760
girl and got fucked by cock and be like,
Whoa, how much that stays in your head,

463
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,620
how much that stays in your head,

464
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:08,430
how much is the pleasure of caulk that
you enjoyed so much as a woman for that,

465
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,610
you know, whatever amount of time. How
much of that is in your memories still?

466
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,730
Did you love the cock during that time?
Okay,

467
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,850
well cause then you still love the cock.
They could turn the gay fuck around.

468
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,430
I'm just saying, we're not saying
you're getting fucking happened.

469
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,330
I'm talking in comic book in the future.
That's probably what game's all about.

470
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:27,630
It's just some new evolutionary
exchange so that we can, uh,

471
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,300
have like less people.
What I think is gay or,

472
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,770
and this has been happening a lot on the
ice house, chronicles his other comics.

473
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,110
I think it's happened twice now saying
if they were in a steam room and a Brad

474
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,350
Pitt or George Clooney walked in,
would they totally fuck them?

475
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,480
And I think Burt Chrysler said yes.

476
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,250
Bert Kreischer said he would fuck
there was somebody else. I can't cry.

477
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,840
She was just being funny. No,
but they were all being serious.

478
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,040
I don't know if it was
Bert Kreischer at night.

479
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,440
Somebody tweet me if they can remind me.

480
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,470
You're saying you don't know if
it's him. That's a serious, it was,

481
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,100
I think it was rob Lowe was correct.
It's a serious allegation.

482
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,720
You better know that name is correct.
But that's been happening.

483
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,160
That's been happening a lot lately. And
I'm like, why would you want to do it?

484
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:11,580
He's like, dude, I think same AAA,
maybe awesome. But it was like, dude,

485
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,460
it's fucking Brad Pitt.
But yeah, but you know,

486
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,010
you know that this is all just for humor.

487
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,380
You can't pretend these are real
conversations. You're average.

488
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,100
That's what I said. You're just kidding.
And they're like, we're done. Stand up.

489
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:27,600
Comedians don't, they're going for the
joke. Yeah. Okay. So whether or not, Bro,

490
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,800
I don't know whether or not Bert would
actually look. Burt, my, that Tom Cruise,

491
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,890
fuck him. Just for the story. If he,

492
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Tom Cruise had a moderate
to small size dick and uh,

493
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,170
and he wore a condom and
Burton didn't have to kiss him,

494
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,940
Burt might do it just for the story
because where does the greatest stories in

495
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:49,380
the history of the world and you don't,

496
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:53,730
you don't have those stories without
taking some chances. I don't know.

497
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,790
But he might be willing to do it just
for the store. Most likely I'd say no,

498
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,450
just fuck. Is that going to get an and
Harrison Burg crisis? The fucking man,

499
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,480
it's the funniest guy of all time.

500
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,530
He's right up there with Joey d
as far as like, like ridiculous,

501
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,150
natural humor. He just so, just
such a silly guy. He's so fun.

502
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,380
You know, it's such a great
guy to have around, you know,

503
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,190
so that the last podcast, it was
all fun. Cruising can fuck him.

504
00:29:22,191 --> 00:29:24,990
Probably just getting the last part
of the house was all fucked up.

505
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:29,280
It's in two parts. You know, we had the
Josh Barnett one you're talking about.

506
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,750
Yeah, we had, it's like a power thing
where I got electrocuted and shit. Yeah.

507
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:37,860
We have the ice house unfortunately had
a little issue with their electrical

508
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,920
system that led to Brian
getting electrocuted in his
fucking face. Yeah. And so,

509
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:42,520
uh,

510
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,790
so that night I had took a,
after you left,

511
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:48,940
after that podcast I took
apart the whole entire studio.

512
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,820
Courtney came over and we like went
through and throw away all this stuff.

513
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,660
I went through every wire to make sure
it wasn't on my side and I put it back

514
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,390
together and we had another podcast,
the bone zone.

515
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,850
And right before the podcast started,
uh,

516
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,290
some somebody put in between the alley
of the studio and the other building,

517
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,800
I think it was somebody who said it was
like an m 100 or something like that,

518
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:12,080
which is like a quarter stick of dynamite.
And uh,

519
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,050
it's a firework but it went lit it, but
it's super illegal and lit it. This,

520
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,500
I dunno,
like super loud.

521
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,940
I was inside like plugging the outlet
in after hooking up all the thing.

522
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:28,570
And I put it in and I like stood up and
it happened and I thought it was that,

523
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,610
you know, cause I'm so I
just got electrocuted and so,

524
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,290
but I filled out all my face, my
face like when like, like lobby,

525
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,740
like the impact and someone
threw a bomb at you pretty much,

526
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,960
but they were doing it in
between cause like, uh,

527
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,720
cause there was a comedy show coming
and coming out and some, you know,

528
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,510
do just threw it on the ground or
something like that. But where did it go?

529
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,840
Did it go inside the room? No, no,
no, no. Outside the room. Right by.

530
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:51,640
Right outside the room in that alley.

531
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:56,000
So it was in a conf confined
place cause to alley.

532
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,250
There's that space. Yeah.
And it was, yeah, man.

533
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,200
Fireworks or a fucking ridiculous. In
California. It's so God damn dry. I know.

534
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,240
People are shooting shit
up in the air all day.

535
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,060
See what the fuck is going on
in Colorado, man, you know,

536
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:12,580
there's this huge wildfire.
They think part of it was started,

537
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,090
one of the rumors that some kids were
shooting at things right there were

538
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,490
fucking around with guns and they
hit a rock or something like that.

539
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:22,270
It causes a spark and that was it.
That's all she wrote. So I shit myself,

540
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,790
we all ran outside smoke everywhere.
People freaking out.

541
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,880
I thought the building was blowing up.
Like I thought that the electric thing,

542
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,990
you know, and all those like, like
something is not right. Uh, and you know,

543
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,990
freaked out. Anyways, we did the
podcast. All this shit happened, uh,

544
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,920
after the podcast,

545
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,210
I'm driving home a good to the stoplight
and I was about to go to the gas

546
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,530
station, but I was like,
no, I'm going to stay.

547
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,680
And it's black dude starts walking up
to me holding two car stereos and like

548
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,760
something else,
some other box,

549
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,050
like a camera camcorder box or something
like that. He got and he stops.

550
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,640
He starts screaming at me and I turn up,
my stereo was a little bit, and then I,

551
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:01,210
I tried to roll up my window,
but my window, it's fucked up.

552
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,830
Like it's like some setting where I hit
it and it will like roll up halfway and

553
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:07,330
then roll all the way down.
I'm like,

554
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,390
it's been a hit it again and it rolls
up like only a little bit and then it

555
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,490
rolls down. I'm like, fuck,
I'm just going to keep it down.

556
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,770
The Guy starts screaming and I'm just
kind of ignoring them and finally unlike

557
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,150
in the corner of my eye,
I'm like, all right,

558
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:22,360
this dude's still staring at me and
screaming at me, so I better look at them.

559
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,880
So look at him. He goes, give me a fucking
cigarette. And I'm like, oh, all right.

560
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,990
He goes and he goes and he goes through
it on the mother fucking crowd. I'm like,

561
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,600
what? He goes, I'll go, I'll
go to jail for you. I've got
gun bitch. And I'm like, oh,

562
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,070
okay. At through the cigarette on the
ground. And he picks it up and he'd

563
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,550
just like stares at me for like a minute
and people were honking their horns

564
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:46,400
around because everyone else is seeing
what's going on and he fucking starts

565
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:49,340
acting like he's going to walk to me.
Like walk towards my window.

566
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:53,640
I'm the dude look fucking psycho.
Like he looked crazy and then, uh,

567
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,340
I just like the light turned green over
like when I like took off turbos style

568
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,630
in my car, but it was fucked up.
That whole day was fucked up.

569
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:05,030
That haunted house day.
Yeah. That was a weird day.

570
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,080
Josh Barnett was on the way up here
from Orange County, got a blow out,

571
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,830
barely controlled his car. He said it
was trying to go into the dividing wall.

572
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:15,740
You gotta hold it together,
pull over to the side of the road.

573
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:18,560
He got to get told it changes tired.
Then he got to the podcast.

574
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:22,140
By the time he got there, Brian had
been electrocuted in the face. Yeah.

575
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,580
That's sucked. I did you hear
it? Did you listen to her?

576
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,910
I saw this almost like see like a little,
there's a white park. Yeah. I was like,

577
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,750
didn't really see that. They're really
see that you saw it cause it was like,

578
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,600
yeah, that's um, that's not good.
Electrical Shit is fucking freaky.

579
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:45,170
Scary as fuck. UHMM electrical
fires, that kind of stuff too.

580
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,160
We gotta be real careful when
you get in sparks like that.

581
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,280
Who knows what the fuck
that's going to hit. You know,

582
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:52,460
weird chicken happened
when you got the storm.

583
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:56,260
Just hit through Ohio and like most
of Columbus doesn't have power race,

584
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
a lot of the whole east coast. Yeah. Yeah.

585
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,540
My Dad said that he won't have power
till next Wednesday. Jesus Christ.

586
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:07,400
So he has a generator just to do his
refrigerator and his TV and fans.

587
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,850
That's scary shit man. It's
like you have a generator. No,

588
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:12,050
I need to get one on shit.

589
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,590
It's scary to find out how easy it
is for the power of wow. You know,

590
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,740
it's scary number. When they were, there
was some sort of scandal in the, in,

591
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:23,540
in California and they were doing these
brownouts whether it would just shut

592
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:28,340
people's power off for a little while.
I don't remember what the scandal was.

593
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,860
It was, I don't remember
what, but there had been,

594
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:34,610
they had been shown that there was some
collusion involved in shutting people's

595
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:38,390
power off. I don't know the exact story.
I'm totally butchering it. But uh,

596
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,930
I remember thinking that like that was a
scary thing man, when that was going on,

597
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:46,840
when they would just shut the power off
in certain spots, you know, that's not,

598
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,310
wait a minute, you guys can't keep
the fucking power on all the time.

599
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,680
What are we doing that's really fucking
scary. Yeah, it is scary. It gets scary.

600
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:56,330
Like how much power do we have? We use
it all up like what's going on here?

601
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,150
That wizard last night is the second
time where I've been like, all right,

602
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:03,860
this is getting really dangerous out here.
You can, you never know man. When you,

603
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:05,810
when you drive,
you never know.

604
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,110
It could zig when you should've zagged
and all of sudden there's a crazy dude in

605
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:09,680
front of you.

606
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,540
You know when Justin Martin Dale
fucking window fixed and Justin Martin,

607
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,380
Martin Dale got recently
robbed and stuff like that.

608
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,590
Like a lot of people have been talking
about it and a lot of bartenders in

609
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:22,280
Hollywood have been getting robbed
because they have money at the end of the

610
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,420
night and they're leaving.
So people are,

611
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,590
these two guys are like targeting these
guys and I guess from a friend of a

612
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:29,840
friend,
what they're saying is that it's a really,

613
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,520
there's a really bad problem right now
with people getting mugged and La and

614
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:36,960
Hollywood, but they're not saying
anything because they don't want it to,

615
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,220
you know about a lot

616
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,680
of attention drawn to it. Right. But
like it's really bad. A lot of people,

617
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,330
well a lot of people are getting fucked.
The economy's in the toilet man.

618
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,290
More of a reason to do Jujitsu I guess.
Gun You,

619
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,830
yeah. You know what? I'm going to kill.
You want to get in a gunfight? No,

620
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,050
just we knew we need to figure
out what the fuck the problem is.

621
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,700
Our society is just,

622
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,710
it's so funny how little we do like in
terms of or literary require in terms of

623
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:06,360
government and,

624
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,220
and as far as like engineering our
future as far as like, you know,

625
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:15,270
figuring out a way to cut crime back.
Looking at all the methods, superheroes,

626
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,523
looking at no,

627
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,950
talking about looking at different
methods to rehabilitate people.

628
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,960
It took a little bit of Ibogaine
or Iowasca or you know, any,

629
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,040
any fucking,

630
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,490
anything that you could do that could
help like rehabilitate kids once they get

631
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:33,030
into trouble, once you realize that
they're headed down a bad alley, you know,

632
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:37,500
then we do like nothing for that. It
was, you know, very little consideration.

633
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,010
It's not like something that's
on the Internet every day.

634
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,900
They're talking about all these kids
that are growing up and shitty homes and

635
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,530
what we need to do is figure out a way
to provide some sort of guidance for a

636
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:47,940
kid that doesn't get it from home.

637
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,230
Some sort of a way to take advantage
of all these young kids and give them

638
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:54,470
something that no, no.
Like isn't that what,

639
00:36:54,471 --> 00:36:56,670
like it should not be a part
of what like the government is.

640
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,860
It doesn't that make sense?
I mean if you,

641
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:01,440
if the you needed them for anything
wouldn't need like they would,

642
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,570
let's say we need to look at the future
of our youth. This is a, this is the plan.

643
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,300
We need to figure out a way to stop all
the fucking people from dropping out of

644
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:13,230
school need to figure out a way to pay
for more schools and that kind of shit

645
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,940
when you wouldn't that be the, the answer
and some, some way. In a perfect world,

646
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,500
what's wrong with this world?

647
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,590
This world worlds could be perfect
if everybody got their shit together.

648
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,730
If the world was filled with cool
motherfuckers. It is a perfect world.

649
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,170
We are the world we,
ah, the trilogy in it's,

650
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,360
it's totally possible for anyone to get
their shit together up to a reasonable

651
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:36,990
point.
I feel like a serial killer.

652
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,390
You probably shouldn't be fucking
hanging around even if you're sorry.

653
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,460
But you know what I mean?
For most folks,

654
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,380
it's very possible for anybody and at
some point in the life to have some sort

655
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:50,350
of an experience that puts them on some
sort of a path to eventually getting

656
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,430
your shit together. I don't,
I don't count anybody out.

657
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:58,180
I think it's almost possible for
everybody except extreme idiots that are

658
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:01,860
probably just here to dig holes. I think
there's gotta be a few of those too,

659
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,250
but other than that, right? Yes.

660
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,190
I'm so fucking fake, Chris.
I agree with you. Yes.

661
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,870
I'm so glad Tom.
All down.

662
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,940
I'm all down for positivity
and prosperity, all that shit.

663
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,943
Yeah.

664
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,400
I just think we have to figure out a way
to make people nicer in the best way is

665
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:29,700
all the shit they're trying to
keep us from. The best way is weed.

666
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,830
You see this long beach raid, they fucking
stepped in this kids neck as a kid.

667
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:38,710
Did nothing wrong. Complied completely.
They said, get on your knees,

668
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,940
lift your hands up. I stepped on his
back and then stepped on his neck.

669
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,440
Big fucking cop. Big, big guy, man.
It was just a clumsy stylic. Yeah.

670
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,250
I don't give a shit like he doesn't give
a fuck about him. Like I own you bitch.

671
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:51,370
She stepped on him like a carpet.

672
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,920
But the problem is they didn't know that
they were being filmed and there was a

673
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,660
camera up there and the camera
apparently records at a remote location.

674
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,960
It doesn't even record there.
So you can't like get the video.

675
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,290
So the cops couldn't do anything.
They smashed the cameras,

676
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,140
but they couldn't do anything
to get rid of the video.

677
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,780
Do this fucking video of them smashing
the cat. Well, it's the, first of all,

678
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:18,100
cops have no business smashing security
cameras. You have no business doing that.

679
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,470
You're supposed to abide
by the fucking law.

680
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,470
Just because you're a cop does
mean because you enjoyed that,

681
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,060
that episode of shield. When a, that
fucking, what does that was the,

682
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:29,350
the shield was that dude's
name Michael Chiklis.

683
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,320
Michael Chiklis would rough
people up and kick them.

684
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:35,530
Step on their head that this is real life.
You fucking cunt.

685
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,150
You're being paid by these people.
These people pay taxes. Fuckhead yeah,

686
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,430
watch the video. It's on, I think
harbor each rage on Youtube.

687
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:43,990
I think that's what it
is. Look, they, you know,

688
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:47,020
20 years ago they would've beat the
fucking kid to death with a bat and said

689
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:50,650
that he came out and we won a knife.
You know, if it was a, it was a bad cop.

690
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:55,390
I think bad cops today are under much
more scrutiny than bad cops in the past.

691
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,261
You know,
if you look,

692
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,110
look at like Serpico and shit like that
and look at those outputs, you know,

693
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:02,980
movies and you know, hear about the
stories of corruption in that movie.

694
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:05,710
Cocaine cowboys where the
whole Miami Police Department,

695
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,980
half of the half of one year of the
graduating class of the police academy,

696
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,950
half of them were murdered and the
other half of them went to jail for

697
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:19,780
corruption. Like they were all
gangsters. They were breeding gangsters.

698
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,550
I don't think that's possible today.

699
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,880
I think there's cops there are way
better than they've ever been before,

700
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:29,080
but a lot of them are under
a lot of stress and they
develop a fucking us versus

701
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:31,180
them mentality and they do shit like that.

702
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,580
Or they just step on some kids and
neck and they just did. It could,

703
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:35,740
they could and that's a county thing,
man.

704
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,110
You can't just do
something because you can,

705
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,410
you can't just step on some kid's
neck who's not doing anything wrong.

706
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,520
It's Kaizen young kid to the kid looks
like he's like 2021 years old, right?

707
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,880
It doesn't look, it looks like a
really young kid going after that guy.

708
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,830
Someone going after the cop should man,

709
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,280
this kid didn't do anything wrong.

710
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:57,750
He did everything they asked of them and
you know, it was, it was creeping is uh,

711
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,300
you know, I don't want to bring race into
it, but he's a black kid and they're,

712
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:04,270
you know, they're stepping on his back
and stepping on his neck and it's,

713
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,670
you know,
I don't know what the race of the cop was.

714
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:09,550
He looked like he was a white cop. I
don't, I don't know what the fuck he was,

715
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,880
but either way, man, that's
fucking completely uncalled for.

716
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,510
If that kid had been out there throwing
rocks at cars in the street, fuck yes.

717
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:21,610
Step on his neck. If that kid had
been out there robbing old ladies or,

718
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,530
or beating people up or, you know what?
Yeah, fuck yeah. Step on his neck, man.

719
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,570
Kick him in the fucking
head once you have him down.

720
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,020
But he didn't do anything and honestly,
you should just comply with the law.

721
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:34,010
You had him down on the ground.
Just handcuff him. Yeah. But

722
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,380
I'm saying if none other dangerous person,
you have to,

723
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,140
you have to do something to
immobilize them. You know,

724
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:43,460
if you've got them lying down on the
ground, man, I would for sure soccer,

725
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:46,850
kick him in the head if it was legal or
if you got to like a really dangerous

726
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:51,800
guy. Like if you, if you have like
some Ted Bundy type dude and you know,

727
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:56,030
and you, you're in a situation with him,
you know, we're, you know, he's, uh,

728
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,380
he's resisting arrest.
You're not gonna,

729
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,290
you're not gonna kick him in the head
while he's on his way down sticking his,

730
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,890
but like,
wouldn't you want to kill him

731
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,270
punching as hard as I can to the shoulder
punching in the shoulder? What's legal?

732
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,940
But do you think it is the guy,
if the guy makes a move on you,

733
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,340
are you allowed to hit him? Like how
does it, how does that work for a cop?

734
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:17,620
Cause cops have to be careful about that,
right? Yeah, for sure. There's, there,

735
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,930
they're always on edge because for sure,
most people don't like to be arrested.

736
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,210
And then you never know when someone's
gonna fucking freak out and punch you in

737
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:24,650
the face and try to get
away with something.

738
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,140
So for sure they have to
be on edge all the time,

739
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,600
but when they take it out
on someone who does nothing,

740
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,010
I can't take your side anymore
because now you fucked up and he's,

741
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,570
I'm on your side. When you're
dealing with the cons of the world,

742
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:37,850
I'm on your side.
But when you do that to a kid,

743
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,510
because he works in a place where
they sell plants that make you happy,

744
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,250
well then you're a cut. That's just the
way it is. This poor cop became a cunt.

745
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:50,060
He became a cut by doing his job, probably
didn't even realize he was a cunt.

746
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,590
He realizes that he's a cut now.

747
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,110
Now that video got out and
people realize like what a,

748
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,780
what a fucking shitty thing
that is to do to a young kid.

749
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,860
It's becoming real good business to ray
dispensaries and just rob them. Yeah,

750
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,863
they take their money,

751
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,610
they take the money now it
becomes more profitable for them,

752
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,940
for more states to legalize
it. You know? As medicine,

753
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:16,170
they're just going to raid and
fucking pillage. Yeah. Well, I,

754
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:20,300
I, you know, I hope there's some way to
stop that. I really do. It's a disgrace.

755
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,540
And it's just one of those things where
people are doing something just because

756
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,710
they're allowed to do something.

757
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,650
If you look at the allocation
of resources and how,

758
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,580
how much crime exists in our
world, you would say, well,

759
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:35,250
let's concentrate on the things that are
really hurting people. You know, his,

760
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:39,050
his marijuana really hurting people.
No, it's not. Well, you know,

761
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,590
what's really hurting people, murders,
you know, what's really hurting people,

762
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,050
drunk drivers, you know,
it's really hurting people.

763
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:49,580
People that are trying to harm people.
Uh, people that do assault and rapes,

764
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,450
people that are there.
It should be that.

765
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,130
That's the stuff that we should be
protecting people from. Number one,

766
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,720
when we get that under wraps,

767
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,640
then once you start looking at
some other stuff like, you know,

768
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,310
personal use stuff like alcohol, tobacco,
marijuana, everything, all the above.

769
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,520
I think we shouldn't examine them
all equally. But that's that. What's,

770
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:11,690
what's unfair about our society is that
these people that are supposed to be in

771
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,850
control supposed to be our leaders,

772
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:18,851
our first sure under a financial umbrella
of one aspect of the community that

773
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:25,970
trying to keep these natural drugs
illegal. The pharmaceutical companies,

774
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,810
they would,

775
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,810
they would go lose an incredible amount
of money if you took all the illegal

776
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,710
shit like Ibogaine and marijuana,
if that,

777
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:37,790
all that stuff started getting researched
and all that stuff started getting

778
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,950
laws passed and and government,
you know,

779
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:44,910
foundations where they set up Ibogaine
research centers where people go in to

780
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,830
relieve themselves of addictions.

781
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:50,400
If that shit started to happen and man
pharmaceutical drug companies would lose

782
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,140
a fuck load of money.

783
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm not saying they want people to be
addicted to like oxies and shit like that,

784
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:01,740
but people are in kicked in and
then that money's coming in. Man,

785
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,130
that might come in and,
and it's not a little money,

786
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,650
it's rivers and rivers of money.

787
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,750
The pharmaceutical industry is so big,
even if they have the best intentions,

788
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,350
the amount of money is so staggering.

789
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,900
It just gets out there and then it
finds a way to get out their salesmen.

790
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,540
Even it's not the fucking companies idea.

791
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,460
They just need to take the
weight off their shoulders,

792
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,520
leave it to the pharmaceutical
representatives and the pharmaceutical

793
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:27,181
representatives.

794
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:31,440
They take nurses out to dinner and doctors
out to dinner and they fund like golf

795
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:35,370
trips and shit and they're like,
come and support us stuff and then like,

796
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,610
like street hustlers, you know, and then
they connected to the people. Then boom,

797
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:44,400
people just get pop pills every
way you look. It's amazing.

798
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,160
It's amazing that we, we, we, we see it.

799
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,850
It's all written right down right
there and yet the government doesn't do

800
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:51,540
anything about it.

801
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,710
If they don't investigate that instead
they go after medical marijuana

802
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,660
dispensaries.
That's ridiculous.

803
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:01,710
If you look at the things that are doing
harm in this world that you would spend

804
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,880
any time whatsoever, it's just
like, why are you doing that?

805
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,580
You haven't done your homework yet.
You haven't finished your job.

806
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:09,840
We haven't done the right thing.

807
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:12,300
Why are you concentrating on
these extracurricular things?

808
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,590
Because they're written down and they're
easy. It's written down that it's legal.

809
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,450
It's even though the community
would completely disagree,

810
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:19,920
if you look at allocation of resources,

811
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,100
I guarantee you the community would
completely disagree that forget about all

812
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,260
the murderers. Let's, let's,

813
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,550
let's get a team of people together that
aren't doing any other real police work

814
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:31,860
that day and make them do
something that's a boring,

815
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,420
make them rob a bunch of fucking people
that are selling marijuana state.

816
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:40,950
Legally sad. It's sad. It's sad that
the cops have to resort to that.

817
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,980
It's sad. It's weird seeing
the undercover cop in the,

818
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:47,630
in the video because he didn't like they,
he was dressed up like all teenagers.

819
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,060
The whole thing is creepy.
Completely sad is fuck.

820
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,090
I feel sad for the cops that
have to do that. I really do.

821
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,830
I think most cops do not want to
do bullshit, stupid fucking pot.

822
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,730
Dispensary bus, especially this one.
This one's so small. If you look at it,

823
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:04,690
it looks like it's just a tiny operation,

824
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,920
but they just destroyed it and
stepped on people. It's fucking gross.

825
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:11,400
You know the, the cop, I blame the
leadership man. I blame the leadership.

826
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:13,560
I think you know,
most of these street cops,

827
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:16,290
they do what they have to do because
they get, they get told what to do.

828
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,830
All right. I think that we had
a look at what we're doing, man.

829
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:22,860
You can't keep arresting people for
no fucking reason just because they're

830
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:27,540
selling weed. It's stupid. It's just
stupid. Let them pay taxes. God Damn,

831
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:30,580
and there's money to be made here
or treat them at least like humans.

832
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,030
At least you know the,
the,

833
00:47:32,031 --> 00:47:35,980
the whole idea of like going after them
and rating them and taking the money.

834
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,220
It's so gross. It's disgusting.
It's like, what do you,

835
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:43,210
what are you preventing you preventing
any crime other than the stupid fucking

836
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:46,750
written thing that says somewhere that
you're not supposed to enjoy certain

837
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:50,200
experiences because the government
has deemed them out of your reach.

838
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,830
The government that hasn't even had
these experiences. That's, that's this,

839
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,680
this disgusting. Goddammit
Eddie Bravo. Yeah, man.

840
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,520
It's disgusting, right? Yes. Checked out.

841
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:06,430
You know the people at the high levels,
they know the truth.

842
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:08,560
They know how beautiful
and magical the plan is.

843
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,200
You think that's what real artists,
they do?

844
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,530
The people that they actually experienced
it. You don't think the pharmacists, uh,

845
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,980
business doesn't know that you
think they don't have any idea?

846
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,780
Of course they know you're
going to stomp it out.

847
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,640
If you work for a pharmaceutical business,

848
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:25,240
you just get pharmaceuticals
like a motherfucker like
every day or at the office

849
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:28,600
just trading pills back and forth
to each other. Oh, you know what?

850
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:29,530
I will say this man.

851
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:34,531
I fucked up my back the other day
and Jujitsu and I took a Vicodin.

852
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,870
I took a Vicodin and two percosets
and my back was still fucked up.

853
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,000
That shit fucks with your boner. First
time ever I went limp during sex. Wow.

854
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,480
I can I get a perk it? Yeah.
It was on two, two percosets,

855
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,080
maybe three and Vicodin and that
night I tried to have sex. My deck.

856
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:54,500
It sounds like your body
is probably doesn't work
poisoned at first time I went,

857
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:57,450
he's limping a long time.
Anyhow. That's a lot of shit man.

858
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,220
You supposed to mix them like that.
My back's fucked right now.

859
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:02,710
It's still fucked up. What party?
Your back. Your lower back.

860
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:04,150
Lower back and froze on me,
man.

861
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,430
I slept on the floor last night
and trying to try to work it out.

862
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,780
Apparently if you sleep on the floor,

863
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,300
I don't know if that's a myth that if
you sleep on the floor it's supposed to

864
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:13,960
like it's good for your past. She'd get
in isolation and that'll help a little.

865
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,170
It doesn't seem like it would be.

866
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,490
It seems like your back would be
ruined and sleeping on the floor,

867
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,750
but you get a massage or
anything. No, I haven't.

868
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,870
I haven't had time to use a pillow.
Go and need one.

869
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:26,980
I can go to a deep tissue person. Someone
who's going to fuck your shit up time.

870
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,580
Yeah, that's good too. But you might
be like in pain for a time massage.

871
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,240
They I want to bend you up and shit.

872
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,390
Yesterday I'm on no pain pills today.
Yesterday I was on the pain pills.

873
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,270
I'm a no pain pills today,
but, and it still hurts,

874
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,720
but at least I don't have
to take vicodins. Wow, man.

875
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,520
I never take shit when I get injured.

876
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:49,180
I hurt my back pretty
bad like four months ago.

877
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,160
It was a real annoying thing for a while.

878
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:55,270
I'm glad that I can just deal with it
because if I had gotten on something,

879
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:56,860
if I had taken some sort of pain pills,

880
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,090
I'd be taking it for a few months and I
who I could have gotten addicted easily,

881
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,030
you know? I don't know. I don't know what
the physiological effects of that are,

882
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:09,090
but I was in some pretty good pain most
of the time for like a whole month and a

883
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,070
half and a 98% of the time I have sex,
I'm high and that is a fucking my butter.

884
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,340
No, it does. It better. It makes, it
doesn't make you more compassionate.

885
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,920
It makes you more like sensual Bra.
Makes the organism actually see.

886
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,160
I'm weird about it. I even, I like, I
like weed, but I think alcohol, I love

887
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,680
fucking one.
I'm on alcohol [inaudible] ambition thing,

888
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,700
but a lot of people don't like the really
alcohol, you know, people can get it,

889
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,740
you know, whiskey Dick, you
know, or something like that.

890
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:39,050
If you get really fucked up,
you can get whiskey deck,

891
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:42,650
but you'd have to drink a lot. Yeah, I
would not. I would have to be not alive.

892
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,120
Yeah, of course. You're limited.

893
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,760
You have a glass of wine I've gotten
with correct before. For sure.

894
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,830
Real fuck. Yeah, for sure. I think I've
ever been done that too. If you fuck,

895
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,430
you start the problem when you start
drinking his alcohol reduces inhibitions,

896
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:58,791
right?

897
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:03,740
It removes your inhibitions and it
removes your inhibitions more with every

898
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:08,240
drink. So you know, if you're, if you're
a little, you know, a little tipsy,

899
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:12,290
you got like a little bit of
inhibitions. Throw up on a check. No.

900
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,320
Right.
As I was about to eat her pussy

901
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,350
hot chick, I was 19. I was like,

902
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,330
we were drinking greyhounds.
I'll never forget it was the gray house.

903
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:30,280
We just pound Greyhound
is, uh, I think it's Gen.

904
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,640
Uh, it's a plan. It's a grey hound.
It's, it's light green, light yellow.

905
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,800
I'm not sure what the alcohol,
a bunch of blueberries,

906
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,240
it's grapefruit juice and
vodka or something like that.
I think it's great food,

907
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:44,630
juice and vodka. Anyways, it was a
greyhound. Whatever the fuck it is.

908
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:47,420
I'm not a bartender.
So mad.

909
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:50,900
I couldn't believe I was getting
this piece sash. Super Hot,

910
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,690
open up the legs and right.
All I remember is

911
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,570
I threw up, grabbed me, she grabbed me,

912
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,690
they dragged me down the hallway and I
just remember scenes of going through the

913
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:03,320
hallway,

914
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,850
throwing up down the hallway and they're
trying to get me to the toilet and I

915
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:11,270
finally get to the toilet. I have
a couple more, uh, JAKKS left.

916
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,380
Never fucked her. I never saw her
again. Never saw that when I was,

917
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,680
there's no way you can
come back from that.

918
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:22,310
You can fuck up the throw up into her.
When I was young and I

919
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,030
use a lube on her ass when
I was prime carrot in there.

920
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,360
What's, take the carrot
out. Fuck in the ass.

921
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,880
Enzymes are retarded.
I think you burn yourself.

922
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,700
It probably burned it down. It's
this whole, sir, what do you have?

923
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,790
Bio Burns on your Dick.
Whatever. Whatever.

924
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,380
Fucking nothing. Come
on. Who loves it man?

925
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,990
Nobody ain't throw it up on your Dick.
Tried to fuck your

926
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,860
blow up. You threw up in her and then
just said it's all slippery down there.

927
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,490
Let me just start good
like Goolarri and shit.

928
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,130
Maybe I fell asleep balls going
down on my girlfriend once.

929
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,620
At least once. I used to have my
paper route. That's quite common,

930
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,100
but I didn't fall asleep cause I was tired
cause I fucking threw papers all day.

931
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,520
I got tired.
I'd be like drunk and I partied all night.

932
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:23,830
You just get home and pull down your
pants. You just fall asleep or something.

933
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,370
She goes to the bathroom and you're
just waiting. Then you're done.

934
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,970
She comes back and you're snoring.
[inaudible] paper boys. Yeah, I was.

935
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,330
How creepy is that now looking back,
they don't have, it wasn't always.

936
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,830
That was a paper man. I had a
car. I only delivered with a car.

937
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:42,150
I was in the six or seventh grade and I
remember waking up at 5:00 AM my parents

938
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:45,290
weren't even awake and I would like go
outside and find these newspapers and

939
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,630
like have to put them in the
bags. You know what, man,

940
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,800
it's weird now because the fact
that you were out there, you know,

941
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:56,510
on supervised and we know how creepy
people are, how creepy adults are,

942
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,750
but it's good for a kid to get
some sort of responsibility,

943
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:05,751
something that they don't
want to necessarily do but
they do and learn how to

944
00:54:06,091 --> 00:54:10,020
like just fucking some shit in your
life is going to need to just get done.

945
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,290
You got to need to do that. You
know? And there's, there's a,

946
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,760
there's a good benefit to teach
you the kid that early, you know?

947
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:18,810
And that's what's great about a paper
route, a paper route. I was like,

948
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,080
I remember kids that I knew that
had paper routes when I was young.

949
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,220
They would like more organized than
the other kids. They're like more like,

950
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,540
like Jimmy's got a fucking
landscape business, right?

951
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:32,190
He's 13 fucking landscape business.
Like this kid,

952
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,260
he started out with a
paper route and then he,

953
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:38,880
I mean when the key was like fucking
delivering newspapers on a bike every

954
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,790
morning before school.
Like that guy's a ambitious is fuck.

955
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,060
Like he would get up like an hour and a
half before everybody else had to get up

956
00:54:45,061 --> 00:54:46,950
for school and he would
go down with his bike,

957
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,910
get as newspapers and then fucking
drive around on his bike and deliver

958
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:55,230
newspapers. That motherfucker had some
sticktuitiveness. You know what I mean?

959
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,290
I had a friend did the same thing. One
of my good friends growing up. Yeah.

960
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,380
You think you are and
you learn how to like,

961
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,470
you learn how to work hard when you're
a kid like that, but that's not good.

962
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,190
I think. Uh, I was never good at
waking up early. It's torture.

963
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,300
It's not why I sleep is awesome. God
Damn. I'm enjoying my life right now.

964
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,920
It's one of the things monkeys like to
do. Sit back and fucking chill. Oh Man.

965
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:18,690
Can I just relax a little longer?
Yeah.

966
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,900
Apparently when you get older you
don't want to sleep in anymore.

967
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,150
You just wake up.
Is that true?

968
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,530
I've been waking up earlier because you
always hear like old people waking up at

969
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:33,090
six or five people weird. Who knows?
Everybody's got their own clock.

970
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,970
My clock is,
I'm up like,

971
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,800
it's been my clock since I was a comedian
or you, uh, or time to get you right.

972
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,680
Noonish noon. It, she'd
go that deep. Yeah.

973
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,800
I like to go noonish up really,
really early. I'm up late,

974
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:54,180
but you're always up later than me. I
usually like five. Yeah. The my best.

975
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,860
My best shit gets done.

976
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,900
My best work gets done at night when
I know everybody else is asleep from,

977
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,870
for whatever reason. I want to
know my whole neighborhoods asleep.

978
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,060
I want to know there's nothing,
there's no sound.

979
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:08,160
It's just like Mike Tyson shit
right there. I don't know what,

980
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,020
I don't know what it is.

981
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:13,850
Didn't he get up like at three because
no one else was working out. Yeah.

982
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,860
We'll get up at three o'clock in the
morning because I knew my opponent's

983
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:21,540
wouldn't be doing that.
That's really good, man.

984
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,110
Mike Tyson is one of the,
he's an easy one.

985
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,900
Easy one. Yeah. Tyson and Arnold
and uh, those are like the staples.

986
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:33,430
Yeah. For a while, when we were younger,
it was captain Kirk and Jack Nicholson.

987
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,500
Remember everybody would do
a Jack Nicholson impression.
Yeah. It's a weird thing,

988
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:40,570
dude. You can miss the funniest
of oppression right now.

989
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,500
I don't know who's like the funniest
impressionist? Who's like the,

990
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:49,790
that your favorite guy. That's Michael
Winslow. A seamless, sandy does.

991
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,860
He's still around.
He's,

992
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,750
he's the guy that makes insane noises
with his mouth. He still does voice,

993
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,420
just like whammy pedals and shit.
Like his show is ridiculous.

994
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:02,980
Like you can't believe that it's actually
coming out of his mouth. He did. Um, um,

995
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,750
uh, what is not purple
haze? Fuck. What is the, uh,

996
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,240
I forget what the fucking Stan
Voodoo child he did Voodoo child.

997
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:14,560
The beginning with his mouth.

998
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,140
You should actually pull it up cause
it's kind of fucking incredible.

999
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,570
Michael Winslow. Michael.
Yeah. We played this like,

1000
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,800
did we play at like 10 episodes
ago? Yeah. I don't remember playing.

1001
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:26,650
I tell you to shut. The only way I know.
No, I didn't. You told me about it.

1002
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,740
Did I really? Yeah, sure. Yeah, we played
in, I forgot, but I want to see it again.

1003
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:31,870
Can we see it again please? Cause I, um,

1004
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,170
I forgot how, I think it was
a long time ago, dude. Now,

1005
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:41,140
cause I remember it was
about maybe 20 episodes,

1006
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:43,690
but there's something cool about
watching someone imitate. Oh,

1007
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:47,150
you know who was a fucking awesome
impressionist dice clay. Yeah.

1008
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,930
Dice clay has like the best
John Travolta. Amazing. Ciao.

1009
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,370
Ciao. Freddie Lockhart. Jeff Richards
is really good. It's really good. Yeah.

1010
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:00,190
Freddie Lockhart's amazing. Freddie
Freddy Lockhart. It's Morgan Freeman.

1011
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:04,450
That's probably one of the
best impressions I've ever
heard is as dead on as you

1012
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:06,730
can get. Like if he called
you up, you know, and said,

1013
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:09,490
I'd like to put you in a movie,
you'd be like, whoa. Shit.

1014
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,800
Being a movie with Morgan Freeman.

1015
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:21,260
This is crazy, man. This is going to
freak you out of the original artists.

1016
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,380
Can you eat? Yeah. Alright.
Alright. Have you heard this?

1017
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,790
This is a dude with a good heart
and then Michael Winslow, his mouth.

1018
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:32,900
Oh, it's whole lot of
love. That's what it is.

1019
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,010
Fuck yeah,

1020
00:58:59,020 --> 00:58:59,853
yeah.

1021
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:06,750
Fuck yeah.

1022
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,713
Okay

1023
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,430
man.
That's his mouth.

1024
00:59:59,150 --> 00:59:59,983
No,

1025
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,470
there's a lot of comedy snobs out there,

1026
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:06,540
man that got no respect for Michael
Winslow. You know, I think that guy,

1027
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:10,180
that's incredible. That's amazing
genius. It's people are like, oh,

1028
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:14,890
he's making noises with his mouth. That
is completely not just what he's doing.

1029
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:20,290
He's on some crazy, another level
with that. Yeah. That is wild,

1030
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:21,400
man.
That was great.

1031
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,990
The fucking noises that he can make with
his mouth and the way he did an intune

1032
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:30,110
and even as same was good. Yeah. His
fucking Robert Plant was good. Yeah.

1033
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,473
That's amazing.

1034
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,710
You have to watch that folks who would
check that out on youtube because it's,

1035
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:37,690
it's, it's a weird thing to watch
it watch it and go like, wow.

1036
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,630
Like you really get the,
you see the guy that's his mouth

1037
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:46,870
motherfucker. You think he
smokes weed? He's got two.

1038
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,920
If he doesn't say yes, if he doesn't,
I would be shot. God, if he doesn't,

1039
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,860
he's even more impressive.
Yeah. Imagine if he does it.

1040
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,260
You got to get them high and then w shit,

1041
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:59,830
he'll take that shit to the next level
to matches the fucking noises like I

1042
01:00:59,831 --> 01:01:02,950
would make. If he doesn't, then he
got some shit. Wonder if when he met,

1043
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,641
when he fucks,

1044
01:01:03,641 --> 01:01:07,720
if he has like a little joke you guys
did a laser probably throws his voice.

1045
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,030
Tends to be other people

1046
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:15,240
who probably has that killers
cause everyone's got it. Okay.

1047
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:20,140
Now I got a cool but he's probably got
a fucking one that's in stereo while he

1048
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:24,040
probably can pretend to be different
dudes too. Yeah. Checks like damn,

1049
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,920
come in with a fucking Australian cattle
ranchers had on long mustache and a new

1050
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:35,130
voice.
I just want to eat this policy.

1051
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,600
If there was a thing like what we were
talking about earlier about actually

1052
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:44,230
having an artificial experience,
you know, and, and you know,

1053
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,200
if we ever get to the point
technologically where they can do that,

1054
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:52,180
like shut you off and tune you into
some crazy fake avatar world for like an

1055
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,960
hour, would you be willing to take that
chance? Would you be willing to try that?

1056
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:59,420
It depends. If I haven't
been China I would be um,

1057
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,880
cannot just for one hour. But
I mean, would you trust it?

1058
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,530
Would you trust it?
Do you mean would you,

1059
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,640
would you look like when you
have a second dog experience,

1060
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:12,700
the scariest part about it is right
before you're about to do it. You know,

1061
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:15,550
when you're like, fuck, I
can't fucking let go here.

1062
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,760
If people were dying from this
shit, no, I wouldn't do it.

1063
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,420
I'd wait for the what it would,
if it was the first time,

1064
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:26,400
you wouldn't want to be like the,
the first half of the artificial lip.

1065
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,330
Yeah.

1066
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:31,630
I would trust that more than trusting
like cricket mobiles thing to the Moon

1067
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:35,590
because then all the fucking
commercials if you have you been, uh,

1068
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:39,200
another person or another life,
if you have chosen spider woman,

1069
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,830
you could have cancer will fight
for you. You know what I mean?

1070
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,010
You never know these pills
that come out a year later,

1071
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:49,170
they're giving you fucking heart attacks.
Well,

1072
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:51,260
there's some of them that are certainly
doing that. Doctor [inaudible],

1073
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,240
doctor Drusen deep shit.
What's up with that?

1074
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:58,260
Doctor drew apparently was paid to
talk up or allegedly, I should say,

1075
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:03,560
paid to talk up the sexual
side effects of certain,

1076
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:08,140
um, uh, what do they call that?

1077
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:12,010
The price tag depressants, but I forget
the actual technical term. Maybe one girl,

1078
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,523
this type,

1079
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:18,590
this type of antidepressant on many people
with many formulations causes people

1080
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:19,410
to go limb,

1081
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:23,100
but some girl calls up and says she had
like 150 orgasms and then doctor drew

1082
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:26,880
was apparently pushing this stuff and
they paid him a quarter of a million

1083
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,720
dollars to do that and he didn't really
necessarily disclose that they paid him

1084
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,390
all this money allegedly.

1085
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,970
But I would like to see that girl do 150
orgasms whenever I, that'd be so hot.

1086
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,230
That bitch sounds crazy, but you
never know when people are trolling.

1087
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:42,630
She's calling loved line manage
could be totally trolling.

1088
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,810
I mean there's people completely pretend
that they have something wrong with

1089
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:48,010
them when they don't feel it. For sure.
They get a lot of people that are,

1090
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:51,360
that are legit, but they must, we
know all the trolls and the Internet.

1091
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:55,120
You don't think that people are compiling
some troll footage on Loveline can

1092
01:03:55,121 --> 01:03:57,450
check out her mattress,
see if there's any stains.

1093
01:03:57,451 --> 01:04:00,270
I'm sure if he had that much orgasms,
there's going to be a lot. Yeah,

1094
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:03,210
that's what you would do. Well, I'm not
sure if I believe your story, ma'am.

1095
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:08,070
So let me come to your house and deeply
investigate your claim by going in your

1096
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:12,240
fucking bedroom and examining your
mattress. You do you even hear yourself?

1097
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:14,610
Do you ever look at your old mattress?
I just got a new mattress.

1098
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:17,220
That's how I know I took
off my shirt rose. It was,

1099
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,140
it looked like fucking sh brown drip
like a look like a lot of liquids and

1100
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:24,000
stepping in there with
like some blood spots.

1101
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:28,830
You know a lot of different colors.
Easy over here.

1102
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:29,880
Well they say that your,

1103
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:33,630
your mattress actually gets
heavier with human skin cells.

1104
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,230
Like you know your matches when you buy
it as like x amount of weight and then

1105
01:04:37,231 --> 01:04:39,690
you have it for a couple of
years and it's like heavier.

1106
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,420
That's creepy as shit man.
We're pros. We're gross man.

1107
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:45,870
We,

1108
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:50,760
that's what dust is most of is our skin
are creepy fucking skin sheets on your

1109
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,680
bed. You know, it's key. This time around.

1110
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:56,060
I actually scrubbing everything
this time around. I got something,

1111
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:59,550
it's like these waterproof sheets where
you put it around your whole entire

1112
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:04,080
mattress and it locks it into nothing
and get in there and it's on the outside,

1113
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:07,440
it feels like nice cough cushion and then
you put your regular sheets on top of

1114
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:11,370
that and it's wholly will
make that shit not happened.

1115
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:16,370
You know like the stains and like the
all the dust and skin and bugs and it

1116
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:21,480
makes it like waterproof pretty
much to him. She goes out the code.

1117
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,750
A lot of proof sheets I think there. Oh,
so does it feel like slimy underneath,

1118
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:29,730
you know, slip around now
because it's like, it's like
on the outside it's like a,

1119
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,930
I was like that bird like
a fabric I real soft.

1120
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,870
Like almost like teddy bear on the,
okay.

1121
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,300
I would hate it back in my single days
I would hate it when girls would have

1122
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:41,850
like silk, like periods and shit during
the sex and like you just ruined my,

1123
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,180
the shit went all the way through
to the mattress. I know. It sucks.

1124
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:50,280
It sucks man. Everyone
has, not everyone, but uh,

1125
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:56,550
I'm sure you've had a mattress or two that
had like all sorts of stuff. You gotta

1126
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,220
you gotta you gotta put a towel down son?
Yeah.

1127
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,380
Or they say, no, I'm done. I stopped
yesterday and then you fuck them.

1128
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:12,420
It starts back up and then you have a
girl that works and just don't you feel

1129
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:13,810
embarrassed for the girl though.

1130
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,530
Do you ever actually get upset at a girl
if she has her period? No. No, no, no.

1131
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:20,680
I don't. I don't, but I
don't like when it's messy.

1132
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,590
I've always been so happy that someone
was willing to fuck me. I'm like, oh,

1133
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:25,840
well you made a mess.
You shit the bed. Wow.

1134
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:27,720
Let's just clean that up
and not worry about that.

1135
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,550
Is it different than blood
all over my dick that isn't,

1136
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,640
I guess washed that shit up.
There's just now I got stains on shit.

1137
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,010
There's a difference between
that. Like where you know, you,

1138
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:39,240
you fuck them in it's accidently blood
or when they just like know that their

1139
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,100
period was near and they'd like, no, I
just want to sleep naked. And you're like,

1140
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:45,700
come on. That's not taking responsibility
for having an open wound, you know? Oh,

1141
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,450
does that, does it leak out while they're,
while they're sleeping? Yeah, I guess so.

1142
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:52,960
I mean that's it. That's how it leaks
out when their panties, you know,

1143
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,160
earlier design. Yeah.
Fucking crazy design.

1144
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:01,130
Like for one time every month your,

1145
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,220
your shit just sort of doesn't happen.

1146
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:09,700
What if our dicks blood like just peed
blood all the time. It's just strange.

1147
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:13,030
It's just a strange thing that happens
when you're getting ready. Yeah.

1148
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:17,380
Just sheds the inside of your Dick
Sheds. Honey, would you blow me?

1149
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:21,010
But I'm on my period to start by doing.
Some girls would like it.

1150
01:07:21,011 --> 01:07:23,350
They want the extra protein of the blood.

1151
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:26,500
Golf chicks did want to blow you
when you were on your period.

1152
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:27,430
It'd be really hot.

1153
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,140
Yeah. We're lucky at a lot of ways,
man. We'd love to, we don't give birth.

1154
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:39,820
I've always said that men had their dicks
explode like a girl's pussy was to go

1155
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:43,210
through damage. Or if you had
to get us Aserion to have a kid,

1156
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,780
how many kids would there
be if dude's got pregnant?

1157
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:50,320
We had to have a sincerity and every time
we gave birth, I feel like, go Connie,

1158
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:53,690
I don't know. I had to work. I've got no
fucking time to have this, this hereon.

1159
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,580
Okay, I can't take me out of work
for a month. Jesus fucking Christ,

1160
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,270
glorify Dick's exploded. Imagine the
does it would want to carry a baby.

1161
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,750
That was the two options.

1162
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:08,360
You can either go the old school where we
did loads and they never used it again.

1163
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,590
That almost be almost be gay,
right?

1164
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,800
Well maybe that would be the way that
they would prevent men from having more

1165
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:16,160
than one child.
The child

1166
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,400
would come out of your deck and so you,
you impregnate,

1167
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:23,240
you have sex with a woman and a, you know,
you feel like you're impregnating her,

1168
01:08:23,241 --> 01:08:27,860
you shoot a load out, but it actually
goes back inside of you from the woman.

1169
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,980
Something that drops a
fucking hatch in there.

1170
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:34,040
You get the egg from the moment of
plants inside your body. Maybe that's it.

1171
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:36,020
There you go.
And so when the baby comes out,

1172
01:08:36,021 --> 01:08:38,960
it comes out through your deck
and boom, that's it. One kid.

1173
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:43,130
That's all you get raised
it, right? Wow, that's great.

1174
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:45,620
That's a crazy idea.
That actually is probably a good idea.

1175
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,830
That might be the best way to save the
world. We've got to reengineer people.

1176
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,650
So the babies come out of
men and their dicks explodes

1177
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,160
and that'll put everything in perspective.

1178
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,500
There will only be a thousand
people on earth though.

1179
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:03,100
Probably not even a thousand, right?
Be like a hundred a hundred feet.

1180
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,600
Little fishing villages scattered
throughout the world with dudes.

1181
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,060
It's blown out.
Dicks

1182
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,560
are you shit out a baby. That'd be
awesome. They figure out a way to,

1183
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,730
to plan a baby inside your,

1184
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:18,070
um, large. Be so selfish. You'd be like,
you really want to shit on your baby.

1185
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,990
That's ridiculous.
Then you just ruin the wedding.

1186
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:29,800
It's so ridiculous that you've made a
shit that's realistic, man. Come on.

1187
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,800
What did you used to have a
sketchy road call? Shit baby.

1188
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:39,700
My friend Amir had a really
funny joke about, and my friend,

1189
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:43,240
he was like real like
deadpan. He's like, yeah,

1190
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:48,241
my friend got his girlfriend
pregnant from anal sex.

1191
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,220
The baby looked like shit.

1192
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,790
Somebody just said that exact
same joke the other day.

1193
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,930
That was the premise of shit, baby.
Anybody. It's not like the most brilliant,

1194
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,920
you know, original thought. It was just
the way mirror did it. It was very funny.

1195
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:07,720
So funny. James Lemur was his name in
Boston. He had a, he had a different name.

1196
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:11,770
His real name is Amir, but he,
he was like a very Jewish name,

1197
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,090
but he changed it to James' name.

1198
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,250
Shit baby was about,
um,

1199
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:19,920
the opening scene is some girls getting
plowed in the ass really hard dude.

1200
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:24,030
Nuts pulls out, jumps in the shower,
she's laying there face down,

1201
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:24,811
huffing and puffing.

1202
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:29,110
The camera's zooms in on the butt and
you see come dripping out of the butthole

1203
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,910
end of the pussy.
Right Tom.

1204
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:38,220
So then she gets pregnant and
uh, she, when she has the baby,

1205
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,870
like woven into the baby's
DNA is that smell of feces.

1206
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,440
So it was just, it just, that's
the problem with the baby.

1207
01:10:46,441 --> 01:10:48,540
The baby just got just stinks.
Like shit,

1208
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:50,520
there's flies around
the baby at all times.

1209
01:10:50,521 --> 01:10:53,410
So this chick brings up
this kid as a documentary.

1210
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:57,330
This Chad brings up this kid that
smells like shit. Like what would,

1211
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,360
I mean everyone should go,

1212
01:10:58,361 --> 01:11:00,450
she's spraying on the end of
the basketball everywhere.

1213
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,380
Just constantly flies everywhere.
Smell is a weird thing.

1214
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,770
It's really weird that we all accept
that there's some invisible shit.

1215
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:12,090
Then we can take in with a hole in our
face. You know, it's kind of weird,

1216
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,040
you know, the invisible. That's awesome.

1217
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,970
Like when you walk into a,

1218
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:19,730
a good burrito place and you
smell the Mexican food cooking. Oh

1219
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:26,640
yeah. Fogo perfect example. Smelled
that meat as it's coming by. It's weird,

1220
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:30,210
man. It's like, it's a weird
invisible thing, but your,

1221
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:31,680
your nose can pick it up.

1222
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:34,830
You can even smell where things like if
you pick up your underwear and go to the

1223
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:37,680
crotch, you could smell
like that. You've worn it.

1224
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:40,680
You could smell your body on that.
That's crazy.

1225
01:11:40,681 --> 01:11:44,040
Some invisible identity
shit that you leave behind.

1226
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,350
Nothing's worse than human shit for sure.

1227
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:52,050
That bad pussy and feet,
bad feet. That's it.

1228
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:57,390
Yeah, that's right. And corpse. Anything
that's trying to keep you away from it.

1229
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,610
It's interesting how that works.
I mean it's your,

1230
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:04,611
your brain is really fine tuned to like
get away from anything that's really bad

1231
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:09,270
for you and so you sounds an alarm when
you're in the presence of a decaying

1232
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:12,810
corpse. All those chemicals set an
alarm through your system and you just,

1233
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,770
you just immediate, nobody likes it. Yeah.

1234
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,780
The thought of eating that corpse
is impossible. Some people,

1235
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,890
there's a small percentage of people
that do like it. Yeah. Oh most.

1236
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,030
Some people like, you know,
all sorts of weird things.

1237
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:28,680
The smell of a dead rotting body can
imagine that if you knew somebody that

1238
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:32,060
actually liked that and the confession
that like say I don't, I don't,

1239
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:35,820
I've never told anybody before
but I fucking love running flash.

1240
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:39,180
I think that that could be
possible like for, for anything.

1241
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:42,540
I mean I think there's people that are
nutty enough to get in love with anything

1242
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:45,630
they can get in love with
cutting their own finger.

1243
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:48,480
What's the latest with the Mat Salts?
Give me the latest.

1244
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:51,960
I know you know what the would pass
salts are and this is what it's been

1245
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:56,460
explained to me is that you can take a
drug that's an illegal drug and all you

1246
01:12:56,461 --> 01:13:00,900
have to do is change certain molecules
in that drug and then you release it.

1247
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:05,930
Like you add like a salt to it and you
release it as bath salts and you say not

1248
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:08,250
for human consumption,

1249
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:13,850
but people know what it actually is
and you can go and buy it and you're

1250
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:18,720
essentially buying like a
sort of a designer drug.

1251
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:19,351
You're,

1252
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:23,130
you're buying something that hasn't been
classified and they're really intense

1253
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:28,290
and they, they have really bad
profiles. Like if you look at like,

1254
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:29,100
um,

1255
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:34,100
there's a erowid.org that shows
a lot of trip reports and uh,

1256
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,620
whatever the compound that they're
calling, you know, there's,

1257
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,980
there's several different types.
I think I might be wrong about that.

1258
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,650
I don't think bath salts is
necessarily just one thing.

1259
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,430
I think there's been more than one,
but someone please on Twitter,

1260
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:49,740
correct me if I'm wrong.
So I think it's a,

1261
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:52,710
it's a problem of they can do
that with several different drugs.

1262
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:56,190
I think they can do that with things
that are illegal. Just change, you know,

1263
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:59,430
if meth is illegal, change
math. If a ecstasies illegal,

1264
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:02,720
change it a little bit here, change a
little bit, add a little bit here and in,

1265
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:07,590
and they're doing it without any real
research as to what kind of an effect

1266
01:14:07,591 --> 01:14:11,920
these hardcore drugs are going to have
in this sort of hybrid form. You know,

1267
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:16,810
this is just letting people
take this stuff. You know,
and people this, you know,

1268
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:19,420
I don't know how many people are taking
it and losing their fucking mind,

1269
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,450
but a few people seem to me,
it seems to be a good one.

1270
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,790
It seems to be one that's
kind of quite a fucking kick.

1271
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:29,020
Mec Chris has a new song about
taking bath salts and it's awesome.

1272
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:32,470
Did he do it? Did he actually
take power? No, no, no, no, no,

1273
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:34,780
but it's just it really addicting.
And what's one of the songs?

1274
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:37,840
What did you hear it? You're just
singing it all the time. It's like about,

1275
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:40,690
you know, doing bath salts and wanting
to eat your face off. It's great.

1276
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:45,130
But that Dude Chris, they said that
they see Chris. Yeah. Is he funny?

1277
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:48,490
Is that funny rapper? Yeah, but they
said that dude wasn't on Bass Hall.

1278
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:50,140
It's the guy that a bit
the guard's face off.

1279
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:54,790
They're saying now that he
was on marijuana reefer as,

1280
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,240
yeah. Okay. Do you want to
reveal it now? No, dude.

1281
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:02,050
That's way worse than reefer madness.
Madness propaganda.

1282
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:05,110
They never said he'll eat someone's
face. Right. That's worse.

1283
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,660
Back in the thirties I was
saying that if you smoked weed,

1284
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,870
you'd go crazy and shoot people.
Well, they didn't really have the,

1285
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:14,110
they didn't have the capacity to
test for this hidden metabolite.

1286
01:15:14,111 --> 01:15:18,180
They tested for things that were, they
were known and that's what the, uh,

1287
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,290
the argument is against it.
That they didn't,

1288
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,010
I don't know if that's correct either.
By the way,

1289
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:27,220
that's not the illegal in Vegas. So if you
want to maybe do it this weekend, guys,

1290
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:31,450
is it legal in Vegas?
Yeah. Jesus Christ. Wow.

1291
01:15:31,451 --> 01:15:33,460
I hope they take care of that.
I don't know what that is.

1292
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:35,530
That's a scary thing to me though.
You know,

1293
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,200
and the fact that these people
are breaking down medical
marijuana dispensary as

1294
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,420
while they're selling bath salts,

1295
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:45,430
but other people were there still on
bath salts. What's a funny set picture?

1296
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,940
So me on the message board,

1297
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,630
we throw it up on some chick's pussy

1298
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:59,610
[inaudible] who is slain and
Jack Tillo slain in charts.

1299
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:07,880
Hilarious. I pick, I'm going to, I'm
going to tweet this pic real quick. Wow.

1300
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:12,730
That's a hard word. Slain in jealous.
Hilarious. That's a great pick.

1301
01:16:12,731 --> 01:16:15,930
That's hilarious. That's the
Internet for you folks. Do you?

1302
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:20,800
Internet will always be on shit like that.
That's awesome.

1303
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:23,190
I'm about to tweet the pictures so
you know what we're talking about.

1304
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:28,360
I'll retweet it like, did you see this
girl with her Nice Muffler? It's like,

1305
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:32,140
Brian, do you want a podcast right
now? And you've walked looking at porn.

1306
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:36,520
You're getting distracted. If I was
your boss, oh wait, it's the message.

1307
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,170
Don't be staring at plus corporate
website. Which headquarters?

1308
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,470
You see Ted yet? Anyone? No, I have
not seen 10 yard. It's awesome.

1309
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,350
I heard it's one of the funniest movies
of all time. All right. It's hilarious.

1310
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,410
I don't love it.
I never fell in love with it,

1311
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:57,400
but it was so great the whole time
that I love. I love. I like it a lot.

1312
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:00,220
Meaning there's nothing wrong with it.
It's when it's a great movie.

1313
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:03,850
I recommend to everybody, but I
never did the extra where, Oh my God.

1314
01:17:03,851 --> 01:17:06,380
I went to buy a Ted Teddy
bear now in like, you know,

1315
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:10,370
like a freak out by Ted shirts
and stuff. Bear. I never got,

1316
01:17:10,371 --> 01:17:12,390
I never got to that level of just,

1317
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,930
it was pretty good thing into a six year
old was pretty good. Fucking crazy loud.

1318
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:20,330
Like teddy bear level. Like I bet
the SQL be a million times better.

1319
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,980
What are you talking about?

1320
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:24,890
Why would you say that you're just
spouting off crazy shit today.

1321
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,190
I if it four and a half stars. Oh five
Brian, that's pretty fucking good. Yeah,

1322
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,460
that sounds good. Awesome.
You know something fun.

1323
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:35,420
I probably kept him off
the podcast right there.

1324
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:40,390
There was a couple parts. This
asshole. Here's a couple of parts.

1325
01:17:40,391 --> 01:17:42,730
So it was red band and we're like,

1326
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:46,280
they remade a wreak make
like it was weird. Oh,

1327
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,020
check it out. They don't say
anything. Don't say a word. You fuck.

1328
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:52,850
I'm going to a director's cut.
I think it would be better.

1329
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:57,290
Maybe it is the director Scott. Fuck.
Do you know? Maybe I, yeah. Yeah.

1330
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:01,250
You don't know. There probably
is. There's mushrooms in it

1331
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:08,530
is young cocaine today. Something's
going on. I Dunno man. Yeah,

1332
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:11,240
like asleep and electrocuted.
I've been,

1333
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:16,370
what was the last summer to olive
garden? Last Sunday. Be Honest.

1334
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,700
Seriously, and I Sunday
last Sunday. All right.

1335
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,340
That's what you want to stick to the
story and I went with somebody that it's

1336
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:26,270
never been there before and it was
their first time and they had prejudged.

1337
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:29,420
I don't really want to talk about the old
guard. Are you fucking kidding me here?

1338
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,780
The fuck is wrong.
We have a couple of hours to do this.

1339
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:35,810
Don't let this guy sit and talk
about breadsticks. How about them?

1340
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:39,290
Dodgers don't make me bring in Joey Diaz.
What the fuck dude,

1341
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:42,470
why would you see then I
said what you like karate.

1342
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:44,330
Can I say one thing about the opposite?
It's kind of weird.

1343
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:47,220
Now they're combining red lobster
and olive garden test market city,

1344
01:18:47,221 --> 01:18:50,240
so you can actually choose between
both menus. Isn't that cool?

1345
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:52,990
Because they're like going bankrupt.
We're trying this thing.

1346
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,120
You haven't seen the new joined karate?
No, I haven't seen it. That's great.

1347
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:00,680
Is that he kills it because he talk about
the upcoming fights. Oh, pull it up,

1348
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:05,990
put it on. Well, how do you find
that? It's 10 planet Kush episode.

1349
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:11,120
Uh, 25 10 flag Kush. Episode 25
this weekend's going to be insane.

1350
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:16,700
That rematch that we matches the biggest
rematch of all time in my opinion,

1351
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:19,070
as far as like fights and I want
to see this is in my opinion,

1352
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:23,690
the biggest rematch of all
time. So greatest fight of
all time. Are you kidding?

1353
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,840
I'm so Loretta's fights
rematches generally.

1354
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:31,910
Cause that was something crazy.
What's up 39 you said 10th Planet Kush.

1355
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:36,700
25 25 Joey crushes it. Yeah.

1356
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:40,070
This, this is the biggest rematch
ever, right? Yeah. Here it is.

1357
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:46,190
If you wait following at mad flavor, go
fuck yourself. This is under a twister.

1358
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:51,110
Eddie on Youtube, by the way.
That's where I found God. Volume.

1359
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,193
It's going to start.

1360
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:53,300
There it is.
That's good.

1361
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:00,380
Headquarters.
It's 192 fucking degrees out there,

1362
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:02,000
but I'm going to give you a preview,

1363
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,500
but UFC one 48 I'm giving
you the poly or the year.

1364
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:09,840
Everybody's complaining going to win.
[inaudible] Anderson Chair.

1365
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:10,693
I don't give a fuck.

1366
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,270
We're just trying to get paid bitches
with a fucking Paul like first up Chad

1367
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:19,200
Mendez. Who was he fighting
guys? What the fuck?

1368
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:23,250
What Cory Mckenzie, whatever.
Whatever's fucking Cody. Mackenzie.

1369
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,120
I guess my mad Chad Mendez
coming off a fucking Nian Brazil.

1370
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,650
Let me tell you something.
If you got a brill,

1371
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:32,610
a knee and Connecticut and a knee in
Brazil, two different fucking stories.

1372
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,150
He's coming back. He's going to beat
up. I'm Mackenzie. That's one lock.

1373
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:39,960
My second lock is Damien
Maia against Yum yum. Cam.

1374
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,430
Damien's dropping down the fucking
one 70 he's a Jujitsu maniac.

1375
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:47,760
All over sudden he wants to be Muhammad
Ali. He's going to go up against young,

1376
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:48,570
young Kim,

1377
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:52,590
a black belt in judo flip
and motherfuckers like
cow per region before the

1378
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:55,230
fucking painkillers.
Amazing. You understand me?

1379
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,400
He's going to get fucking van in
Maya at one 70 and he's done duck.

1380
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,760
So that's my parlay is yum.
Yum Kim.

1381
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:06,000
I guess y'all can make money or you want
to fucking play games with the other

1382
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:10,830
buddies. Now you're saying Joey, what
about Tito against far as Griffin,

1383
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,550
10 fucking psychics under strip. Can't
pick that one. You understand me?

1384
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,690
All I know is I'm watching some interview
show with Tina. I love him to death.

1385
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:21,780
He's a hall of fame and they're
like, Tito, why are you quitting?

1386
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:24,900
Why the fuck is he quitting? He's
won one in six. You understand me?

1387
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:28,470
It's time to go cup soccer. That's all
I can tell you. I love you the deck.

1388
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:32,400
Congratulations. You and forest
Whitaker. I love the fucking fight,

1389
01:21:32,401 --> 01:21:34,110
but I wouldn't bet you
motherfuckers at all.

1390
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:38,940
Another fight on the card is commonly
the flying fucking master of kicks on

1391
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:42,300
Cinemax versus the comeback.
The leg. What's his name?

1392
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:46,470
Patrick fucking coat. Tank
fighting. I'll come back in.

1393
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:50,890
The UFC slipped that one in. So you've
got Kung Lee against fucking Damon.

1394
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:55,100
Who's he fighting? Oh, he's
fighting. Uh, Patrick Hotel.

1395
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,880
The one fucking legged man from Canada.

1396
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,480
And I'm going with Patrick coattail apps
a squeezing. Now you're going to Joey.

1397
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,390
What about channel? What about,
and I'm going to give it to you.

1398
01:22:03,391 --> 01:22:06,480
Fucking straighten daddy. Right?
Channel Center is a fucking champion.

1399
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:10,830
He took it down. This is silver. Whatever.
Anderson silvers are fucking savage.

1400
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,360
You're right.
He worked at Mcdonald's.

1401
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:16,830
He was making big macs fucking 15 years
ago. He's angry. He went down to Brazil.

1402
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:19,290
He thought about it and you
hugged this 19 fucking kids.

1403
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,960
He's got a bus full of kids,
Anderson, and he's back.

1404
01:22:21,961 --> 01:22:24,620
He's going to Las Vegas this weekend.
Let me tell you something, channel.

1405
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,570
I love you to death,

1406
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,200
but it's all over the shot and
I don't care what the odds are.

1407
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:33,180
I don't care what fucking, uh,
Kenny Florian says, or Jon,
Anik, I don't give a fuck.

1408
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:35,760
This is going to be ugly.
I'm going with my man,

1409
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:38,460
Anderson Silva to
fucking take it to champ.

1410
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,880
The last time he fought bad and he
got him in the fifth fucking around.

1411
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:44,490
They got beat up. Can you imagine
a healthy fucking Anderson Silva?

1412
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,700
Take your little fucking panties.
Forget going to the Strip club.

1413
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,450
Put It on the Anderson. You got the
fucking Parlay Mendez and who else?

1414
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,610
What the fuck people are you all
sleeping here? [inaudible] yum, yum.

1415
01:22:56,611 --> 01:23:00,180
Kim Against Cody Mackenzie. Paula. Oh Yum.

1416
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:01,930
Yum Kim against my man.
Fuck

1417
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,260
10 plan to take it from that.

1418
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,990
Tim is not fighting. Chad Mendez.
Cody Mckinsey's fighting Chad. Man.

1419
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,370
Fuck it all up. Motherfuckers right
there. Oh my God, he's so high.

1420
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:21,070
Our apologies to the grade Dong Young
Kim for Joey Diaz messing up his word.

1421
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:25,690
Calling them yum. Yum Kim.
That's uh, that's Kinda rude.

1422
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:29,240
How dare he, I thought it
was hilarious. Pissed off.

1423
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,880
Like people are calling them yum.
Yum Kim. Now all over the inner,

1424
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:34,380
what do you think about Damien
Maia dropping down to one 70?

1425
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:39,330
Uh, he's uh, he's going
to be a big one 70.

1426
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:42,980
If he can do it right, it'll be, can do
and be healthy for folks who don't know,

1427
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:44,960
you know, follow MMA. Damien Maia,

1428
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:48,410
is this one of the best Jujitsu
guys to ever enter into MMA?

1429
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:53,600
He's a multiple time world champion. Just
so really killer technical Jujitsu guy.

1430
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:57,380
And he entered into MMA and for awhile
he was strangling a lot of people,

1431
01:23:57,381 --> 01:24:01,070
including Chael Sonnen. Uh, he got
Chael Sonnen, a mounted triangle.

1432
01:24:01,071 --> 01:24:05,990
Remember that Shit. Hold them on.
Yeah, he uh, he, he took them down.

1433
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,730
Remember that?
What the fuck did he use?

1434
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,760
Was it a lateral drop?

1435
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:14,640
I think it was a lot drive him off guard
cause child did not think he was going

1436
01:24:14,641 --> 01:24:15,300
to take them down.
Yeah.

1437
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,090
Didn't think he was going to try
that move. Yeah. He liked lateral,

1438
01:24:18,091 --> 01:24:21,720
dropped him and then mounted
triangle. Tim, it was so sweet man.

1439
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:26,400
It was like really the the quickest
I've ever seen shale gets submitted.

1440
01:24:26,401 --> 01:24:31,050
It was like when he got taken down
it was like bang, whoop. Oh Shit.

1441
01:24:31,051 --> 01:24:34,860
He's caught tap. It was,
it was just his Jujitsu.

1442
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:39,000
Damien Maia when he's on, when he
catches you is so picture perfect man.

1443
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:43,560
He's such a beast and if he's able to
get ahold of guys at one 70 he'll be even

1444
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:44,110
better.

1445
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:48,220
But it's about whether or not this is
healthy and whether or not he could still

1446
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:50,230
take him down at one 70
and there's monsters.

1447
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,010
Jake shields guys that he's not
going to be able to take down. Yeah.

1448
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:57,790
I think his Jujitsu, you make one mistake
with Damien. My you're fucked. Yeah.

1449
01:24:57,791 --> 01:25:01,150
He's a finisher. He knows how to close
the deal. He catches you in a triangle.

1450
01:25:01,151 --> 01:25:04,300
It's oversight. You're not
escaping. He's totally professional.

1451
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:06,670
When it comes to submissions,
I just liked it,

1452
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:11,730
liked it better when he had more faith
in his half guard because you know,

1453
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:16,060
early UFC days he wouldn't hesitate
to pull guard. He pulled guard,

1454
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,750
he actually pulled half guard and there's
a big difference between jumping guard,

1455
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:22,390
pulling guard and pulling half guard.
He pulled half guard.

1456
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:26,680
He had a lot of faith in his half guard
in the early, um, early UFC fights,

1457
01:25:26,681 --> 01:25:31,681
but he likes to stand more now and he
has totally made a conscious decision not

1458
01:25:32,051 --> 01:25:34,240
to pull guard,
not to have that as an option.

1459
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,390
And I think you should
reconsider that option.

1460
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:41,890
And look at what Paul Sas is doing.
He's just, when Paul Sas fights,

1461
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:46,210
he's completely taken the dude's wrestling
and striking out of the mix because

1462
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:50,530
if Paul Sas is fighting a Combo
fighter who's a world champion,

1463
01:25:50,531 --> 01:25:54,220
kickboxer Killen and
k one, and he's a, uh,

1464
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:58,520
a Olympian rustler to him, he's going
to pull guard anyway, so he'd come,

1465
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:02,950
he takes those two, uh, um,
skill sets out of the picture.

1466
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,060
I'm not saying that you should
just go out there and pull garlic,

1467
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:07,750
but you should have a guard like
Paul Sassy should pull guard. Yeah.

1468
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,550
And Damien Maia does have a
guard by Paul says he does.

1469
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,640
He has a very dangerous guy.
Damien Maia is, God is amazing.

1470
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:18,590
He just is chosen not to have
that as an option anymore.

1471
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:22,010
And I think I always call it the third
option and it should be an option in your

1472
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:23,630
game.
You should.

1473
01:26:23,631 --> 01:26:28,070
What do you think keeps him from
getting hit on the ground? I think, um,

1474
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:32,110
well a lot of people think
that they say they're,

1475
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:35,120
that they don't work on their guard
techniques are there half guard.

1476
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:36,200
They don't refine it.

1477
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:40,220
Because in MMA when you're on your back,

1478
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:44,810
you're losing. That's what that's
like. The thing to say about that,

1479
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:46,070
and professional fighters,

1480
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:50,630
a lot of them think that this way that if
you're on your back, you're losing. Yes.

1481
01:26:50,631 --> 01:26:55,190
But you're also losing. If you're on
your feet getting tattooed with punches,

1482
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:56,540
you're also losing their,

1483
01:26:56,541 --> 01:27:00,290
so what's the difference if you're losing
on your feet and lose it on the ground,

1484
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,980
at least if you have a
really good half guard game,

1485
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:07,790
you have a really good full guard game.
You have a really dangerous rubber guard.

1486
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,650
If you've got a lot of heat off your back,

1487
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:13,940
there is a way for you to win off
your back. Instead of, I'm on my back,

1488
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:18,440
I'm losing. There's no hope
if Aoki, he's on his back.

1489
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:19,790
There is hope for him.

1490
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:23,290
When you remember when Jason Day fought
Alan Belcher and just held him and

1491
01:27:23,291 --> 01:27:25,820
rubber guard and elbowed them,
you could just do that.

1492
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:28,310
You could just hold it a dude in
mission control and throw elbows.

1493
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:32,930
It's been proven that it's very effective.
It's out there. The evidence is there,

1494
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:35,950
but just, you know, we just got
to get wicked good at it. I mean,

1495
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:38,180
they're like a guy who's going to
pull it off as a guy like Vinny,

1496
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:42,220
Vinny Magalhaes. He's going to
be able to pull it up. If it it,

1497
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,290
if he could get the fight to the ground
because vending is not the greatest

1498
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,860
restaurant on the planet and he's not
the greatest striker on the planet.

1499
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:52,610
He is improving both vastly. He's
working on it and he, he has accepted,

1500
01:27:52,611 --> 01:27:53,810
I talked to him personally.

1501
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:58,400
He has accepted that he will pull guard
if he can't take the guy down because

1502
01:27:58,401 --> 01:28:01,190
there's only three things you can do in
a fight, and I've said this many times,

1503
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,680
there's only three things.
You could stand with a guy,

1504
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:07,910
you could try to take a guy down
or you can pull guard. That's it.

1505
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:11,090
There's no other way to fight. You
fight in her feet, you gotta fight,

1506
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,650
you try to take them down or your pull
guard. Most people only have two options.

1507
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,720
If they can't take the guy down,

1508
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:21,110
they better be able to beat him
standing or they lost. Just like that.

1509
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,270
I wish that the cutting weight was
not in the equation. This bothers me,

1510
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:29,210
but, but this is what I'm talking
about has nothing to do with, wait.

1511
01:28:29,211 --> 01:28:33,040
What I'm talking about is having the,
are having strategy ways. Three ways.

1512
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:34,910
The win.
Most fighters only have two ways.

1513
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:38,840
I think the fighter of the future
is going to have three ways to win.

1514
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:42,110
He's going to be a serious striker
and can fucking knock you out.

1515
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:43,820
But if shit ain't going right standing,

1516
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:47,180
he can take you down cause he
has a Olympic Jon Jones. Yeah,

1517
01:28:47,181 --> 01:28:52,181
wrestling or if he can't take you down
or if you can't take your opponent down

1518
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,310
and he's beating you standing.
If you have a wicked guard,

1519
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:57,580
you have the option to pull guard.
Like Paul Saskatoon,

1520
01:28:57,650 --> 01:29:00,740
he wins all his fights by pulling guard.
It's his first option.

1521
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,900
I don't agree that it should
be a first option all the time.

1522
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:08,580
I think I would want my fighters to get
as good as possible with our striking

1523
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:11,880
and the wrestling. If you could take
a guy down, don't fucking pull guard.

1524
01:29:11,881 --> 01:29:15,150
Take his ass down. If you can beat
him standing, don't take them down.

1525
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:17,220
Keep standing with them. You're
fucking, you own this guy.

1526
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,240
But if the god of my fighters getting
own standing and it can't take the guy

1527
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:24,600
down, you have to pull guard.
That's the only thing you can do.

1528
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:28,290
And the guys that are missing an easy
thing to pull off. It's not easy.

1529
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:31,860
You just don't sit. I'm not talking
about specialists, Paul Sas opponents.

1530
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:35,160
I know what he's looking to do.
Pulling Guard has become very complex.

1531
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:37,290
You've got to understand the
difference between jumping guard,

1532
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:40,980
jumping guard is when you're against the
fence like Stefan struve did. He was,

1533
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,900
he had his back against the fence,

1534
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:46,170
so it was really easy because he
was being pinned on the fence.

1535
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,290
Really easy to just jump up and
go Koala on him. He jumped guard,

1536
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:53,400
pulled them down and went right to an
arm bar. It works. There's an option.

1537
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:57,450
There's a way out.
Anytime you're on your back in a fight,

1538
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:59,400
any all fighters out there,

1539
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,940
anytime you've been on your back
and had a guy on a full guard,

1540
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:07,600
you actually had an opportunity to beat
that guy right there. That's an odd,

1541
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:12,350
it's not, don't look at that last
time. Dinny Magallanes guard,

1542
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,790
Shinya Aoki Guard.

1543
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:19,710
There's only a few people who've really
taken the time to master fighting off

1544
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:21,380
your back because most fighters coming in,

1545
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,060
they listened to their instructors
and the instructors say, Oh,

1546
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:25,620
if you're on your back,
you're losing. Well,

1547
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:28,980
especially if you mean you get on your
back with a fucking big Russell that you

1548
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:31,620
can't hold onto it like a Jake
Ellenberger type character.

1549
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:35,220
It's going to ground and
pound your fucking face off.
That's a scary spot to be.

1550
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:37,620
You know,
currently you have to have,

1551
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,830
it's not that scary if
you're Vinnie Magallanes.

1552
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:44,430
He wants you to be on top and start being
aggressive and start punching Fabrizio

1553
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:45,910
over doing exactly what we're doing.

1554
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:49,610
Ryan Parsons was talking about when
they train ground and pound for ratios,

1555
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,690
like none of this stuff works on him.
Was Guard is so good.

1556
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:55,050
He's always like feed on your
hips and feet on your shoulders.

1557
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:00,040
The one dimensional fighter we already
know, they're gone, they're gone.

1558
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:02,520
There are retired or any one
dimensional and then you've got like two

1559
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:03,331
dimensional fighters.

1560
01:31:03,331 --> 01:31:06,720
There's guys that can have pretty good
stand up and there were good wrestlers.

1561
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:09,210
Jiu Jitsu ain't that good.
Those guys aren't going to last you.

1562
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:14,040
That you have to be really good at all
aspects of the game. Striking, wrestling,

1563
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:19,140
top game, Jujitsu and bottom and game,
Jujitsu. You have to be good at all,

1564
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:23,930
all those levels. I think in the
future right now it's, you know, um,

1565
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:26,280
it's,
it's not um,

1566
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:31,700
a popular view too in the MMA world to
really focus and Polish up your bottom

1567
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,870
game. That's not a thing you want to do
because that's like admitting you already

1568
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:40,380
lost. That's like admitting that you're
wrestling is not going to be good enough

1569
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:42,660
admitting that you're not
a fucking fierce striker,

1570
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:45,810
admitting that you're afraid to
stand and strike with someone.

1571
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:46,921
That's what a lot of guys,

1572
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:50,040
a lot of guys want to go out there and
there's Jujitsu guys and there's a bunch

1573
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:52,230
of them. I don't want to name names,
but a lot of guys go out there.

1574
01:31:52,231 --> 01:31:55,800
They're Jujitsu world champions
and they want to stand and trade.

1575
01:31:55,801 --> 01:32:00,050
They want to be kickboxers now, you
know? And it's of weird. And then, yeah,

1576
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,380
there's a lot of them and it's,

1577
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:05,290
I think this is my experience.

1578
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:09,400
I think that to get over that,
most Jujitsu fighters,

1579
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,990
a lot of them generally have a fear of
doing standup because they're not that

1580
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:15,250
good at it.
It's not their sport.

1581
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:18,100
Now they're thrust into a kickboxing
sport where they're not that good.

1582
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,600
They spent their whole life on the ground.

1583
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:23,500
So there is an element of fear because
you can get knocked the fuck out.

1584
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:28,680
So to conquer that fear and to fucking
Stanwood professional strikers and get

1585
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:32,140
some fucking licks in and take the shots,

1586
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:36,470
I can see that empowering that and making
them feel like a fierce warrior with

1587
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:39,670
like, fuck pulling guard. This is awesome.

1588
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:43,750
I'm actually standing with professional
strikers taking their shit and knocking

1589
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:48,400
dudes out every now and then, fuck yeah,
I'm standing. I can see them, you know,

1590
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:51,730
really liking that rush, you know,
that feeling. I conquered fear,

1591
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:53,200
you know what I mean?
It feels good.

1592
01:32:53,201 --> 01:32:56,050
Like they don't give a fuck about getting
hit. I think it makes them feel good.

1593
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,240
It's not the best strategy to win a fight,

1594
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:03,340
but for their own personal empowerment
and it's, I'm sure it's glorious,

1595
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,640
you know, I can see that. You know
when George George l goes out there,

1596
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:10,480
he's a black belt in Jujitsu.
He fucking loves the trade.

1597
01:33:10,481 --> 01:33:14,860
He loves that Shit. It makes them
feel like a fucking savage, you know?

1598
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:19,180
I can see that. I'm like
okay, I understand if fucking
having a good time. Yeah.

1599
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:21,370
Cause that's takes a lot of
bottles of the actually do it.

1600
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:24,760
It's like base jumping. You know,
you can only do that for so long.

1601
01:33:24,761 --> 01:33:29,320
You can only take so much. It's not
easy. It's not an unlimited resource.

1602
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:32,680
So back to Damien Maia,
I think if you're listening out there,

1603
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:36,370
I loved it when he used to pull half
guard. If you could take the guy down,

1604
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:39,610
take the guy down, stay on
top. That's not happening.

1605
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,480
Maybe it's going to be healthy and
fast or one 71 70 or make them faster.

1606
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:46,780
Then he said he will not hesitate
pulling guard if he can't.

1607
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:50,140
If he can't take the guy down, he, he'll
try always try to take the guy down.

1608
01:33:50,141 --> 01:33:53,260
But if he can't, he won't hesitate any.
And that gives him a lot of confidence.

1609
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:56,470
He talks to me and that gives him
conference one way or the other.

1610
01:33:56,471 --> 01:33:59,920
I'm going to drag the fight to the
ground and bring them into my world. No,

1611
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:02,290
no longer is he gonna
pretend to be a kickboxer.

1612
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:06,970
Did you see Brian Ebersol's fight
with Tj Walberger? Yes. Yes.

1613
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:11,330
Brian Aerosol is hard to
choke. Man. That guy's weird.

1614
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:13,540
Even though Tj Walberger lost,

1615
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:16,830
I think he has a lot of
potential and he looked great.

1616
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:20,230
He just needs to tighten up a lot of
shit to keep going and keep polishing his

1617
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:24,580
game. But as guard look dangerous as
hell ever saw is really hard to tap.

1618
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:26,410
There's something going
on with that guy man.

1619
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:29,230
Cause like he talks about like
the myth of the Guillotine.

1620
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:31,710
Like people can't tap him
with a good team. You know,

1621
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,950
I don't know what his deal is.

1622
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:36,010
He might have large a orders
in his neck or something. Yeah.

1623
01:34:36,011 --> 01:34:39,400
Or maybe he's just been grappling for so
long that he could just fight that shit

1624
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:41,530
off. You know? Maybe he knows
how to fight that shit off,

1625
01:34:41,531 --> 01:34:44,980
but he doesn't tap to give teens. He
says, he says gay teens are a myth.

1626
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,990
I wonder if he's a freak.
I think Marcello can tap them though.

1627
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:53,560
Marcello's he'll give it to you because
Marcello's guillotine the Marcella team.

1628
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,620
I think it's the best choke in
the game. It's a May. It's proven.

1629
01:34:57,621 --> 01:35:02,090
The research is out there. If you really
want to find the best choke in the game,

1630
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:06,290
you should know as many jokes as possible.
But the best one for sure,

1631
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:09,880
the research, the evidence, it's
all out there. The Marcella tin,

1632
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:12,200
the way Marcella does his
guillotines study that shit.

1633
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,120
Cause what is the main difference?

1634
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:17,030
He's not choking you like
it sound like a blood choke.

1635
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:21,260
He's smashing your throat so you tap real
quick. They're really quick. Taps is,

1636
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:23,150
if you've got a gun
arm and guillotine you,

1637
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:26,960
you might have to crank it maybe
1520 seconds, maybe 30 seconds.

1638
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:31,360
You're twisting and maybe 35 seconds,
Bam. He finally gives up in tops. Right.

1639
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,740
You know the Marcella
team comes in a flash,

1640
01:35:33,741 --> 01:35:35,390
your throat gets smashed
and you start tapping.

1641
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:37,160
It's a different kind of guillotine.

1642
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:39,770
It's the most effective
guillotine out there by far.

1643
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:41,210
There's it put guys to sleep still,

1644
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:45,380
even though it's smashing the throat or
is it just all pain? From my experience,

1645
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:50,020
people are just tapping from
the pain. Huh? Sometimes.

1646
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:53,420
But it is kind of a a choke where
you can't breathe. Right. You know,

1647
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:55,700
you're throwing it to being smashed. You
can't breathe. You've got to top quick.

1648
01:35:55,701 --> 01:35:59,570
So if you can't breathe
because your throat,

1649
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:04,040
your throat is getting blocked. Do you
fall asleep? Maybe you still fall asleep?

1650
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:06,390
I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I, I've,

1651
01:36:06,391 --> 01:36:09,660
I've never seen a guy who
had been more impressed with,

1652
01:36:09,661 --> 01:36:12,180
with his choke defense than
ever saw. He's crazy. Yeah.

1653
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:15,060
He doesn't even seem uncomfortable.
He just gives, his head,

1654
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:18,300
gets all red and he guts it out and
then he's on top throwing bombs.

1655
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:21,960
It seems like he just, he's really hard
to choke. Yeah. He's a warrior man.

1656
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,460
Tough fucking dude,
man.

1657
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:26,790
I'm a big fan of Brian ever saw and a
guy who's not afraid of getting choked

1658
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:30,030
like that, he can put himself into
all kinds of weird situations.

1659
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,490
It's very strange.
You know,

1660
01:36:32,491 --> 01:36:37,190
I'm a fan of anybody who has the balls
to throw to just do a cartwheel kit. Oh,

1661
01:36:37,230 --> 01:36:40,050
you know what I mean? How else
people come on. That's, this is the,

1662
01:36:40,051 --> 01:36:42,990
this is the kick that, uh, people
thought it was a fake fight. You know,

1663
01:36:42,991 --> 01:36:45,750
he got in like a situation
when the commission people
thought that he had a fake

1664
01:36:45,751 --> 01:36:46,980
fight.
Like it was pro wrestling.

1665
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:49,680
Like they didn't believe that you
could actually kick somebody like that.

1666
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:53,910
That's crazy. That shit has
a lot of power. That's like
a, a wheel kick ass kick,

1667
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,730
you know, like, uh, in more
powerful than that really,

1668
01:36:56,731 --> 01:36:59,580
because it's good gravity going in it.
What kind of kick?

1669
01:36:59,581 --> 01:37:04,290
What's it called to cartwheel.
Kick cartwheel. Okay. Yeah,
that's what I'm, uh, on. Um,

1670
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:09,570
Steve Genom, uh, was Harold Howard tried
it on Steve Genom. Yeah. But that shit,

1671
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:14,520
he came, he left c three was it
three came out and cartwheel kicked.

1672
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,780
It was a legit technique in like a
karate point fighting and, and different,

1673
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:21,140
you know, I think that was
probably like the root of it.

1674
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,090
It was karate I think was the root of
it. But it's, it fucking works, man.

1675
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,560
If you learn how to do it right,

1676
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:30,000
you could nail somebody ever sells
knock guys out with it. He tried it.

1677
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:33,600
He tried it on a Tj.
He's a wild motherfucker.

1678
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:37,550
He's got to fight again in Calgary.
They just added him onto a,

1679
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,610
to that car I think.

1680
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,170
So He'd be fighting like you just
a few weeks after his last fight.

1681
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,390
What do you think about Tito forest?
I think it's a good,

1682
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:50,990
it's good when guys are,
uh,

1683
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:54,240
they've had a great careers and they're,
you know,

1684
01:37:54,241 --> 01:37:58,050
probably to the end of those great
careers and they're fighting each other.

1685
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:00,070
I like that.
What,

1686
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:04,500
what gets me concerned is when I see
like one of these guys that's been in the

1687
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:08,610
game a long time is a legend of the game
and he's fighting like a top young lion

1688
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,340
that, that I always feel
like, Ooh, I don't really, I
don't want to you like those.

1689
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,480
Yeah. Cause it's like a rocky
story. They could pull it out.

1690
01:38:15,481 --> 01:38:19,370
I remember rocking 65 when it came back.
Yes. But there's some guys that, you know,

1691
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,350
they cross a threshold where you don't
want, you don't want to see them get hurt.

1692
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:24,670
Like they crossed the threshold
where you see them, you know,

1693
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,960
get laid out a couple of times
and you're like, all right, I'm,

1694
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,700
I'm not really in the scene. This
dude get hurt any further. You know,

1695
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:32,130
especially by some young
killer, you know, you see some,

1696
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,200
some young dude who just
just has lightening fast
strikes and just comes in and

1697
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:39,370
lights him up.
What do you think about young,

1698
01:38:39,371 --> 01:38:43,650
young Kim and don young and dumb
mine? Kim, what do you think?

1699
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,850
I think Kim is getting really good
with his kickboxing is uh, you know,

1700
01:38:47,851 --> 01:38:52,470
his movement and his feet is way
better. Don Young Tim, he's got,

1701
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:54,180
um,
who did he rock?

1702
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:58,710
You rock somebody with a like a jumping
front kick to the face and then finished

1703
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:00,720
him off. What the fuck
was a, I don't remember,

1704
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,930
but Damien Maia striking
is getting better as well.

1705
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:08,370
It is not afraid to throw down.
Well he and his striking is pretty decent.

1706
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:13,170
He hurt. Um, uh, um, uh, Mark
Munoz. He tagged Mark Munoz.

1707
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:15,490
I think you were really surprised
the shit out of them. It's,

1708
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:19,470
there's a couple of Brazilians that are
turning into illegit Stryker's a Damien

1709
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:22,220
Maia and fraud buddies or
we're doomed. Yes. Yeah.

1710
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:26,610
For breached over doing this
crazy watching guys blossom,
right? Yeah. He's got a,

1711
01:39:26,611 --> 01:39:30,780
um, I mean for Reesey over dooms
got like a real kickboxing game now.

1712
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:35,820
Throws nasty knees, leg kicks. He calmed.
I'm that dude with an uppercut, you know,

1713
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:39,930
a clean upper cut. He's dangerous
guy. That's a big dude, man.

1714
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:43,410
When you stand next to Fabricio Werdum
his fucking feet are like that big.

1715
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:47,560
His hands are, but that's
a real heavyweight. He's
saying motherfucking hands,

1716
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:52,080
you know, and press the fuck out of
me, Charles on Olivera man. God Damn,

1717
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:54,950
that is a true savage.
Right.

1718
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,610
Then Sean Pearson was the guy that don't
young Kim hit with a jumping front kick

1719
01:39:59,611 --> 01:40:02,970
in the face and Sean Pearson's
fucking good man. And you know he's,

1720
01:40:02,971 --> 01:40:07,590
he's got a victory over Nate Diaz. He's
got a victory over a mirror set. Dolla.

1721
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,820
He's fucking good man.

1722
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:11,880
Don Young Kim is good and he's no joke
and he's not scared to go to the ground

1723
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:16,050
either. He's strong as fuck. He's a
really good judo guy. Real good defense.

1724
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:20,280
You know, so cause he'd be, it could
be or it could be a submission man.

1725
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,510
It could be a submission.

1726
01:40:21,511 --> 01:40:25,380
They could go to the ground and Danny
Meyer might just lock them up and one 70

1727
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:26,840
if he can come in healthy,
you know,

1728
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:31,020
if he weighs like a healthy one 85
one 90 or something, come fight time.

1729
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:34,350
That's going to be weird to say.
But how old is Damien?

1730
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:38,470
He's probably in his mid thirties
probably 30 to 35 or something like that.

1731
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:40,490
I should find out before
I talk a lot about,

1732
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:44,700
cause that has an effect also on cutting
a big amount of weight this late in

1733
01:40:44,701 --> 01:40:47,850
your career. It's going to be interesting
to see what it looks like it's sending.

1734
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:50,760
I'm sure he's a smart guy though.
If he's doing anything,

1735
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:55,390
I'm sure that he's doing it the right way.
34 if he's doing anything,

1736
01:40:55,391 --> 01:40:58,640
you know he spends a lot of time
training with a lot of wrestlers and I'm,

1737
01:40:58,641 --> 01:41:02,380
I'm sure they're going to give him like
the exact right way to do it and you

1738
01:41:02,381 --> 01:41:05,020
know he's not,
he's such a bright guy.

1739
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:09,370
I would assume that he would absolutely
do it the correct way and he would only

1740
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:12,670
not, I mean it must have made
some, some test runs, but I,

1741
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:15,390
I have a split feelings on shit like that.

1742
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:19,840
I just think it's so unhealthy when
dudes cut a shit load of weight.

1743
01:41:19,841 --> 01:41:23,530
I was just like, man, I don't
think you should cut that
much weight. It's so crazy.

1744
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,930
It's so,
it just seems so unhealthy.

1745
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:29,050
It seems like there's a
point of diminishing return
than a lot of guys cross

1746
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:33,350
over. You know, I think you get to around
like eight, 10 pounds, five pounds,

1747
01:41:33,351 --> 01:41:36,310
something like that. That's nothing.
That's good. That's fine. That's fine.

1748
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:39,280
That's barely even gonna hurt you.
You're going to be fine. You know, you,

1749
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,810
you go back and refuel. But when dudes
are cut in 25, 30 pounds like there,

1750
01:41:43,811 --> 01:41:48,811
Anthony Johnson and that it coming in
like weighing almost 200 pounds and

1751
01:41:48,881 --> 01:41:53,550
they're finding it one 70.
That's of crazy. It's weird.
It's like, how do you, uh,

1752
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:57,690
how do you f how do you stop that though?
How do you tell people that they, uh,

1753
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:02,170
they can't do that anymore? Well, if you
can make it, then that's your spot. Yeah.

1754
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:05,500
You know, that's where they should be.
If you could make it, that's your spot.

1755
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:07,960
I know,
but what a weird way to do business.

1756
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:11,860
Like everybody has to almost
kill themselves the day
before we're going to fight.

1757
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:15,970
Everybody has to literally starve to
the point where you're really unhealthy.

1758
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:17,710
Look terrible.

1759
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:21,220
There's a lot of guys to step on the
scale 24 hours before a big fight and they

1760
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:25,830
don't look good at all. You know, it's
crazy. Who knows that more than you? Yeah.

1761
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:30,850
Or there's guys like Bj Penn who would
choose to fight at one 70 and he doesn't

1762
01:42:30,851 --> 01:42:34,420
even really weigh one seven he
would weigh like one 66 you know,

1763
01:42:34,421 --> 01:42:36,310
and Bj fought like Matt Hughes,

1764
01:42:36,311 --> 01:42:40,720
I think he was like one 66 he's been
as low as like one 64 and he's fighting

1765
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:44,890
welterweights you know, is this
that way to do it too. I mean,

1766
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:48,520
Frankie Edgar one lightweight title,
you know,

1767
01:42:48,521 --> 01:42:53,470
that way by being a real hundred 55 pound
dude fighting dudes who are, you know,

1768
01:42:53,471 --> 01:42:57,340
probably like one 75 maybe
come python maybe even. Yeah,

1769
01:42:57,610 --> 01:43:01,620
I mean gray Maynard was a big dude.
He's thick as fuck man. You know,

1770
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:04,270
I don't know how much great cuts,
but he looks big. He's like,

1771
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,460
gets to be two 30 during off season.

1772
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:11,550
It didn't like Oberg said he gets
to like 200 or something though.

1773
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:16,560
He's been to probably probably like Joe
Stevenson used to hover around 200 for

1774
01:43:16,841 --> 01:43:19,510
launch. She cut down to 55
same thing with Chris Brennan.

1775
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:23,650
Did you see Joe Stevenson? He left
the EOC and they just lost that dude,

1776
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:26,880
Dakota Cochran,
the guy who had been in a,

1777
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:31,390
he had like some sort of
a career and a gay porn.

1778
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,340
He thought Justin Lin said yeah.
Undercard and you know,

1779
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:37,030
you don't know this whole
thing about tough. Yeah,

1780
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:41,470
he was on the ultimate fighter and he
had a, it needed some money in this past.

1781
01:43:41,471 --> 01:43:44,550
So he did some gay porn and
they let him on the show. Okay.

1782
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:49,330
And I thought that was a, I thought that
was cool. I was like, alright. You know,

1783
01:43:49,331 --> 01:43:52,490
like why not man let the kid on the show,
why wouldn't you let him on the show?

1784
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:55,310
Isn't a show all about like trying
to get your shit together. I mean,

1785
01:43:55,311 --> 01:43:56,960
how many of the guys that are
on the show have been in jail?

1786
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:59,630
How many of you guys on the jail,
the show been in jail for assault?

1787
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:01,880
Is it had been any, I don't
know. It might not been any.

1788
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:04,740
It probably wouldn't allow you to do.
Right.

1789
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:08,030
They'd probably like make sure that
they didn't get responsible for anybody.

1790
01:44:08,031 --> 01:44:10,700
That was dangerous. I don't even know
the answer to that question, but,

1791
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:15,440
so the dude had a little prominence past.
It's in the past now. Unfortunately.

1792
01:44:15,441 --> 01:44:18,770
This is a video of it and they let him
on the show. Oh, I think that's cool.

1793
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:22,310
But he didn't make it and he lost.
But he's good man. He's fucking good.

1794
01:44:22,311 --> 01:44:25,130
He's real good. He beat Joseph.
Fuck Joe Daddy up, dude.

1795
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,950
Fuck Joe Daddy upstanding then caught
them on the ground and got them in a rear

1796
01:44:27,951 --> 01:44:31,940
naked and finished him. Wow, dude. And he
had, he had his back a couple of times.

1797
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:36,470
He fucked Joe up, man. He's good. He's
good. He's explosive. He's really fast.

1798
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:39,290
Who did he lose two on the
ultimate fighter? I don't
know, Brian. All right. Sure.

1799
01:44:41,410 --> 01:44:45,170
He may have gotten hurt. I think
he, I think you're right. Yeah.

1800
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,280
I think you're right. Maybe it's
the last season, right? Yeah,

1801
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:50,560
because I saw the last
season. It was good. Yeah.

1802
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:55,870
I don't know what the fuck happened
to him. So we should look it up.

1803
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,410
Are Chryslers and the show
starts tonight at nine.

1804
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:03,090
We're talking about it and my son
trip flip. He's watching right now.

1805
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:06,190
He says he's a sweetie.
I'm

1806
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,453
trying to find out

1807
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,270
what about, so all of a sudden, what
do you think we think's going? Go down.

1808
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,330
I mean anything could happen really.

1809
01:45:16,331 --> 01:45:20,290
We can see the exact same fight again
and this time son and pulls it off and

1810
01:45:20,291 --> 01:45:21,980
stays out of trouble.
Um,

1811
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:26,330
or maybe Anderson Silva has got to the
point where it's really hard to take down

1812
01:45:26,331 --> 01:45:28,150
now it's not,
it's having a hard time taking her down.

1813
01:45:28,151 --> 01:45:29,980
Maybe it takes them down once or twice,

1814
01:45:29,981 --> 01:45:32,170
but it's the third round
and he's having a hard time.

1815
01:45:32,171 --> 01:45:35,110
He's forced to strike with silver
and silver. It takes them apart.

1816
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:40,300
Or we could see Chael Sonnen hurting
Silva standing and then gone right through

1817
01:45:40,301 --> 01:45:44,890
them. Anything could fucking happen. You
just don't know. You know, who knows?

1818
01:45:44,891 --> 01:45:46,480
Maybe sun and takes.

1819
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:51,190
So the down immediately and silver comes
after him with an incredible guard.

1820
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,260
He just,
instead of like being cautious,

1821
01:45:53,261 --> 01:45:56,110
like he wasn't in his last find me through
that triangle up in the fifth round,

1822
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,330
like go after him right away.

1823
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:03,010
We might see that and he might fucking
tap them in a triangle and 30 seconds.

1824
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:07,500
It could, anything could happen. It's who
the fuck knows this Dakota Cochran Dude.

1825
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:08,030
Uh,

1826
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:12,470
he came in as a late replacement against
Jamie Varner and dominated Jamie Varner

1827
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:15,440
and a titan fighting
championships. Guess he, uh,

1828
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:19,240
he went to a decision over him there and
then he lost on the ultimate fighter or

1829
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:22,940
some dude named James Vick. He lost
a victim. Vic, a split decision.

1830
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:25,880
This was his Wikipedia.

1831
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,630
He performed in 16 videos
under the stage name.

1832
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:33,680
Danny fully disclosed this
information to the UFC.

1833
01:46:34,490 --> 01:46:38,660
So the FCC said whatever.
They're probably loving it just for the,

1834
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:42,320
just for the interesting angle, but the
dude can fight, forget about all that.

1835
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:45,980
He can fight his ass off.
Jamie Varner Neb justice

1836
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:46,701
blows up.

1837
01:46:46,701 --> 01:46:50,120
There's going to be getting out of their
sections when Armenian fighter fights,

1838
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,470
there's a section and there all
Armenians, right. You know what I mean?

1839
01:46:52,471 --> 01:46:55,560
There's going to be gay sections
probably. That'd be awesome, dude.

1840
01:46:55,561 --> 01:46:58,800
I think to do it straight though, you
only did it for money. I'll come on.

1841
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:02,970
Well that's, that's what he says,
but for sure he has it for sure.

1842
01:47:02,971 --> 01:47:06,360
He has a big gay following
for sure. For sure. And Dude,

1843
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:08,940
what if they show up in droves?
That'd be awesome.

1844
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,770
Would have gay dudes started
entering into fighting

1845
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:16,740
because he's game might have more anger
than your average to all that shit

1846
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,980
might be a real mind fuck for a
straight dude. Get beat up by a gay guy.

1847
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:24,040
Like that might be a mind fuck.
Like not only does this guy beat my ass,

1848
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:28,000
he could fuck me and he might want
to. Yeah. You know? Yup. Yeah.

1849
01:47:28,001 --> 01:47:30,580
I mean maybe that would have
worked for him. You know,

1850
01:47:30,910 --> 01:47:33,970
for a lot of dudes it probably would
for a lot of dudes, he probably would.

1851
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:38,150
You know, when he gets your back, that's
real. Yeah. There's gotta be a stylus.

1852
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:41,950
There's gotta be a style out
there specifically for anal rape.

1853
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:44,200
You know what I mean?
That's the best Jujitsu for sure.

1854
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:47,420
You'd have to have a base in Jujitsu,
but it'd get technical because you'd,

1855
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:50,770
you'd have to pan the arms a certain way.
Pennants needs a certain way to,

1856
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:54,610
to get penetration. It's totally
different drug to hold them in place.

1857
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:58,090
That would be, but it could
be like a, like cop tactics,

1858
01:47:58,091 --> 01:48:01,620
like police tactics where there's
Jujitsu in there, but they got the baton,

1859
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:04,950
they got something else going on,
they got handcuffed them.

1860
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:07,390
So maybe you don't have
to handcuff him first.

1861
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:12,210
You have to handcuffs upbeat ideas.
That's,

1862
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,060
it seems like a really easiest way,
right

1863
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:20,450
person. Why are you even bring that up?
What a terrible thing to do to a person

1864
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:27,560
that's, that's definitely not using
martial arts for good. Yes, you're right.

1865
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:33,110
I forgot fucked up. I'm sorry.
Have you seen this thing?

1866
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:38,030
I'm going to change gears
completely about, um, these,
um, things that they found,

1867
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,580
these portals and the universe,

1868
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:45,260
he's hidden portals between the earth
and the sun. They're totally confused,

1869
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:50,470
but there some sort of a guide
or a shortcut and there's
an opening in the space

1870
01:48:53,001 --> 01:48:57,980
or time fields. Yeah, yeah. Whoa.
Yeah. Tweet that shit. Yeah,

1871
01:48:57,981 --> 01:49:01,520
it's NASA. It's a NASA funded
researcher and plasma physicist,

1872
01:49:01,521 --> 01:49:04,550
Jack Scooter of the
University of Iowa claims.

1873
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:09,551
He has figured out a way to find them
and they're called x points or electron

1874
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:13,550
diffusion regions. And so
there's, there's, you know,

1875
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:18,500
the idea is that there's pathways and
our galaxy, our galaxy isn't just,

1876
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:22,610
it's not just like, you know, you have
to go from here to there. No, you can,

1877
01:49:22,611 --> 01:49:26,150
you can actually go in this thing
and it might take you somewhere else.

1878
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:30,710
Like, like, like a real wormhole.

1879
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:35,000
You imagine if we find other wormholes
are just like tunnels that just exist all

1880
01:49:35,001 --> 01:49:37,730
over the place and you know how you get,
you know, just drive through the tunnel.

1881
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:38,361
Well,

1882
01:49:38,361 --> 01:49:41,420
you could just go through the wormhole
and that's what you do whip and you're on

1883
01:49:41,421 --> 01:49:42,254
the other side.

1884
01:49:42,550 --> 01:49:44,890
Yeah, man. How about, how about that?

1885
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:48,850
Have you seen a documentary as
the ultimate stoner response and

1886
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:50,710
Morrison did it,
did you ever,

1887
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:54,300
do you know anything about the
Coral Castle in Florida? Yes, I did.

1888
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:57,400
Made some crazy castle.

1889
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,310
Brian pulled this up because I don't
understand the science of it and I'm sure

1890
01:50:00,311 --> 01:50:01,144
I'm butchering it.

1891
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:06,330
It's NASA discovers hidden portals in
space and put that it's on youtube and

1892
01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:07,210
they'll,

1893
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:12,210
it'll explain it like NASA discovers
hidden portals in space and it's on a,

1894
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:18,910
on Youtube, so it'll explain
better what they mean by portals.

1895
01:50:18,911 --> 01:50:22,210
But what I'm, the way I'm saying,
and I'm sure I'm fucking it up,

1896
01:50:22,211 --> 01:50:24,700
and in my rudimentary understanding of it,

1897
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:27,360
it means that you know,

1898
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:32,380
the universe is not just one flat sort of,
it's not, it's not the same everywhere.

1899
01:50:32,381 --> 01:50:34,360
There's a little pathways and shit.
There's a little,

1900
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:37,080
there's things that exist that,
you know,

1901
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:40,720
not just black holes but other things
that will take you through to somewhere

1902
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:44,260
else, which is kind of
nuts. I mean, some day,

1903
01:50:44,290 --> 01:50:48,190
some future generation of ours might be
able to actually traverse something like

1904
01:50:48,191 --> 01:50:51,010
that. You know what I mean? It's really
crazy to wrap your head around that.

1905
01:50:51,011 --> 01:50:54,700
We might figure it out one day how to
navigate through the universe and fucking

1906
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:59,080
go through an actual portal into another
place and it it's hard to wrap your

1907
01:50:59,081 --> 01:51:00,910
head around. Yeah, man.

1908
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:05,530
I mean just basic shit like
the earth magnetic field,

1909
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:08,260
you know, and that there are
certain points on the planet,

1910
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,590
whether there's hyper activity

1911
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:16,430
presented by science at NASA.
That guy sounds like he gets no pussy.

1912
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:21,640
Bedford theme of science fiction is the
portal an extroardinary opening in space

1913
01:51:21,981 --> 01:51:25,220
or time that connects
travelers to distant realms.

1914
01:51:26,150 --> 01:51:28,730
A good portal is a shortcut,
a guide,

1915
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:33,020
a door into the unknown if
only they actually existed.

1916
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,840
It turns out that they do sort of,

1917
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:40,280
and a NASA funded researcher at the
University of Iowa has figured out how to

1918
01:51:40,281 --> 01:51:41,114
find them.

1919
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:46,900
We call them x points or
electron diffusion regions
explains Plasma Physicist

1920
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,430
Jack's gutter of the University of Iowa.

1921
01:51:50,690 --> 01:51:54,650
They're places where the magnetic field
of earth connects to the magnetic field

1922
01:51:54,651 --> 01:51:55,484
of the sun,

1923
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:59,630
creating an uninterrupted path leading
from our own planet to the sun's

1924
01:51:59,631 --> 01:52:01,880
atmosphere.
93 million miles away.

1925
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:07,960
Observations by Nassis Themis spacecraft
and Europe's cluster probes suggest

1926
01:52:07,961 --> 01:52:12,080
that these magnetic portals open
and close dozens of times each day.

1927
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:17,470
They're typically located a few tens of
thousands of kilometers from Earth with

1928
01:52:17,471 --> 01:52:20,540
the geomagnetic field meets
the onrushing solar wind.

1929
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:25,820
Most portals are small and short lived.
Others are yawning.

1930
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:30,620
Vast and sustained energetic particles
can flow through the openings,

1931
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,540
heating Earth's upper atmosphere,

1932
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:37,840
sparking geomagnetic storms and igniting
bright polar Aurora's NASA is planning

1933
01:52:39,351 --> 01:52:40,820
a mission called MMS.

1934
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:46,100
Short form magnetospheric multiscale
mission due to launch in 2014 just study

1935
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:51,491
the phenomenon bristling with energetic
particle detectors and magnetic sensors.

1936
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,300
The force spacecraft of MMS will
spread out in Earth's magnetosphere and

1937
01:52:56,301 --> 01:52:58,400
surround the portals to
observe how they work.

1938
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:02,000
Just one problem finding them.

1939
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:07,280
Magnetic portals are invisible,
unstable, and elusive.

1940
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:12,470
They open and close without warning and
there are no signposts to guide us in

1941
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:17,210
notes. Scutter actually, there are
signposts and Scutter has found them.

1942
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:23,530
Portals form via the process of magnetic
reconnection mingling lines of magnetic

1943
01:53:23,991 --> 01:53:28,280
force from the Sun and Earth Crisscross
Kross and join to create the openings.

1944
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:31,460
X points are where the
crisscross takes place.

1945
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:36,470
The sudden joining of magnetic fields
can propel jets of charged particles from

1946
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:41,471
the x point creating an electron diffusion
region to learn how to pinpoint these

1947
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:42,590
events.

1948
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:46,280
Scutter looked at data from a space probe
that orbited earth more than 10 years

1949
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:47,114
ago.

1950
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:52,640
In the late 1990s NASA's polar spacecraft
spent years in Earth's magnetosphere,

1951
01:53:52,641 --> 01:53:57,641
explained Scutter and it encountered
many x points during its mission because

1952
01:53:57,921 --> 01:54:00,530
polar carried sensors
similar to those of MMS,

1953
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:05,980
Scutter decided to see how an x point
looked to polar using polar data.

1954
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:11,000
We have found five simple combinations
of magnetic field and energetic particle

1955
01:54:11,001 --> 01:54:14,720
measurements that tell us when we've
come across an x point or an electron

1956
01:54:14,721 --> 01:54:15,554
diffusion region,

1957
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:20,720
a single spacecraft properly
instrumented can make these measurements.

1958
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:26,660
This means that a single member of the
MMS constellation using the diagnostics

1959
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:29,990
can find a portal and alert other
members of the constellation,

1960
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:33,890
our mission planners.
Von Thought that MMS might have to,

1961
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:36,570
if you want to hear the whole thing,

1962
01:54:36,571 --> 01:54:41,130
go online and check because I'm sure
most of us are not absorbing that.

1963
01:54:41,131 --> 01:54:44,340
We're going to have to go back
and listen to that and, and, and,

1964
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:47,010
and read the paperwork on it.
But that sounds fucking crazy.

1965
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:50,940
Finding new things like that in
space. It's like weird. It's so weird.

1966
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:53,820
Like the idea that we already
figured out what was out there up,

1967
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:58,260
there's some new shit. Oh,
here's some, here's some
invisible magnetic portal. OOPS,

1968
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:01,110
here's some new shit.
Did you hear about this?

1969
01:55:01,111 --> 01:55:05,520
A new civilization they
discovered that lived, uh, 8,000,

1970
01:55:05,521 --> 01:55:10,350
500 years ago, uh, somewhere near Spain.
They found an underwater, they have,

1971
01:55:10,351 --> 01:55:12,810
um, like pottery, all kinds of shit.

1972
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:17,700
Apparently this area used to be,
um, used to be above ground, like,

1973
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,090
uh, between, uh,

1974
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:23,100
and somewhere between
11,000 and 6,000 years ago,

1975
01:55:23,101 --> 01:55:25,860
it's slowly sank away and they,
uh,

1976
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:28,650
they've recovered like
human bones and pottery.

1977
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:33,920
It seems like every other month there's
some new groundbreaking discovery that

1978
01:55:34,531 --> 01:55:38,400
pushes back the date of
civilization. It's amazing. You know,

1979
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:43,500
this go Beckley Tampa Bay was like the
first big one and now they're always in

1980
01:55:43,501 --> 01:55:46,290
like they found these
concentric rings in the,

1981
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:48,960
in the ocean floor that
they believe is Atlantis.

1982
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:52,230
And I think that's somewhere around
Spain and how there's, there's,

1983
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:57,260
there's all sorts of speculation that
there might have been a fuck load of

1984
01:55:57,450 --> 01:56:00,120
civilizations that were like really,
you know,

1985
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:04,020
pretty advanced for the time and we were
living right by the water and they're

1986
01:56:04,021 --> 01:56:05,610
gone now the water level changed.

1987
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:10,090
What do you think about that Baltic Sea
to sponsor? There is just a rock crusher.

1988
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:12,450
It's Iraq if you look into it.
Yeah,

1989
01:56:12,451 --> 01:56:15,990
I haven't seen any photos that make me
think it's anything other than weird

1990
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:16,770
rocks,

1991
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:19,680
rocks or whatever's going down there and
trying to fuck with it and then turned

1992
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:23,850
power shuts off twice. Yeah, it could
be their equipment sucks at high depth.

1993
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:27,360
You know, it could be the pressure
of the equipment, equipment failed.

1994
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:30,810
Sometimes people look for Shit
to be like something crafting.

1995
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:32,760
I would love it if it
was something crafty,

1996
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:36,810
but I saw the pictures of me like that
shit looks like rocks man. They're like,

1997
01:56:36,811 --> 01:56:39,630
well there's a pearl necklace.
It's like scattered rocks.

1998
01:56:39,631 --> 01:56:42,210
Like you guys are like reaching
like this is just rocks. I mean,

1999
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:44,400
maybe when you're down there
looking at it eye to eye,

2000
01:56:44,401 --> 01:56:47,340
it looks different and maybe there's
some shit that they haven't been able to

2001
01:56:47,341 --> 01:56:50,490
photograph yet. The ones you see,
you'd go, oh, whoa, whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

2002
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:54,840
this is a fucking, somebody made
this. Maybe it's possible. But, um,

2003
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:55,890
most,

2004
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:59,160
most of the time I think there's plenty
of shit out there that they could be

2005
01:56:59,161 --> 01:57:03,990
looking at are faking their enthusiasm.
They're like way,

2006
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:08,730
no, they're enthusiastic. It
doesn't mean, you know, I dunno.

2007
01:57:09,150 --> 01:57:11,820
I Dunno. I Dunno if they're,
they're looking to see something.

2008
01:57:11,821 --> 01:57:14,700
I don't know if what they can actually
see as much cooler than the shit they've

2009
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:16,830
shown us.
The shit that they've shown us is like,

2010
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:19,610
you see like this big rock and I don't
know why we're supposed to think that's

2011
01:57:19,611 --> 01:57:24,030
special, you know? But why rock
sometimes forming weird forms.

2012
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:29,010
You know, Graham Hancock said it's
just a rock. That's what his real,

2013
01:57:29,011 --> 01:57:32,010
his assessment of it was
because a peculiarly or rock,

2014
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:35,130
that's what he believes it is. But you
know, this is just the beginning of data.

2015
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:37,890
No one knows. But the people who were
down there staring at it, you know,

2016
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,000
it might be aliens vs Predator fucking
temple and we just a cocky civilization

2017
01:57:45,211 --> 01:57:49,650
that used to be above water.
It could be, yeah. Yeah.

2018
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:52,650
I mean how much would
be left of something?

2019
01:57:52,651 --> 01:57:55,620
It was underwater for 30,000
years under the ocean.

2020
01:57:55,650 --> 01:57:56,790
How much of that chickens jam?

2021
01:57:56,830 --> 01:58:01,200
It's like part of some Russian experiment
or something. Yeah. Maybe it's a troll.

2022
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:02,213
Two big troller.

2023
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,170
No, no, no. I mean like uh,

2024
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:08,420
some vessel that the Russians were
fucking with like 30 years ago and, right,

2025
01:58:08,421 --> 01:58:08,570
right.

2026
01:58:08,570 --> 01:58:11,630
I don't think so. I think they're saying
it's a stone. It's a stone structure,

2027
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,970
whatever it is, natural
structure, whatever it is.

2028
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,530
I believe they're saying it's stolen.

2029
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:19,070
I think there's just some quick Yuliar
like pathways in it and stuff like that.

2030
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:21,020
Just put,
it could be just some weird ass dog

2031
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,020
that into it.

2032
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:28,430
I just saw at like maybe a five minute
news clip on the latest dive and they

2033
01:58:28,441 --> 01:58:32,400
said they went down to power. All the
power goes off. Then they went back.

2034
01:58:32,401 --> 01:58:35,400
Sounds awesome. I was going to write
a script. That's what I would write.

2035
01:58:35,401 --> 01:58:39,330
If it was like one of the guys was the
biggest skeptic papa bought. Now he's he,

2036
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,400
he can't explain it. He doesn't, he
doesn't want to make a statement,

2037
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,620
but he's saying this is not normal.

2038
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:48,070
What is the latest one was the last time
it was a news report. Yeah, look at it.

2039
01:58:48,450 --> 01:58:53,320
That's this Baltic Ufo news report.
Yeah.

2040
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:57,820
What's interesting is it's so
sexy to want to want to think.

2041
01:58:57,870 --> 01:59:01,240
This is from some other planet.
You know? It's so intriguing.

2042
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:06,490
If we really imagine if we really found
a fucking ship at the bottom of the

2043
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:11,140
ocean and it was just dressed up like a
rock, because that's what you would do.

2044
01:59:11,141 --> 01:59:13,630
If you want it to hide your ship,
you make it look like a fucking rock.

2045
01:59:13,631 --> 01:59:14,560
I mean they're aliens.

2046
01:59:14,561 --> 01:59:17,650
They can come here from another
planet and it has to look like a ship.

2047
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:18,790
It's so stupid.

2048
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:23,020
Maybe they made a fucking alien
spacecraft that looks like rocks,

2049
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:26,110
so when it's on the bottom,
it's just chilling like a rock.

2050
01:59:26,111 --> 01:59:28,990
Of course they should be able to alter
their environment or the way they're,

2051
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:32,770
they look to their environment. So maybe
that's what it is. I would love that.

2052
01:59:32,771 --> 01:59:34,660
That's the best thing.
That would be the most,

2053
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:39,430
the most fun new story that would
change the world. But I'm not convinced.

2054
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:44,620
New dive details. Photos. See
this look for the new story.

2055
01:59:45,450 --> 01:59:50,320
Yeah. There's some photos that uh,
Brian, can you find it to show the rocks?

2056
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:55,640
Well, it's like a BBC thing maybe.
Yeah. I mean it shows it's, it's,

2057
01:59:55,641 --> 01:59:58,240
it's interesting man. It's so, you
know, hopefully it's something,

2058
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:59,830
but it might be bullshit.

2059
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,520
It might totally be a natural thing
telling me their equipment might suck.

2060
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:07,750
Who knows? But like I said, it's
sexy to think that it's not,

2061
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,340
the whole idea of Ufo was the sexiest Yo,

2062
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:13,720
this the sexiest idea that there's
actually going to be something you would

2063
02:00:13,721 --> 02:00:17,230
forget your bills.
Forget what the fuck is on TV.

2064
02:00:17,231 --> 02:00:20,860
Even if it was like the final season
premiere of the game of Thrones, you know?

2065
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:25,850
Yeah. In the last days in first episode,
you know, final season premier league,

2066
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:28,990
uh, still dude take seeing a Ufo. Remember

2067
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,900
if I remember correctly,

2068
02:00:31,901 --> 02:00:35,050
and I could be wrong about
David Eick like in his,

2069
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:39,550
in the beginning of his career as being
like a dude who lectures on Illuminati

2070
02:00:39,551 --> 02:00:43,510
type stuff. He said some
shit about reptilians and
then a lot of people turned,

2071
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:47,320
uh, that turned them off. They're like,
Fuck David. I cause that Reptilian Guy,

2072
02:00:47,321 --> 02:00:49,150
he loses me when he
talks about reptilians.

2073
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:53,200
So then it seemed like he stopped
talking about Reptilians for awhile,

2074
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:58,680
but recently I just saw this seminar
he did and he gets in depth about rope

2075
02:00:59,111 --> 02:00:59,500
tows.

2076
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:04,500
He says that all the world
leaders have are being controlled.

2077
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:09,410
Does David Ike I just saw this last week
are being controlled by Reptilians that

2078
02:01:09,411 --> 02:01:12,280
are on a different frequency and there
are around them controlling them.

2079
02:01:12,281 --> 02:01:13,420
You just can't see them.

2080
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:18,430
They're actually controlling the
world leaders. That's what he thinks.

2081
02:01:18,431 --> 02:01:21,400
And he's talking about this in
his lecture. That's amazing.

2082
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,400
Amazing that he can do this. Yeah. Um, I
think, uh, I think he's an entertainer.

2083
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:30,050
That's what I think part of what he
does is he's an entertainer. Yeah.

2084
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:34,500
I think he's a, he's a lot like, uh,
there's a few other guys that I don't,

2085
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:36,630
I don't buy a for a second.
He's one of them.

2086
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:39,210
I think he's got some really good valid

2087
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:43,160
that he mixes in with some
crazy shit and he creates,

2088
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:47,720
he creates like a whole cottage industry.
That's what I think. Alex Jones,

2089
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:52,340
Alex Jones was totally against David
Eick for a while because of the reptilian

2090
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,320
thing.
It totally against them.

2091
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:58,700
And then he actually became friends with
David Eick and he doesn't really want

2092
02:01:58,701 --> 02:02:00,380
to get into it.
He says,

2093
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:05,590
he says that the reptilian thing makes
more sense to them now and they're cool

2094
02:02:06,021 --> 02:02:09,170
now. They hated each other. They said,
talk shit on and shuttle. You know?

2095
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:13,610
Now they're cool. They've been cool for a
though, you know Jones is a big sweetie.

2096
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:18,230
Yeah. That's the reality. The reality is
Alex Jones is always a big sweetie. Yeah.

2097
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:22,460
He's one of the cool, clearly as fuckers,
I hang out with a really nice guy.

2098
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:23,990
You know,
people would never believe it.

2099
02:02:23,991 --> 02:02:28,991
If you watch his doom and gloom and how
crazy is it that we've partied with him

2100
02:02:29,631 --> 02:02:33,520
in Vegas and got hammered with a
hammer and had a great time with him.

2101
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:36,500
He's an awesome guy and
he is not a bad dude man.

2102
02:02:36,501 --> 02:02:39,830
He just gets all worked
up and he loves talking.

2103
02:02:39,831 --> 02:02:44,831
You know even when the cameras are off
he can talk all that conspiracy talk non

2104
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:49,430
stop non 24 hours and you're never
gets tired of it. I love hearing it.

2105
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:54,380
I got Alex Jones sitting next to
me at Wolf Gang. Puck Illuminati,

2106
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:59,890
the situation he was brought in by
Kennedy in the sixties 1961 operation.

2107
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:03,613
Thundercat.

2108
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:07,820
He'll come up with fucking hit you
with some shit and you're like what?

2109
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,290
But a lot of what he's saying is right.
I love Alex Jones, man. I love his shit.

2110
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:15,380
You can't be right all the time.
Everyone's wrong.

2111
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,090
And sometimes he's wrong about shit.

2112
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:21,740
You don't discount all the fucking
beautiful info that he has after it.

2113
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:24,250
Yeah, he's going to miss
a lot. You know, you know,

2114
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:27,320
if you're going to judge someone on being
wrong about this or that cause he was

2115
02:03:27,321 --> 02:03:32,210
wrong about y two k you can't there,
everyone's wrong about some shit.

2116
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:35,360
You can't be right about everything.
Well, it's the doom and gloom guys.

2117
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:38,050
There's a certain amount of
entertainment to it. You got it.

2118
02:03:38,051 --> 02:03:41,690
You got to recognize that much like
Fox News has committed itself to being

2119
02:03:41,691 --> 02:03:43,010
conservative.
You know,

2120
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:46,460
he has committed himself to a doom
and gloom and to a certain extent,

2121
02:03:46,461 --> 02:03:49,740
that's the problem that I had with
Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Murdoch,

2122
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:53,540
let them know Michael Rupert,
when Michael Gruber was,

2123
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:57,290
was on the show and he would alternate
between thinking that it was going to be

2124
02:03:57,291 --> 02:03:59,990
the end of the world or thinking that
people were going to pull it together.

2125
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:05,290
And I think that you can get caught
up in thinking that it's going to,

2126
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,760
everything's going to fucking fall apart.
You can get caught up in that.

2127
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,480
It's really easy. It's really easy to
just a side. It's all coming to an end.

2128
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:16,330
It's so easy to do, you
know? And I think, uh,

2129
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:21,260
you get caught up in that the whole
world is corrupt and this doom and gloom

2130
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:22,270
everywhere and you,

2131
02:04:22,271 --> 02:04:27,140
you caught up in that whole Alex Jones
conspiracy mentality and well a lot of

2132
02:04:27,141 --> 02:04:30,080
it's fucking real man. It's
true. We don't live in,

2133
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:33,320
we don't live in a society where the
government is all about the people.

2134
02:04:33,321 --> 02:04:34,940
We don't whether you want
to believe it or not.

2135
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:37,980
The way I look at it is I'm
not going go out there and pick

2136
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,660
it shit. You know, who knows.

2137
02:04:39,661 --> 02:04:42,690
Maybe I'll change my mind a bit effects
if something happens that affects me

2138
02:04:42,691 --> 02:04:44,220
personally.
Maybe I'll be out there with a picket,

2139
02:04:44,221 --> 02:04:49,221
but one thing we can all do is we can
all use Twitter or Facebook just to make

2140
02:04:50,341 --> 02:04:50,911
people aware.

2141
02:04:50,911 --> 02:04:55,380
I think everybody is aware and that's
just from Twitter and from Facebook.

2142
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:59,240
If they're aware of what's going
on, I think slowly we change. Yeah.

2143
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:02,920
Because I really think
that, you know, there's,

2144
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:06,270
there is light at the end of the tunnel
from all these conspiracy theories and

2145
02:05:06,271 --> 02:05:11,130
all that shit. I think that there is
hope that if the everybody was aware,

2146
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:13,890
and today more than anybody,
any other time in history,

2147
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:18,000
more people are aware that the government
is fucking them than ever before

2148
02:05:18,001 --> 02:05:22,170
because of the Internet. So I just think,
let's just keep making people aware.

2149
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:25,260
Just keep pounding them over the head
with the information. Look at the studies,

2150
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:28,590
look at this, look what they're
doing. And if we have it,

2151
02:05:28,591 --> 02:05:33,210
some people just do not want to believe
that the government doesn't have our

2152
02:05:33,211 --> 02:05:36,150
best interest. You know, they don't
want to believe that they get angry.

2153
02:05:36,151 --> 02:05:38,850
If you bring it up there, you don't have
any proof. That's not proof. You know,

2154
02:05:38,851 --> 02:05:43,851
there's 1500 engineers and
architects that are banded together.

2155
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:48,630
They've, they've gone out of their
way banning together saying, dude,

2156
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:53,490
Tyler seven was demoed. I
mean, the banding together
and what people say, you know,

2157
02:05:53,491 --> 02:05:56,610
how many architects there are,
there's fucking hundreds of thousands,

2158
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:59,430
so 1500 got together.
You know what I mean?

2159
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:04,110
If 1500 architects got together
and petitioned and said,

2160
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:08,340
this house is condemned, it's going to
fall apart. It's dangerous. Would you say?

2161
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,330
Uh, it's only 1500 architects.
There's 100,000 of them. No, you'd go,

2162
02:06:13,331 --> 02:06:16,000
you'd wait a minute. I'm not moving
into that motherfucker. That's it.

2163
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:19,780
So kind of an unfair comparison because
you're talking about a public event and

2164
02:06:19,781 --> 02:06:23,470
when you talk about a public event of the
entire world saw this one public event,

2165
02:06:23,650 --> 02:06:27,490
so you're dealing with millions and
millions and millions and millions of

2166
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:31,330
millions of people to get 1500 that
think there's something going on like a

2167
02:06:31,331 --> 02:06:35,350
Texan engineers. I'm just saying
1500 crazy people is not unlikely.

2168
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:39,760
I agree. Obviously I've always agreed.
Is something wrong with that, that thing,

2169
02:06:39,761 --> 02:06:42,010
it fell down like a controlled demolition.
It's weird.

2170
02:06:42,190 --> 02:06:43,780
It's weird that that
doesn't freak people out.

2171
02:06:43,781 --> 02:06:47,470
And it's weird that you can't sue the
fuck out of someone who built a building

2172
02:06:47,471 --> 02:06:48,910
for you and it catches on fire.

2173
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,140
Just fucking kill the houses.

2174
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:55,440
The former head of star wars is coming
out making some serious allegations.

2175
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:02,230
The dig chick, former head of
star wars, is he a scientist?

2176
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:03,910
He's a bunch of show.

2177
02:07:04,270 --> 02:07:09,100
He's coming out and saying that prop
based on the evidence based on all the

2178
02:07:09,101 --> 02:07:11,320
Shitty knows about, uh, nine 11,

2179
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:15,490
based on all that shit he thinks it
looks like it's probably Dick Cheney was

2180
02:07:15,491 --> 02:07:19,120
running all this shit. Wow. He's, that's
what he's saying. He said Dick Cheney

2181
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:23,500
and he shot first forehead of the Star
Wars Program says Cheney may nine, 11,

2182
02:07:23,501 --> 02:07:25,840
suspect official version of events.

2183
02:07:25,841 --> 02:07:30,130
A conspiracy theory says drills
were to cover for attacks.

2184
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:33,370
The drills were covered for attacks.

2185
02:07:33,580 --> 02:07:37,060
The former head of star wars missile
defense under presidents Ford and Carter

2186
02:07:37,061 --> 02:07:39,700
has gone public to say that the official
version of the nine 11 conspiracy,

2187
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:44,350
it's a conspiracy theory and his main
suspect for the architect of the attacks

2188
02:07:44,351 --> 02:07:49,210
is Vice President Dick
Cheney. Whoa. That's fucking
shit. You get murdered over.

2189
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:49,840
Wow.

2190
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:54,640
People get murdered for way less because
it is funny though that people don't

2191
02:07:54,641 --> 02:07:56,210
want to hear that.
It is funny that Pete,

2192
02:07:56,240 --> 02:08:00,260
this is something the anger people read
about his background. Is He legit? Oh yes.

2193
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:03,010
It's a legit guy. Yeah, he's 100%
legit. He was the head of Star Wars.

2194
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:04,810
Star Wars is a very interesting program,

2195
02:08:04,811 --> 02:08:06,550
and I think we've talked about
this on the podcast before,

2196
02:08:06,551 --> 02:08:10,250
but star wars scientists
have been murdered like a,

2197
02:08:10,251 --> 02:08:11,620
a great number of them.

2198
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:15,600
Yeah. Yeah. I mean here, here we go,
conspiracy guys to deny the nine 11 shit.

2199
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:19,650
The head of Star Wars is
saying it was all bullshit.

2200
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:24,810
That kid a fucking star wars. God Damn,
and you're still going to deny it.

2201
02:08:24,890 --> 02:08:26,680
Well, there's so much evidence, right?

2202
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,370
But in all fairness,

2203
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:32,000
he's a scientist and he could
be some crazy left winger.

2204
02:08:32,001 --> 02:08:34,910
And just because he's a genius
scientist doesn't mean he's not.

2205
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:37,850
Yeah, but where people always
talk about credibility, if they,

2206
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:41,000
if they would say if some, if they, if
there was some guy on the street and said,

2207
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:44,580
I saw bombs. I heard bombs go off. They
call. He's just some dude on the street.

2208
02:08:44,730 --> 02:08:47,850
Now we've got former head of star wars
that he could be crazy. You can't just,

2209
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:51,750
at some point you got to go, God
dammit. At some point you got to go.

2210
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:54,480
Of course it's fishy.

2211
02:08:54,690 --> 02:08:57,780
Of course there's people banning together.

2212
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:02,240
22 star wars researchers,
all committed suicide,

2213
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:07,840
22 all committed to this. Yeah, of
course. Nice. Amazing. Well there's, I'll,

2214
02:09:07,850 --> 02:09:10,790
I'll deal with the, you
know, the, the thing was,

2215
02:09:10,791 --> 02:09:15,650
the idea was the conspiracy theory was
that the star wars program was bullshit

2216
02:09:15,670 --> 02:09:16,790
and it was never worked.

2217
02:09:16,791 --> 02:09:21,020
And they never had some real missile
defense shield that they get shoot and

2218
02:09:21,021 --> 02:09:24,290
space knock fucking missiles
out of the sky or staples.

2219
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:26,510
They never developed
that level of technology.

2220
02:09:26,511 --> 02:09:30,320
So they had sort of hide the fact
that it was a big giant money grab.

2221
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:31,670
They tried to look into it,

2222
02:09:31,671 --> 02:09:35,000
Congress approved that whoever the fuck
approved did they look into it and then

2223
02:09:35,001 --> 02:09:36,530
it just started stealing money.

2224
02:09:36,710 --> 02:09:40,130
So all these scientists that were involved
in this, that knew it was horse shit.

2225
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:44,030
They just knock them all off. That's the
kind of money that you're dealing with.

2226
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:48,260
You're dealing with the kind of money
that can kill 22 researchers, allegedly,

2227
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:52,320
allegedly. Yeah. Sounds
about right. Right. Crazy.

2228
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:56,750
Totally believable. The, I'm the witnesses
of the Kennedy assassination. This is a,

2229
02:09:56,751 --> 02:10:01,190
a new, uh, video that, uh, what is
his nickname on youtube? Mr Brick?

2230
02:10:01,191 --> 02:10:03,890
Maker 37 is uh,
he's uh,

2231
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:07,910
the Tangerine show or Tangerine
show rather on Twitter.

2232
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:12,410
He made this video and in the video he
talked about it was a clip of us on the

2233
02:10:12,411 --> 02:10:16,970
podcast talking about the witnesses to
the Kennedy assassination and how many

2234
02:10:16,971 --> 02:10:21,410
witnesses died. Uh, because of their,
they were murdered car accidents,

2235
02:10:21,411 --> 02:10:24,290
electrocution suicide got hit by trains.

2236
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:28,910
Like crazy amount of them died
in a documentary about this.

2237
02:10:29,210 --> 02:10:33,020
And then they sent the,
uh, they did their,

2238
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,250
their calculation

2239
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:37,430
was that the odds of all of these
people who had witnessed this one event

2240
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:41,330
getting murdered or were
killed in accidents in such
a short period of time was

2241
02:10:41,331 --> 02:10:44,720
one in something trillion to one.
Yeah,

2242
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:50,270
that shit over as one point.
Something over and over again.

2243
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:53,960
All that shit.
People don't want to guys are paranoid.

2244
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:58,700
I'm proud. It's, it's a sexy idea.
But Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

2245
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,980
They've already proven you
could shoot that rifle.

2246
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:04,010
There's that certain sort of delusional,

2247
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:09,160
conservative sort of Patriot type radio
guide voice that they do where you're

2248
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:14,060
talking nonsense. They've uh,
they've all filled out the dossier.

2249
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:18,770
It's all completed. Sorry.
Sorry. Hippies. Sorry. Okay.

2250
02:11:18,771 --> 02:11:23,210
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
Thank you. That's scary shit man.

2251
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:27,400
But these are like in mindset and
they want to lock into an ideology.

2252
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:33,640
We figure out how much evidence would
it take to take like the biggest,

2253
02:11:34,770 --> 02:11:39,320
uh, debunker dude take it. How
much evidence will it take?

2254
02:11:39,321 --> 02:11:40,700
Will it if they,

2255
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:44,860
if like Dick Cheney came out
and admitted it when they,

2256
02:11:45,290 --> 02:11:48,140
they've got no Dick Cheney,
he lost his mind with that new heart.

2257
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:52,520
A new arts are liars. Hearts. Yes,
exactly. People would believe that shit.

2258
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:54,530
Of course it would. A lot
of people would. Well,

2259
02:11:54,531 --> 02:11:56,510
there's a lot of people that want
to believe that the governments,

2260
02:11:56,511 --> 02:11:59,240
their daddy government's gonna
take care of them, I think.

2261
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:04,010
I think if everyone consciously tried
to make all their friends aware of the

2262
02:12:04,011 --> 02:12:08,930
truth, look into it. People are
constantly looking, doing I cabi Vasquez,

2263
02:12:08,931 --> 02:12:09,830
I was with him last week.

2264
02:12:09,831 --> 02:12:14,831
We were in El Paso doing a Gracie
nationals tournament and he just recently

2265
02:12:15,861 --> 02:12:19,650
started looking into conspiracy
theories and it's like changed his, uh,

2266
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:24,060
he kept going on and on and
how it's changed his life
and his wages and you just

2267
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:27,470
actually got to look into it, you
know? Well, people can spire. I mean,

2268
02:12:27,471 --> 02:12:30,200
if people don't believe that, this
is my question, that I always say,

2269
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:33,920
do you believe in nine 11? Do you believe
nine 11 happened? Well, if you do,

2270
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:38,810
that's a conspiracy isn't, it?
Isn't a conspiracy, didn't they?

2271
02:12:38,811 --> 02:12:40,880
These guys can spire to make that happen.

2272
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:43,700
Do you believe that the
Japanese attacked World War II?

2273
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:44,960
They attacked to a Pearl Harbor?

2274
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:49,370
Well then you believe in conspiracy
theories because the Japanese conspired to

2275
02:12:49,371 --> 02:12:53,580
sneak attack with jets and bomb the fuck
out of people. That's real. Like they,

2276
02:12:53,581 --> 02:12:55,340
they really plan that out,
you know?

2277
02:12:55,341 --> 02:12:57,460
Do you believe that Hitler
burned the right stack to,

2278
02:12:57,530 --> 02:13:00,560
to get people to think that the, you
know, that the Nazis were under attack?

2279
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:03,530
Do you believe that Nero burned Rome?
Do you believe in any of these crazy?

2280
02:13:03,531 --> 02:13:05,720
We then you believe in
conspiracies, man, they,

2281
02:13:05,721 --> 02:13:07,550
they're documented throughout history.

2282
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:12,200
People have been conspiring it bullshit
and forever men, they've always done it.

2283
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:14,960
They always will if they can
get away with it to pull it off.

2284
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:17,720
A bunch of evil fucks work together.
They know each other real well.

2285
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:20,690
They partied together, they kill hookers
together and they get together and go,

2286
02:13:20,691 --> 02:13:22,820
you know what? Why are we fucking
playing by the rules here?

2287
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,100
Well let's just rob these pitches.
Let's rob these bitches.

2288
02:13:25,101 --> 02:13:28,660
And they lost touch knuckles and
they go after it and they, they,

2289
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:32,070
they pay money to get
lobbyists to change laws to

2290
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,460
make it easier for them to fucking
move money around and they just,

2291
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:39,480
they keep that party rolling and they
leave so much evidence land around.

2292
02:13:39,490 --> 02:13:42,150
It doesn't matter. It doesn't pass
it matter. Well in this day and age,

2293
02:13:42,151 --> 02:13:43,170
I think it started a matter.

2294
02:13:43,171 --> 02:13:46,440
I think what's going on now with the
Internet is that young people coming up

2295
02:13:46,441 --> 02:13:49,230
with the,
a realization of how the system works.

2296
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:52,830
A realization of just human life
in general. When I say the system,

2297
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:56,910
a realization of countries and taking
other other countries' resources in the

2298
02:13:56,911 --> 02:13:59,370
hall,
it's the people that are coming up.

2299
02:13:59,371 --> 02:14:03,330
It's going to be way harder for the
children of the people that live today to

2300
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:07,890
justify the way the world runs in the
future because all this information will

2301
02:14:07,891 --> 02:14:10,290
be out there.
Whereas when we were kids,

2302
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:13,590
when I was growing up in
the 1970s there was no,

2303
02:14:13,650 --> 02:14:15,720
there was no information
about any of this.

2304
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:18,990
We never had any idea how the fucking
world war and he had to go to a library.

2305
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:22,140
If you wanted to get information and
you had to find the right book and who

2306
02:14:22,141 --> 02:14:24,880
knows what that book is even right.
You could even fact check it. You know?

2307
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:27,120
It was difficult to find out
what the fuck was going on,

2308
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:31,080
but now pretty much anybody with a phone
has instant access to almost any answer

2309
02:14:31,081 --> 02:14:34,530
to any question they have or
at least reasonable, you know,

2310
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:37,770
to a reasonable extent. That's
going to change everything, man.

2311
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:40,710
I think we're just seeing it right now.
We're the beginning of the wave.

2312
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:44,280
I think the wave behind us is
the wave that can't be ignored.

2313
02:14:44,281 --> 02:14:46,980
There's going to be a group of
people that know everything.

2314
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:48,960
They have all the information.

2315
02:14:48,990 --> 02:14:53,400
It's not like your regular person that
lived in the 1970s that went to school

2316
02:14:53,401 --> 02:14:55,800
for a certain thing and then
live in a certain neighborhood.

2317
02:14:56,130 --> 02:15:00,210
Now you're going to be influenced by all
the humans all over the planet all the

2318
02:15:00,211 --> 02:15:02,730
time and that's what's going
on right now with Twitter.

2319
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:04,980
That's what's going on right
now with this fucking podcast.

2320
02:15:04,981 --> 02:15:06,750
That's what's going on
right now with Facebook.

2321
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:11,780
That's what's going on right now with
anybody that starts their own podcasts and

2322
02:15:12,130 --> 02:15:15,300
anybody who starts their own message
board and anybody that starts their own

2323
02:15:15,301 --> 02:15:18,060
thing where they're reaching out and
communicating with people and other people

2324
02:15:18,061 --> 02:15:19,380
lock into it and next thing you know,

2325
02:15:19,381 --> 02:15:22,140
you got your own little
online party going on, man.

2326
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:27,330
You got your own little online party
going on. That's never existed.

2327
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:32,360
No one has ever had that sort of an
openness in the past before to open access

2328
02:15:32,641 --> 02:15:34,230
to information in the past before,

2329
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:36,960
we've never been able to just
communicate with people like this.

2330
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,170
So we're going to get to know each other
more in the next hundred years than we

2331
02:15:40,171 --> 02:15:41,670
have in the last million years.

2332
02:15:42,030 --> 02:15:44,880
We're going to get to know
how we handle the real,

2333
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:47,400
raw fucking truth of everything.
Because in the wild,

2334
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:51,240
there's going to be no more secrets.
You're not gonna be able to hide money.

2335
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:55,230
You're not going to be able to hide
where resources are coming from.

2336
02:15:55,231 --> 02:15:56,280
You're not to be able to hide anything.

2337
02:15:56,281 --> 02:15:58,530
Everybody's going to know exactly
what's going on all the time,

2338
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,640
and that's when we're going to have to
either get our shit together as a species

2339
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:07,290
or start using these fucking bombs we've
been storing up. It's one or the other

2340
02:16:10,370 --> 02:16:11,660
when they see guys like Brian.

2341
02:16:13,790 --> 02:16:14,260
Yeah,

2342
02:16:14,260 --> 02:16:18,810
they see this as part of the problem.
When we were talking about, I dunno,

2343
02:16:19,830 --> 02:16:24,350
I'm talking about a bad guys going
after you to protect freedom. Freedom.

2344
02:16:25,410 --> 02:16:27,360
Are you worried about terrorist attacks?
You ever think about it?

2345
02:16:27,630 --> 02:16:30,010
Anything can happen, Bro.
Shit, they already, of

2346
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:33,680
course. Yeah. I mean, anything
could happen if they do it. Really?

2347
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:37,180
Or did it go down as the
head of Star Wars says,

2348
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:41,800
and there's a fucking Dick Cheney
who knows exactly how it went down.

2349
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:44,860
Add that to the checklist. I thought
I shut it off. I swear to God.

2350
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:47,330
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been doing
so many shows to the other studio.

2351
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:51,670
I'm more concerned about bad
Sushi than I am about terrorism.

2352
02:16:53,900 --> 02:16:57,110
I had bad Sushi and I ruined my day,
my fucking weak.

2353
02:16:57,620 --> 02:17:00,560
But I think about that more than
I think about like, oh no, my,

2354
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:03,450
this plane's going to go
down, you know, or, um,

2355
02:17:03,770 --> 02:17:07,310
I don't think people worry about it.
It's going to happen to them personally,

2356
02:17:07,311 --> 02:17:11,930
the odds, but another terrorist attack
for sure. It's going to keep happening.

2357
02:17:12,170 --> 02:17:15,860
Unless Bryce listeners to just shelter
world. I'm worried about boots. Sue.

2358
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:20,920
She's so silly and everybody gets food
poisoning ever again. That ain't shit.

2359
02:17:20,921 --> 02:17:24,310
I'm scared. People in Iraq eat
food poisoning for breakfast. Okay.

2360
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:29,330
That's what I have for
breakfast every day. Do, man,

2361
02:17:29,331 --> 02:17:32,060
you're lucky. You're lucky. You live here
in America. You've got to roll the dice.

2362
02:17:32,061 --> 02:17:35,670
He not living in fucking taboo.
You know, living in Pakistan,

2363
02:17:36,470 --> 02:17:39,470
launching missiles from
the sky with drones.

2364
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:43,230
See Florida says that they're going to
have the most drones out of any, every,

2365
02:17:43,250 --> 02:17:46,490
any state because was just crazy.
Is it that that's a reality.

2366
02:17:47,390 --> 02:17:49,650
It's a weird word. Was going to do. Again,

2367
02:17:49,670 --> 02:17:51,800
what are they going to keep
track out things, photograph.

2368
02:17:51,801 --> 02:17:54,560
Things are going to be in the,
in the sky in case we ever need them.

2369
02:17:54,770 --> 02:17:58,040
Like say if there's some sort of a high
speed pursuit that drones will be able

2370
02:17:58,041 --> 02:18:01,460
to follow you from the sky and for
sure drones are going to be above you.

2371
02:18:01,461 --> 02:18:04,690
If you plan on doing any speeding,
go kiss that shake of it.

2372
02:18:04,730 --> 02:18:07,650
There's no more speeding because there's
going to be drones that are going to

2373
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:11,900
monitor your speed and then they get an
alert the police to where you are and

2374
02:18:11,901 --> 02:18:13,310
the police are going to cut you off.

2375
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:16,170
I can't wait till people start hacking
these. The good, you know that's,

2376
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:19,490
it's going to happen. Well, that's
what happened. And I ran, you know,

2377
02:18:19,850 --> 02:18:23,780
pack it in Texas. Yeah. They can hack
a man. It's, it's a real problem.

2378
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:25,880
It's going to be a real,
it's a radio frequency man.

2379
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,240
Some super genius due to smarter than
you who wouldn't be working for the

2380
02:18:29,241 --> 02:18:31,790
government is going to figure out
a way to fuck with that shit. Yeah.

2381
02:18:31,791 --> 02:18:35,480
There's Jones be acting a fool any like
just a day after they released those

2382
02:18:35,481 --> 02:18:38,300
things. Yeah. I wonder
how crackable they are,

2383
02:18:38,301 --> 02:18:40,360
but I've got to assume
that anything that's uh,

2384
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:44,270
using radio frequency is you
gotta be able to crack that.

2385
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:45,710
They're going to figure out how the would,

2386
02:18:45,711 --> 02:18:48,980
the frequency one is going to fall on
a child and that it's just going to be,

2387
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:51,910
well it already has in Pakistan,
if, you know, if you're in a,

2388
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:52,820
if you're in Pakistan,

2389
02:18:52,821 --> 02:18:55,340
you're walking with your kid is no
guarantee that you're not going to get hit

2390
02:18:55,341 --> 02:18:57,350
with a missile. You know,
that's, that's real. You know,

2391
02:18:57,351 --> 02:19:00,740
they're fucking firing missiles from
the sky and we're not even like really

2392
02:19:00,741 --> 02:19:02,840
officially over there,
cause we're not over.

2393
02:19:02,841 --> 02:19:07,841
There are robots were over there shooting
fire from the sky like fucking hell

2394
02:19:08,181 --> 02:19:11,840
man. It's amazing where we are.
Terminators happening for them.

2395
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:14,420
When you were a kid,
you remember watching terminator,

2396
02:19:14,421 --> 02:19:17,250
you imagine watching that was it.
Which one was one where they uh,

2397
02:19:17,251 --> 02:19:19,490
the things were flying in the
air and they were shooting down.

2398
02:19:19,491 --> 02:19:22,550
Was that the first terminator two
was it terminates Judgment Day?

2399
02:19:22,610 --> 02:19:23,443
Is that what it was?

2400
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:25,210
Okay.

2401
02:19:25,210 --> 02:19:28,270
It's going on right now.
Blade runner. Runner. We're

2402
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:32,720
right in it. There's drones. It's fucking
drunk. Slide around. What the fuck?

2403
02:19:32,721 --> 02:19:34,880
That was pretty fucking quick.
They just appeared. Yeah.

2404
02:19:34,881 --> 02:19:37,610
They said they're going to be 30,000
of them in the country within 10 years,

2405
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:42,980
but we need anonymous
on that fucking route.

2406
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:46,520
He's going to be a mass. Well they
got rid of those traffic cameras.

2407
02:19:46,521 --> 02:19:49,800
Have you noticed that those traffic
cameras to take pictures of you going

2408
02:19:49,801 --> 02:19:53,060
through the yellow light or red box to
have him? They got rid of them. Yeah.

2409
02:19:53,061 --> 02:19:56,000
They got rid of them cause I said,
I think they're unconstitutional.

2410
02:19:56,420 --> 02:19:59,330
I think there's something about
them that's a, that's illegal.

2411
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:03,410
I think it's because it's a private
company that put them up and the private

2412
02:20:03,411 --> 02:20:06,460
companies somehow or another
was profiting off of these, uh,

2413
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:09,830
people getting photographed going
through red lights and someone,

2414
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:14,840
someone questioned it. I'm doing a
terrible job of butchering the, uh,

2415
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:18,350
the argument or the story, but rather,
but, uh, I think that's what happened.

2416
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:22,160
Do you have any problem with
Johan and on me? No, man.

2417
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:24,560
That was just a very
disjointed podcast today.

2418
02:20:24,561 --> 02:20:28,520
We really didn't get it together ever
for ever more than 10 minutes at a time.

2419
02:20:29,390 --> 02:20:33,330
Next time we got to stop at like two hits.
I think two weeks is good on one.

2420
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:37,930
There's two joints. We did smoke too
much. We went, we went to crazy D's.

2421
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:39,440
I apologize.
Yeah.

2422
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:43,130
Well that's why I wasn't
even upset at Brian for,

2423
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:47,180
for logging into the beginning part.
You were so stolen.

2424
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:49,670
You didn't know what the
fuck you're doing. I don't
even know what was going on.

2425
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:54,230
You silly bitch. You didn't know what
the fuck was going on. Yeah. There's a,

2426
02:20:54,231 --> 02:20:57,350
there's a certain level where you really
shouldn't be talking into a microphone

2427
02:20:57,351 --> 02:21:01,190
in front of thousands of people when you
get high guy was that was that level.

2428
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:05,870
Like right now we're perfect right
now we can cook with gas down.

2429
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:09,800
This a fucking portal thing
is so confusing to me.

2430
02:21:09,830 --> 02:21:14,120
All this space stuff is so confusing
to me because I keep wanting to be the

2431
02:21:14,121 --> 02:21:16,180
skeptic. I keep wanting to
be the guy and he's like,

2432
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:20,150
nothing's going to happen now. They're
going to happen. I wasn't going to happen.

2433
02:21:20,151 --> 02:21:22,760
It's just life's going to be the same.
They'll discover a new planet.

2434
02:21:22,761 --> 02:21:26,000
You can't see it. Who gives a fuck?
Yeah. The thing's going to happen.

2435
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:28,520
Let's get video of that.
Yeah, and the creatures on it.

2436
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:33,380
That's how discovery channel's about
other planets. I mean, how fucking cool.

2437
02:21:33,381 --> 02:21:37,390
We're so, you know, we have like, we're
so impatient when it comes to, you know,

2438
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:40,910
discoveries and things,
we want it all to happen like all at once.

2439
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:44,150
Like when we look back in time,
it like what Galileo,

2440
02:21:44,151 --> 02:21:46,760
it figured out or
Copernicus had figured out.

2441
02:21:46,970 --> 02:21:49,520
I mean it's all stuff that
pretty much everybody knows now,

2442
02:21:49,521 --> 02:21:54,521
but back then it was just mind blowing
revelations about the nature of the

2443
02:21:54,771 --> 02:21:58,280
universe.
Now if you look at what like we know now,

2444
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:02,300
you know our little baby ass is known
now and what they're going to know.

2445
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:05,840
If we could just keep it together for a
hundred years just to keep it together

2446
02:22:05,841 --> 02:22:08,360
for a hundred years. Yeah, there's
going to be some crazy shit going on.

2447
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:10,640
Thinking about a hundred wasn't 19,
12.

2448
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:14,930
How much cocked did it suck in 1912.
It was terrible.

2449
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:18,710
The cars were dog shit. If they
even existed, they were dog shit.

2450
02:22:18,890 --> 02:22:21,380
You're riding around on dirt roads.
Everybody stays.

2451
02:22:21,410 --> 02:22:24,050
Thought it was cool that we get that
cars for the first time. They're like,

2452
02:22:24,051 --> 02:22:28,560
Holy Shit, this is the most
amazing part of life here.

2453
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:31,170
If we're not the edge of the
edge of technology, we have,

2454
02:22:31,171 --> 02:22:33,840
cars are going to think back
about us in 2000 years. Like, oh,

2455
02:22:33,841 --> 02:22:37,740
they didn't have hologram vaginas. I
think it's going to be, uh, you know,

2456
02:22:37,741 --> 02:22:40,800
we were always like looking for alien
life and we're always saying like,

2457
02:22:40,801 --> 02:22:43,290
we can't search alien life.
I don't think we're ready yet.

2458
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:46,530
And I think because we're not ready yet
because we're not really quite smart

2459
02:22:46,531 --> 02:22:50,020
enough to tune in to whatever the fuck
their frequency they're on, you know,

2460
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:54,870
wherever they are because of that.
That's why there's no evidence,

2461
02:22:54,871 --> 02:22:56,010
even though it makes sense.

2462
02:22:56,280 --> 02:23:00,840
I think we're going to come to a point
at a certain time where if our technology

2463
02:23:00,841 --> 02:23:03,060
expands and continues to expand,

2464
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:07,080
it's going to get to a point where there's
no spot in the universe that we can't

2465
02:23:07,081 --> 02:23:10,530
traverse. I mean, ultimately, if
people live for a million years,

2466
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:14,670
that's got to happen. I mean, what
we can do today is impossible. Well,

2467
02:23:14,671 --> 02:23:19,110
we can do in a thousand years from now
is going to be equally impossible to us

2468
02:23:19,111 --> 02:23:20,970
today. You know, everything
that's so normal,

2469
02:23:20,971 --> 02:23:25,971
like Wifi and cellular videos and texting
people pictures of your butt hole.

2470
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:30,460
You know that notice I looked
right at Brian, when did that,

2471
02:23:31,150 --> 02:23:34,680
I mean we were thinking about what a
thousand years from now, what you're,

2472
02:23:34,681 --> 02:23:38,280
you're going to have things that you can't
even wrap your head around today. It,

2473
02:23:38,281 --> 02:23:42,270
it most likely will involve
the manipulation of space
and time. We're going to,

2474
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:45,750
we're going to probably in a hundred
years from now have some ability to verse

2475
02:23:45,751 --> 02:23:49,490
long distances. That seems
possible. If we can get it,

2476
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:53,460
if we can just get over like a few
technological humps. Oh, and again,

2477
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:54,930
this is a hundred years from now.

2478
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:57,570
What do you really think it's
possible know about the God particle.

2479
02:23:57,571 --> 02:24:02,370
They just kind of discovered her.
Sounds very confusing. Um, it's,

2480
02:24:02,490 --> 02:24:03,323
they,

2481
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:08,420
there are 99.99% sure that they have
recreated this particle based on its mass.

2482
02:24:09,570 --> 02:24:13,500
And uh, they've, they've, they've
discovered some incredible shit, man.

2483
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:17,250
I mean it's the whole idea
behind it is really mind blowing.

2484
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:21,570
But what's going on is there,
they're tapping into the,

2485
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:26,460
the conditions and recreating
the conditions that are
like a millisecond after

2486
02:24:26,461 --> 02:24:31,461
the big bang and they're finding these
parts of the universe that they had

2487
02:24:31,741 --> 02:24:35,370
theorized about. And one of them
is this Higgs Boson particle.

2488
02:24:35,371 --> 02:24:38,430
That's God particle.
It's fucking,

2489
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:43,710
it's too hard for me to wrap my puny
brain around it, but when I do, it's, uh,

2490
02:24:43,730 --> 02:24:45,060
it's pretty staggering stuff.

2491
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:50,090
If you stop and consider where we were
in 1912 and where we are today and where

2492
02:24:50,611 --> 02:24:54,420
we're going to be 2012 with
this discovery of the Higgs,

2493
02:24:54,421 --> 02:24:56,310
Boston Boson,
whatever the fuck,

2494
02:24:56,330 --> 02:25:00,000
how do what we say and whatever the fuck
they're going to figure out within the

2495
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,300
next hundred years. I mean,
it's, what does that mean to
the, to the average person?

2496
02:25:03,330 --> 02:25:06,630
I don't know that we discovered the
God particle. I don't know nothing yet.

2497
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:08,610
Nothing yet. But it could
mean everything. It could,

2498
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:13,800
it's the God particle which stands dark
matter or dark matter. Here, let's,

2499
02:25:13,801 --> 02:25:16,440
uh, let's get a scientific
piece really quick. Okay.

2500
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:18,630
We'll get a scientific explanation of it.

2501
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:24,030
It's that c

2502
02:25:24,030 --> 02:25:27,960
two o coconut water. Sun,
Sun. Yeah. Note that, uh,

2503
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:30,100
we are in my place today.

2504
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:33,490
The reason being is because Brian
almost got cooked with electricity.

2505
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:37,150
That's also why we don't
have our Alienware laptops,

2506
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:41,190
but we are still supporting,
uh, Alienware and you know,

2507
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:44,710
Josh Barnett was very happy that we did
that because they support fighters and

2508
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:46,120
that's why we chose to do it.

2509
02:25:46,210 --> 02:25:50,410
It's a big giant ass computers if
you're a gamer than the shit man.

2510
02:25:50,411 --> 02:25:52,570
If have the game or if
you're like a hardcore Gamer,

2511
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:57,430
they like the best computers doing
the three d one three d games portal.

2512
02:25:57,460 --> 02:26:00,340
I've been playing in three days
because the laptop is insane.

2513
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:04,220
We got these mother fuckers got an 18,

2514
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:06,970
he got an 18 inch, which is insane. It's,

2515
02:26:06,971 --> 02:26:09,280
it's pretty much like an
imax that you can fold it up.

2516
02:26:09,281 --> 02:26:12,780
I got a 17 inch and it's
pretty cool, man. The,

2517
02:26:12,810 --> 02:26:15,940
the keyboards are all
light up different colors.

2518
02:26:16,220 --> 02:26:20,890
It's huge resolution and it's
really smooth for playing gaming.

2519
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:24,370
I'm doing pretty much using
it just for gaming now. Yeah.

2520
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:26,920
That's the only reason to use it.
They're their monster computers.

2521
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:28,990
If you're a hardcore game and
there's people like, you know,

2522
02:26:28,991 --> 02:26:32,440
oh he only wears like super
expensive and they are not that bad.

2523
02:26:32,441 --> 02:26:37,240
It's not cheap man. If you want a,
if you want a built up computer,

2524
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:38,170
you know,
it can be expensive,

2525
02:26:38,171 --> 02:26:41,860
but that's just but not compared to
Mac price as Max til pretty expensive.

2526
02:26:41,861 --> 02:26:45,100
I realized cause I went to
alienware's but it's Chi quality shit.

2527
02:26:45,101 --> 02:26:47,590
I mean that's why if you want,
if you build it together yourself,

2528
02:26:47,770 --> 02:26:51,540
you could probably build it for cheaper.
But a, I'm not building anything myself,

2529
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:53,640
man. I'm a grown man. Cooling. Yeah,

2530
02:26:53,890 --> 02:26:57,250
it doesn't have the that well those
laptops are special. Those are,

2531
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:00,730
those are fucking cool items
to have around. But uh,

2532
02:27:01,690 --> 02:27:05,770
but the reason why we're not supported,
we're not sponsored by Alienware.

2533
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:10,180
We're supporting a MMA. We're actually
sponsored by a company called punched.

2534
02:27:10,181 --> 02:27:13,660
What does it punch? Drunk love sacrifice
inside. I didn't punch entertainment.

2535
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:15,880
So that's where it's coming down from.

2536
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:18,820
So that they hooked us up with a
deal on the Alienware computers.

2537
02:27:18,821 --> 02:27:21,790
And linker said,
we try to support people that support MMA.

2538
02:27:21,791 --> 02:27:25,210
And we try to support good companies,
which is why I always talk about Cto,

2539
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:27,180
which is a fucking awesome.

2540
02:27:27,181 --> 02:27:31,300
This coconut juice from Thailand and I
got a new case that they just sent me

2541
02:27:31,301 --> 02:27:34,510
that has pulp in it. I haven't fucked
with it yet. I just got it today.

2542
02:27:34,570 --> 02:27:37,810
Do me a favor. I'm going to do this
live. Do you have any CTO left and night?

2543
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:39,070
That one right there?
Yes.

2544
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:42,120
I want you to take a sip of that and
I want you to take a sip of this.

2545
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:45,280
I'm not drinking it after you dry. I'll
wipe it off. I'll wipe it up. Good enough.

2546
02:27:47,250 --> 02:27:50,610
Start, stop. Don't want to do
it. Not Happening. All right.

2547
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:54,790
You want to be a woman too much? No,
no. There's cam feels weird to me. Oh,

2548
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:57,370
you got a bad can. I didn't
think so. Oh, go get another one.

2549
02:27:57,371 --> 02:28:00,340
See if it tastes different. I don't
know. I've never had a bad cam from them.

2550
02:28:00,790 --> 02:28:03,820
Is that something that happened? It was
just you. This is your, your reaction.

2551
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:07,000
It's warm to you like this.
Better than that.

2552
02:28:07,001 --> 02:28:10,990
A non pasteurized. Oh,
it's warm. You know what?

2553
02:28:11,050 --> 02:28:13,540
Because one of them was loose,

2554
02:28:13,541 --> 02:28:17,600
which had been in my refrigerator for
all like weeks and the other one just got

2555
02:28:17,601 --> 02:28:19,990
it in the refrigerator right before the
podcast started that you just pull it

2556
02:28:19,991 --> 02:28:21,980
out of that big package I opened that can

2557
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:26,990
see that case is not, that's not cold
yet. This stuff is, it's way better coal.

2558
02:28:26,991 --> 02:28:28,610
Better quote. Right? Yeah. Big Difference.

2559
02:28:28,611 --> 02:28:31,190
It tastes like it's completely
different than, yeah. Yeah.

2560
02:28:31,770 --> 02:28:34,130
Apparently they say that
it's from Thailand. Thailand.

2561
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:37,610
Coconuts are the most delicious and sweet
when it comes to their coconut water.

2562
02:28:37,940 --> 02:28:42,140
But, uh, if you can get fresh coconut
juice like a if few near a whole foods,

2563
02:28:42,141 --> 02:28:46,160
you should try. It's super expensive,
but God damn is it good. It's delicious.

2564
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:49,730
Fresh coconut juice where it hasn't been
pasteurized or homogenized just right

2565
02:28:49,731 --> 02:28:52,700
out of the coconut, but it doesn't
last very long. But man, if you get it,

2566
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:56,300
there's a company called it a press
juicery that I use. They're great, man.

2567
02:28:56,301 --> 02:28:59,300
That's a good press.
Coconut juice is so delicious.

2568
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:06,080
Uh, we're turning to you for conversation.
We're going to Vegas this weekend.

2569
02:29:06,390 --> 02:29:10,070
Last weekend. We never even broke
down. Silva versus Sonnen. Hmm.

2570
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:13,130
I talk a little bit about it,
but we didn't get to,

2571
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:16,780
do you think Anderson Silva was going
to be a completely different fighter?

2572
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:21,200
This fight? Just don't fucking know. It
could be. Yeah. You wonder like you man,

2573
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:25,760
he was, it was much easier to take down
than I expected in the first fight.

2574
02:29:25,761 --> 02:29:28,520
And he does, you know, that's it.
That is like a guy who was injured.

2575
02:29:28,550 --> 02:29:31,490
Like he didn't want to try to
stop the takedown. Who knows?

2576
02:29:31,580 --> 02:29:34,640
Maybe he's impossible to take down
at this point. Not going to happen.

2577
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:38,000
I don't know about that. Maybe it's,
the whole thing is interesting.

2578
02:29:38,210 --> 02:29:40,340
When a guy fights injured,
you just don't know.

2579
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:42,590
And Anderson's not a guy has ever said he,

2580
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,600
he fought different than
he ever fought before.

2581
02:29:44,930 --> 02:29:47,330
And he's not a type of guy
that makes excuses in the past,

2582
02:29:47,331 --> 02:29:51,020
like a lot of people don't know that he
had double knee surgery just five weeks

2583
02:29:51,021 --> 02:29:55,450
before he beat Travis. Luder. That's
the heat, you know, that's what, uh,

2584
02:29:55,610 --> 02:29:59,900
his manager told me. He told me, I
mean, that's a crazy thing. What he did,

2585
02:29:59,901 --> 02:30:04,040
he fought Travis Luder like right when
you're supposed to like not even be back

2586
02:30:04,041 --> 02:30:06,740
to training again. Yeah.
You know, five weeks in.

2587
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:10,940
So a guy who was willing to do that
and not tell anybody he did, you know,

2588
02:30:11,330 --> 02:30:14,890
beat Travis Luder a lot easier and more
convincingly than he'd be Chael Sonnen

2589
02:30:14,891 --> 02:30:19,160
though. So who knows? Who knows
how much it really bothered him.

2590
02:30:19,161 --> 02:30:22,850
But he won the bottom line is he figured
out a way to win and that's why it gets

2591
02:30:22,851 --> 02:30:27,560
interesting because if he's healthy
now and he doesn't have any injuries,

2592
02:30:27,561 --> 02:30:30,200
will he be able to stop
the shot now? Oh, you know,

2593
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:34,140
will it be an easier fight for him
or will it be the same fucking thing?

2594
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:39,020
Maybe sun and takes them down. Um,
maybe it's hard. Maybe it's easy,

2595
02:30:39,021 --> 02:30:41,630
but it takes him down and he and
his passing is getting better.

2596
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:44,960
What if he passes and triangles is
atrophies? So that could happen.

2597
02:30:44,961 --> 02:30:49,860
He's been working with Vinny Maga.
Exactly. And Vinny says, Hey, and he,

2598
02:30:49,861 --> 02:30:51,200
he might be trying to blow up jail,

2599
02:30:51,201 --> 02:30:54,650
but he says that he thinks that shale
has the ability to finish Anderson and I

2600
02:30:54,651 --> 02:30:55,970
believe it,
any,

2601
02:30:55,971 --> 02:31:00,971
any wrestler at that caliber has
the ability to squeeze in act.

2602
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,890
They just got to focus on it just
a little bit. You focus on it.

2603
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:07,820
If he just focused on RM triangles and
we'll make it chokes and a good team just

2604
02:31:07,821 --> 02:31:09,170
keep polishing this shit every day.

2605
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:12,710
Just keep drilling it slowly becoming
dangerous, which is those three.

2606
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:15,770
And of course you got to
get really good at passing.

2607
02:31:15,771 --> 02:31:18,620
Passing the guard is just as
important as taking a guy down.

2608
02:31:18,621 --> 02:31:20,130
You've got to get really
good at passing camp.

2609
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:23,490
Pass the guard man.
All you have is ground and pound and dude,

2610
02:31:23,491 --> 02:31:26,620
some nullify that pretty easily now.
So you got to,

2611
02:31:27,180 --> 02:31:30,330
and it seems like he's passing
and as fast past few fights,

2612
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:33,180
his passing was looking good and uh,
you know,

2613
02:31:33,181 --> 02:31:36,300
he got her arm trying controlled
Bisping on the ground too,

2614
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:40,080
which is really hard to do. Bisping
is very good defensively off his back.

2615
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:42,090
You know,
jail wasn't able to submit him,

2616
02:31:42,091 --> 02:31:43,770
but he controlled him for
quite awhile on the ground.

2617
02:31:43,771 --> 02:31:46,970
But what he did with Brian Stan
was really impressive. Yeah,

2618
02:31:47,130 --> 02:31:50,580
he's smushed that guy. You look at it and
that's like some serious pressure. His,

2619
02:31:50,581 --> 02:31:54,810
his arm triangle is super legit. Brian.
Stan was defending the right way to,

2620
02:31:54,811 --> 02:31:56,460
but it was for, nope, you didn't matter.

2621
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:59,520
He squeezes too hard when you
get a good one of those things,

2622
02:31:59,521 --> 02:32:02,550
when a guy really develops a good one,
when they really get a feel for it,

2623
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:04,680
especially when they were a big wrestler,

2624
02:32:04,681 --> 02:32:08,430
like a chill son and guy already has
like a sick squeeze and it's sick.

2625
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:12,060
Top game is sick balance and just
knows how to crush things down.

2626
02:32:12,330 --> 02:32:15,720
They lock onto one technique like
that. Man, they become so dangerous.

2627
02:32:15,721 --> 02:32:19,200
Even when year's Eve, when you're
defending, you still can get submitted.

2628
02:32:19,540 --> 02:32:21,910
Just crushes your fucking head.
You know?

2629
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:25,620
If that guy gets a hold of your head
and arm, you're done so on, you're done.

2630
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:28,260
It's amazing.
I'll dude's like Cody McKenzie.

2631
02:32:28,261 --> 02:32:32,460
They just lock onto one fucking
technique and get so laser sharp at it.

2632
02:32:32,730 --> 02:32:34,080
They pull it off on everybody,

2633
02:32:34,081 --> 02:32:36,960
even though dudes know they're trying
to pull it off. We got obsessed with it.

2634
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:38,310
They put a lot of numbers in.

2635
02:32:39,090 --> 02:32:43,530
That can happen with any technique
that Cody Mackenzie's fucking guilty.

2636
02:32:43,531 --> 02:32:46,530
It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous.
I've never seen a guy,

2637
02:32:46,610 --> 02:32:49,830
what does he have like 11 wins by
gay t now? Something like that.

2638
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:52,920
So kratom incredible.
Always chokes at the same arm.

2639
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:56,790
Joey said that there was Marcel, he
always showed his right arm. It's amazing.

2640
02:32:57,510 --> 02:33:01,860
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm still sad that
Marcel never got back into MMA.

2641
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:06,230
He had a one fight or he got cut and a,

2642
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:08,520
he had a hard time using
the gloves at our time.

2643
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:12,420
Strangling a guy with those gloves on.
I guess it makes a big goddamn difference.

2644
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:14,220
And then the grease two
got to get used to that.

2645
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:17,490
There's a big difference between gay and
Nogi and then there's a big difference

2646
02:33:17,491 --> 02:33:20,130
between rash guard and no rash
guard. Yeah, that's right.

2647
02:33:22,050 --> 02:33:27,030
It's not the same thing.
It's way more Slippy, Slippy
point man. Do you think that,

2648
02:33:27,390 --> 02:33:31,710
like when, when you see guys in Abu
Dhabi and things along those lines,

2649
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:33,600
do you think that they
should be able to wear pants?

2650
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:36,200
Do you think they should be a little
aware? Well, and I'm with obviously cow.

2651
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:39,690
You can't wear pants. You wear the
pants. You could wear anything you want.

2652
02:33:39,691 --> 02:33:41,520
You could wear a g if you
want it. Really? Yeah.

2653
02:33:41,521 --> 02:33:45,360
You can wear anything and I would not be.
And can your opponent grab that key? Um,

2654
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:46,540
you know what,
there's,

2655
02:33:46,630 --> 02:33:50,970
there's some tournaments out there that
have ridiculous rules that they just

2656
02:33:50,971 --> 02:33:54,060
don't, it's just the most
ignorant shit out there.

2657
02:33:54,061 --> 02:33:56,580
It's amazing that it still exists.
Like some tournaments,

2658
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:00,280
they allow you to work g pants
and I know g tournament, but uh,

2659
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:03,600
your opponent can grab them and
in control, but you can't grab it.

2660
02:34:03,601 --> 02:34:07,590
And control shorts. I said,
yeah, let them control the pants.

2661
02:34:07,591 --> 02:34:11,970
But why can't I grab his shorts?
He's grabbing my pants just because his,

2662
02:34:12,030 --> 02:34:15,180
his pants are shorter.
It makes zero sense.

2663
02:34:15,181 --> 02:34:18,190
If you're going to allow someone to grab
pants, you should be able to grab shorts

2664
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:22,450
or don't allow it at all. Don't allow
grabbing at anything. Just seems weird.

2665
02:34:22,451 --> 02:34:27,250
If you have pants on and you have a g on,
you're allowed to grab it,

2666
02:34:27,251 --> 02:34:29,980
but if you just both are wearing shorts,
you're not allowed to grab it.

2667
02:34:30,010 --> 02:34:32,250
It's ridiculous. It gets tricky. Yeah,

2668
02:34:32,270 --> 02:34:34,210
it's stupid shit like you think
they should have to do that?

2669
02:34:34,211 --> 02:34:36,070
Everybody should have to
fight just skin on skin.

2670
02:34:36,071 --> 02:34:38,110
Just valley to those shorts and that's it.
No,

2671
02:34:38,111 --> 02:34:39,730
I think you should be able
to wear anything you want.

2672
02:34:39,790 --> 02:34:43,610
I like the way the Japanese ran it.
If you want to come in with a a kito gay,

2673
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:45,710
let them come up with an a keno game.
What happens is,

2674
02:34:45,870 --> 02:34:49,270
is that the boxing people
that made all these rules,

2675
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:54,130
they didn't understand what was exactly
what was going on, what you did.

2676
02:34:54,131 --> 02:34:55,510
So they thought we're going to,

2677
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:58,900
we're not going to give
anybody an unfair advantage.

2678
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:00,940
So we're going to take away
the key because people,

2679
02:35:01,090 --> 02:35:05,230
they saw hoists choking out Ken shamrock
with this color or with his sleeve.

2680
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:08,410
But really in Japan you
can want anything you want.

2681
02:35:08,530 --> 02:35:12,910
And if the pants were that dangerous,
all the Brazilians would be wearing pants.

2682
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:15,850
How come? No, no. Brazilians are
wearing pants except for hoists.

2683
02:35:16,150 --> 02:35:18,010
The pants aren't dangerous.

2684
02:35:18,310 --> 02:35:23,310
What they do is try to even out the
playing field because people are wearing

2685
02:35:23,531 --> 02:35:26,500
fucking, uh, uh, Vaseline.

2686
02:35:26,501 --> 02:35:29,050
People or Vaseline binders are
always squeezing themselves up.

2687
02:35:29,051 --> 02:35:30,040
Strikers are you kidding?

2688
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:32,950
They don't want to go out
there and get strangled at all.

2689
02:35:32,951 --> 02:35:37,750
Putting on Greece the night before.
It's not all a lot though.

2690
02:35:37,810 --> 02:35:39,670
Not all, but a lot. How are they doing it?

2691
02:35:39,671 --> 02:35:43,810
What do you think is the most common
way they do it? If people like, uh,

2692
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:48,840
this is what I've heard is it'll take
like cocoa butter and like sleep with it

2693
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:52,180
and then wash it off the next morning.
So your,

2694
02:35:52,310 --> 02:35:54,490
your skin appears to be dry and
then when you start sweating,

2695
02:35:54,491 --> 02:35:58,510
it comes out of your pores. That's, you
know, even finding a leg lock wizard,

2696
02:35:58,570 --> 02:36:01,210
you're going to shave your fucking
legs in, grease up. You know? And,

2697
02:36:01,211 --> 02:36:04,270
and not only that, not only that,
another thing that came from boxing,

2698
02:36:04,310 --> 02:36:09,070
that's what's up with all the
Vaseline all over people's faces.

2699
02:36:09,130 --> 02:36:11,380
You don't think that gets
all over their bodies.

2700
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:15,460
A lot of times people get accused of
greasing and Henderson is in fights,

2701
02:36:15,461 --> 02:36:18,940
wiped it off his face and under his
chest. Well, whether you do that or not,

2702
02:36:19,060 --> 02:36:22,450
when you're fighting and you're grappling,
dude's touching your face,

2703
02:36:22,510 --> 02:36:26,480
touching your chin and he's touching
your arm. It's, these guys are, are,

2704
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:31,390
or have Vaseline all over their body
by the end of the fight. So that's a,

2705
02:36:31,391 --> 02:36:35,260
an unfair advantage to a striker. You
know, it's harder to get submissions.

2706
02:36:35,380 --> 02:36:39,660
We should be pushing to get
more submissions. You know,

2707
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:42,970
in professional football
they push for more authentic.

2708
02:36:42,971 --> 02:36:47,410
They change rules and adjust shit for
more often. Same thing in basketball.

2709
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:51,310
What you're saying is that if they
wore just allowed to wear rash guards,

2710
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:54,790
that would basically even up all the
problems that we have with grease.

2711
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:57,220
If you want to.
You don't have to if you want to.

2712
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:00,610
Some people don't want to wear shit cause
remember and in Japan you could wear

2713
02:37:00,611 --> 02:37:05,320
anything you want and what the Jujitsu
guys chose to wear his little tiny shorts.

2714
02:37:05,321 --> 02:37:09,110
They just had a lot of ways for
us. We went to pants. Yes, yes.

2715
02:37:09,150 --> 02:37:10,810
No pants top with pants on.

2716
02:37:10,811 --> 02:37:14,290
But then he ended up fighting MMA was
shortens no ports for 25 when he fought

2717
02:37:14,291 --> 02:37:15,970
Matt Hughes. That was
one. So that was again,

2718
02:37:16,050 --> 02:37:18,230
they didn't allow him to wear
anything else. Yeah, totally.

2719
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:23,400
And the fact that pants are like karate
pants or a geek pans are not allowed to

2720
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:27,600
wear like tights, like the
way a Aoki wears tights. It's,

2721
02:37:27,601 --> 02:37:30,060
it's counterproductive for the sport,
you know,

2722
02:37:30,061 --> 02:37:34,430
it just let them go would be a good
way to counteract the idea. You know,

2723
02:37:34,431 --> 02:37:39,230
everybody's greasy, greasy people
are greasy and if they're not,

2724
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:40,760
they got Vaseline all over their face.

2725
02:37:40,761 --> 02:37:44,180
It's going to get all over their body
and it makes it hard to all that Vaseline

2726
02:37:44,181 --> 02:37:48,230
all over your face makes it harder to
pull off submissions late in the fight.

2727
02:37:48,350 --> 02:37:53,090
You mixed that Vaseline with sweat and
blood we should be like, it would be like,

2728
02:37:53,091 --> 02:37:53,420
uh,

2729
02:37:53,420 --> 02:37:58,420
like banning tights would be like banning
a wide receivers wearing gloves in

2730
02:38:00,051 --> 02:38:01,880
like rainy days or snowy days.

2731
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,180
They let them wear gloves so they
could catch the ball. More authentic,

2732
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:08,630
more drop balls means shitty play.
People get bored,

2733
02:38:08,631 --> 02:38:13,070
they want more high scoring. But that's
not a person, the balls on a person.

2734
02:38:13,071 --> 02:38:13,731
The problem is,

2735
02:38:13,731 --> 02:38:16,760
the idea is that someone should be able
to have the best defense possible with

2736
02:38:16,761 --> 02:38:19,030
two men with bare skin. Yeah. I've also,

2737
02:38:19,050 --> 02:38:22,220
one guy's wearing some sticky close
and a lot of it, but it's okay.

2738
02:38:22,310 --> 02:38:26,600
And the amateurs in California, they let
him wear rash guard. It's no problem.

2739
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:29,150
Yeah. In the amateurs you were
rash guards, just no problem.

2740
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:31,550
What about after that you
would change the game? Female,

2741
02:38:31,610 --> 02:38:36,290
female MMA fighters where rash guards.
How was that? Okay, that's unfortunate.

2742
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:40,040
Yeah, totally. But like how has
that, I mean, how's that? Okay.

2743
02:38:40,041 --> 02:38:42,550
They have an unfair advantage.
You should be allowed.

2744
02:38:42,580 --> 02:38:46,550
You should be allowed to wear rash guards.
I mean it works in female and then a,

2745
02:38:46,730 --> 02:38:49,460
it should, we should allow it in
the pros to what's the big deal?

2746
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:50,900
It's just a rash guard.
It'd be nice.

2747
02:38:50,901 --> 02:38:54,110
People would come in with like tights
and they look like little super hero

2748
02:38:54,111 --> 02:38:55,040
characters.
It'd be cool.

2749
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:58,900
Like Aoki was just his famous for
the different crazy pants. He waters.

2750
02:38:58,910 --> 02:39:01,330
It was for his fighting
some down for a tights.

2751
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:04,010
The only problem that I would have with
the [inaudible] is that you can use the

2752
02:39:04,011 --> 02:39:05,720
gears and weapon.
You get to Zeke,

2753
02:39:05,721 --> 02:39:09,290
you'll choke the fuck out of somebody and
that doesn't feel yes, yes, but again,

2754
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:12,380
in pride they allowed that,
but no, but the, there's,

2755
02:39:12,680 --> 02:39:16,700
there's way more cons to pros that were
in geese. As far as the Geek experts.

2756
02:39:16,701 --> 02:39:20,840
The expert said, you know what? Yeah,
I could choke you out with my sleep,

2757
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:24,770
but dude can choke me out with my
own color so it's not even worth it.

2758
02:39:25,020 --> 02:39:28,450
You know what I mean? Amber, you
remember when Yoshida, Fort Hoists? Yep.

2759
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:32,240
Yoshida fought hoists and he said he
was out and he wasn't out. He lied.

2760
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:34,370
Totally made up. The fact that
he was out, he's like, he's,

2761
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:37,850
he's not even barely choking them
voices, like foot was up and shit. I,

2762
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:40,010
there was no way he
could've been out like his,

2763
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:42,920
he was like holding his foot
up and now he's out. He's out.

2764
02:39:42,950 --> 02:39:45,590
And then like reverie stops and he's like,
what the fuck are you doing?

2765
02:39:45,591 --> 02:39:48,860
I ain't out. They totally
bamboozle them. Yeah.

2766
02:39:48,861 --> 02:39:52,550
There's a lot of tomfoolery going
on in Japan and that was with a,

2767
02:39:52,551 --> 02:39:56,650
that was where the Ie, you
know, he was wrapping them
up in the gate. It goes away.

2768
02:39:56,720 --> 02:40:00,290
But again, it's, it's, it's, if it
was an advantage to where Aggie,

2769
02:40:00,710 --> 02:40:04,610
all the Brazilians coming
over and fighting and pride
that all be wearing gies

2770
02:40:04,611 --> 02:40:07,430
and g pants, you know what I
mean? It's not an advantage.

2771
02:40:07,431 --> 02:40:10,220
So amazing that hoist chose to
fight like that though. He was,

2772
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:13,290
but then when you watch like Hickson's
fights with Zulu, he never wore a,

2773
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,040
he worried a little tight

2774
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:18,360
shorts. Yeah. Interesting. In the
long run, the is a disadvantage.

2775
02:40:18,361 --> 02:40:20,910
That's what the Brazilians
are saying by not wearing it.

2776
02:40:20,911 --> 02:40:23,460
They're making that statement.
Yeah. That's kind of crazy.

2777
02:40:23,461 --> 02:40:27,210
When you stop and think about it, there's
this ancient outfit that people were,

2778
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:31,350
you know, they'd been wearing for how
long? Thousand years. Who knows how many,

2779
02:40:31,530 --> 02:40:36,510
how many years of martial artists from
wearing baggy, you know, or taekwondo,

2780
02:40:36,511 --> 02:40:40,550
they call the Doh Buck, you know, and
uh, I dunno, what is it called? Kim Mono.

2781
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:42,840
Is that what the Portuguese
like to call it? The Brazilians?

2782
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:46,470
I think that's a Japanese word. Yes. But
they use the word Kimona was falling,

2783
02:40:46,471 --> 02:40:49,710
right? Yeah. Japanese definitely
called Kimono. But that's what, uh,

2784
02:40:50,220 --> 02:40:53,940
that's what the Brazilian Jujitsu guys
referred to it, right? Yeah. Yeah.

2785
02:40:53,941 --> 02:40:55,050
We didn't accept Kimono.

2786
02:40:55,051 --> 02:40:59,100
We took g and that weird when it got
over here became a gay cause it went from

2787
02:40:59,101 --> 02:41:04,101
being Komono to the Brazilian Japanese
Kimono and Brazilian Komono g in the

2788
02:41:04,831 --> 02:41:09,210
Brazilians didn't call it G. I don't know.
I think Americans don't Americans, uh,

2789
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:11,400
very rarely called Kimonos.
And when they do, you know,

2790
02:41:11,401 --> 02:41:13,890
there are serious Jujitsu Dork.
You know,

2791
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:17,940
somebody asks you what Brand Kimono
do you were you serious Jujitsu Dork?

2792
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:22,530
Some dude's just get so caught up
in Jujitsu mad. It's just like,

2793
02:41:22,531 --> 02:41:25,080
it's so much fun when you
first start tapping guys.

2794
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:29,400
It becomes so much fun that some guys
just completely lose their shit and just,

2795
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:33,640
just dive into it. Yeah. I
was just too fucking free.

2796
02:41:33,750 --> 02:41:36,690
I was thinking about getting out.
One of those Americans are so into it.

2797
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:40,470
I love Brazil.
Went to Brazil in 2010 in 2003.

2798
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:43,320
I fucking love anything Brazilian.

2799
02:41:43,321 --> 02:41:47,310
Anytime a Brazilian was fighting and MMA,
he could be fighting a Mexican.

2800
02:41:47,311 --> 02:41:50,490
I don't give a shit. I'm gone for the
Brazilian. I'm, oh, I was so hardcore.

2801
02:41:50,491 --> 02:41:54,110
I would've got a tattoo of a Brazilian
flag on my bag with that. Oh,

2802
02:41:54,111 --> 02:41:58,190
Denny progressive thing on it. I would
consider that shit. That is a dose.

2803
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:02,510
Hardcore Dope logo. The
presenter. Oh dammit.

2804
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:03,760
You Progresso.
Uh,

2805
02:42:03,810 --> 02:42:08,810
like maybe a then my guess is
a oath promise to progress.

2806
02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:12,370
I don't know.
Some fun country man pursued it.

2807
02:42:12,590 --> 02:42:15,690
They're the only country that
shuts down for a month to party.

2808
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:18,630
It's beautiful man. There are
people down. They're really fun.

2809
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:21,540
I really enjoyed doing
the UFC is down there.

2810
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:26,280
The audiences are like nothing you've
ever seen in your life. In between fights.

2811
02:42:26,281 --> 02:42:28,800
They were doing the wave
and screaming and cheering.

2812
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:33,360
I mean like the level of passion that
the Brazilian fans have. It's not,

2813
02:42:33,361 --> 02:42:38,310
no one's close. No one is close. Not
Americans. And we've been everywhere.

2814
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:40,880
We've been fucking, no
one's, no one's closed.

2815
02:42:41,190 --> 02:42:45,990
Smash everybody with loyalty,
sell it.

2816
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:50,770
Celebration, you know, singing
and Jujitsu tournaments.

2817
02:42:51,130 --> 02:42:53,760
I went to Brazil in 2000
for the worlds and it was,

2818
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:56,370
it wasn't out of like a giant place.

2819
02:42:56,400 --> 02:43:00,810
It was kind of like at an old beat up
kind of arena. Like a mini beat up arena.

2820
02:43:00,930 --> 02:43:02,520
It was like a,
it wasn't that great.

2821
02:43:03,090 --> 02:43:07,890
And those motherfuckers had drums
and shit. They had all these chats.

2822
02:43:07,950 --> 02:43:10,080
It was like a high school
gym and they were going nuts.

2823
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:13,340
They would have crushed your leaders.
They would have fucked him off.

2824
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:14,530
Do you remember?
Um,

2825
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:17,830
when we were in Abu Dhabi and they
started singing in the middle,

2826
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:20,280
like jock array was fighting
and someone started the deal.

2827
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:22,650
It sounded like they got songs, man. Yeah.

2828
02:43:23,230 --> 02:43:27,820
Singing and pounding on the tables or
the, uh, the chairs like drums. I mean,

2829
02:43:27,821 --> 02:43:31,090
it's amazing, man. They, they got into
it to the point where it was like,

2830
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:35,050
it was like you were like, it was like,
uh, you're, you're privileged to be there.

2831
02:43:35,051 --> 02:43:36,850
Like you didn't know that
there was a place like this.

2832
02:43:36,850 --> 02:43:37,870
He didn't know that this was,

2833
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:40,840
that this was something that was
going on out there in the world.

2834
02:43:40,870 --> 02:43:44,440
He wants these bad ass Jujitsu guys
fight and then these Brazilian guys are

2835
02:43:44,441 --> 02:43:47,320
singing and dancing in the fucking crowds.

2836
02:43:47,950 --> 02:43:50,260
And do you think it's a
coincidence that Brazil,

2837
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:55,090
maybe the only country or the only country
part of the UN? I don't know exactly,

2838
02:43:55,091 --> 02:43:58,120
but Brazil is super rare in the,

2839
02:43:58,360 --> 02:44:03,360
they go against you and drug policies
and make Iowasca Legal Eagle there.

2840
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:08,110
You think that has, I mean, I hear
that in Brazil and I could be wrong,

2841
02:44:08,111 --> 02:44:10,560
but I saw this in documentary.
It could be bullshit, but they,

2842
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:13,660
that a lot of people give,
there's like an io, there's an,

2843
02:44:13,661 --> 02:44:18,661
I lost a Christian religion that's kind
of like a mesh of boat and they give I

2844
02:44:20,741 --> 02:44:21,880
WASC it a babies,

2845
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:27,150
they give Iowasca when you're 14 to
prevent alcoholism somehow if you have,

2846
02:44:28,490 --> 02:44:28,950
um,

2847
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:33,950
I WASC in your system before alcohol or
maybe even after some in some way does

2848
02:44:35,441 --> 02:44:38,500
something to your brain or
somehow spiritually, I dunno,

2849
02:44:38,740 --> 02:44:42,970
but it keeps you from being an alcoholic,
a waste case. And Brazil is like,

2850
02:44:42,971 --> 02:44:45,310
fuck it.
I WASC is legal bitch.

2851
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:50,320
And who parties harder than Brazil
who celebrates more than Brazil?

2852
02:44:50,620 --> 02:44:53,650
Those guys are fucking insane.
I'm sure it has to have some impact.

2853
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:58,510
But marijuana is illegal. They're really,
uh, really illegal. It's not good at all.

2854
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:02,920
You gotta be, you know, gotta
be what it is. It is illegal.

2855
02:45:02,921 --> 02:45:07,720
But a lot of Brazilian jujitsu players,
they smoked weed.

2856
02:45:08,310 --> 02:45:11,830
Very popular in Jujitsu, but it's,
sorry, you got to have to deal with some,

2857
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:12,520
you know,

2858
02:45:12,520 --> 02:45:16,480
people that are selling illegal drugs
and the weirdest shit down there too.

2859
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:20,170
So I think South America just all
together shit weed. It's unfortunate.

2860
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:24,520
It's ridiculous. And it's uh, it's
uh, hopefully one day. I mean,

2861
02:45:24,521 --> 02:45:27,670
can you imagine if Brazil had
medical marijuana? Oh my God.

2862
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:32,820
If Brazil had legalized weed on top of
the way they rocket right now on top of

2863
02:45:32,981 --> 02:45:35,950
the greatest crowds of all time
on top of the most insane beaches.

2864
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:38,870
You look out and see islands and shit.
Dudes are selling coconuts.

2865
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:42,260
If they had weed for free
too, I mean, legal weed. Yeah,

2866
02:45:42,420 --> 02:45:44,080
it would be the most
ridiculous country of all time.

2867
02:45:45,010 --> 02:45:47,140
It's weird how cultures
just grow up and it's,

2868
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:50,530
a lot of it is depending on
how bad where you live sucks.

2869
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:53,920
You couldn't have a lifestyle like Brazil.
If you lived in Iceland like bitch,

2870
02:45:53,921 --> 02:45:55,330
you got to go out and kill a whale.
Okay.

2871
02:45:55,331 --> 02:45:58,510
It's a fucking were when a freeze
to death. Okay, we need some food.

2872
02:45:58,690 --> 02:46:01,600
We need to batten down the hatches.
We need to not in Brazil,

2873
02:46:01,601 --> 02:46:04,960
you don't have to batten down the hatches.
It's awesome out even in the winter,

2874
02:46:04,961 --> 02:46:09,380
it's awesome. So what do they do? They
they fucking party. That's totally cool.

2875
02:46:09,440 --> 02:46:10,040
It's totally

2876
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:14,870
Brazilian and totally cool and not to
be like honest, like a strict schedule.

2877
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:18,080
They love to say, hey, you
know when you're in Brazil,

2878
02:46:18,520 --> 02:46:21,230
he and Machado told him in this man,
I went to Brazil the first time.

2879
02:46:21,530 --> 02:46:23,390
We kept telling him like, we got
to do this. We're going to do that.

2880
02:46:23,391 --> 02:46:26,600
Goes relax in Brazil there is no time.

2881
02:46:26,930 --> 02:46:29,360
There's no time in Brazil and like,
Whoa,

2882
02:46:29,361 --> 02:46:32,450
these guys do whatever the fuck they
want to do whenever they want to do it.

2883
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:36,090
It's all about having fun. There's a
dude that I met down there that was a,

2884
02:46:36,460 --> 02:46:40,400
I think he's a Machado black.
I forget his name, I apologize.

2885
02:46:40,670 --> 02:46:43,450
But he was telling me that
he moved back there and uh,

2886
02:46:43,460 --> 02:46:46,460
the late nineties he
moved in Brazil and uh,

2887
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:50,060
just started living there and
he just loved it. And he said,

2888
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:53,120
the one thing that you got to get used
to though is like when you need something

2889
02:46:53,121 --> 02:46:54,740
fixed,
like good luck.

2890
02:46:56,150 --> 02:46:59,870
You need to do the show but your house
at a certain time, well he might show up,

2891
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:02,300
you know, but you know, shit happens.

2892
02:47:02,810 --> 02:47:07,460
I remember in the early nineties one
Jujitsu blew up because of hoists. Gracie,

2893
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:08,660
because of the UFC,

2894
02:47:09,230 --> 02:47:12,710
a lot of Brazilians started fucking
making the move and opening up shop and

2895
02:47:12,711 --> 02:47:14,960
taking territory's and
so went to New York.

2896
02:47:15,260 --> 02:47:18,740
How went to San Francisco and
Machado's went to southern California.

2897
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:20,690
Horry on southern California.
Everyone's just like,

2898
02:47:20,990 --> 02:47:23,060
it's like the gold rush
for Brazilian Jujitsu.

2899
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:28,760
You think about how many high
level Jujitsu schools are
in California? Hell yeah,

2900
02:47:28,761 --> 02:47:32,480
they're all coming to California nuts.
They're all coming in and Miami,

2901
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:35,810
they want the nice weather. They want
the nice weather, they want the surfing,

2902
02:47:35,870 --> 02:47:39,500
but they're still go to Toronto.
Brazilians are locators,
man. Don't fucking real.

2903
02:47:39,510 --> 02:47:42,730
Okay. Just, yeah, there's
some, there's some spots that
is wide open, but you know,

2904
02:47:42,740 --> 02:47:45,820
you really want to open shop in Wisconsin
or something and then you want to go

2905
02:47:45,821 --> 02:47:48,790
to hang for a while.
Cause like even Salo and Shonda,

2906
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:50,930
they went to Ohio for a while.
They went,

2907
02:47:50,931 --> 02:47:55,340
but there's only so much a Brazilian
kid could do in Hawaii or in Ohio.

2908
02:47:55,590 --> 02:48:00,290
So they said fuck it. They
came to San Diego. Well, I'm
like, uh, what's his name?

2909
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:05,090
Um, a no pile. Gabriel Gonzaga.
He's in western Massachusetts. Man,

2910
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:09,210
it's cold as fuck out there.
Right. Big Difference.

2911
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:12,770
Cause Marcella went to New York and
then he went to Florida and they said,

2912
02:48:12,771 --> 02:48:17,210
fuck it. He didn't like the weather in
Florida. He went back. He loves New York.

2913
02:48:17,370 --> 02:48:21,710
Well, New York is, if you're a thinking
person, and Marcel was a thinking person,

2914
02:48:21,711 --> 02:48:24,470
New York is much more stimulating,
more stimulating people.

2915
02:48:24,610 --> 02:48:27,200
Florida is nice and everything like that.
But God damn though,

2916
02:48:27,230 --> 02:48:31,460
I mean intelligence level in Florida
Henzel some fucking New York.

2917
02:48:31,690 --> 02:48:35,330
Kenzo fucking owns New York
did he is the Godfather.

2918
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:40,010
He's like John Gotti of Jujitsu that our,
he is that shit. Fuck yeah. And he's got,

2919
02:48:40,100 --> 02:48:43,900
he's got a ridiculous number of students.
Yeah.

2920
02:48:43,910 --> 02:48:46,880
And he's making some serious
bank and that guy and he's,

2921
02:48:47,150 --> 02:48:51,020
he's one of the nicest guys on the planet,
you know what I mean? He's fucking,

2922
02:48:51,140 --> 02:48:54,360
he's on Twitter all the time. Just
spreading positivity. You know,

2923
02:48:54,460 --> 02:48:59,110
Marcello on Twitter, he's on Twitter.
Not as much as Hanzo. Those on Twitter.

2924
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:03,200
Fucking I'm like, isn't it like five
in the morning in New York right now?

2925
02:49:03,201 --> 02:49:07,860
And he's still like, just
Twitter, all just positive
shit. Pencil is just positive.

2926
02:49:07,861 --> 02:49:08,240
Positive

2927
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:11,790
is he's aware. Where are they? How
far away are they from each other?

2928
02:49:11,791 --> 02:49:13,950
Handle school and Marcel school
and they're really close.

2929
02:49:13,951 --> 02:49:15,330
They're both in Manhattan.
Really close.

2930
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:20,130
But Marcel also has a very
successful school too, but hands are,

2931
02:49:20,131 --> 02:49:24,750
I think Hanzo has been around forever.
Yeah. Marcel was much more recent.

2932
02:49:24,751 --> 02:49:29,250
But Marcello has that Josh Waitzkin
dude, that chest wizard. That was, yup.

2933
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:31,670
I met him last time, I was
in New York. Really cool guy.

2934
02:49:32,110 --> 02:49:35,730
I exchanged some emails with them.
Brown Marcello's guys are fucking so cool.

2935
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:40,270
The guy that they based the movie
searching for Bobby Fischer. Yup. Yup.

2936
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:43,380
He was a chess genius.
Spent all his life doing that.

2937
02:49:43,381 --> 02:49:46,680
And then he got into martial arts and
initially got into Kung Fu and then uh,

2938
02:49:46,681 --> 02:49:49,680
I think he was doing push hands,
like those push hands competitions.

2939
02:49:49,890 --> 02:49:53,280
And then he got into Jujitsu and fell in
love with it and started breaking moves

2940
02:49:53,281 --> 02:49:57,180
down sort of the same way in a disciplined
approach to the way that he learned

2941
02:49:57,181 --> 02:49:58,410
to play chess.
You know,

2942
02:49:58,411 --> 02:50:02,070
cause they learn to like think of moves
and chains and progressions and so he

2943
02:50:02,071 --> 02:50:06,480
broke it down as a discipline,
you know, and made that Mj and uh,

2944
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:09,220
mg inaction website and uh,

2945
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:12,780
he's got all the different techniques
labeler and you have that shame shit going

2946
02:50:12,781 --> 02:50:16,290
on to add a at 10th planet Jiu
Jitsu [inaudible] Dot com right.

2947
02:50:16,291 --> 02:50:20,280
You can go there and you have it set up
where you have all the different moves

2948
02:50:20,281 --> 02:50:23,580
and techniques and someone doesn't
even have to like train here.

2949
02:50:24,230 --> 02:50:28,380
They can learn your shit online and
then bring it to a local Jujitsu gym and

2950
02:50:28,470 --> 02:50:32,310
practices. I release episodes of the
show called mastering the system.

2951
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:37,050
I release one every few weeks and has
every technique that I teach at my school.

2952
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:40,200
I put it up online for four 99 so yeah,

2953
02:50:40,201 --> 02:50:42,300
it's an amazing resource for
someone who lives somewhere.

2954
02:50:42,301 --> 02:50:43,720
Like say if you're stuck
somewhere and they,

2955
02:50:43,780 --> 02:50:46,440
they don't have any high level Jujitsu,

2956
02:50:46,441 --> 02:50:49,380
you can get together with your friends
and you could start a club, you know,

2957
02:50:49,381 --> 02:50:50,820
you can, you could, you know,

2958
02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:54,390
get a certain amount of people and
maybe they have mats at the y Ymca.

2959
02:50:54,430 --> 02:50:56,850
When I was a kid,
the why I'm say had mats like you could,

2960
02:50:56,880 --> 02:50:59,010
you could set some adds up
and you could start a club.

2961
02:50:59,190 --> 02:51:01,530
There's so many guys out there,
so many ruins.

2962
02:51:01,531 --> 02:51:06,080
They're getting two or three of their
friends putting mats in the garage. Again,

2963
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:10,260
Marcello, you can study, you know, the
Mendez Brother Study Edrick of out,

2964
02:51:10,440 --> 02:51:15,300
you can get mastering the system, put it
all together and have some fucking fun.

2965
02:51:15,301 --> 02:51:16,710
And then they'll take trips.
Sometimes.

2966
02:51:16,711 --> 02:51:18,390
Like a lot of these guys
will come in and you know,

2967
02:51:18,391 --> 02:51:20,880
they'll train in Manhattan for a week,
you know,

2968
02:51:20,881 --> 02:51:24,330
like that's what George Saint Pierre did
when he was young when Hanzo and train

2969
02:51:24,331 --> 02:51:27,370
there, or they'll go to John jocks
or they'll go to your gym. You know,

2970
02:51:27,390 --> 02:51:28,900
we're in Burbank now,
folks who view,

2971
02:51:28,901 --> 02:51:33,480
if you were looking for the legends
went under due to unforeseeable

2972
02:51:33,481 --> 02:51:37,080
circumstances. So, uh, if you want
to learn some 10th planet Jiu Jitsu,

2973
02:51:37,081 --> 02:51:41,970
you have to go to our 10th planet, Burbank
location shoots on Burbank Boulevard.

2974
02:51:41,971 --> 02:51:44,880
What does the executor on 41
30 West Burbank Boulevard,

2975
02:51:44,910 --> 02:51:47,490
and it's a blue dragon
martial arts academy.

2976
02:51:47,700 --> 02:51:51,450
If you see the Blue Dragon martial
arts academies, so awesome tent. Yeah,

2977
02:51:51,451 --> 02:51:54,540
the big 10th planet logo right there.
But if you're driving in the street,

2978
02:51:54,541 --> 02:51:56,280
there's a white sign that like sticks out.

2979
02:51:56,520 --> 02:52:00,190
So if you find that that's what
you can learn from hedge it Bra,

2980
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:03,450
learn to get the shogun. We're going
to have a good time this weekend, man.

2981
02:52:03,451 --> 02:52:06,420
It's kind of a fun, crazy
ass. It's going to be wild.

2982
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:09,790
Fuck yeah man. Party time.
All right. You dirty bitches.

2983
02:52:09,850 --> 02:52:14,260
This has been a long and
disjointed podcast and we
apologize for it. And Brian,

2984
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:17,460
you really got to get your shit together
because you can't do any of the things

2985
02:52:17,461 --> 02:52:20,700
that you, can I make a request. Can
I make a request, Joe? Yeah, sure.

2986
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:25,270
I just dropped a new song and a,
I want to play it for you right now.

2987
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:29,560
Is it too late? I think we have
like four minutes to it and yeah,

2988
02:52:29,561 --> 02:52:33,430
we only have three hours on a recording.
Okay. You can play it afterwards.

2989
02:52:33,431 --> 02:52:35,620
We'll stop and come back out
afterwards. Okay. We'll do that.

2990
02:52:35,740 --> 02:52:40,030
So we'll stop and come back and it
will be a supplemental to the podcast.

2991

move some people around. That's a lot.

2995
02:52:58,510 --> 02:53:00,580
Might have to do honey honey
a little earlier in the day.

2996

And then next week we got Aubrey

02:53:40,320 --> 02:53:43,930
got an after party Saturday night at the
cat house at the Luxor worth the 10th

3008
02:53:43,931 --> 02:53:48,931
planet after Party after the UFC cat
house lugs or everybody's invited.

3009
02:53:49,210 --> 02:53:51,790
What is the cat house?
It's a small lounge.

3010
02:53:51,791 --> 02:53:54,600
I wanted a place where we could
get everybody in, you know?

3011
02:53:54,601 --> 02:53:58,180
And if we wouldn't have to haze or
something like excess, like those clubs,

3012
02:53:58,190 --> 02:54:01,730
you only get 10 guys in,
it gets crazy. I wanted to,

3013
02:54:01,740 --> 02:54:05,680
I put together a party where I made
sure that all my 10th planet people,

3014
02:54:05,681 --> 02:54:07,420
cause there's gonna be a bunch
of them there this weekend.

3015
02:54:07,570 --> 02:54:11,200
They get all get into one spot
without any trouble. And you know,

3016
02:54:11,201 --> 02:54:13,990
they've got a bar there, they got
music. It's just for 10 plan of family.

3017
02:54:14,250 --> 02:54:17,170
Any anybody that down, you
know, you don't have to be,

3018
02:54:17,650 --> 02:54:18,880
you don't have to go
to a 10 plan at school,

3019
02:54:18,881 --> 02:54:23,200
but it's after the UFC Saturday cat
house at the lug sore. Look for me.

3020
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:27,640
Boom bitches. Um, that's about it. Oh,

3021
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:29,500
if you're a fear factor fan,

3022
02:54:29,830 --> 02:54:34,450
the fear factor episode where we wash
shouldn't tell you what actually happens.

3023
02:54:34,810 --> 02:54:35,240
But uh,

3024
02:54:35,240 --> 02:54:40,240
there's a one two hour episode that we
filmed besides the donkey semen one that

3025
02:54:40,451 --> 02:54:42,100
won the tank in the show.

3026
02:54:42,430 --> 02:54:46,120
There's one other episode that we film
that's going to air over the next two

3027
02:54:46,121 --> 02:54:49,240
Mondays.
So I don't think they're advertising it.

3028
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:53,980
They're just sticking it in a hole
and it's called burning it off.

3029
02:54:54,010 --> 02:54:56,490
So if you're interested and
you want to check it out,

3030
02:54:56,730 --> 02:55:01,360
you'll probably never see it. A goal and
you forget about that episode. Uh, no, no.

3031
02:55:01,361 --> 02:55:04,130
I remembered, you know, I'm so happy

3032
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:06,500
that this thing turned out the way it did.
You know this,

3033
02:55:06,501 --> 02:55:07,820
it's very rare when someone,

3034
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:11,990
their show gets canceled and they're
really had big canceled. I fucked up, man.

3035
02:55:12,050 --> 02:55:15,890
I would've been a lot.
