1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,850
Her low freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:03,721
you know,

3
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:04,381
it's just wild.

4
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:04,561
I mean,

5
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:05,310
in Vietnam it's like,

6
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:05,611
everyone's like,

7
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:06,930
Vietnam is so beautiful,

8
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:07,830
you're going to love it.

9
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:08,664
And I was like,

10
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,631
yeah,

11
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:10,710
it's definitely beautiful.

12
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,120
But I see poverty and air that God,

13
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,941
no one can breathe.

14
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,610
Everyone's wearing masks
because they can't inhale.

15
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,290
There's no emissions regulations.

16
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,280
Everyone's on like,

17
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,143
I was like,

18
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,590
oh right white trust fund
kids are like Vietnam sputum.

19
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,141
And they say that,

20
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,820
cause they can come back to,

21
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,540
you know,

22
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,201
Williamsburg,

23
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,160
Brooklyn or whatever.

24
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,023
That's the thing.

25
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,880
People love talking about
Brown people being amazing.

26
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,420
It's like,

27
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:33,780
look,

28
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,920
I don't like,

29
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,670
you're not a better person because
you think Vietnam is amazing.

30
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,510
Like just admit that it's,

31
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,550
we need to,

32
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:41,970
I mean,

33
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,850
I know we fucked it up a lot of,

34
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:46,560
it's our fault of what we did in the 70s,

35
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:47,394
but it was like,

36
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,031
it was,

37
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:48,864
um,

38
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
gave me a lot of anxiety.

39
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:50,731
You know,

40
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,121
cause it was like,

41
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,320
I mean it was just like the hospitals.

42
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:52,471
I mean,

43
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,680
we were in a hospital and you know,

44
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,440
we needed four of this machine
that puts babies to sleep.

45
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,740
Pediatric anesthesia is very
different than regular anesthesia.

46
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,180
And it's essentially bringing people
to the brink of death and then bringing

47
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:06,631
them back.

48
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,280
It's like incredibly fascinating,

49
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,230
uh,

50
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,660
uh,

51
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,470
job.

52
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,270
And they had one of the machines that
they need it and knew the pediatric

53
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,081
anesthesiologists.

54
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:16,261
It's like,

55
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:16,741
we need four.

56
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,071
And they're like,

57
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,904
we don't have,

58
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,160
we just don't have them in this country.

59
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:23,070
We just can't do surgery on babies.

60
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,220
It's just not in our purview.

61
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,760
It's not,

62
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,101
oh no,

63
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:27,934
are,

64
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,441
you know,

65
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:28,741
so,

66
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:29,590
so back to,

67
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,420
to the,

68
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,781
you know,

69
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,690
the kids come in with cleft
palates and cleft lips,

70
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,280
which the baby is essentially,

71
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,900
they have trouble breastfeeding.

72
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,833
It's um,

73
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,000
and cleft palates just,

74
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:39,271
you know,

75
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:43,310
just kind of this opening here
and a separation malnutrition.

76
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,613
Uh,

77
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,540
Yup.

78
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,130
Exposure to genetics,

79
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,610
uh,

80
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,770
exposure to pollution.

81
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,610
I'm sure all that napalm we dropped
in the 70s didn't really help.

82
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,780
Uh,

83
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,591
but yeah,

84
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,450
and in America it still happens,

85
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,650
but it's handled right away.

86
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,420
It's handled,

87
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,540
it comes out three months later.

88
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,374
It's fixed.

89
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,940
No big deal over there.

90
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:03,930
Sometimes it's never fixed.

91
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:04,111
I mean,

92
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:04,831
you see adults,

93
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:07,230
you see men that are
50 come in with giant,

94
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,050
giant cleft lips and palates and they've,

95
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,630
and it's even worse in
third world countries,

96
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,660
especially African countries because
there's such a stigma attached to it.

97
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,763
Not only is it,

98
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,753
you know,

99
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,810
in our brains to go like he's different
than me and ostracized or stigmatized

100
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,051
someone,

101
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:22,231
but,

102
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,064
um,

103
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,390
a lot of more religious countries
think you're the devil or your,

104
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,313
you know,

105
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,700
you can't get a job.

106
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,300
You're completely sequester and
you're thrown out of your family.

107
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,990
And you know,

108
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,471
and I think,

109
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,420
and this is gonna sound Super Corny,

110
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,560
um,

111
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,550
but I guess for me,

112
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:38,940
I,

113
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,910
I connected so much to
maybe it's cause you know,

114
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,660
we're comedians.

115
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,493
I was like,

116
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,723
look,

117
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,560
if you,

118
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,150
it's one thing to Grub in
with their world country,

119
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,580
it's another thing to
deal with poverty and,

120
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,780
but if you can't smile,

121
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,070
like the basic,

122
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,380
the only real medicine we have,

123
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,371
you know,

124
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:57,210
everybody has,

125
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,670
and universal medicine of like laughing
and it's how we connect to people.

126
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,060
It's,

127
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,893
I mean,

128
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,190
that's fucked.

129
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,210
Like that was frustrating and a,

130
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,280
it's so easy to fix.

131
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,610
That's the other thing that's like
frustrating is it takes like 30 minutes.

132
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,810
Look at Joaquin Phoenix.

133
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,370
Look at Joaquin Phoenix.

134
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,530
You don't want to live
having anxiety issues.

135
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,341
Like why do I have that?

136
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:15,820
Why?

137
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,330
Why?

138
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:16,901
What am I afraid of?

139
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,350
You know?

140
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,160
And it's like,

141
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,341
well,

142
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,174
I'm not,

143
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,490
I'm not afraid enough to
where I'm not going to do it,

144
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,680
so let's just not make it a big,

145
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,120
not make it something I don't like.

146
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,990
Obviously I do like it.

147
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,040
That's why I'm doing track.

148
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,660
Obviously I like him and
maybe that's some of doing it.

149
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,160
I don't want to make it something I hate.

150
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,331
I don't want to make it something.

151
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,810
I don't enjoy it because
it's not rational.

152
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,510
That's not why I do this.

153
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,740
I do this because I love it,

154
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,030
so let's not make it something I,

155
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,680
I hate ever.

156
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,873
I try not to.

157
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,520
That's a very rational approach though.

158
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,820
It's very unusual for people.

159
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,061
Yeah.

160
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,590
Like there's nothing in this life.

161
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,700
Like if I want to do it,

162
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,990
that fears going to stop me.

163
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,750
Fears are realistic thing.

164
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,391
It happens.

165
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:49,571
Yeah.

166
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,740
It's scary to get into the cage.

167
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,080
It's scary to think
about losing w you know,

168
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:57,460
and I've tasted the most bitter losses
you could ever dream of and it's

169
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,360
devastating.

170
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,260
It's crushing.

171
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,760
That's the most scary thing.

172
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,870
It's not getting beat up.

173
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,250
It's not breaking your nose or breaking
my orbital bone or letting my arm gets

174
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:06,970
snapped in half.

175
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,730
That's not the scary part
about fighting and what I do.

176
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,300
The scary part is not
being adequate enough,

177
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,110
not being good enough that
you're 100% wasn't good enough.

178
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,460
That's scary.

179
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,810
That's really scary.

180
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,220
And um,

181
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,211
I've had that,

182
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,480
I've had to face that point blank
right in the face many times before.

183
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,340
And it's the hardest thing to do.

184
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,781
Bar none.

185
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:30,430
It's the hardest thing to
look at yourself and be like,

186
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,323
I didn't,

187
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,260
I wasn't enough.

188
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,460
I wasn't enough.

189
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,830
No one else can be responsible for that.

190
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,770
I fucked up.

191
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,340
I didn't do it.

192
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,173
I have to own this.

193
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,740
And to come back from something like
that and think that you can still,

194
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,860
you can still get it back or you can
still do it again or you could still get

195
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:45,101
better.

196
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,000
You can learn from that.

197
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,960
That's,

198
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,670
that's also the challenging part of it,

199
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,181
you know,

200
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,200
and that's something that I've,

201
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,760
I've had to,

202
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,720
to get to this point,

203
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,930
I've had to get over those situations
where I thought that my world had ended.

204
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,481
You know,

205
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,180
my second loss to Rhonda
was the most devastating.

206
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,440
The first loss was devastating.

207
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:04,140
The second loss was ah,

208
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,950
like it was horrible.

209
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,060
I thought my world was,

210
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,500
was coming to an end and you know,

211
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,690
nobody cared about my family and friends,

212
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:11,920
but the rest of world,

213
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,330
they don't care.

214
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:12,790
I don't give a shit.

215
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,870
They don't care about second place.

216
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,830
They don't care,

217
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,580
you know.

218
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,390
And um,

219
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,170
they're mean.

220
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,130
People are harsh.

221
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,730
They're mean on social media you have to
get thick skin quick and nobody teaches

222
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:22,810
you how to deal with that either.

223
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,400
There's no MMA,

224
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,770
social media one on one or like you don't,

225
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,760
you just sink or swim.

226
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,370
You figure it out or you don't
either bothers you or it doesn't,

227
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,881
you know,

228
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,070
either you yell back at
everyone or you don't.

229
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,250
Speaking of getting there,

230
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,600
I tried to watch soccer last night.

231
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:35,841
He,

232
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,310
and I was going to bring that up.

233
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,760
People tweeted me that you're watching
soccer to a game on Sunday at the

234
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,080
mother's Day.

235
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,570
Mother's Day.

236
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,781
Oh,

237
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:46,500
shit happened.

238
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,880
All right.

239
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,713
I can't do it.

240
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,310
Oh yeah.

241
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,041
What happened?

242
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:49,850
Why?

243
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,300
Well,

244
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,950
it was at the store and uh,

245
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,320
we were hanging out in
the secret comedians bar

246
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,080
and soccer was on,

247
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,520
so we just started watching it.

248
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,920
Just started watching that show.

249
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,770
Who had that on?

250
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,970
Ryan White was watching it.

251
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:02,804
I was watching it.

252
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,540
Some of the employees were watching it,

253
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,870
you know,

254
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,240
um,

255
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,260
who else was in there with us?

256
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,700
Tony was watching at one point,

257
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,890
but I started getting upset if these
dudes getting slapped and going down like

258
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,250
that get hit with a meteor.

259
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,720
I didn't like that.

260
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,740
I'm like,

261
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,960
I just can't support
this kind of nonsense.

262
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,340
You were watching a really good game.

263
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,180
Yeah.

264
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,590
You're really watching a really good game.

265
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,011
Yeah.

266
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,731
It was amazing.

267
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,010
Like skill wise by Munich and the red,

268
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,300
they're the best German team and
this is a champion's league game,

269
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,490
so I didn't know how to explain it.

270
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,660
Champions League is square,

271
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,100
the four best teams in each
league in each country.

272
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,120
Like playing a tournament to,

273
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,780
to be the best club team in Europe.

274
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,580
So Byron is,

275
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,890
is like the number one team in Germany.

276
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,660
Athletical they like number two,

277
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:48,980
number three right now.

278
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,910
That actually in number,

279
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,110
the number two spot right now.

280
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,730
But last year they finished maybe
second or third at the end there,

281
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,770
they have less money but their coaches
are ex Argentina player and he figured

282
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,670
out a system where they just hustle,

283
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,960
they just out hustle you,

284
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,260
you get the ball and there's three
motherfuckers on you and you're going to

285
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,580
cough it up and they're going to get it.

286
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,150
And they will score a one or two
goals a game and that's enough.

287
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,570
But you know and buying is just so really
skilled that they might be able to,

288
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,210
they beat most teams but athletics
is just so disciplined that you know,

289
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
they knocked them out and,

290
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,960
and they're,

291
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,160
they're going to the Champions
League final versus Real Madrid.

292
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,270
So there's two Spanish teams
in the champion's league
final and both of them are

293
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,140
from the same city.

294
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,800
So it's like the Lakers versus
the clippers for like the best.

295
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,470
The championship of what?

296
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,550
W W what?

297
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,721
What are we in?

298
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,400
Like the up North America.

299
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,350
We're going to do a some soccer games.

300
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:48,651
Man.

301
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,420
You're going to owe you
the world of soccer.

302
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,051
Oh yeah.

303
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,250
He's going to introduce it to me.

304
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,361
Let me know.

305
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,320
It's very exciting.

306
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,280
It's fun.

307
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,821
It's funny though.

308
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:56,750
I know what you're going to do.

309
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,190
What am I going to come?

310
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,900
And then you're going to talk shit.

311
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,150
You're going to transcode.

312
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,020
Well,

313
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,310
I'll tell you why you people,

314
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,061
I'm telling you right now,

315
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,860
you go start falling down
when people slap you.

316
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,340
Nope.

317
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,270
Nobody likes that.

318
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,750
Nobody.

319
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,411
Nobody likes.

320
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:10,340
They shouldn't do it.

321
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,181
You shouldn't do it.

322
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,620
It's an MBA now too.

323
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,000
He's in the NBA now.

324
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,580
I don't want to hear this shitty like I,

325
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,840
I've never liked it.

326
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,070
But people do it to get the free kick or
the penalty or to get the other person

327
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,820
sent off.

328
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,900
It's become a part of the game.

329
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:24,734
It's unfortunate.

330
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,560
So let's just get that out the way
before you come because that's,

331
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,311
you're going to see that.

332
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,960
But besides that,

333
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,361
it's,

334
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:30,810
it's a,

335
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,940
it's a man's game.

336
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,361
Yeah.

337
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:32,630
I mean,

338
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,470
get the fuck out of here.

339
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,810
When Raquel Pennington choked out,

340
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,141
Ashley,

341
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,250
Evan Smith Blood was pouring down her
face and she strangled or unconscious with

342
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,530
one second to go with a bulldog
choke in the first round.

343
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,550
That's a girl,

344
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,590
135 pound girl,

345
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,990
and you get smacked of
running down the field.

346
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:48,430
Like,

347
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,010
oh,

348
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,900
this is bullshit.

349
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:50,260
Fall.

350
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
They hold their mouth.

351
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,910
They roll around like a baby.

352
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,161
Yeah.

353
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:53,751
And women.

354
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,850
And when you watch women's soccer,

355
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,010
women don't do that.

356
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,600
Women don't do that.

357
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:00,510
Women do not take dies and get smashed.

358
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,800
Someone needs to start a campaign.

359
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,180
Maybe we can help him.

360
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:12,570
Okay.
