1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,760
Great overlap. Do you drink?
Do you want to zero alcohol?

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,260
Caniquan sure. If you have it. One.
Yeah. There you go. Phil. Zero alcohol.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:14,230
Let's get crazy. Excellent pace
ourselves. She takes cheers, sir.

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm going chug this. Whoa. Don't do not
get to that too dangerous. Zero alcohol.

5
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,980
How many calories though? We scare
calories, Bro. You stay alive.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,540
That's trying to get plenty of
calories already. I have to ask you,

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:32,490
did you drive it in the Hemi? No, I
didn't. I got dropped off in a Chevy.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,630
Oh my God. This is outrageous.
I had one for a little while.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,710
It's just a little while.
Yeah,

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,130
I figure like you would have to have one
for quite a long time. It was fun. Well,

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,190
okay, I'm going to backtrack a little
bit. So first commercial, right, that,

12
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,470
thank God I hear me right.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,280
I did six of these things and
around commercial three I,

14
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,800
uh, I was talking to my agent
and I said, man, you know,

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,270
if they ask you to do another
one, oh shit. Here we go. Yeah.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,230
That's the worst I've
ever looked at my life.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,200
I really felt like I was sitting in a
desert like no one's ever going to see

18
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,870
these commercials, and I wasn't going
to know what a Hammy is incorrect.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,480
I could not have been more
wrong. Yeah, there it is.

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,850
Look at that bad.
I asked you,

21
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:20,130
did they give you one or did you just go
out and buy one? Well, I said, listen,

22
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:22,410
if they,
if they want me to do another commercial,

23
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:26,190
see if you can get a vehicle out of them.
Right in. My agent was like, you know,

24
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:29,160
make it their problem. He calls him up. He
goes, hey, I don't know if you know this,

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,600
but your Hamy Guy,

26
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,500
your spokesman is driving
around Los Angeles right now
and a Suzuki sidekick. Oh.

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,780
And they're like,
what's my name is

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,410
not the fucking die.
So at the same thing,

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,960
it's the lightest.
It's a box Skype.

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,350
If you could put a string to it
and float it in the years that,

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,270
that shitty looking jeep thing. Yes. Oh
Wow. You have one of those? I did read.

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,310
I don't know why.
For some reason I liked that thing.

33
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,180
I've got it in college and
as my way like it. Yeah.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,550
It was cool for a tailgating and
shit. There it is. Yeah, that's,

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,100
that's the ll cool j versus, I
didn't have that one. Let's see. No,

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,360
I think I saw that in a video one time
cause that's, that's the one I had. Right.

37
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,700
You've got that hard top. Damn. Yeah.

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,600
I had total that thing in North
Dakota one time hit black ice.

39
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,190
I mean a gust of wind just knocked
me off the road and I was in a ditch,

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,160
but it was, uh, you know
how people in motorcycles,

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,960
they'll see another
motorcycle and they'll wave.

42
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,440
It's like a little club that
you're in and jeeps do it too.

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,580
And I started doing that to others who
Zukie sidekicks and out of port for a

44
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:39,300
reason, I'd wave to them nine times out
of 10. It's like a overweight black lady.

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,030
And I just went with that and I'm
like, what does he do it? I was like,

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,980
we're in the club man. So, but yeah, uh,

47
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,970
people like Nice cars, but to do that
with shitty cars too. Yeah. That's what,

48
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,750
that's the next level that's more fun.
Like I see you,

49
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,940
did they give you when they give
you a hemming? It was a, uh, uh,

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,140
1500 dodge ram quad cab black lot of
chrome feel comfortable on it then I loved

51
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:07,530
it. I loved when I first got it. You know,
it's like, it's like in the middle of,

52
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,070
you know,
I did six of those commercials.

53
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,270
So as ride around La with the windows
down, just blasting, you know,

54
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:17,980
Leonard Skinner and shit. Yeah.
The comedy store and like park it,

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,650
I made, they hated park in that
thing and that then that lot,

56
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,890
because it's gigantic, it's a
wide and they're like, really man,

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,600
can you just have somebody drop you off?
Brendan chavs been showing up in his, uh,

58
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,740
he got a raptor.
Oh yeah.

59
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,600
Realize how wide those things are
until he's standing in front of him.

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,640
Like huge as a fucking giant vehicle
and then trying to valet that thing

61
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,650
anywhere in Los Angeles.
You know,

62
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,680
it's a lot of tiny little Mexican
dudes are like, really man.

63
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,590
Well the worst is if you
try to valet a stick shift.

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,060
I tried to give a valley my keys to my
bronco and he didn't know what to do.

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,670
I go, you don't know how to drive
a stick shift. He goes, no. I go,

66
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:55,450
what the fuck are you doing here man?
How can you have this job? Yeah. Yeah.

67
00:03:55,451 --> 00:04:00,400
That should be a part of the a resume.
I can't drive all cars. It's crazy.

68
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,740
Yeah. My, I don't think most
people know how to, you know,

69
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,880
and do what an under 30 could drive
a stick. I don't think so. No.

70
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,270
Going into is going gone. Yeah.
Porsche doesn't make them any more.

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,620
The only American muscle cars were one
of the last holdouts like corvette and

72
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:19,130
Camaro. I haven't driven a stick
in a long time mustangs. You know,

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,580
you want to try? Sure. Today
actually, the last time I did,

74
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:25,990
I was in Costa Rica and I rented,
I rented a car and I'm like,

75
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,040
I just assume all cars now when you
rent them are automatics. You know,

76
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,960
you get to know the country. It's, it's
what ever, and so I'm pulling out of the,

77
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:39,910
uh, the lot and it's like, oh shit. It's
been admitted. It was pretty embarrassing.

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,760
I got this. Yeah. When you're in
Italy, they all drive stick shifts.

79
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,630
Even like minivans. Yeah.
It's weird. Yeah. Everything's
a stick shift over there.

80
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,050
I'm not sure why. I don't know. What,
what's the advantages and disadvantages?

81
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:56,830
I mean, what do you prefer? Well,
if I was in where I was in Italy,

82
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:00,940
it was in Ravello,
which is a very small little roads.

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,070
It's very tiny and it's like
crazy congestion because
of tourism. Yeah. And uh,

84
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,020
the guy was always on the clutch back and
forth, back and forth. I was like, yeah,

85
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,820
this is, you gotta be annoying as fuck.
You'd be having automatic just like La,

86
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,630
right? Like if you're in,
if you're commuting to la
bumper to bumper every day,

87
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,710
you're going to want an automatic
exact, that's what happened, right?

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
I think you're right. Yeah. Yeah.

89
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,120
It's just more comfortable
lip lift the car to the work.

90
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,560
But if you're on a mountain road,
like the angel's Crest Highway,

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,920
Oh yeah.
You want to shift.

92
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:35,980
There's something cool about being in
command of the vehicle and you killing it

93
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,620
when it's manly. Yeah. It is,

94
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,270
and he got a dick in your hand and
if it's a woman, I've got to go, Ooh,

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,990
don't get too close to this one. Yeah.
She likes driving stick shifts like, well,

96
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,200
she's a rebel.
Right.

97
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,870
She might be great in bed
maybe. Yeah. For a little while.

98
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,040
And then I didn't bring her house.
She gets mad at you for email for 12

99
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,670
years ago.
I didn't even know you that what the fuck?

100
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,850
I can't go back and find this. Where's
that phone come from? That's a flip phone.

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,820
Zukie sidekick. We were looking at
that thing from ces at Jamie pulled up.

102
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,410
What does that goofy thing called?
These are good, right? I'll really,

103
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,900
I don't feel like I'm drinking
a nonalcoholic, it tastes
like a regular beer. Um,

104
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,120
planet computers. Cosmo
communicator, which is like,

105
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:30,040
it's outside of thing that is,
that is wasted.

106
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,090
Someone was doing coke and they decided,
is that having a space ship? It does.

107
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,020
It looks at it lucky. These has a planet
or a spaceship on the front of it.

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,160
It looks like one of those metal wallets
that you get to keep your credit cards.

109
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,950
Yeah. But that shit is
preposterous. Missing your fingers.

110
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,210
Who makes that fat? Fucking hands am
not going to fit on that thing. Yeah.

111
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,180
He's not going to be able to do that at
this point. We're so used to doing this.

112
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:03,710
Why go back and go to back to that now?
Do you ever go sideways in your iPhone?

113
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,240
Uh, yeah. Just to take a picture.
Yeah, but never a typing. No Way.

114
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,090
I thought that was the move. I'm
like, oh, once we go sideways,

115
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:15,860
that's going to be the shit.
Have you tried on an iPad?
Uh, have not. It's not bad.

116
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,250
Yeah. Sideways. Yeah. Like when you
have to type on the full screen,

117
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,430
the full cohort of hands. Not
Bad. Yeah. It's not perfect,

118
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:25,640
but it's way better than just your thumbs
on an iPhone. Yeah, that makes sense.

119
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,640
Especially if you can type, I used to
think I would never get used to that.

120
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,480
Just that you know the, the,
the screen without feeling it.

121
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,070
Look at that little front screen.

122
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,990
Like you've got a bunch of
shit that comes in on it.

123
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,070
Look at that whole like apps and
stuff. I guess. Boy that's going to,

124
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,110
no one's buying that song. How am
I gonna do that thing? How much is,

125
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,610
there are so many options now.

126
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:50,120
If you don't like apple and you're
committed to like an android phone,

127
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,300
there's so many options. Why
would you buy that thing? What?

128
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,580
I don't even know what
companies that whom exactly.

129
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,730
That's also part of the problem,
right? Yeah. That'll be gone.

130
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,470
Like where do you bring that
thing to get it fixed? Yeah.

131
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,000
If the screen cracks and you bring
it to the mall, what is it? Yeah,

132
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,510
the cosmo communicated,
Bro.

133
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm going to have to go to the
future and fix this thing. Yeah.

134
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:11,600
We can't do this in 10 minutes.
This thing's a mess. I mean,

135
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:16,100
I got a cracked screen now and you know,
it's not even that bad,

136
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,000
but I've seen people walk around with
like damn spiderweb on their phone.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,960
I'm like, when are you going to
go get it fixed? What's the point?

138
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,760
It's the glass was falling off.

139
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,720
This is an indication of you needed to
get your shit together. Yeah, that's true.

140
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,790
Yeah. If your phone looks like a like
a haunted house. That's a good one.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,030
Yeah. Let's go into like, uh, you know,
see if those girls going to be crazy.

142
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,570
How cracked is her screen? That's a
good point. Like gimme your phone,

143
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,070
like a girl who can deal with a little
crack. That's probably the, okay.

144
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,660
She's cool. Just a little crack in
the window in the corner. No big deal.

145
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,080
It'll fine. She doesn't give
a fuck. She's easy going.

146
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,850
She doesn't even need to wear makeup bro.

147
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,720
You know what if he's had to do like
this and get the light just right cause

148
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,840
it's like a dam.
It's a full [inaudible] get tea

149
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,990
because that part of the glass won't work.

150
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,690
What about the other way they're
going with the flex phone?

151
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,580
Because this isn't the one that broke,

152
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:13,230
but this is another one that came out at
ces to that they'd read called Samsung

153
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,420
recalled the ones, I suppose they
were called all of them. Huh?

154
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,950
They'd unreleased date.
Now they're not going to,

155
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,960
who knows when they're to come
out and they break in like crazy.

156
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:22,850
Apparently flex phone. Is
it flexible bins? Yeah.

157
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,450
But how does that one work? All I'm seeing
is like, yeah, opened up video of that.

158
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,210
Yeah. The Samsung one had
like a little teeny, uh,

159
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,570
I don't know if you look online in the
each slash aquarium that we put sea

160
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,900
monkeys in, it does, right? It
looks like one of them ones.

161
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,330
It's like a pillar and a shitty hotel

162
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,870
in Miami or somewhere by full for hours.
Someone needs to clean the tank.

163
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,480
They have a waterway,

164
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:55,050
has a flexible and it looks way
better than the Samsung one.

165
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,850
It looks thinner and it looks like they
just nailed the design better and on the

166
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:04,570
side of it. What's it? Yeah, it's
a different car. I don't know. No,

167
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,180
no, no. Sorry. Royale Flex Pie beat
Samsung. And why wait? A market sells out.

168
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,110
That's what this one was folded.
Folded in half. Yeah. Yeah. They're,

169
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:18,510
they're making these things where you
can flex them and bend them like a

170
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,530
thousand times. Oh, how
weird. Yeah. That's weird.

171
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,840
How am I supposed to fat? That
thing is, that's like Karen,

172
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:28,710
a VHS tape in your pocket. Right. I mean,

173
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,310
I'm trying to imagine the advantages and
disadvantages of watching porn on that

174
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,090
thing. Oh, there's advantages. Yeah.

175
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,170
Cause like Lassi your ass and then you
got to turn your phone upside down.

176
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,960
That's pretty wild how it
works. That is eight. Yeah.

177
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,320
Well kind of hoping it works so that
the version three or four in a couple of

178
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,830
years, it's way better than
these broken ones. Well for sure.

179
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,250
You're going to see people
at concerts holding a blue,

180
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,190
it looks like 12 inch iPads because it's
going to be these goddamn things in the

181
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:58,830
future. I've seen that before. Now

182
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,830
would you do that? Because they're
assholes. Yeah. They're everywhere.

183
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,360
I mean you're right. Yeah. I hate
it. Especially like a comedy show.

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,360
It's like the, the
phones bad enough. I pad,

185
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,460
I have a Tesla and uh,
the Tesla has this huge screen.

186
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,710
Right. It's enormous. Yeah. Yeah.
And you get so used to it. Yeah.

187
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,200
So I go from that to another car with a
little tiny navigation screen like that.

188
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,690
Is this bullshit? Yeah. It's funny
how you get used to things. It's like,

189
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:31,980
I'd rather have a Thomas Guide when I
first did you have on those and he came to

190
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,290
la. God, he had to pull
over every five feet.

191
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,470
Bill Burr had one of those
as recently as 2011 wow.

192
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,900
Came to my house. I really came
to my house in his fucking Prius.

193
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:43,800
He still has a Prius.

194
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:47,820
That asshole that's probably got $1
billion is going to fuck it. Prius.

195
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,500
He pulls into my driveway and a, I see
the Thomas Guide is backseat. He's like,

196
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:55,780
yeah, those that navigation
shit with that goes down.

197
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,080
You can't figure your way around town.
Yeah. You're lost up in the hills.

198
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:02,650
No connection. The Thomas Guy Works
every time I knew how to do it, man.

199
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:05,620
I get back in the day.
Oh Ie 10 I know how to do that.

200
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,650
You go eat 10 that's why I
need to go write it down.

201
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,720
And that was always dangerous.
Fuck up.

202
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,720
And all of a sudden you're
in a Mexican community.

203
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,600
Chickens or run across this street.
Sounds great.

204
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,260
Is Sun Valley sketch never been to
Sun Valley? I think it is. Yeah.

205
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,010
There's lots of, I'd been there once.
I got to think I got lost. I was like,

206
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:33,580
this is, this is not. So when you got
rid of your Hemi, did you say, hey,

207
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:38,380
this is from the Hemi guy,
like this should be worth
some money? Oh well it was,

208
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:42,490
I thought a kid like auction
at all. Yeah, on Ebay.

209
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,070
Like I took pictures with it and
everything. It didn't work. It was like,

210
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,620
I think it was when gas was at its
highest price and paper. Like no,

211
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:53,290
I think we're moving on to other things.
So fucking high,

212
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,930
no it's closing in on
five bucks a gallon again.

213
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,750
But I had it for about two years.
Once you get rid of it.

214
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,980
Well I was married at the time and that
thing was hard when I would leave and

215
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:09,940
she'd had that car.
It was just hard to back into the,

216
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,620
the garage or any,

217
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:16,120
we have a small two door to two car garage
and it was hard to get that thing in

218
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:19,360
there. And so she, she, she
convinced me that we didn't need it.

219
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,960
We leased a Lexus Rx rx three 50 for
awhile. Those are dope. I liked them.

220
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,050
I like it when you drive it like
the backup camera and those things.

221
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,150
That's very nice.
Yeah.

222
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,770
We drive a truck and then you get into
a little car like that. You're like,

223
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,410
oh yeah. I was like a dancer, right?

224
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,080
Yeah.
What was your first car?

225
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,190
My first car was a 1973 Chevelle Chevelle,
s.

226
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,020
S it was a shitbox.

227
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,490
I drove it from the guy's house to
my house and then it died. It never,

228
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,960
it never worked again.
I take,

229
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:57,100
I drove to my girlfriend's house and
then I drove back to my house and then it

230
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:00,160
died, and then I called the guy up,
my hand, me your fucking car died.

231
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,200
He came and gave it. He gave me the
money back and took his car. He said,

232
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:08,950
what happened to my car? I'm like,
a died. Just doesn't work. Wow.

233
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,530
Like a day. I had it for a
day and then my was horrible.

234
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:14,681
Yeah.

235
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:19,540
Then I had a 1968 four four two that
are wrapped around a telephone pole.

236
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,540
Oh Shit. Yeah. Whoops.
Hydroplaned yeah. Yeah.

237
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,120
If you didn't know how to drive back
then and you had to like kind of balding

238
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,820
tires. Yeah. And you hit some water. Yeah.

239
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,790
Cars would just go sideways
and you know what is this like?

240
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,340
You're floating in there. Yeah.
It's crazy. It's a crazy feeling.

241
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,170
You can't do anything about it.
Nothing about it.

242
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,170
They always tell you to turn
until it nothing's happening.

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,050
I was just going sideways. I was
like, I can't believe this shit.

244
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:43,830
I just got this car. I had that
one for a few months and then bang,

245
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,400
fucked that one up. Just hydro
planning. Just hung by yourself. No,

246
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,920
I was with a couple of guys from a school.
He might get hurt. No, we're all right,

247
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,810
but it fucked the car up. I was in
a fee era member fee arrow. Yeah.

248
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,870
My sister had one of those. It's like
a little key chain Ferrari. Yeah.

249
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,860
Remember they used to do so small. These
are do Ferrari kits for those. Yes.

250
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:07,460
It turned into a fake Testarossa.
Yeah. Put a car on there.

251
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,060
Yeah. Those were, those were interesting.
My friend Joe had with those two.

252
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:15,230
Those were cool little cars.
Jim Carr, right back in the day.

253
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,580
It was like either in my
hometown. It was like, it is

254
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,230
ridiculous car. Great.
Then this is adorable.

255
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,300
Those cars are so gross when people do
that. Yeah. And it's obvious what's like,

256
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:33,380
what do you, no one wants that once
you get is that one that can't that

257
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,710
great job. That's crazy. That one actually
looks good. Yeah. What kind of tricks?

258
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,620
I'm really dumb girls with that.
You go to Miami,

259
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,780
you let me see your cell
phone or the really dumb ones.

260
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,710
Like if that's like, if you were only
looking for really dumb gals. Yeah.

261
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,890
That's your car. Dumb gold
diggers. Those louvers. What is,

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,560
what does that in the back?
Yeah. It looks like, yeah.

263
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,790
It's probably a plastic rear window.
Oh my God.

264
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,560
They make some cars with plastic windows
just to save weight. Okay. Relax.

265
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,700
Relax with that. Yeah. We,
uh, my buddy and I, he,

266
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,400
he had one of those, we hydroplaned
spun around a couple of times,

267
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,361
totaled it,

268
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:22,361
hit another car that was parked at a
body shop and they had just finished it.

269
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,420
He's like, cool. Uh, I
guess I'm doing two cars

270
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,330
fixed. Totaled by slamming into a car that
was just finished at a body shop. Yeah.

271
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,430
It was a Sarah Uber is that guy's friend.

272
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,950
Get on Uber. Yeah. I love Uber. I wonder
how much that's preventing drunk driving.

273
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,900
I just had this conversation.
Yeah.

274
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,820
I think what mothers against
drunk driving mad, you know,

275
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,730
maybe even the government should like
kick in. You'd be like, you know,

276
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:59,410
these guys are saving lives.
Yeah. For sure. If you get,

277
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,260
cause if you're not doing that, then
you're drinking and driving most likely,

278
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,800
most likely. So it gives you
a real easy option. Yeah.

279
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,850
And it's so quick. It's so convenient.
You don't have to pull cash out. It's,

280
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,020
it's great. It's kind of a weird
organization of both of them.

281
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:19,460
It's like they're trying to figure out
if their employees or their contractors

282
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,840
and then there's like this fact that
you're just getting into someone's car.

283
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,470
You don't know them. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean you assume that if you get a limo,

284
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,160
but there's a background check, right?
If you get a cab, you living on the edge.

285
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,970
Right. That's how I was going to
say. If he never know Robert De Niro,

286
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,550
you look at me. Yeah, we're not talking
about a fucking psychopath. Right.

287
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,100
That's what you like. But you will get
caught like New York City cab drivers,

288
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:48,101
you'd get characters and you get either
like a angry white dudes or like a guys

289
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,020
who come from other countries. I
can tell you cool stories. Yeah,

290
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,680
you get like characters,
weird smells and shit crazy smells,

291
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,830
lots of weird music but
possibly a Voodoo doll.

292
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,560
But now you know what you get when
you get in New York City cab driver,

293
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:05,750
you get advertisements and you'd screens
like they have little laptops facing

294
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,770
and the play these these credit card
machine back there and they play these,

295
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
these videos about things
about restaurants and this
and that shows that it's

296
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,920
its own network at this point.
Yeah, like just the cab network.

297
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,440
It is kind of right. It must be, but yeah,

298
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,470
I've seen that the copy has their own
little loop that they plugged Jimmy Fallon

299
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,560
and I mean I've seen him down
there many times doing stuff.

300
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,880
I remember they used to do the HBO
show Taxi Cab Confessions. Yeah.

301
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,870
That was crazy. I enjoyed
that. I was like, who the
fuck is signing this release?

302
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,550
What are you giving these people?
Like I just want to be on TV.

303
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,200
And I would say the worst stuff.

304
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,430
Like if you're fucked up on coke and
you get into a a cab and you start just

305
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:51,940
talking shit about all the crazy
sexual stuff that you like. And then,

306
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,420
and then afterwards they're like, hey,
you're going to be on HBO. You're like,

307
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,480
fuck yeah, I am inside that thing.
And then you wake up in the morning.

308
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,820
That's true. We'll call this, uh,

309
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,330
this waiver at the right time. Yeah.
That's gold. That's a good move.

310
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,590
How does that work? Does that
count? If you're hammered?

311
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,780
I, there's gotta be some loophole.
I always wondered about that. Um,

312
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,500
the catch a Predator show. Yeah.
Why the fuck would they sign it?

313
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,060
They have to sign a release.
Do they? Yes. Or cops.

314
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,140
They have to sign a release. Yeah.
You have to sign a release. So yeah.

315
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,320
And then there's like the, is it
entrapment and even, you know,

316
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,140
there was that whole thing too.
Well that show's definitely entrapment,

317
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,270
but it's entrapment. I support.
Yeah, totally. I supporting
Trapman if it's like,

318
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,950
Hey, do you want to fuck a six year
old? And they're like, Yo, do okay.

319
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,990
Get in the cage fucking piece
of shit. That's right. Yeah.

320
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:50,991
This is starting to trap me in the hall
for you in a fucking anybody under 18.

321
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,990
Right.
Or how do they get away with that?

322
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,850
How do they get them showing their face?
Maybe because they were proven guilty.

323
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,960
You waived your rights, but just by being
guilty, you have no rights when you're,

324
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,840
I don't fell it. Right. Thank you. And
you're selling, you have no rights.

325
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:11,490
Is that right? Well, you
have rights. Bernie Sanders
wants you to be able to vote,

326
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:14,470
even if you're a terrorist. If
you've seen that, he's like, yeah,

327
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,550
anybody in jail for anything. He's was
like, you should still be able to vote.

328
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,480
Like, whoa. Okay. I don't know. There's
a lot of people in jail. That's true.

329
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,110
What if they count as residents
of the state? Like it have.

330
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:28,650
You have like a maximum security
prison somewhere. Right?

331
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:32,820
And these prisoners have everything
like they have all day, right? Yeah.

332
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
Then what I need to do, and they
registered to vote while they're in there.

333
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,510
If you have a few hundred
thousand prisoners, yeah.

334
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
You literally can shift an election
one way or the other. That's true.

335
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,320
All you'd have to do is get
into that prison and go, hey
guys, here's the deal. Um,

336
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,410
I'm, I'm for shortening your
fucking sentences. Okay? Yeah.

337
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:53,500
I'm forgetting you better lawyers. People
would start campaigning and prisons.

338
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,490
That's legit, man. Yeah.

339
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:59,020
Like these laws are bullshit and you
can bribe him real easy with the little

340
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,260
ketchup. Cigarettes.
Cigarette, bring in cigarettes,

341
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,450
trucking cartons of cigarettes. How did
you win this election? Marlboro reds.

342
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,360
What's that guy's name? Booted.
Judge. Judge. Judge, what's his name?

343
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,530
How do you say his name? Tulsi.
Gabbers my girl. I'm voting for her.

344
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:18,130
I decided I liked her. I met her in
person cause it, I don't know. I give up.

345
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,700
I give up and not paying attention.
Anything else? Telson Gabbert uh,

346
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,740
but um, if you could go into
a prison, like what is a,

347
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,630
what's a B? What's a giant prison
population? What's the biggest,

348
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:35,780
biggest one? I don't know. We think
the biggest one is the biggest one. Uh,

349
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,850
I don't know if it be in New
York, California. There was
not what? It isn't there?

350
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:42,660
A giant one in Colorado that Joey
was talking about. There's a,

351
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,070
they take the serial killers.
They stopped him on the ground.

352
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,300
Like what is the, that, what's the
biggest one? Uh, 2004 he looks at, okay.

353
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,810
Did you say 50,000 prisoners?
I don't know much about that.

354
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,490
That's probably a lot of people think
about spread up all Rina, right?

355
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah, that's true. Okay. Well No.
Okay. 50 60,000 the biggest one.

356
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,240
The biggest? Yeah. What's
the smile? It's, well,

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,900
it was probably some Odin
rinky dinky mass, but a bit,
I'm not gonna stay in jail.

358
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,390
No. Yeah, I'm going to
say a little lighter.

359
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,930
I'm going to say thirty thousand
thirty thousand the biggest,

360
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,980
they put money on this. I'll put a
dollar on this. I don't give a fuck, bro.

361
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,080
I'll put, I'll bet you a Heineken double
zero shit. We got too rich for my blood.

362
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,980
What do we got?
Jimmy's confused.

363
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,880
I have to be very specific about
what I look up to find the answer.

364
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,170
So do you want largest maximum
security? Sure. Yeah. Killers.

365
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,160
Not people who smoke weed
known as Alcatraz of the south.

366
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,930
The Louisiana state penitentiary.

367
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:51,400
We go has it inmate
population of 5,000 that's it.

368
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,750
Damn. That's maximum
security. So like criminals,

369
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,610
if you go a little bit less than it
might be a little bit higher, but okay,

370
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,630
let's go with thieves.

371
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:07,290
Let's go with a medium security
or maximum is like violent prison.

372
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,370
Yeah, the biggest prison. The largest
prison. That's one thing that popped up.

373
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,940
Give maybe we're way off 5,000
is a lot because it looks bigger.

374
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,640
The X and Florence supermax prison,
there's one old supermax prison.

375
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,280
That's the one I think you're
talking about. It's even higher,

376
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,310
but that would probably have way less
people trying to see if it says, oh,

377
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,380
that's even higher criminal level.

378
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,300
That was like where they put the ice 23
hours a day. Tom Single cell confinement.

379
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,063
Um,

380
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,070
5,000 is a lot of people can find me
as so weird cause like we're just,

381
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:44,110
we're killing you,
but we're just killing you with nature.

382
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,840
We're going to kill you with
old and shitty nutrition
and just can keep you on a

383
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:50,390
box with your own brain and that weird.
Yeah.

384
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,440
It's like it might be more cruel to put
someone into a small cage for 23 hours a

385
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:59,420
day. Then instead to just killed him? I
think so, yeah. Have you just kill you?

386
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:04,400
It's over with. Yeah. And
you're saying it's suffering?
Yeah, hundred percent yeah.

387
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,800
100%. Like that was uh, my, my take on uh,

388
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,760
Chelsea manning who's now free. Yeah.
Like they tortured her. They tortured.

389
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:14,401
They did?
Yeah.

390
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:18,980
She was naked in a cage
by herself for years.

391
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,900
I think it was like the,

392
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,170
the hole she was in solitary
when I have to find the sound.

393
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,310
Once Jamie's telling with this search,

394
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,710
I'm like looking around as a,

395
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,350
the one in California has male only
where Manson is, it's got 3,500.

396
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:33,620
There's one in Illinois, medium
security. It's got a thousand.

397
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,760
Okay.
So we're way off by a factor.

398
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,250
So pessimistic thought it was going
low and I was off by a factor of 10.

399
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,143
I don't know if it's

400
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,600
counting then too. There's private ones
and I don't know if I can get the numbers

401
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,550
private, those dirty bastards
stuff. I mean on top of each other.

402
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:48,900
It's called the ones make sense.

403
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:53,550
If there were 30,000 inmates in one place,
a man,

404
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:56,130
it would be hard to contain
that and control that. Yeah.

405
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:59,640
What's the largest
private prisons if that's,

406
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,360
yeah, so, but the Chelsea manning thing,

407
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,770
she was in solitary confinement
when she was still a Duke.

408
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,900
Does that count like a,

409
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:13,470
as her being like kind of two different
studies say that you say Bradley or do

410
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:17,970
you see Chelsea when she hadn't
changed yet? I think we have to ask,

411
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:20,730
can you still say Bruce Jenner won
the Olympics or did you say Katelyn?

412
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,080
Well Bruce, when they limpic
no, no, no. Kaitlin. What
does it say? He's Caitlyn now.

413
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:27,180
You can't get it now.
You know if you dead name him,

414
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:30,540
you'll get kicked off of Twitter. Dead
naming. Do you know the dead naming is no,

415
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:34,920
I never heard of it. You didn't know.
So say if you become Joe Honda a reap,

416
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,410
if you decided at this stage of the game,
you know what?

417
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,880
Fuck hammies and transitions. Yeah, I'm,
I'm, I'm wearing time for Prius. Yeah,

418
00:25:41,881 --> 00:25:43,920
it was time to get my legs
waxed. The, what do we got?

419
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,800
Reeves County detention complex.
And pesos.

420
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,830
Texas has a combined capacity of 3,763
prisoners in it's three sub complexes.

421
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,180
Wow. So that's probably about
as big as it gets. Yeah.

422
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,510
Does that car and you still can't
get anything over 5,000. Yeah.

423
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,680
So it's in the 30s 3,300
6,500 what about the world?

424
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,060
So if you, you've changed
your name of Joel Rape and uh,

425
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,540
I started saying, Hey John Reape
what's it like wearing dresses?

426
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:15,910
Pretend you're a girl
that's dead naming you.

427
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,620
I dead name new cousin called you John
Because I choose name is Joe Hahn rat.

428
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,490
Right? Well, but, but Bruce Bruce is
the one who won the Olympic. Yeah,

429
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:27,460
but that's his dead name. Well that's
what he was going to be an asshole. John,

430
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,690
you're so insensitive. So I believe
this. I hate in this day and age,

431
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,980
I'm gonna make you subscribes to list
them in the hall. It Alondo podcast.

432
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,830
Get your shit together. Shit.
You need to get up times, Bro.

433
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,340
So way behind.
I was just kidding about Moses a moron.

434
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,040
I don't know what she's
doing. Yeah, I don't either.

435
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:47,520
It was a good name though to
throw around. Yeah. Alyssa Malanda

436
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,580
cause she has, she's active on the, on
the Twitter sphere. I believe so, yes.

437
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:55,170
She's very political. Yeah.
She's always arguing with people.

438
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:58,680
I think that was one of them. People,
you know, they, they booted Jon Woods,

439
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,920
you know, Jon Woods, the actor,
they booted him off the Twitter can.

440
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,350
What's happened? Naughty. I don't think
he did anything that big a deal. What it,

441
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,920
first of all his jobs,
refresh my memory. I'm sorry.

442
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,880
John Woods. People probably be
mad if they probably know this,

443
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,990
but New York City's Rikers island as a
population of 11,000 but I don't know if

444
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,460
that,

445
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,460
they're all prisoners are not what I
mean like there's probably workers that

446
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:31,080
live on the red hat.
Do they really?

447
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,020
It says it can get accommodated
to 15,000 prisoners.

448
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,680
15,000 prisoners.
Yeah.

449
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,020
Now we're in the neighborhood is when
a Turkey that's got 10,900 wow. Okay.

450
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:46,740
So that's about as big as it gets. That's
a lot though. If you go to a theater,

451
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,880
like if you did an arena like 15,000
peoples like Madison Square Garden,

452
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,540
that's all a lot of fucking criminals.
Yeah.

453
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,240
You got a baton. So the,
the Chelsea manning thing,

454
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:04,650
like now she's free, but then she got
locked up again for contempt of court.

455
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,530
But I think when she was locked
up in solitary confinement,

456
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:08,730
they took away her clothes.

457
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,510
They wouldn't let her have closed because
they thought she was suicidal. Really?

458
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,280
It's just an excuse. So when they, okay.

459
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:18,800
So when the quiche household was a male,

460
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,900
he's in a Bradley. I'm trying
to know. They don't do it. What?

461
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,740
So when Chelsea won the
Olympics, Yeah. Um, was,

462
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,830
that was what she chose me.
I tend to do that.

463
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,210
Let's see. In a male prison. That's a
good question. And then as a female,

464
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:42,630
does he go to a female prison? That's
a good question. Okay. I don't know.

465
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,110
Maybe that's why they put her
in solitary. Oh, right, right.

466
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,420
Protected from toots. Then that's
kind of a loophole that, uh,

467
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,290
let's say if I know I'm going to prison
and I got like a year before I get

468
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:59,880
sentenced, I might just go ahead get
that sex cig. So I'm with females.

469
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,930
Right. I Dunno. Maybe change anymore.

470
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,000
You just have to identify. Oh, okay. There
you can. Oh, good. Did you see that? Um,

471
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,760
male who identifies as a female just
broke all these world records and

472
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,040
weightlifting, the new one that
just came out. Wonderful. That's,

473
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,600
congratulations everybody.
You broke everything.

474
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I fucking so progressive and so
preposterous that we broke everything.

475
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,290
You have men that are women when women's
world records in fucking weightlifting,

476
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,530
which is the dumbest shit for men and
women to compete against this every one

477
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:37,980
thing. Even though I like the tennis
argument, it's like, well, you know,

478
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:42,670
Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs.
Yeah. But Bobby Riggs was 55.

479
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
She was 29 and they say that he threw
the match because he bet against himself.

480
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,750
Oh, right. He was a big gambler.
That was what I heard. Yeah.

481
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,150
I would say that too of I lost. Yeah. You
know, I would say a through the match.

482
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,250
Yeah. Well, yeah. Basketball is
tennis. The woman, the one, yes.

483
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,110
Says Chelsea. This is uh, the women who's
winning says not Bruce Jenner records.

484
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:09,700
Okay, let's get a look. Oh
my God. Here we go. Huh.

485
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,790
That seems like a very strong man.

486
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah. So rich, how much weight is that?
It doesn't look very, a lot of weight.

487
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,150
So listen, this is all about,
this is about reps here. Yeah.

488
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,120
It's 300 303 15 yeah.
Okay.

489
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,910
That's as ridiculous amount of weight
for a woman lift and to [inaudible].

490
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,310
You're going to be a real woman,
a biological woman. Excuse me.

491
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,290
And lift that kind of weight. You have to
be a real outlier. Yeah. It's very rare.

492
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,080
Yeah. But this is so ridiculous.
Wow. What is this? This is,

493
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:46,060
what is this guy's quote? What does
it say? One guy that comment say,

494
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,010
congratulations on your
excellent performance. Screw.

495
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:51,580
Anybody who tries to knock achievements,
the hard work speaks for itself. Hey,

496
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,560
whoever you are, fuck you. Yeah.
Fuck you. And your nonsense here.

497
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,980
The reason why they shit is happening in
the first place because people tolerate

498
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:01,840
this and that is nuts.
If you,

499
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,440
if you had a daughter that trained her
whole life to be a weightlifter and she's

500
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:07,840
really into it and this
fucking guy decides,

501
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:11,350
he identifies as a woman and then
compete as a woman in weightlifting,

502
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,820
it's just fucking stop.
Everybody just stopped.

503
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,810
You're in crazy town. This is
officially crazy out. Yeah,

504
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,090
out of our fucking mind. How it's
legal. What time was it legal.

505
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,110
It has nothing to do with
being open minded or tolerant.

506
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:30,340
It has something to do with logic.
Just basic reason. This is craziness.

507
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,820
This is you're enabling people to
do something that's preposterous.

508
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,880
This has nothing to do with being
open minded are kind to people.

509
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,010
I'm 100% for people being trans.

510
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,540
I'm 100% for people doing
whatever they want to do.

511
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,800
Just don't hurt anybody and I'm cool
with that. Saint Mary, but this is just,

512
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,450
you're in make believe town.
Why not?

513
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:49,720
Pretend you're a fox and go live in
the forest like you're, you're in.

514
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,760
Make believe this is
make believe you can't.

515
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,230
You can't just decide you're a
woman and compete with women. Right?

516
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,440
That's make belief you,
there's no advantage.

517
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,040
Make belief that's make
believe is my advantage.

518
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,700
I fucking know there's an advantage.
Yes, everyone knows this is crazy.

519
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,750
I want to see that in the
NFL. You know, you got like,

520
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,840
what does that before and after?
Is it two different looks? That's,

521
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,280
I need to see this person in a sec. I
don't want to shame this person. Look,

522
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:21,310
someone's letting her do this. Right?
You know, it's nice to problem.

523
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:22,300
That's the problem.
They should.

524
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,480
There should be a transgender league
or there should be some rules where you

525
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:29,350
have to compete with the chromosome,
your birth.

526
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,270
You don't have to fucking compete. Most
people don't compete in organized sports.

527
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,760
Most people don't know.
And if you're trans,

528
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:38,470
maybe that should be
something you can't do it.

529
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:40,940
And particularly for girls
who transitioned a boys,

530
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:45,260
you know that school in Texas that won't
let this girl is transitioning to a boy.

531
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:46,940
They won't let her compete with boys.

532
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,960
So they make her compete with girls
and she's on fucking testosterone.

533
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,130
So she's taking testosterone to be,
or he's taking testosterone,

534
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,490
whatever you want to say
it. I get so confused. Yeah.

535
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,760
To become a board Zur is taking
testosterone to become a boy. Yes.

536
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,820
And then now is forced to wrestle
with women with young girls.

537
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:11,960
In fact, all jacked. Right
Jack? Like a boy. It's like
a boy wrestling girls crazy.

538
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,260
Probably pop a boner doing that.
I don't think she has one yet.

539
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,160
You can get a little thumb. You grow
thumb. Yeah. That's what happens. Oh yeah.

540
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,450
The clearest gets a little bit bigger.
Yeah.

541
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,380
And did the ovary sort of like start
getting suspended and uh, I don't know.

542
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,070
They come to, they
dropped. What do they do?

543
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,280
I wonder the wonder that if they
remove those parts, you know,

544
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,650
because they do hysterectomy.
Some women when they have disease,

545
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:38,160
I wonder if they do that when a man, when
a man transitions from a woman. Yeah.

546
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,510
When a man transitions from a woman.
Yeah.

547
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:44,250
When you used to be a woman and
now you're going to the dude. Yeah.

548
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,740
What do they do? I just can't wait til
the day where they can do it genetically.

549
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,720
Where a woman really becomes a woman,

550
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,560
like a man becomes a woman or a
woman becomes a man. But guess what?

551
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,200
Even if they do,
here's the issue.

552
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,560
If you knew that a woman took steroids
for 30 years and developed insane tendon

553
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,560
strength and muscle strength
and then stop doing steroids,

554
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,950
it is a scientific fact that you are
going to keep a very big percentage of

555
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,650
those gains.
What are the game?

556
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,760
What is the percentage at 30%
or 40% whatever the fuck it is,

557
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,910
whatever percentage that you would
keep after you get off the steroids,

558
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,580
that is significant.

559
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,060
And even if you're not currently on
these performance enhancing drugs,

560
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,330
your body has been artificially boosted
to this superior level through these

561
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:36,670
drugs. Yeah. And you lose a lot of the
feminine. Again, you lose the breasts.

562
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,270
It does. Might not come back. Well,
I mean, I think if you take estrogen,

563
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:44,570
they'll probably call me. I don't know
how to fucking doctor. I'm a moron.

564
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,040
But what I do know is when this is, we're
in nonsense land. Yeah. Okay. It's not,

565
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,910
is it not saying that someone can't become
a woman and be a woman and I'll talk,

566
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,250
I'll call them a woman.
I'll treat them like a woman.

567
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,410
I'm cool with it and
I'm 100% cool with it.

568
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,880
I'm in is open minded is I come with this.
But this is, this is unfair for women,

569
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:04,010
which is what's so ironic about this,

570
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,200
cause everyone's supposed
to be looking out for women.

571
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,490
If you're looking out for women,

572
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,420
but you're also blindly progressive to
the point where you let and shit like

573
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,970
this fly, well then now you're
not looking out for women. Right.

574
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:17,360
Because now women are in
this weird position where
you're putting them there at

575
00:35:17,361 --> 00:35:22,160
an unfair disadvantage. Right. It's
fucking crazy. I agree. God Damn.

576
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,600
It makes me want to drink real Heineken.

577
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,020
I'm getting B on this devil's here. No,
they just sent the stuff to me. It's good.

578
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,040
Yeah. Um, I used to love Heineken light.

579
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,920
I talk about that subject a little
bit too much, but it's just,

580
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,750
it's a symptom of a sick society.

581
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,460
It's a symptom of a lack of rational
thinking to symptom that people just,

582
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,970
just being bending over backwards so hard
to be progressive and open minded that

583
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:54,270
you're just,
you're giving into these extremists,

584
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:57,270
these crazy people that are looking at
this thing completely delusional. Lee,

585
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,420
when will it snap back? I
mean, it's common to Trump.
That's why Trump's present.

586
00:36:01,421 --> 00:36:04,740
What that is, he's gonna win
again. He's going to win again.

587
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,660
Other who can meet him.
They're not going to beat it.

588
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:08,430
There's no one who can write.
He's gonna win again.

589
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,640
He's gonna win again because the shit like
this. The more shit like this happens.

590
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,940
There's then what's after chunk?
There's another four years,

591
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,240
son Donald Jr Donald J Donald Jr was a,
with a,

592
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,850
a friend of a friend of mine.
Uh, his name is crispy and he,

593
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:28,540
he's a disabled veteran or he's
very able, I should say. Yeah,

594
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,190
but he's a wounded veteran. He's, he
was missing, he had his leg amputated,

595
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,600
Burns over most of his body. Super
positive attitude. Great Guy. Anyways,

596
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,550
he doesn't get political online. He took
a picture with Donald Trump jr right.

597
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,300
And Instagram took it down for
violating their terms of service.

598
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,420
It's just a photo picture of just photo
with hesitant son photo with him at

599
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:54,660
Trump jr just standing there and they
took the picture down. What that,

600
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,560
what are you doing? Yeah,
maybe this a, did they ever,

601
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,800
when they do that that it gives you a
reason or they just do what they want?

602
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,420
Well he posted it on his,
he sent me a direct message about it too.

603
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,750
I asked,
I actually reached out to him because a,

604
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:13,710
I follow him and he follows me and I was
like, does this shit real? And he's like,

605
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:16,230
Yup. And he's super
positive about it. I mean,

606
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:19,410
this is a guy who served our country
too and he's know he's a great guy.

607
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,270
Like his, his, his, his, his uh,

608
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,690
Instagram handle is
crispy 11 B. Okay. Yeah.

609
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:32,691
And he just put it up there and they said
that they got him for terms of service

610
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,150
and they took it down and he put it
back up again. Good. Good for him.

611
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,320
So this is the photo right here.

612
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,220
Let me see when the acid Instagram says
that they didn't do it, didn't do it,

613
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,350
but who took it down that said,
however,

614
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:45,030
an Instagram spoke
first and told Fox News.

615
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:48,210
The post was reviewed but was not deleted
by the company after I found the post

616
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:49,680
did not violate their standards.

617
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,590
But that's not true because it's
missing spokesperson said it.

618
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:55,200
There are a number of reasons.
A post may no longer be available,

619
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:58,860
including the account holder deletes
either the account or the post it cut it.

620
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:01,170
And he's saying he didn't do that.
So it could have been something else.

621
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,520
Mm. I mean, you can't
prove it and I don't know.

622
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,990
Well did this dude is not an attention
whore and he wouldn't do that.

623
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,170
He wouldn't do that in lie about it.
That's ridiculous. I mean, Twitter,

624
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,740
Instagram can be lying and they,

625
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,610
and they just never really could
be a glitch too. Yeah. You know,

626
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:21,090
sometimes it's a fortuitous glitch that
looks like a massive conspiracy. Yeah.

627
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,070
But he said they'd send them notice it
said it violated the terms of services.

628
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:28,960
So if he said that he, he's okay.
Yeah. That's what was said back to,

629
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,590
I'm pretty sure that's the screenshot
you want to make sure that says you

630
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:36,640
violated something. Yeah,
that's what you want. I mean,

631
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,630
it's just so weird what's
going on now. This is, it's,

632
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,010
everything just seemed so
fucking preposterous. Yeah.

633
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,280
Just like on Facebook, Twitter,
all that stuff. If I get,

634
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:51,050
if it's something negative, I just, you
know, that's gone. I don't, I don't let,

635
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,700
I don't let people just start bashing me
on that stuff. I just, okay. Here it is.

636
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,930
Once I landed,

637
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:59,830
I opened up Instagram and got a message
that your post was taken down for

638
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:02,020
violating Instagram guidelines.

639
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,180
So did he poke post that? Yes, he
did. Oh, there you go. Wait a minute.

640
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,280
Let me see the dude. Yeah. He
posted a thing, sang it. Okay.

641
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,110
Here's what he posted.
It said,

642
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,280
wounded veteran violated
community standards by posting
with Donald Trump jr he

643
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:21,970
didn't post the actual notification, but
he probably didn't even save it. Right.

644
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,920
[inaudible] I believe him. I believe
him. I just somebody, you're right.

645
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:30,490
It is a sad, I think you also
have overzealous employees.

646
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,240
I think there's that too. Yeah, I
think there's a huge company. Yeah.

647
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:38,650
I mean anybody can go and get a minute
and just do what the what the what the,

648
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:39,484
what do they want?

649
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,090
You think they're reading Dick pics and
it's been fucking with them on the other

650
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,090
way. The other way around. Someone could
have just flagged it by a bunch of bots.

651
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:49,390
It's just made it disappear. Oh right.
To get a reaction like this. Yeah.

652
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:51,850
That's all. It could be simple
as that. Can you do that? Sure.

653
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,780
So if you just had a bought the jewelry,
I can do it right now on Instagram.

654
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:59,100
Review it manually before they delete it.
No,

655
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,220
cause I can just be taken down.

656
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:03,850
It happens on other accounts for that
doesn't get reviewed that way and it just

657
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,520
got taken down because it got flagged
to so many times. I don't know.

658
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,600
Well that's one thing that we did
learn from talking to what Jack Dorsey,

659
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:15,070
the CEO of Twitter, like it's impossible
to manage. There's too many posts.

660
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,480
They're going up right now by the
thousands. Like if you could see everyone,

661
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,610
everyone in America posting on
Twitter right now and be like, oh

662
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,230
yeah.
I mean,

663
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:34,231
imagine if you all have supernova
explosion of ones and Zeros.

664
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,600
Just fun all over the place and texts.
Just chat.

665
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,800
Who Do you think like if he
would've grabbed somebody phone,

666
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,670
the most popular person that gets
tweeted the most. Just looked at it.

667
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,780
Yeah. How fast would that go? You
know what I mean? Like just that,

668
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,560
that one account. Oh, be insane. Oh,

669
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:56,680
years probably goes to
people or do you just, yeah,

670
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,530
full still out of the people.
I follow a lot of other people.

671
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,020
I just followed whenever, whenever
things, someone's interesting,

672
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:06,820
so he's got cool pictures. A fall guy.
Yeah. Yeah. I just hit like first.

673
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,110
Yeah. Well let me see. What
else does person's nature.

674
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:12,963
They're not whack.

675
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,580
What's really funny is people get
mad at you for certain people.

676
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,970
You follow people that you
stopped following r Kelly.

677
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,440
Now don't tell them what to do. Right.
That's first of all, first of all,

678
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,810
don't tell me what to do.
Second of all, what am I doing?

679
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,240
Am I boosting up his profile?
He's fucking art Kelly. No,

680
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,650
it doesn't matter if I follow them. If
I don't, I want to know how crazy he is.

681
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,110
That's right, dude. Did you
see Tyron, Tyron Woodley, UFC,

682
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:43,460
a top welterweight former champion had
a thing on his Instagram page of him

683
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:48,170
watching our Kelly getting
interviewed and where he was. He was.

684
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,590
Who was denying that he
knows how to hog tie people

685
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,910
laughing at him. Play this,
play this here, all in this
interview. This is crazy.

686
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,600
Shit ain't funny, but hole

687
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,823
I sent me

688
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,060
paypal hall.

689
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,630
That's great. He's not using
confidence tonight. He's like,
Hahaha. To haul. How? Hey,

690
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,480
I follow r Kelly for the same reasons

691
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,630
that I love real talk. Do you
ever watch the video? Real talk?

692
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,240
We played it on the
podcast multiple times.

693
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,380
Real talk is one of the
greatest unintentional
comedies that's ever been real

694
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:46,840
talk, real talk and seen it. Oh my God.
What is it? It's a r Kelly song. Okay.

695
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,590
Where he's in an argument
with his girlfriend on the
phone while he was with his

696
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,060
girlfriend on the phone.
He's like getting his hair done and shit.

697
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,040
He's smoking stone,
he's drinking.

698
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,340
It's got like different outfits on
and he's still in the conversation and

699
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,440
there's one part where he goes,
bitch,

700
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,400
I wish you would fucking clothes.

701
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,040
Real talk bitch.

702
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:11,470
I wish you would burn my
motherfucking clothes real

703
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,350
serious about that.
Listen,

704
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:20,260
I absolutely feel for any person
that he's victimized you got,

705
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,570
but you cannot deny that.
That shit is fun. Hilarious.
That shit is fun. I'm sorry.

706
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,560
There is. Hold on. I just play that

707
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,390
triflin ass.

708
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,910
Flynn is the best,
best African American single malt.

709
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,790
Trifle Triflin Triflin and it's one
that white people cannot use. It's too,

710
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,980
I pronounced it too good.
They on that word.

711
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,910
Hang on that word as much as they own
the n word. Right. Top trifle link.

712
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:59,030
You can't be trifling. You
can't. You can't be announced
the g and track the link.

713
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,050
Yeah, you Katelyn. Yeah. That's why.
Why people were not allowed to use it.

714
00:44:02,051 --> 00:44:06,050
They would ruin it. Exactly.
He's out there trifling
stuff. They're trifling. Shit.

715
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,550
He's just a bullshit hint. Trifling
ass trifling. Here's the thing,

716
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:12,050
I bet gay guys use trifling.

717
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,550
Getting guys will pull it out out with
him over there, but this trifling ass.

718
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,050
I know. It sounds like a rifle that you
travel with. That's a trifle it. Yeah,

719
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,090
like a triathlon.
This I travel rifle.

720
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,890
The thing that abandoning those good for
long range, they'll bring a trifle with.

721
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:31,350
How many people do you think had to look
it up before Webster had to like answer

722
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:33,390
this question.
What does a trifling Heifer

723
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,320
definition laugh,

724
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,880
lacking insignificance or solid
worth such as a frivolous,

725
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,740
trifling. Be Trivial. A trifling gift.

726
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,980
See chiefly dialectical,
my God.

727
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,510
Lazy shift list in a trifling fellow.
Trifling fell.

728
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,630
That's the most English things he'd
ever side. It got very wide. Again,

729
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,090
thing fellow. He's a trifling
fellow. Don't bring you off.

730
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:07,900
So the hair without Kathleen. Hello?
Yeah, that's a word bro. That's a,

731
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,420
that's a legit word. Trifling Shit.
I was going to say something else.

732
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,330
I totally forgot.

733
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,780
What did we talk about right
before two of them are Kelly Kelly.

734
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,390
I liked that point.

735
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,620
He did an album where it was a lot of
just talking. Oh, trapped in the closet.

736
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:24,060
Yeah.
There was a whole series.

737
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,810
I think Aziz had a whole thing on that.

738
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,560
I think he did like Aziz Ansari
did a bit on it. I believe so.

739
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,510
I know he had a bit. Yeah, about r Kelly.

740
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:35,990
It might've been about
trapped in the closet trap.

741
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:40,950
The closet is great but it can't fuck
with real talk. Real talk to you. The Jam.

742
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,690
Have you seen at a shocker weird Al
Yankovic trapped at a drive through?

743
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,760
No,
it's really good.

744
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:53,270
It's the same length as
our Kelly's trapped in the
closet and it's the same and

745
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:58,290
it's all about being trapped
at a Mcdonald's drive
through because the person in

746
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:03,291
front of is taking too long and it's like
the fact that he did the whole song is

747
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,500
this one respect commitment.
I made it too.

748
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:11,850
It's the whole cart animated.
Oh my God. That's hilarious.

749
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,470
Which one is this
weird?

750
00:46:16,471 --> 00:46:19,140
Al has been around for a long time,
man.

751
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,580
I mean I remember when Michael Jackson's
beat it came out and he had eat it.

752
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,450
Eat it. Yeah, I'm I it was, I'm fat.

753
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,750
That's gotta to be, it's gotta
be late eighties early. Not yet.

754
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:36,510
It is late eight is real APP
real. How old is here? Weird.

755
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:40,660
Al's gotta be 85 years old.
59

756
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,523
12.

757
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:48,030
His first song aired in 1976.

758
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,100
He was big on Dr Demento.
That's insane.

759
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,260
So he was really young.

760
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,330
Dr Demento Demento I never listen
to it as a kid, but that's uh,

761
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,210
they played all of these weird
goofball, nerdy songs. Yeah.

762
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,830
And he was the king of it. He has a
huge following now. He's like, he'll,

763
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:11,220
he'll sell out places. Weirdo.
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Well,

764
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:15,540
he's got so much neurodegeneration.
Giant body of work. Yeah.

765
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,230
I like his hair too. He's got the
hammer. He's a super nice guy too. Yeah.

766
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,350
And smart. I've heard. Yeah, but
everyone's smart. What else can we say?

767
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,130
Yeah. He's a good dancer
too. And accepts his gender.

768
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,570
He's not trifling. That's one. That's
definitely not true. Yeah. That's a word.

769
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,860
It's like there's certain words like
that one you just seemed so ridiculous if

770
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:42,310
you try to use it. Oh, this is what I was
going to say. Yeah. We were talking about,

771
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,820
uh, uh, we weren't even
talking about this, but

772
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,440
my daughter is watching
these youtube videos of this.

773
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:57,600
There's this young gay fellow that
does makeup tutorials. Oh yeah.

774
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,110
Okay. He's enormous. He's enormous.

775
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,120
You know, he, he,

776
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:08,120
he probably gets more views than any
network show that's ever been created.

777
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,000
How old was this fellow? He's young, so
he's like 20. Oh, okay. What do you say,

778
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,780
Jamie?
If I should bring this up.

779
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,500
I just put the last thing that
popped in my head during Coachella,

780
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,860
he got accused of being in
this viral video that happened.
It said it wasn't him,

781
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:22,630
but there's did the
Ferris wheel Coachella.

782
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,670
Have you ever seen that
dude I'm talking about, no.

783
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,280
It's a big famous thing that people
take pictures in front of. Uh,

784
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,780
during a concert you could
see a silhouette of somebody
getting head in there

785
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,690
and it's two guys. Oh, it's a
very vivid video that was going,

786
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,320
went super viral on Twitter that night.
And they were saying it was him.

787
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:43,850
How dare they, he's all about
makeup, not head sons of bitches.

788
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,930
We imply your lift ticket, keep
it clean. But it's hilarious. My,

789
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,370
my sister,
my sister,

790
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,400
my daughter sits in front of the TV
cackling watching it just as it's supposed

791
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,820
to be funny. She thinks it's funny. She
thinks he's hilarious going for laughter.

792
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,000
Well, I don't know. Yeah. I mean
he's covered in crazy makeup.

793
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,770
I think what she was laughing at though,

794
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,830
in all fairness was he was making
fun of someone subscriber 6 million,

795
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:13,760
16 million,
all black.

796
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,530
I think he was making fun of people
that put on too much makeup. Okay.

797
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,890
So he was going crazy with,
she thought it was really funny.

798
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:26,080
That is fucking banana. 16 million
people and he's doing makeup tutorials.

799
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,250
He looks great. He looks great.
That's the thing. It's like we,

800
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,230
there's an all credential kinds of shit
like this that you would have never

801
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,320
expected. Yeah. And because of the access,

802
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:43,000
because on demand access, especially
like through computer, it's so easy.

803
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,930
It's so easy. Just type in the next thing,
but just what's next just pops up. Yeah.

804
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:52,450
So like these people that no
network in their right mind,

805
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,530
like NBC would never say, Hey that young
guy, let's get that guy to do a makeup,

806
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:59,950
show the blood, get the fuck out of the
office. You don't know shit about ratings.

807
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,910
Meanwhile, 8 billion
subscribers. That's crazy.

808
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,200
That'd be a fun game to play is like
what rabbit hole would youtube send you

809
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:12,700
down if you typed in this? I just let
it keep going. That's upon its own.

810
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,690
Those algorithms,
they,

811
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,690
the real problem is people think that a
lot of those algorithms are essentially

812
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:24,070
designed to get you angry.
Oh you pissed off.

813
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:28,130
So he wants the next thing take.
Yeah, our our children. What are

814
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,120
they teaching our children next? This
is the problem with illegal immigration.

815
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:35,840
I knew there's a fucking problem and
you know, and then next thing you know,

816
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:37,040
you just more and more angry.

817
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,200
That's like the argument with Facebook
too is that they're trying to figure out

818
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:43,700
what gets people to engage.

819
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,800
And so the algorithm realize what you
engage with and then that's what they show

820
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:52,590
you more of. And what gets people to
engage is shit that makes them mad. Yeah.

821
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,060
Yeah.
It keeps me wanting to,

822
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,070
I want you to fight videos on Facebook
all day. Derail and do well. Just like,

823
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:04,190
you know, like brawls in the school
yard or like, you know, just,

824
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,970
it just keeps going. I'm like, Oh man,
what's going to happen here? It's,

825
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:14,000
but yeah. Well, you know, I'm not,

826
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,460
I don't do much of the fighting,
so when I see it, it's like, oh,

827
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:19,470
this is interesting. Who's going to win
this one? And the ACA when the, you know,

828
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:23,210
with the, the underdog. Yeah.
I enjoy watching it. Yeah.
I mean, I will watch them.

829
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:27,230
I watch it to talk. It's obviously
someone's about to die. Right.

830
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,350
That like her a couple
punches to the face. Well,

831
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:34,520
the best ones are when someone deserves
it. Yes. So those are the ones you enjoy.

832
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,880
Someone's being a real dick.
Yeah. Someone's like, listen
man, you're being a dick.

833
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,960
Yeah. I just saw one.
There's a guy on a, it was a,

834
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,190
I want to say it like an old Middle
Eastern couple that are on a subway.

835
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,750
And this dude's like smacking his wife
in the face like that and there's this

836
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:54,530
other guys he's across from him and
he's recording it and he's like, no,

837
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,660
not not in front of me.
And he walked over there and say,

838
00:51:56,661 --> 00:52:01,250
he told him like eight times to stop
and then just a punching the shit out of

839
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,970
him. So it's nice to see that. You
know, that is, yeah. There's one, uh,

840
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,010
of a guy that uh,
Kinda,

841
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,450
it's like a bus and some guys running
his mouth to this old white guy who's

842
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,990
obviously a like a x Vietnam vet and he's
telling him like, just leave it alone,

843
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:17,990
then leave it alone.

844
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,130
And he comes down in there and then he
walks up to the front and he just beats

845
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:23,530
the shit out of him and,
and,

846
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,660
and you just see blood coming out
of his face and it's like, you know,

847
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,670
he started this,
he engaged that whole thing.

848
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,120
The guy was walking away and then
he goes back up to ones. Yeah,

849
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,280
those are the best ones. Yeah.
When someone deserves it. Yeah.

850
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:42,410
How many, like that's the thing about
like a guy smacking his wife in public.

851
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,573
Yeah.

852
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,630
Like how often does he smack her that
he's so confident that he'll just smack

853
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,150
her and say to everybody,
right. Like it's, it must be,

854
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,700
he must think it's acceptable and
everyone else was cool with it. Know,

855
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,350
I must think that he could just
get away with things. Yeah.

856
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,280
Sometimes people just think they can
get away with things. Yeah. It was a,

857
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:04,220
there was not many people
on that bus in this video.

858
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,610
I wasn't even paying
attention to him or that.

859
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:10,890
Most people just going to be too
scared to say anything. Yeah.

860
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,080
That's what I mean.
Death.

861
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,510
This is where it gets real scary because
that is the best argument for the end

862
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:21,080
of all privacy is that no one would
ever be able to do anything like that

863
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:26,010
because the whole world will be watching.
Yeah, exactly. Honest like you, you

864
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:29,380
might, it depends on what kind
of action you could take. Yeah.

865
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,240
If you could literally see everything
that's happening at any time,

866
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,750
everywhere in the world. Ah, yeah.

867
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:43,200
We'll not, everyone's got cam. So it's
like it's close. It's close. Yeah. Right.

868
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,960
And then they're gonna have those
fucking foldable things. Cops on us.

869
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,820
You're keeping the people on.

870
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:51,060
It's now a little bit until
too much alcohol's involved.

871
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,590
That was something to it
because if you think about La,

872
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,510
like Kennedy did a speech on secrecy.

873
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,100
It was like in 1961 or 62
about how apporach secrecy is,

874
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,920
how dangerous it is for a free society.
And uh,

875
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,600
they're basically talking about
secret societies and secret, you know,

876
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,790
packs and the government.
And he was basically,

877
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,210
I think a lot of it was him talking
about some of the shady shit that he

878
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,310
experienced and intelligence
agencies and Oh,

879
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,700
but when you have like kings or when
you have people that are in power,

880
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:26,050
like how do they wield that power?
One of the ways they will their pie.

881
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,070
It's all secrecy. If they want to execute
people and then I kill people with,

882
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:33,480
it's all secret. No one, the world is not
privy to it. Like what happened to them?

883
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:33,890
They,

884
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,870
they took him to a bunker somewhere and
they're beating the shit out of him.

885
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,750
Torturing them. Like North
Korea. Yeah, exactly.

886
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:43,020
They're just isolated from the rest of
the world and who knows what the hell

887
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:47,520
he's doing over there. So if we just
know the stuff that he allows us to know.

888
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,770
Yeah. No, that's the perfect
example of power and secrecy, right?

889
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:53,510
Yeah.

890
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:56,790
Like do they just take you and make you
disappear that he's executed a bunch of

891
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,710
people? Oh yeah. The, we don't even know.

892
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,260
I'm sure that over close to
the tip of the iceberg on that,

893
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,500
I'm sure that still goes on
here too. Oh yeah. I'm sure.

894
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,600
I'm sure people are killing people
for someone right now. You know?

895
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,470
And some of them deserve it. Yeah.
Give him an extra one for me. Right.

896
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,740
Stopping a triathlon.
It's,

897
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:20,700
it's also weird like what we'll
accept people dying from like a,

898
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:24,630
I was listening to his podcast where a,
this wolf lady,

899
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,980
she's a wolf biologist who was talking
to my friend Steve Rinella on the

900
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:32,981
mediator podcast and she was talking
about how we accept people getting killed

901
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:37,630
by mountain lions. Yeah. Like it's, it
happens tapping twice last year. Right.

902
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,880
It happens. It's not, it's not
really common, but it happens.

903
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,370
But the moment that people start
getting killed by wolves in America,

904
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,490
people are going to get
furious. Really? Yeah.

905
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:52,440
Cause when they reintroduced wolves
all the 1994 that's right. Also that,

906
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:56,160
so that's a, they're outraged
that we did that too. Yeah.

907
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,170
Well she was basically,
they were sent, it was,

908
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,300
there was two really interesting
things about the podcast,

909
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:01,620
have a lot of really interesting things,

910
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:06,390
but two that really stood out
was one that the, these people,

911
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,530
they reintroduced these animals in 1994
but there were already some wolves here

912
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,040
and the wolves would have probably
eventually made it down there.

913
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,380
Was in Yellowstone,
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

914
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,560
But that we aren't w because the fact
that they brought him in and it wasn't

915
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:26,440
just a natural, oh, we have this
thing like, oh, so many ruined this.

916
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,150
Somebody fucked this up.
Yeah.

917
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,690
And the other thing is that they
number them instead of name them.

918
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:36,040
Because if you name them,
it's like there's Delores,
Delores killed some sheep,

919
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:39,160
we're going to have to take her out
and wow, we can't kill the Doris,

920
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,140
but a number three wolf one five,
seven, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

921
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,840
That's like inmates in prison. You
just give him numbers. Exactly.

922
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:50,620
It's easier to kill him. Easier to
treat them like cattle. Right. So,

923
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:54,760
but we did the one guy killed that
mountain land. He fought back. Yeah.

924
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,980
That story turned out to be
horse shit. I sat right. Yeah.

925
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:02,981
That the male lion was one kid who was a
real kitten and had been separated from

926
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:07,270
its mom. I think his mom
got killed. It was really,

927
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:11,110
really small and really young. So it
wasn't like, I mean, he might attack,

928
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:16,540
who knows? Yeah. Well he's, yeah,

929
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,920
he's a bitch. I don't know if he's
listening right now. I'm sorry bro.

930
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,210
But I think what happened,
you were alive and were happy to live.

931
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:25,510
You better not touch wolves,
buddy.

932
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,570
I think it maybe it was starving to
death and it took a chance to try to kill

933
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:31,390
him. Yeah, that's possible too. But it
was really small. It's like 30 pounds,

934
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,070
which still a 30 pound cat.
It's fucking terrified.

935
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,860
I'd never saw pictures of the cat.
No,

936
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,910
I never saw it either because something
had ate a lot of it by the time. Well,

937
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:43,180
okay. Yeah. So did he say how he did it?

938
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:47,530
Did he put it in like a choke hold
or did he choked it? Oh, right.

939
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:50,920
Stepped on it. Something
like that. I don't man. Yeah.

940
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,650
Can I ask you if you saw this
thing going around the Internet,

941
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:56,950
about this wolf pack being tracked or the,
it's actually six of my shit.

942
00:57:56,951 --> 00:58:01,570
It's like a moving gif over time, but
oh yeah. I have seen this. It's amazing.

943
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,800
It shows how they never cross territory's.
Oh, cool. Six different packs,

944
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:08,890
I would think. Yeah. They all
established their territory.

945
00:58:08,891 --> 00:58:12,750
They mark their territory and they
respect. They'll respect it. Yeah.

946
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:16,630
It's like over Minnesota. Minnesota
has a shitload of wolves apparently.

947
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,620
If it keeps going and it's a picture of
Jimi Hendrix. Wisconsin has a shit, right?

948
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:23,670
If you pull back further.
Yeah.

949
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:27,460
Wisconsin is a shit load of
wolves apparently like thousands.

950
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

951
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,040
I could see that and it's a lot of
no woods up there and just land.

952
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:39,760
Not, not many major cities. I freak out
saw once, I think I saw a wolf ones,

953
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,850
but it was like in the
wild. Yeah, it was big.

954
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:46,350
It was a either a coyote
or was a wolf with a thing.

955
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,440
Might've been a wolf because it was a
just getting dusk and I was in Alberta and

956
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:55,600
I saw this thing run across
the road. I was like, damn,
might've been a wolf. Yeah,

957
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,280
but if you see a wolf,

958
00:58:57,281 --> 00:59:00,410
that's the spooky thing is what do
they do when they circling you? Yeah,

959
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,000
the checking you out and they're
not usually a long right.

960
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,950
Those are the lone wolf, but that's
rare. That's an asshole. He's a guy.

961
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,210
Get kicked out. You ever seen
this video? This one's great.

962
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,650
Look at the sides of this thing. Comes
out of the woods, walks across the street.

963
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:18,670
Look at this. Jesus. That's a bear.

964
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,200
That's such a big wolf.
That's a bear.

965
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,970
No, that's a wonder what that is. That
it's a big ass wolf. That's what that is.

966
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,050
That's probably 130 pound wolf
or something. Where is this?

967
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,030
If I had a guest does this Canada,
Russia. It's gotta be Russia.

968
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,390
That's a gigantic wolf rushes head.

969
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,580
Real legitimate problems with wolves were
in Siberia. They have these super pacs.

970
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,743
They would get together like,

971
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,680
cause they were starving so you get like
a hundred wolves would form a super pac

972
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,770
because they could kind of do whatever
the fuck they want and once they get that

973
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:55,460
bang and they started killing horses.
Yeah, go on a horse stables to just

974
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,300
tick down a horse. Easy. Yeah.

975
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:04,160
But it's just the idea that the super
pacs and that they realized it was too

976
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:07,130
hard to,
to just take over shit.

977
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:12,310
All these pesky people and their guns and
houses and that's, they get desperate.

978
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:16,940
Your fucking horses now.
Siberia has always been an
interesting place in Russia.

979
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:22,280
No. Have you used to do up there? 1990.
Yeah. Uh, right before communism fell.

980
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:27,090
I was there for three weeks. Well before
communism fell. Yeah, we do a bunch off.

981
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,970
Was a empower. Whoa. Yeah. Uh,

982
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:34,430
it was a spy preview of the CAG deal.
You'll get pulling in my visual style.

983
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,820
Wow. That's pretty good. What'd
you say? I said hello? Uh,

984
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,410
I don't understand please and thank you
that it's the worst.

985
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:43,780
I remember,
uh,

986
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:48,290
it was just program founded by Dwight
d Eisenhower and that four days of the,

987
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,050
it's called people to people where the,

988
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:53,540
they send the youth of America to other
countries to hang out with that youth to

989
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:55,520
promote world pace.
And that's all it is.

990
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:59,150
And certain kids from high
schools are selected and they go,

991
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:02,690
you got to Washington DC first for
three, for three days. They, they,

992
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,900
they debrief you and then you go to
another country and ours was Russia.

993
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:10,420
It was awesome. Had to add a
great time. Wow. Yeah. And uh,

994
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,940
I told Bert Kreischer that too, you know,
cause he has the whole machine story.

995
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:17,870
I said, I feel like I can't tell
my Russian story because you've,

996
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,130
you've owned it so much with your machines
going and if I do anything about this,

997
01:01:22,131 --> 01:01:24,770
then it's going to look like
I'll, I'll get you too, huh? Yeah.

998
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:29,270
You got it in Russia story to you should
tell it. Yeah. People want to hear it.

999
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,570
They'll understand it.
They don't think you're,

1000
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,710
I kind of got in trouble because I was
trading illegally on the black market

1001
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:37,040
over there. Well, we did it on purpose.
I didn't know I was doing it. Um,

1002
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,620
because you know, it's
both for the story, right.

1003
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:44,300
Because a cop and like tell me more.
That's kind of what happened.

1004
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,550
This dude I was talking to is after like
a, a function that we were at, you know,

1005
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,510
with a, we will go to the, some, some
towns, some village, and they'd come in,

1006
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,400
they'd greet you with bread and salt and
they would dance around and you would

1007
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:59,150
just eat with them and hang
out or whatever. And, um,

1008
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:02,420
so I was just talking to this kid, you
know, and they speak perfect English,

1009
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,250
you know,
we're the ones that don't speak Russian.

1010
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:07,640
So this kid is trying to teach me Russian
cuffs words and I thought he's pretty

1011
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,960
cool. It's before the Internet, you know.

1012
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:12,740
So I had a bunch of these ain't pans that
my mom gave me from the phone company

1013
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,330
where she works. She goes,
just give him make pants,

1014
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,250
they live anything with English
riding on it, anything American,

1015
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:20,470
they're going to love it. Bubble gum,
jeans, ink, pens, Solo. I was like, yeah,

1016
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:24,060
it let's, let's be pen pals. So
exchanging addresses, you know,

1017
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:25,470
like I would keep in touch with you,
why not?

1018
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,990
And I gave him a pen and
he gives me his address.

1019
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,950
And what I don't know is this dude's
already kind of in trouble with cops over

1020
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:34,350
there for trading illegally on
the black market. I had no idea.

1021
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,570
And this cop just grabbed both of us,

1022
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:41,740
the drags us into the hotel and no one
saw me from my group get grabbed by the

1023
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:45,240
way, because I was off doing my own
little thing that this dude, right, uh,

1024
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,620
learning Russian customers.

1025
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:50,460
So we'll go into his office and this
hotel and they're just cussing each other

1026
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:52,680
in Russian. And I don't know what
the hell is going on. I'm like, dude,

1027
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,880
what is this? Am I a big trouble
here? I mean, you know, he goes,

1028
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:59,230
if this bullshit not to learn about that,
this is bullshit.

1029
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,400
Then they scream some more.
Now the cop doesn't speak English.

1030
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,710
And so he's basically my translator
disguise to the cop. I'm like,

1031
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:09,660
Hey man, I'm with this group, you
know, I don't know what's going on.

1032
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:13,290
And so he kicks that kid out,
the Russian cop,

1033
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,750
and now it's just me and this Russian cop.
And I'm looking at him and,

1034
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,170
and he's looking at me and he looks at
my bag with all these ink pens and he's

1035
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:22,180
like, he goes like this. He's like, what
was, you know, let me see. You know,

1036
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,800
he'll call you want to pin. So I hand him
a pen and he looks at it. Is that good?

1037
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:30,090
Cool. He puts it in his desk and he goes
away and it comes back with this big ass

1038
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:33,680
Russian PennDOT sickle and hammer
thing with wings coming out.

1039
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:38,250
It's pretty cool looking thing. And he's
handed it to me and he goes like this.

1040
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,320
So he technically arrested me for
trading and then he traded with me.

1041
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,270
Yeah, 1990s. When that
happened, it was pretty crazy.

1042
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,730
It was fun to see all that shit though,
right before it fell.

1043
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:55,710
And did you see like lines in the street
for food or anything crazy like that?

1044
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:59,820
Yeah, I'm not crazy. Well,
yeah, we, I saw linens. Uh,

1045
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,450
we went to red scare of
square Lenin's tomb. Um,

1046
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,870
we went to some smaller
little danky villages. Uh,

1047
01:04:06,871 --> 01:04:08,280
went swimming in the Nepa to river,

1048
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:13,020
right close to where Chernobyl was like
50 miles from Chernobyl and whoa. So, um,

1049
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:13,531
but yeah,

1050
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:17,940
there was definitely tell it
was definitely some poverty
going on here and there,

1051
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,820
but not, not to the extreme
that you hear. You're not,

1052
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:25,020
I didn't see like these lines around
buildings or for toilet paper or anything

1053
01:04:25,021 --> 01:04:29,130
like that. But you know, that's what I
was, communism was on its way out too,

1054
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:33,630
so it wasn't in the worst part of it,
but it was definitely an experience.

1055
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:35,010
I was 18 when I went over there.

1056
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:39,390
There's a picture of me in red
square and w I got acid washed jeans.

1057
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:44,040
I've got a bugle boy t shirt on and I'm
wearing a fanny pack with deck shoes and

1058
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:48,000
I'm just doing like that.
So that was fun, man.

1059
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,380
Yeah, that's gotta be a
hell of a flight too. Right?

1060
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,170
How long does it take to get the ride?

1061
01:04:54,171 --> 01:04:57,270
We went to Germany first on a
layover there for like three hours,

1062
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,690
Frankfurt and then to house so young.

1063
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:04,560
I couldn't even tell you how long that
thing was. It's been a long time. 47 now.

1064
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,450
That is an interesting country to me.

1065
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,350
It's always been an interesting country
because it gets so fucking cold.

1066
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:15,360
They're hard people and they
create all these amazing fighters.

1067
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,010
There's so many great fighters
and wrestle and wrestlers that

1068
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,020
have come out of Russia.

1069
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:24,580
Former Soviet Union that can
drag off rocky five or four.

1070
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:28,810
Yeah, the new one. It was scary to new
ones. She was afraid of the new creed.

1071
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,440
Rocky's. Yeah. You know that I've
heard. I haven't seen it yet. Yeah.

1072
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,670
Dragos son is fighting.
Who is this guy?

1073
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:40,740
Creed's son till we know the
actor. The creed guy? No, no.

1074
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:45,550
Think this is the son of a
Drago. I Dunno. Some Russian cat.

1075
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:49,630
Okay. Already famous over
here. I like to think so.

1076
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:54,180
I don't think so. Yeah. There's the
guy. Look at him. There's the real cool.

1077
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,630
Yeah. He his son. My sauce.
Like a bad ass. He does.

1078
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:02,680
He's still a bad ass. I'm sure
that his jaw was perfectly square.

1079
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,050
That was like a dam square cut.

1080
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:08,300
Much bigger Rocky's right.

1081
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:14,020
How tall is a Sylvester? I
don't know. I maybe met him.

1082
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,640
Yes. Yes. Um,

1083
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:22,120
I think he's about five [inaudible] nine.
He's taller than me. I'm five. Eight.

1084
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,640
Okay. So he's either five,
nine or five. 10. Okay.

1085
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:28,300
So that hold the drug up must be huge.
Like how it tells you to say he is,

1086
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:31,510
cause everybody was jokes around and
says he's five [inaudible] 11 or a these

1087
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:35,620
five, seven, five, five. But they
do that with everybody. Yeah,

1088
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,370
they do that. Tom Cruise, his
five 10 see that makes sense.

1089
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:44,230
So He's two inches taller than
me. Five 10. Okay. Well yeah,

1090
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:48,940
I think I'm five nine. I don't know. I
haven't measured myself in a while. Hello?

1091
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,540
Hello. How tall do you think I am? I think
you're about that. About five. Nine. Yeah.

1092
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,170
In high school I always put like five,
10, five, 11 you'd get more bigger. Now.

1093
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:59,770
We're old people that are small and
as people get bigger and bigger,

1094
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:02,900
these kids today that are getting
hitting puberty when there's six yeah,

1095
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:08,100
there's hormones in the
meat. What's up? Six five,

1096
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,610
six, five. They probably accentuated
his height for that. That single,

1097
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,270
that's just his hair's five inches.
Look at that damn hair.

1098
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:19,300
It looks like he's almost like a foot
taller than them, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

1099
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,134
They probably had,

1100
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:25,540
they probably had him in heels and
barefoot or something for that shot.

1101
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:30,700
Didn't they say like, uh, at one
point there in this movie, Rocky said,

1102
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,330
go ahead and uh, go ahead. Hit me for
real one time. Just what, you know,

1103
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:36,670
so make it look real because
they were always like, you know,

1104
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:40,360
they're like an inch apart and the swings
and it almost hit him to the hospital.

1105
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,730
Like he hit him in the chest.
Right? Yeah, he talked about that.

1106
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:47,210
Almost stopped his heart. Dumb
idea. Doll from Jews. Right.

1107
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:51,760
He's a professional. He's a kickbox
kickboxing. Yeah. Really good.

1108
01:07:51,761 --> 01:07:55,020
So that's the song Lundgren put me in the
hospital during rocky four. Yeah. Yeah.

1109
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,610
Believe it. Don't let people
hit you bro. You know, he,

1110
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:03,160
he also liked to realism bell, I guess. I
wonder if they even use the clip. Right.

1111
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:03,730
Um,

1112
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:08,730
he also has like screws in his
neck from doing the expendables.

1113
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,060
I'll, yeah. Yeah. What do you got you,

1114
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,740
he's put in intensive
care for five days of that

1115
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:22,130
with nuns walking around.
Jesus Christ.

1116
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,630
Wow. Insurance Company would not pay out
until after they saw the footage of the

1117
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:30,620
incident. Once they did, they wrote
the check. I want to see that footage.

1118
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:32,150
He said he could see that punch.

1119
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,180
He hit my heart so hard that it banged
against my ribs and started to swell.

1120
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:41,710
And that usually happens in car accidents.
Oh my God.

1121
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,820
That guy can punch. He's a
beast, man. He's a giant dude.

1122
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,510
Why would he ever needs a serious striker?
Like he knows how to throw shots.

1123
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:55,460
If you watch him in his movies, he's
uh, he's obviously trained. Yeah,

1124
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,600
I want to see that footage. I want to say
that punk, ouch. It's gotta be out there.

1125
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:03,950
But if Sylvester Stallone wouldn't let
anybody see it that way because it was

1126
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:05,540
too embarrassing,
the way cried.

1127
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,553
Ooh.

1128
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,410
He's like that lady who steps
on Grapes and falls down.

1129
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,240
Oh Wow.

1130
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,210
She loses her breath.
You can never be an action hero again.

1131
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:18,490
If somebody sees you cry. That's
true. Right? If someone sees Z,

1132
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:21,670
like legitimately cry from a liver shot,
whoa.

1133
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,700
He just shit yourself and
he's looking at the camera.

1134
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:29,800
Why shitting yourself is probably the most
embarrassing thing a person do, right?

1135
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:30,390
Yeah.

1136
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:35,390
You share like a guy who's known for
being handsome and Debonair and a bad ass

1137
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
can't make it to the toilet anti black.

1138
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,920
There's no control over and shoot
yourself in your car while you're driving.

1139
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,180
You know,
white leather seats.

1140
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,340
That's the worst it's going to happen
to sell. It happens to everybody.

1141
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:52,940
It's going to be a time in your life
if you eat risky. Yeah. Right? Yeah.

1142
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,630
Think of the most handsome
person in the world.

1143
01:09:55,830 --> 01:10:00,830
Most often the woman in the
world splattering all over
herself at some point and

1144
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:05,610
her hotness hay day, most likely. Do you
remember that? Like thinking about that,

1145
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:10,120
what was the Woody Harrelson movie?
Was it w?

1146
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,900
W that was, he was throwing up it. Was it

1147
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:18,460
woody Harrelson movie where
he played the Bowler? Oh yeah.

1148
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:22,990
I'll a kingpin tink pen.
Yeah. That was a scene, right?

1149
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:26,470
There wasn't a shit seat in that. That
was, I'm thinking of dumb and dumber.

1150
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,560
There is a shit seen it. Well,
he's sitting in the urinal.
That's about it. Really?

1151
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,900
Oh yeah, that's right. That's right.

1152
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:34,060
I know how to do it because I
had a fairly brothers movie.

1153
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:39,500
Dumb and dumber as big shit scene too
with uh, Jeff Daniels. That's right.

1154
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,610
That's what I'm thinking.
It's laxative in his,

1155
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,760
where he's hanging onto the toilet lid.

1156
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:47,470
Like he's going to get shocked
to orbit and he's going, oh yeah.

1157
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,940
They got all these weird noises. Yeah.
Because Jim Carrey was tail ceilings girl.

1158
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,140
Yeah. Yeah. Always poisoned his
friend. Yeah, that's it right there.

1159
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,820
There it is full on.
But kingpin,

1160
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,420
was it a fairly brothers
movie? That's, um,

1161
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,350
that's one of my all time favorite comedy
movies came paint. That's a great guy.

1162
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:08,290
It's great. I remember loving it,
but I haven't seen it in so long.

1163
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,840
I need to get looked at it.
Looked at it against,

1164
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:14,841
scared to watch movies that I love again
and see him in like the light of 2019

1165
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:20,080
and go, yeah, this is terrible. I know
that's happened a couple of times.

1166
01:11:20,081 --> 01:11:24,420
It happens. It's weird, right? Yeah. You
remembered so fondly. Yeah. Look at that.

1167
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,590
Bilberry think that hair hair's amazing.

1168
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:34,450
It was such a good movie with
hair and makeup had to go like,

1169
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,150
I'm sure that was his decision.

1170
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,850
We're going to make your hair
just fan out randomly up.

1171
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:44,740
It's going to look like a spoiler on a
fee era before Donald Trump. Yeah, yeah.

1172
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,130
Like a little Trump thing going on there.
It's very similar.

1173
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:52,830
So as a professional bowler now and a
Pba that has a full on orange Afro right

1174
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,160
now. Really? And he's like really
good and he's from my hometown. Yeah.

1175
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:58,300
See if you're a bowl or you
got to do something like that.

1176
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:03,030
Stand out where like purple glittery
clothes or some shit. That's smart.

1177
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:03,781
That's just Brandon.

1178
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:08,160
He's peacock and he's like there is that
dude's from Hickory, North Carolina.

1179
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:12,510
So he, that's why he
wears that shit. Got Him.

1180
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:15,600
Well he's gets up to Scott too.
I mean,

1181
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:19,300
how the fuck else do you get
attention when Europe Bowler? Exactly.

1182
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,420
Like that might be the
only way to save Boeing.

1183
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,810
They might have to like go like roller
derby and just knock into each other when

1184
01:12:24,811 --> 01:12:27,840
a boat trailer board a bowling.

1185
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:32,460
I've never sat down and watched
bowling. Ari's, he's got a good friend,

1186
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:37,200
Tommy, what's his name?
He's a professional bowler.

1187
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,660
Real Nice Guy. I met him
at a couple of shows. Okay.

1188
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:43,560
But this guy's a real pro bowler and we
were talking about like the financial

1189
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:46,470
opportunities of bowling
and this is not good

1190
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:53,190
like pro pool players on
both. Surprised. It sucks.

1191
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,083
It sucks.

1192
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,520
Tommy Ari's friend.
I'm sorry.

1193
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,880
Have you boldly? Recently I bought
with my kids as five bold. Yeah.

1194
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:09,360
Dilutes maybe. I think that's it.
Yeah. Tommy glutes. I think that's it.

1195
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,960
Got, what's your high school
with was a, Yup. That's him.

1196
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:17,520
Did turn a hundred percent there's
already or you went to see him bowl? Yeah.

1197
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:21,750
He's a good guy. Real fucking
killer borrower. Do you,

1198
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:23,790
can you make it curve? No. Yeah.

1199
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,240
He even tried to enroll that motherfucker
to ride down the damn middle.

1200
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:32,300
I do it as hard as possible
or it's disturbing for
people to watch and now they

1201
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:36,690
have it. They have the miles per hour
up there so you can see how fast,

1202
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:39,780
it's like a dam, you know,
like a pitching thing.

1203
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:43,470
I'm trying to get that bitch fast.
Yeah, I just want to smash those things.

1204
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:46,560
I can't, I know he get the guys
who like curve it really good.

1205
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:51,330
Like he goes way over here and it just
whips real fast and then a gutter ball.

1206
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,080
Oh all that for fucking Beth.
The fucked up.

1207
01:13:55,081 --> 01:13:59,550
Look at all that you did shitty with
watch. Now Watch me ride down the middle.

1208
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:03,900
Strack to me bowling was
always like breaking in Pool.

1209
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,450
It's like yeah it's
cool to break the balls.

1210
01:14:06,451 --> 01:14:08,640
But the real cool thing
is to play the game.

1211
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,560
Like this is you just breaking
the balls over over again.

1212
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:16,360
It's the same look every time.
Every time. Well it's like bowling,

1213
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,210
bowling, you're just breaking the
balls. That's all you're doing.

1214
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,270
Like when you're bowling, you got
pins, you just knocking down the pins,

1215
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,480
the exact same more.
It's the same thing every time.

1216
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:29,140
And I know the combinations are different
in the way they collide and the way

1217
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:34,030
you impact is different. But it's still
the same thing. Like it's a dumb game.

1218
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:35,663
Sorry.

1219
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:40,090
And my grandfather was a big bowler Mac
and bold leagues and he had trophies in

1220
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:43,300
his house and Shit. He used to love
bowling, but I was like a little kid.

1221
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:46,330
I was analyzing Boeing cause he'd
take me bowling with them. I was like,

1222
01:14:46,331 --> 01:14:47,970
this isn't a nonsense game.
Yeah,

1223
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,810
it's games nonsense to get into it just
so you can smoke and drink and there's a

1224
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:57,130
thing that they have in the east coast
in Boston that they don't even have

1225
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:01,390
anywhere else. It's called candle
pin bowling. He ever see that shit.

1226
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:05,380
It's which smaller version do
you your ball with a softball.

1227
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:10,570
That sounds more fun to me, but it's
huge in the east coast. Hometown, Ohio.

1228
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:11,790
They've got a few places actually.

1229
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,720
The gigantic bars that they have all
these lanes for this thing? Yeah,

1230
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:17,480
for candle pin bowling. Yeah. It's
called pens or something like that. Yeah,

1231
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:21,890
I was looking down on that because I
came from my grandfather in New Jersey.

1232
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,610
I bold regular bowling, like
a fucking American. Right.

1233
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,990
And then I go over what's
this candle pit bull shit.

1234
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:32,070
What'd you guys steal this from Finland
or something. But is that nonsense pins,

1235
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,690
all of those things. See, I didn't
notice that. That is ridiculous.

1236
01:15:35,691 --> 01:15:39,370
I didn't know they were shaped that way.
Throwing rocks to thrown rocks had pins.

1237
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:41,730
That's not what I was talking about.
This is really just the bar that hard.

1238
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,060
This is not what you're talking about.
Just,

1239
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:46,570
well I mean it is but it's
it's way smaller and it's
really just like a bar game.

1240
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,141
Oh No,

1241
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:51,010
this has like five lanes or 10 lanes
and he could play but but it's the same

1242
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:54,460
game and see bowling in New England,

1243
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:58,270
they'll have like bowling alleys and you'd
go, Oh let's go bowl. And they're like,

1244
01:15:58,271 --> 01:16:00,460
Oh we're candle pin only people like what?

1245
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:04,660
Candled pin only bowling alleys.
Yeah,

1246
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,470
so we're going to light these candles.
That's what I want. Set them on fire.

1247
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,600
It only works on the east
coast for some reason.

1248
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:13,120
There's a few of those things
like how about this high lie?

1249
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:18,080
I'll fuck people can't go fault.
That ball goes fast.

1250
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,230
It's actually it's way smaller.
And I was thinking in my head,

1251
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,900
I'm like miniature bowling.

1252
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,490
You got a little ball to just
keep ball a little bit. Yeah,

1253
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:29,490
so it's Kinda like candle pin bowling,
but the candle pins,

1254
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,270
the pins are different.
The shape, like candles,

1255
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:33,280
that's why it's called candle pin bowling.
If you look at them,

1256
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:37,330
they're thin pins and they're not like
fat on the bottom. That's like what?

1257
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,290
Why are we even here?
We bolded or not make a commitment.

1258
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,520
Highlight I think is one of the most
corrupt games. Oh yeah. Someone,

1259
01:16:45,521 --> 01:16:47,800
someone tried to tell me
explain, oh, it was Joey.

1260
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:52,540
He was explaining to me how highlight
works that it's all about gambling and the

1261
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:56,710
only reason why it works is that people
are betting on the games and so because

1262
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:57,820
people are betting on the games,

1263
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:01,530
they get these guys and these guys just
fucking miss it on purpose and they knew.

1264
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,270
Yeah. It's like it's
rigged. I might be wrong.

1265
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:09,010
If you're a highlight player and
you're like, is this podcast,

1266
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:12,110
hey, I get my information from the
Church of what's happening here. We go,

1267
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,050
look at that damn glove. It's,
look how they play with that.

1268
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,920
It looks like somebody with a one long
freaking nail or they they're holding it

1269
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:20,660
right.
It's not like wrapped around their wrist.

1270
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,720
They're holding it like a tennis racket.

1271
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:28,160
How much more fun would it be if he
watched a baseball game with a picture?

1272
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:31,480
Just had that thing. Boy, that looks
so stupid. This game looks so, Doug,

1273
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,530
what's the goal? The goal
was losing, I don't know,

1274
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:41,420
throwing it off the wall and then another
guy catches it and then throw it in,

1275
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:43,670
but they somebody here to get
hit in the face pretty quick.

1276
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,000
They're putting forth minimum efforts.
Even when he falls down,

1277
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:51,950
it's like that guy, he's fallen down like
he's trying to get a foul like, oh yeah,

1278
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:56,030
he does. It looks like he flopped
Flint soccer. The soccer flops. Oh,

1279
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:59,180
he soccer flopped it.
That's why Soco never make it in America.

1280
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:04,370
The flop you can't get. Yeah, you have
30 years of flopping. You can't trick us.

1281
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,920
We can watch it on TV. We know
what you do. You know though,

1282
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,320
I think it's catching on
in the NFL and the NBA,

1283
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:12,390
they're starting to flop a little bit
more because they see what happened.

1284
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:16,610
They didn't. Somebody analyze
who's free throw to the analyze.

1285
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,560
What do you mean?
There was someone that Angela,

1286
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,740
there was an ESPN analyst who analyzed,
um,

1287
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:27,260
what's the guy's name with a big crazy
beard. Really good basketball player. Oh,

1288
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:31,540
from the clippers. Hope go to,
I don't know what I pretended.

1289
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,180
I literally don't know shit.
Go To uh,

1290
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,710
Andrew Salt Schultz is, I think
it's Kevin Durant. Is that it?

1291
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:43,140
Andrew Salt Schultz's go to Andrew souls.

1292
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,710
Schultes is a Twitter page,

1293
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,510
so he had it up on his Twitter and I
washed it and I've watched it analysis the

1294
01:18:50,511 --> 01:18:54,260
difference between him
when he's challenged and he
throws a free throw versus

1295
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,730
unchallenged when he's uncharted with
the beard. That's James Harden. Okay.

1296
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,750
We've been challenged,

1297
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:04,100
meaning someone's trying to block him
or he has a free open cup of Chai and he

1298
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:05,090
has a free open shot.

1299
01:19:05,091 --> 01:19:08,180
He just jumps up in the air and
does this three is three pointer.

1300
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:09,800
But when he's challenged,

1301
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:14,150
he throws his legs up to hit the other
person so he could fall down on his ass.

1302
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:18,230
I don't like it. It's like a leg
kick. Yes. Move. Well, he's not even,

1303
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,840
it's not even a self defense move.
He's like making,

1304
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:25,280
he's forcing contact with the person so
that he can fall down. But it looks like,

1305
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:29,360
yeah, it's interesting. So it looks
like got file. So here you'll see him.

1306
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:32,300
This watch, watch no one's
there. Watch, watch. He jumps,

1307
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,640
two jumps straight up in the air,
straight up, just straight up in the air.

1308
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,350
And this guy analyzes several
shots where he does this. Well,

1309
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:42,170
any man's then um, then they
show when he's contested, right?

1310
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:45,590
And when he's contested,
he jumps up in the air and look,

1311
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:48,740
he throws his body weight
forward and then it falls down.

1312
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,750
So in the hopes that there'll be a foul,

1313
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:54,170
they're saying like if you
look at the way his body moves,

1314
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:55,490
when someone's contesting him,

1315
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:59,930
he moves and Leeny his legs
towards them to make contact.

1316
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:03,050
Do you think that's involuntary
or voluntary? Involuntary.

1317
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:08,090
You see the problem is that pencil,
neck, Dork fucking pushing that now

1318
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,570
he's a specifically no,

1319
01:20:10,571 --> 01:20:13,860
and especially like in the last two or
three years for getting himself to the

1320
01:20:13,861 --> 01:20:17,940
free throw line. Right. At a way higher
clip than that almost anybody in history.

1321
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:19,650
So like that's what they're also saying.

1322
01:20:19,651 --> 01:20:23,310
Like you can't fault him for that because
he's using the rules of the game to

1323
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:24,950
play the game. Right. So this guy is,

1324
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:28,670
who is this guy who was examining this
van pelt and he's got the heck events,

1325
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,610
health center guy.

1326
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:34,610
So the head sports and a guy is analyzing
this and he's realizing that the legs

1327
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:38,610
are moving in a direction towards the
other player because the guys there,

1328
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:41,490
which is might exactly be what he's doing.

1329
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:45,600
It might be that or it might be that he
has a different reaction when someone's

1330
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:48,170
in front of him and he almost wants
to kick the guy away from him. Yeah.

1331
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:51,270
I don't know. Most Times fouled
on a three point attempt.

1332
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:55,440
He has 95 60 more than anybody in league.
So yeah,

1333
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:00,060
I'm going Scott van pelt and they made
it a rule to cause you may be correct.

1334
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,970
There's a big thing that happened over
the weekend and their game because you

1335
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:05,850
have to give the guy a space to land
because there are a couple of years ago

1336
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:09,660
there were a couple of defensive players
that got in trouble for hurting people.

1337
01:21:09,661 --> 01:21:12,000
They're getting their ankles turned,
ruining their career,

1338
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:14,130
which has been ruining this team's
chances to win a championship.

1339
01:21:14,131 --> 01:21:15,860
Lots of money involved.
They made a,

1340
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:20,100
it's a flagrant foul like it's very bad
to do that and the referees all of a

1341
01:21:20,101 --> 01:21:22,560
sudden didn't didn't call this on Sunday,

1342
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:24,570
like the very first time all
year they stopped calling it.

1343
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:28,260
That's why they're talking about it
really and they stopped calling it because

1344
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:29,440
people are taking advantage of it.

1345
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:32,850
W why they stopped calling it is the
big question that people were literally

1346
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,400
talking about for 48 hours.
Like why are they doing this?

1347
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:36,570
Bringing up the question of like,

1348
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:41,250
are the officials really involved in the
game and it's become a big discussion.

1349
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,010
Another reason why I won't watch it.
Do you watch sports? I watch football.

1350
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:48,460
That's it. Yup. Do you worry
about brain damage? Uh,

1351
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:51,040
well yeah cause it's
going to really the NFL.

1352
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:53,000
Do you look at a different
length right away?

1353
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:57,460
Do you look at it differently than you
did like before that concussion movie? Uh,

1354
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:59,850
well I, I played high
school football. I've,

1355
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:03,400
I've got hit so hard that I've
seen stars and that kind of stuff.

1356
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:06,670
But I think that can happen.
I don't look at it differently.

1357
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:09,430
To answer your question. No,
no. I think it, you know,

1358
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:13,030
they might change the helmets and
they've tried that over the years.

1359
01:22:13,031 --> 01:22:15,850
Do you remember like what,
it was just leather helmets.

1360
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,030
There was less concussions cause
you would not lead with your head.

1361
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:24,630
Now you have a weapon on your head and
people have used this such and so I would

1362
01:22:25,121 --> 01:22:28,030
love, you know how they do
throwback uniforms? Let's see.

1363
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:31,480
I mean let's go throw back equipment.
Let's put the leather helmet back on.

1364
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,810
Tech Tech Tech, stupid face
mask off. You really should.

1365
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,440
But you'd have to change so much. You'd
have to change so much in the way people,

1366
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:43,120
there's so many different factors. The
way that practice where they set up plays.

1367
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,760
Yeah. He would have to be a new game.
I don't think it's going to happen.

1368
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,210
I think the perception of the helmet
being safer, fuck the game up.

1369
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,520
I really think did, uh,
you know, all right.

1370
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:56,080
I used to think that a bare
knuckle boxing, I like,

1371
01:22:56,081 --> 01:22:57,730
they should have bare knuckles in the UFC,

1372
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:01,210
but then I've been watching this bare
knuckle boxing stuff and people get caught

1373
01:23:01,211 --> 01:23:05,920
up so bad. Now I'm thinking, you know
what? It's better to have knuckles.

1374
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,790
It's better. Yeah, it's better
for the fighters. The helmets,

1375
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:11,920
the leather helmets were padded.
They just weren't like a hard shell.

1376
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:16,210
And the Shell is what made it, uh,
you know, they used it as a weapon.

1377
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:19,540
So that's literally the only way you're
going to be able to stop some of this

1378
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:21,790
brain damage and you're still not
going to meet. We'll stop at all.

1379
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:23,170
There's still colliding into each other.

1380
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:26,140
They say these guys are getting brain
damage from getting hit in the chest.

1381
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,300
They're getting hit in the
chest and the head snapped back.

1382
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,340
Green's swashing around inside their
skull. Well, they're, they're changing.

1383
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,850
I think, um, maybe like a younger,

1384
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:40,360
like little league now it's like you
can't do tackle football until a certain

1385
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:44,290
age. So now that everyone's, you know,
it's all flag football til a certain age,

1386
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:49,180
I think may doubt that'll probably
happen. And Yeah. And then,

1387
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:54,070
uh, the practices will be different
where we only do pads once a week.

1388
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:58,600
Well then for the real game will be
amazing if the ever came up with something

1389
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:03,100
that definitively fixed it, like some stem
cell treatment or something like that,

1390
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:06,460
that regenerate brain tissue and bring
you back to your normal state. Right.

1391
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:08,650
If they do that, then we don't have
to worry about it anymore. Right.

1392
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,400
But until that man, oh, that's got to
be around the corner, that's close.

1393
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:17,670
I think that's a very complex question
of how to regenerate neural tissue,

1394
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,780
brain tissue,

1395
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:23,950
how to get rid of all those abscesses and
all those things that you see in those

1396
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:27,630
people's brains. And FCT, they develop
these like holes in their brain. Yeah.

1397
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:32,350
It's serious shit. You know,
it's um, wild ass sport though.

1398
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:36,670
Did you play football or no,
no, no. I wrestled in high
school. I was a little man.

1399
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:40,000
I wasn't that I've wrestled 134 pounds.
He could have been a good run,

1400
01:24:40,001 --> 01:24:43,630
a bit fucked up. Fuck Outta here.
There was another dude chill.

1401
01:24:43,631 --> 01:24:47,200
The fastest guys are small and just, you
know, I was in that facet runner. Oh.

1402
01:24:47,201 --> 01:24:50,860
So fast kicking and punching and stuff.
But I wasn't really that faster.

1403
01:24:50,861 --> 01:24:55,460
Runner didn't do a lot of running. But
um, when I was, uh, in high school,

1404
01:24:55,461 --> 01:24:59,680
when I was wrestling, they were trying
to tell me like the coach, coach Murphy,

1405
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:03,520
who was also the wrestling coach, he was
also the football coach and he's like,

1406
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:06,790
oh, come on, you're a sick fuck. You
should, you should play football. Yeah.

1407
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,290
And I was like, dude, that guy plays
football. We had this heavyweight,

1408
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:13,960
his name is Bobby Baker. He was 300
pounds. He was enormous. It was so big.

1409
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:16,780
I was like, he's not squashing
me the fuck out of here.

1410
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:20,800
The hardest I've ever been hit was
by little dead and practice. Um,

1411
01:25:21,010 --> 01:25:24,610
probably like five sat there and he just,
he was a,

1412
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,610
a db and it was a practice.

1413
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,930
I was like third string
running back and they're like,

1414
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:33,640
I was just running up the gut and I
was falling into the end zone. Right.

1415
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:34,450
It was over.

1416
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:38,830
And this k he had a running start like
20 yards headstart and it was like he

1417
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:43,380
came up from out of the ground and
went foul and knocked me back up. Whoa.

1418
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:48,280
And that's the hardest I've ever been
hit. It was by a little guy. So you know,

1419
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:53,281
think about a few moments peto
torpedo with a hard helmet on.

1420
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,490
He led with that helmet.
But you know how fast I go,

1421
01:25:57,491 --> 01:26:02,230
really good athlete can run and just
think of all that mass behind them.

1422
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,070
Adjusted Cock crash.
Yeah.

1423
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,140
Yeah.
Those,

1424
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:08,600
the way those guys get hit and the
amount of force behind them getting hit,

1425
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:11,600
it's probably unlike anything in sports
other than a car accident. Right.

1426
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,820
Other than like the white
car. Yeah. Nascar, there's,
I think they should bring,

1427
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:20,360
they should, uh, you know how hockey
league is still fighting hockey.

1428
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:24,890
Nascar fights pull out in the pitstop
let's Duke it out. Let's, yeah,

1429
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:27,500
let's say if there's a caution
and everyone else was lapping.

1430
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:29,410
You've got two guys,
have a beef pull over,

1431
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,480
get out of the car in the
middle of the infield grass.

1432
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:35,750
We have a wrestling rink and it's like
full on. Let's go get in the rink.

1433
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:40,460
We'll get it, we'll give you two minutes.
And then, uh, if you win that match baby,

1434
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:45,050
you get a little time shaving
off. You know, so it's uh,
there's advantage to, uh,

1435
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:48,440
add watched that more. I feel
we're like half wrestling. Half

1436
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,460
your leap, right? Mascot? Nascar's
a weird one, right? Because it's,

1437
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,010
it's obviously fun to watch.
It's fun to be there,

1438
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:01,700
but it's not as fun as Formula One. You
Watch Formula One, you're like, well,

1439
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:05,690
these guys are going way faster
on those wheels. Yeah. Yeah.

1440
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:10,400
I mean that's a whole nother thing.
Those wheels touch. It's over.

1441
01:27:10,401 --> 01:27:11,730
You're in the air right now,

1442
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,720
these guys and ask on a lot
of that happens and it's fine.

1443
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:19,460
You know it's true that one wheel of
wow. Yeah, and those guys die. Yeah.

1444
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:23,390
Well I guess Nascar guys did too.
Yeah. Not as much anymore, but me.

1445
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:26,690
Then anybody's driving a fucking car
going fast can die. What am I saying?

1446
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,570
But there's something, if you
ever see the video between, um,

1447
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:33,260
they showed gt three rs racing
versus Formula One racing.

1448
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:37,670
It's the same track and they
show a good gt three car look,

1449
01:27:37,671 --> 01:27:42,380
a Porsche going around this car really
fast and then they show the same exact

1450
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:46,000
path being taken by a formula one car.
And you're like, Jesus, watch this.

1451
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:51,810
Watch this. Watch this one
on the left and of them,

1452
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,190
whoa. How much faster they
are now. What's the, okay,

1453
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,970
that's the same track and save track.
Exact same turn.

1454
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:02,120
Look how much God damn faster.
They are bad.

1455
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:06,590
So why is that car going on the right?
I don't know, man. That's insane.

1456
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:09,140
It seems amazing and perfect line.
He's cutting.

1457
01:28:09,141 --> 01:28:12,200
See how the line perfect racing
line is cut into the groove.

1458
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,870
Like you see that darkness. Yup. Yup.

1459
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:18,320
That's a bunch of talented
drivers and other thank you.

1460
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:22,040
I think the fastest I've
ever been was like maybe 115.

1461
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:26,300
You ever been on a race track? I bid on a
racetrack. Yeah. Yeah. That not, you know,

1462
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:30,910
not at a pace car, you know,
but a NASCAR, but the, uh,

1463
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:34,370
but the Daytona 500 has that huge,
you know,

1464
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:39,350
the incline and just being down there and
seeing that standing there next to it,

1465
01:28:39,351 --> 01:28:41,510
like, well, I didn't know his best steep.

1466
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,670
You have to go fast and stay on that
then. Yeah. Then it's pretty wild. Yeah.

1467
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,120
And people get hit up there,

1468
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:51,700
the bump wheels up there and collide
and fucking spin out each other.

1469
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:57,300
Look at that thing. Yeah.
Yeah. That's a serious bank.

1470
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:03,330
A wall that is a little turn to the
picture, but still. What is, um,

1471
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:08,520
what do you think that degree is? Like
what angle? Uh, they've told me before,

1472
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:12,510
I forget it. It's probably like, it's
pretty serious though. 20 degrees,

1473
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:17,940
31 degrees degrees. Whoa. Wow. That's
crazy. That's insanity. That's,

1474
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:21,750
I mean, if you would be nervous,
you on a skateboard on that thing,

1475
01:29:21,751 --> 01:29:26,640
you don't have to go a certain speed just
to stay up on the probably right. Yeah.

1476
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,440
It's such an American sport, man.
Nascar's so American because it's allowed.

1477
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:35,990
It's fuck, the cars are gross. They look
to see, oh they're so gross looking.

1478
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:39,720
They don't look anything like now I'll
call how many sponsors are all right.

1479
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:44,380
You have a really nice car that's supposed
to be the model that that car is and

1480
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:48,030
that they can ask. Our car
looks gross and they, the decal,

1481
01:29:48,031 --> 01:29:50,900
they make fake headlights.
It's a sticker of the head,

1482
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:53,910
my wife and put that on there. Yeah. What
are we doing when you're lying to me?

1483
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:59,840
Yeah. It's a fascinating piece
of equipment though. Yeah.

1484
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,720
That we've decided to make these things
that just drive really fast and then

1485
01:30:03,721 --> 01:30:08,460
hurl them around the circle, this oval
over and over. So high tech, like every,

1486
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:12,790
they count every law, the drafting
of it. They know it. Every, uh,

1487
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,900
I end goal that's, you know,
all that. But back in the day,

1488
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:20,130
it was just a couple of good old boys
moonshot trying to outrun the cops. Yeah,

1489
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:21,150
that's,
that's what I want to see.

1490
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,820
That was hot rodding and it's
fine as that's what it was.

1491
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,620
That's what I want to say.
Put motion in them cars and that fun.

1492
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,370
That's where it all came from.
Yes.

1493
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,750
Guys are trying to figure out how
to get the fuck away from cops.

1494
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,990
Cops used to have those fanciest cars.

1495
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:37,740
Men you think that they had to chase
people and like caprice classics,

1496
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,630
you know that is with but bench
seats. Yeah. That is the worst car.

1497
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:47,310
Free meddling with dress shoes. God,
they make them wear a stupid shoes.

1498
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:50,030
Yeah.
Nike,

1499
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:53,970
that's back in the day or
on the page while I taught,

1500
01:30:53,971 --> 01:30:58,890
I was on the ocean. It was
Daytona 500 the first event. Uh,

1501
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,770
you know, I think so. I think, well
I'm not, no, I don't know about that.

1502
01:31:01,771 --> 01:31:04,680
But I know that's what was on the,
on the sand.

1503
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:09,960
The first Daytona was on the sand, I
believe. So these are on the sand? Yeah.

1504
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:12,030
The driving in the sand.
This is crazy.

1505
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:15,090
They're not going as fast as
those cars are such a convertible.

1506
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:19,890
It looks like the Batmobile. They are
convertibles. They're can wearables. Wow.

1507
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,970
That's what I want to see when I'll bring
back the day convertible and Nascar.

1508
01:31:23,971 --> 01:31:27,210
I want to see these dudes faces when do,
why they made him in convertibles.

1509
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:32,820
Yeah. Well they got the
roll bar. Yeah. But still,

1510
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,890
I mean I bet it gets too hot in there.

1511
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:38,160
They probably didn't have
air conditioning. Right?
Yeah. That's probably it.

1512
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:42,390
It's on fire. It's easier to get out
when you don't have a roof. Yeah. Yeah.

1513
01:31:42,391 --> 01:31:46,050
Those people probably died. Those
things all the time. Those shitty cars.

1514
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:49,440
Like if you were a car racer back
then you were going to crash.

1515
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:50,880
There's no way you're going to know.

1516
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:53,590
You're not going to keep
it together every time. Uh,

1517
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,940
what's the fastest you think
you've been in a vehicle?

1518
01:31:57,890 --> 01:32:00,810
I want to say cause we're on the, ah,
well, you know, you don't say where,

1519
01:32:00,811 --> 01:32:04,030
what country it was in. Uh, I don't know.

1520
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:08,230
It could be in Germany on the auto
mile. In the one hundreds. Yeah. Yeah.

1521
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:12,610
There's some, um, fail. No,

1522
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,860
no. That thing that would have fallen
apart. Yeah. Flying off the, the, um,

1523
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,270
the newest cars though,

1524
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,620
the problem is they're in this horsepower
war where every year they have to have

1525
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:27,820
a faster zero to 60, and now they've
gotten to the point where they're,

1526
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:32,230
they're ridiculously fast.
Like the cars of today.

1527
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,930
Like if you just bought
a regular car today,

1528
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:38,970
it'd be faster than a muscle
car was in the 1970s. Right.

1529
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,820
And you wouldn't even feel it.
Yeah. You wouldn't even know.

1530
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:42,640
Couldn't even tell you're going that fast.
Yeah.

1531
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:47,050
Like if you bought like
a Honda accord today,

1532
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:52,110
it would probably handle better and
drive faster than any supercar from 1970.

1533
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:56,920
Right? Yeah. Probably fight the
gas. Yeah. You can't feel it.

1534
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:02,020
Yeah. They're real. No way safer. Yeah.
Way more boring. Have you driven a Tesla?

1535
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,260
No.
Strive that love to those stupid,

1536
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:09,010
isn't it electric cars zero to 60,
way quicker than gas?

1537
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,560
You wouldn't even believe it. I
mean, it's gotta be right. Yeah.

1538
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:16,380
It's just instant power. Instant power.
And that one has a four wheel drive. The,

1539
01:33:16,381 --> 01:33:21,370
uh, the Tesla model s 100
d yeah. It's got four,

1540
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,540
four wheel drive.

1541
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:26,030
And so it's got an engine in the front
and an engine in the rear and it flies.

1542
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:26,260
Yeah.

1543
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:31,230
It's so it's violates physics that you
get like a whiplash and that think of

1544
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,450
rollercoaster dude. Yeah. You can't
believe how fast it's going. It's stupid.

1545
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:36,010
And they're making us stupider one.

1546
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,270
They're making a faster one that goes
zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds. Oh Lord. Yeah.

1547
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:43,150
It's a Tesla roadster. It looks
dope too. It looks like a spaceship.

1548
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:46,810
I would love to travel. Do you,
uh, are you still living in la?

1549
01:33:46,811 --> 01:33:50,200
Where are you at now? I moved back
to Hickory, North Carolina. Damn.

1550
01:33:50,201 --> 01:33:53,680
I was out here at 18 years. Just
couldn't do it anymore. No. Well,

1551
01:33:53,681 --> 01:33:56,350
it was a couple things.
You know,

1552
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:00,880
my career has always been like a roller
coaster and good years, bad years. And um,

1553
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:04,480
I actually just admits I miss
my family. I haven't, you know,

1554
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:08,560
I missed out on a lot growing up, you
know, so, and the market was really good.

1555
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:10,240
I had this condo in studio city.

1556
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:15,670
I bought it for a certain amount and
then it's, it's, it gained value.

1557
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:17,080
And I thought, well, this,
if I'm going to do this,

1558
01:34:17,081 --> 01:34:20,170
now's the time to pull the trigger.
And I think I saw you at the Improv.

1559
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:25,120
Why not say I'm Outta here, I'm bouncing.
And I, uh, my gold road so much.

1560
01:34:25,121 --> 01:34:29,260
Right. Yeah. Well that's the
thing too. And the industry's
changed. Like, you know,

1561
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:32,470
I already have a manager and an agent.

1562
01:34:32,471 --> 01:34:34,750
It's not like I need to be here for
every little audition, you know,

1563
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:37,570
I'll put myself on tape.
I got eastbound and down on a tape.

1564
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:40,730
I got Harold and Kumar on a tape while,
you know,

1565
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:44,620
and then now the second audition, yeah.
You fly up for it. But like, you know,

1566
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,380
getting your foot in the door, that
tape, I could do that now. They,

1567
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:48,640
it's just changed so much.

1568
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:51,700
That's if you want to act and you
do so much stand up on the road,

1569
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:55,000
there's really no reason to be here
unless you just want to perform exact door

1570
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:58,020
all the time. That's
right. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh,

1571
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:01,610
and I moved back to Hickory and I was
going to get myself a nice lake house in

1572
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:05,750
Lake Hickory. Yup. Still want to do
that. But then as soon as I get home,

1573
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:11,020
you know Thanksgiving Dad has a stroke
so I see that happen that you ever seen

1574
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:15,200
someone who had a stroke you there when
an app I was looking right at him and it

1575
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:17,750
was weird because my dad's a funny guy.

1576
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:23,410
Like I thought maybe because we were
going to eat Thanksgiving dinner late so

1577
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,900
like it was like a 6:00 PM thing we were
doing to get other people in the house

1578
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:31,330
and so he was complaining all day about
not eating like I'm hungry. Where are we?

1579
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:33,770
What are we going to eat? We're not
going to eat. I'm looking around at him.

1580
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:36,920
He's sitting next to the
fireplace and he just like,

1581
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:41,921
he just like nosedives but just head
first right into the hardwood floor and it

1582
01:35:41,961 --> 01:35:45,440
was like bump, you hear like
a thump. And I was like, Oh,

1583
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:49,310
dad's making a joke. We haven't
eaten yet. It's a, you know,

1584
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,500
it's making me think about it like low
blood sugar or something and I was kind

1585
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:55,880
of laughing at my brother's leg.
He hit really hard,

1586
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:58,850
his head hit that floor way
too hard for that to be a joke.

1587
01:35:58,851 --> 01:36:03,190
And then you walk over to
him and arms Kerlin up one.

1588
01:36:03,191 --> 01:36:06,170
I was going like that and
it's like this is a stroke.

1589
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:09,980
And we called nine one one they came
pretty quick but he suffered some serious

1590
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:14,270
brain damage right here.
And so he's paralyzed his left side now.

1591
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:17,330
But I was in a weird way,

1592
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:22,540
happy that I was at home
when this happened because
you know how we're still out

1593
01:36:22,881 --> 01:36:25,760
here and that should happen,
right? I'd be, I'd be hate in life,

1594
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:29,960
but the fact that I'm there and able to
help mom out, you know, going through it,

1595
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:31,130
all of this,
this whole thing,

1596
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:34,910
because she's got glaucoma and
she's got brittle bones, you know,

1597
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:37,790
she can't physically
lift him up and do stuff.

1598
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,740
And the fact that we were in
the house and able to help,

1599
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:45,170
it's crazy that it wasn't,
I didn't see the drooping of the face.

1600
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:48,950
I didn't see that happen. You know, that's
what people say when you see a stroke,

1601
01:36:48,951 --> 01:36:51,520
you see like the drooping
happens. Yeah, I like that.

1602
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:55,970
That fat chicken total recall,
you know, wait, let's see.

1603
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:58,470
We're at explodes. Get rid
of her. How to surprise.

1604
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:02,870
I thought I thought that
that was what it was,

1605
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:05,480
but now he just hit the floor.

1606
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:09,530
And so have you toured it at all since
that or if you just been small places?

1607
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:13,490
I couldn't, I didn't take on extra gigs.
I, but I didn't cancel the ones I had.

1608
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:18,290
So the ones that I could drive
to definitely as well. Let me go.

1609
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:22,160
I have a brother who's
there as well. So, um,

1610
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:24,780
but I definitely didn't take
on anything for, you know,

1611
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:29,240
since Thanksgiving than it
wasn't already there. So yeah,

1612
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:31,070
it's uh,
but he's,

1613
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:34,940
he's at a skilled nursing facility now
and they showed us the X. Right. You know,

1614
01:37:34,941 --> 01:37:39,510
the, the Mri of the brain damage of the
happening at a clotted artery he's got,

1615
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:44,590
now he's keeps getting UTI infections
because he has a catheter because it also,

1616
01:37:45,051 --> 01:37:49,100
it doesn't just fuck with your muscles.
It's the organs on that side too.

1617
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:52,040
So his bladder's got to
relearn how to operate.

1618
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,050
So he's got a catheter, you know, that,

1619
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:58,950
that that's just opens you up for
Uti infections a lot. And those,

1620
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:01,380
I don't know if you know, they're
like Uti infections when you're older,

1621
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:06,180
like it really devastates you cause you,
you hallucinate so you see shit.

1622
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:10,370
Yeah. And it's weird being in there
and you know, he would like, uh,

1623
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,710
I make sure that bears not out there.
I'm like a bear.

1624
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:18,690
Like he keeps hearing her think there's
a bear outside the window. So yeah.

1625
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:21,840
That, that was happening
back home for that. But, um,

1626
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:26,310
are there bears where you live? Not, no,
not, not the skilled nursing facility.

1627
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:29,890
I mean, there might be some points. Yeah,

1628
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:34,700
no bears I allowed to say
twink I don't tell trouble.

1629
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,740
He used to be able to just make a joke
about that was dangerous. Yes. Yeah. No,

1630
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:45,390
but uh, yeah. Hoping for the best. Still
going through Rehab, occupational therapy,

1631
01:38:45,391 --> 01:38:46,290
physical therapy.

1632
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:49,350
Did they think that he'll be able to
recover some function on his left side?

1633
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,500
I think you know,
that they always want to get,

1634
01:38:52,501 --> 01:38:57,040
dangle a little bit of light of hope at
the end of the car. Chases panicking.

1635
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:02,010
But uh, you know, some people recover
quickly, some people not at all.

1636
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:05,250
Some people three years later can
recover. You need a, here you go

1637
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:09,570
three years later. Yeah, I mean
it, you know, so we're just still,

1638
01:39:09,571 --> 01:39:10,500
we're still doing all of it.

1639
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:15,540
John Singleton just died from a
stroke and he was watched 51 51.

1640
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,890
Yeah. It could happen to
anybody. They didn't age. Luke
Perry, same thing. 51 stroke.

1641
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:24,030
That's right. Yup. Yeah. Crazy. A
lot of strokes or happened. Fuck man.

1642
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:28,510
I wonder if those folks smoke cigarettes.
Well, my dad definitely did. Yeah. Yeah.

1643
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,650
They said and cigarettes contribute
pretty heavily to strokes.

1644
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:36,010
He used to smoke a lot when he was
younger and then quit, you know,

1645
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:40,390
when he was in his late forties.
Um, but that was a lot, you know,

1646
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,580
back then we, you'd smoke at 12
years old or something. I'll pack.

1647
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:49,340
I don't know if singleton smoked, but
I do know Luke Perry did. Yeah. Yeah.

1648
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:52,890
And this woman that I talked to who was
a neurologist was telling me that that's

1649
01:39:52,891 --> 01:39:57,540
a significant factor.
It raises your chances of stroke.

1650
01:39:57,541 --> 01:40:01,740
Pretty significant. Yeah. So I'm
back in hair cream, but I came,

1651
01:40:01,741 --> 01:40:04,980
I'm going to cut my ideas to come
out here, you know, for pilot season.

1652
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:09,100
Keep doing it, right? Yeah.
Right. And then hit the
store. I was there last night.

1653
01:40:09,101 --> 01:40:12,330
It was fun. It was good
seeing you, man. You too, man.
That's doing the roast battle.

1654
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:16,350
So that's out of my comfort zone too.
Oh, it's so mean. It is. That's not me.

1655
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,880
No, I know you're a nice
guy, but I'm like, okay,

1656
01:40:21,740 --> 01:40:25,970
you got your shake hands hug at the end.
I'm glad they hug too. Well Brian Moses,

1657
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:29,040
the host of it is awesome
because he's such a nice guy.

1658
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,810
Then when he does that show,

1659
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,750
it seems like it's okay because he's
so nice and some funny too. Yeah.

1660
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:38,580
I like him hosting it and
make it seem like it's okay.

1661
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:42,480
And Jeff Ross been there sort of like
letting everybody know kind of what the

1662
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:47,250
rules are, you know, like listen, you
know, hey Jepson, interesting cat, right?

1663
01:40:47,251 --> 01:40:51,060
Like he's really created like roasting is.
Yeah.

1664
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:55,090
It's like it's come back, he's carved
out that whole niche. It's all him.

1665
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:57,190
It's all him down. Yeah. But it really is.

1666
01:40:57,191 --> 01:41:00,660
I mean there was so little roasting
going on before Jeff Ross. There was,

1667
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:04,030
the roasting was a thing of the past.
It was old friar's club type deal. Yeah.

1668
01:41:04,031 --> 01:41:06,890
It was like old Jerry Lewis Dean
and that kind of stuff. You know?

1669
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:10,330
It's kind of amazing though these days
here. The amazing, yeah, they were great.

1670
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:12,490
I like those guys are
so mean to each other.

1671
01:41:12,491 --> 01:41:16,630
But they were all friends and they were
laughing. Yeah. While it's happening.

1672
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:19,060
That's also the difference too.
It's like those rows,

1673
01:41:19,061 --> 01:41:23,080
there weren't that many of them and they
were friends like legitimately friends.

1674
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:27,100
That's the thing. Yeah, they
already were friends. Yeah.

1675
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:31,210
A lot of these roasts now it's like who
am I doing right and I'm going to come

1676
01:41:31,211 --> 01:41:33,420
out swinging. Yup. Me. Yeah,

1677
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:36,490
me and I feel like I got to
get to know you but fuck,

1678
01:41:36,491 --> 01:41:40,030
I really bust your balls otherwise
I'm just being a dick. Exactly.

1679
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:44,170
But it is just being a dick. But
it's really clever. Yeah, it is.

1680
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:49,170
I enjoy it for from far you though. Yes,
me too. But I think it's a great showcase.

1681
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:54,010
Showcase for joke writing. 100%. Yeah.
Yeah. Really good for the best ones.

1682
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:58,510
Although this the quickest, right to
the joke. Brutal. You know the guys,

1683
01:41:58,511 --> 01:42:03,511
there's a guy last night it pulled out
a laptop and was trying to do some voice

1684
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:08,851
created like you know Stephen Hawking
voice or something and I'm like,

1685
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:13,550
this is taking too long. He had a, it's
not working like just the in the neck.

1686
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:17,950
The next guy had like, it was like
four words. Pat. Pat, Pam. Yeah.

1687
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:22,190
That's a skill I wish I had. See, I'm
like, I get up there, I'm a goof ball.

1688
01:42:22,191 --> 01:42:26,050
I tell stories, I am
animated, I move around. I,

1689
01:42:26,051 --> 01:42:29,710
but I envy those guys who
can go but a bang, Bada boom.

1690
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:34,420
I wish I had that skill. You could
develop that skill, but I have,

1691
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:37,540
but you've gotten better at it over
the years. But you have a style,

1692
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:41,710
you have your own John Reape style.
Right. And people like your style.

1693
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:45,890
They would be mad like, hey man, why
are you doing that? A lot of them,

1694
01:42:45,891 --> 01:42:48,770
but I'm anxious guy. I like the
guy who tells the great stories.

1695
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:52,810
Is he doing an impression of a comedian?
Yeah.

1696
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:55,810
But do you remember like when you first
started out there was like a way you

1697
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:58,060
thought you had to be? Yeah. You know,

1698
01:42:58,061 --> 01:43:02,140
when did you do anything like cringy
that you look back on now and he'd go,

1699
01:43:02,141 --> 01:43:06,130
what was I back that I made?
I used to come out,

1700
01:43:06,131 --> 01:43:10,060
like I used to dance a lot.

1701
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:14,710
I was the Hickory dance machine,
Korean dance machine.

1702
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:18,490
I would come out dancing really a like,
okay,

1703
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:22,450
the a lot of energies there. What kind
of music? Whatever was popular, you know,

1704
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,610
something from jock jams volume to,

1705
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:31,000
you know, snap. I got
the power. Oh, I got the,

1706
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:36,430
it's getting real. So I come out
dancing. I made up the stupid little, uh,

1707
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:41,440
I do a shovel dance or rake dance, a
mob dance, and then I would stop and do,

1708
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:44,830
do comedy and then I would
get bored with myself.

1709
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:48,070
And then I danced to get in the middle.
This is what I was featuring.

1710
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:51,770
And then they have to get it. The hickory
dance machine. My favorite one though,

1711
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:53,840
this was,
I'm actually proud of this dance.

1712
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:58,490
It was any guy washing women's
laundry in the 18 hundreds dance.

1713
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:02,750
It's a very specific dance.
A guy won't look at you. Oh,

1714
01:44:02,751 --> 01:44:06,980
it's tiring it off. Well, looky here.
That's it. So he smells it. Well,

1715
01:44:06,981 --> 01:44:10,140
this before the beard, look at those
Chins. Look at that baby face. Yeah.

1716
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:14,180
How old were you back then? Oh,
this was a week ago, I think.

1717
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:19,010
Now this is like,
it's like Russia.

1718
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:24,250
That's the theater in uh, right outside
of Hickory. A place in little nowhere.

1719
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,240
I was like 700 people. Wow. Yeah.
Yeah. Out of shape right there.

1720
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:31,580
Where did you first start
doing standup and Raleigh,

1721
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:34,280
North Carolina at Charlie Goodnight's.
That's a great spot.

1722
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:35,540
It's one of the people love it.

1723
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:39,660
It's like one of the best clubs on the
east coast to say it is somebody buying

1724
01:44:39,670 --> 01:44:43,010
that place? Yeah. Well Brad,
it was Tommy Williams forever.

1725
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:44,810
Then he sold it to Brad Rader.

1726
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,900
Brad readers sold it to the
guys that own helium so that,

1727
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:53,930
you know, uh, uh, Philadelphia
in Portland, that club chain.

1728
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:57,980
So now they own it. It's just called good
nights now. We took the child off of it,

1729
01:44:57,981 --> 01:45:02,140
so it's still a great club. I don't know.
Charlie good. I was some cowboy, bland.

1730
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:05,090
I think maybe they didn't
like that. What's wrong with
child boy? Chinese. Great.

1731
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,440
But have you played there
before? Yeah, a bunch of times.

1732
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:14,660
It's hard not to do great in that club.
And it's also can kind of uh,

1733
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:16,700
you know,
ruin you in a weird way.

1734
01:45:16,701 --> 01:45:20,510
If you start out at a club where
everyone kills all the time cause you're

1735
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:24,710
thinking, okay, I've got this, well
it's been a week after, nailed it.

1736
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:26,840
Kabod world,
what do you got?

1737
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:31,310
And then you'd go to some other little
shitty one nighter. It's like, no, no,

1738
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:36,080
you can't dance here. That's interesting.
Like what do you think made it so good?

1739
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:40,100
Was it the dimensions of the room?
Was it the crowd because of the town,

1740
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:43,760
the town's cool town. Yeah.
Towns. Great. It's a college town.

1741
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:48,190
It's also the capital. Yeah. So you
get a mix of like, you know, your,

1742
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:52,760
your politicians, your college professors
or students and right outside of it,

1743
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:54,110
the rest of the world.

1744
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:58,790
So it's a mix of everything and
it's really close to campus too.

1745
01:45:58,791 --> 01:46:03,020
So I dunno, I think it's,
they are just that club.

1746
01:46:03,021 --> 01:46:04,760
It was good at what they did.
You know,

1747
01:46:04,761 --> 01:46:08,130
like you got until one
night or it's a bar. Like,

1748
01:46:08,131 --> 01:46:10,910
I remember the first time I did
a gig outside of a comedy club,

1749
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,780
it was just a bar is a pool
hall that had a comedy night.

1750
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:18,830
And I went there on a Wednesday and in
me and this other guy walk in where the

1751
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,290
comedians and they were
like, Oh yeah, so, uh,

1752
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:26,860
we're here for the show that comedians are
like, oh shit, that's tonight. Huh? Suck.

1753
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:31,490
All right. Uh, John to go get that
amplifier. So it's like there's among a,

1754
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,333
you kidding me?

1755
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:36,800
And then you have to tell people to stop
playing pool so you can tell your jokes

1756
01:46:36,801 --> 01:46:38,660
that right away people hate you.
Oh,

1757
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:43,190
you can't get people to stop playing
pool or go back to goodness. Oh Wow.

1758
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:44,870
So that was your first venture.

1759
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:49,560
First one outside of a club was like
a one nighter pool hall. Wow. Yeah.

1760
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:54,630
That's a rough first one nighter. Yeah.
Yeah. It had to. Luckily, you know,

1761
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:57,960
I only had to do like 10 minutes, but
I, that 10 minutes seemed like an hour.

1762
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:02,270
Charlie goodnight's also was a club that
had been around for so long that it's

1763
01:47:02,271 --> 01:47:06,330
such a history, cause there's so
many comics came through there.

1764
01:47:06,331 --> 01:47:09,800
Everybody came through there. Everybody,
I know, everybody came through there.

1765
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:11,910
Everybody. So like the people
that lived in that town,

1766
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:15,330
they were used to good comedy.
That's right. They got great
comedy every week. Yep.

1767
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:18,690
And uh, yeah, and in
the 80s was the hay day.

1768
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:20,880
You know what else is like
that xannies in Nashville.

1769
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:24,600
That's my favorite comedy club. Fuck.
Great spot man is my favorite one.

1770
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:29,280
So fuck that. Xannies
God places the Shit. Yep.

1771
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:33,690
I been going there for years, uh, as
a lot of deaf teacher in those walls.

1772
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,110
Probably. Yeah. There eight by tens. Yeah.

1773
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:38,670
There's eight by tens of
comics and many of them are,

1774
01:47:38,671 --> 01:47:42,180
there's a guy named Brian
Cow. Kylie. I know Brian.

1775
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:45,150
Colin does this is a different one.
Oh, I know the one you're thinking of.

1776
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:50,190
The guy from Boston. Yeah. This is a
different one. Same name. Uh, but he, uh,

1777
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:55,300
started in Nashville. It's big, big,
big guy, right. Play all the way,

1778
01:47:55,301 --> 01:47:58,670
like five, 600 pounds. And, you
know, he's a polite guys and hey,

1779
01:47:58,671 --> 01:48:01,530
I'd love to open for you and you know,
do the road and all that stuff. I said,

1780
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:03,930
sure. He just show up at these gigs
and you want to go up, I'll let you,

1781
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:07,640
I don't care. And so it got to
be a thing. You know, he did a,

1782
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:09,890
he did a Gig for me and uh,
uh,

1783
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:12,450
apprentices held my hometown and
then that night he goes, well,

1784
01:48:12,451 --> 01:48:14,940
I'm just going to drive
back to Raleigh tonight,

1785
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:18,090
which is like a three hour drive.

1786
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,580
And he died on the way there.

1787
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:25,890
Some drunk driver hit him and he flipped
his car and he didn't have a seatbelt

1788
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:28,830
on cause he didn't have the extender.
He couldn't physically put it on.

1789
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:32,220
And so I had no matter how big you are,
if you're flipping that car,

1790
01:48:32,221 --> 01:48:33,270
you're going out the window.

1791
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:38,490
And so it killed him and his headshot
hangs right there above that door.

1792
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:43,620
And so that's one of many people on
that wall. There is no longer with us.

1793
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:47,290
A lot of comedians die.
Yeah. But that, that,

1794
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,850
when do you think that
[inaudible] was started?

1795
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:55,380
I want to say in the 70s probably
there this started Chicago.

1796
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:00,540
Nice. Xannies Chicago. There's a real
Dorfman's that's the Chicago one,

1797
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:03,540
right? That looks like, yeah, that's not,

1798
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:09,630
yeah, that's a weird angry,
that's club. That one. Yeah.

1799
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:14,030
That one's not as great to me because
it's long and boxing and the fourth thing

1800
01:49:14,031 --> 01:49:17,880
you get back to the bar area, the more
chance you have to lose them back there.

1801
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:21,720
Yeah. But it's still only 150 that's in
the eye. Yeah. That's tiny shit. But,

1802
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:25,510
but it's, I swear Nashville
Nashville's perfect. You get
the flanks. It's, it's it,

1803
01:49:25,511 --> 01:49:27,990
it has a balcony right there at the top.

1804
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:32,490
Shout out to the door and everybody just
has a good time at xannies. Great Club.

1805
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:37,080
My favorite one and then a second
favorite would be, uh, Denver.

1806
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,570
I was bummed out when they
locked Denver is fantastic.

1807
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:42,870
But I was bummed out when they lost the
punchline in Atlanta. That was what,

1808
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:47,100
that was all not anyone, man. They've
lost that went to a parking issue.

1809
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:52,120
Is that what it was? Yeah. Now when it
was shaped like a barn. Perfect. Yep.

1810
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:56,800
And it had a small balcony, but they
just packed people on top of each other.

1811
01:49:57,130 --> 01:50:01,960
Yeah. So you didn't have room to be,
you know, uh, on your phone or talking.

1812
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:04,090
It was like you're right on top of people.

1813
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:07,410
You had to walk through the crowd to
get to the, to the stage. Unless you,

1814
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:11,380
I got that one weird green room the
whole time. Well, there's no bathroom.

1815
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:14,160
That one weird green room.
Yeah. And electronic spot.

1816
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:18,530
And then had that sign on the back wall
that said, quit trying to be Hicks. Yeah,

1817
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:21,790
yeah. In the, yeah, there was all sorts of
writing on the wall. It's weird, Atlanta,

1818
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:26,090
because we're all kind of hit.
I

1819
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,300
remember there was an upstairs area
too where you could look down like,

1820
01:50:31,330 --> 01:50:35,200
it was a little about
the DJ was out there.

1821
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:38,890
He had like, that's where their
office was and they had like,

1822
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:43,200
it's like the heckle that maybe like
five people could sit up there. I did a,

1823
01:50:43,201 --> 01:50:45,340
I did a good practical joke
at that place one time.

1824
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:50,420
There's this comedian named James Sibley.
Great Guy. Very funny southern dude. Uh,

1825
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:55,120
we were sharing a condo somewhere,
I think in myrtle beach. And, uh,

1826
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:56,770
as a joke,

1827
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:01,870
I thought it'd be funny when he's leaving
to put a condom wrapper in his bag

1828
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:05,970
and I go,
ha ha.

1829
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:10,000
Not telling you so fast.

1830
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:15,460
So I did that. Right. Did this happen
to you? No. Okay. No, but I can still,

1831
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:19,480
he goes away. I don't see him
for a year or two, maybe three.

1832
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:23,530
And he's divorced now. Well,
the first thing he did, this
was at Atlanta punchline.

1833
01:51:23,531 --> 01:51:26,050
He walked up to, it's like, you
motherfucker, you know what you did to me.

1834
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:29,080
You want me to get divorced? Like it
was this long thing was like, dude,

1835
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:31,900
I am so sorry. I was stupid. It
was just dumb. I already had,

1836
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:35,110
I wouldn't even planned
out. It was sitting right
there. I just do it in there.

1837
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:38,410
Huh? Maybe he'll find it when, as
he's packing to go home. I didn't,

1838
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:42,010
I didn't think you felt, you know, so
I felt really bad about it. He goes,

1839
01:51:42,011 --> 01:51:44,710
I'm going to get you back.
And uh, I'm like, okay.

1840
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:47,830
And that stupid green room they have
in that corner at the punchline,

1841
01:51:47,860 --> 01:51:49,240
right where you're sitting in there,

1842
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,810
there's no access to a bathroom
or if you just poke your head out,

1843
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:55,610
everybody can see you like who's
in there? What's going on? Right.

1844
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,730
So I'm sitting in there,
he goes, all right,

1845
01:51:57,731 --> 01:52:01,780
here's what I'm going to do when you go
onstage, because he was opening for me.

1846
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:05,590
I'm going to put mustard all over
the door, knobs in here. Okay,

1847
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,560
and you're going to be in such a hurry
to get out of there and go back to your

1848
01:52:08,561 --> 01:52:10,610
stupid march table that
you don't have to go.

1849
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:14,650
Remember that I told you there's mustard
all over this door knob and he's just

1850
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:15,970
going to grab mustard on your head.

1851
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,590
It wasn't as good as me getting to him
with a condom obviously, but he was right.

1852
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:23,170
Like I go on stage.
He told you he was going to do,

1853
01:52:23,171 --> 01:52:26,500
he told me he was going to do
it. I said, a cat's out the bag.

1854
01:52:26,501 --> 01:52:30,340
Jen's not going to happen. And of course
I grabbed it right away. I was like, okay.

1855
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,880
He's still close with them. Do you know?
Well, not, I mean as close as I can be,

1856
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:37,540
but uh, we're good. We're fine. Did
you have to talk to his wife? No.

1857
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:40,570
He's got a new life now. I'm not
going to be wonderful. It was,

1858
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,200
it was the first step. Maybe so first
10 the first name. That's right. Yeah.

1859
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:49,670
You're welcome. You're welcome. New
Lives. Glass is half full. Okay.

1860
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:54,260
Settle the fuck down. Everybody
welcome. Do White. Yeah. God's plan.

1861
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:58,280
That's right. Yeah. In a weird way. I was
like, God, come on man. A lot of ways.

1862
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:01,580
What if God was one of us? He is. It's me.

1863
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:05,840
Isn't that a song he used it is who sang
that song? It if Jane Osborne, I think.

1864
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:09,230
Yeah. You know what's really
funny? Am I right? Yeah.

1865
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,200
Charles born pretty close.
Pretty close.

1866
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,450
You're not impressed with the speed of it.
I was very quick.

1867
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:19,520
Look at Dj from the nineties jock jams.
Yeah.

1868
01:53:19,521 --> 01:53:22,040
Whatever happened to that lady.
That was a good song. Yeah.

1869
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:26,360
She had her nose pierce. He had beautiful
curly hair. She just said, listen,

1870
01:53:26,361 --> 01:53:27,230
this is not for me.

1871
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:30,380
I'd rather be in a hippie commune
somewhere doing yoga every day. Well,

1872
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,750
I wonder where she, maybe
she is doing that. Probably.

1873
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,990
What does she still out
there still hostile.

1874
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:37,500
They're still making it every
day I'm hustling to, to,

1875
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:42,290
to Allen and when I go into this,
that's on my playlist of working out.

1876
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:45,500
When I get on the treadmill every day I'm
hustling. Yeah. That one gets me going.

1877
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:49,010
Any sort. I got a dose Katt
Williams started it though.

1878
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:53,840
Like when I saw Kat Williams do his bit
about like you could have any stupid job

1879
01:53:53,841 --> 01:53:56,520
and if you hear that song you
do the best you can at it.

1880
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,200
It was a great bit and I'm like the
wasn't and that's where the first time I

1881
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:04,130
heard the song I'll go, I'll walk
that. Yeah. I'm on the treadmill.

1882
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:07,880
Katt Williams has some all time. Great
bits. Yeah. Especially the earlier stuff.

1883
01:54:07,881 --> 01:54:11,700
All that pimp chronicles
stuff is a murderer. Shit.

1884
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,640
Yes. So fun. He was coming up like
right when he was starting to blow up.

1885
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:21,580
His stuff was so good. Yeah, it was
so good. He was so way that he talks.

1886
01:54:21,581 --> 01:54:25,760
I did too. And, and it's
really fun. Fun Shit.

1887
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,410
Great comic.
Uh,

1888
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:32,470
so there's Rick Ross on my playlist and
then I also do a soundtrack from flash.

1889
01:54:32,661 --> 01:54:37,130
Gordon Queen, you know, you're the
best or, and now that's quite a kid,

1890
01:54:37,131 --> 01:54:40,970
but a valid, he sound check that was on
there too. You, you're the best around.

1891
01:54:40,971 --> 01:54:42,650
No one's ever, yeah, that'll rocky.

1892
01:54:42,651 --> 01:54:46,490
Obviously I'll go with movies that kind
of inspired me when I was a kid and get

1893
01:54:46,491 --> 01:54:50,630
that soundtrack and then I get on that
elliptical machine and now I'm doing the

1894
01:54:50,631 --> 01:54:53,420
elliptical, you know, for the
universe. Like Flash Gordon,

1895
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:55,520
he letting motherfuckers
know I'm saving the planet.

1896
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:59,300
Ever watch the old Flash
Gordon from the 1950s? No,

1897
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:03,950
that wasn't the first one I saw was
the cheat Chitty one of the 80s. Uh,

1898
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,720
I was on a plane,
not really recently.

1899
01:55:05,721 --> 01:55:07,760
It's like I guess more
like a couple of years ago.

1900
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:12,050
And they had one of those video
catalog so you can just watch stuff.

1901
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:13,610
I think it was an international flight.
Yeah.

1902
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:18,850
And it had a old TV shows and it had
flash Gordon and I watched a bunch of

1903
01:55:20,061 --> 01:55:24,200
episodes of flash court
while it was weird.

1904
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:28,190
It's weird to watch. Yeah, it's weird
to watch what people thought like space.

1905
01:55:28,191 --> 01:55:30,850
Who's going to be like and
aliens. It's so strange. Yeah.

1906
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:34,250
I mean I think Flash Gordon was
probably from the fifties right?

1907
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:37,400
It was a comic book, wasn't it? Yes.
Yeah, so originally a comic book.

1908
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,620
See if he could get pull up video
of they need to remake that film.

1909
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:43,980
Photos of the green room and the
punchline. I was looking for that

1910
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,110
Hick slide.
Oh we've showed that before.

1911
01:55:47,230 --> 01:55:50,700
I wish they would remake Flash Gordon
and make it a comedy but keep the

1912
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:55,230
soundtrack cause it's queen. Oh human
rights. These huge queens. Huge right now.

1913
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:57,180
Keep the exact same soundtrack.

1914
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:00,820
Make Flash Gordon a comedy
Jack Black get does.

1915
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:05,160
Well you thinking of a Flash Gordon, the
movie the movie. I'm sorry. Move Way, way,

1916
01:56:05,161 --> 01:56:07,820
way. There's the original
flush board with Maine.

1917
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:12,210
The merciless collide to some ball.
Let's look at him.

1918
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:16,200
How Wa, how weird does he look? We got
flash like that's what they thought.

1919
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:19,650
People are going to be wearing weird
neck powers in the future belt buckles.

1920
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:22,290
It's such a strange look man.

1921
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:25,760
It just a lightning bolt on your
chest pull up was a good deal of it.

1922
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:27,360
So we could watch a video because it's so,

1923
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:30,240
it's so weird to watch
cause it looks like,

1924
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:34,650
what years did it say 56 c
four to 55 Ming the merciless.

1925
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:39,240
So this is where he like,
it's so shitty.

1926
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:42,940
Like the special effects were. So this
is not even the movie. This is the,

1927
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:47,670
I know but I mean I'm
saying the claim jumpers,

1928
01:56:47,671 --> 01:56:52,110
Steve Holland does Flash Gordon,
Irene Champlin, Dale Arden,

1929
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:57,570
look she's hot. She's hot in a real way.
Yeah. There was no faking it back then.

1930
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:01,860
Doctors are calling. Yeah, same
care. I have not seen this though.

1931
01:57:01,861 --> 01:57:06,120
So this was a whole TV show.
How many episodes do you think they made?

1932
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:10,080
If I had to guess, I bet they made 50
or something like that. Look at that.

1933
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:12,690
She's got a shirt.
She is hot.

1934
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:18,330
It was like a drill.
She's holding a drill.

1935
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:22,200
Women back then all had flat butts
unless they did gymnastics. Right.

1936
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:27,201
Unless you're some freak
of nature accident and then
that is some sort of weird

1937
01:57:28,351 --> 01:57:33,150
deal. Does stupid. That's
a jackhammer that you know
what the handheld Jackhammer.

1938
01:57:33,151 --> 01:57:37,080
It looks like that Tim Tam.
That there gun. That's what
it looks like right there.

1939
01:57:38,730 --> 01:57:42,840
What does this thing, this is a
thing as I do, it's for massage.

1940
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,180
Oh shit hurts.

1941
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:50,580
May I? Yes. Hang on.

1942
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:54,450
Probably shouldn't do it right in front
of them on a microphone. It's great.

1943
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:58,470
It doesn't hurt to feel good for
loosening up the muscles. No Bro.

1944
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:02,340
That's what they had. Good
Lord. Yeah. That's their weapon.

1945
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:05,010
But to me I'm gonna Punch
you in the face real fast.

1946
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:08,670
It's always weird seeing what people
thought the future was going to be like

1947
01:58:08,671 --> 01:58:12,150
once the futurity hits. Yeah. Cause
if you think of that movie alien,

1948
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:16,110
like didn't we figure that out?
It was like 2015 or something like that.

1949
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,110
They thought the first one was
in 2000 with a soul. Yeah. Yeah.

1950
01:58:20,111 --> 01:58:24,090
Like yeah,
it was 2015 yeah.

1951
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:28,440
It was something along like, well
back to the futures classic, you know,

1952
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:32,100
their future was a, what was
it, two, what was the future?

1953
01:58:32,101 --> 01:58:35,580
Cause it happened in
1985 and they went to,

1954
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:37,170
and the second when
they went to the future,

1955
01:58:37,171 --> 01:58:41,860
but it was like 2015 or
something, right? Yeah.

1956
01:58:41,861 --> 01:58:42,190
Something

1957
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:42,430
like that.

1958
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:46,630
What befell is the billionaire now because
he took that stupid a sports almanac

1959
01:58:46,631 --> 01:58:47,680
and bet on a bunch of shit.

1960
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:50,590
I watched that a couple of years
ago at a movie theater in Bozeman,

1961
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:51,970
Montana with my family.

1962
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,190
They had like a back to the future
night where they were playing it,

1963
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:56,820
you know the appointment, the old
classic movie. It's fucking great.

1964
01:58:56,850 --> 01:58:58,750
That won't show up.
It's so good.

1965
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:02,020
It's especially cool to see an
old movie in a movie theater.

1966
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:03,170
I got know they do those.

1967
01:59:03,171 --> 01:59:06,130
Sometimes it's certain movie theaters
will have like they'll screen and old

1968
01:59:06,131 --> 01:59:07,660
moving. Yeah, it's fucking,

1969
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:12,661
I went to the Hollywood bowl and watched
back to the future with and it had an

1970
01:59:12,671 --> 01:59:16,300
orchestra playing live.
Ah, the soundtrack.

1971
01:59:16,301 --> 01:59:21,080
You know the movie as it's happening
and you kind of forget that that's,

1972
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:23,710
that shit's happening right now.
Yeah, we do that every year.

1973
01:59:23,711 --> 01:59:27,610
We go to see the nightmare
before Christmas. Oh yeah,
they do that. Yeah. Yeah.

1974
01:59:27,611 --> 01:59:31,090
It's great. You ever go to the cemetery
and watch a movie? No. Forever.

1975
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,800
I did a show there once though. He did?
Yeah. Duncan Trussell used to host a show.

1976
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:39,040
I love him. So what outside? No,

1977
01:59:39,041 --> 01:59:42,160
inside there's like an inside place
where you just stand up. Okay.

1978
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:45,560
It was really weird. Yeah, we did
stand out. Did that one at the center,

1979
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,750
these concerts there and shit. Yeah. Yeah.

1980
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:50,860
Well that's what they have that one
gigantic white wall and they just project

1981
01:59:50,861 --> 01:59:54,400
movies and everyone sits on the lawn.
It's like 5,000 people. Where does that,

1982
01:59:54,430 --> 01:59:57,370
I'll watch purple rain cemetery.
Look at that. I want to scream.

1983
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:02,290
This is super weird. Scream
the are movie cemetery.

1984
02:00:02,291 --> 02:00:05,840
That would be good. That's actually a
great move. But they, yeah. Cinespia they,

1985
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:10,120
you know, I was there watching a purple
rain and Dave Chappelle was there.

1986
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:12,220
Um, they come out, there's a Dj,

1987
02:00:12,221 --> 02:00:15,220
they do stuff before and after the movie
and what addresses up like characters

1988
02:00:15,221 --> 02:00:17,830
from the film. Wow. Yeah. That's awesome.

1989
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:23,430
Have you seen proper writing the movie
lately? No. That's great. Is it? No.

1990
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:26,350
Yes and no. Yes and no. Acting is so bad.

1991
02:00:27,550 --> 02:00:31,820
I made great sarcastically
prints. It's that.

1992
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,450
It's so funny when he,

1993
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:37,910
there's this one when he first makes
his full face on film. Right. And this,

1994
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:40,800
the movie, it takes a minute.
There's this one scene where it was,

1995
02:00:40,801 --> 02:00:43,870
the Apollonia is walking off and he's
mad and he just like whips around real

1996
02:00:43,871 --> 02:00:47,500
fast and his hair comes and does that.
And then everybody in that,

1997
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:50,410
in the cemetery was watching this
in front of like 5,000 people.

1998
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:54,600
Every girl is like
looking

1999
02:00:56,150 --> 02:01:00,600
at it. Hello. This guy
was four foot one. Oh Man.

2000
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:05,520
But it was 80 pounds kind of changed
music. Yeah, I know. I was a huge fan.

2001
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:07,600
Yeah.
I saw this one in a theory.

2002
02:01:07,630 --> 02:01:11,340
Came out was the first time that like
our French kissed a girl and touched a

2003
02:01:11,341 --> 02:01:15,580
booby was done this movie. Well. It's
also like, oh, and there's a lot of why,

2004
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:20,250
and mine started this movie.
There was a lot. Yeah, it didn't.

2005
02:01:20,251 --> 02:01:23,820
He hits her in the mirror. Yeah. And
he's like, oh, I want to be like my dad.

2006
02:01:23,821 --> 02:01:28,790
But he actually hits her and he says,
he said the f word as well. Yeah.

2007
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:33,870
Not Wow. Yeah, that's right.
I'm afraid to say anything. I

2008
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:38,570
don't do it. Now you
know about deadname. Oh,

2009
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:42,620
always free dead naming.
No names.

2010
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:45,740
You can get kicked off of Twitter
for life, bitch for light.

2011
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:48,950
I'm barely even on Twitter. Really?
How to, yeah. Well I'm, I'm on there,

2012
02:01:48,951 --> 02:01:52,670
but I'm going to, Facebook seems
to be where my people are. Really.

2013
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:55,970
What people are those
rednecks from Hickory?

2014
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:58,710
Is that more of a while?

2015
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:02,790
I had nothing wrong with my space and I
was okay with my spoon. You're on mine.

2016
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:05,570
Hey, good luck to all
man. You've got mail.

2017
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:11,300
I think I was like this huge. Got An
oil. That's perfect. That's perfect.

2018
02:02:12,010 --> 02:02:14,990
Yes.
There was one before my space too.

2019
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:19,400
There was the Olympic
Friendster. Friendster, yeah.

2020
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:21,920
A couple of other ones,
but it was my space.

2021
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:26,330
Then face what we think's going
to be the next thing. Tick talk.

2022
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:30,520
Is that a new machine that, oh,
that's like music videos. Yeah.

2023
02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:32,900
That's not going to work with little kids.

2024
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:35,300
I didn't really get annoyed
with the commercials for it.

2025
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:38,330
Eventually people give
up. Yeah. What will,

2026
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:39,920
the next thing will be
something in your brain.

2027
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:42,300
It would be a chip that's going to happen.
Yeah.

2028
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:45,560
The iCloud where everyone's just
hanging out with each other. Yeah.

2029
02:02:45,561 --> 02:02:48,260
Some virtual world when
you're in an Avatar, right,

2030
02:02:48,261 --> 02:02:52,250
and you get to be a perfect person out
there. Yup. Yeah. That's going to happen.

2031
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:55,880
I'll try it out with the world
we live in is very strange.

2032
02:02:55,881 --> 02:02:59,120
