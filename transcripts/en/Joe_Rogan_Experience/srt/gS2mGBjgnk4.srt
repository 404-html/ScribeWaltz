1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,860
Experience.
I'm always trying to type faster than

2
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:20,490
that commercial and I always fail.
So I'm trying to tweet this live in the

3
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,380
moment and then stare at it.
My,

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,560
with my ever shittier eyes.
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,600
Tell me what am I supposed to tweet it?
I'm doing this right now.

6
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,740
I just tweeted it.
You could retweet it and that way it'll

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,370
be,
but I've tweeted,

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,870
my eyes are fine until I w I stare at my
fucking computer too much.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,301
No,
they,

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,930
they get screwed up and then you try to
look at the TV and you can't see what's

11
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,180
going on.
It's guaranteed it's age,

12
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,420
but it's also,
I don't think screens are good for you.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,410
Have you ever like taken a picture with
your cell phone of a screen and then you

14
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:52,200
see those lines that you can't say like
whatever the fuck those are.

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,480
Well let's actually just your phones,
the aperture on the camera's not able to

16
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:01,090
catch up with the flickering images
arise.

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,000
So then if I'm looking through this
screen at that,

18
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,330
that doesn't fuck with my eyes and think
it's the actual strain of staring at

19
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:10,050
something that's lit up so close to your
face that's really fucking with you more

20
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,430
than anything.
Isn't that correct?

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,280
Is that the correct aperture?
Is that the correct terminology?

22
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,190
And you're squinting or you're reading,
you're,

23
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:17,970
you're squinting your eyes.
You don't even realize it,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,460
but that's not what we're talking about.
We're talking about the flashing thing.

25
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:24,150
The flashing thing like this,
just your camera can't catch shutter

26
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,370
speeds that what it is.
Um,

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,840
like if you watch a cars,
if you see videos of cars that have LCD

28
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,150
lenses,
there's something happens when you film

29
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:34,740
them,
it looks like they're flashing.

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,380
It's a different refresh rate usually.
Yeah.

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,750
It's weird.
I don't like any of that shit,

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,170
which is why my new special,
I actually did it in black and white

33
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,120
because I don't like HD TV.

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,180
I think it's,
I don't like seeing somebody pours is

35
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,040
they're talking to me like HD at this
point.

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,250
It was great.
And then it got to a point where it was

37
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:54,480
too,
it was too real.

38
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,300
It's clearer than real life.
Like I went to a game at a Dallas

39
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:01,950
Cowboys Football Stadium and they've got
this giant fucking TV classic Texas,

40
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,960
right?
We've got the biggest fucking TV,

41
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:07,560
you know,
that means we're the best and it was so

42
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,320
clear.
It looks realer than what was going on

43
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,640
in the field.
And you,

44
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,530
I had to like pull my at the visor down
on my,

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,410
my,
my head cause I kept wanting to look at

46
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:17,660
that.
Tony,

47
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:20,250
we're almost like right in front of me.
The promoter hook me up with these great

48
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:22,690
seats.
He's fucking right there and I'm looking

49
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,970
up further away than he is for me
looking up at this giant fucking TV.

50
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,160
It's also an instinct to look at
screens.

51
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,100
I see that a lot of the UFC people are,
their babies do it.

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,920
Everybody does.
It's an instinct to stare because it's

53
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,520
so captivating and we're used to staring
at screens.

54
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,760
So like if you're at a sporting event
and there's a screen there,

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,130
you just autumn automatically start
gravitating towards that screen for

56
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,650
some,
I look at the screens here,

57
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:49,620
I usually always just look right here
instead of looking right there.

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,260
Well you should,
you're actually running shit as supposed

59
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,860
to do that and make sure that nothing's,
I don't know,

60
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,640
demons behind us and we don't know
about,

61
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,890
yeah,
I'm not a fan of a technology

62
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,470
electronics.
I liked some of it.

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,510
It just,
I feel like all the benefits of it are

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,140
taken away.
And then some with the crashing,

65
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,480
with the refreshing,
with the,

66
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,460
what the fuck just happened with the,
Oh,

67
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,880
now this is outdated and I have to buy a
new one and then I throw this one into

68
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,070
the fucking ocean.
I go back and forth.

69
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,740
I love it in a lot of ways because,
um,

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,940
I'm just fascinated by innovation.
I'm fascinated by these new things that

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,270
these new people keep inventing,
but there's also part of me that

72
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:31,210
realizes that a certain point,
Tom's not benefiting us anymore.

73
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,370
It's not like making our lives easier,
it's just making things more connected

74
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:40,270
to electronics.
It's making you more into like whatever

75
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,450
world to the electronics create.
Yeah.

76
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,630
Somewhere in the 90s we pretty much
could have slat towed here we will fine

77
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,240
and even people say,
well what about medical stuff and like

78
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,730
helping people out and everything,
helping them live long and cure disease

79
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,120
and everything.

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,080
That basically kills the rest of us to
keep that other person alive and then

81
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,750
they're still alive,
taken a shit that ends up in a river and

82
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,700
it just keeps polluting more and more.
We're just,

83
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,500
we're like,
we've just for all over the fucking

84
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,050
place and it really needs to shrink
down.

85
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,870
Like the technology I don't think would
be a problem if they weren't.

86
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:12,430
So everybody has a fucking lapped are so
many people have laptops and shirts and

87
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,340
all this shit that we just keep buying
and then throw it out.

88
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,380
Like you know that Paul put litter in
its place.

89
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,970
You ever think about that?
It's like when they pick it up,

90
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,040
where do you think it goes?
Do you think it leaves earth?

91
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,770
It just goes somewhere else.
We don't have to look at it and it's

92
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,420
just fucking sitting there.
What's going to happen is they're going

93
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:31,330
to figure out a way to take everything
that we make and turn it into either a

94
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:34,300
product or turn it into fuel.

95
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,820
Like whenever we make something and we
have to throw it out,

96
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,070
it'll just become fuel for something
else.

97
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,240
Do you know how many people would have
to agree just to even get that ball even

98
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,650
slightly moving?
They will just,

99
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,260
somehow Jesus would be brought up and
somehow,

100
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,350
uh,
just something them versus us,

101
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,550
Republican,
Democrat,

102
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,620
liberal,
conservative and nothing would get done

103
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,410
and they would just sit there screaming
at each other maybe.

104
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,330
Or maybe they could figure out a way to
actually use whatever the fuck pollution

105
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,400
is,
like whatever the carbon goes into the

106
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,790
atmosphere,
pull that out and convert that into

107
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,580
energy.
It seems like there's probably some

108
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:12,910
fucking nerds that already know how to
do something along those lines.

109
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,340
Maybe not to that level,
but at least take the shit from down the

110
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:16,091
dump.
You know,

111
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,990
they know how to do it.
There's just no money in it and it's

112
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:23,150
just like they probably get checks to
not get things done.

113
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,040
Please show up with hookers and fucking
just a fucking big freight train full of

114
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,390
money.
Kalon boys.

115
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:32,560
It's a party so that then we got to get
all new machines that's going to cost us

116
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:36,370
a bunch of money.
Just do it the way we do it until we die

117
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,590
and then you guys can do it how you want
to do it.

118
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:40,150
By then someone else has bought into the
deal.

119
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,370
So I am completely pessimistic when it
comes to that shit.

120
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,880
People think that that's all bullshit
that like those kinds of conspiracies

121
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,320
don't exist.
Come on,

122
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:49,320
you guys are just nuts.
This is stupid.

123
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,190
Nobody would do that.
If they get rid of pollution,

124
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,920
they would.
But if getting rid of the pollution

125
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:57,590
costs somebody money,
I guarantee you there'd be somebody that

126
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,130
tried to cock

127
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,030
pocket.
Yeah,

128
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,380
there would be.
If there was a guy like the,

129
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,590
the classic William Randolph Hearst
story,

130
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,960
I don't know this,
but the reason why marijuana became

131
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,780
illegal wasn't because there was a
problem with people smoking marijuana.

132
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,950
It was because William Randolph Hearst
owned paper mills and he also own

133
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:18,560
newspapers and so he was going to have
to convert his paper mills over the hemp

134
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:23,561
paper because it's way easier to grow.
You refill an entire forest in like a

135
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,060
year,
like you chop them down.

136
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,240
They brought her,
oh yeah.

137
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:30,560
I mean he owned a lot of newspapers and
he was the reason why Rosebud was,

138
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,340
you know,
that whole,

139
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,890
that whole citizen Kane movie,
the coast,

140
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,690
he's fucking,
he was fucking crazy.

141
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,860
But he had so much money and so much
power that he could just print fake

142
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:43,340
stories.
So he wrote these stories about blacks

143
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,470
and Mexicans and I'm sure he didn't
write them,

144
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,010
but he commissioned them blacks and
Michigan smoking this new drug called

145
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,020
marijuana and having sex with all these
white women.

146
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,960
Like that wasn't even what they called
marijuana.

147
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,900
If he actually did that.
I want to have people died because of

148
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,220
that story.
Oh God.

149
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,490
A lot.
I'm sure a lot people in jail.

150
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,630
I mean,
just think about that.

151
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,330
That was in the 1930s and it's still
stuck.

152
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,300
It was all about hemp.
It wasn't even about marijuana.

153
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,860
They weren't even worried about the
drug.

154
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,700
The drug was commonly used amongst jazz
singers and all these other people.

155
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,830
It's smoked pot.
It was a normal thing.

156
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,530
The real issue was the hemp,
like the commodity,

157
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:22,370
the non psychoactive hemp.
They were worried about it taking over

158
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,570
and having to spend millions of dollars
to convert all his paper plants to hemp

159
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,310
paper.

160
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,480
Yeah.
You just want to smoke weed

161
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,120
against the good spirits.
People who don't believe in conspiracy

162
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,170
is fighting to be.
It's like,

163
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:39,370
dude,
you can inspire.

164
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,430
You go to a bar,
you see two hot chicks.

165
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:43,900
She come up with a game plan.
That's a conspiracy.

166
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:45,840
You conspiring to get over there and try
and fuck them.

167
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,260
Then just to sit there and like,
like all advertising there.

168
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,510
You're a cunt.
What the fuck I'm doing here now?

169
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,030
Selling my special.
You don't conspire.

170
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,770
Yeah.
You think I just showed up here?

171
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,400
Yeah.
We conspired talks.

172
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,850
Your children's got a Zillion fucking
followers.

173
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,830
He's a fan of my shit.
I know it's gonna come off.

174
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,330
Good.
This'll get me more like,

175
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,961
yeah,
I want,

176
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:08,800
I want this to keep going.
Just not randomly doing this shit.

177
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,000
You're conspiring.
Yeah.

178
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:13,030
But just because I'm not whacking a
president in the middle of it doesn't

179
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,620
mean it's not a conspiracy.
Well,

180
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,510
the shed like the end

181
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,870
Ron's disaster that went down,
that was a conspiracy.

182
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,290
There's a bunch of conspiracies that you
could see in clear form

183
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,540
that actually did happen.
Well,

184
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,640
the best thing they did is they make
conspiracy synonymous with more ronic

185
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,610
thought.
And everybody says,

186
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:29,720
Oh,
you putting your 10 ad on.

187
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,970
It's like this whole country came about
through a conspiracy.

188
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,820
The Revolution was not a spontaneous
act.

189
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,590
People sat there and was like,
okay,

190
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:37,880
we're going to rebel against these
fuckers.

191
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,640
Well,
they're gonna hang us as traders if we

192
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,980
don't pull this off.
They came up with a game plan,

193
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,900
if you want to call it that.
But if,

194
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,910
if they lost,
they would,

195
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,990
they would have been talking about this
treasonous conspiracy by all these guys

196
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:55,190
that are now on our money site.
Right up.

197
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:57,150
So true.
That's so true.

198
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,870
Yeah.
But now,

199
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,270
but then if you say you're into any sort
of conspiracy,

200
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:04,410
that automatically means you think nine
11 was an inside job and that the moon

201
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,243
was made out of cheese.

202
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,520
Well nine 11 is the best one because
this is the one that I was using.

203
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,110
My favorite one.
When people don't believe in

204
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,100
conspiracies,
I just say,

205
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:14,760
do you believe that nine 11 happened?
And they say yes.

206
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,470
Well then you believe in conspiracies
cause people conspired to fucking hijack

207
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,860
planes and fly them in a buildings that
doesn't just by my whole thing was that,

208
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,780
that you know that Americans were
involved.

209
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,250
And then that image,
give me a fucking break.

210
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,870
Okay,
right on it.

211
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,900
Right out the gate.
You gotta be like,

212
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,410
okay,
so who wants to fly it in and die

213
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,060
there?
God likes to do,

214
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,100
I mean you got to have an absolute
fucking nutjob do something like that.

215
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,700
So do you got to have them?
I mean,

216
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,520
I don't think we've ever even,
we've never had kamikaze is you now have

217
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,800
been able to get Americans to be like,
listen,

218
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,350
I'll go over there and try and fuck some
people up,

219
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:56,130
but if you think I'm going to fly some
shit into something or walk into a cafe,

220
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,350
strapped up with a bomb the fuck outta
here,

221
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,060
no Americans to Dadada,
we've had guys jump on grenades to save

222
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,880
other people to run into pizza hut.

223
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,400
And that's not our style.
That's not,

224
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,440
that's not our style.
We're not in a suicide bombing.

225
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,750
Yeah,
we're in to doing it from 60,000 feet,

226
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,170
calling it freedom with an x box.
No.

227
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,550
The funny thing about the original
suicide bombers,

228
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:20,930
the,
uh,

229
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,190
the kamikaze says there were all mapped
out.

230
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,010
I didn't realize that until a few years
ago.

231
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,850
I didn't even know that math was like an
important part of their diet back then.

232
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,980
I never saw that in the Ken Burns
documentary.

233
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,970
It's apparently of just a historical
fact.

234
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,310
And even there was a recent report on
Hitler.

235
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,480
Hitler himself was on,
uh,

236
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,240
a litany of medication and one of them
was meth.

237
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,940
They were giving a meth.
They would give meth to people,

238
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:47,940
but I can't fault him for that dude.
The amount of energy that that guy put

239
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:51,030
out during his speeches,
he needed something to level off.

240
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,670
Forget about,
forget about the screaming and yelling.

241
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,230
Just sitting that still
waiting for the right moment.

242
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,110
Building them into that.
That frenzy.

243
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,580
Do you ever watch that Michael Jackson
documentary right before he died,

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,760
when he drove,
just freeze after he did a dance move.

245
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,620
Let it simmer.
Let it simmer.

246
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,650
That's Hitler Shit.
Just sitting in that fucking chair.

247
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,790
Just getting him crazy.
Just wanting to hear or see the next

248
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,900
thing.
What's he gonna do?

249
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,210
It's timing.
It's fucking timing.

250
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,250
Some people do that on stage.
The Michael Jackson Hitler simmer

251
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,370
moment.
You would have to,

252
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,250
we got to do that tonight at the comedy
store.

253
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,680
All right,
we good?

254
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,960
Okay.
We've got to have this.

255
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,290
You got him.
Oh Dude.

256
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,210
If we had some of the technology,
I could be in your ear telling me keep

257
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,730
[inaudible].
You had to keep a straight face after a

258
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,850
punchline.
As you're looking down some fucked up

259
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,210
hose and I'm just going to let it
simmer,

260
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,270
let it simmer,
let it simmer and release.

261
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,860
So my dad was great.
Comedy clubs are filled with drugs and

262
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,793
it's nothing.

263
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,720
You know the thing about a guy like
Michael Jackson,

264
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,000
he's up there doing some shit you can't
do,

265
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,140
he spinning and moon walking and it's an
acrobatic event.

266
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,510
But you see a guy like you are a guy
like me on stage talking and you're

267
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,720
like,
I can fucking talk.

268
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,970
You know we all have to get a couple of
drinks.

269
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,850
Just kind of went out like we're going
to do roll call.

270
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,700
Yeah,
you have a couple of drinks.

271
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,070
I can fucking talk.
I know how to talk.

272
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,910
I can't moonwalk.
I could fuck a talk.

273
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,320
So you can't hold those,
those pauses to them.

274
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:27,530
It's like the green light fucking queer
that can help.

275
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:28,610
Right?
They can't help it.

276
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,420
Those big juicy pauses.
It's just this opening.

277
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,220
They could,
they could say something funny too,

278
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:36,640
like when it happens in a movie theater,
most of the time it's retarded.

279
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,510
But every now and then someone will yell
something out in a movie theater and

280
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,680
it's fucking hilarious.
Right.

281
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,970
And then that guy,
you know,

282
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,120
he becomes a hero for that crowd.
He just killed.

283
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,490
There's always that one guy doing the
sporting event.

284
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:52,000
So like now we'd like to take a moment
of silence for all the victims.

285
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,840
Yeah,
the fucking outhouse fire and everybody

286
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,490
shuts up and it's like,
just,

287
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,590
we just want you to remain quiet for 30
seconds.

288
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:00,880
It's always that guy.
20 seconds.

289
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:05,090
They just hear this guy go
like,

290
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,720
let's wrap it up.
I want to see what I came in to pay for.

291
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,000
Why do those fucking moments of silence?
Like she know you could do like a 10

292
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,490
count at a boxing match if a,
you know,

293
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,190
Lou Dibella dies or something like that.
Or one of those guys.

294
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:18,790
What was his name?

295
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,490
Lou was the,
the the famous guy that had like the

296
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:23,080
worst skin.
No,

297
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:23,441
no,
no.

298
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,100
There's this famous,
it's funny.

299
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:28,480
So I'm video flu,
Goddammit Wallach.

300
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,860
I don't remember the name I'll send her
was as new.

301
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:37,861
It's famous all throughout the grant.
1980s Easton's he used to train Meldrick

302
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,780
Taylor.
I don't remember.

303
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,820
Anyway,
the point is he looked like the most

304
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,840
unhealthy guy ever.
Who Do Va.

305
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,720
That's it.
Luke Duba.

306
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,100
You nailed it.
Pull up a picture of Lou do.

307
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,220
But just so everybody knows what the
fuck we're talking about.

308
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
But he was,
you know when he died,

309
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,260
I'm sure they had a a 10 count for a guy
like that.

310
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,250
A 10 count.
Okay.

311
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,900
But those fucking 30 seconds of silence.
Come on man.

312
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,870
He had to pay for that wonderful head of
hair,

313
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,180
man.
You have to see what this dude,

314
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:07,270
it looks like.
I don't remember what he page not found.

315
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,060
That's what they looked like.
He looked like an older Freddie Blassie

316
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,130
classy.
Freddie Blassie.

317
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,360
Nobody.
There he is.

318
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,620
Lil Duval.
Come on.

319
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,910
Come on.
Seriously.

320
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,210
That might be the most unhealthy looking
man that's ever lived.

321
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,710
Yeah,
but that's right towards the end,

322
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:24,550
Matt,
even 12 he had that Elvis here.

323
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,300
He did have some good hair.
Did Fonzie here phrase whole fucking

324
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,140
life.
I'm so jealous.

325
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,260
Anyway,
point being those moments that you do in

326
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:38,860
like that kind of a performance.
And plus if Michael Jackson's doing it

327
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,920
this fucking 30,000 people there and you
know,

328
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,390
at least 68 huge numbers.
Yeah.

329
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:48,340
What was like the biggest place he's
ever done?

330
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:49,690
It was probably like hundreds of
thousands.

331
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,370
The original family that owned the New
England

332
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,270
patriots,
they went bankrupt on the Michael

333
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,540
Jackson victory tour when he went out
with a,

334
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,790
with all of his brothers,
uh,

335
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,710
the sun put the thing together,
and I don't know if this is true,

336
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,130
so I got to preface this,
but a promoter in Boston told me this

337
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:10,070
cold forever.
Like Michael Jackson was going to go to

338
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:13,850
Foxboro stadium with a patriots were
playing and they promoted the show and

339
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,890
all the tickets and he had that would of
pay or play,

340
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:16,790
whatever they call,
no matter what,

341
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,490
you got to pay the guy.
And the town of Foxborough said,

342
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,590
no,
we don't want to show,

343
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,270
we don't want all these black people
coming out here.

344
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,920
All right.
That's what it was.

345
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,340
That's what it was.
I mean the white people got too crazy on

346
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:31,250
Monday night and they stopped having
Monday night football for like 20 years.

347
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,710
Like FoxPro was like,
then we're not having this really,

348
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:37,700
this is a quiet little town,
have you football game during the day on

349
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,750
Sunday and then get the fuck out of
here.

350
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,070
So they canceled the show and I thought
the,

351
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,530
the amount of money lost on that show,
they were close enough that that brought

352
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:48,980
him under.
But what this promoted was claiming was

353
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,870
this guy actually promoted the whole
tour.

354
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,740
And when he was doing the finances,
he didn't take into consideration how

355
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:58,760
big Michael Jackson stage was and how
many seats that that was going to eat

356
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,640
up.
He had this giant ass fucking stage that

357
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:05,150
was eating up like tens of thousands of
dollars a night times all of these

358
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,220
fucking dates.
And when he tried to get him go,

359
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:08,930
Hey Mike,
can you just have a smaller stage,

360
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,990
blah blah.
I guess he was competing with Prince and

361
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:14,420
was saying like now cause if I have a
smallest stage,

362
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,300
prince will have a bigger stage and I
got to make sure my shit is bigger than

363
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,280
his.
Of course you said that in a falsetto,

364
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,150
I don't know if this is true.

365
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,890
Right.
But like this is the story of this guy

366
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:23,510
told me,
it blew my mind.

367
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:28,310
I was like Oh I always thought they went
broke on just on one fucking date that

368
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:31,520
he canceled that and I just figured you
know there's 60,000 people there.

369
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:34,730
That's what reminded me talking about
60,000 people all paid that money and he

370
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,650
still had to give him a cut of that and
they just didn't have it.

371
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,430
That actually does make sense that the
the size of the stage thing.

372
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,290
That totally makes sense.
Yeah.

373
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,260
Cause there's a comedy club that did
that in New York where they,

374
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:48,680
for some reason they moved the stage out
away from the wall and now this little

375
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,950
small club and they moved it away from
the wall so the waitresses could walk

376
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,400
behind the stage behind this wall.
And like they took out like five or six

377
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:59,300
tables and all the other comedy clubs
were laughing and they figured out how

378
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,060
much money they fucked themselves out of
over the course of a year.

379
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,800
You know,
doing shows two or three shows a night

380
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:04,880
times six,
seven days.

381
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,150
Like they were fucking themselves out of
like three quarters of a million dollars

382
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,950
a year.
So they hadn't,

383
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,440
they,
they ended up having to move the wall.

384
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,510
Those fucking hilarious,
everybody from day one is just like,

385
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:17,510
this is stupid.
It was already one of those rooms that

386
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,460
was kind of shape.
It's not to celebrate was shaped like

387
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,580
the seller where it's like you're
standing sideways in a rectangle.

388
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,390
So you kinda got to angle yourself and
they took that shit and moved you

389
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:30,350
further into the crowd.
So it was almost like a year in the

390
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:31,550
round almost.
Yeah,

391
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,980
but only on,
but the people who are at two sides,

392
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,810
this is a place like that in San
Francisco.

393
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,280
There's a theater that I did.
It's like that.

394
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:39,560
It's weird.
You walk the stage goes out into the

395
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,870
crowd and like,
so people are behind you.

396
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,910
And to the left and behind you and to
the right.

397
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,220
It's very strange.
You did that thing with me,

398
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:46,591
right?
Yeah.

399
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:47,810
Yeah.
That was weird.

400
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,660
Right.
I know that you have,

401
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:51,420
I want to be sitting behind a
performance.

402
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,640
No,
well I'm doing a theater in the round

403
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,660
in,
in Phoenix.

404
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,160
Just collaborative theater.
Yeah.

405
00:17:56,161 --> 00:18:00,120
Just cause it would be weird now that I
do it five times before you do,

406
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,351
Oh,
you've done this before.

407
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:06,351
I just start the joke on this side and
then turn an end on that side and I just

408
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:11,601
really try to be conscious of sections.
Like Dane said,

409
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,340
the most brilliant thing about the,
uh,

410
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,640
the,
the theater in the round,

411
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,930
he goes,
it's for theaters.

412
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,660
Just look at it that way.
It's four theaters just all stuck

413
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:21,140
together and you just sorta performing
one theater.

414
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,910
Then this one and then that went over
there and then I just think you do it

415
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,744
like the,
the,

416
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,570
the three card Monte,
he just sort of switch it up like you

417
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:28,340
don't,
right,

418
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,770
right,
right.

419
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,910
As you go around.
But I know,

420
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,690
I know people that have seen comics I'll
do is theater in the round.

421
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,360
They'll be like,
so and so was here and he didn't move

422
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:37,141
it.
Not One of those comics,

423
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:39,240
it's just standing with the mic and the
mic stand.

424
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,050
So they were in the back and just
sitting there and one of them had like a

425
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:46,770
slow turning stage.
So eventually you just send that dude 20

426
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,560
more jokes.
He's going to be looking at us.

427
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:53,190
So he made the stage turn while they
have a stage that turns.

428
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:56,490
And I think that's for musical acts.
We have a drama drunk kid in amps

429
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,410
planted,
so they're not moving,

430
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:01,650
but it's also for,
I think like performance who just want

431
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:05,540
to stand there and not move around.
It's fun around like they're wrote a

432
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,190
fucking carousel.
You did that one very slowly.

433
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,830
Very slowly.
It spins around the one that turns

434
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:11,730
though.
Yeah.

435
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:13,840
But it turns very slowly.
Very slowly.

436
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:14,990
It's the same place.
Yeah.

437
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,770
The celebrity theater.
That's the one we're talking about.

438
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,330
Yeah.
I forgot that it turns.

439
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,500
Yeah,
they asked me the option,

440
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,800
do you want the stage turned on?
Um,

441
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,870
I'm definitely gonna say yes.
Oh,

442
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,280
I always say no.
It's like I don't need,

443
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,020
I don't need that.
I want to just for,

444
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,970
cause it's weird.
Yeah.

445
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,640
Well if they can speed it up,
you could literally just be running in

446
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,770
place doing a whole fucking choke
running against it.

447
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,780
My goal is to do so many shots while
months,

448
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,780
days that I can't figure out where the
stool is at any given time.

449
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,400
It can be anywhere.
It's moving around.

450
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,470
No.
Well I was going to say,

451
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,110
no way.
I've been drunk twice on stage.

452
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,830
It was twice,
twice and 20 something years.

453
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,410
Yeah.
It's not the best move every now and

454
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,330
then though.
It's the right thing to do once I was in

455
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:55,980
Ireland.
So that's not my fault.

456
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,090
And the other time I was coming back
from a Yankees Red Sox game and didn't

457
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:02,160
know it was going to have a show and
somebody called up,

458
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,000
hey,
I had a falling out,

459
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:07,020
can you come down and do the show?
And I thought it was sober.

460
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,801
One of those like,
yeah,

461
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:08,211
Hey,
I'll do it.

462
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:09,300
And I just went up there and I was just
like,

463
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:09,780
she's,
yeah,

464
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,370
should I heard?
And I was just like,

465
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,360
oh shit.
I had to slow way down and had a very,

466
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:19,200
very uh,
subpar fucking shows bad.

467
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,080
So you had a slow way down just to get
your mouth to work right?

468
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,270
Yes.
Which killed the timing of everything.

469
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,910
So I,
I bombed very slowly.

470
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,390
I see that with um,
that the term punch drunk.

471
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,700
That's like a term that people don't
like.

472
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,950
But that's a,
that's exactly what it's like.

473
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,030
That same thing where you know you're a
little fucked up so you have to struggle

474
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,730
to get your words out.
But you could see that in fighters it's

475
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,400
exact same thing.
It's why they call it punch drunk.

476
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,750
It's not just,
they sound like they're drunk,

477
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,130
but the same thing like you have to
struggle

478
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,090
to control your situation and then when
those guys get drunk,

479
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,800
that's when you see guys that are really
punched drunk guys that had been punched

480
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:59,110
drunk get drunk.
Cause then you see they have a hard side

481
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,010
because they have a really hard time
controlling the words then that it's

482
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,840
just a,
it's a mangled mess.

483
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,140
It's hard to understand the,
that

484
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,120
that UFC,
the a,

485
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:11,020
what do you call when they stick them in
the house and all that shit.

486
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,390
Ultimate fighter,
the ultimate fighter and it's all women.

487
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,580
And like I remember last time I did your
podcast,

488
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:18,430
I was against it like women in the
octagon.

489
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,560
It's like they,
they like why would you do that?

490
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,420
They're beautiful.
Why would you punch each other in the

491
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:23,750
face?
And I want to see a jab.

492
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,090
Do you have breasts and shed?
It's just,

493
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:28,690
I didn't want to see it and now I don't
even notice it anymore.

494
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,390
And it's,
it's unbelievably fucking entertaining.

495
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,870
You don't notice that the girls anymore.
Now I know they're great fights and it's

496
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:41,020
guys who are already good at talking
shit and fucking not liking each other,

497
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,570
but they're just women.
Just take it to that extra fucking

498
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,790
level,
that shit talking.

499
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,860
And then the fact that they can beat the
fuck out of you.

500
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,850
And then it's funny there's a guy to be
just watching it going like there is not

501
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,430
one woman in this house that I could
even get on the floor.

502
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,400
Like these women would all just mop the
floor with me.

503
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,100
There's a fucking hilarious youtube
video.

504
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,370
Somebody tweeted it to me and I don't,
I don't know,

505
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,230
I just lost it in the ether.
It was this girl,

506
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,330
it just starts writing in.
It was almost one of those six second

507
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,950
videos,
whatever the fucking kids call him.

508
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,860
And you knew this kid had a little bit
of training and this girl had more

509
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:15,190
training and she came at him and it was
like she climbed up his body,

510
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,790
like stepped on his fucking thigh and
then was behind them.

511
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,220
And the video ends with him just
grabbing like,

512
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,720
this is its rear naked girl.
You know,

513
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:25,330
he was out before he went and the whole
Party just goes,

514
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,960
oh,
and it ends and I fucking died laughing.

515
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,610
But going like I wouldn't even have
lasted as long is that kid did.

516
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:37,000
Cause it seemed like he knew a little
bit of a defense.

517
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,000
A little bit of defense like I have a
great Rhonda Rousey.

518
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:43,660
Bit of like what it would be like to
date her if she was actually physically

519
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:45,910
abusive,
but I just can't do the prat fall.

520
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,250
I want to act like you know her big
movies.

521
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,870
She does that fucking throw and you go
over a hip and just you fucking landed

522
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,150
on the ground.
You're like in a relationship with her.

523
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,890
Oh our bar real mature.
Showing you like I know I tapped out.

524
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,340
That doesn't mean because you're right.
I didn't want my heart broken and then

525
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,350
she comes out.
You got to knock down the stool to try

526
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,670
to have something in between you and
her.

527
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,660
I think it took like that probably has
to date a fighter.

528
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,620
If I had to guess.
She probably has to date some guy who

529
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:16,200
also knows how to do what she does.
I just couldn't imagine

530
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,050
Jen a fight data.
I'd be on the kitchen like an apron just

531
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:22,290
like make her an her food and shit.
I just couldn't get me.

532
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,130
Look at me sideways.
You'd fuck me up.

533
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,950
Almost every female fighter does.
They all date fighters.

534
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,080
They just does.
Just seems like,

535
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,590
you know a girl being in a position like
that where she could just beat the fuck

536
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,480
out of her boyfriend.
I don't think chicks like that.

537
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,680
That's,
I never looked at it that way cause I

538
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,160
always thought it was hilarious.
Like I,

539
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,980
I,
I could date somebody like that.

540
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:43,620
I would think it was funny that they can
kick the shit and one of my guy friends

541
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:44,371
gave me shit.
I'd be like,

542
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:45,500
yeah man,
she kicked shit out of me.

543
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,660
And you,
I think it's funny but like I never

544
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,780
looked at it like,
cause even though they are like,

545
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,090
like these lethal weapons now there is
still there could possibly still I

546
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:57,560
should say,
I don't want to speak for him that this

547
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:02,150
female male relationship where that they
still want the guy to be able to protect

548
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:06,020
them and it's just kind of like uh yeah
dude that's funny.

549
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,210
Cause then they're just sort of
rendering you useless cause they're

550
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,300
already making a zillion dollars.
So there goes your on providing I can

551
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:13,010
protect you and do what I can kick your
ass.

552
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,720
And then I can also have a kid.
So you're basically now like a 45 year

553
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:21,400
old teenager,
which just gives you a little height

554
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,640
chair.
You know what I like about watching it?

555
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,720
Like self sustained unit?
I think it's fucking awesome.

556
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,010
What I like about watching female fights
is the,

557
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:32,810
they're more reliant on technique
because they don't have overwhelming

558
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:35,930
physical strength,
but there are certain guys that have

559
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:40,070
overwhelming physical strength and
abilities you can plow through.

560
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,740
Yeah.
They could just defects in that game.

561
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,550
Yeah,
they can muscle things.

562
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:45,410
They can,
they just hit really hard.

563
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,420
So sometimes they have like shitty
technique.

564
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:50,480
They throw windmill punches,
but with a lot of women,

565
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,840
what you're getting is you're getting
the purest technique.

566
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:54,390
You can,
again,

567
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,570
it
depends on where you're head is a

568
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,090
gentleman with my opponent given plenty
of time to see it coming

569
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,750
and let them know the couches are always
coming from the same direction.

570
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,240
If he see the left,
the next one's the right.

571
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,720
Have you see the right?
The next one?

572
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,050
Yeah.
Don't get tricky.

573
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:14,270
What's fucking dumb?
You're less linear story.

574
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,220
This isn't Tarantino.
We're dancing here.

575
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,630
Okay.
Left right,

576
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:18,464
left,
right.

577
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,570
But with checks,
they're,

578
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:24,740
they're forced to use more tech mean the
obviously there's,

579
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,760
there's a curve as far as like physical
strength is like someone like Serena

580
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,470
Williams.
So obviously a very physically strong

581
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:33,560
girl and there's other girls that are
like not as physically strong,

582
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,750
you know,
throw me over a couch and you know,

583
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:40,590
when you hit the window like sideways
and then slide that she's so land on

584
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:45,170
some gym shoes pressive like her legs
and the strength that she has,

585
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,030
I was at,
I was at a party one time,

586
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:49,160
uh,
some agency I used to be at and they

587
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,980
also represented her and you forget your
agency also represents,

588
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:53,170
you know,
athletes cause they want to like

589
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,900
fucking,
you know,

590
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,850
make money off of selling to readers or
whatever.

591
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,970
Right.
And she was at the party with a

592
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:00,500
basketball player,
so he was like,

593
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,810
you know,
so they were probably a portion couple,

594
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,390
like I felt like a dwarf dude.
Like she was like,

595
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,340
uh,
just like,

596
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,310
it was totally gorgeous.
Totally in proportion,

597
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:11,980
just like,
like super athlete.

598
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,560
Do Marvel Comic,
uh,

599
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,470
bodies that's like on like,
dude,

600
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:19,620
you should be wearing a fucking cape.
It just,

601
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:20,810
no,
and it's just,

602
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,180
you know,
you just see people like that and you

603
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,050
just go like,
oh yeah,

604
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:26,770
that's why like you always sit there in
the back of your head as you watching

605
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,100
some quarterback.
That sucks.

606
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,910
What if I did some more setups?
What if I get thrown against my body

607
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:34,130
like fucking Brett far,
but not throw an interception.

608
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,110
And then you actually run into the real
athletes do.

609
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:38,810
When I saw Joe Theismann who always
looked like a little fella,

610
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,041
you know,
when he was out there,

611
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,200
he had the one little bar here,
he got his leg broken.

612
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,920
He just,
he always looked just so small.

613
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:47,130
When he was out there,
I saw the guy and like in a mall,

614
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,870
he's like six one in like still jacked.
I'm like almost five,

615
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:52,800
10.
I'm just going like,

616
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,230
this guy would fucking drop me.
How did he,

617
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:56,970
uh,
did he get his leg fixed to,

618
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:00,340
they put bars in it and pins and shit.
Like how did he get his legs fixed?

619
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,300
I imagine I haven't been in contact with
the,

620
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,600
did anybody at the hospital,
did that end his career?

621
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:07,520
That was my,
my question.

622
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:09,740
Yes it did.
That was the last play he watched.

623
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,340
He said,
I'm on what time you said he watched the

624
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:13,710
replay one time.
Uh,

625
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:15,370
and that was,
that was it for him and uh,

626
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,230
and I actually win a silver,
broke his leg.

627
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:22,500
I think that reminded me of that,
that compound fracture of just like,

628
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,460
oh my God.

629
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,910
Oh my God,
I can't even imagine the pain.

630
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,540
And then going into the shock.
And then the fact now is he's coming

631
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,650
back,
right Silva's.

632
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:36,060
Yeah.
January is to fucking sit there after

633
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:39,270
you went through that and to just the
first time you start throwing kicks with

634
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:43,410
that leg again.
Just like the level of whatever that is.

635
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,540
I don't have that anywhere in my life.
Like if I ever fucking broke my leg like

636
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,430
that doing stand up,
that's it.

637
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,280
I would,
I would be,

638
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,940
I'd open a comedy club used to go up on
stage.

639
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,500
I know I don't,
I don't want to do that anymore.

640
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,500
He's at the end of his career.
He's got a few years left fighting and

641
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,000
uh,
he has an opportunity to still make a

642
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:05,300
lot of money and I think he's probably
just going to make as much money as you

643
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:07,040
can over the next few years and then get
out.

644
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,210
Now what,
what is the,

645
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,820
that that rumor that I hear that if you
break a bone,

646
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,720
this is such a bother heal stronger and
heal stronger to sort of,

647
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,200
I mean it's less likely to break in the
area where it broke.

648
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,610
It's less likely to break there.
It gets knotted up and thick,

649
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,380
but not necessarily sure it gets
stronger.

650
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,780
Thank you doctor Brogan and say,
why am I asking you these fucking

651
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:29,330
questions?
Do know a lot about broken bones.

652
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:34,331
This is how I learned all of my shit.
Asking people who don't have the job,

653
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,930
asking ups,
get all those packages to everybody

654
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:40,940
overnight.
If you ever have questions like that and

655
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:43,280
you want answers,
ask Brian Cowen and even if he doesn't

656
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,170
know the answer,
he'll fucking keep going.

657
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,380
He will come up with something that's a
logical just insecurity of just not

658
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,810
knowing the answer.
He just has to fucking answer.

659
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,450
He'll fuck it.
Argue about some shit.

660
00:28:56,451 --> 00:29:01,030
He's not educated at all
I love,

661
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,900
but he also has a shitload of fucking
information is had.

662
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,780
Brian is like one of the best I've ever
right.

663
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,750
Met At being able to pull quotes out of
the air about books that he's read like

664
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,760
constantly.
He's writing book hang with him from

665
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:13,481
one,
three minutes.

666
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:14,960
You realize he's out of his fucking
mind.

667
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,580
He's crazy.
He just gets the best everything.

668
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,770
I love him.
I love him,

669
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,480
but he's out.
He's out of his fucking mind.

670
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,020
There's definitely crazy.
He's fucking mind is going like a

671
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:26,650
thousand rpms constantly.
Whenever I talked to him.

672
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,060
You just got to do the alley.
You lay against the ropes and just let

673
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,420
all the information come at you and then
you get them with one and then you come

674
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:34,871
back.
Oh,

675
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:38,940
and by the way we can do it.
He got a pair of shoulders on you.

676
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,670
How would he to do at that point?
Is that what is hanging off of,

677
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:41,820
you know,
I bet you got to be sign.

678
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,490
Yeah.

679
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,330
Yeah.
And a piece on Ya.

680
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,000
I went hunting with him.
It was five.

681
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,080
I mean I've done it three times now.
It's five days of gay jokes.

682
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,280
Fish by not shutting up.
You really should be here.

683
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:55,660
People are gonna think I don't like him.
I love him.

684
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,030
I love him.
I just like trashing him.

685
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,330
He knows what he does.
That's part of his charm is that he

686
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:04,090
likes to make fun of himself.
Did he go out and talk to the bear and

687
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:06,010
ask him what he's doing to get those
back muscles?

688
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,360
He would
almost as big as mine.

689
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,430
I got mad.
I got to find out.

690
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,580
But we were for five days.
If I walked around on all fours and

691
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,860
occasionally stood up,
I like a beer.

692
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,080
I'd be like a bear without all that
hair.

693
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,450
Five days,
every time.

694
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,050
It's just constantly the Brian Count
show cause you could just wind them up.

695
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:30,820
He's just that guy.
He's always on.

696
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,590
He's never not funny.
Like he's never,

697
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,210
I never called Bryon.
He's depressed,

698
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,910
you know.
If he is depressed and be depressed for

699
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:40,060
a couple of minutes and then it'll just
start talking about something and it'll

700
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:45,061
tell you start talking about lean muscle
mass or how he's built for dance and

701
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,540
he'll just go into something and then
next thing you know you're laughing.

702
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,060
He just doesn't want that uncomfortable
silence.

703
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,351
No.
He's like,

704
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,460
what's his face at the end of the hulk?
Feel big speed instead of walking away

705
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:59,740
from the town.
Those were his troubles.

706
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,180
Do you know that the hulk,
they changed.

707
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,200
I just want to keep trashing him until
people show them this clip.

708
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:10,950
Two I get on his show again.
They changed the hoax name by the way,

709
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,450
the piece of salt now that's from uh,
the,

710
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:15,400
the hippie warehouse.

711
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,140
These ideas,
the salt crystal lamps,

712
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:24,460
they're supposed to and somehow or
another like generate positive ions and

713
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,010
Salsify,
the air float through the air and make

714
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,930
you feel better.
They changed.

715
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,550
Robert Banner was a bill Bixby
characters name on the hulk,

716
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,130
but the real,
the real name is Bruce Banner.

717
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,680
Right.
But they changed it from Bruce to Robert

718
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:43,330
for TV because they thought Bruce is a
gaining Bruce.

719
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,990
How did it bro?
You angry again?

720
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,310
I'll get mad.
Right?

721
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:53,140
God Green last night it was don thing
and you ruined your pants again.

722
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,250
Bruce become a gaming.
It's like Bruce for the long.

723
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,260
For the longest time it was like,
you know Bruce,

724
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,680
I was going to say Bruce Jenner,
but I guess that's a bad example now.

725
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,740
It was a good example a few years back
to that guy.

726
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,720
What's going on?
He's such a good looking guy.

727
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,221
Yeah,
no,

728
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:09,880
it was never anything wrong with his
nose.

729
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,490
He's becoming a good looking older lady
though.

730
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,620
That's what's going on.
Hey,

731
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:15,880
God bless them.
If it makes him happy,

732
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,090
God bless him.
If it makes him happy,

733
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,230
I just,
I just don't.

734
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,070
Just watching people fucking age badly.
Oh,

735
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,630
attack in their face.
Yeah.

736
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,000
It's a weird thing that people do.
They get,

737
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,060
they want to change it and then they
think when they changed that it looks

738
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,770
better.
It just looks different for the most

739
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:34,480
part.
How much of a hug do you need if you're

740
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,920
staring at your throat in the mirror,
like sideways holding America.

741
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,210
And I don't like my Adam's apple,
like I don't think I've,

742
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,820
I don't know what my Adam's apple look,
I couldn't pick up my Adam's apple and a

743
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:46,250
fucking lineup.
I don't think I've ever looked at it.

744
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,940
I think his deal,
and I'm just guessing is that he's

745
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:52,580
probably transitioning to being a woman.

746
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,460
If I had to guess.
I think,

747
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,540
I think that's a probably a pretty safe
estimate at this point.

748
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,880
He's grown his hair long.
His nails are long.

749
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:04,250
He had is now,
do you think he'll come back [inaudible]

750
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,770
name or do you think he'll just got
fingernail Polish on now?

751
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:09,500
Man.
Do you think he'll,

752
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,750
he'll uh,
he'll,

753
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:12,890
he'll go with a,
um,

754
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,480
a new name,
like three Cema.

755
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,301
Yes.
I'm saying,

756
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:22,301
do you think he'll go hacky and just
make his name of feminine like Bill,

757
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,880
Bill Arena?
Like Betty has a fucking full character

758
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,220
that he,
that he becomes when it becomes,

759
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
let me see,
let me put,

760
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,160
bring it back up.
Bring it back up.

761
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:32,450
Those nails.
I mean,

762
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,040
first of all,
if this is fake,

763
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,040
he looks like a Jennifer.
You think so?

764
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:39,170
I would say Claudia.
Nah,

765
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,950
he's not a Claudia.
I was going to say he looks like a

766
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:43,784
Claudia.

767
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,860
Look at him.
He's got a cigarette.

768
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,680
Susan or a Jennifer.
So he's smoking cigarettes to

769
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,861
look at him right here.
Yeah.

770
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,200
We all know gay people.
They're always smoking cigarettes.

771
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,850
That's what is happening.
I think that looks like that's a pretty

772
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,590
good picture of what he probably looks
like.

773
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,370
He has like his lipstick on when no
one's looking and he's tucking.

774
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,910
That's bad.
He looks like he looks like an older

775
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,970
lead singer of a band and they're doing
the casino circuit.

776
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,780
The earrings too.
It's like he really,

777
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,730
he seems to be coming.
A woman seems to be becoming one good

778
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:20,241
for him.
Yeah.

779
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:25,241
I mean this is a good time to be a lady
is a good time to be a transgender woman

780
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,740
to,
you know,

781
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:29,720
people are more accepting of it than
ever before.

782
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,050
It's a good time for me,
but it's,

783
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,380
I mean
it should,

784
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:37,280
but it should bother you.

785
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,290
It should not really.
Should not.

786
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,900
It should not.
You know,

787
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,630
having said that,
I hate the color of his nail Polish.

788
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,720
The red is my favorite.
I feel like if you're going to fail,

789
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:50,930
he's that he's that type that's too racy
for,

790
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:53,870
I don't mind it.
He's an Olympic medalist.

791
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,470
What do you think you should have black
go golf.

792
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,090
I think he needs an edge.
I think he's just a little too soft.

793
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,670
Like God's got his hair blown out.
I wouldn't,

794
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:09,500
if I had to do a makeover,
less scarves,

795
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,630
less flowing shit.
And I,

796
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:12,920
yeah,
he needs an edge man.

797
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,030
Poor God.
Look at him.

798
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,140
He's wearing those visors,
this old lady tennis visors.

799
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,200
If you're not a hunter s Thompson and
they don't say that Vegas on them.

800
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,620
Take that fucking thing off.
That was the picture of absolute bliss

801
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:25,910
though.
I think he wants to do it.

802
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,070
That's what he wants to do.
Well listen,

803
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,310
he's been with those crazy bitches for
so long.

804
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:33,530
He became one.
I mean,

805
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,330
that's really what it is.
I think it's a little more,

806
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,920
I think they tricked him.
Joe.

807
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:38,070
I think they could put you in that

808
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,510
house.
And I don't think you're coming out

809
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:42,420
looking like that.
I probably would imagine if,

810
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:46,950
I did imagine if it was proven that if
you're around women like that many women

811
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,320
long enough,
they slowly but surely Ab your

812
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,600
masculinity away.
Do you want to become a woman?

813
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,080
Okay.

814
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,860
If it's proven that like we,
we imitate our atmosphere so much that

815
00:35:56,861 --> 00:36:00,750
one more around the opposite sex for two
months or one of those people that view

816
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,520
a,
what's that psychological word?

817
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:04,810
They say that you're a,
a,

818
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:08,800
you're codependent and you know,
you got to watch out who you hang out

819
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:10,060
with.
They're pretty soon you're doing what

820
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:14,020
they're doing and next thing you know,
you know there are people like you want

821
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:16,480
a pleated skirt,
you'd like some uggs probably starts

822
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:19,720
with the eggs.
I think it starts to feet it the feet

823
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:22,930
first head of curious and then you,
your work your way up your body if

824
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,400
you're easing into it.
Yeah,

825
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:27,020
because people aren't going to notice
that

826
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,360
time.
One time I got a manicure,

827
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,640
I fucking hated it.
Did you get angry?

828
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,721
No,
I just,

829
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:36,230
I didn't like it.
Pain.

830
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,540
I didn't.
Why didn't you like it?

831
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,470
Well,
I was on,

832
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,960
I was on the road with the,
uh,

833
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,990
Charlie Murphy and Don l and it's
acceptable in the,

834
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,970
uh,
amongst black guys to get your fucking

835
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:50,050
nails done.
Right.

836
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,190
It's like considered some pimp shit.
So like you got to do it.

837
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:55,870
So I've literally sitting there,

838
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:56,600
okay,

839
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,280
next Charlie like this with my hand in
the thing and I'm lab bill Byrd is the

840
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:02,114
way to do it.
No,

841
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,190
he was laughing too because I just kept
saying,

842
00:37:04,191 --> 00:37:06,950
this is the most feminist fucking thing
I've ever done.

843
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:10,390
Forget about doing it with you who's
just overloaded with testosterone.

844
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:10,941
Say,
Charlie,

845
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:14,030
you need to do this so you don't win.
Mill kicked somebody.

846
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,440
I don't know.
I'm more in the middle.

847
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,900
I don't need to do this.
And I was on stage that night and I was

848
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,610
just going like this.
I was self conscious.

849
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,320
I got the,
I got the clear,

850
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,840
I got the clear fetish and they were
just like,

851
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,890
glistening.
Yeah.

852
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:27,590
But then what sucks is then it starts to
peel.

853
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,840
So then he just,
he had just fucking scratch and then it

854
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:33,530
looks gross.
Did you try to prematurely age it?

855
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,660
Do you like maybe get some sandpaper and
rubber?

856
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,900
I was doing all,
I was super homophobic about it.

857
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,230
Fingers in the dirt.
Like fisting the dirt.

858
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,740
Yeah.
Trying to get the nail Polish off now I

859
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:50,690
found somebody with one of those gravel
driveways isn't a fun thing in the

860
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,140
African American community getting your
toes and nails done.

861
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,190
Like this picture's a dude's like
getting their toes done on the cell

862
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:01,430
phone.
No talking Aubrey with this Alpha now I

863
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:01,941
remember that.
Yeah.

864
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:04,640
No it wasn't really his was his friend's
company,

865
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:05,930
but yeah,
he was a part of it.

866
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,541
Yeah.
No they,

867
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,660
they,
they take being cleaned to a whole

868
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,510
nother level and is generally speaking,
some of 'em think white people are

869
00:38:11,511 --> 00:38:15,920
pretty filthy.
That was a trend in MMA fighters for the

870
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:17,840
longest time was getting their nails
done.

871
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:20,840
Like chocolate.
Dell started out [inaudible] is funny,

872
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,480
man colored pink and I thought it was to
me,

873
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:25,960
that's fucking funny cause you can kick
the shit out of somebody.

874
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:26,760
That's that.
Yeah.

875
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,510
Way that Bruce Lee story.
What's stuff that he used to walk around

876
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:32,790
wherever the fuck he was from even go
into the city and he would act all the

877
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:36,010
feminine so people would fuck with them
and then he'd beat the shit

878
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,440
out of him and his friend would say,
why did you do that?

879
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,510
And he said,
because if I just kicked his ass,

880
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:43,690
he could get over it.
But if some of feminine guy kicked his

881
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:44,980
ass,
that's going to stay with them.

882
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,550
And I want that to be true.
I can give you the,

883
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,800
the whatever the book is.
The Bruce Lee book is a,

884
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,810
it has a red cover.
I can never remember the name of it and

885
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,290
a black and white photo and he's like
this and just fucking shredded.

886
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,080
Yeah,
he was across to all the other Bruce Lee

887
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:00,790
photos where he's like 20 pounds
overweight.

888
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,380
Sorry.
I would think that he would probably be

889
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:07,240
a guy who would come up with a bunch of
different real life scenarios just to

890
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,610
test as martial arts and to,
to,

891
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,440
you know,
becoming a feminine guy and have guys

892
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:12,280
try to beat your ass.

893
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,860
It seems like a good move.
It's pretty bad ass.

894
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:18,190
I think it's a smart move because most
people spend their lives right here.

895
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,650
Avoiding physical confrontations.
It's like,

896
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:21,760
you know,
you know once,

897
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:24,700
once people really started gaining
weight and fucking bloody noses and

898
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:25,810
broke,
busted eye sockets,

899
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:26,940
I tapped out.
I was just like,

900
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,790
I'm going to tell some jokes.
If you,

901
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:33,580
the only way to really test it is to
test in a real life situation.

902
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,880
There's a lot of people that look really
good in the gym and then when it comes

903
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,730
to an actual fight,
they just fall apart and panic.

904
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,280
They just can't do it.
I just think that you need that.

905
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:43,810
You got to have a couple of days that's
like,

906
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,100
you know,
for some drinks,

907
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,790
no,
you gotta,

908
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,950
you gotta have a couple of fights and
hopefully survive them.

909
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,560
Yeah.
If you don't have a fight,

910
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,450
and if you ever,
you ever seen someone get in a fight

911
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:54,760
that's never been in a fight before and
go into a full panic?

912
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,330
No.
I think I've told this story before,

913
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:01,120
but it was at the comedy store.
We're sitting on the patio and there was

914
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:03,730
this guy,
this black guy in a white guy,

915
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:07,300
they were fighting in front of the House
of Blues and the yelling at each other

916
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,900
and it turns physical and as it turns
physical,

917
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,380
the white guy is in full on fucking
panic mode.

918
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,560
His eyes are closed and he's literally,
was this me flailing this way?

919
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,220
Like this way,
like not moving his shoulders,

920
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,880
but his arms are like,
like he's boxing the guy's ears.

921
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,020
That's what he's doing right.
Left,

922
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:29,560
right,
left.

923
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,550
I mean his hands are open.
He's just absolutely in a full panic.

924
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,250
And then a bus pulls in front of them
and then I don't get to see what the

925
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,620
fuck happened.
The bus moves past,

926
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:42,460
the guys laid out flat out called the
black guy's nowhere to be found.

927
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,440
The white guys fucking dead,
stiff,

928
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:46,090
knocked out.
People are freaking out.

929
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,270
So obviously he got hit.
I have no idea what happened.

930
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,200
Is this bad?
That's a bad,

931
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,750
that's not your face,
right?

932
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,690
Terrible technique.
It doesn't hurt your opponent.

933
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,090
Double Time.
It's the good thing about it is you

934
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:59,530
being very ethical,
like you're not,

935
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:00,820
you know,
harming your opponent.

936
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,580
You're involved in a physical
altercation but you're not going to do

937
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:05,110
any damage.
Just want to say is you don't wanna hurt

938
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:07,960
your hands punching somebody skull or
you don't want to fuck up your manicure.

939
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,010
Snoop Dogg Snoop Dogg has his nails did.
Wow.

940
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,460
He's gets French tips I guess.
Different colors.

941
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,541
White,
black,

942
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,374
white,
black.

943
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,450
Yeah.
Okay.

944
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,040
He's snoop Dogg.
He can do it.

945
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,000
Remember when Tate used to do his nails?
Tate used to have colored nails.

946
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,170
That whole Alpha Nail Polish thing.
Those,

947
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,480
there's a lot of dummies that we're
doing that for awhile they all got off

948
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:32,900
of it.
Roger worked had,

949
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,823
yeah.
That's

950
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,640
the type of shit that like when you
almost start dressing like a chick,

951
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,630
like you actually get more pussy.
Like more women come out.

952
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,920
Like that rock star thing,
that Androgynous fucking look.

953
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,350
You stop borrowing that close and next
thing you know that blowing you.

954
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,070
That's how I heard it went down.
What's really funny is that and hit

955
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:52,910
parade is pre like Reddit,
like Judas priest started a lot of the

956
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,710
metal stuff.
Rob Halford,

957
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,460
you know all the SLM dressing s and m
dressing and people didn't realize he

958
00:41:58,461 --> 00:41:59,870
was gay as fuck.
Right?

959
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:01,780
Yeah.
I had no idea rob Hoffman was gay as

960
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:06,410
fuck and he got all of these guys to
essentially dress like gay s and m guys.

961
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,940
Yeah.
Like that was what became the luck is

962
00:42:08,941 --> 00:42:11,000
brilliant,
but that's so much of a bad

963
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:11,990
motherfucker.
He is.

964
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:17,230
He made people kind of
one of the great front man and then

965
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:21,890
nothing too he,
he basically was completely 100% other

966
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:25,370
than Freddie Mercury,
who was literally in a band called Queen

967
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,730
and we're just so dumb.

968
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,241
Like,
no,

969
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:31,420
he's fine.
He's straight.

970
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,600
He sings good.
That's all.

971
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:36,110
Don't be homophobic
like it matters.

972
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,400
Yeah.
I have to ta do funny.

973
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:40,110
Mark,
you and me,

974
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,890
that fucking guy that live aid set is
one of the,

975
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,390
I would put that up against anybody's
performance ever.

976
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,690
Oh,
he was a bad mother fucker,

977
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,370
dude.
He turned Wembley Stadium into a fucking

978
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:54,350
coffee house.
He had them.

979
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,500
Everybody like the fucking back row that
had,

980
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:00,530
that guy was unbelievable.
He was sensational.

981
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,720
He was a really unique talent.
Like,

982
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,590
like there was no one like him before
because he was such a combination of

983
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:11,360
like masculinity and femininity and exp.
I never noticed any of that.

984
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:13,070
I was just like,
this fucking guy.

985
00:43:13,071 --> 00:43:14,840
You can't stop watching him and his,
his,

986
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:15,561
his,
his,

987
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:18,240
uh,
his singing was incredible and he was

988
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,140
better live as good as the albums
worries.

989
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,840
One of the few guys that was actually
fucking better live.

990
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,810
I haven't seen anybody come close to
that guy.

991
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,233
Wow.
Since,

992
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,660
wow,
that's a strong,

993
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,330
anybody you got anybody that could fuck
fucking hold 100,000 people in the palm

994
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:37,520
of his hand after he had to follow all
those other beasts.

995
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,110
You know,
it's true.

996
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,330
You had to go and have to Robert Plant
Jimmy page.

997
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:43,190
I went,
didn't go well that was the one that was

998
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:45,890
one of the ones that didn't go out,
which is why 2007 went so well because

999
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,030
they were like,
we can't do that again.

1000
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,400
They put it together the last fucking
second.

1001
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:53,570
And then you had like say they had,
did they had to dramas at the sink.

1002
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:57,170
Can you please whisper that in my ear
during my act and are

1003
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,210
you were,
you were the first guy to call me up.

1004
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,200
You called me up and left a message
about Zeplin you called me.

1005
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,550
I'd be like,
you're not going to fucking believe

1006
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,650
this,
but you got to go devastating.

1007
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:11,660
Go on Youtube.
You're not going to fucking believe

1008
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:12,860
this.
They stole everything.

1009
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,530
They fucking stole away that I was
saying that they fucking,

1010
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:18,050
this this thing they called the song
remains the same.

1011
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:20,120
And they was showing how many dude there
right now going,

1012
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,620
going to trial.
Yup.

1013
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,320
On Stairway to heaven.
And you call me about this.

1014
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:26,830
It was many years of dating to me.
I still love John Bottom.

1015
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,330
I actually still loved that music
because I still have all cause it is

1016
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,920
still great and I still,
and I,

1017
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,000
all those childhood memories of where I
was when I,

1018
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,370
when I was going on,
but like I,

1019
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:36,510
you know,
it's like the Cosby thing.

1020
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:37,410
He just hope it isn't true.

1021
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,310
Well,
the Zeppelin thing to me.

1022
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,110
Yeah.
With a riff raping women.

1023
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,750
That latest one with the [inaudible]

1024
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:47,740
worse.
Yeah.

1025
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,261
The,
the,

1026
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:50,440
the Cosby thing is very different
obviously.

1027
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:55,441
But the thing about Zeppelin that got me
was that every band is influenced by

1028
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:57,340
every other band,
every band.

1029
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,680
I mean they all,
you're,

1030
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:02,350
you're going back to everybody who your
fans with and this guys,

1031
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:05,950
it's sound like guys because that was
their music and I think as a lot of us

1032
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:10,780
has calming influence influenced,
no one ever got sued for my point though

1033
00:45:10,781 --> 00:45:12,400
is my point.
My point was,

1034
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,820
but there's a certain line that you
cross that they crossed where they were

1035
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:21,100
stealing rifts.
The opening to stairway to heaven.

1036
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:24,820
It's like my God,
it's a silage they'll allege it seems

1037
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:29,570
like the same thing.
Legit allegedly allegedly delivery.

1038
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,190
But it made me less,
it made me like them less.

1039
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,840
I know the music is still amazing,
but it made me like the less that was a,

1040
00:45:37,841 --> 00:45:38,800
that was devastating.

1041
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,780
Yeah.
But they're still,

1042
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:43,530
but I have a bootleg of this and they
have them at like

1043
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,310
the whiskey or something and they have a
song called killing floor that sounds

1044
00:45:49,311 --> 00:45:53,540
like the lemon song.
And then by the time it's out on led

1045
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,250
Zeppelin to,
it's called lemon song.

1046
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,750
And then later they got sued for that by
the guy who wrote killing floor.

1047
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,580
So they,
it's not like they didn't know.

1048
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,170
That's one of those things where it's
just like,

1049
00:46:03,171 --> 00:46:05,050
dude,
you obviously knew that you were calling

1050
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,470
a killing floor is a cover and then you
switched some of the lyrics and then

1051
00:46:09,471 --> 00:46:11,440
called it the lemon song.
That's fun.

1052
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,190
But I don't know if this is,
to me,

1053
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:16,670
this is just me,
is completely uneducated looking at this

1054
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:17,810
shit.
I just know that,

1055
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:18,650
uh,
you know,

1056
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,870
that just is a little suspect.
But just,

1057
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,100
you know,
obviously I'm not a musician,

1058
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:22,980
so I mean,
I don't know.

1059
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,720
Fucking,
I dunno.

1060
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,650
I don't want it to be true.

1061
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,310
I don't want it to be true either.
But that's the same thing as the Cosby

1062
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:28,230
stuff.
Nobody wants,

1063
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:28,890
I mean,
those,

1064
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,200
I was reading this,
Chris Rock Article's really interesting,

1065
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:33,540
Chris rock article where he's talking
about,

1066
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,390
um,
people being offended by everything.

1067
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:37,710
And that's why he doesn't do colleges
anymore cause it just looking to be

1068
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,900
offended at things and they're just too
easy to offend.

1069
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,600
But you know,
he was saying that he just doesn't want

1070
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:45,360
it to be true.
And I think everybody feels like that

1071
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:47,460
except the people that obviously were
raped by him.

1072
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,200
Well,
they would want it not to be true

1073
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:50,420
because then they wouldn't be raped.
Right.

1074
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,031
So,
yeah.

1075
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:52,470
So like all of like,
yeah,

1076
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:53,880
you don't want that to happen to
somebody.

1077
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:56,940
And then also this person that you,
you hold as a comedian,

1078
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,110
you know,
we almost went to see him too.

1079
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,250
We were going to,
we're planning on taking a trip to

1080
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:03,780
Vegas.
I saw him earlier this year.

1081
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,710
Did you?
Yup.

1082
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,410
We're just seeing him.
I saw him out in Pasadena at a theater

1083
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,540
and I met him,
uh,

1084
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:12,120
about a year and a half ago.
It was fucking amazing.

1085
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,740
Really.
It was amazing.

1086
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,270
It was fucking amazing.
I was,

1087
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:17,040
uh,
his set was amazing.

1088
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,601
Yeah.
At everything.

1089
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:18,961
Yeah.
Yeah.

1090
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,460
When he went to go see the guy,
me talking about guy,

1091
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:22,530
you know,
77 years,

1092
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:24,000
76,
77 years old,

1093
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:26,790
was excited about his new special and
was like,

1094
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,260
why am I tell you I shot this Dang.

1095
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,680
And then she was animated,
so fucking excited about his new special

1096
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:36,610
and was just like to see a guy that far
into it still that excited about

1097
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:37,211
standup.
Like,

1098
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:39,430
dude,
like that gave me a charge for like

1099
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,290
weeks and uh,
you know,

1100
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,550
so like I said,
I hope it's not true.

1101
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,070
Yeah.
I really hope it's not true for the

1102
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,800
victims more so than it,
but you're just focusing on him though.

1103
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,890
But if you're doing that,
then the victims are crazy lunches,

1104
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,840
alleged victim.
Well,

1105
00:47:51,841 --> 00:47:52,674
I mean,
and then you know,

1106
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,610
that's better to be a crazy person to be
a crazy liar than to be a rape victim.

1107
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,420
They were to being raped by bill Cosby.

1108
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,880
This new one is interesting because the
girl said it says she was 15 and he,

1109
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,450
he took her to the playboy mansion and
allegedly,

1110
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:12,440
but when you go to the playboy mansion,
they have your name on records.

1111
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:16,520
Like every person that goes there has to
put their name down in all their

1112
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:17,460
information down.
It's,

1113
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,140
there might be actual proof that she was
15 and he took her to the playboy

1114
00:48:21,141 --> 00:48:21,940
mansion

1115
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,800
sound like one of those bad news
programs.

1116
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,210
So there might be,
we might have some information later on

1117
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,180
so hang around for that.
But like not the little in the point

1118
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,540
where,
but that's just his fucking brutal.

1119
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:32,920
It's crazy though.

1120
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,790
This all happened out of Hannibal
Burress his joke like him talking about

1121
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:37,510
it on stage.

1122
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,090
No,
somebody filming the person who put it

1123
00:48:39,091 --> 00:48:41,730
up should be getting credit cause Ha
Hannibal didn't do that and he shouldn't

1124
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:44,340
be getting the grief either.
It was a fucking great joke is a funny

1125
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:45,840
joke.
It's a joke.

1126
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:50,380
Then it became funny bit possible fact.
Um,

1127
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,440
I actually felt bad for him because I
don't think he wanted that.

1128
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:54,300
I think he just,
I think it was just telling a joke.

1129
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,130
They do it if some of this shit,
you know,

1130
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,210
that's all of that shit is taken out of
car,

1131
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,050
like re everything.
Like these fucking people who take your

1132
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:03,660
shit.
They do the same thing that a news,

1133
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,820
like a um,
a bias news channel or like a political

1134
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,660
ad we'll do.
Like I did this rant making fun of cubs

1135
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:16,080
fans versus White Sox fans.
And the reason why I did it was because

1136
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:19,890
recently Chicago had beaten the Boston
team and all I wanted to do was cause

1137
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:20,724
infighting.

1138
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,830
Okay.
I didn't believe a fucking word of it.

1139
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,630
And I,
and I went on this whole thing and then

1140
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:27,360
I paused and in the end I said,
I'm just fucking with you guys.

1141
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:31,170
I'm just mad because blah blah blah.
They lopped that part off and now it's

1142
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:36,171
just a standalone piece that I'm
shitting all over cubs fans and I'm

1143
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:39,030
defending white sox fans.
And then what was funny was I took a

1144
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:40,510
wild guess and I actually,
people are like,

1145
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,240
dude,
this is like fucking dead on.

1146
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,300
This is exactly the way it is.
It's like I didn't know that but,

1147
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:48,060
but the,
the point of it is is that they went up

1148
00:49:48,061 --> 00:49:51,540
there and they deliberately lopped off
the thing where I say it's just a joke.

1149
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,320
So,
so there's that and I got a specialist

1150
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:02,330
Friday man,
we really tried to fucking be interested

1151
00:50:02,941 --> 00:50:04,650
in that dumb story for the whole time.
You just,

1152
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:08,910
all you had now we just went
to story bill.

1153
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,470
I don't know where to go with that man.

1154
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,650
No,
I'm thinking about this culture of

1155
00:50:12,651 --> 00:50:15,340
trying to catch people doing things like
that and I,

1156
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,670
you know,
and get upset at them,

1157
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,050
especially when it's clearly a joke and
I had a whole bit and in my act about

1158
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:24,160
the difference between jokes that you
say on stage and like being in court and

1159
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,130
getting fucking affidavit.
I have a whole bit in my last

1160
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,480
special about lying.
I'm like,

1161
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:32,450
I lie on stage all the time.
Like if you watch any of my act and you

1162
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:33,170
go,
I don't,

1163
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,670
I'm the,
I don't see things the way this guy,

1164
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:36,380
I don't either.
I don't see these things in the way.

1165
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,120
I see.
I'm talking about that around.

1166
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,130
Yeah.
I'll say shit that I don't believe in.

1167
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:43,640
If it's funny and that's,
I think part of what Chris Rock was

1168
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,560
saying is that people are getting
offended.

1169
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,140
Comics comics should apologize and less,
they actually meant it in a malicious

1170
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:52,610
way that the person took it.
Like if you,

1171
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:54,170
you know,
he can go on stage in a bad mood and you

1172
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:58,220
can deliberately get an,
someone can heckle you or do something

1173
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,710
and then you get mad and you
deliberately try to fucking piss him off

1174
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,710
and uh,
you know,

1175
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:07,430
you might owe somebody an apology then,
but you don't have to go on TV and

1176
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,990
fucking apologize to the country.

1177
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,850
People are doing it because they're
scared.

1178
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,970
They don't want to lose the careers.
Then they also,

1179
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,290
the people have demanded an apology.
You would have

1180
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,550
in kind of say whatever you want.
That's not true.

1181
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,200
You know,
you have a career,

1182
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,600
so talking shit,
I understand that.

1183
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,220
But the thing is,
as of yet,

1184
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:30,920
I do not have a TV show.
Why don't you have to teach better off

1185
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,280
without it.
That's when better off without the fuck

1186
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,260
you doing to this animated show that I'm
doing comes out to you.

1187
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,460
Wait,
you wait,

1188
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,230
but you're doing great.
Stand up though.

1189
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,483
Yeah,
I know.

1190
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,690
I'm not saying,
I'm just saying,

1191
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:49,580
but the animated thing was the perfect
way to go into the TV because you can

1192
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:50,450
get away with anything.
Yeah.

1193
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:52,490
Cause you can't,
you're not going to offend anybody with

1194
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,190
these animated people.
Like what,

1195
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:57,890
what message is this going to send to
animated children?

1196
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,580
You know what I mean?
What about all the three fingered

1197
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:04,820
fucking yellow headed people out there?
Are they going to,

1198
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,030
what are they going to think that it
just piss off Asians.

1199
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,071
Nobody got hurt.
No,

1200
00:52:09,071 --> 00:52:12,410
no headed.
As long as I like square heads thinking

1201
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,760
Simpsons,
uh,

1202
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,670
someone we'll lop would cut it off there
and just be like,

1203
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,550
yeah,
what are you gonna do you,

1204
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,730
you're always,
when you ever saying anything on stage

1205
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,980
that's controversial,
you're always going to open yourself up

1206
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:27,680
to opportunistic people that just want
click bait.

1207
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,500
There's no such thing as controversy in,
in standup comedy.

1208
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,820
There's no such thing.
It is.

1209
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,510
It is manufactured controversy.
It's all complete horseshit.

1210
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,990
It's one person in the crowd.
The amount of times that they've showed

1211
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,450
clips of comics who said something
controversial.

1212
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,930
You literally hear the crowd laughing on
the fucking tape.

1213
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,070
Everybody's laughing.

1214
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,370
Taking it as a joke and one fucking
person and then you know,

1215
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,110
and then you just take it out of
context,

1216
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:53,750
which is out of the comedy club.
I mean,

1217
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:56,120
I'm trying to think of a joke.
Any of my jokes that I could do on the

1218
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:58,700
news that wouldn't seem like,
you know,

1219
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:01,670
I'm doing this bit about Isis and how
they're not a threat and I'd like to see

1220
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:05,000
him try to invade Florida where
silencers are legal and see how far they

1221
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:07,730
fucking get now.
That's silly and ridiculous and funny.

1222
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,490
And a comedy club.
You then put that on Fox News.

1223
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,340
Bill Burns says isis is not real.

1224
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Well what about the soldiers died?
We return the controversial tape we'll

1225
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:26,340
be playing.
What about the soldiers that died?

1226
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:31,530
We are here from Florida that actually
confronted Isis.

1227
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:34,320
When we return,
he listens to what bill said.

1228
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,510
And then after that show and Nancy
Grace,

1229
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:39,210
we'll pick it up on the next hour.
Bill Baer,

1230
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:44,450
the standup Comedienne.
You might have seen him on such shows as

1231
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,600
breaking bad bad.
I'm going to go out on a limb and say

1232
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,310
she's a hot shit.
If you went out and drag with the,

1233
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,820
do you think so?
She would just laugh Vic.

1234
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:52,950
Yeah.
It's a fucking shell.

1235
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,330
Do you think she's just being,
well,

1236
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,130
she was a print.
How much do you know how much my face

1237
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:58,320
hurts to pretend to be that mad?
Every episode.

1238
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,040
I love coming out here and smoking a
little weed and fucking get in a

1239
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,120
relaxed.
My eyebrows.

1240
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,230
I eat Twinkies.
I'll really,

1241
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,190
I get foot massages.
No,

1242
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:10,020
I think she would be fun as hell to hang
out with.

1243
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,260
Andy actually get into an argument with,
it's just a,

1244
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:18,290
she makes unfortunate faces on TV.
I think she's probably exactly like she

1245
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:21,120
comes off on TV.
I bet that's her.

1246
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:22,870
Uh,
Nah.

1247
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,810
You can tell you right now.
You,

1248
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,710
me and Nancy Grace driving to Vegas.
We wouldn't be laughing our fucking

1249
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:30,930
asses off you and I would be laughing
our asses off,

1250
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:35,190
but it'll probably get ugly with her.
I would buy the inland empire.

1251
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,350
She would loosen up.
He thinks,

1252
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,030
yeah,
we'd shut off our cell phones.

1253
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,770
You're not being recorded.
Just fucking,

1254
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:46,010
I was held hostage by profanity farts
out

1255
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,760
show she did,
but she'd have a good time over.

1256
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,080
They irritate me for four hours now.
This is what you do,

1257
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:57,030
right Nancy,
what fucking guests?

1258
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,760
What's the worst guests you ever had
that you just wanted to reach through

1259
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:02,230
the screen and punched him in the face
and then she'd be telling a funny story

1260
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:03,064
and then maybe,
and

1261
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:05,950
that's it.
We'd be in,

1262
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,760
you'd ask her about the Duke Duke
Lacrosse case,

1263
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:12,270
whether it was she was unfairly accusing
them of something they didn't do.

1264
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,460
I don't watch it on TV.
I don't watch the show,

1265
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:16,200
but we are,
it's funny about her as she looks like

1266
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:20,640
Ozzy Osborne in like 1985 during the
ultimate center.

1267
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,640
Like when she wears the black eyeliner
sometimes I literally

1268
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,000
a better looking Ozzie.
Of course.

1269
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,830
Well,
I'm more dainty.

1270
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,510
Ozzie.
Less Feminine.

1271
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,970
More Bruce Jenner.
Ask less hard road.

1272
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,043
Yes.

1273
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,640
America in trouble.
The youth of today to day.

1274
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:42,660
Yeah.
You know,

1275
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,810
I saw something,
I don't know why this reminded me of,

1276
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,890
Oh,
I think shaving down your Adam's apple

1277
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,611
was,
I was thinking of,

1278
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,350
I actually,
uh,

1279
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,290
I don't know.
Sometime I started talking about torture

1280
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:53,280
or some shit on my,
one of my podcasts and someone was

1281
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:54,360
showing them the devices,
you know,

1282
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:56,180
the rack,
the rack would,

1283
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:56,971
they would,
they put him on,

1284
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:58,620
they tie your legs and they would crank
it.

1285
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,330
Okay.
And these guys did an experiment.

1286
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:04,200
Was what gave way,
was that your tendons or whatever?

1287
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:06,180
You know what it was?
They actually discovered it was the

1288
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:08,100
bone.
Oh God.

1289
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,580
Fucking broke or pulled away.
They they put like,

1290
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,160
it was the creepiest thing ever where
they were just like,

1291
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:17,460
this is a pig's ankle,
which is the closest to a human's ankle.

1292
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,050
At which point you're sitting in home
gone.

1293
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,840
Okay.
Like if they said it was a Yak,

1294
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:23,800
like I would argue,
I have no idea.

1295
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,260
So they put this thing on there and they
start,

1296
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:30,040
they tied this little hook with part of
it's neat St.

1297
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:32,620
It was just as much like the knee.
You got to see this thing and they start

1298
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:37,000
cranking this thing and you're hearing
it every time it gave way.

1299
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:39,970
You're heard a noise.
They would do an x ray and you know

1300
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:42,430
these fucking scientists are so,
oh this is interesting.

1301
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,190
This is interesting.
The patella is still there and the

1302
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,950
issue,
see the middle car,

1303
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,760
we'll fucking whatever the hell
ligament,

1304
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,330
but what we're seeing is we're seeing is
stress in Nashville Femur,

1305
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,730
which would be a femur and they fucking
kept doing it.

1306
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:57,640
And what?
What gave way it was,

1307
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:02,590
I guess I was the slowness of it that
made the bone break and not the fucking

1308
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:04,930
tendons where if you just get hit quick
or something like that.

1309
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:05,980
The tenants I,
you know,

1310
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:07,780
I'm so fucking stupid.
I can't remember what they came

1311
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:10,180
conclusion with,
but it actually broke your fucking

1312
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:14,080
bounds.
It's amazing what inventions people came

1313
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:18,610
up with just to fuck you up,
more like to make you more in pain while

1314
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:22,030
there were killing you.
The two things that I've ever seen,

1315
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,340
there's very few actually.
Maybe cats,

1316
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,320
monkeys and human beings are the most
cats.

1317
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:33,350
A mold breaking my bones,
the most sadistic like cats,

1318
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:36,940
the way they catch a mouse and then fuck
fucking let the thing get away and then

1319
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,860
get it again and give it hope and take
it away.

1320
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,260
But you'd get the death penalty.
That's like somebody begging for their

1321
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:42,041
fucking life.
Right?

1322
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,290
Yeah.
I saw this video one time,

1323
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,300
this chimpanzee like you know,
basic.

1324
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:49,780
In the last 10 12 years they've
discovered that chimpanzees like the

1325
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:53,320
occasional steak and want to eat another
monkey because they thought that they

1326
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:54,160
were vegetarians.

1327
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,500
So this fucking monkey trap,
this small,

1328
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:58,480
it's chimpanzee trapped this smaller
one,

1329
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,720
and he's basically standing on the
fucking thing up in a tree.

1330
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,450
And rather than just snapping,
it's fucking neck.

1331
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,370
It's taking its finger and his thumb and
just digging flesh out of its fucking

1332
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:14,260
back and eating it as the monkey is
underneath that just screaming bloody

1333
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:15,880
fucking murder.
And you just sit and I,

1334
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:17,380
I've dude,
I fired a gun.

1335
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,840
I would have blown.
That thing's fucking brains out.

1336
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,500
Just start a principle.
I've seen that.

1337
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,330
I've seen that.
I've seen that video.

1338
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,610
I've seen a bunch of those videos with
chimps.

1339
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:31,120
They,
they liked to eat king hate chimpanzees

1340
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:34,720
should the scary animals,
they are definitely should be respected,

1341
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,720
but they like to eat the organs first.
They eat them while they're alive.

1342
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,240
It's grabbed the,
apparently the Oregons the most

1343
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:41,350
delicious part to them.

1344
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,180
So while they're holding onto the
monkeys,

1345
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:45,400
they're not trying to kill them first.
They're just trying to go right to the

1346
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:49,450
guts and started eating.
Oh Dude,

1347
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:52,150
it's just bending.
But getting back to you get back to the

1348
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:53,320
rack,
like how could you,

1349
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,280
the fucking agony you're putting
somebody through.

1350
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:58,840
I couldn't do that.
I couldn't do that to somebody.

1351
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,810
Don't you think it was?
That was during the time where first of

1352
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:04,840
all people died like way,
way quicker.

1353
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,130
Like people didn't live very long.
They live to be alert.

1354
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,650
If you're lucky,
you got 50 years in holy Shit.

1355
00:59:09,651 --> 00:59:13,150
Like I lived to be 50 whilst the infant
mortality rate was really high.

1356
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,880
There were constantly at war,
war was at close range.

1357
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:20,600
So war involved like swords and arrows
and he thinks about shots.

1358
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,380
The kind of fuck catalog does fucking
flaming bodies.

1359
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,840
You know,
they used to literally light bodies on

1360
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:31,841
fire because human fat is like a good
way of a lighting building's on fire

1361
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,850
because it's so disgusting.
So when they would light us on fire,

1362
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:38,250
they like human bodies on fire launch
them and catapults roofs.

1363
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,650
Hilum first.
Yeah,

1364
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,480
probably.
Maybe,

1365
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,210
I don't know.
Whatever they wanted to do.

1366
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,380
I can't Greenway to a tech center
lecture people.

1367
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,350
Well,
when people get to that night you were

1368
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:51,891
saying,
where are they?

1369
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:55,370
Just going to use all the fucking fuel
to figure out a way to just have no

1370
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:58,300
waste.
We use the waste and it becomes feel,

1371
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,980
but that kind of life where you're,
you know,

1372
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:04,940
your subject of violence and brutality
on a regular basis.

1373
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,910
I bet they was that the movies where the
movies,

1374
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:09,860
they only show the wars.
They don't just show it when they're

1375
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:12,800
hanging out playing like a flute.
You know what?

1376
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:16,010
I think there's probably a lot of war
going on pretty much all throughout

1377
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:18,740
human history.
I just feel like you could hide so much

1378
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,720
easier back in the woods.
Yeah.

1379
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,180
He just ran into the woods.
Yeah.

1380
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:24,180
That was the,
here I'm calming.

1381
01:00:24,181 --> 01:00:27,380
Ps,
you hear the floor fucking moving on the

1382
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,170
horses back there.
You have to figure out a way to get away

1383
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:31,010
from the wolves.

1384
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,080
Yeah,
but you want going down to whole foods.

1385
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:34,160
You a hunt,
your own food.

1386
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,570
You were self sufficient.
Right.

1387
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:37,610
But you had to have your bow and Arrow
and all that stuff.

1388
01:00:37,611 --> 01:00:41,390
You'd like to be close to town,
have a fucking blacksmith nearby.

1389
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,550
Like when you're out there in the woods
by herself,

1390
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:45,560
it's probably pretty,
pretty hard scrabble life.

1391
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,350
Absolutely.
But you know something.

1392
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,510
Anything that's going to kill it.
You kill it.

1393
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:52,910
Kill you.
I was thinking shoot at you and kill

1394
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:53,421
you.
Kill it.

1395
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:55,130
You anything that's going to kill you
out there.

1396
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:57,650
It's just,
it's going to be a quick like a dude.

1397
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:59,690
If a mountain line ever fucking ran at
me,

1398
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:02,840
I'd fucking just give him a neck.
Get it over with.

1399
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:05,310
Dude.
I've gotten scratched by a fucking house

1400
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:07,280
cat.
You think I want to fucking fuck with

1401
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:09,110
you.
God Damn.

1402
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:14,111
140 pound cat and proportionate like
they're there.

1403
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,930
As far as like the strongest house cats
or the strongest cats,

1404
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:20,920
it's house cats are with some of the
strongest pound for pound and mountain

1405
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,680
lines like right up there with them.
Stronger even than like some other cats

1406
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,620
that are terrifying to them.
How they fight off bears going into my

1407
01:01:27,621 --> 01:01:30,720
youtube video watching.
They definitely do.

1408
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,260
It was doing all the animals shit.
Now is it an animal plant?

1409
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:36,950
Is that what discovery just went all
cars like they don't fucking do anything

1410
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,330
anymore.
Discovery.

1411
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:40,640
Yeah.
Animals anymore.

1412
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,060
Well there's a lot of shows like TLC
used to be the learning channel.

1413
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,620
What do they do now?
Reality.

1414
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,290
That's all reality.
It's I say history.

1415
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,230
That's Tlc is honey booboo you don't
have with a history channel is they just

1416
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,920
ran out of war footage.
They just raved.

1417
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:54,920
Just got,
we got nothing.

1418
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:58,310
And then they had to show like nothing
is interesting to anybody anymore unless

1419
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:58,880
there's footage.

1420
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,510
Like I hate it when they would do like
even like some of the civil war shit,

1421
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:05,120
they would have to reenact it because
before remember when we were kids they

1422
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:08,510
would just have drawings of it and they
would sort of pan the camera across

1423
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:13,160
summit and which would put you to sleep.
And then World War II was the shit cause

1424
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:15,440
they would just show him planes getting
shot down and all of that.

1425
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:16,274
You know,
it was like a movie.

1426
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,380
Well they had history channel had like a
lot of Nazi shows.

1427
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:22,230
They had a bunch of those.
And then I think after a while they just

1428
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:26,730
realize is more money in idiots.
This is more money and just reality TV.

1429
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:29,100
It's just safe to a certain point in
time that you come in network.

1430
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,810
Well,
I mean what I think happened was a bunch

1431
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:34,020
of people will watch your reality and
Martin watching their shows and the rise

1432
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:35,310
at the third hour,
right?

1433
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,890
What happened in the night of the long
knives or whatever the fuck.

1434
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:40,320
Then just no one cared anymore and
they're just like,

1435
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:42,330
all right,
if that's what you want,

1436
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,680
they have shit on like ancient aliens.
Like they have a,

1437
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,450
I mean they have how many episodes of
ancient aliens have they done?

1438
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:53,160
I totally believe in aliens,
but I don't think anybody has figured

1439
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:56,610
out a way to travel from planet to
planet and actually live.

1440
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:01,450
I think it's possible,
but I think that way too invested in it

1441
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:04,560
being originally we could figure it out,
but we're going to destroy each other

1442
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:07,980
first and I think everything kind of,
you destroy yourselves.

1443
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,460
That's gods.
I think fucking checks and balances.

1444
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,330
I made this thing smart enough to figure
out how to get over to this other pot of

1445
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:18,720
people that I made,
but they got jealousy and envy and I

1446
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:22,800
want credit and I want to produce your
credit on your fucking rocket ship and

1447
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:27,450
all that shit and like they're all going
to destroy each other first.

1448
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,860
Like we'll destroy it before we figure
even know how to get to fucking Mars on

1449
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:32,970
it by a spell.
Where are you going to do,

1450
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,781
first of all,
how do you,

1451
01:03:33,781 --> 01:03:35,650
how do you,
how do you have enough air to get their

1452
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,220
air?
Like in the oxygen?

1453
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:41,220
Something that generates oxygen.
You'd have to have something to

1454
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:43,740
processes.
Carbon dioxide generates oxygen.

1455
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,200
There's a harder thing would be you
could,

1456
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:49,530
you could probably do that a last,
so I guess the question is,

1457
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,610
well,
plants do that,

1458
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:51,720
right?
Is that what plants too?

1459
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,470
But that's going to last all the way to
Mars.

1460
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,090
Six months.
It's got to last six months and I

1461
01:03:59,091 --> 01:04:00,660
remember,
I don't think it takes six months to get

1462
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:02,040
to Mars things.
Lots of sand.

1463
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,690
I think they're saying it takes six
months.

1464
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,663
No,
it doesn't.

1465
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:11,010
I mean,
think about how far the moon is the

1466
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,280
moon.
He just seven days,

1467
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,320
you know,
all this shit.

1468
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,810
No,
it takes six months to get the marks.

1469
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:18,030
How long do you think it will take?
Fucking years?

1470
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,530
No,
I'm pretty sure it's six months.

1471
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,030
Let's see.
Uh,

1472
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:24,030
how many months to get to Mars?
He's got a creepy tone right now.

1473
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,830
I'm pretty sure it's six months.
I could be wrong

1474
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,640
too.
I was very self deprecating.

1475
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,470
It's possible,
um,

1476
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,870
precise.
Six to eight months.

1477
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,180
I think as far as an earth orbits are
perfectly circular.

1478
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,330
But that's like just a drone though to
actually get a personal note for this is

1479
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,230
a,
for a person,

1480
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,560
this is for a person,
they're talking about the a man space

1481
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:49,860
travel to Mars mission where they're
actually going to have to stay there,

1482
01:04:49,861 --> 01:04:51,960
which is really fucked up.
These people are gonna.

1483
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,490
It's gonna take,
uh,

1484
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:57,360
about six months to get there to do you
realize the fucking balls

1485
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,670
that takes unbelievable.
I'm going to another fucking planet

1486
01:05:02,671 --> 01:05:05,940
forever.
And once you break the Earth's

1487
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:10,470
gravitational pull,
what is stopping you from missing Mars

1488
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,930
when that fucker comes around?
Talk to relations.

1489
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,420
I know that,
but I'm saying if those things are off.

1490
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:16,920
Yeah,
they never are though.

1491
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:17,831
Jerry.
Speed up.

1492
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:22,831
Speed up
towards fucking,

1493
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:25,810
what's the next one?
Saturn.

1494
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,070
Jupiter.
They're pretty good at figuring out

1495
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,503
earth.
Mars,

1496
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,040
Jupiter,
Saturn,

1497
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,510
Neptune,
Uranus,

1498
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:41,230
Pluto loop completed anymore.
They're bringing it back though,

1499
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:42,130
right?
No.

1500
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:44,650
Where'd you hear that?
I heard recently that they were

1501
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:46,930
considering bringing it back as a
planet.

1502
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,690
Did you hear that or read that on a
website?

1503
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,480
This is how they should promote that.
They should have like when they bring

1504
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,370
Pluto back,
they should have the scientists dressed

1505
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,030
in like bell bottoms and shit with like
the,

1506
01:05:56,031 --> 01:05:59,380
the fucking Travolta thank you know like
they bring it back like disco

1507
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:00,214
assumption.

1508
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,560
No,
bringing it back.

1509
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,330
Bringing it back.
Come on man.

1510
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:09,220
I was dressed up like saludo.
No,

1511
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:11,170
that's too on the fucking note too on
the nose.

1512
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:12,150
You know what?
You know what I hate?

1513
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,510
You know what I hate in a on a joke
writer room is they got a hat on a hat,

1514
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,990
a hat on a hat.
When you have like a joke within a joke,

1515
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,150
right?
Like it's like say say whatever the joke

1516
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:25,720
is you fall off the fucking chair and
then you want to add another layer to

1517
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:26,260
it.
They go that's,

1518
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:30,280
that's a hat on a hat and it's just like
so what if it's still but they don't

1519
01:06:30,281 --> 01:06:32,980
understand like taglines.
If it's still funny.

1520
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:36,280
It's funny.
Still is funny but if it's not funny

1521
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:37,220
it's not funny.
No.

1522
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,940
It's like if you had a half that's fine.
How come I can't look at the other

1523
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:42,250
fucking hat the next time I watch it
cause I didn't even notice it.

1524
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,830
If you have a hat on a hat and the hat
is funny,

1525
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,450
it's funny.
That's what I think.

1526
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:49,030
Yeah.
I think like they're acting like funny

1527
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:52,720
plus funny equals not funny.
I think that does that.

1528
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,120
How does that work?
I think that's just a lack of,

1529
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:59,080
it's just the different mentality that a
comic has versus,

1530
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,180
there's definitely like a place you can
go where it's not funny anymore or we've

1531
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:05,170
had a too many jokes or you ruined the
original joke.

1532
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:10,900
But I think a writers have a different
perspective and granted they write for a

1533
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:14,140
living and I don't,
I just think their perspective is a

1534
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:17,200
scene as opposed to your perspective,
which is like stand up,

1535
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,700
you know,
looking at it standup wise.

1536
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,270
No,
I'm not looking at it like this is going

1537
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:22,720
to,
yeah,

1538
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,580
I just think it's fucking funny.
I think as many layers as you can add to

1539
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:29,170
it,
it just keeps getting funnier.

1540
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,600
And then if people don't even get it,
that's fucking funny.

1541
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:36,670
Like why would you even,
why would you fucking sit there and make

1542
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:38,020
that damn rural?
I mean,

1543
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:38,590
I guess,
you know,

1544
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:41,500
I'm going against all of these
successful shows,

1545
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:44,530
so whatever.
I just think there's a different style

1546
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:46,510
of writing too.
Don't you think there's a different

1547
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:49,240
style to way,
like you write for standup and the way

1548
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:51,550
you write or you would write for a
television show?

1549
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:53,440
It's,
it's just a different kind of writing.

1550
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:55,780
I barely know what I'm talking about
ever.

1551
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:56,810
So,
um,

1552
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:58,840
I just,
maybe I'm just frustrated with pitching

1553
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,840
jokes and then somebody's going to Ed.
That's a hat on a hat.

1554
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,930
Like a hat on hat.
We'll see.

1555
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,170
That's why I'm telling you a guy like
you,

1556
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,370
your best shit is you just being you
without anybody that you have to pitch

1557
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:13,204
it to.

1558
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,840
Cause you know,
you have a very year from now when I

1559
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:20,450
show up with the six episodes of
emphasis for funny,

1560
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,880
I think you're getting up,
you're going to have you heard talking

1561
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:25,460
about a cartoon.
I'm always 100% functioning too little.

1562
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:26,720
My fucking,
she love it.

1563
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,430
Animated,
whatever you call it.

1564
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:32,330
It's
like if you look at like the most

1565
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,570
innovative,
dangerous comedy on TV ever,

1566
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,840
it's out park because they can get away
with those guys.

1567
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,620
They've done the best social commentary
for like 17 years.

1568
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:44,240
They don't get the credit they deserve.
Yeah.

1569
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:46,040
Not even close.
They're animals.

1570
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,930
They're the best.
They're and they're,

1571
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:50,960
they're so innovative.
They're just constantly coming up with

1572
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:54,980
new shit like every week.
Genius is that for their social

1573
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:59,180
commentaries because how simplistic the
animation is that those guys that are

1574
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:02,060
like,
but they can just churn them out but

1575
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:06,170
like how finished and polished it is.

1576
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,220
Yeah.
As a brand new joke coming right out of

1577
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,880
the gate,
the first time they era where they just,

1578
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:15,190
they just fucking nail it.
I think it's different.

1579
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,420
For whatever reason.
I feel like they're going to have to do

1580
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:21,080
it for 30 years and then tell people
that they're leaving before they're

1581
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:24,800
finally going to just acknowledge,
you know,

1582
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:28,100
they're going to get out the fucking
Mark Twain Award and all that stupid

1583
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:29,510
shit that you supposed to get.
Well,

1584
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:31,880
they get acknowledgement just by
everybody in loving them.

1585
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,560
I mean the show is that they have taught
pretty much total autonomy over comedy

1586
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:38,060
central.
They kind of get away with whatever they

1587
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:39,620
want.
I mean they can,

1588
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:43,040
they can pull off shit on their show
that no one could ever pull off on

1589
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,780
another show.
Just don't think people give him enough

1590
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:45,614
credit.
No,

1591
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,880
I'm not going to change that argument
show.

1592
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,560
I'm with you.
I don't think they give him enough

1593
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:52,280
credit either,
but either way it's big.

1594
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,790
They can do so much because it's a
cartoon and the characters never get

1595
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,470
old.
They don't have to worry about their

1596
01:09:57,471 --> 01:10:00,500
character like Jj from good times.
That shit wouldn't have been funny if he

1597
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:03,470
was 80 you know that their stuff is
dynamite.

1598
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,200
We shut the fuck up.
Like what are you talking about?

1599
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,380
No,
Jj from good times.

1600
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,810
We're going to pull that one out of my,
well,

1601
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:13,730
now that you brought up South Park,
I don't think it's going to be that

1602
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:15,660
funny,
but I think it's going to be amusing

1603
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,650
consuming music.
Show your show.

1604
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:19,760
Yes.
What's it based on?

1605
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,310
A childhood stories.
Oh,

1606
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:23,430
your childhood stories?
Yeah.

1607
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,520
Well basically everybody in the writer's
room at that point.

1608
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,710
Oh,
so I just got sick of people groaning

1609
01:10:27,711 --> 01:10:29,660
about my childhood stories,
comedy.

1610
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,081
I was like,
well,

1611
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:32,300
what if I fucking animate them now?
What are you gonna grow?

1612
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:33,134
Net.
Huh?

1613
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,440
Wow.
That animated.

1614
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,330
Yeah.
It's fucking annoying.

1615
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:41,250
Why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?
No,

1616
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,380
it's fucking annoying.
That shouldn't be a t shirt that you

1617
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:47,680
sell.
I watched that,

1618
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:50,930
that story that you told last time you
were on the podcast about the guy next

1619
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:53,660
to you on the airplane.
I am questioning you work on

1620
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:55,790
Indianapolis.
I watch that.

1621
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,180
My paper for the most fun I ever had on
a flight when he said,

1622
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:01,880
I'm going to push this button.
And as we're taxiing down,

1623
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:05,420
um,
taxing over to where we're going to take

1624
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:06,254
off.
And I was,

1625
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,363
I was just,
Ah,

1626
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,570
let's,
let's see what happens.

1627
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:10,850
And he was sitting there reaching for
the pocket thing and I'm just sitting

1628
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:12,770
there like,
let's see,

1629
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,970
let's see what happens.
I had pushed the button.

1630
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,430
So this,
um,

1631
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,430
this animated show that you wrote,
who did you do it with?

1632
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:22,900
Just do it all by yourself?
Or did you bring some money?

1633
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,640
Uh,
Mike Price from the Simpsons.

1634
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,300
Oh,
great.

1635
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,150
Yeah,
it was just a fucking force.

1636
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:32,030
And he put up,
he put together this murderer's row of

1637
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:35,180
uh,
a writing room and um,

1638
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:37,630
and then the produce a production
company is um,

1639
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,020
um,
wild west,

1640
01:11:39,021 --> 01:11:42,290
which is Vince Vaughn's company.
And that's how the whole thing,

1641
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:47,291
like I was just going to make a little
five minute vignettes and put them on my

1642
01:11:47,361 --> 01:11:49,340
website.
And then,

1643
01:11:49,341 --> 01:11:50,151
uh,
I don't know.

1644
01:11:50,151 --> 01:11:50,850
I don't want to happen.
I,

1645
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,490
I I,
Steve Byrne,

1646
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,010
I opened for him or something like that.
We were working together or some shit

1647
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:58,340
and Vince was there,
saw my act wanting to see me,

1648
01:11:58,341 --> 01:11:58,881
uh,
hey,

1649
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:00,950
come in and take a general and I had no
idea,

1650
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,950
no idea is no nothing.
And it was really,

1651
01:12:03,951 --> 01:12:06,260
I just took a general like we like you
if you ever have anything,

1652
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:07,660
you know,
ballpark general meeting.

1653
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,250
Yeah,
general meeting.

1654
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:11,420
Yeah.
And I was just walking out and as I

1655
01:12:11,421 --> 01:12:12,560
walked out I was like,
you know,

1656
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,900
I kind of got this idea for a cartoon
and they wanted to do,

1657
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:19,901
when they wait a minute and sit down and
three fucking years later we are one

1658
01:12:20,121 --> 01:12:21,950
year away from it coming out.
I mean,

1659
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:24,950
it just works slowly,
slowly.

1660
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:25,640
The,
the it,

1661
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,440
what is the heart?
Nobody was,

1662
01:12:27,441 --> 01:12:29,450
didn't want,
nobody wanted the idea and everything

1663
01:12:29,451 --> 01:12:30,830
and the whole thing was dead in the
water.

1664
01:12:30,831 --> 01:12:33,290
And then Vince was the guy who was like,
let's go over to Netflix.

1665
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,610
And even that guy's an ammo man.
He's in there in the fucking pitch

1666
01:12:37,611 --> 01:12:40,350
meeting,
selling this fucking thing.

1667
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,940
And then Netflix was like ridiculously
supportive.

1668
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:44,511
They're like,
you know,

1669
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:45,980
do whatever you want.
Netflix,

1670
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,350
shit further.
Push it further.

1671
01:12:48,351 --> 01:12:50,870
Yeah.
Do you see the ad for a Marco Polo,

1672
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:55,800
Marco Polos,
a new series of the Netflix is doing on

1673
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:59,760
Marco Polo and Gingiss cons,
like this huge fucking epic series that

1674
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:01,800
they're doing.
So they have that orange is the new

1675
01:13:01,801 --> 01:13:04,140
black,
there's doing standup comedy specials,

1676
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:08,280
like they're becoming like a real
legitimate network right before our

1677
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:08,660
eyes.
There'll

1678
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:13,660
be on that because they're international
and they are so ahead of the game that

1679
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,320
all you're going to see is just people
trying to rip off their business model

1680
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,120
is what's going to happen.
Uh,

1681
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,130
you know,
it's the usual thing.

1682
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,510
Like,
what are these guys don't know.

1683
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:25,590
They're not going to fucking blah,
blah,

1684
01:13:25,591 --> 01:13:26,251
blah,
and all of a sudden,

1685
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:26,881
okay,
all right.

1686
01:13:26,881 --> 01:13:27,640
And then,
then,

1687
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,510
then the next thing you know,
you become the person and then

1688
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:31,380
everybody's like,
oh,

1689
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:34,380
that's the way you do it.
Monkey see monkey do.

1690
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:37,860
And then I just think people will try to
rip off what they're going to do.

1691
01:13:37,861 --> 01:13:40,170
But they there at the,
uh,

1692
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,880
you know,
they were on point,

1693
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:44,610
so,
so they're cutting their way through the

1694
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:45,990
jungle,
so there's still going to be out in

1695
01:13:45,991 --> 01:13:48,180
front of everybody.
So I think it's going to be very hard

1696
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:51,210
for a,
I don't know,

1697
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:53,250
maybe the fourth person who tries to rip
it off.

1698
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,980
There might be room for two other people
to try to rip off what they're doing.

1699
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,110
You know what I mean?
And then you have like three,

1700
01:13:58,111 --> 01:13:59,160
like ABC,
NBC,

1701
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:02,730
CBS of International Television.
Well,

1702
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:05,280
what they're doing that's unique is that
they're taking the money and they're

1703
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:08,880
making their own shit.
That's the big thing there.

1704
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,290
There've been doing it for,
I did my comedy special with them in

1705
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:15,610
2005 that was originally on Netflix and
then it got sold to showtime,

1706
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,840
but they were even back then,
I mean that's nine fucking years ago.

1707
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:23,530
They were taking chances and funding
comedy specials and now they're doing

1708
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,940
real originals that Kevin Spacey show
that um,

1709
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,620
how's the cards,
you know they're doing and the horsemen,

1710
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,270
yeah,
it's been killing it.

1711
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,130
And your show,
they're doing a lot of Chelsea Peretti.

1712
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,560
Her standup is on Netflix or a news
show.

1713
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:40,120
Um,
I think,

1714
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:42,790
um,
Chelsea handler doesn't she have like a

1715
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:44,550
whole species?
Yeah,

1716
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,680
she left her talk show as far as I know
on a e e to go do a talk show on

1717
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:55,210
Netflix,
left the network to go to Netflix.

1718
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:56,680
That's like,
that would not shoot.

1719
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,590
I'm Alice speak for her,
but I don't think that moves gets made

1720
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,060
two,
three years ago.

1721
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:03,280
He shows you how quickly it changes.
Yeah.

1722
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,780
It'd be like white men,
but I'm on,

1723
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:08,830
I'm on television.
She's got so much fucking money though.

1724
01:15:08,831 --> 01:15:11,110
She probably doesn't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?

1725
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:12,760
She,
she said make that much money on.

1726
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,530
Yeah,
she's,

1727
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,500
she's got a lot of money,
man.

1728
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,231
She's a very,
well,

1729
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:21,970
she's also,
it's not just that,

1730
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:23,980
it's books.
She saw a lot of books,

1731
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,500
you know,
she's in that stage to where she has

1732
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:31,390
like this giant amount of fans that
could just follow her anywhere she goes

1733
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,310
and I don't know how that works.
I don't get like,

1734
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:35,680
how do you like,
uh,

1735
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,870
how do you have a TV show and write a
fucking book?

1736
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,550
I Dunno.
And do stand up in the constantly.

1737
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:43,570
I mean she does.
She does a lot of shit.

1738
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:46,660
She's just constantly working.
Yeah,

1739
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:49,330
that's,
I mean I'm never going to be that busy.

1740
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,730
I couldn't handle that.
Yeah.

1741
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:55,780
I'm too busy right now.
I think there's a certain level of busy

1742
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:57,790
where you just like,
you can coast,

1743
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,430
you could like keep it,
keep the fire burning at a certain

1744
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,560
temperature,
certain Rpms,

1745
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,270
but it goes up and down when it goes.

1746
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,690
I would think just having a TV show and
trying to keep that thing on the rails

1747
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:10,930
and have just prevent someone from
coming in and fucking it up.

1748
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,320
Would be,
uh,

1749
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,270
would be hard enough.
That's a big thing.

1750
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,700
Preventing someone from coming in and
fucking it up.

1751
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,140
Right.
Cause that's a real issue.

1752
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:22,630
Someone could definitely come in and
fuck it up.

1753
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:23,650
Yeah.
Cause they want credit.

1754
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:24,360
Yeah,
I got it.

1755
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,350
They got,
you have to implement something that I

1756
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:28,360
said again,
that's all negative shit.

1757
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:32,560
I'm going to try to white whitewash all
that.

1758
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,660
No,
not that it hasn't happened to me,

1759
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:35,800
but I just,
I don't want to get a test.

1760
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,860
It's our old fucking conversation that
uh,

1761
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,600
everybody knows it.
That's,

1762
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:41,620
that's what it,
that happens in every fucking business.

1763
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:43,000
You know.
Look at the Geek squad.

1764
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:44,320
That was a great thing.
And then best buy,

1765
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:46,250
it was like,
oh hope dirge or make money without us

1766
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:48,830
and then they fucking absorbed it and
nobody uses this shit anymore.

1767
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,390
Squad before best buy.
It was just a bunch of nerds who would

1768
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:53,410
fucking,
it's like Uber,

1769
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:56,320
they said they would run around fixing
your computers and they dress like

1770
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:58,660
nerds,
like with the black ties and the white

1771
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:00,850
fucking,
and then bought them and then they

1772
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:03,190
bought them.
And I've never seen it.

1773
01:17:03,191 --> 01:17:04,240
It was cool.
They showed up.

1774
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:06,340
It was funny.
They were like embracing being nerds.

1775
01:17:06,341 --> 01:17:09,590
It's like 10 years ago they had the f I
haven't had fucking glasses and they

1776
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:13,520
came over and they just fix your shit
and it kind of had like this spy vibe to

1777
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:15,170
it.
Geek squad and they showed up dressed

1778
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:17,030
like nerds,
but also kind of like a little pulp

1779
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:20,120
fiction ESC except without the jacket
and it was a,

1780
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:23,770
it was fucking cool.
I wasn't aware of them back then then.

1781
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:26,390
Then they drove around in little
beetles.

1782
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,411
Yeah.
Did.

1783
01:17:27,411 --> 01:17:28,490
Were you aware of him?
Oh yeah.

1784
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,950
Before best buy bottom.
Yeah.

1785
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,020
I wasn't using right now my fucking
laptop died.

1786
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,390
What happened?
Do you use a Mac laptop?

1787
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,220
Are you one of those guys that gets
frustrated?

1788
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,560
Honestly,
I got frustrated and I slammed it shut.

1789
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,410
Was it an apple laptop or a windows
laptop?

1790
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,120
Apple.
See,

1791
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,460
I would think of,
you might be one of those guys that

1792
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:46,971
goes,
you know what,

1793
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:48,710
I'm fucking sick.
All this apple shit.

1794
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,880
Everybody uses apple.
I'm going to go windows and I'll see you

1795
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,290
being hot guy.
Now.

1796
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,270
What I do is I just,
uh,

1797
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,230
I keep computers forever and I keep I
iPhones forever.

1798
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,860
I'm always at least two numbers behind
whatever everybody else has.

1799
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,120
Why do you do that?
Because when I say hello,

1800
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:10,730
the person can hear me.
What does that mean?

1801
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,480
It means it means I don't need a new
fucking phone.

1802
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,621
Oh,
okay.

1803
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:17,510
So it's firing.
He takes video.

1804
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,680
I don't even need the gays and kneel at
this Gloria screen.

1805
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,680
Look how beautiful.
Look how big that stupid ass fucking

1806
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:25,850
thing is.
How dare you,

1807
01:18:25,851 --> 01:18:28,160
first of all,
first of all,

1808
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:29,630
how dare you.
Second of all,

1809
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,850
the camera on this thing is fucking
substantially.

1810
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:37,070
You got to see the new camera on the
iPhone six.

1811
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:40,040
That's what I'm saying.
When I point that at my Dick,

1812
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:43,090
dude,
you can see the helmets.

1813
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:43,611
Great.
God Damn.

1814
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:45,440
Picture a picture.
Joey Diaz.

1815
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,740
That's great.
That's great God damn picture.

1816
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:50,160
It's too clear.
It's fantastic.

1817
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:52,220
We clearly look how good that is.
Huge.

1818
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,170
Joey does not look like that in real
life.

1819
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,900
Technology has gone beyond what you've
seen,

1820
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:59,000
but young bill burr,
he does look like that.

1821
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:02,450
He does look like that now I'm just,
you just see you're looking at them in a

1822
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:04,310
little tiny 400 to talk you out of your
phone.

1823
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,700
You obviously love it.
Could you make me feel bad about my

1824
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,160
purchase?
I'm happy for you bill.

1825
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,860
I remember like couple of years ago you
were still using mapquest.

1826
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:15,290
Do you still use mapquest or do you
know?

1827
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:16,940
I used,
I used the one that's on that,

1828
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:18,380
that thing.
But the uh,

1829
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,300
the one that's on your phone.
I mean,

1830
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:23,000
you know what I hate.
I hate like the fucking recycled jokes

1831
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:25,160
on the Internet and people like someone
would be like,

1832
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:28,640
was this film with a potato for like the
9000000th time?

1833
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:31,790
You're going to write that and be like,
can you just pick a different vegetable?

1834
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:34,130
Can you try to elite a little bit
original?

1835
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,750
I do not believe I've ever heard someone
ask you.

1836
01:19:36,751 --> 01:19:39,530
And I know you have home with a potato.
It's fucking,

1837
01:19:39,531 --> 01:19:41,360
it's like this recycled,
wait,

1838
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:45,080
what?
Like those fucking

1839
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:49,900
said no one ever.
It's like he's fucking like,

1840
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,200
it's like mad libs.

1841
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:54,620
That's true.
Said no one ever is pretty common.

1842
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:58,880
But effective if used properly.
Like I reserve the right to you,

1843
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:01,400
said no one ever.
If I'd fucking half too.

1844
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:04,250
If it's right there,
I got to admit I,

1845
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:05,690
I would,
I would definitely,

1846
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,770
you'd a few notches I would drop off.
Seen watches in your estimation up

1847
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:13,280
front.
I'm looking at drop a few matches the

1848
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:16,170
stratosphere that I have.
You went right to build myself back up.

1849
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:18,550
I have to fail a little.
Nah,

1850
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,640
once you drop a certain point,
you dead to me.

1851
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:26,520
I'll take that into consideration.
But wait what Wayne said,

1852
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:31,521
no one ever within two hours.
If I got two of those tweets from you,

1853
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,340
I would uh,
well when people say really stupid shit

1854
01:20:35,341 --> 01:20:37,340
like khaki comedy,
including all the people who now are

1855
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:39,270
going to watch this and then tweet that
to me and they just think it's

1856
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:40,400
absolutely fucking genius.

1857
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,310
Not realized that like 9,000 people had
the exact same idea that water cooler

1858
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:47,670
jokes.
You know those fucking just gay or you

1859
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:49,410
know me.
You know about the Shit that Collin

1860
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,080
Quinn makes fun of those fucking Collin
Quinn.

1861
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,030
Yeah,
that it cause people don't even know

1862
01:20:54,031 --> 01:20:56,430
he's joking.
Like you know like one of the beautiful

1863
01:20:56,431 --> 01:20:59,850
things about knowing Collin and then
knowing his tweets is that some people

1864
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:02,130
were reading his tweets and they might
not get it at all.

1865
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:03,990
They might think,
do you remember the Colin Quinn show he

1866
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:06,210
had on NBC?
He had one of the greatest fucking

1867
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:09,000
sketches and it was like,
it was so much fun.

1868
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:13,650
It was like office humor and I remember
Bobby Kelly's was the funniest one.

1869
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:18,651
It was the high five guy at the office
in Bobby just comes walking by.

1870
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:22,090
He just like,
dude got that new jet ski and he

1871
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,690
fucking,
he just puts his hand up and you have to

1872
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:27,840
high five fucking,
even the way you high five was

1873
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:28,290
hilarious.

1874
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:31,260
Mine was somehow I went up to Greer
Barnes,

1875
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,610
not Greer Barnes.
I went up to Godfrey and and and said

1876
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:38,610
some really white shit to him is Greer
Barnes was standing in delivering a

1877
01:21:38,611 --> 01:21:40,770
package like dude ain't took a
recommendation.

1878
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,410
Something like God's for God's first
park was hilarious.

1879
01:21:43,411 --> 01:21:46,770
Some really stupid white movie.
And then Greer is sitting there looking

1880
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:48,900
at God like he's a fucking sell on or
whatever.

1881
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:53,730
I'm totally butchering this,
but it just totally tapped into like

1882
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:59,070
when you work in those fucking offices,
the amount of like this like six jokes

1883
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:01,230
and they all just keep telling them that
was in,

1884
01:22:01,231 --> 01:22:04,020
I'm not like those are the only jokes,
but there's like six jokes that you can

1885
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:07,680
just always get count on
for a laugh.

1886
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,140
What was that was on NBC,
right?

1887
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,510
For how long?
Many episodes had called show last.

1888
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:14,550
It was sort of the season,
right?

1889
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,050
Only one season.
Like 600%.

1890
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:18,840
And it was like we're liking it.
It was like what tough?

1891
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:20,130
It was just on the wrong network.
It was what,

1892
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:23,820
what tough crowd became.
Cause he also had this thing where uh,

1893
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:28,650
Patrice and Norton and all of them will
be sitting down and just in different

1894
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:31,560
areas it was actually shot really cool.
And uh,

1895
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:33,780
they would just be talking about topics.
We had like a live thing.

1896
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:36,390
He had these sketches thing.
It was a fucking great show.

1897
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:38,460
It's a great show.
He's a funny dude,

1898
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:39,030
man.
I want.

1899
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:41,730
I did tough crowd.
I got to see him warm the crowd up,

1900
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:43,470
you know,
he does stand up before it and I was

1901
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,630
like,
I forgot how fucking funny kind of coin

1902
01:22:45,631 --> 01:22:47,610
this.
He's really fucking funny.

1903
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,490
Really good.
The best was when he first got on

1904
01:22:50,491 --> 01:22:52,710
Twitter.
If you follow them early and nobody knew

1905
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:55,260
what the fuck he was doing.
Are you doing gang signs over there?

1906
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:59,840
I know I was doing three episodes.
Oh it only when he had,

1907
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:03,120
when he first got on Twitter and,
and so many people didn't know what he

1908
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:06,010
was doing.
It was fucking funny.

1909
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,800
They still don't every day,
but he does still don't.

1910
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,260
But he's like Zeplin such an underrated
band.

1911
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:13,620
It's just a shame.
They never had a hit to that.

1912
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:15,020
And people are like,
what the fuck is that?

1913
01:23:15,021 --> 01:23:15,854
All capitals.

1914
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,430
But when you do that you're trolling
like dumb high school kids.

1915
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:25,630
I think a lot of adults were fallen for
that too.

1916
01:23:25,631 --> 01:23:28,210
And uh,
when he would talk about how famous he

1917
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:32,110
is and how,
who the fuck somebody stepped down in

1918
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:32,940
[inaudible]?
I don't know.

1919
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,690
He always,
he's always good for a fucking,

1920
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:39,350
he's a funny fucking comic man.
Watching him do stand up like you really

1921
01:23:39,351 --> 01:23:41,290
get to appreciate it.
I think even live,

1922
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:44,920
he's one of those guys you really want
to see a live like when you see him,

1923
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:47,020
like even in film it's like you're
missing something.

1924
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:50,180
You're missing half of the Canard.
Yeah.

1925
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:51,963
Yeah.
He's amazing.

1926
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:55,300
That show shit never been cancelled.
If they're smart they'd bring back.

1927
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:56,800
Tough crowd.
Tough crowd was off.

1928
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:59,350
Fucking great idea.
It was our great show.

1929
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,180
You're speaking to that.
How weird is it?

1930
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,370
There's two shows that have come back
that is the comeback came back with the

1931
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,670
[inaudible] which was a great show was
just sort of ahead of its time.

1932
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,930
But the weirdest fucking thing I ever
saw was when our cineo show came back.

1933
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:17,230
Dude,
he came back with the same fucking

1934
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:20,890
haircut,
maybe look 10 days older and then had

1935
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:25,390
the same guests and it was just,
and it was like 20 years never went by.

1936
01:24:25,391 --> 01:24:26,830
It was,
it was like a,

1937
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:28,600
it's a long,
one of the few times I ever wished that

1938
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:31,450
I did like hallucinogens cause I was
just like,

1939
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:33,880
this is,
it was blowing my mind.

1940
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:37,070
It blew my fucking mind.
He had,

1941
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:41,470
I think he had like Dyson or Eddie or,
or somebody and it was just like,

1942
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:46,630
I felt like I was like 24 again and I
was just starting out as a comic when I

1943
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:49,090
used to watch it going by,
if I get to do standup on this,

1944
01:24:49,091 --> 01:24:51,100
how am I going to,
how am I going to navigate?

1945
01:24:51,101 --> 01:24:52,780
Am I going to cross over to this crowd?

1946
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:55,040
And
you know,

1947
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,460
I dunno.
It was just bizarre.

1948
01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:02,380
They took over his social media accounts
when they did that show like East

1949
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:02,891
Arsenio.
He's like,

1950
01:25:02,891 --> 01:25:04,180
because he was being too edgy.
No,

1951
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:05,200
no.
That's what they do.

1952
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,120
That's what they do now on a lot of
shows.

1953
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:11,080
They demand to take over your social
media and they start tweeting for you.

1954
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,410
How crazy is that?
That's what he told me.

1955
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:18,340
That signing over power of attorney and
like an uh,

1956
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:22,660
exact cyberspace kind of way.
Exactly like signing their name,

1957
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:24,700
your name,
and he was trying to get his Facebook

1958
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:26,950
back and it's Twitter back.
And I was like,

1959
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:28,750
what?
He was telling me,

1960
01:25:28,751 --> 01:25:30,400
he was telling me this at the ice house
and I was like,

1961
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:31,820
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
They made,

1962
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:33,910
he goes,
I didn't want to initially,

1963
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:34,631
but I said,
you know what?

1964
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:36,790
I'm going to be so busy with the show.
Fuck it.

1965
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:38,280
Let 'em do it.
Now I'm trying to get it back.

1966
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:39,610
I'm like,
oh my God,

1967
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,950
they just take over your account.
Yeah.

1968
01:25:41,951 --> 01:25:43,300
But if you let them,
you just say no.

1969
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,230
Exactly.
No,

1970
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:47,830
but you gotta be willing to say no.
It might be a deal breaker.

1971
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:49,930
And he started Sineal go fuck yourself.

1972
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,100
Yeah,
but came to me.

1973
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:54,850
Yeah.
But they,

1974
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,610
you know,
if they're thinking that people want to,

1975
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:01,900
they want to be ball players,
you know,

1976
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:02,651
hey,
you know,

1977
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:04,070
we're willing to work with you.
Like

1978
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,960
want to make this show it hit.
That's a Sioux thing.

1979
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,960
They don't want to get sued by you
saying something fucking nuts.

1980
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,300
And then Ima,
if you read the guys' interviews,

1981
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,550
aren't seeing it was interviews are
always great because he doesn't give a

1982
01:26:13,551 --> 01:26:16,010
shit.
And he just Kinda says what he's saying.

1983
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:18,200
So they're looking at like,
yes.

1984
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:19,750
Says Wild Shit.
Yeah.

1985
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:20,400
Well,
I mean,

1986
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,710
I,
I know I just,

1987
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:25,550
he's honest,
which does not work when you got to sell

1988
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:28,880
toothpaste and fucking cars and all that
shit in between the comedy.

1989
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:30,440
So I think that that's,
that's fine.

1990
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,160
But having never gotten a show on the
air,

1991
01:26:32,161 --> 01:26:35,360
Joe,
this is what I feel is going on behind

1992
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:36,460
the scenes.
We'll McGuire,

1993
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,030
you know,
Chris Mcguire was the head writer,

1994
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:39,171
uh,
on,

1995
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:41,090
uh,
he was the head writer over there,

1996
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,350
so he,
you know,

1997
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,720
he told me it was a struggle from the
beginning,

1998
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:48,080
but it was also that they were trying to
do the same show.

1999
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:51,410
They're trying to do the exact same show
that they did in the 1990s,

2000
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,100
which is really strange because I was
saying he was a likable guy.

2001
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,080
I mean,
people love them,

2002
01:26:56,081 --> 01:26:58,850
but it seems like if you found the right
vehicle for him,

2003
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:03,080
he'd be a great talk show host people.
He's genuinely friendly,

2004
01:27:03,081 --> 01:27:04,920
likable guy.
Yeah.

2005
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,140
I mean,
like I said,

2006
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:08,690
it was,
it looked like the exact same fucking

2007
01:27:08,691 --> 01:27:11,570
show and I felt like,
did I just like miss that this thing was

2008
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:14,450
still going on and then he had all these
guests from back then.

2009
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:15,610
I think that that,
like,

2010
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:16,810
I think the whole thing could,
uh,

2011
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,090
uh,
I dunno.

2012
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,680
I Dunno.
I just want to just stop when I would

2013
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:24,770
put it on when it first started.
Maybe just did that the first week.

2014
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,260
Uh,
no,

2015
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,250
no.
He kept doing it.

2016
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:29,523
They kept doing it.

2017
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,000
They,
they kind of does what they did.

2018
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,560
I mean,
it might've altered a little bit,

2019
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:38,030
but that was essentially the show.
It's hard to do those fucking shows,

2020
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:39,170
man.
I could never,

2021
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,940
I can have a host to talk shop.
No fucking way.

2022
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,190
You don't get to choose your guests.
You know,

2023
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:46,520
like people equate a podcast to a talk
show sometimes.

2024
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:48,920
But the thing about a podcast is,
you know,

2025
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,650
I,
I like you like I want,

2026
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:54,270
I want her to talk to you today.
I tell you man,

2027
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,970
like you man.
But you know what I'm saying?

2028
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:58,490
Like I don't have to pretend.
It's like if you were some guy that I

2029
01:27:58,491 --> 01:28:01,130
didn't know that was in here that was
pitching something I didn't give a fuck

2030
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:04,250
about,
but the network that my story is a dying

2031
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:06,410
and then you got to save them.
Oh,

2032
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:07,100
those are the worst.

2033
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,140
Right.
And so on.

2034
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:10,390
We'd have to jump in.
Well,

2035
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:10,920
I,
I,

2036
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,680
I feel,
I feel bad for,

2037
01:28:12,681 --> 01:28:13,330
uh,
when,

2038
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:16,420
when I see a talk show host and has a
guest where they're off or they're

2039
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,860
their,
uh,

2040
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:21,080
stories aren't working cause it,
you see him,

2041
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:24,140
you see him like glancing down at the
card and then they got to like

2042
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:28,280
letterman's the best thing they got to,
cause it'll just openly mock the

2043
01:28:28,281 --> 01:28:31,280
situation.
He'll just openly mock you if it goes

2044
01:28:31,281 --> 01:28:32,300
wrong like that.
I'll

2045
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,980
just let you sit in it going,
okay.

2046
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:40,400
Yeah.
Do you remember Bill Hicks bit on Leno?

2047
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,710
Oh,
the Dorito thing?

2048
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:44,780
Yeah.
The whole thing about having joy

2049
01:28:44,781 --> 01:28:48,290
Lawrence on the show and ask,
enjoy Lawrence if he has a girlfriend.

2050
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:49,051
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2051
01:28:49,051 --> 01:28:49,491
yeah,
yeah,

2052
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:50,360
yeah.
You know,

2053
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:51,740
and,
and choices.

2054
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:53,090
No,
well,

2055
01:28:53,091 --> 01:28:54,320
yes,
we'll shoot things.

2056
01:28:54,321 --> 01:28:55,600
So,
right.

2057
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:59,960
He pulls a gun out of his drawer and
fucking blows his brains out and is his

2058
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:04,080
brain splatter on the wall and the form
of an NBC peacock cause he's a company

2059
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:05,850
man to the bitter end.
Jesus.

2060
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:07,140
Dude,
that was word for word.

2061
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,371
No,
I did.

2062
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:09,860
I forgot all the part about him.
Uh,

2063
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:14,050
changing clips.
He's,

2064
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:17,760
he pulls out an Uzi and east suck on a
news and he's spraying bullets through

2065
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:22,761
his head and he'd change his clips and
it's fucking hard gig.

2066
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,700
Leno loves doing that show that he does
now because of that.

2067
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,440
He does that car show online.

2068
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,730
Jay's garage watch.
I go on that all the time.

2069
01:29:33,731 --> 01:29:37,280
I love it.
Great fucking car collection is insane.

2070
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,200
It's insane.
And it's all like,

2071
01:29:39,201 --> 01:29:41,690
he's got great taste in cars.
Then he's got these fucking cars,

2072
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:44,530
like those ones.
We got like two shifters and she's got

2073
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,800
goggles on and stuff.
But,

2074
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,800
um,
he had won a car recently,

2075
01:29:48,801 --> 01:29:49,760
that bank,
I crossed,

2076
01:29:49,761 --> 01:29:51,290
forget it.
I got obsessed with it.

2077
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:53,000
If you want to look it up.
He did.

2078
01:29:53,001 --> 01:29:57,080
It was an early,
a seventies Dotson I think five,

2079
01:29:57,081 --> 01:30:01,610
10 and um,
they're just the coolest fucking cars.

2080
01:30:01,611 --> 01:30:02,151
If,
if you,

2081
01:30:02,151 --> 01:30:04,310
uh,
if you put like a new engine in the

2082
01:30:04,311 --> 01:30:05,720
suspension and everything cause it's
like,

2083
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:08,030
it's like the classic American sustained
sedan,

2084
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:11,060
but the miniature like uh,
Asian version of them.

2085
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,470
And uh,
let's see.

2086
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,740
Can you get a picture of it before I'd
just stammering a fucking complete black

2087
01:30:15,741 --> 01:30:16,580
hole here on this thing.

2088
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:20,960
That's they just fucking bad ass car
man.

2089
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:23,290
Oh.
So they did like a wretch stow,

2090
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:27,320
a resto mod version of an old,
it's an old Datsun.

2091
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,680
It's like a Datsun five 10 or something
like that doing,

2092
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,070
it's got that little fucking,
the her shift or automatic,

2093
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,480
it just looks so much fucking fun to
drive because my brother had a,

2094
01:30:35,481 --> 01:30:38,060
uh,
the smoothest shift in car ever drove.

2095
01:30:38,061 --> 01:30:41,840
He had like an 81 Toyota Tercel.
And when you changing gears in that

2096
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:42,291
fucker,
they,

2097
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:45,770
it just was like butter.
And it was this piece of shit and it

2098
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:47,290
was,
I just couldn't understand that was that

2099
01:30:47,291 --> 01:30:49,970
that was a really bad time for American
cars where they would deliberately

2100
01:30:49,971 --> 01:30:53,510
making them to shit the bed.
It's 60,000 miles so you would get this

2101
01:30:53,511 --> 01:30:56,990
perpetual car payment.
At least that's the conspiracy theory of

2102
01:30:56,991 --> 01:31:01,130
it and all of these fucking uh,
Toyota cars that to remember that when

2103
01:31:01,131 --> 01:31:03,890
they started coming out in this,
but dominant only went up to 80 miles an

2104
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:07,700
hour and everything that you,
the speed and not while the gas crisis

2105
01:31:07,701 --> 01:31:09,830
and all that,
and the Mustang became the Mustang to

2106
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,970
became a car like Farrah Fawcett,
Provan Charlie's angels.

2107
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:17,110
There was a such a hunk of shit.
It went from being one of the most bad

2108
01:31:17,111 --> 01:31:21,740
ass American muscle cars ever to a,
just a total plastic,

2109
01:31:21,741 --> 01:31:23,510
shitty shape,
ugly.

2110
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:26,300
They made an ugly table within like five
to seven years.

2111
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,450
It became just an absolute and all of
that.

2112
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:34,451
There was so many of those held over
like a muscle car names that just became

2113
01:31:34,731 --> 01:31:38,510
like a shell of themselves,
like the Cougar and it become this big

2114
01:31:38,511 --> 01:31:43,511
fat ass fucking tutored like sedan,
like with sort of a poor man's like

2115
01:31:44,271 --> 01:31:47,000
Lincoln continental or something.
Um,

2116
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,910
but whenever he,
but he is his collection of cars.

2117
01:31:49,911 --> 01:31:51,740
It's just fun.
It's fucking incredible.

2118
01:31:51,741 --> 01:31:53,810
And just his knowledge of them.
That's really cool.

2119
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,250
Well,
he's really passionate about it.

2120
01:31:55,251 --> 01:31:58,760
That just shows you when you get a guy
doing something that he actually likes

2121
01:31:58,761 --> 01:32:00,040
to,
like Jay Leno

2122
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,100
loves cars.
It becomes an amazing show when you have

2123
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:05,920
him host the tonight show you like,
he doesn't give a fuck about Joey

2124
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:06,753
Lawrence,
his TV show.

2125
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:07,550
He doesn't.

2126
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,151
Yeah.
So he's got it,

2127
01:32:08,151 --> 01:32:10,040
looked at it like he's,
he's trying to,

2128
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:11,780
uh,
he's,

2129
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,660
you know,
he's making some money and he's going to

2130
01:32:14,661 --> 01:32:17,120
go buy some cars now.
When I was a younger comic,

2131
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:19,670
I used to judge them and belows fuck
bullshit.

2132
01:32:19,671 --> 01:32:20,600
You know,
back when I thought I was,

2133
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:22,220
you know,
I should be wearing a leather jacket on

2134
01:32:22,221 --> 01:32:22,850
stage,
you know,

2135
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:23,930
like I was saying.
And anything think,

2136
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,520
but now that I've gotten older,
I'm like,

2137
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:26,690
Nah,
fuck,

2138
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,300
he's doing his show the way it wants to
do a show and then he wants to go buy

2139
01:32:29,301 --> 01:32:30,134
some cars.

2140
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:31,960
Yeah,
he wanted to make some money.

2141
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:35,650
Made some money.
Apparently does the word is always been

2142
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:39,400
that he doesn't even spend his tonight
show money that he'd spends only a

2143
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:42,340
standup comedy money.
That's where he gets all everything and

2144
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:44,470
then the tonight show money,
I'll just went to the bank.

2145
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:46,710
Can you imagine

2146
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:49,160
dollar collapses,
poor bastard,

2147
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:50,970
get all that money.
Like I don't understand having that all

2148
01:32:50,971 --> 01:32:53,310
in the bank when you're,
your account isn't shared up to like

2149
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:54,660
fucking two,
300 grand.

2150
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,090
Yeah,
it's not smart and then it's also it is

2151
01:32:57,091 --> 01:32:57,924
until it isn't,

2152
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,020
well who knows what all in the bank
means though.

2153
01:33:00,021 --> 01:33:03,260
He might've investments,
he might've put it in bonds and mutuals

2154
01:33:03,261 --> 01:33:03,750
and all that

2155
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:08,190
shit.
You got to convert it into cash,

2156
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:12,640
gold stuff it in your fucking walls and
then just some of it in gold and they

2157
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:16,920
just got to pray.
I haven't all of that fucking money and

2158
01:33:16,921 --> 01:33:20,310
trying to not,
who has that book you read when you were

2159
01:33:20,311 --> 01:33:23,160
in like fifth grade about the guy
catches the big fish and then he's

2160
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:26,670
bringing it into this,
into inland and all those fish are taken

2161
01:33:26,671 --> 01:33:28,950
a bite out of it and by the end he's
just left with the skeleton.

2162
01:33:28,951 --> 01:33:31,260
That's what it's like having a ton of
fucking cash.

2163
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,050
Everybody's just going to fucking
descend on you.

2164
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,810
You know you're accounting bills all of
a sudden,

2165
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:39,750
two plus two equals four is way much
fucking more difficult.

2166
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:43,200
And they got to charge at $9 million
more for your fucking taxes.

2167
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:45,030
Why?
Why?

2168
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,700
Cause I have it.
You know what I mean?

2169
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,200
Yeah.
That's what they do and all of a sudden

2170
01:33:49,201 --> 01:33:50,910
everything becomes a big fucking
problem.

2171
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:55,860
So you just advocate spending it all.
As soon as I advocate getting to a

2172
01:33:55,861 --> 01:34:00,861
certain level of success,
getting a machete in a pit bull and

2173
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:03,380
sitting on your cash.
Yeah,

2174
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,130
but right.
Laid out in the living room.

2175
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,710
You just sit on a mound of it and you
order food,

2176
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:10,680
have it delivered and have it delivered.
You never leave.

2177
01:34:10,681 --> 01:34:13,500
He'll bills off the pile of pay for.
I have no,

2178
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:15,030
uh,
my,

2179
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:16,050
my,
uh,

2180
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,210
whatever in society.
Is Society going to Shit My,

2181
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:25,050
uh,
my plan is I just embraced the fact that

2182
01:34:25,051 --> 01:34:27,360
you can only kill me once.
That's it.

2183
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:28,250
I'm going,
I'm,

2184
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:29,730
I'm,
I'm not going to survive that

2185
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:32,480
you hope.
But what if it's like groundhog day?

2186
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,180
Keep dying like that new Tom Cruise
movie.

2187
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:38,180
The edge of tomorrow we dies over and
over.

2188
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,210
Spoiler alert.
Well then I would just get a gun and

2189
01:34:41,211 --> 01:34:41,750
then

2190
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:44,590
how would just walk around like this and
I wait for the awful death to come and

2191
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,600
then I go like that.
I like how you thought this through over

2192
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,560
may a lot of really good points.
You know,

2193
01:34:51,561 --> 01:34:53,480
I learned it buying it.
Buying an old house.

2194
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,910
Yeah.
Oh,

2195
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,770
you going to be the guy who lays in a
shallow grave and waits for people to

2196
01:34:57,771 --> 01:34:58,070
attack

2197
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,080
you food supply.
Then you sit up like a Zombie.

2198
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,630
Me Know.
I'll be more clever than that.

2199
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:07,430
I'll probably set up a fake civilization
and then be outside of that civilization

2200
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:10,910
and the real civilization like,
so people come in to raid and then

2201
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:12,360
fucking launched down on him.
He's,

2202
01:35:12,361 --> 01:35:16,460
he just words fire what I'm saying.
Listen,

2203
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:17,570
I,
I've planned this out.

2204
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:18,200
No.
If,

2205
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,690
if the shit hits the fan,
I hope the,

2206
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,120
um,
where the fan explodes.

2207
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,960
That's what I think too.
Like if yellow stone blows and we wind

2208
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:31,070
up living in some sort of a perpetual
nuclear winter for the next hundred

2209
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,350
years,
I hope the lava lands on my fucking

2210
01:35:33,351 --> 01:35:33,921
head.
I don't,

2211
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:35,600
I don't want to be one of those
absolutely.

2212
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:40,070
Hardscrabble people out there in
Antarctica trying to eat seals and stay

2213
01:35:40,071 --> 01:35:41,930
alive.
Help reinvent the wheel.

2214
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,460
No,
I don't find that.

2215
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,410
I cause what you're gonna do then what
are you going to do?

2216
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:46,670
Yeah.
That's like

2217
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:50,560
realization went through a divorce right
in there.

2218
01:35:50,561 --> 01:35:53,140
The guy that gets like the flop house,
you know what I mean?

2219
01:35:53,141 --> 01:35:56,410
Like you're just,
you're just going to,

2220
01:35:56,411 --> 01:35:58,630
you're never going to build it back up
in your lifetime.

2221
01:35:58,631 --> 01:36:03,631
So why not leave with a flat screen TV
watching MMA shit,

2222
01:36:04,571 --> 01:36:07,630
whatever you want to fucking watch.
And then the ice still a bit about that.

2223
01:36:07,631 --> 01:36:09,250
Just when that Korean debt,
little fatty,

2224
01:36:09,251 --> 01:36:11,710
they're over in Korea was talking about
how he's going to shoot a fucking

2225
01:36:11,711 --> 01:36:14,680
warhead.
And I was nervous until he said la and I

2226
01:36:14,681 --> 01:36:15,520
was like,
perfect dude,

2227
01:36:15,521 --> 01:36:18,060
right at my fucking giant forehead.
I don't even want,

2228
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:22,030
I don't even want to know.
Just hear that whistling sound like what

2229
01:36:22,031 --> 01:36:23,530
is that?
Somebody watching bugs bunny.

2230
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:26,710
What does that whistling sound?
And then it just fuck it lands right on

2231
01:36:26,711 --> 01:36:27,610
my house and then that's it.

2232
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:30,100
Yeah,
you don't want to be the guy who's

2233
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:34,690
barely survives and has kids and then
dies where your kids are like standing

2234
01:36:34,691 --> 01:36:37,700
over you and they're eight and you know
they can't live on their own.

2235
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:39,040
You're,
you're fucking,

2236
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:43,090
you're dying in front of their eyes.
Like you don't want to be that guy and

2237
01:36:43,091 --> 01:36:45,460
you don't.
You also have to take into consideration

2238
01:36:45,461 --> 01:36:49,600
that even if the human race survives,
eventually it won't,

2239
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:53,290
whether it's a million or a billion
years from now,

2240
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:57,340
eventually the earth will no longer be
able to sustain life because the sun

2241
01:36:57,341 --> 01:36:58,780
will burn out.
So like,

2242
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:00,590
well,
it's not going to last forever.

2243
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:02,780
I'm just talking about like our
lifetime.

2244
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:05,210
If some bullshit happens,
I don't want to go back to them to the

2245
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:09,590
world where like boils and shit and
warts on the end of your nose or an

2246
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:11,960
issue now because there's no more cvs is
and shit,

2247
01:37:11,961 --> 01:37:14,540
whatever the Benadryl,
a crap you'd put on it and then

2248
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:16,520
everybody starts looking like a,
which I like.

2249
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:17,840
They live under a fucking bridge.

2250
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:20,500
Do you know that it's ever gotten a
warrant?

2251
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,750
Other nodes know what I'm saying?
It'll back in the day.

2252
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:26,180
So cvs keeps us from getting warts in
the nose.

2253
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,080
That's another

2254
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,930
did I'll take out of the universe is
gone,

2255
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:33,220
compound w is gone,
dollar collapses and all of that Shit.

2256
01:37:33,221 --> 01:37:35,170
Everything stops being made.
It's done.

2257
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:39,490
They're your best bet is you can fucking
go down to cvs and you rate all those

2258
01:37:39,491 --> 01:37:41,740
drugs.
That's what you do when you take some

2259
01:37:41,741 --> 01:37:43,570
bread and you leave.
Right.

2260
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:45,160
And you just start pouring them in
between sets

2261
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:50,890
and you fucking eat them like a captain
crunch sandwich and all the drugs in

2262
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,730
breakfast club.
Yeah,

2263
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:55,770
I don't think that's a good idea either.
None of them is a good idea.

2264
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,860
Nobody has a good idea.
The only people who are okay,

2265
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:02,520
it would be if you joined blackwater
where they actually have like a

2266
01:38:02,521 --> 01:38:04,740
fortress.
They're the ones who are really ready.

2267
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,110
My favorite ones,
when you watch those doomsday preppers

2268
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,330
and they're basically reading through
their playbook,

2269
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:11,160
that's all.
I had that shallow grave like this guy

2270
01:38:11,161 --> 01:38:12,600
was.
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to

2271
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:16,200
surrender my property and let them
infiltrate it and then I'll fucking come

2272
01:38:16,201 --> 01:38:20,430
around and he's like showing like where
he's going to hide and then I'm going to

2273
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:22,560
be on a spring,
like one of those Murphy beds.

2274
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:27,590
He rises up
the craftmatic craftmatic you bring your

2275
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:30,990
legs engine slow.
You want to be on one of those Murphy

2276
01:38:30,991 --> 01:38:32,920
beds where it pops up.
Oh,

2277
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:34,950
you faking dead.
So they don't see you in the background.

2278
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:36,960
It's just slowly,
slowly coming up.

2279
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,580
He is pointing.

2280
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,080
Well,
you know those beds,

2281
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:43,320
you push them the three stooges bed.
Yeah.

2282
01:38:43,790 --> 01:38:46,780
People get stuck in them and they get
pinned against the wall mart.

2283
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:47,940
They're called Murphy beds.
Right.

2284
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:51,150
You know they used to eat.
That was a popular thing to save space.

2285
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,010
Laverne and Shirley.
Oh,

2286
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:55,070
those things would fucking people get
stabbed him.

2287
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,570
You probably break your fucking,
I bet somebody broke their fucking neck

2288
01:38:57,571 --> 01:38:59,100
and one of those.
I bet.

2289
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,800
I bet people have died the most bizarre
ways.

2290
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,900
Yeah,
I dunno.

2291
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,240
Listen Buddy,
it's almost a quarter to four.

2292
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:07,460
You got to get out of here.
Yeah.

2293
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:09,430
What are you going?
I'm going to Hawaii.

2294
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,560
Why Nolan?
Home Bill.

2295
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:11,970
I'm going to,
I'm going to beat the traffic.

2296
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,410
Where are you going to Indianapolis,
Bill.

2297
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,740
Try to beat the traffic.
Try to eat healthy.

2298
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:19,110
So come down and do your shelter night.
All right,

2299
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:20,970
so bill burr will be at the comedy store
tonight.

2300
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,240
Bill burst special will be on Netflix
this Friday,

2301
01:39:24,241 --> 01:39:26,340
December 5th.
What's it called again?

2302
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,450
I'm sorry.
You feel that way.

2303
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:29,460
The fucking,
the previews look awesome.

2304
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:31,050
And I liked the fact that he did it in
black and white.

2305
01:39:31,051 --> 01:39:33,180
You silly bitch,
you going old school.

2306
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:34,710
Next one you should do with smoke
signals.

2307
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:36,240
It's just no,
no more,

2308
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:37,860
no more film.
I don't,

2309
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:40,260
I don't like HDTV.
Just don't like,

2310
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,080
it's too fucking clear.
You don't need it.

2311
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:45,990
You can do whatever the fuck you want.
It's your already already know how.

2312
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:49,920
I'm going to film the next one too and
you will tell me once this is over

2313
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:53,730
probably uh,
in your own little passive aggressive

2314
01:39:53,731 --> 01:39:56,790
way and with the iPhone six make fun out
to,

2315
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:59,560
those are the latest fucking cameras
that I use.

2316
01:39:59,561 --> 01:40:02,190
By the way,
the iPhone six cameras for the is a

2317
01:40:02,191 --> 01:40:03,330
stylized,
oh,

2318
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:03,840
okay.

2319
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,640
This is not three stooges,
black or white.

2320
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:10,170
And resent the fact that I've been on
this podcast for an hour and 45 minutes

2321
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:11,430
and you would do that to me.
I don't give a fuck.

2322
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:14,220
I'm sure I'll love it.
I'm a fan.

2323
01:40:14,221 --> 01:40:16,050
I'm a bill burr fan.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2324
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:17,570
I don't believe a word of it.

That's right.

2331
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,460
The hilarious bill.
Barley's German.

2332
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:30,690
All right.
Uh,

Go buy it.
I've been watching bill work this

2336
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:42,960
material out.
I saw you at the Ice House recently.

2337
01:40:42,961 --> 01:40:44,220
Fucking hilarious.
Set.

2338
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,540
So funny,

2339
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:46,590
funny,

2340
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:49,380
So that's it folks.
See you soon.

2341
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:49,861
Bye.
Bye.

2342
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:50,694
