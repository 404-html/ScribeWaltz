1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,480
Don't tell him. Call Four, three, two

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,140
Mli Tom, papa, Joe
Rogan and see you buddy.

3
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,740
Good to see you cracking. Lacking I
Nah, not too much cruising around.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,900
We were talking about old
body's falling apart. Yeah.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,010
Got a stem cell shot in my shoulder
that's killing me right now. Yeah,

6
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:24,250
I can tell you're in
pain. Oh yeah. One shot.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,070
Several in both shoulders and this
is not like anything like that.

8
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:32,530
It's like a serious injury,
but there've been annoying me lately,

9
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,970
so I said fuck it.
Let me just go in there.

10
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,220
Every time I've done it it's
made me feel better. Right.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,180
How often do you have to go?
I've been doing it like once
every six months. Right?

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,510
Yeah. That's what happened to it. And then
it kind of is okay for awhile and yeah.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,230
Right. And once every six months seems
to keep me in, but it's expensive.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,123
So is it not,

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,930
is not curing whatever it gets his
healing it being a moron. Right.

16
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,340
And going back to working out hard.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,680
But we were just saying is that soft
tissue heals like this is a soft tissue

18
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:00,460
issue.
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,510
Soft tissue is one of the best things
for things like stem cells to therapy

20
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,590
because you can actually
regenerate tissue. Right.

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,830
And it can heal things where it gets
a real problem with my friend Miriam

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,320
Nakamoto, she brought over
those, uh, snacks, those
bags of snacks or were there,

23
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:17,150
there was a little snack
company. She's a, a,

24
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,420
a multiple time world Moitai
champion Boy Moy, Tai Muay Thai,

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,040
Thai boxing, Muay Thai. No, never
heard of that. Nope. You're so,

26
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,900
if so, uh, what are white? You're white.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,770
You're also like a, a non jock.
Well, I was a jock my whole life.

28
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:39,010
What would you do? I played a
football. Did you? Oh, that's right.

29
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,760
I believe football forever and track
and a bunch of stuff that you fucked.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,180
Then I stopped. Did you fucking
body up at all? Uh, no. Not too bad.

31
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,980
My shoulders a little bit. My shoulder's
a little, but uh, that's pretty much it.

32
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,110
My, my knees, you know,
like I run a lot now.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,090
I've been running off for the
last couple months and uh, what,

34
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,010
what brought that on? I just
want to be in better shape. Yeah,

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,130
I want to feel better. I dropped
like burn off 17 rounds. Yeah,

36
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,490
exactly. I was like, baby, maybe.
Yeah. Your face looks thinner,

37
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:12,670
man. Yeah, it looks good.
Yeah. That's awesome man.

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,820
That's a cool thing once you get
going, right? Yeah. At that momentum,

39
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:16,780
that's what's up. Well, you know,

40
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:21,610
it's really was up was I was kind of
cruising along and just like we lost five

41
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:21,971
pounds.

42
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:26,800
It just kind of like hanging around and
then I realized I'm working out like

43
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,060
this workout that I'm doing is what?

44
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,740
A bit of a warmup when I was an athlete.
Right.

45
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,310
This wasn't even a been a warm up and
I'm like, oh, that was pretty good.

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,211
And I'm just like,

47
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:40,620
I have to stop being a sissy and try
and really push it a little more.

48
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,990
Let's get a trainer, Eh,
I don't like intimacy. Oh,

49
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,470
that's real. Well, you
know what else you can do?

50
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:52,000
There's actually apps where you can
follow an app and the APP will put you

51
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:55,390
through a workout. Oh yeah, yeah. There's
several of them now. They're really good.

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,770
Oh cool.
A bunch of really good ones.

53
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,190
I don't have any affiliation with any
of them. I'm not naming any of them,

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,280
but yeah, you can. Um, you can,
you can even get a yoga one.

55
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,270
You can get a 90 minute yoga one,
right.

56
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,330
Just do yoga and it talks you
through the poses. It's great. Yeah.

57
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,800
I used to do yoga all the time,
but I feel like I've got to, uh,

58
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,180
I feel I have to shift into lifting
weights again because I've just been

59
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,870
dropping now, but I just feel like, you
know, a little bit. I don't want to be,

60
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,820
I don't want her hands. I don't want to
give a guy like at the pool with no arms.

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,501
You know what I mean?

62
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:31,360
So many people have motivated themselves
by going to the beach or the pool with

63
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,920
very little clothes on it. I
thought about Fox summertime. Fuck.

64
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:37,150
People are gonna know.
Yeah, right. Exactly.

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,860
I reveal my secrets and then we're
going to know what disgusts me about,

66
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,630
yeah, this is my glass. Look at
it. This is my laziness. Luck.

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,380
This is what I did all winter. This is
my poor food choices right here. Luck.

68
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,810
This is drinking upper the upper part.
Yeah. This is the part right on the sides.

69
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,170
But I really just, but then when I
started getting after and being like,

70
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:03,610
don't be such a sissy, like trip workout,
try and push it. Then you want it.

71
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,580
Then I want it to do it more.
Then I got into it. Then I'm like,

72
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:11,140
all right let's go. Now I'm going
further and quicker. But uh,

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,840
this is all been cardio.
All Cardio.

74
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,730
What about just body
weight stuff like you know,

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,130
I mean it's not a bad idea to
start off with body weight.

76
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,940
First of all pushups because you
haven't really done much like that.

77
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,370
And while it's Chin ups,

78
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:27,640
push ups and the body weight
squats really don't need much else.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,000
He really not really, I've been
doing more pushups, density,

80
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,250
ferocious workout in with
Change Grip pushups, Chin ups,

81
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,830
body weight squats.
Just to just those things.

82
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,570
Does that mean I have to get
with one of those Chin up bars?

83
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,230
It goes in the doorway that get a real
one though. Cause those things fall on.

84
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:47,290
People don't know. Ones that
hang, folks. Listen to me.

85
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,450
Those ones that hang on the door, the
door Jamb, I used to work construction.

86
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,900
Those fucking things are not
designed for you hanging on him.

87
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,890
Now I have a little tiny nails and people
like me probably installed them and

88
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,300
sometimes you don't hit a stud.

89
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,980
That little tiny nail is going right
into the fucking dry wall and you're

90
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:08,940
hanging that thing over there and
it's pulling on that soccer. No.

91
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,030
Then I'll messed my shoulder up.

92
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,150
I'll beat that fucker's that
drill into the side of the door.

93
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,570
You know what I'm saying?
The ones that they go right in the side,

94
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,750
four screws on each side, that'll
hold your weight. All right.

95
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,730
I don't hold your weight. I'll get that.
That want to work because it's pulling.

96
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:27,360
You're pulling down on the
wood. We, those things are,

97
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,780
it's like sitting on the wood,

98
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,460
you know those ones that it
is a recipe for a broken neck.

99
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,240
I feel like that thing was in like
every eighties movie. Yeah. I mean,

100
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm sure they have good ones to do
that. I'm sure that, yeah, sure.

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,990
But you should really check
out your fucking moldings.

102
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:47,580
First moldings a pull and I just lay on
the ground and do some pushups. Yeah,

103
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,610
but real chin up bar man.
A real chin up bar is, is,

104
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,820
I mean if you just got one in a park, just
go to the fucking park. You're outside.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,520
They'll a lot of parks have like those
bars a little set up so you could do

106
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,400
counseling. Yeah. Nobody
ever, I'm are no joke.

107
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,010
Those are great for working out and I
know they seem too simple. They seem like,

108
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,540
oh ladies with Wesco or for their role, I
go to Nautilus. I don't need this. Right,

109
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,480
exactly.
I do my leg extensions on Nautilus.

110
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,550
I got my membership I use once a month.

111
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,010
Bodyweight squats seem easy
when you do three. Yeah,

112
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,930
but when you do a hundred they
become very fucking hard. Right.

113
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:27,620
When you get to like 70 and you're like,
Holy Shit, you feel that burn baby.

114
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,550
And he'd start counting down in tents.

115
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,070
I remember doing pushups
when we were played football
and you would do, you know,

116
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,300
200 who'd be like 200 breaking motto row.
No. Break them out and do it in a row.

117
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,250
They would, we do like 30 and then
split them up and uh, you know,

118
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:48,251
there was a big time workout and now I'm
doing like 25 I'm like I'm good for a

119
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,620
couple of days. It's hard man. It is hard
getting anywhere more than 30 pushups.

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,060
It's like Whoa, shit
starts getting crazy. Yeah.

121
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,750
It was a lot of pushing.
Yeah.

122
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,540
To like your body has to be
conditioned for that and if it's not,

123
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:06,260
it lets you know you're like dirty
arms start shaking.

124
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,240
The funniest part is hockey around 19
though, you get to like 1819 like bro,

125
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm feeling fucking smooth.

126
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,790
It's so funny how whatever number you
have in your head is where you start to

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,390
write.

128
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,500
If you say I'm doing 20 you start
shaking at 18 if you say I'm doing 25 you

129
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:25,040
don't start shaking until 23 you know,
what's a real mental thing? You know,

130
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:29,380
it's really fucking cool than are gone.
Rogue makes this thing that it's a,

131
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,480
it's like a bamboo pole and on the end
of the pole you put a rubber straps like

132
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:40,010
a, you know, those, those, uh, bands
that you, and then from those bands,

133
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:43,670
you Hank kettlebells off
of the bamboo stick. Yes.

134
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,030
So as you're doing this bench was, I
can't push my lift, my right arm up.

135
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,450
It's all rain right now. Otherwise I'll
show you as you're doing this thing,

136
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,980
everything's all wobbly and everything.
Super, super wobbly because first of all,

137
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,610
the kettle bells hanging from
rubber, right. And the, the,

138
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,390
the stick is bamboo thing is super wobbly.
Right?

139
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,440
And as you lift weights with that, it's
really good for your stabilizing muscles.

140
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,890
Hold an earthquake bar, that's earthquake.
Cool. Or there's a version of it.

141
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:14,891
So it's a stabilizing watch the video
online or someone will take us offline.

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,230
Yeah, the earthquake bar. Yeah,
that's exactly what the one I have.

143
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
We have that out there.
I'll show it to you afterwards.

144
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,990
It's really cool because even lightweight,
like if you had to do 70 pounds,

145
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,130
like 35 on each side,
it's awkward for that.

146
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,150
That doesn't look like something
you want to use in your house.

147
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,350
You're going to ruin your floors. Put
rubber on the floor. Rubber on the floor.

148
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,720
Yup. Rubber over your house so
nothing gets ruined. Did you,

149
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:40,640
do you have grandparents who put plastic
over the furniture? Oh yeah. My Nana.

150
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,180
My Nana and Clifton. New Jersey. Yeah,
mine. Mine was in New York. Yeah,

151
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,480
they put fucking plastic over
the furniture. It was a big deal.

152
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,610
You spent a lot of money on that couch.
You're going to,

153
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,940
it's gonna [inaudible] fuse.
When I, a little kid, I'd
sit on that couch over like,

154
00:08:56,941 --> 00:09:01,410
this is terrible. Especially in the
summer with your shorts and your legs.

155
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,440
Just be sweating it man.

156
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,140
They eventually got kinda like
yellowed by the sun and by use faculty.

157
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,650
So it was weird. Yeah. It was like, oh,

158
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,760
you would like put like a jacket down
and then he would sit on your jacket.

159
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,390
That whole generation never had comfort.
Like their beds were hard.

160
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,220
The pillows were Shit live through
the fucking depression, Matt.

161
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,780
Yeah, that's real. That
shit. People Starve to death.

162
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,970
This was a barbaric time where where
people were brought down to, you know,

163
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,620
base humanity just rival
rough and then you have like,

164
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:42,450
you have like 15 good years and then go
into World War II and they dealt with

165
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,570
that. So yeah, they were
like, we don't need comfort.

166
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,750
We're not laying around in our
sweatpants on bean bag chairs.

167
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,530
Well they knew the importance of being
vigilant. Right. Like we all do. You,

168
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,950
do you ever, do you follow? I'm
David Goggins online. David,

169
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,843
do you know what he is?

170
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,080
David Goggins is this navy seal
who now is more or less uh,

171
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,560
uh,

172
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,460
like a motivational and
a fitness influencer.

173
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,730
The Guy who runs broken knees,
he's a fucking savage. Yeah,

174
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,090
I've seen some of his clips. How many?
100 mile runs that he run in a row.

175
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,210
Some fucking preposterous number.

176
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,780
I don't want to say cause I can't remember
it all. I want to say six or seven.

177
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,930
But then it's like 12 or 13 of 100 mile.
Remember I don't remember at all.

178
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,550
But his whole thing is stay hard.
Like he'll send me a text out of nowhere.

179
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,760
Like just say stay hard motherfucker.

180
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,240
She's out there. Yeah. Cause like
first of all, if you're a navy seal,

181
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,700
right?

182
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,700
This is the pinnacle of hand to
hand combat and armed forces.

183
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:51,720
Like those motherfuckers were all
special human and then on top of those

184
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:55,370
motherfuckers been all special humans.
There's guys that can just,

185
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,530
just put a little of that
message out like, hey you,

186
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,740
you are soft as fuck compared to how
people used to be all soft as fuck.

187
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,100
Compare it to those World War II people.
Those stay,

188
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,910
you gotta stay vigilant
back then everybody had to
stay vigilant. Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,010
You had to deal with just day to day life,

190
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,050
you have to deal with what
was coming from Hitler.

191
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,690
What a tune in at a certain time to
find out what was happening. Yeah.

192
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,920
Everybody had to gather
around the TV for the news.

193
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,070
That was all the news you got.
That's all the news you got.

194
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,010
You only got an hour's worth. That was
it. They just, what the fuck was going on?

195
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,110
Nothing. Nothing. And they were better
on record and they say, really? What's,

196
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,920
I'm so tired of that. They were better
off for it. I don't need to know.

197
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,060
Not better off for it.

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,590
Way Better off recognizing that you're
luckier than those people having some

199
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:44,790
fucking discipline.

200
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,390
Watching a David Goggins Instagram clip
and get your fucking shit together top.

201
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,090
No, I'm not. I agree with
everything you just said.

202
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,490
I agree with everything you just said,
but I'm saying you're better.

203
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,080
They were better off not being
fed a news diet 24 hours a day.

204
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,820
Mentally,
mentally.

205
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,230
We're the first human beings that
have had to deal with this on slot.

206
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,620
It's a double edge sword because if you
don't get fed that you don't find out

207
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:15,610
about Julian Assange getting kicked
out of the embassy in London.

208
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,940
You don't find out about a million
different stories that are in the news.

209
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,910
It's a fun story. It's a cool story,
but do I need to know it? It's a fun,

210
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,540
that's a quote for you from now on. Hey,
what about Julian Assange? Tom Papa,

211
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,900
hands up and close. It's a
fun story. It's a cool story,

212
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,970
but I don't need to know it. Holy
Shit. Really. I mean, really,

213
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,350
you just redefined white privilege.
Well, you hit it, you hit it on the head,

214
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,880
lit it on fire. No, it's seriously,

215
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:46,720
what can I do about a lot
of these, you know, look,

216
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:49,870
I think it's good that information is
flowing and that moves everybody forward.

217
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:54,490
But you know, for me, sitting
in there trying to tell
some jokes and feed my kids,

218
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,440
it's like,
do I need to know everything,

219
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,730
every trouble spot going around the world.
It's like,

220
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,130
that is a very good question.

221
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,420
It's like how much responsibility do you
have to be tuned in to all the events

222
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:08,680
of the world and to act like how much
responsibility do you have outside of

223
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,570
voting and do you have the
responsibility to vote?

224
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:14,350
Cause there's some people that are very
interesting people that don't vote. Yeah.

225
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,880
You know, I don't agree
with that. Yeah. It's a,

226
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,420
I want to participate.
I understand that. Um,

227
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,940
but I don't think Michael Mouse
votes doesn't, he does it.

228
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:29,020
Didn't he say he doesn't vote?
I think he said he doesn't,

229
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,600
I forget his reasoning, but it was very
logical. No, I understand the argument,

230
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:38,050
but I even, and even if it
seems kind of false and I just,

231
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,960
I think it kind of like mentally
engages you in the world.

232
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,690
It's like you should be
trying to participate.

233
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,810
I think his perspective is that
as a commentator on the world,

234
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,450
that'd be better off if he didn't
actually vote and just look at it how he

235
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:59,320
really sees it on both
sides. Right? Partial.

236
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,020
Yeah. I'm sure I'm butchering
the way he would phrase it.

237
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,470
Think it's in the spirit of that.
If you vote,

238
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,420
you don't have a right to complain.

239
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,160
All right. Okay. That doesn't even
make sense. That doesn't make anything

240
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,560
that was deep. Well, but I think,
uh, but look, it's, it's a lot.

241
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,710
Look,
I think it's trying to be a good person.

242
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:27,250
I'm just a person level and try and take
care of your family and work hard and

243
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,590
be good with people and
help your community.

244
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,400
That's kind of the extent of what you
can do. And hopefully that spreads out.

245
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,360
But you know, Julian Assan. Okay,

246
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,860
whoa. Really? I mean, why
is that, you know? Well,

247
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,660
like all those people that we're talking
about at that generation that only got

248
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:51,440
news during that six o'clock
hour, you know, were they less

249
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,540
citizens of the world because they only
got that little dose, I don't know.

250
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,280
They were less

251
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,880
formed.

252
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,970
And the idea is that more people can get
away with things they shouldn't be able

253
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:03,930
to get away with. Like what's happening
right now with Julian Assange,

254
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,500
Julian Assange in anybody's estimation,
if you look at what he did,

255
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,800
he distributed information
that was extremely interesting
to most people in the

256
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:18,850
world that didn't know about it.
Right. Exposed a lot of scary shit.

257
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,260
Yeah. He's supposed a lot of corruption
as opposed a lot of, um, I mean, what,

258
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,500
what corruption did it expose? I know
it exposed the, there was that, um,

259
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,140
was it a collateral murder video?

260
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,530
That was the f one of the first ones
where they showed them shooting.

261
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,140
They shot at,
um,

262
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,160
these guys where they thought
were soldiers and they
were, they were reporters.

263
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,610
And it was just sort of just
the way they dealt with it.

264
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,930
It was very scary for people watching
that someone could just like dehumanize

265
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,680
accidentally killing the wrong people.
I make it like the military,

266
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,570
they were the Megan at
like, you know, hey,

267
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,740
but you kind of have to be in that
mindset to be able to gun people down from

268
00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:59,140
the sky in the first place.
The whole look,

269
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,650
you gotta put yourself in the perspective
of someone who has to do that job and

270
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:06,250
you take a regular person and then you
train them to do that job and then you

271
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,560
ask them to go and pull
the trigger and people,

272
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,840
they're going to develop a coldness
to them. Yeah, they have to. Right.

273
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,803
But to see it,

274
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,870
so with Julian Assange did is he showed
it to us and then he released all sorts

275
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:21,370
of, I mean, I, I've, I haven't,

276
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't
really studied all the files and what was

277
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:29,620
released and what wasn't apparently
was when Ben Shapiro was here.

278
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:33,280
He said that, uh, people's
names got a put out.

279
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,940
Apparently that was someone hacked into
wikileaks and release that information

280
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,660
before they could redact the names.
This was the,

281
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:45,250
this is what I've been told by multiple
sources. But again, I didn't look into it.

282
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,630
I don't know if that was correct.

283
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,170
So they're going to say that he
was treasonous or that he was,

284
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,240
I don't know what they're going to say.
I think the first thing was a sex charge.

285
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:58,130
That's what they were trying to say.
That he had sex with a woman. Um,

286
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,050
they wear shoes,

287
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,130
he wore a condom and then they had sex
and then they had sex in the morning with

288
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:07,450
no condom and she didn't consent to that,
that he just kinda did it or something.

289
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,380
I think it was something along,

290
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,390
I think they called it Soprise sex and
if I'm butchering this, I'm sorry. Um,

291
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,280
but the,
um,

292
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,270
that didn't make sense like that there
would be going after him that way.

293
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,360
Obviously. Not about that. Yeah.

294
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:25,390
You go after if you want to get
somebody to go after him for whatever.

295
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,830
I think there's kind of like hacking
charges now, right? Yeah. I don't know.

296
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,300
I know he's a little crazy in
the, in the embassy, right. He,

297
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,670
he wouldn't clean up after his cat
and he was riding a scooter around.

298
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:39,430
Is that true? That's what I don't
know. Who knows what's true.

299
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:40,290
I know that's part of the problem,

300
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,490
but that's what's part of the
little story that I caught.

301
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,520
The Little Duncan was
poetically describing what
the embassy must have smelled

302
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,130
like dirty cat shit

303
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,680
wafting through the halls. Yeah. Crazy
asshole. Do you have staying here?

304
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,531
Won't leave.

305
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:58,470
Pamela Anderson comes over every now
and then they get their free con,

306
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,760
the surveillance footage of Julian Assan
skateboarding in the Ecuadorian embassy

307
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:07,290
in London has been leaked. Okay.
Yeah, but here's the thing man.

308
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,540
Like what do you want the guy to do?
Is there a problem?

309
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,080
He's there for seven fucking years
now. He must have gotten crazy. I mean,

310
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:16,160
that's like being, you know,
under house arrest dude.

311
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,530
I mean it's amazing that he lasted
that long and what they did,

312
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,920
they waited them out and then when it
there, we're never going to wait him out.

313
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:25,800
He was gonna stay in there forever.
And then I guess got sick of him.

314
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,390
They just get sick of him. I think
it was also the Ecuadorian president.

315
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,070
I think he took a
photograph in front of a,

316
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,110
like some lobsters and shit and it was
from a leaked email in that photo got out

317
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,220
and it was very embarrassing to him
because his country's in deep financial

318
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:49,221
crisis and he's chilling in some
foresees and somewhere he loves tearing

319
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,450
lobster. Yeah, well I
don't know. I mean, look,

320
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,460
it's funny that when you
see pictures of Trump,

321
00:18:56,461 --> 00:19:00,380
he's eating Kentucky Fried Chicken. When
you see pictures of this dude, he's,

322
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:05,410
he loves her and Trump phrase Kentucky
fried chicken was fucking private jet

323
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,270
hilarious. He really loves that stuff.
He really, he fucking loves fast food.

324
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,070
Like when he got all those athletes,

325
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,590
when they came to visit him and the
government was shut down and brought them

326
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:20,160
all fast food, he didn't understand
it. Like what the fuck this shit.

327
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:23,910
And then he had another team showed up
months later and he broke out the fast

328
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:27,030
food again. The government was
hope. Just imagine the fucking,

329
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,900
you're going to see the president
of the United States and you are a

330
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:32,880
professional athlete. Yeah, right.

331
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,400
Your body literally is a temple and
they were college athletes, but oh,

332
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:42,210
they're college. I would still
listen. Let's be real about that. Huh?

333
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,080
How much athletes should get fucking paid?
Crazy.

334
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:51,081
That's the biggest robbery and all of
that bled ex college sports to get into

335
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:55,830
the NBA and the NFL,
but you're making billions off these kids.

336
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,920
Fucking billions. Don't give
them a swell. Much money,

337
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:03,870
$20 fucking fast food.
I'm telling you,

338
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,740
man, this guy, in terms
of like material current,

339
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,290
it's almost like we glutton doubt.

340
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,740
It's almost like Trump was ice
cream like when he was in office.

341
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:18,741
He was so good for comedy that it looks
like there are so many Trump jokes now.

342
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,250
Everyone's like, no mom anymore.

343
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,060
I can't take another bite. He's, I need
something else. I can't have ice cream.

344
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,370
These are one more bite ice creams going
to come check it out of your throat.

345
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,770
It's really true. It's so,
he's so fucking eccentric,

346
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:40,650
like good or bad.
Just look at him as a human.

347
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,740
It's such a rare human. Yeah. You
know, I mean you've seen it with the,

348
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,780
with the hair and the constant golfing.
Even though he shit,

349
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,940
he shit on fucking Obama Golfing
and he's got way more than him.

350
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,610
He doesn't even try to pretend
these about a hypocrite. No,

351
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,380
he's just everything.
He's just the fat American on a jet Ski.

352
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,214
Just letting it rip.

353
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,810
Curious if you know what's also hilarious.

354
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,610
I think this is a real thing. Trump
derangement syndrome. I think it's real,

355
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,790
but you mean people that are obsessed
with him and they're obsessed with,

356
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,520
you know, this is the thing
that's going to get them.

357
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,230
He'll be out of office in three weeks
instead of like looking at it like this is

358
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:28,231
the argument for a guy like Michael
Mouse that he's an objective analyst.

359
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,390
Stepping back, looking
at this, he's doesn't,

360
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,020
he doesn't have a vested interest in this
guy winning or that Cayenne and when,

361
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,710
and he's just going, hmm, what is this?

362
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,610
Sitting back and watching this is
if I'm going to take that position,

363
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,850
not emotionally involved because some
people get so emotionally involved they

364
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:46,510
can't sleep, they start crying, they
think it's the end of the world.

365
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,730
The world is exactly the same.

366
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:53,320
We just have a different figure head
and I think it would present challenges

367
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,720
that will make us more
understanding of each other do.

368
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,110
That's what I really think.
I think there's,

369
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,780
there's good and bad
about every situation,

370
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,870
but the pro I see is communication.

371
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,120
If we're just honest with
the way we communicate,

372
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,710
I think people on the right and people
on the left, they share a lot in common.

373
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,900
There's a lot, a lot that
they share rather than what
they don't share in common.

374
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,970
The only thing they don't share is what
they're watching. How others. Right.

375
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:26,050
And then also the vibe you get like this,
the vibe from these,

376
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,970
whatever, whether it's CNN, whatever
show you're into, MSNBC, Fox News,

377
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:35,560
they all give out a vibe and that
vibe is, you know, we are right.

378
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,110
Here's what's going on. Here's
why that's a problem. You know,

379
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,430
and everyone has a different problem and
everyone thinks they're right and then

380
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,940
you have, so you have
different things. You,

381
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,920
some of them are have like eagles
and flags and Tom Fox News.

382
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,010
Yeah. I'm into that kind of truth.
Gimme gimme that shit. Yeah. Fucking,

383
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,660
yeah. Yeah. Come over here
the right way. All right guys.

384
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,710
Yeah. Yeah. Fucking neighbor.

385
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,100
Let him over to you a fucking day,
bud.

386
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,410
Rachel Maddow trucks and hats and
guns and so that becomes your team.

387
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,330
That becomes your claim.
That's what it is. It's the
team thing. Most of it and it,

388
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,390
and the,
the unfortunate part is both are saying,

389
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,620
are spending so much time rather than
thinking about this is the problem that we

390
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:21,454
have to deal with.

391
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,360
They're spending all their time thinking
those other people are assholes. Right,

392
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,580
exactly. It's being, it's the,

393
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,500
the venomous attacks against a fellow
Americans because they have a slightly

394
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:35,920
different view about healthcare.
That part is the,

395
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,970
the derangement of the culture right now.
They're not enemies. They're Americans.

396
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,190
You know, we're all on team
America. Exactly. Greta,

397
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,480
this fucking thing in that, bro.
Exactly. Those were all together,

398
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,170
which I sat the bench.

399
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,020
It is a wild country when you travel
around and look at my phone, watch this.

400
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,310
Then you got the flag
blowing in the wind, bro.

401
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,880
It moves.
I believe in America is a concept.

402
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:06,080
I don't think it's a bad thing to believe
in America as a concept where we're

403
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,030
getting better. We're,
we're working on this.

404
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,720
I think this idea that the people were
complaining that someone put the American

405
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:16,430
flag on a cop car and
a California that shit.

406
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,220
Yeah. Like, Hey, this
is, we're in America.

407
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,940
What do you mean they put us
rod back and flag on a cop car?

408
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,490
Like just draped it over it.
No,

409
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:28,220
like they had like the side panel where
it says the police department has the

410
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:31,770
American flag incorporated into their
logo. Like what do you hate America?

411
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,150
What's wrong with that? I like
it. Yeah. It's pretty like it.

412
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,570
I fucking salute those cars as they
drove by on a beach. Yeah. Problem.

413
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,020
Who doesn't like the American flag?
What's wrong with being a patriot?

414
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,940
It's imperialism, man.
Everything. It's all the good too.

415
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:51,920
It's all the creativity. All the art,
all the love, all the positive people,

416
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:55,910
all the opportunity people. It's
amazing. We're one country. Look at this.

417
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,830
Oh my God,
let's see this fucking quote.

418
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,190
We have such an amazing community of
artists here and I thought the aesthetic

419
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:03,200
didn't really represent our community.

420
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,440
This person said it feels very aggressive.
Bitch.

421
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,910
You're in the winters team, right? Okay.

422
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,330
You were in Laguna biatch aggressive
and artists and Laguna beach.

423
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:17,960
Just loving life. Marguerite is
everyday at four it's aggressive.

424
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,750
That's why you can walk around
with flip flops. You fucking idiot.

425
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,670
It's aggressive.
It's not aggressive to you.

426
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,820
It's not aggressive policing your friends,
the whole,

427
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,310
if something happens to your house,
who do you want to come near?

428
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,210
This water is water
color kit or the police,

429
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,410
but then not even saying that like
the police car, the colors on the car.

430
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,090
They're not saying we shouldn't have
police saying that flag is too aggressive.

431
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,560
It's the flag and the police
like that is the flag.

432
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:51,140
Make it more aggressive. That
is so stupid. I don't get it,

433
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,860
but it's that thought process.
It's just something wrong with us.

434
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,890
Well there is that there is that knee
jerk reaction from people on the far left.

435
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,410
The thing, everything
we do is evil. You know,

436
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:07,910
from the beginning of the country to now
we're just corrupt and evil and awful

437
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,040
than why you still here now.
Why are you going to the arcade?

438
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,090
They would all admit that it has great
qualities of problems is the problem is

439
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:21,800
when people really focus on
only the negative aspects,

440
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,140
the negative aspects of this country
are real. They're real, of course,

441
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,620
some top to bottom in every,
in every,

442
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:30,500
in every group of human beings
and negative aspects are real.

443
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:35,501
But this group of human beings in a
relatively short period of time has this

444
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:41,270
group of human beings has managed to
accomplish insane architecture, music,

445
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,460
comedy,
writing

446
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,520
it and dominate the world.
I mean it's a crazy fucking weird place,

447
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:51,760
but you dominate the world
in a democratic sense, right?

448
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,570
With with a democratic election
in the, in their country, ladies,

449
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,560
mostly peaceful manner.
The real problem was,

450
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:03,510
and then you start wondering like what
the United States does outside of this

451
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:06,000
country and whether or not they
should be doing it. Right. It's like,

452
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,820
are they doing this because they have
to do this because this is the way the

453
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,100
rules work in that country or I mean,

454
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:14,430
why are they propping up this guy
when this guy is clearly a dictator?

455
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,050
Is it better to have the dictator in
charge and have it become a failed state

456
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,780
like Libya, all the shit that's way
beyond our pay grade. Right, exactly.

457
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:26,100
It gets screwy. You say
like, yeah, I don't like what
America does overseas. Okay.

458
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:30,690
I don't exactly know what they do and I
don't think you do either. No, exactly.

459
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,620
I think there's some, until Julius tells
us clearly, some people know, right?

460
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,910
Some people are super educated,
informed. I'm not, I'm not denying that,

461
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,330
but what I'm saying is that most of
the people that have these really

462
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,830
aggressive opinions about
these things, yeah, and look,

463
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,810
there's don't necessarily think they've
thought about it too deeply. No,

464
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:54,770
but you also know that, you know,
look, everybody knows the country.

465
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,350
Does some dirty stuff in
places that wasn't cool,

466
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,870
what funds your country
doesn't. You're right. Exactly.

467
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:01,610
Wait,

468
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,520
the thing things these militaries and
these countries have to do in order to

469
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:06,354
keep peace and

470
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,790
yeah, and, and, and you know,
you want to shine light on that,

471
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:13,990
so maybe it's not done
again, but it's, uh, it's,

472
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,530
it's part of the thing that we're
talking about before about like our

473
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:21,640
grandparents not having a lot of the
information in a way that you're living in

474
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,070
the dark and that's bad,
but in a way,

475
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,410
you're living in the light
now and you see everything.

476
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,150
The problem with seeing everything,

477
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,430
I think it kind of is a problem is
that you realize that no organization,

478
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,930
no country,
no government is flawless,

479
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,340
no person, they're flawed.
Everything is flawed, everything.

480
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:46,780
And now we have this idea that
if somebody isn't perfect,

481
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,100
they should be just run out of
town. Cancel. Yeah. Canceled,

482
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,210
kicked out of office, whatever.
Yup. We're all flawed.

483
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:59,380
Everybody's flawed. And this idea,
because we can find everything else out,

484
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,420
you can expose everyone's flaws.

485
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:06,421
What we're going to have to come out
of this somehow realizing that flawed

486
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:11,320
doesn't mean that they're evil or they're
negative and they have to be kicked

487
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:16,300
out. Do you think there's ever
going to be a time in, in humans,

488
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,560
like whether it's a hundred years from
now or a thousand years now where there's

489
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:20,394
no war?

490
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,970
Yes,
yes I do.

491
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,770
How do you see that happening? Well,
it's going to start with cop cars,

492
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:30,730
with flags on them

493
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,570
and then they're going to put stroller.

494
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,870
I think it would be technology and I
think it's a matter of everybody becoming

495
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:42,370
more comfortable if you can,
if you can have people,

496
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,520
this is like a Thomas
Friedman idea that if,

497
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,200
if you want to stop like people
fighting in the Middle East, uh,

498
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,850
give them all the comforts
of a good society,

499
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,930
let them be able to go eat McDonald's
and sit in a coffee shop and all of a

500
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:58,780
sudden you don't want to fight as much.
And that means prosperity.

501
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,090
That means popping.
So I think technology,

502
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,400
if you can bring more water to
people and there's less suffering,

503
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,190
if climate change doesn't
turn ruin all of that.

504
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,840
I think if you can prop these people up
and give all these people if they can

505
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,790
rise and there's no sense.

506
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:16,750
I mean we're in a point now where there's
fewer wars than ever before on the

507
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:20,710
planet. Sure. So we're headed in that
direction. So I don't see why not.

508
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,250
Well, as a thought exercise,
let's look at it this way.

509
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,410
What makes anybody
decide to act as a group?

510
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,390
What makes anybody like if
why would we decide to go?

511
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,970
Right? What negotiations should we
be having with someone in Germany?

512
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,810
Like why,
why,

513
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,650
why are we having a conversation about
anything you live way the fuck over there

514
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:44,730
on the other side of the ocean.

515
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,600
What would make people act as a group
and go over and try to fuck with somebody

516
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:54,780
else that's, that's in another
place like, well, people can be,

517
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,370
people can definitely be rallied.
All right. For any cause.

518
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:00,120
Most certainly.

519
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,120
But do you think this is my thought that
there will come a time where that kind

520
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:10,190
of rallying doesn't work,
that people will stop believing?

521
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,200
I mean this is one of those very bizarre
ideas that the systems that we've

522
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,870
established for, for human civilizations,
whether it's countries or cities or um,

523
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,750
uh, continents, right?
Whatever it is, these systems,

524
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,230
once all the boundaries that kept
people from freely traveling, all the,

525
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:32,680
once those are, those all broken down,
no country anymore and they keeping this,

526
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,920
keeping it together now is
the fact that it's air travel.

527
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,260
So they know when you're coming in
and they get to check your papers,

528
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,070
you're flying in from overseas,
are you Mister Papa was only one way.

529
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,340
Motherfucker,
you got to land right here in this spot.

530
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:47,550
And then we take each individual and
we say, can I see your paperwork?

531
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,980
What do you got? Who are you, where
are you from? Where were you born?

532
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,380
Do you have money or you're a drug addict.
You have been arrested.

533
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,700
And then they're allowed. They could still
do that that way. If that didn't exist,

534
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,830
if it was way easier to go to Germany,

535
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,590
there was a technology
that would allow you,

536
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,350
like a person like you or made the
same way we could drive places.

537
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,450
We could just fly into
somewhere and land anywhere.

538
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,350
You don't have to go to a fucking
specific location like an airport or get

539
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:15,330
funneled through a road that takes you to
some, you know, some checkpoint station,

540
00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:19,650
like when you're trying to drive from
Mexico. Just if people could fly. Yeah.

541
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,480
If people, if people flew anywhere they
wanted to go, if that technology existed,

542
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,120
good fucking luck keeping people from
coming into your city. Good luck.

543
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,470
All those rules are out the window,

544
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,850
but it does all those immigration rules
that doesn't exist anymore. Can't exist.

545
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:36,684
People can go anywhere.

546
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,250
Right? But what are you saying
that gives you, well, the gives you

547
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,390
the interaction with
human beings like you.

548
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:48,020
You won't be able to get them as a group
as easily to go after another group.

549
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,130
Right. Because now there's
no country basically. There's
no like thing to, right.

550
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,160
We're not part of this that has to
go fight that. Right. We're all in.

551
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:58,850
We're all one now here's the do have one
person lives in a great spot and they

552
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,990
don't want to give up their oil, right?
Right. Then it becomes a problem, right?

553
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,810
Come on, resources. We're all in this
together. Those people in Alaska,

554
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,410
you know they got all that
fucking oil, bro. Here's how.

555
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,490
Here's two things though. Here's two
things of why it might not work. One,

556
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:19,090
still this college, but I only
two that I can think of. Okay,

557
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,320
let me hear a one.

558
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,380
Italians are Italians and Germans are
Germans and Mexicans are Mexicans and you

559
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:30,830
get around your people and you feel it
and you know it and I know who you are

560
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:34,880
and we're part of that tribe and we're
part of that thing and it doesn't matter

561
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:35,960
that we grew up somewhere.

562
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:39,380
I just know you as an Italian and
I'm an Italian and I am with you,

563
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,700
and that is very different from that
Turkish guy over there. That thing,

564
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,260
that very human thing,
chemistry thing of your own blood,

565
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:51,650
your own thing. I don't think
that's going to go away for Bro.

566
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,760
You're old school and you bake bread.
I didn't, you're talking nonsense.

567
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,400
It's truly things. You're the old
timey thing. I do love all the time.

568
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,110
He thinks your eyes without glasses.
You'd be like, Nah, I liked the class.

569
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,650
I put him on and get ready to go to work.
But I think that's a real thing.

570
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,660
Horse cars and your friend,
your friend, you give him, Hey,

571
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,810
this shit is actually
really good for fertilizer.

572
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:18,490
All right,

573
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,670
well I'm going to blow your mind with
my technology in this conversation,

574
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,200
which I just read an article
yesterday that in uh,

575
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,330
China face recognition is the thing
that's going to stop your fantasy of

576
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:35,050
everybody just loving each other and
going around in China there with face

577
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:35,651
recognition,

578
00:34:35,651 --> 00:34:40,651
they're able to recognize and
categorize Muslims in the country.

579
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,140
There's like this one sect of Muslim
in China and they're with all this face

580
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:50,200
recognition that they're seeing, you
know, from your phone, from everything.

581
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,500
They're starting to catalog
the enemy and they're,

582
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:58,240
and they're going to be able to police
or sharing information and hotels and

583
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:02,560
everybody and they're all
now through this network. No.

584
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,210
What type of person just walked into this
building and whether they're friendly

585
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,850
or they're the enemy and that thing,

586
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:14,851
that face recognition thing is PR could
end up splitting us apart even more old

587
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:19,600
timey.
Tommy with his technological facts.

588
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,340
China's big brother
surveillance technology isn't
nearly as all seeing as the

589
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,720
government wants you to think.
This is kind of like a,

590
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,540
they might be able to upgrade it
though. It says it can't for sure. Yeah.

591
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,970
That's one point.
Oh,

592
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,960
when your phone unlocked
with your fingerprint and
it blew your mother fucking

593
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:38,880
money, you're like, Bro,
it's really, it's my finger,

594
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,890
pinky and even worse, my pinkie five
fingerprints on this motherfucker.

595
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,970
It'd be give consent as I could to do
the side of my thumb and it's still knows

596
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,260
his glasses. What do you
mean with that? As a cop?

597
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,190
It's a cop with Google last year. It's
got some sort of face recognition thing.

598
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,750
It's like that time grows that
Tom Cruise movie minority report.

599
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,580
What was that real?
Yeah.

600
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,430
Not Tom Cruise is definitely there.
I don't know,

601
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:13,100
but that's, you know, I try to
Google glass on once I actually, oh,

602
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,700
through a whole UFC Wayans wearing the
Google glass. How was it filming it,

603
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:21,960
I guess? Um, ah, it wasn't ready.

604
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,230
It wasn't ready and I think that's
why they haven't upgraded it.

605
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,150
Let's hold off because this is
not working. It's been a while.

606
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,660
It's not new to that Dorky Shit.

607
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,970
And people got super uncomfortable
when you around them.

608
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:36,570
It's like holy a camera on everybody
walking around with a fucking camera

609
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:39,720
everywhere.
I think they'll have something eventually,

610
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:43,500
but I have a feeling it'll be
something where there's a technology.

611
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,270
What were the outside you,

612
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:50,490
you can't see things when the inside
you can and then they'll show you images

613
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:54,030
like directly in front of you on the Lens.
So like you wear glasses,

614
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:58,770
like your glasses, but it'll show
you things right in front of you.

615
00:36:59,430 --> 00:36:59,970
Yeah.

616
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,480
I got one that I heard that I don't know
if I understand and believe that this

617
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:03,901
is real,

618
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:07,110
but I just googled it and I
found something that makes
it seem like it's so the

619
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:10,950
next version of the VR
headsets are supposed to have
brain tracking in them and

620
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:15,770
that sounds super, but it's already
being implemented and tested.

621
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,630
You get a knock on your door.
Are you thinking about as beaten off?

622
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,750
What is wrong with you,
man? No, no, no. We,

623
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:25,380
we thought you were a regular person,

624
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,720
but you're beating off a
hundred times a week. Yeah.

625
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,410
You imagine if they wanted to
have a talk to you like Mr Papa,

626
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:36,030
you watched 14 hours of pornography
this week. Yeah. That seems a lot. Yeah.

627
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,330
I think your mother would think
that. It seems like, I mean,

628
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:41,880
I don't want to talk to her.
Say employers are going to do that.

629
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:44,560
Insurance companies are going to do that
and they're going to be able to hold

630
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,340
much. You're beating on how much you're
beaten off, how much you're working out,

631
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:49,340
how much you're sleeping,
whether and what.

632
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,830
Look at that to share only good stuff.

633
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,390
That's like Google when they
said don't be evil. Abandon that.

634
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,780
Once you started making money, they
fucking paint it right over that side.

635
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,940
Maybe a little evil. What is evil,
man? I mean, what is evil, evil?

636
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,700
Schmiegel we're going in
that direction. Yeah, man.

637
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,180
It's going in that direction and it's all
going to some sort of a wearable thing

638
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:15,250
that connects you, but a weird thing
that like everywhere you're going there,

639
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,360
picking off your face and then
you're going to be able to,

640
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:22,140
they're going to know exactly what
you are and who you are. Yeah. No,

641
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,440
it's a strange, it's strange. Uh, but it,

642
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,420
is it any more strange than our lives
today in comparison to people that lived

643
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:34,800
in 1920 like we were talking about
earlier. This is way weirder. Weightless,

644
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,080
super weird way weirder wearing
weird town already for sure.

645
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,250
You just hope it doesn't get into the
hands of people that can really mess with

646
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:45,960
you. Oh yeah. The people with the money
put the money and all the control,

647
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,790
they are going to be cool with
it. Right? Yeah, that'd be great.

648
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,490
There'll be all right. Yeah, that'd
be fine. Everything's gonna be fine.

649
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,530
Do you have a Alexa in your
house? Yeah, my kids do.

650
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,780
My from my one friend is
always trying to tell me,

651
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,700
just get that out of your house.

652
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:03,570
It's listening to everything that you
say and everything that you can do about

653
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,500
it in that room.
I had a question about that.

654
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,930
You know, neuro link might be
coming on soon or whatever.

655
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,160
I was thinking about like if,

656
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,030
if it got to the point where like say
we all got it and then everyone you knew

657
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:20,300
had it and there's like a thousand
people that have it when it hit like a

658
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,370
threshold point where you're like, ah,
not everybody should have this. We're,

659
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,270
we're good at this point right here.

660
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,650
How would you ever deny people
something like that? The cost,

661
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,170
they might be really expensive to know.
How would you ever,

662
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,900
I know you can't deny people that won't
like say if someone's coming up and they

663
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,300
want to try it and everyone else has it,
that would,

664
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,100
that would create a giant problem.

665
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,050
That'd be like if you said
that with cell phones,

666
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,110
too many people have cell phones. We have
to stop you no more buying cell phones.

667
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,640
I know.
That's why I sort of think like that.

668
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:48,610
There might become a big problem
with that. Why? What is darling?

669
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,890
But hold on a second.
I don't understand why you think,

670
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,700
I just sort of think that if, uh, in
the theory that you're going to let it,

671
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,930
thousands of people have instant access
to the world's knowledge at their

672
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:01,930
fingertips, at a, at a
thoughts like instant,

673
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,300
that becomes too powerful in the wrong
hands and the people that might have at

674
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:10,900
first might see the, the future problems
of that. I'm just, what I was wondering,

675
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,740
I was thinking way too
far. Jamie got high. Yeah.

676
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,640
That sounds like you got high and watch
superman. She answer. You say it was like,

677
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:22,400
no, that probably won't be a problem
or, well, no, I, I can't stop it though.

678
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:23,710
I don't sort.
I'm wondering,

679
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,400
I don't think that anyone can say
that's not going to be a problem. Yeah.

680
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,640
I don't know. I mean, what is a problem
though? It's going to be something.

681
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,900
It's going to be a something.
Yeah, it's going to change.

682
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,950
One has access to all the world's
information instantaneously. First of all,

683
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,900
colleges are going under sun.

684
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,670
That was my first thought was
like they're going to fight.

685
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,040
That happened fast and that all day
until I think they can. But yeah,

686
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,310
I just have to be able to,

687
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,290
the amount of money that you would make
off of something that made everybody

688
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:51,400
super smart. Yeah. There's no way
you can imagine if you found out,

689
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:55,480
how ironic would it be if you found
out that like Stanford and Harvard are

690
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:58,750
banded together to try to stop this from
coming out cause it would kill their

691
00:40:58,751 --> 00:40:59,584
business

692
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,660
guys together and it was like,
you know,

693
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,340
just like how college admission
scandals going down so great.

694
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,110
There was a scandal that all these higher
universities had banded together to

695
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:16,120
try to stop this cause he was
going to kill the business.

696
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,770
Everybody can know everything.

697
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:22,000
We tell them more than everything we
tell them I'm going on some college tours

698
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:26,050
already. Jesus Christ. Oh my God,

699
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,590
I really makes you think. I'm like,
what did I do? They really need this.

700
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,980
This is expensive. Oh, do they
really need a a degree in all of

701
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,710
this? I don't know. It's a weird
businessman. It's a total weird business.

702
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,500
Don't know why it costs so
much. I'll tell you why. Why?

703
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,420
Because the administrators are all
making bank. Is that what it is? Yeah.

704
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,470
It's all the money that's going on.
So all these kids,

705
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,890
generations are in debt because they
have to take these student loans because

706
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:57,440
college is more expensive
than ever before. Well,

707
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,400
it hasn't changed running the
university lead the teachers,

708
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,790
it's the administration of these giant
universities are making so much money.

709
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,430
They're making millions and they
keep cranking it out and they keep,

710
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,000
keep needing to up the up the rate and
then they make money accessible for the

711
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,810
students through loans and then they
keep feeding themselves. It's horrible.

712
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,820
It's a horrible corrupt system. And
it's um, it's also subsidized rent.

713
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,540
Well, the government will
subsidize something. Yeah. Yeah.

714
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,310
How much does the government subsidize
private education? Private education.

715
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,020
That's, I don't think Hannah. Yeah.
Yeah. You got fast. Full on now. Yeah.

716
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,930
It's so expensive. I mean, you
know, isn't that weird too,

717
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:45,560
there's like state schools, private
schools. Yes. They all cost money.

718
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,880
Everything costs money. Yeah. Like
what is it like to get to like USC?

719
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,890
How much is like a semester at
USC? 70,000 no, not as a master.

720
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,110
A year. A year. Is it 70,000
roughly 70 50 for the year.

721
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:05,060
Yeah. That's like the, that's the,
that's the online Google search thing.

722
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,680
That's 50 plus room and board plus all
the rest of them. If your kid fucks off,

723
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,330
yes. Which of course they're going to
do. And by the way, to have 50 grand,

724
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:18,670
you need to make like 80 right.
Or taxes you to be,

725
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,280
how to make 80 grand. Yeah. For a whole
year of your kid being in school. Yeah.

726
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,480
And if your kid's just
doing bongheads totally.

727
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,980
My father dropped me off to school
at school and I was like a sophomore.

728
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,030
It just drove me into,

729
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,360
into college and drop off my stuff and I
was so psyched to go see my friends and

730
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:47,560
just kind of, you know, just work hard.
Be Responsible. Okay. Dad. Okay. Okay.

731
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,070
I go running into my, uh, dorm
room. My buddies are there.

732
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:55,200
I haven't seen them all break
Tom. They hand me a bong. Hey,

733
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,620
I light up. As soon as I walk in,
buy bags or haven't even trap,

734
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,790
I light it with my lighter and this huge
flame comes out and almost like lights

735
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:05,330
my fire. I'm like, why? Blah, blah, blah.

736
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:11,010
Hey Papa, your dad's outside. He's
in the van. I had forgot something.

737
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:15,870
I forgot a lamp in the van. I
go running out there. I'm like,

738
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,120
Hey, what's up? You know, hope and I don't
smell. He goes, hey, you forgot your,

739
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,750
what happened to your eyebrow?
Your eyebrows burnt off.

740
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,950
What did you do in the two minutes?
I just took the lamp. Thanks Dad

741
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,670
checks. He's writing checks for me
to go and do. Yeah, it's brutal.

742
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,220
Jesus. Actually more that
was just tuition. I saw,

743
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:46,590
I see 75 $75,000 USC one year room and
boards 15 three that's got to be low

744
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:51,180
because that's just about it.
Over a thousand a month.

745
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:54,810
It's kind of be a man and
that's without like if your kid,

746
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,110
if you live on the east coast and you're
flying your kid back and forth and all

747
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:01,650
the rest of it, look at personal
expense, personal and miscellaneous,

748
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,960
1400 bucks for the year for the hundred
bucks a month. Get Out. That's crazy.

749
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,370
Yet it, forget it. The books,

750
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:10,910
they're going to be way
more than a hundred bucks a
month to the books are going

751
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:14,700
to be 1200 a semester. Probably.
You should go to state school.

752
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,870
You pay a quarter of that.
Stay in, get your undergrad.

753
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,100
Things like you could have a
nonsense education like me.

754
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,370
Well you just read things that you're
interested in and then you never get like

755
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:30,570
a real base education.
I don't have a degree in anything.

756
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,420
He didn't go to college. I went
to college, but I fucked off.

757
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:37,080
I barely paid attention. I
went to Umass Boston, so yeah,

758
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,920
that's when my sister went. I didn't
even take my sats. No, really? No.

759
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:41,400
There was like a,

760
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,550
they had like a continuing education
program and you just sign up and start

761
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,700
taking classes there. Oh Nice.
Did you go the whole way? No,

762
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,130
I went for three years.

763
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,330
I was barely paying attention
three years I did it.

764
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,800
I guess I realized I was doing it a little
bit while it was still doing standup,

765
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,790
like while I started doing
stand up. Uh, it was,

766
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,090
it was literally only so that people
didn't think I was a loser. Right.

767
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,990
I just wanted to let people know I'm
doing something I didn't pay attention at

768
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:11,190
all. Right. I will.

769
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:15,660
All I was thinking about was a martial
arts competition and then it was stand up.

770
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,890
Well, yeah, the transition right there.
Yeah. Once that happens, forget it.

771
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,580
And once I realized that people made
money doing standup, that's when I quit.

772
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,250
It depends on what you want to go do.

773
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,210
Like there's certain you want to go in
law or you want to do certain, you know,

774
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,960
Madison, there's certain
routes where you need a degree.

775
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,580
We really need a degree and
there's definitely something
good to going to school

776
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:41,630
and being around other people from around
the country and all kind of thinking

777
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,870
for sure. It's all positive,
but you should not go into debt.

778
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,260
I have all these nephews
that they got out of school,

779
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,930
$30,000 in debt. Right? This is
the start of your life as an adult.

780
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:56,430
The worst 30,000 in debt.

781
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,960
They can't keep up with the payments so
that and the interest kicks in and after

782
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:01,621
four years,

783
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:06,621
now they owe 50,000 and they're constantly
chasing it and now they ask their

784
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:11,880
parents to help them out and they co
sign now you have two generations and

785
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:14,120
they've got to pay taxes. Right. And,

786
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,460
and they're now on their second
job where no one cares anymore.

787
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:22,280
Where you went to school, they never even
asked the question. They don't know. Not,

788
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:26,810
not an s now. No. In certain
places. Yeah. In certain routes.

789
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,130
Really depends on what you're trying to
do. Right? You've got to be a doctor.

790
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,400
Think they care.
Yes.

791
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,630
I think they care. Oh yeah. Well
maybe it depends what kind of doctor.

792
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:37,480
There's a lot of that. Just a professor
you probably applying for jobs,

793
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,130
a history professor. I went to
television production, whatever,

794
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:41,590
and no one gives a shit.
Well that's true.

795
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,560
If you're going to do Hollywood type
jobs. Yeah. Nobody gives a fuck. No.

796
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,000
Go working in construction.
You can do what

797
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,540
my whole thing is, and I keep
trying to say this is my daughter,

798
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:56,620
is that you should never don't
jeopardize your future for this degree.

799
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,030
You can get degrees, there'll
be important. They'll help you,

800
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,840
but you should not strap yourself with
debt. That's why the advice. Yeah,

801
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,720
very wise advice and she's like,

802
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:11,260
how about you work harder and just pay
for it and I won't have to be in debt.

803
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,130
That's a good thing for her
to say. Yeah, it's clever.

804
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,820
Very smart to set you up
and my other daughter,

805
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:23,230
I'm just going to give her head shots.
$300 a head shots right in the business.

806
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,970
The business done that old show business.
Hey,

807
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:32,470
everybody's crazy. But I thought
showbiz people crazy. Everyone's crazy.

808
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,350
Every girl crazy. I'm crazy. Yeah.

809
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:38,830
The people who you think insurance
salesmen, people are fucking crazy.

810
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:43,110
They just better at hiding it all day.
Yeah. That's what they're doing. They,

811
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,490
that's what they do. They hide
it. They hide it all fucking day.

812
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,660
If you were really smart, he'd
just go into plumbing. Listen,

813
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,200
there's not a lot of plumbers
out there need plumbing. Yeah.

814
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,940
And you make a really good living at it
and there's not a lot of people that are

815
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,230
learning these skills anymore.

816
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,500
That's what you should go do or do
something you really want to do.

817
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,500
Find something you really want to do.
Yeah.

818
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,420
Maybe you don't want to
be a plumber should be a
requirement that they know what

819
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:10,030
they want to do before
they go into college now.

820
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:14,110
But to see what college
should be is education would,

821
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:17,090
it really seems to be more,
it's like prepping you for the job for us.

822
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,170
You know what I mean?
There's education as well,

823
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,440
but it's prepping you for the job force
and nowadays at least in a certain

824
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:27,500
segment of the population,
you're,

825
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:31,630
you're getting these colleges that are
also like socially indoctrinating kids,

826
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,830
socialist ideas and a lot
of ideas that you know,

827
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:40,420
just are contrary to what probably
their parents taught them.

828
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:45,660
So then there's this internal dispute
and who's right and who's wrong and do I

829
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:50,920
rebel against my parents? Both
full social justice warrior. Yeah,

830
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,113
yeah,
yeah.

831
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,870
Join the young Republicans on campus and
the El kids are just trying to find who

832
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:59,200
they are. Yeah, there's definitely
when you walk onto these campuses,

833
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:01,690
even just to tour them,
which I never did when I was,

834
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,520
I just picked one out and went,

835
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,990
but you go in the personality of
each university is so dominant.

836
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:11,710
As soon as you walk onto the
campus and went to some small, uh,

837
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,800
really left liberal arts schools and
you just feel like the posters and

838
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:21,520
everything, you're just like as a, as a
white male, you're not welcoming at all.

839
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,970
And then you go to some other places
and it's just kind of free flowing and

840
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:28,880
everybody's just, it's into this,
they're just all about the football team.

841
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,640
Have you ever seen a poster? It says I
as a white male, you're not welcome here.

842
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,730
Yeah.
Where in my daughter's room.

843
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,170
That's hilarious. No, but you
know, you like, it's like very,

844
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,420
very progressive and
very, you know, every,

845
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:52,240
everything is an issue and that's
where you develop those ideas.

846
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:56,150
But what I'm saying is you can really
learn from going on these campuses like,

847
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,290
oh, this is, well, there's a
vibe. You get indoctrinated,

848
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,050
indoctrinated into whatever
vibe the campus holds.

849
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,320
You get social points for like following
those ideas as hardcore as you can.

850
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,360
It's ready. It's really interesting. Yeah.

851
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:17,240
If you take yourself out of whichever way
you lean, if you lean left, you can say,

852
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,510
well, it's because they're
young and they're passionate
and they're right. Right.

853
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,660
He'll lean right like God,

854
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:24,440
they're babies and they're being taught
by people who never made it in the real

855
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:27,160
world. The only just
in academia and, yeah,

856
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,000
but just look at instead
of looking at it like that,

857
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,590
look at it where you don't have a fucking
dog in the fight and just step back

858
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,700
and go,
this is fascinating.

859
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:38,150
It's like people are just
trying to change an influence,

860
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:42,860
people's thinking and behavior and
some of it is to justify their,

861
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,750
their own thinking and behavior.

862
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,110
Some of it is because some people
just like controlling people,

863
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,000
like getting people to listen to them,

864
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,570
and some of it is because they genuinely
think that this is for the best for the

865
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:56,450
human race and it's all these
things are competing together.

866
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,670
That's why you have some people that
are activists and you meet them.

867
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:00,080
They're not annoying at
all. You're like, God damn,

868
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,690
you were really cool because they're doing
it with the right heart, right? Yeah.

869
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,660
Yeah.
Of activists that are so annoying,

870
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:10,070
so annoying because they're not
doing it for the right reasons.

871
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,970
They're nailing it to try to change
people because they want to poke you.

872
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:14,540
They want to,

873
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,000
they want to have a reason to be upset
at you because you're not listening to

874
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:21,050
them. You're not following their ideas,
them and there. Those are the key words.

875
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:25,730
It's about them, them and their status
and their power over you and yeah. No,

876
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:28,310
I know there's a couple of people,
you know,

877
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:33,410
there's a couple of people I know that
have gotten that way so hard that you

878
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:37,400
can't even have conversations with
them on both sides. It doesn't help.

879
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:41,480
It doesn't, all it does is
create more, more conflict.

880
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,270
Like that can of combative
attitude creates more conflict.

881
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,180
You can be right on every single issue.
What if you're super,

882
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,300
super combative all the
time that people just don't,

883
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,720
they don't want to communicate with you
and they're now willing to enter into an

884
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,530
honest exchange with you.
Cause it's always a contest.
There's a battle going on,

885
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,560
right? And you always think you're
right, right? It's US versus the,

886
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:03,350
and they're just looking for little
clues and see where you're at.

887
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,200
And if you give them any kind of
hint that you might lean one way,

888
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,440
they just pounce on you and it's brutal.
It's like this,

889
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,890
it's a horrible way to live. And
they're angry. They're just angry.

890
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:16,550
They just walk around with his anger.
It's like get an ice cream cone.

891
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:20,210
Enjoy your life a little bit.
Like what are your core Dodgers fans?

892
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:24,170
That's what they are core sports fans for.
The Democrats,

893
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:28,690
like our fucking team's going to kick
their fucking ass in 2020 Trump's going

894
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,130
down. Right, exactly. It's really
bad. It really is that, hey,

895
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:36,750
did you see tiger yesterday? Today? I
was watching it while we were in Georgia.

896
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,340
We were in Georgia for the UFC and I had
a comedy show out there and we were me

897
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:45,040
and um, Santino or watching
it on the screen. Uh,

898
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:49,200
on Saturday or yesterday. We watched
it Friday or was it Friday or Saturday?

899
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,740
Saturday. So Friday, Saturday
in anyone yesterday. Well,
whatever days it was, right.

900
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,330
I think we watched it two days in a row.

901
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,920
It was in the gym every day we were there,

902
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:59,670
but then I got home and I saw it
on my phone. I was like, Holy Shit.

903
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,440
I don't even give a fuck about golf.
I know I'm going to speak powerful.

904
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:08,250
I made a comeback, a huge comeback
with that. I mean, that's amazing.

905
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,560
Seven years later,
oh my God,

906
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,740
somebody's put on Instagram.
One of my quotes. Oh yeah.

907
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,540
That I attached to that.

908
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:23,340
It was pretty cool that I
love a guy get like, I love,

909
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,960
what did I say? I love a success story,
but even more than that, I love a guy,

910
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:31,920
fucks his life up and then gets it back
together again. Story. It's the greatest,

911
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,120
it's the greatest.

912
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,750
When you realize how much of us good
it must feel to that guy of top of the

913
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,870
world again. And then he like, yeah,

914
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,880
it was so messed up in the back problems
and troubles and the kids and the wife

915
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:48,300
and the thing and he just 11 years.
Yup. And he didn't stop working.

916
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,170
He just went to work and went to work and
went to where he is it 11 years later.

917
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,420
And so he won major championship
recently. Right? Did anyone win one?

918
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:59,480
It was a big deal. He won a major
championship within the last,

919
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:03,090
it wasn't a manager, but it was, it wasn't
a major this, this was the first major.

920
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,850
He's one in 11 years. Okay. So
the other one wasn't a major,

921
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:09,150
but it was a big event. It
was a big tournament. He wins
that whenever I was like,

922
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:13,800
wow, he might be back. He can, he can
fucking win big tournament's again.

923
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,060
And then he just,
Oh,

924
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:18,960
it was so cool to see the crowd just
kept building over the weekend and by

925
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:20,940
yesterday it was massive.

926
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:25,640
Thousands of people around the
green just hanging on him. Oh,

927
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:29,040
the relief that you saw just
coming out of him was so great.

928
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:33,480
And then at the end like he walks off
where as a kid he was only like 21 when he

929
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:36,840
went in the first time
hugging his dad at the edge.

930
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,600
And now he comes off 11
years later all this time.

931
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,840
And His dad's passed and
he's hugging his child,

932
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:47,250
his son now he's the father
in the same spot. Oh,

933
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:51,930
it was just, I was trying not
to cry the whole time. Oh,

934
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:55,230
it was such a tear jerker what relief.

935
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,610
People were just so happy for
him. Wow. Such a great story.

936
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,950
We do love a comeback to why not
man, you love a comeback. We,

937
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,610
we're all flawed like you
were saying before. But yeah,
man, being able to improve.

938
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:13,560
That's what that guy did. He sit
down and in pre improved. Amazing.

939
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,720
Improved his life. Yeah.
And never stopped. Yeah.

940
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,330
It went south and he picked it right
back up. Brought it north again. Yeah.

941
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,460
11 years of doing it and failing,
failing and failing.

942
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,530
Is that beautiful? It is
beautiful. Such a cool thing. Yeah.

943
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,620
I was wondering like he wears that red
shirt, he's got to wear the red on Sunday.

944
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,280
It's like his, that's his
thing. That's his thing.

945
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,180
And he was in the light colors
on a Saturday and I was like,

946
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,540
does he just like free himself from that
or is that a superstition that you got

947
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:49,270
to kind of hang on to? Good
question. Yeah. You know,

948
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,530
what do you think would happen if there
was an openly gay black guy with blonde

949
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:56,520
hair who only wore pink,
who was like the best golfer a lot.

950
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:02,260
It started dominating some dude who's
like super duper gangs and he's just got

951
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:07,300
this fucking crazy drive and,
and he gets down on the ground.

952
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,650
He could see the way the, the earth is
rolling and the whole time he's doing,

953
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:15,520
he's like lists bit snapping, his fingers
wiggling and, but you know, I pop pretty,

954
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,770
what would happen if he
started just winning? They
would probably poisoned them.

955
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,240
You think they would poison him

956
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:26,350
like a super flamboyant gay guy who
was willing. Okay. Black or white,

957
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:28,930
they would poison them.
So what do you don't think so?

958
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,700
I don't think so because golfers are so
close to flamboyantly queeny gay. Anyway,

959
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,140
look at their outfits. They're all pink
and like, Oh my God. Big Plaid pants.

960
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:41,440
They're like a bunch of old white dudes,
straight white dudes who want to be gay.

961
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,490
But it's all this country club life.
Right? The big part of it. Yeah,

962
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:48,860
but she had to have that guy swishing
around back and forth in the locker room.

963
00:57:48,861 --> 00:57:53,750
Snapping his fingers.
Staring at Dicks. No, no, no,

964
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,560
no.
They're going to,

965
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,070
he's putting,
he's gotta,

966
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,910
he's gotta catch phrase hair
shaved except for a curly manbun.

967
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:07,090
It just pop straight up and it's blonde

968
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,610
and he wears lipstick and
he's a motherfucker at golf.

969
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,610
He's just killing fools.
Does love my irons.

970
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,530
Maybe it would maybe would open golf up
to everybody else. Yeah. What happened?

971
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:23,260
Like do you think that tiger woods,
tiger woods,

972
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,350
he opened up golf for people of Color,
right?

973
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,550
Clearly we got into it because of and
how many, how many people got into golf.

974
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:33,490
There would've never even thought about
playing golf. For sure. Tiger could play.

975
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:37,180
Started opening up to inner city schools.
We're starting to get involved in it.

976
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,900
What about the gay community?
Are they represented in professional golf?

977
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,430
Flamboyant dress like the BGS
and the 70s they're close, Joe.

978
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:49,080
They're wearing plaid pants. They're
wearing, they're wearing tassels.

979
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,710
You xenophobia.
That's how people from Scotland Trust

980
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,980
saying, I was just saying they would,
they would be embraced. You know,

981
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:01,060
Scotland's a weird place.

982
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:06,061
Like you have to dress a certain way when
you hunt there or at least they have a

983
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:09,610
certain way. They dress like a
traditional way. I like that,

984
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:13,300
but it's not like they don't wear
Cammo. It's like an outfit. Yeah.

985
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:16,220
It's like an outfit. Like what are
they were they were like close,

986
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,400
weird old timey clothes. I like that. I
like tradition. Um, yeah, I know you did.

987
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:23,234
That's why I brought it up.

988
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,640
Bordain went hunting in
Scotland who's television show,

989
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,970
right? He had to wear some
crazy ass outfit. Right.

990
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:36,260
You get suited for this outfit.
That's traditional hunting outfit.

991
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:41,200
It's pretty cool. A lot of those, but
it's, it's, it's, it's true. Chicago.

992
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,770
Those places like Scotland too.
If I'm in,

993
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,410
I think most of it was like private land.
Right.

994
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:51,290
I think back in the day like that was
what Robin Hood was all about. Right.

995
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:55,190
Robin Hood was originally supposed to
be about someone who was poaching and

996
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:58,820
hunting on the king's land because they
were hungry and so they were stealing

997
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:02,420
from the rich to feed the
poor gentlemanly pursuit,

998
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:07,220
hunting and shooting a tire. Wow.
How they dress. Does that help you?

999
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,720
Helps me be a good hunter cause aren't
get to goof on them or does it like does

1000
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:14,480
that help? Does that get in the way
of hunting or is that help hunting,

1001
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:15,710
but that's how I help and shit.

1002
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:22,100
I'm tired of as a kind of fresh
though. Go back to his boots. Yeah man,

1003
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:24,500
that guy looks at his boots.
Can you make them boots larger?

1004
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:28,040
Look at those fresh boots.
I wear those on stage.

1005
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,110
Would I get in trouble for cultural
appropriation wearing someone's stuff if

1006
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:36,830
they're white too. I was at work and know
that if they're more powerful than you,

1007
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,770
then you're okay. Like how does
that work? How does that work?

1008
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,870
You can't take from how much,

1009
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,800
what percentage of native American do you
have to have in you to wear moccasins?

1010
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,290
Who a lot. The castle jacket. How about
the, like the Suede tasseled jacket?

1011
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:52,163
I,

1012
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,800
but they're like Roger
Daltrey rebels in the 70s war.

1013
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:03,230
I wanted one of those so bad when I
was in high school. They look so cool.

1014
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:07,130
The easy rider with the fringe
on it. It's all moving. Driving,

1015
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,800
man. I wanted that arm out the window
of the car and it's flopping around.

1016
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,790
You're on stage singing. The
ladies must love you. Oh,

1017
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:19,910
Gloria [inaudible] strips a leather.
See you. But that goes too far.

1018
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:23,640
See how it's because they have the
native American thing on the sleeve.

1019
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,300
This one right here? No, not that
other one. Well that one. Yeah,

1020
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,890
it's too far to that one.
If you do that one,

1021
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,090
you better kill the bear that you used
for those fuckers. Yeah, that's too,

1022
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:39,110
that's ridiculous. There's a white guy
version of that, which would be okay.

1023
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,520
That's a girl claims to be a
healer. Yeah. That's where that,

1024
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,880
see if you were that in Texas,
you're okay? Yeah. Okay.

1025
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:53,270
Daniel Boone. Yeah, I'm here
with that one. That one's dark.

1026
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,980
Dark one. Now what do you prince
and you're like, that guy.

1027
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:01,220
What do you a trapper that's too light.
Bat looks terrible.

1028
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,100
That guy looks terrible.
He's got the fringe of the bottom.

1029
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,900
That's what's going to separate us from
else the curtain and on the bottom or

1030
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,310
fringe. A Nice Kurt and then
a fine. A fine restaurant.

1031
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:16,910
We'll get Elvis. Elvis had
tassels. Elvis had rainbow tassels.

1032
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,450
You could get away with it
if you're Elvis, if you,

1033
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,150
if you're working for enterprise,
rent a car,

1034
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,850
I think you may be here.
You don't wear that.

1035
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,160
Elvis got away with some wild shit.

1036
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:33,660
Who the fuck we'll jumpsuits before Elvis
jumpsuits. It was him and evil Knievel.

1037
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:38,340
Okay. Oh Man, look at that
Hendrix. Oh my God. That's,

1038
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:42,540
yeah. See, but he's doing something. He's
playing the guitar, he's moving around.

1039
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,220
He's got a headband. If you just, if
you're making snow cones, you don't,

1040
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,940
that's not your jacket, man. I
wanted one when I was in high school.

1041
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,000
I warm up a little bit. Never put that
back up. Put that picture back up.

1042
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:58,190
Look at that. That look, how good
does it look and I could never wear,

1043
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,740
he's got Fred Gianna yet.
What does that greenish yellow,

1044
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:06,540
how would you describe that color? It's
like a teal, like a light teal light teal.

1045
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,920
He's got, he's got bell bottoms, bell
bottom jeans, washed bell bottoms,

1046
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,220
and he's got this cool jacket with fringes
that are literally two feet long and

1047
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:21,120
then a headband to, and it's just his
kind of Fuchsia. The had been right.

1048
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,040
It's kind of reddish, like a light
red and he's, it's on Jimi Hendrix.

1049
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:27,480
That's the,

1050
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,540
that's the thing that we can't match
when we could buy all those items,

1051
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,250
but it's still our head.
Jimi Hendrix,

1052
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,170
knowing that it's 2019 to back then,

1053
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:40,410
like he was in the groove
man. Oh Man. He was the, yeah.

1054
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,940
Phil Hartman saw him live when he was a
young kid. Phil was like 18 years old.

1055
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:48,870
He got a job at the
whiskey and his job was,

1056
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:52,590
you know how they have those giant
monitors on the stage and sometimes those

1057
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:56,150
things would fall like into the crowd.
Who Cheats?

1058
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:58,800
Like especially if someone's
standing on that are doing a show.

1059
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,230
So they're kind of, they're a little
wobbly. So standing right there.

1060
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:03,960
So his job was to stand
right by the stage,

1061
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:07,950
like literally have his hands like
ready to catch these speakers.

1062
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:11,160
This was Phil's job. Yes.
And Hendrix is right there.

1063
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:15,140
Hendrick is right there
and he's 18 oh man.

1064
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,950
Oh my God.
Right in front of them.

1065
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:22,770
Let the thing just all seeing
the same Christ sign of them.

1066
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,480
Geez Louise.

1067
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:29,520
Kiss the sky.

1068
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:36,330
I was that close to blues traveler once.
I don't think that's the same.

1069
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,490
And this will his harmonica in his
past shortly before Jimi Hendrix died.

1070
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,680
Oh really? Yeah. Oh well he died when he
was died in like he was the magic age.

1071
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:48,840
Right? 35 was it? It's 20 everyone.

1072
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:53,880
The Magic Age is 27 it's an all time or
Marsha anise. Isn't that the magic age?

1073
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,260
Didn't he? Where did he 27.
Wow. Yeah. What year did he die?

1074
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:02,760
Was it 69 70 70 1970. So Phil, you know,

1075
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:07,580
that's amazing. I feel it was probably
like 17 years old or something like that.

1076
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,160
God, fuck. That's amazing. Yeah.

1077
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:15,300
Did he ever do one of those fringe
jackets? I don't know. I didn't ask that.

1078
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,010
But the way you describe
it, man, it was way he

1079
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,950
described. It was like running into Jesus
while you're out on a hike. Oh yeah.

1080
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:27,910
It was crazy. Well, Phil was a musician
too, so when you know he talk about it.

1081
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:32,500
We can,
I like this crazy clean too is hot cheese.

1082
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:37,090
It was right fucking there. Right
there. Yeah. Come on. Don't,

1083
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:40,930
don't Hendricks please.
I wanted a,

1084
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,420
I wanted one of those fringe
jackets when I was in high school,

1085
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:45,850
so I played football until I was a senior.

1086
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:48,250
And then when once football season's over,

1087
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:51,370
I have a half a year
left of school and uh,

1088
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,150
that's when I smoked weed for the first
time and started playing guitar and I

1089
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,770
want to win a fringe jackets.
I didn't have him,

1090
01:05:56,771 --> 01:06:01,120
but I did get a pair of moccasins
for a little while. I wore moccasins.

1091
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:04,260
Did they have beads? They did not have
beads, but they had the little French,

1092
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:08,350
a little tassels. They were like, it
was just a little fringe. Yeah. No soul.

1093
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,330
What's the purpose of French like?

1094
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,630
That's like when you think of a trapper
jacket, right? When I'm Dan Boone.

1095
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:17,800
Davy Crockett type dudes style. Give
him wearing that style is really, yeah.

1096
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,540
Why would they have any style back then?

1097
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,570
Everybody's got style back then it
seems like they were just trying to stay

1098
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:24,940
alive. Yeah, the weak ones,

1099
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,180
but the cool ones are
still trying to get laid.

1100
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,200
I think Daniel Boone wasn't
trying to work it a little bit.

1101
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,420
Look at this.

1102
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,680
Buck skins are often trimmed with a
fringe originally a functional detail to

1103
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:41,070
allow the garment to shed rain
and to drive faster when wet.

1104
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:45,150
Because the fringe acid, a series of
wix to disperse the water or quills.

1105
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:48,090
Interesting.
Oh Wow.

1106
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:53,100
Buckskins derived from hears can clothing
worn by native Americans. Oh Wow.

1107
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:56,250
How about that? That's
genius. Smarter than you now.

1108
01:06:56,251 --> 01:07:01,170
So it hangs down and the
water goes through all the
tissue in the deer and gets

1109
01:07:01,171 --> 01:07:05,280
to the bottom. So those little things get
wet. But the thing that you're wearing,

1110
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:06,450
the touches your skin is dry.

1111
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,650
You would think by now that deer would
have had fringe on their outfits.

1112
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,660
I think the don't give a fuck.

1113
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:17,640
You're a really hot or that your body
temperature is much higher than ours. Oh,

1114
01:07:17,641 --> 01:07:19,860
really? That's one of the
weirder things about, um,

1115
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,660
when you put your hands on one
inside of them, they're really hot.

1116
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:29,370
Like if you're like 98 degrees, what
do they like? I don't know. I would,

1117
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:33,570
if I had a cast, I'd say it's, it's more
than a hundred. I would say that. Yeah,

1118
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:37,890
I bet they're probably like 105,
something like that. What is it?

1119
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:42,300
What's the lot of temperature?
It brought up the cooking temperature.

1120
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,450
350 degrees.

1121
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,340
They're cooking before we even catch them.
It's hilarious.

1122
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:56,920
That's why people love deer. You
don't have to cook them. Precooked

1123
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,760
they're preheated same as most undulates,

1124
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:04,780
which is 37.5 to 38.5 degrees Celsius,
which,

1125
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,560
which we don't understand.
I'll just type in pre heated dear me.

1126
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:12,370
38.5 degrees Celsius. What do you
think that is? If you had to guess,

1127
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:15,830
I don't have a clue. What was the,
what was the number 38 degrees? Oh,

1128
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:18,950
that's 105 is it?
No,

1129
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,420
it's like 90 99.5 to a hundred.
Right.

1130
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:26,620
In that same region like us one or to
hire someone with a little bit of fever.

1131
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,350
Oh, I did something that you
would, you would enjoy. You
might have even done this.

1132
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:34,250
Speaking of body heat, uh, I was
in San Francisco last weekend,

1133
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:38,630
really performing and uh, I
was working with my friend, uh,

1134
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:43,130
Kira Sultana Bitch, very
funny comedian. She kicks ass.

1135
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:44,211
She's Russian.

1136
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:49,211
She grew up up there and she brought me
to a Russian like bath house beat you

1137
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:52,130
up. Sticks? Yeah. Did you ever do that?

1138
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:57,140
They call it Banya Banya man.
Oh Man. You go into a sauna,

1139
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:01,580
a two level sauna,
so it's even hotter like up at the top,

1140
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:04,340
like an attic in a sauna,
super hot.

1141
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:09,620
And you lay down on this bench
and they take these bushes,

1142
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,750
he sticks and they were, they wet them
and then they start beating you with them.

1143
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,400
Not a lot of pressure.
It's too, it's so hot. It,

1144
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:23,280
you're in a sauna, you're already like,
really? Really. And then that thing,

1145
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,180
that thing is hot too and that
thing's hot. And with the,

1146
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:29,660
with the steam coming off of the branches,
as they're beating your back,

1147
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:34,160
it creates a little,
a little pocket that gets even hotter.

1148
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,190
So it just brings your body to this
super high temperature they're making and

1149
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,140
making whether they really
are anyway and uh, yeah,

1150
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:47,230
for about 15 minutes and you come out of
there and just feel to jump in the cold

1151
01:09:47,511 --> 01:09:52,040
afterwards. Yeah. Into a cold plunge all
the way under this really cold water.

1152
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,110
Amazing. Yeah. The Russians really
let that fade or a million inco.

1153
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,600
It was like a one of the
greatest heavyweights.

1154
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,290
If not the greatest
heavyweight of all time.

1155
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,510
One of the things that you'd
see about his training,

1156
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,780
what does it was that it was
very old school. Russian,

1157
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:08,860
like there's a lot of stuff on
the parking or in a, um, uh,

1158
01:10:08,861 --> 01:10:13,630
a playground just like they did a
lot of stuff on a playground and um,

1159
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,770
he incorporated the Banjara that
was part of it and like he's,

1160
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,540
you see him lying there and
they're beating him with
sticks. There you go. Yeah.

1161
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,970
You don't show time. So there,
yeah, that's what, yeah,

1162
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:27,260
they figured something out. You know,
all the pretty great invented sauna.

1163
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,220
They figured something out.

1164
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:32,020
There's something about that
extreme temperature that just, it,

1165
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,930
it's very good for your, your ability
to recuperate. You feel better.

1166
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:39,410
It reduces inflammation. I felt
great. Like I went in there,

1167
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:43,160
I've been traveling so hard over the
last couple of months have just been

1168
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:45,200
knotted up. I've just
been like, I was like,

1169
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:49,310
maybe I'll do this and then get a
massage after. Cause that'll really,

1170
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:53,960
the gentleman, he like a gentleman and
we didn't have time. She had to go.

1171
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,140
She was driving me. She had
to go do something. So we
only had time for that part.

1172
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:01,160
When I came out of the,
the, the Banya or Banya,

1173
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,760
I didn't need a massage.
Everything was relaxed.

1174
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:09,500
Everything had changed in just
like 15 minutes. It was great,

1175
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:13,410
man. I wish it was a, I don't know if
there's, they have them in la or not,

1176
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:14,190
but I'd like to seek

1177
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,640
them out. They know they have them in New
York. One in West Hollywood. There is,

1178
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,670
yeah. Voda spa or something like
that. Yeah. There you go bro.

1179
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:25,050
A lot of dongs keep you bit pants with
a lot of dogs. Clothing was optional.

1180
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,770
Hey, clothing optional. And
I'm with Kira, you know,

1181
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:32,800
we're like coworkers and she's
wearing nothing. She's her.

1182
01:11:32,801 --> 01:11:36,050
She's totally naked. And then there's
dogs everywhere. There's dogs everywhere.

1183
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,610
He's the dogs. She sees the
dogs. I see the downloads.

1184
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:43,470
We were the only ones covered up. Where
was he going? Dong skip stare in America.

1185
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:48,390
What's that in America. You can you do
this? Yeah. San Francisco. You sure?

1186
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,900
Yeah. Girls. He was walking in a
room with dogs. They were naked.

1187
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:52,740
The girls are naked.

1188
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,430
And I are the only ones with clothes
on because we worked with each other.

1189
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:59,160
Send in immigration,
send IC

1190
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,530
alert. Yeah. There's something going on
that Bro. It's just dicks everywhere.

1191
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:09,910
Open that door. You, you cool with decks
in front of you? I'm not. I was here.

1192
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,520
I was looking away. Cops just come in
and fucking masks on Madonna alert. Yeah,

1193
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:19,250
they throw one of those. What are those?
Uh, gas canisters that flash bangs.

1194
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:25,560
Just grabbing guys by their dogs.
Pulling them out until the paddy wagon.

1195
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,170
It would all run out. Grab there. Dot.
That's the first thing you've got to grab.

1196
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,960
Someone throws a tear gas
canister to explodes in a room.

1197
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,930
I'm wearing pants so I was
the only one with pants on.

1198
01:12:36,931 --> 01:12:40,650
And you can kind of feel like everyone
was looking at you like you're making us

1199
01:12:40,651 --> 01:12:43,650
feel like shamed because you're wearing
pants when it's just taking them off.

1200
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:48,540
But I couldn't, I'm with my po.
That's a tactic. That's what that is.

1201
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,210
That's a tactic. Yeah. What
kind of, what do you mean?

1202
01:12:51,211 --> 01:12:54,150
It's a tactic they're trying to
like, come on man. Shows your Dick.

1203
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,870
This is how you show up when you did.

1204
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:59,130
You get together with five of your buddies
and you all are real comfortable with

1205
01:12:59,131 --> 01:13:02,100
seeing each other's dicks.
We're going to get to see Mikey's Dick.

1206
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,870
How are you gonna do that?
We're going to shame them.

1207
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,050
I'm going to shame them in and showing
us his dick and we're going to take our

1208
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:09,000
dicks out.
We're going to walk into that steam room.

1209
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,380
I just going to let your nuts hang.

1210
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,720
Why does everyone want to see what
the fuck are you doing with your,

1211
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:16,470
but take your God damn pants off and
he'll be like go road or road. Jesus.

1212
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,650
Why does everyone want to
see Mikey so bad? Cause Mike,

1213
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:23,280
he probably has a little Dick, which
dance on? That's, that's what I felt like.

1214
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:26,160
I felt like everybody thinks I have a
small one because I got my pants up,

1215
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:30,960
but that's not it. Um,
purely for research purposes.

1216
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,740
I was a online the other night
googling into Dick Surgery,

1217
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:39,920
Dick and large and surgery. It was after
that billionaire guy actually died. What?

1218
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:45,120
Yeah, he was a diamond dealer. He was
in his sixties and I want to say he was,

1219
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,540
I dunno, it was in Europe
or somewhere. Anyway,

1220
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:53,790
homeboy got some Dick Surgery.
Lans died on the operating table.

1221
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:59,430
Wow. I didn't even know they're
doing that. She surgery. You don't,

1222
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:00,600
you don't let me,

1223
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,800
my grandmother had a saying don't let
anyone mess with your eyes or your Dick.

1224
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:09,150
Yeah, there it is. He Goes, uh, the
gentlemen had been hug. Where you going?

1225
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,250
Um,
he a heart attack in the middle

1226
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,870
of the procedure, which isn't Fda
approved and then says, is it safe?

1227
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:21,640
Dunton I think anytime you go
under it's not 100% safe and hey,

1228
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:23,890
anytime putting you under
and cutting you open.

1229
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,460
I went under for the first time
last month. It was an anesthetic,

1230
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:31,830
death souls from the anesthetic. That's
what I'm saying. They put you wonder men,

1231
01:14:31,831 --> 01:14:35,200
you could fucking die. I know. I was
worried about it and he's an older fellow.

1232
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:39,100
I think that guy was in his sixties
includes surgical lengthening,

1233
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:44,290
which involves cutting a ligament.
Hey,

1234
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:49,030
at the base of the penis or filler
injections. I'll go with filler.

1235
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,700
Let's see what you do with filler first
and then if I'm going to cut my deck

1236
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:56,070
later, stage two, they're
gonna use a filler. Cocky,

1237
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,680
foamy spray into the insulation
and they come through the asshole.

1238
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:03,280
What does this implant
for men? Ah, Jeez. Ooh.

1239
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,030
All clicked. I don't know.
Fall into, hold on. Hold on.

1240
01:15:07,031 --> 01:15:09,930
You're going to shove plastic and your
Dick. Is that what that guy has? Yeah,

1241
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,520
like a sling. Hold on. I'll go low. Stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop scrolling.

1242
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,590
Get off this page animation, but
no, no. Look at this thing you have.

1243
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:20,890
You can pick your size. It's
a sleeve. It's like a sleeve.

1244
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:24,800
You didn't show that Dick on TV or on us.
Just for you guys.

1245
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:29,580
Well then pull it up, bro. Work they,

1246
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:34,420
they can stick the extra long. What
if you're like, oh my God. Oh my God,

1247
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:37,990
this is so bad, but we're
looks like an gutter. A Shin.

1248
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:39,610
It looks like a little piece of gutter.

1249
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:43,690
A small incision is made just above the
base of the penis where your pubes are

1250
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,710
and the, okay. Then they slide
it down into your shaft. I got,

1251
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:52,210
I got one word for everybody.
What is it? Infection. Ah,

1252
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,800
what have you got? A Dick Infection. Oh
my God. I have one word for you. Popular

1253
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:02,650
to think that works. Implanted,
secure. Now hidden sutures,

1254
01:16:02,651 --> 01:16:06,220
which are generally not detectable
by a patient or whatever.

1255
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,090
So you have like this
sleeve inside the skin.

1256
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,480
I'll tell you what's going on now though,
in porn. This is some real shit they,

1257
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,840
they have,
they have GMOs only takes an hour.

1258
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:19,840
There's Gmo Dick's now you're way bigger.

1259
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:25,020
I was watching that old porn film
with a John Hayes when we were kids.

1260
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,410
John Holmes was the guy
with the biggest debt.

1261
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:32,730
John Holmes has irregular Dick compared
to porn stars for real especially,

1262
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,930
and this sounds racist.
Black eyes.

1263
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,120
Well of course this is in
the right direction though.

1264
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,240
I supplied to the day that it was like,
that can't be real.

1265
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,080
That literally can't be real. His
Dick was so big. It was preposterous.

1266
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:48,910
He probably had an 18 inch
dick 1818 inch deck. It was so,

1267
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:52,930
and it was thick around as your
fucking risk. It was ridiculous.

1268
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:55,300
There was a girl who was trying
to suck on it. I was like, see,

1269
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:59,170
I don't think the girls want that.
Girls like this. I mean, I don't know,

1270
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:03,010
maybe the girl was 50 pounds. I
don't think she, even if she was,

1271
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:06,040
he still had a 12 inch dick gigantic.

1272
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,130
It was so ridiculously big
that as was watching this film,

1273
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,963
I was like,
okay,

1274
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:15,700
what's happened over the last 2030
years with porn that we've evolved?

1275
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,920
Yeah.
He just got a lot of guys that have a,

1276
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:22,570
in the recruitment that,
yeah, I guess, right.

1277
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:27,230
The perception of what a Dick was from
like, yeah, here's what I'm saying.

1278
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:31,160
Like there's this implant that may or
may not work that we just watched that

1279
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:35,960
little commercial for and it's brutal.
Yeah. But outside of that, yeah.

1280
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:41,000
What would, cause like a girl of girls
wanted bigger boobs. They get a boob job.

1281
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,960
That's common. Yeah. We're used to
that. But guys with giant Dicks,

1282
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,460
I don't think they're getting operations.

1283
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:49,900
I think just these are just a
crop of dudes with giant takes.

1284
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,840
You know,
a new class of guys showed up.

1285
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,460
They're on another level
through Leah dicks are so big.

1286
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:01,880
This recruiting and the fuck.
We've had a real great draft this year.

1287
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,860
It's different.
It's like people,

1288
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:08,730
the big Dick dudes from like the 1970s
and eighties they had kids with people

1289
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:09,650
ate a lot of vitamins.

1290
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,770
Maybe it was an optical illusion
because we had more pubes back then.

1291
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:18,130
It was coming out of the forest. You
didn't see half of no, no, no, no, no,

1292
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,730
no. This guy was, these guys are massive.
Kind of had a snake. Yeah. It was a snake.

1293
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,990
It was a fat snake that you would
like capture in the everglades.

1294
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:31,810
This is why I kept my pants on at the
Banya. I didn't want people intimidate.

1295
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,490
If you've got a dick like that, you
just swing that thing anywhere you want.

1296
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,820
Whenever you want. It cares. Who Cares?

1297
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:42,830
Well, anyway, I shared this black white
dudes that have giant dicks too. I just,

1298
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,360
there's a couple.
I'm not seeing them.

1299
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:47,870
I'm not seeing him at the same with
the same. I'm just being honest.

1300
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:52,070
The limited amount of research that
I've done is there is a difference

1301
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:58,580
for I think what your defense mechanism
was, right? Like rightly to say.

1302
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:00,720
Yeah, women don't want that.
They don't want their giant Dick.

1303
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:03,990
That hurts him every time I get it, bro.
Come on. I know where you're coming from.

1304
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:08,480
You know I want my ladies to be happy,
not upset.

1305
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:14,540
Some girls want to be upset.
That guy,

1306
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,350
by the way,

1307
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:19,780
billionaire in his sixties and
even thinking about it stored,

1308
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:22,610
why are you even these board?
Isn't that amazing?

1309
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,100
Like if you've got that much
money's top and think about that,

1310
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:26,990
you're in your sixties
you got that much money,

1311
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,480
you have billions of dollars and how much
time do you have left and what do you

1312
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:31,250
do with your money and what
do you do with your time?

1313
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,930
You know the good dudes probably
fucking board of Shit we owe.

1314
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:38,090
Has it come down to sex? Why not just
get a hobby? You're so old. Timing.

1315
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:44,770
Each injection of hyaluronic acid fillers
cost between 250 and $750 and adds

1316
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:49,160
girth.
Ro said person.

1317
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,600
Patients usually begin with about 10,
10 injections,

1318
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,150
injection filler injection. Woo. Wow.

1319
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,310
Jesus Christ.
That's not good.

1320
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,630
The patient could have given
him general anesthesia,

1321
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,160
which may be exacerbated heart conditions.

1322
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,940
Oh, Jesus Christ. Scad heart. He had
a heart condition. This guy. Yeah.

1323
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:15,960
See they live at, you know what?
Hold on. Put that back on. It says,

1324
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:19,950
if you're getting general anesthesia and
you have an underlying malady in your

1325
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:23,220
heart, you will unmask that
and it will show itself.

1326
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,430
Jesus. People are so bored. So all this
money and it just makes you more board.

1327
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:35,150
Yeah. Ridiculous. I think
people just get on a path.

1328
01:20:35,151 --> 01:20:39,770
Right? And what is the path? The
Path is to, to acquire success. Yeah.

1329
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:43,430
And when you're doing something
like selling diamonds, you know,

1330
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:46,340
congratulations for making a lot of money.
People like to buy diamonds,

1331
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,410
but what are you doing? What
are you doing? Those diamonds?

1332
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,550
And you're buying diamonds, you're
selling diamonds, you're buying diamond,

1333
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:52,760
and you're getting older and you're,
you're, you're like, oh my God,

1334
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:56,310
I'm at the end of the ride. When am I
doing? What was this right about? Um,

1335
01:20:56,470 --> 01:21:00,050
I'm not dexilant figured out, fuck
Aa and one. Then we're going in,

1336
01:21:00,051 --> 01:21:02,480
we're going to take anesthesia,
we're going to get a dick fixed.

1337
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,310
But because he was just
essentially moving money around,

1338
01:21:06,311 --> 01:21:08,470
he wasn't making something easy.
You think that's it?

1339
01:21:08,471 --> 01:21:10,300
That there was no worth
to what he was doing?

1340
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:15,570
I think just like he wasn't being
satisfied mentally with his job,

1341
01:21:16,931 --> 01:21:18,040
with his work.
With his life.

1342
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,690
Yeah. I think there's probably a lot
of people in his sort of position.

1343
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:27,220
A lot of people who are billionaires who
are financier's and bankers and stuff

1344
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:30,040
where they're probably in a similar
spot where they're like, what do what?

1345
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:34,270
Unless they have something they really
enjoy doing outside of work, you know,

1346
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:38,650
it really captivates their time and that's
their passion. That's the case. Brow.

1347
01:21:38,651 --> 01:21:42,700
You're 65 get out. Yeah.
Get out of the work. Yes.

1348
01:21:42,701 --> 01:21:47,650
Stops that. Just get a different hot.
Wow. What are you doing? Yeah, but,

1349
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:50,760
but the other thing is when you're
around people like that, right?

1350
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,350
And this is not a bad thing.
It's a life choice.

1351
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,030
But if you're around philosophy people,

1352
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,300
if you're a person who likes Rolls Royces
and giant mansions and you know you

1353
01:22:01,691 --> 01:22:02,590
liked a baller,

1354
01:22:02,591 --> 01:22:06,520
I've got a big fat diamond ring
lifestyle that guys around those people,

1355
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:09,820
because he's selling diamond
rings, selling diamonds, diamonds.

1356
01:22:09,821 --> 01:22:11,900
Mother fucker got billions for

1357
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:18,040
$48 million. Ooh, look at
that blue, a blue diamond,

1358
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:23,100
48 48 million has a father
bought it for his daughter.

1359
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:27,160
Wow. Magic rock. Damn. Imagine if you're
the daughter and you lose that Shit,

1360
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,830
you're out drinking.
You know you,

1361
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,520
you're fucking pull your panties down
the P and a curb cause you're so god.

1362
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:38,520
I'm so fucking Hammond.
And I rang,

1363
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:41,950
my dad's going to kill slips right
off while you're throwing up,

1364
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,510
throwing up in a dumpster,

1365
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:47,760
uh, my dad's going to kill me. Yeah,

1366
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:48,960
maybe the daughter was 40.

1367
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:54,500
It makes you realize that the things that
you read that really give you worth in

1368
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:57,600
life is not the Joe.

1369
01:22:57,601 --> 01:23:01,050
It's something that's going to engage
your head and make you feel a little

1370
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:01,650
useful.

1371
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:05,590
You're way better off having less dough
and something you really love. Yeah,

1372
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,980
but that's only if you have a certain
amount of dough. That's the problem. Yeah.

1373
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:11,400
The stress of not having
enough money to feed yourself,

1374
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:15,040
feed your family and a roof over your
head. That's overwhelming for people.

1375
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:16,630
Especially as we were
talking about earlier.

1376
01:23:16,631 --> 01:23:20,050
If people have fucking credit card
debt or student loan debt or some

1377
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:23,920
insurmountable amount of debt that
can't get out of it just hangs on you,

1378
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,410
then you're not really thinking
about what's meaningful for my what,

1379
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,300
so it's meaningful hobby for me.
Oh Dude, it's the worst. Yeah.

1380
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:32,590
The feeling of debt is the fucking worst.

1381
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:36,460
And then the feeling of just working
for nothing. That's also bad too.

1382
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:40,630
There's the feeling of like every day
you're doing it just to exist and at the

1383
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:44,410
end of the day you're exhausted. So
what is your life? What is your life?

1384
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:47,170
Is your w your life, all this
shit you hate to do yet? Well,

1385
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:49,660
that's the answer for most people.
Most people,

1386
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,960
most of the time the answer is you're
doing something you hate to do.

1387
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:56,200
And it's been me, and I know it's
been you at some point in your life,

1388
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,340
but God damn the,

1389
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:02,410
the amount that your life can change if
you just no longer have to do something

1390
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:06,820
you don't want to do, you could do
something that you actually enjoy.

1391
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:07,331
Whatever it is,

1392
01:24:07,331 --> 01:24:12,331
whether it's carpentry or painting or
whatever the fuck it is that you love to

1393
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:15,760
do. Do you think it has to be your work
or do you think you could be at work or

1394
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:20,310
you're like kind of into it, but then
you have some other passion that's good,

1395
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:24,820
that satisfied. But you're also,
if, if your work isn't satisfying,

1396
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:29,260
that's most of your life. Yeah. You gotta
do what you gotta do. Of course you do.

1397
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,630
Of course you have to do what you gotta
do. That goes without saying. Yeah.

1398
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,680
So figuring out a way out of there,
everybody's got a way out. Don't just,

1399
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:41,500
people love to say things like that. Like,
Hey, some people don't have that luxury.

1400
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,230
People love to say things like that. So
you have to acknowledge that, but that's,

1401
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:48,490
that's the case with anyone who has ever
done anything where it was hard to do.

1402
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,100
Right. It's always, it's always
going to be hard to do that,

1403
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,680
that it's used for you to say it.
Of course. It's easy for me to say.

1404
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:56,590
I'm just saying that's the
easiest thing in the world.

1405
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:01,750
I'm going to put a rocket on the moon.
See, I just said, wow. Say exactly.

1406
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,280
I'm going. Of course, it's easy to say,

1407
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:07,600
but the difference just as
a person who's done bolt,

1408
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:10,630
the difference between doing something
you hate doing and doing something you

1409
01:25:10,631 --> 01:25:14,650
love doing, it's off the charts. How
much better your life is. No, absolutely.

1410
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:17,500
You're making less money even if you're
making less money. Exactly. Because like,

1411
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:21,310
you know, to use comedy as an
example, because it's what we are.

1412
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:26,710
When you were making $5 a night,
literally $5 a night as a comedian,

1413
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:31,960
I was so much happier than when I had
a day job. Oh yeah. Making real money.

1414
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,093
Once the,

1415
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:37,900
I remember the feeling of being able
to make a living with just stand up.

1416
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,610
Yeah. Like what? Like holy can and
not a good living. Just getting by.

1417
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:47,470
And my beginning, it was
super shaky. Shaky, right?

1418
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:51,880
Like I started making money. I was making
like a little bit of money in Boston,

1419
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:55,150
but always had day jobs when I
moved to New York. And then, uh,

1420
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:58,390
Jeff started managing me.
Then I started making money.

1421
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,790
Like he'd get me booked
in places and I was doing,

1422
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:04,310
I was working pretty much every weekend.
Who Was Jeff? Jeff Sussman. Sussman,

1423
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:08,900
longtime manager. Started managing me
when I was at open Miker Oh, nice. Yeah.

1424
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:13,100
We've been together forever. Well, he's
the best. He's still with them. Yup. Wow.

1425
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:17,540
That's amazing. Best. That's amazing. He's
the best. I love the guy. That's great.

1426
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,620
He's an awesome person too and
just a brilliant at his job.

1427
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:25,980
Super Low key. Doesn't give a fuck about
Hollywood. Oh, that's great. But you know,

1428
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:29,480
he's, he's, he understands it. He knows
what to do. Right. He hasn't care.

1429
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,350
It was like to do what makes you happy
once he just wants you to be happy.

1430
01:26:32,351 --> 01:26:35,420
It's awesome. So he picked you up when
you're doing open mikes too. Dude,

1431
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:38,510
I'll scrub it wasn't even supposed to
go on stage that night. Really? Yeah.

1432
01:26:38,511 --> 01:26:43,010
He came into town. He had managed some
other comedians. You Remember Bob Nelson?

1433
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:47,660
No, Bob Nelson Jeffy Jeff football
guy. Oh my God. He didn't manage him.

1434
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:53,300
Really? Yeah, he produced
his HBO special and um,

1435
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:57,050
they were parting ways and uh,
they were parting ways and Jeff was like,

1436
01:26:57,051 --> 01:27:00,320
well maybe I've seen everybody
that I've seen in a New York,

1437
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,550
maybe I'll take a trip to Boston.

1438
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:07,310
So he took a trip to Boston
and just fucking dumb luck
when I was driving limos,

1439
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:12,140
I wrote a joke that day. I had this
joke and I called up my friend Oliver,

1440
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,420
who was the manager at the
club and I said, hey man,

1441
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:17,630
can I come in and do like five minutes
cause I have this joke I want to try out.

1442
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:19,730
I said, sure, come on in. And he liked me.

1443
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:23,450
So he hooked me up and I went on stage
and I didn't even know Sussman who was in

1444
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:27,050
the room when, cause I didn't know he
was in the room. I didn't give a fuck.

1445
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,550
I was super loose. You knew who he
was at that point? No, I didn't know.

1446
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:36,080
I knew that there was a manager from
New York that handled Bob Nelson.

1447
01:27:36,081 --> 01:27:39,170
I'd be like, Holy Shit. I'd
probably freak out. Sure I'd choke.

1448
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:45,530
I mean, back to shaky is fuck back
then anyway, you know, I'm only like,

1449
01:27:45,531 --> 01:27:49,880
of course we wouldn't have three years
in a colony, so eat that. I was terrible.

1450
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,050
Yeah. Anything did often.
It was really interesting.

1451
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:58,450
Like he took me to New York to
um, he saw me there and then, uh,

1452
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:00,200
he took me to New York to try out.

1453
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:03,640
He wanted to see me perform in
some other clubs. So he said, we,

1454
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,750
are you willing to come down in
New York? So I said, sure. Yeah,

1455
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:08,920
I've always wanted to. I was so nervous
about performing in New York, of course.

1456
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:12,290
Thought New York City was different.
It was like more nervous.

1457
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:14,660
Then when he came to see me
the second time in Boston,

1458
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,640
I was more nervous to perform in New York.
It's like,

1459
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:20,360
I can't believe I was one of it. Catch a
rising star, which doesn't exist anymore.

1460
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:25,010
Just legends. Forget it. Your
head. Yeah. That's a big thing.

1461
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:26,960
It's an because you don't know it yet.
Yeah.

1462
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:30,980
Well it was like the New York comics
were always like the smart ones.

1463
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:36,020
Yeah. That was the thought process.
The insecure thought process in Boston.

1464
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:40,070
Like the audiences are smarter than not
going to buy your bullshit smarter over

1465
01:28:40,071 --> 01:28:43,970
there. Yeah, I know you're not fun and
you're going to know they're gonna know.

1466
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,740
And uh,
it's really funny.

1467
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:50,741
It's like sossman we were talking about
like clean comedy versus dirty comedy

1468
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,420
and there was no really real
decision like, you know,

1469
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:56,390
because back then people
would like decide to be clean.

1470
01:28:56,830 --> 01:29:00,470
It wasn't like you're a clean comic
because that's how you think. Well,

1471
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,130
if you want get more work,
the smart

1472
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,940
moves through the clean as a business
decision, as a business decision.

1473
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:09,750
It should dress nice and act clean.
Took me to this place called, uh, we,

1474
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:12,360
we went to a bunch of places.
It did eat side comedy club,

1475
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:14,850
which is a cool comedy club
that used to be in long island.

1476
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:19,440
Then he took me this place called fast
eddies and Huntington. And it was a,

1477
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:22,220
it was a local bar that
had a comedy night. Wow.

1478
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:24,600
And we went upstairs and it was so,

1479
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:29,310
the crowd was so fucking rowdy and so
drunk and there was a dude on stage.

1480
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:32,290
His name was George Gallows,
hilarious dude who, uh,

1481
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:36,510
was doing a reverse shit with a banana.

1482
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:42,660
He was like, as you're waiting to go
on. So he had a banana that he was like,

1483
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:46,050
he was somehow or another slurping it.
Like it was a reverse shit.

1484
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,440
And he's doing this in front of,
you know, these people are hammered.

1485
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,070
It's like a Wednesday night or some
shit. Right. And Psas and says,

1486
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,380
he grabs me by the arm. You don't
have to perform here. We're going to,

1487
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:58,830
we're going to get out of it. And I
said, no fucking way. I go, listen man.

1488
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:03,420
To my people. I go, I go, just trust me.

1489
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,630
Let me go out my paper. I'm
like, this is what I do, man.

1490
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,900
All the gigs that I got in Boston
for all bargains handle this. Yeah.

1491
01:30:10,901 --> 01:30:13,020
You got hard. You get
tough. Yeah. We'll also,

1492
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:17,760
plus it's once you've done a bunch
of them, it's like chaos. It's fun.

1493
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:20,160
You know what to do, what
to do. Yeah, for sure.

1494
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:22,590
It's a different kinds of
comments like combat comedy,

1495
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:28,070
which was at that time you ran into
that more than you didn't run into that.

1496
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:31,110
Even today,
if you get a road gigs,

1497
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:34,430
if you're a up and coming
guy or gal and you get wrote,

1498
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:38,890
especially if you're a Gao, girls got
get it way harder in the early days,

1499
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:43,891
like people like my friends girlfriend
admitted the other day that when she sees

1500
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:46,050
a female comedian at a comedy club,

1501
01:30:46,051 --> 01:30:49,830
she cringes still to this day.
She goes,

1502
01:30:49,831 --> 01:30:53,100
I get super uncomfortable when they
start going on stage and when they're,

1503
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,420
if they're funny, it's a huge
relief. I'm like, isn't that crazy?

1504
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:02,400
As a feminist, I hate saying that. It's
terrible is I consider myself a feminist.

1505
01:31:02,401 --> 01:31:06,270
I hate saying, I feel like it's gotten
beyond that. I feel like there's so many,

1506
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,260
oh yeah.
Such strong at the top of the chain,

1507
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:14,360
but if you're in some weird club in the
middle of nowhere and some, yeah, I get,

1508
01:31:14,361 --> 01:31:17,070
I get the, I get that fee. I get like,

1509
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,020
especially if you're a
feminist and you were around,

1510
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:22,530
you just don't want her to
bomb cause then you think,

1511
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:26,070
well they're all the rest of the audience
is going to think that's what all

1512
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:30,300
women are. Right. That too.
And there's that. She just
doesn't think they're funny.

1513
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:33,810
Very often she uses, she's not a comic,
so she's just being honest about it.

1514
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:38,430
And we were laughing because when a
girl says that you're like, oh no.

1515
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:43,140
But back then it was like eight
every time. Even in like good clubs,

1516
01:31:43,141 --> 01:31:47,890
like the comic strip or Caroline's,
it was just like, it was war war.

1517
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,910
It was war,
but nothing compared to like the the get,

1518
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:55,680
did you ever get any of those Bob Gonzo
Gigs in New Jersey? Oh yeah. Oh God.

1519
01:31:55,710 --> 01:32:00,340
Yeah. It was like a frat party.
That memory just threw you up.

1520
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:05,440
They didn't want comedy. Then
those comedy, oh they turn you,

1521
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:08,980
they sees in you in a different way.
They season you for like,

1522
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:12,700
like the comedy store was similar to that
for a long time cause the comedy store

1523
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:15,250
in the early days had no crowd control.

1524
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:21,480
Literally zero. Right. So the crowd
was in. It is in control sometimes.

1525
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:24,640
No one ever shot anybody
up. No. But the new regime,

1526
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:28,150
it's handled so much differently was
a new concept. It's so much better,

1527
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:33,120
so much better. But it did
make you bulletproof. Yeah.

1528
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:35,320
You knew how to handle drunk.
You came through that era,

1529
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:39,070
through that time or maybe it still
exists when you're going through,

1530
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:42,640
but if you do that many gigs,
that's why I don't,

1531
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:47,790
I really don't believe in just going to
your one little alt room over and over

1532
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:52,240
again where you know you're coddled and
supported and I really believe that you

1533
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:56,350
have to go into all these
hellish situations. So you just,

1534
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:59,470
anywhere you go,
you know you can go and kill.

1535
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:04,690
That's an important part to
being a comedian. And you also,

1536
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:06,700
as you become a successful comedian,

1537
01:33:06,701 --> 01:33:09,970
you could fall into the trap
of only performing in front
of your audience. Right.

1538
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:13,630
You know, you really do have to drop
in on other people's shows right here.

1539
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:16,150
People don't know who you are and why.
Yeah.

1540
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,920
That's what's great about
the storyline up to right.

1541
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:21,250
There's 15 comedians and they're
probably not there to see you now.

1542
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:25,470
Where to see this guy or that car
or, yeah, no, it's great. You know,

1543
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,720
you have to be able to survive because
you see people that come out of those

1544
01:33:28,721 --> 01:33:31,260
other environments and then they
get thrown into this and they,

1545
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:32,950
they don't know how to act.

1546
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,060
I think comedy is like a lot of
other things that are difficult.

1547
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,730
There's things that you can do
to get better at those. You know,

1548
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:44,200
like they say that like if you take,

1549
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:47,200
if you learn languages,
you could get better at chess.

1550
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:49,960
I read something about that. Does
that make sense? Did I make that up?

1551
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:53,530
That sounds about right.
I would learn a new language.

1552
01:33:53,531 --> 01:33:55,570
It'll make you better at chess.
I might've made that up.

1553
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:56,950
It's just the way your mind is.

1554
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:02,290
Trying to think if all the different
like cross training methods,

1555
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:07,390
how can it be better at chess? Do you play
chess? No, but I want to but I'm scared.

1556
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:11,950
It's fun. I'm scared. Why you
saw me play quake earlier?

1557
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:16,660
I have addiction, crazy addiction
problems. Chesses is addicting.

1558
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:21,690
Tom Papa walked in and Jeff and I were
going to war all we keep going at it.

1559
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:25,720
It was the most intense thing I've ever
seen you do isn't as dense accidents.

1560
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,950
Both of you on the keyboard and the
thing sweating your ass off in front of

1561
01:34:29,951 --> 01:34:34,070
these monitors. You were taking like
deep, deep breaths in the middle of it.

1562
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:37,510
Do you sketch is just firing off
at each other. It was intense.

1563
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:42,511
You ought to try to stay calm and these
were in this very small map so I always

1564
01:34:42,521 --> 01:34:43,390
know where he is.

1565
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:47,290
He always knows where I am and there's
a limited amount of ammunition and armor

1566
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,190
and when you get jacked and you come
back less strong with a weaker weapon,

1567
01:34:51,191 --> 01:34:54,340
you've got to run to get a good weapon
quick and then you've got to run to get

1568
01:34:54,341 --> 01:34:58,080
where the fucking armor is and he knows
where that shit is. So it's a crazy dual,

1569
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,730
like oftentimes if he kills me,
he'll kill me two or three times in a row.

1570
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,670
It was so much faster than I
thought it was going to be. Oh yeah.

1571
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:09,140
I mean in real intense, is it always
that like you're just in one four yard,

1572
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:12,800
one stone court yard running around
many, many maps. You can just go, yeah,

1573
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:15,300
that's a good one for
one on one. Oh, okay.

1574
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:20,380
We have these one on one matches the
most fun because there's no other

1575
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:23,780
variables. Right. The variables of like
if there's like 10 people, the Roman,

1576
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:25,790
everybody's shooting everybody,
which is a lot of these maps.

1577
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,890
I'll show you that too.
That's bring more chaos.

1578
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:31,430
Oftentimes you get killed when you are
fighting a guy and then someone comes

1579
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:34,160
from behind. You. Didn't even see
him and they shoot you some knowing.

1580
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:38,300
So how addicting is this for you?
Oh, real. Real. It's a real problem.

1581
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:41,150
You used to do it right?
Yeah, I'm way better at now.

1582
01:35:41,151 --> 01:35:43,340
I'll do it like for an hour and then
I'll stop and then you'll be good.

1583
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:47,960
In the old days it's very different,
but everything's addictive to me, man.

1584
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:51,400
Every time now. All of it.
Anything I like, I like,

1585
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:54,710
it's like it becomes addictive.
That's why your shoulder's messed up.

1586
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:59,780
That's from Jujitsu, but it's not, the
shoulder was more of a maintenance thing.

1587
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,490
It wasn't,
it wasn't that bad.

1588
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:04,250
It was just getting a little sore and I
wanted to get looked at and there's some

1589
01:36:04,251 --> 01:36:07,100
tendinitis in there. Right. So I just,

1590
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:11,780
I'm real proactive at 51 I have to
be real proactive about injuries.

1591
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,660
When things feel squirrely,
he, and it's the problem.

1592
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,770
You can get hurt and then you can't work
out anymore. Yeah, I like it too much.

1593
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:23,090
I like 'em, but even if it's not
something as intense as Jujitsu,

1594
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:28,550
I just need to do something.
Whether it's yoga or running is like me.

1595
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:32,420
No workout me workout.
I like me when I work out so much more.

1596
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:36,380
I like me better. It happened to
me in San Francisco after the day.

1597
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:40,610
After the bond. Yeah. I'm just, I
just woke up. I had good shows Friday.

1598
01:36:40,611 --> 01:36:44,750
I'm just like, but I just woke
up like kissed in a shitty mood,

1599
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:46,670
just kind of Eh,
eh.

1600
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,680
And I knew if I could just get
my shoes on and go for a run,

1601
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:54,500
I hold days going to be different.
Yup.

1602
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:57,890
And it's just a half hour just
going out doing and come back.

1603
01:36:57,891 --> 01:37:01,940
And I was a totally in the same room,
just feeling completely different.

1604
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,800
Not Crazy.
It's just a mental shit.

1605
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:09,940
You're flooding your brain with all the
beautiful thoughts and ideas that happen

1606
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:12,650
in there. And while you're
running, while you're breathing,

1607
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,470
he got all these fucking ideas that
come to your brand and get interested.

1608
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:18,470
You're breathing and you're running
your concert. And he brought me,

1609
01:37:18,471 --> 01:37:20,810
I'll slow down a little bit here. So what
does it look better? Then you're like,

1610
01:37:20,811 --> 01:37:24,580
fuck yeah, we're out here doing
it. I am running. Woo. Yeah.

1611
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:29,680
It's a big deal. Who knows what chemicals
are firing off in your brain? Man, dude,

1612
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:34,520
it's my dog and me because we run
together. Oh, like inseparable.

1613
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:39,020
Really. Just crazy. It's
hilarious. He follows me
everywhere. Like when I sit down,

1614
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:40,010
he sits right next to me.

1615
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:45,150
I've never had a relationship
with a dog like this.

1616
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,700
Dogs that I loved that were great, but
this dog is like stuck to me like glue.

1617
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:53,030
It's, it's so great. Part of
it is because we run so much,

1618
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,110
so thrilled.
He

1619
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:56,430
used to,

1620
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:01,430
so when we run he turns and he'll run
ahead of me and then we'll come back to me

1621
01:38:01,861 --> 01:38:05,280
to check up on me when it comes back
and runs with like this big smile on his

1622
01:38:05,281 --> 01:38:09,870
face. Like I can't believe
it's Ron runs again.

1623
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,570
How far are you running with him?
A couple of miles.

1624
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:17,190
That's grills is a pretty steep hills.
Oh, that's good. That's a workout. If I'm,

1625
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,420
if I have a short time,
you can do a little, uh,

1626
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,490
there's one real steep trail that I run.

1627
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,020
There's once each other we have
to drive to a little bit tasty,

1628
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:30,720
but it's super steep. Oh yeah. It's a way
out near like a Gora. That one's rough.

1629
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,230
That's a rough one. That's gotta be
tough. Yeah, because it's real long.

1630
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:38,820
It's like the whole thing is the hills
because the hills are no pounding. Right.

1631
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,580
You can get a good hill under
you. It's way harder. So I just,

1632
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:47,640
I base it on 140 beats a minute.
Anytime I get below 140 beats a minute,

1633
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:52,590
I just start running again. But I'll do
these sprints. I'll go as far as I can.

1634
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:57,090
I get it into one eighties and then when
I'm like, fuck, I gotta take a break,

1635
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,270
I'll just take a break and I'll look
at my heartbeat, get my heartbeat down,

1636
01:39:00,271 --> 01:39:04,650
note somewhere in the one
40 is 40 anywhere around
one 45 then I'm ready to go

1637
01:39:04,651 --> 01:39:09,210
again and then I'll go again.
And I'm usually like one
sixties you know, running,

1638
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:12,930
it's, it's rough hills or
rough, really rough and thing,

1639
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,130
but it's changed my kicking power. Oh,
he actually gave me more kicking power.

1640
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:21,150
Yeah, I can kick, believe it
or not, it's probably like,

1641
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,710
I want to say like 10%, five or
10% more power from the runs. Yeah.

1642
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:30,510
My pips or bigger muscles around my,
uh,

1643
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:31,500
like my butt.

1644
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:35,960
Like the hip area right where your belt
is like right below where your belt.

1645
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:41,160
I never had a muscle there. Right.
What is that crazy from the hills?

1646
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,800
This is all from running hills.
So when I stopped,

1647
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:46,140
like if I stomped the about
like a front kick to the bag,

1648
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:49,770
that that four thrust is the same
thing you're doing all the time.

1649
01:39:49,771 --> 01:39:51,150
When you're running,
you're running,

1650
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,990
you're pushing off one leg and you
pushing off the other leg and you push

1651
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,250
because you're going up a hill.
So when you're kicking,

1652
01:39:56,251 --> 01:40:00,060
you're pushing off that leg and trusting
that other leg forward. It's crazy.

1653
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:04,540
Is your dog a good on the hills? Does,
does your dog ever get tired? Yeah,

1654
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:07,800
he gets tired. He gets, we know
when they get tired, they get tired.

1655
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:11,040
When you throw the ball then
it's a sprint. It's a sprint.

1656
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:14,160
And then you bring it back, bring it
back here and it's like seven times like,

1657
01:40:14,161 --> 01:40:18,060
y'all bro, I'm coming to lie
down over here. You're like,
no, no, no. Come on man.

1658
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,640
Give me that ball.
Come on man.

1659
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:25,120
My sister has to put down her dog tonight.
16 year old dog,

1660
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:30,310
a big like, um, like almost like a
spaniel kind of thing. Wow. 16 years.

1661
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,173
And she's just,

1662
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:36,220
she's just been hanging on and she's just
been the greatest and tonight seven 30

1663
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:40,660
just has to go and just, there's no
joy left. She just can't go anymore.

1664
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:44,770
It's going to be rough. I've talked
to her on my way and it's just like,

1665
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:49,000
what a brutal thing to have to do.
16 years,

1666
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:54,370
my dog got hit by a car
when I was like 14. Oh

1667
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,420
14 or 15,

1668
01:40:55,480 --> 01:41:00,020
right in front of me taking her
across the street and we had,

1669
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:04,570
we had a busy street and her house and
some car came down the street really fast.

1670
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:09,610
Ah, she got off the leash and ran right
into this, hit her in a Volkswagen.

1671
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:14,230
Ah, yeah. It was rough to
it. I brought her up, stuck,
carried her up to the house.

1672
01:41:14,231 --> 01:41:16,920
Did she die instantly?
She died and like

1673
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:22,990
she died and looked in like 1520
minutes. That's so brutal. It's rough.

1674
01:41:22,991 --> 01:41:26,710
She started shitting all over the place.
How old was she? She wasn't that old.

1675
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:31,720
Maybe five or six. It's brutal.
There's nothing worse. Yeah.

1676
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,040
So painful. Sweet dog too.
Yeah, it was a bomber man.

1677
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:38,950
She just loved being in the park and we
were heading to the park and she just

1678
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:43,840
got a little too excited and ran, you
know, I didn't see the car coming.

1679
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:48,880
Ah, I didn't get ahold of her collar.
And Tom, it's brutal. It was so bad.

1680
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:52,330
It was so bad. She, but she, you
know, she got knocked flying.

1681
01:41:52,331 --> 01:41:54,340
I didn't even know she was going to die.
You couldn't tell.

1682
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:58,390
It was all the injuries were internal.
Brought her upstairs.

1683
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,120
She started shitting herself,
started shitting all over the place.

1684
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:05,320
It was very unusual for her. She
was, she's house trained, you know,

1685
01:42:05,321 --> 01:42:06,890
and I was really scared.

1686
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:12,610
Have you had to go through any pet
deaths with your kids yet? Yeah, the two,

1687
01:42:12,611 --> 01:42:15,430
my two dogs.
So I just had to put both of my dogs down.

1688
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:18,370
My dogs are around rational.
Yeah. Yeah. They were, um,

1689
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:23,950
13 it was a massive, and he
was 13. Wow. That's great.

1690
01:42:23,951 --> 01:42:28,390
Run at the end. I used to have
to carry him into the house.

1691
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:31,930
Yeah. He couldn't walk anymore. He
would walk like literally, we'd be like,

1692
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:36,100
he would walk it's step, walk us down,
you stay in his legs would be shaking.

1693
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:41,410
Had the kids handle it and they
were really sad. It's hard, man.

1694
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:44,320
Isn't that the hardest thing when you
watch your kids have to deal with it?

1695
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:48,070
So it makes it so much
harder. Yeah. I mean it's,

1696
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:52,330
but trying to be brave. I think there's
a lesson in it, you know, for real.

1697
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,910
I think it's a,
it's not a good experience,

1698
01:42:54,911 --> 01:42:58,690
but I think it's good for them to
experience. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1699
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:02,020
That's what they have to go through
it, you know, like pet death and,

1700
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:04,120
and just this,

1701
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:09,670
having those little relationships
with animals. When you're a kid,

1702
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:13,150
it's like your dog.
You could always talk to them and oh yeah,

1703
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:16,890
you can say crazy shit to your dog and
now you're talking to be sitting in your

1704
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:19,300
room with you and you go, you
know what? It's just you and me.

1705
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:23,800
You're the only one understands me. Woo.
You're parents are acting like assholes.

1706
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:28,220
No one likes you in the house,
but your Doug still does ship

1707
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,950
yells at me and going over on your way.
You're going to come with me.

1708
01:43:32,951 --> 01:43:35,710
Let's go out.
I'm taking the dog mom.

1709
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:39,820
Oh,
it's the past.

1710
01:43:39,821 --> 01:43:43,930
But watching your kids like trying
to be brave and trying not to cry.

1711
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:48,440
That is such a heartbreaker.
Just trying to be like, oh,

1712
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:53,420
I'm okay. Oh, it's just the worst.

1713
01:43:54,190 --> 01:43:58,430
He was like, kill me. Hey deedee,
notice deep up by your house,

1714
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:02,510
we have mosquitoes now.
Really? We have like legit.

1715
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:04,580
Then we never had mosquitoes out here.

1716
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:09,620
There's just like real mosquitoes and
they bite you only from like your knee

1717
01:44:09,621 --> 01:44:13,760
down. Everybody round where I
live is saying the same thing.

1718
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,140
We've never had mosquitoes. If you just
wear pants, then your problem is solved.

1719
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,570
I only wear pants. So how they bite in
you? Well, I take my shoes off on some of,

1720
01:44:22,571 --> 01:44:27,290
I don't do that. You're right
though. I have noticed mosquitoes.

1721
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:31,400
I noticed some last night. We never
had them in southern California before.

1722
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:34,010
I don't know where they're coming
from. Well, we definitely had them.

1723
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,260
We just didn't have many of them.
And this is how I know we had them.

1724
01:44:36,261 --> 01:44:39,980
I moved into a house once in Encino and
no one had lived there for like at least

1725
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:42,290
a year, I think. And the
pool had not been tended to.

1726
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:45,180
So the pool was filled
with mosquito larva. Ooh.

1727
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:51,280
It's like fish, like schools of
fish. Oh my God. Around there.

1728
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:55,960
And I was freaking out. I was like, what
is that? These fish. And I hired this guy,

1729
01:44:56,010 --> 01:45:00,110
Kevin, the pool guy. Kevin, the pool
guy came over and he was like, Brooklyn,

1730
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:04,380
those are mosquito
larva. Oh my God. No. Oh,

1731
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:07,790
maybe that's where they all came
from. It's a new thing. I mean,

1732
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:11,480
we used to have our doors open or
windows up and no screens, no problem.

1733
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:15,380
But now all of a sudden, just this
last year. Yeah, we're so sad.

1734
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:19,190
You have to live like the rest of
the world now. Why do I live here

1735
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:24,620
if I have to put screens on my windows?
Do you think that'll last? Will it change?

1736
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,870
I don't know.
Have you heard about this?

1737
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:31,010
Did you see that shit that I posted
yesterday about that yellow mustard plant?

1738
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:34,340
Yeah, black monster looks beautiful.
I was like, oh, that's nice.

1739
01:45:34,341 --> 01:45:38,150
And it was the most though. I'm at this
posting though. What's very strange man,

1740
01:45:38,151 --> 01:45:39,800
because this shit didn't exist before.

1741
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:44,950
Like I never saw like on the same hills
where I'm seeing it dominate the hill.

1742
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:50,090
It literally didn't exist a year ago and
now it's just like an invasive plant.

1743
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:52,040
It's crazy plant.

1744
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:55,370
I just looked up my skills in Los Angeles
and the thing starts an article from

1745
01:45:55,371 --> 01:45:56,720
the end of last year,
but it says,

1746
01:45:56,721 --> 01:46:00,080
have you experienced an unusual number
of mosquitoes bites the summer? Mostly,

1747
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:03,380
but no, excuse me. Mostly below the
knee and especially around your ankles.

1748
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,590
How about that?
It's a called an aid.

1749
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:10,610
It's called eighties and
the aids an aids bug.

1750
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:14,760
You have eighties 80 e d e s and
that's a real problem, right? Yeah,

1751
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,990
it's a problem. It's a real problem.
It says, what do I live in Spain?

1752
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:22,080
He just read it. E D e s and it's
a real problem. That's funny.

1753
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:24,330
Here's spreading like wildfire.
So Susan [inaudible],

1754
01:46:24,331 --> 01:46:27,710
director of scientific and technical
research services for the greater Los

1755
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:29,480
Angeles County Vector Control district.

1756
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:33,320
Sounds like Suzanne needs
money for fucking business.

1757
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:37,130
That's what sounds like to me. Or
our phones are exploding. Fake News.

1758
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:44,600
Kidding. Los Angeles is home
to two particularly troubling
types of invasive ADSL

1759
01:46:44,601 --> 01:46:46,310
mosquitoes. Oh man, they're going fast.

1760
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:50,910
The Asian Tiger mosquito arrived first
having hitched a ride with shipments of

1761
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:54,300
lucky bamboo from China.
You and your bamboo.

1762
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:59,550
I don't think my pole barbells
thing. It's like a polymer. China.

1763
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:04,551
In 2001 vector control
specialists monitored plant
nurseries across the county

1764
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,520
and soon stopped finding the
mosquitoes in their traps.

1765
01:47:08,521 --> 01:47:10,170
They thought the insects
had been eradicated.

1766
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:14,160
Whoever in 2011 residents in El Monte
began complaining about unusually

1767
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:17,840
aggressive daytime biting mosquitoes
plaguing the neighborhood. Yes.

1768
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:22,260
In the daytime.
Ms This is happening.

1769
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:24,630
They even a infiltrated.

1770
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:29,660
What do you think would happen if people
started seeing malaria in America?

1771
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:34,980
That can, why hasn't that
happened? Good question.

1772
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:39,120
I'm sure doctor Peter Hotez could have
explained that to us right when he was

1773
01:47:39,121 --> 01:47:40,800
talking about infectious diseases from

1774
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:46,800
malaria is a hilarious,
I know when I was still living in Ohio,

1775
01:47:46,801 --> 01:47:49,770
West Nile virus to pop up a lot
with mosquitoes. Do not like,

1776
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,120
not like every day or anything like that,

1777
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:53,550
but I know that had to spray certain
neighborhoods all the time like stay and

1778
01:47:53,551 --> 01:47:58,370
keep your kids and keep your pet.
Samara spraying your neighbor morale.

1779
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:01,080
I didn't sign up for this.
How about,

1780
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:05,490
how about signing up for spraying in the
West Nile because the spray is going to

1781
01:48:05,491 --> 01:48:08,250
get to everybody. They used to spray
when I was a kid in New Jersey,

1782
01:48:08,251 --> 01:48:11,350
they would spray for the Gypsy
moths, Jesus, they just come with,

1783
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:12,470
they wouldn't even tell us that.

1784
01:48:12,471 --> 01:48:15,750
It's just like look at that plane and
shit would be coming out of its ass end.

1785
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:20,010
Think of the difference between the way
a butterfly gets treated and a moth.

1786
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:22,230
Yeah.
Robots deserve it.

1787
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:29,170
Dirty. Isn't it funny? It's a little,

1788
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:32,220
they're a little chalky and
they have a plain color.

1789
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:35,580
We've got like that base around
their head and then the same thing,

1790
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:38,850
the other gray or white,
but it's only the way they look.

1791
01:48:38,910 --> 01:48:41,370
He had the butterflies
putable but isn't that crazy?

1792
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:46,110
Orange and black like we love them. Love
them. You find a spider, you stomp it.

1793
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:49,770
You would never go to a zoo and go into
the moth house. If you kill a lady bug,

1794
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:53,310
you're an asshole. Oh, completely. You're
a type of person who kills lady bugs.

1795
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:55,860
Yeah, but if you don't kill
Roach, I can't hang out with you.

1796
01:48:56,410 --> 01:49:00,640
If you let a roach run across the
kitchen floor and he likes hot nom roach,

1797
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:04,470
sadness, I save all.
Kill that fucking thing.

1798
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:09,480
You got to Roche in your kitchen lady.
But

1799
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:16,170
a lady has a couple dots on it. Why are
we racist with bugs? Because there's,

1800
01:49:16,171 --> 01:49:18,690
this has such a thing as beauty.
Okay.

1801
01:49:18,691 --> 01:49:23,100
That's why squirrels get a pass and
rats don't. Yes. Bushy tail. Yeah.

1802
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:27,240
Look in kill style like a fringe jacket
matches a tail was just because they

1803
01:49:27,241 --> 01:49:30,540
found that if the tails group bushy
people would stop killing them. Yeah.

1804
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:35,550
I mean what's more disgusting than just
a skin tail with nothing on it. Oh,

1805
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:39,120
awesome. Oh awesome. Tail possums.
Don't even cause any problems.

1806
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:43,480
See possum Taylor. Oh, you
little fucking Getcha Bat.

1807
01:49:43,570 --> 01:49:48,110
Little hands. Little hands
and your little tail. Oh,

1808
01:49:48,930 --> 01:49:52,090
beady eyes. Yeah. Disgusting. Yeah,

1809
01:49:52,091 --> 01:49:56,740
but like we have certain animals
that we like, like raccoons. Look,

1810
01:49:56,741 --> 01:49:59,360
we don't wreck like raccoons and they're
eating out of your garbage button. Now,

1811
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:02,500
if someone had a pet raccoon, you would
think that's the dopest thing ever.

1812
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:05,650
Can we have, we secretly
want relationships. Raccoons.

1813
01:50:05,651 --> 01:50:09,130
If they would only be nicer to us,
right? We would embrace raccoons.

1814
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:12,310
Raccoons don't want to have shit to do
with us. They don't. I don't get it.

1815
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,220
They're smart. Too smart
for us. We're nice to them.

1816
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:18,430
I thought these people are
assholes. Sweets, they go to
sleep and eat their trash.

1817
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:22,360
We'll just eat their garbage. Savory,
eat their garbage. They put lids on it.

1818
01:50:22,361 --> 01:50:25,300
That shit doesn't work. They've got
that cool black mass lift the lid.

1819
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:28,090
You throw it aside to pull the bag out.
They'll hands.

1820
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:31,180
I know if people hands they do
with a little tiny people. Hey,

1821
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:35,530
I know you can grab stuff. Smoke
cigarettes hanging out. Yeah, the text.

1822
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:39,920
They also wanna kill
chickens. Well, so do we.

1823
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:43,550
Do you know who's a real predator?
Skunks. Skunks are predators.

1824
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:47,780
There's a skunk living in the
back of my yard. Sprayed my dog.

1825
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:52,220
Oh No, it's still there.
I think so. Come on, Bro.

1826
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:55,850
Man Out. What am I going to do?
Take out the skunk hazmat suit.

1827
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:57,740
He'd begun time to go to war.

1828
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:02,420
I got to go crawl into the thing and
find them crawling to the thing. He goes,

1829
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:06,500
look, it is fucking shit's crazy.

1830
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:09,470
It's like he's flaunting.
He's like, yeah, look at that.

1831
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:12,500
His hand is so much smaller than his face.
It's crazy.

1832
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:15,560
Imagine if your hand was that small and
relationship to is the size of your head.

1833
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:20,710
He's adorable though, isn't he? He is cute
little fella. He's like, look at, look,

1834
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:23,710
you think I've stayed out of your garbage?
No Way. Look what I'm working with.

1835
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:26,050
Did they have opposable thumbs?
I'm working with,

1836
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:30,880
didn't quite seem like
five fingers with no thumb.

1837
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,580
Right. That's the thing. They never
figured out. Look at his teeth.

1838
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:37,120
They never figured it out.
Like they had meetings as hands dudes.

1839
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:41,590
We just need a thumb. Let
me see the teeth. There we
go. He's got his mouth open.

1840
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:46,320
That whoa, that would, that would
really hurt. Fucking suck. Look,

1841
01:51:46,321 --> 01:51:49,540
one of them is chipped. If, uh,
yeah, from biting you in the head.

1842
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:54,600
Do you think if a racker tattoo
you could fight it off? No.

1843
01:51:54,970 --> 01:51:58,360
Well you could stomp it.
What'd you do? What'd you give
up? It might cut your neck.

1844
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:03,450
When would you decide we're going to to
the death immediately. Immediately? Yeah.

1845
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:07,600
He wouldn't try to talk to raccoon out
of this. No. Soon as he makes a move.

1846
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:10,420
I'm ready because I've been
thinking about it since childhood.

1847
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:14,560
Oh look at that one. I don't want that one
bite my nose. Yeah, it was like a Hyena.

1848
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,210
The raccoon I made that thing.

1849
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:19,120
I've been thinking these things
are coming after us my whole life.

1850
01:52:19,121 --> 01:52:24,060
So if he makes a move, it's on, Bro.
Those teeth are God damn terrifying. Yes.

1851
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:27,370
Look at those teeth now. And
they're sneaky. That's a big thing.

1852
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:31,030
And they're filled with rabies
filled. Yeah, to the top.

1853
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:34,090
Like their balls are heavy with rates.
It's just oozing out of him

1854
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:40,510
to water balloons. Raccoons,
Swisher burning his is touch. Ooh,

1855
01:52:40,511 --> 01:52:42,730
I touch raccoons.

1856
01:52:42,731 --> 01:52:45,530
Rely on their hands more than
their eyes and going touch.

1857
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:50,210
You study suggested the sensitivity to
touch increases when their hands are wet,

1858
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:53,330
which might be why they
always wash their food. Why?

1859
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:56,510
I just washed my hands and now I am
going to touch you when you sleep.

1860
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:00,890
I ain't going to touch you and your
children while you were sleeping with my

1861
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,580
finger hands that give a rat was as
big as a raccoon and try to kill you.

1862
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:08,810
You'd be fucking terrified. No,
we'd be, we'd be spraying. Oh,

1863
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:12,200
if there were rats. Size things.
Just go on through La. Yeah.

1864
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:14,240
But why do you think we'll
spray for these mosquitoes?

1865
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:16,700
I think it's time to call our congressman.
Well,

1866
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:18,680
I think that everyone's
afraid of chem trails.

1867
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,800
And if you start sprang gs
circling greater Los Angeles
drop and poisoned down.

1868
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,980
That's the wrapped with the pizza.
I've seen that. Oh yeah, the pizza rat.

1869
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:31,940
That's he's famous. Rats are
disgusting too. They're pretty gross.

1870
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:36,140
You ever seen that Netflix
documentary on rats? No. Oh.

1871
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:40,260
Oh No. Really? Oh Dude. Really? Yeah.

1872
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:43,640
You need to watch it because it's um,
it's educational.

1873
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:46,160
It's not just gross and it's really gross.

1874
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:50,830
But when you realize how many of them
there really are in major cities. Yeah,

1875
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:55,340
the bio mass of them. It's
a fuck stunning. Really.

1876
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:58,700
All rat.
It's just rats.

1877
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,800
As many rat is more or somewhere in the
neighborhood of as many rats as there

1878
01:54:03,921 --> 01:54:05,210
are people really.

1879
01:54:05,211 --> 01:54:10,211
And there's 8 million people and there's
how many more as or more she's just,

1880
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:15,860
Oh, I mean you see them non stop
walking around and just guessing.

1881
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:18,260
Obviously most of them are subterranean.

1882
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:20,230
Most of them are living in
houses and most of them,

1883
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:23,690
I mean they burrow their way into tiny
little holes. How long does the rat live?

1884
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:27,230
It's good question. How long does
the rat live? Because they're born,

1885
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:27,921
there's a lot of them,

1886
01:54:27,921 --> 01:54:31,820
but do they stick around for like 20
years to the documentary showed how they

1887
01:54:31,821 --> 01:54:35,570
send young rats to try
out poison. Really? Yeah.

1888
01:54:35,571 --> 01:54:38,960
The old suicide rats, they send them out
there cause they don't know any better.

1889
01:54:38,990 --> 01:54:43,850
They let them die. They're just assholes.
Wow. Yeah. They, here's a little tip,

1890
01:54:43,851 --> 01:54:47,330
if they're ever doing construction
in New York in front of a restaurant,

1891
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:50,090
you don't need it. You don't
need on that street. Why?

1892
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:51,680
Because they're digging it up.

1893
01:54:51,681 --> 01:54:55,550
Whatever their little ecosystem
is and they're just so,

1894
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:58,100
if they're digging up the street,
they're dying somewhere else.

1895
01:54:58,130 --> 01:55:01,520
I would imagine in New York, it must be
so hard to keep them out of a restaurant.

1896
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:06,080
Oh, it's gotta be so hard. I guess maybe
leave some in the dumpster for him.

1897
01:55:06,081 --> 01:55:09,500
Like he'd give a lego
monsters. Just the head. Yeah.

1898
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:13,250
Like when they was to tie the
girl into the stakes for Kong.

1899
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:17,930
So you'd leave everybody else alone
and a little shish Kebab stick.

1900
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:23,520
It's like your last job when you're
closing down the restaurant, the gates,

1901
01:55:24,990 --> 01:55:28,670
the rats are our friends put the
skulls out. Well, what is interesting?

1902
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:31,730
What are those various sizes of them?

1903
01:55:31,731 --> 01:55:35,890
They'd go up to about two pounds
in New York City to have a,

1904
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:38,780
he doesn't think there's any that are
three because they'd be too big to be able

1905
01:55:38,781 --> 01:55:43,410
to move around physiological
limit to their size. Does
it say how long they live?

1906
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:46,800
Average? About two years. One to
two years in the wild, up to four.

1907
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:49,440
If you have it as a pet.
A wow. That's it. Yeah.

1908
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:54,360
My wife had hamsters alert that my wife
had rats for pets when she was a kid.

1909
01:55:54,630 --> 01:55:56,100
Was she golf now?

1910
01:55:56,130 --> 01:56:00,240
She was just like Jersey kid just loved
animals and she would just ride her bike

1911
01:56:00,241 --> 01:56:03,330
around in this rat would just be
like on her shoulder. Jesus Christ.

1912
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:08,160
We're grat lady. Weird. Yeah.
Yeah. I get it. What it was,

1913
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:11,940
but she said they were super smart and
super affectionate. Yeah. If you had it,

1914
01:56:11,941 --> 01:56:15,150
it's a whole life and you raise it right?
Yeah. Why not? Yeah. It's not dirty.

1915
01:56:15,151 --> 01:56:18,480
It's not like going through the sewers
and Eaton Poo and climate on your hand.

1916
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:21,090
Right.
But it would have just let it go.

1917
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:26,220
Maybe 100% she like had
it out with her go rat.

1918
01:56:26,221 --> 01:56:29,670
Like if you just let it let it loose in
the wild, how long would it take for?

1919
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:34,820
How long would it take for a domesticated
rat to adapt to living in like a New

1920
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:41,390
York City sewer? 40 seconds.
What do you think they were?

1921
01:56:41,391 --> 01:56:46,260
Do they just get their crazy fucking
Disney may look at you from the suburbs

1922
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:48,490
where he'd been living in
a house? Yeah, with like,

1923
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:50,560
you know those are the multi colored rats.

1924
01:56:50,561 --> 01:56:52,930
They have like all these little
different colors on them. Oh,

1925
01:56:52,931 --> 01:56:56,870
you so clean with your pink
hair. Different colors. Look,

1926
01:56:57,970 --> 01:57:02,620
hey Joe, get a load of this
one. He's not even Greg. Hey,

1927
01:57:02,621 --> 01:57:06,730
how come you ain't Greg? Look
at Julia White. You're brown.

1928
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:11,950
You're like a fucking dog
over there. Thank you. Better
than us, don't ya? Yeah. Hey,

1929
01:57:11,951 --> 01:57:14,950
get over here. I guess you don't
know how to get into the restaurant.

1930
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:20,770
What do you got money on you?
You give us some money,

1931
01:57:20,771 --> 01:57:24,730
we'll show you where you
get all the good food. Yeah.

1932
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:29,630
You ever been a little Italy?
We till the show yet. What up?

1933
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:34,410
It's a shore dives. Getting born
a rap. Being born or at oh. Oh,

1934
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:39,080
the worst. Terrible. Nobody likes you.
No one likes you, but you will. I have a,

1935
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:42,270
you do survive pretty well. You'd
be better off being a hab. Alina.

1936
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:47,640
What's a half Alina? It's a
peccary. What's a peccary?
It's like a cousin to a pig.

1937
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:48,623
What's a pig

1938
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:55,550
you ever see that lead Doug lives? You
know Doug lives in Bisbee, Arizona.

1939
01:57:55,560 --> 01:58:00,360
Stan hope. Um, oh, by the
way, I think it's so, it's
sold out, but he's taping his,

1940
01:58:00,361 --> 01:58:04,380
uh, his next special in Vegas
next month. Oh, nice. Yeah.

1941
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:09,020
In Vegas. That's cool. Where he lives in
Bisbee like he basically, that's Avalina.

1942
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:11,600
He lives really close to the border.
Like I think he's the only,

1943
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:15,690
like six miles from the border
or some crazy shit. Um, and um,

1944
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:18,570
these things live in the wild,
out in the desert, right?

1945
01:58:18,571 --> 01:58:23,310
Fucking there are aggressive and
they fucked up his neighbor's dog.

1946
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:25,760
They killed his neighbor's dog. Yeah, man,

1947
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,420
the dog was out and the Havoline is will
flank it looked to get on both sides of

1948
01:58:30,421 --> 01:58:32,670
it and they, they uh,
like in a pack. Yeah.

1949
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,730
They hunt in the pack and
they will attack a small dog

1950
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:40,710
that thinks disgusting. Gross.
That's, that's like a giant rat.

1951
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:45,520
It looks like a giant rat. Well, it
does look so it looks like a pig.

1952
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:48,250
Fucked her raw. Somebody shot
in the face. Oh, crossbow.

1953
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:52,130
People hunt them all the time. It
looks like a pig. Fucked a rat. I see.

1954
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:55,840
That got shot. One doesn't go get pink.
Fucked around, right? It does. Yeah.

1955
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:59,860
Click on the guy who shot
one. Yeah. Bow and Arrow.

1956
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:02,540
A lot of guys a hunt down
with archery equipment. See,

1957
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,950
wouldn't it be better if he was
dressed in like a doe coat with a tie?

1958
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:09,760
None of those boots. You don't want
that thing to see you look at that.

1959
01:59:09,761 --> 01:59:13,040
That's a rat face
picture.

1960
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:18,670
Giant body screw. Scroll back to that
last one and make it bigger. Yeah. Yeah.

1961
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:20,770
Bra.
That guys hunting rats.

1962
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:26,110
That's like a slightly
different looking rat. Oh,

1963
01:59:26,111 --> 01:59:30,040
you want to know what's really
crazy? Giant rat. That's
a hundred pound rat. Yeah.

1964
01:59:30,190 --> 01:59:31,750
Without a tail.
It's so gross.

1965
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:36,280
And you know what's really crazy
is those were animals. Um, they'll,

1966
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:41,170
they're the best animal to a call now.
What a call is,

1967
01:59:41,171 --> 01:59:46,120
is like you'd made up make a sound of
a wounded animal. No, you make like,

1968
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:51,970
like something that's stopped suffering.
Look like people take their hand,

1969
01:59:56,650 --> 02:00:01,030
these fuckers run in,
they run in gas,

1970
02:00:01,031 --> 02:00:04,990
they're so aggressive. It's
crazy to watch. Something's
hurting. I can go eat it.

1971
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:05,380
They,

1972
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:08,200
but they have to act quick because there's
coyotes out there and mountain lions

1973
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:11,110
out there. So when something's
hurting you're like fuck food.

1974
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:14,740
And they just run towards it.
So when your bow hunting,

1975
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:19,330
you almost have to have one person make
the call and you're at full draw and

1976
02:00:19,331 --> 02:00:22,630
then they start calling and the things
come running in and you shoot at him.

1977
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:25,270
Yeah.
Cause you couldn't do it.

1978
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:28,210
You couldn't get to the boat for a long
time because they'd see you and they go

1979
02:00:28,211 --> 02:00:31,990
fuck it. The guy took off
the other way again. Yeah.

1980
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:36,760
Are these like invasive where they all
over his property? No, they're natural.

1981
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:38,440
They're there,
but I mean are they not invasive?

1982
02:00:38,441 --> 02:00:43,140
But I mean these are a lot of them. Yes.
There's like a ton of where exists. Yeah.

1983
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:44,710
I mean they exist in the desert.
I mean,

1984
02:00:44,711 --> 02:00:48,510
they exist in healthy enough populations
that you, people hunt for them. Wow.

1985
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:53,560
And they eat them. They say it takes you.
Yeah. It was neat that you eed to pig.

1986
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:58,750
Yeah, but they're cuter. Wild boar.
Yeah. Crazy tusks looking. Yeah,

1987
02:00:58,751 --> 02:01:02,260
those are gross too. Pretty
gross to my pigs. My kings.

1988
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,630
I believe those are the ones I have.

1989
02:01:04,631 --> 02:01:07,750
Bow ties climbing around this
guy's garage and little tap shoes.

1990
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:12,620
Sometimes I had do this shit
down, Bro. They're standing.

1991
02:01:12,621 --> 02:01:15,520
I'm down there in his garage.
There's a whole bunch of 'em. Fuck.

1992
02:01:15,521 --> 02:01:18,180
Is that all right on your kid's toy?
Look at is.

1993
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:21,720
It's all it's hair's up is running way.
Look at that.

1994
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:23,830
Just going to take a
dump in your driveway.

1995
02:01:23,831 --> 02:01:26,890
Who'd you do not want that in your life?
I don't want to live there.

1996
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:31,780
This fucking 20 of them in this guy's
driveway. See that one there and the back.

1997
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:34,960
How many do you roll that back again?
How many were there?

1998
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:37,570
There was like 12 what is
the name of that video for?

1999
02:01:37,571 --> 02:01:41,960
People want to watch it wild. Have
Aleena's make a visit to Arizona home.

2000
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:45,980
Why? No, no, no. I know
you can't show it though.

2001
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,320
Those fucking things are everywhere.

2002
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:53,680
There's a lot of them we feel while
many of them there are at least at least

2003
02:01:54,111 --> 02:01:57,800
eight. And then there's the one that
was on top of the, there's nine.

2004
02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:59,330
And then there's the one
that was on top of the truck.

2005
02:01:59,331 --> 02:02:01,780
And that is one that you could
see through the fence. Yeah.

2006
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:05,000
And there's probably more out there too.
It was gone in the car.

2007
02:02:05,001 --> 02:02:07,430
It's going into the kids.
A little car. Jesus Christ.

2008
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:12,470
It's in the passenger seat of the car.
Gross.

2009
02:02:12,650 --> 02:02:16,910
Fucking creepy. Like wild. Have Alina is
like a Dean Martin Song. Do you think so?

2010
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:21,320
Look at all over there.
Look at, Oh fuck man.

2011
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:25,220
They're weird looking too.
They look like they're demons.

2012
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:28,340
I don't like them at all. A little
beady eyes like they're up to. No. Good,

2013
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:31,820
but if he was a little kid,
you thinking like,

2014
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:36,980
I wouldn't live there because
that's there. But if you
live in New York at night,

2015
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:38,660
who knows what's climbing all around?

2016
02:02:38,661 --> 02:02:43,580
Your building could be eagles and shit.
Right? Is that what you talking about?

2017
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:45,380
No.
Google.

2018
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:50,480
I get into my house and a
Google Havoline it eats baby.

2019
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:54,290
Let's see if that's ever
happened. Yeah. Human Baby.

2020
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:59,300
Let's see if that happened. What do you
think if I have a of eight a human? Yeah,

2021
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:01,870
like she, those fucking things.
20 in that guy's drought.

2022
02:03:01,871 --> 02:03:03,560
They definitely eaten babies.
I'm exaggerating.

2023
02:03:03,561 --> 02:03:05,450
It wasn't 20 someone's
eating the baby right now.

2024
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:10,030
Probably 13 it was probably 12 Baker's
dozen. A Baker's dozen of heaviness.

2025
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,480
Yeah. They would eat a baby. A
toddler. Yeah. Knock it down. Yeah.

2026
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:18,410
I mean if they eat a dog, yeah,
they're scared of people. Obviously.

2027
02:03:18,411 --> 02:03:19,340
We weren't scared of that dude.

2028
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:21,890
Now that's a full brown person
and the baby doesn't end.

2029
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:26,750
It doesn't have anything. I know. I put
his hair up, spikes up to let you know.

2030
02:03:26,751 --> 02:03:31,670
It's threatened to ever tell you the
story. When I pulled a rabbit out of my,

2031
02:03:31,671 --> 02:03:35,250
uh, pull vacuum. Yeah.

2032
02:03:37,150 --> 02:03:40,640
Was it alive? No. Did Stink.

2033
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:44,960
It had it stunk. I'm like, why isn't the
vacuum working? Did you think about it?

2034
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:49,520
I dove in and I pulled it up
and there was a half a rat.

2035
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:51,440
It's ass sticking out the vacuum.

2036
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:55,880
And as soon as I got it
above the water flies, just

2037
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:00,590
pull it out without it.
There's a quest. She king.

2038
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:04,010
Where the fuck are the flies
before the shit? Good question.

2039
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:08,540
Where the fuck are they all over
there? Not that many. Like if you,

2040
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:13,370
if you are around by a person's
backyard. Yeah. How often he's,

2041
02:04:13,371 --> 02:04:16,430
he flies every now and then there's one,
it's kind of annoying,

2042
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:18,740
but if you just pulled your pants down,
shat on the ground,

2043
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:22,400
it would be flies on that
within a matter of moments. Oh,

2044
02:04:22,401 --> 02:04:26,750
you mean right after I swam, you swam
the shaft right on their law. I mean,

2045
02:04:26,751 --> 02:04:30,130
you're after swim shit. Yeah. And then
all of a sudden they show up. Yeah.

2046
02:04:30,131 --> 02:04:33,410
It's disgusting. It
happened so fast. So gross.

2047
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:37,680
All of a sudden they're all like,
yeah, like where'd you guys come from?

2048
02:04:37,681 --> 02:04:39,630
We should just stay inside a little.

2049
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:44,730
Did you find a baby death from of have
Alina a couple of months ago. It's not.

2050
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:47,910
A couple people in Arizona were attacked
and they had like old woman was bit

2051
02:04:47,911 --> 02:04:50,580
while she was walking her dogs and other
guy was bit while he was feeding them

2052
02:04:50,581 --> 02:04:52,360
and he didn't feed it fast
enough and it bit them.

2053
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:55,980
That's about as much sacrifice.
Well the lady who got bit,

2054
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:59,520
that's the scary one because the
guy who fed them as an asshole.

2055
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:02,360
Right. This Gary one. That's it.

2056
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:06,810
There was a lady got bit by
a coyote recently in Dallas
though. Yeah, no, no. Yeah,

2057
02:05:06,811 --> 02:05:07,860
it was around the Dallas area.

2058
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:11,040
I think they think that there's just
one coyote that's been biting people.

2059
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:15,570
It's a rogue,
unusual coyote snapping at people.

2060
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:19,920
Yeah. They had bite marks on their
legs. Oh my God, that's gross man.

2061
02:05:19,921 --> 02:05:23,400
Cause they will kill you. They
would kill you. They're just small.

2062
02:05:23,401 --> 02:05:27,840
They're just not sure if it's worth
the effort and you're around people and

2063
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:31,050
they're worried that you know.
One on one cause you fight off a coyote.

2064
02:05:31,051 --> 02:05:33,870
I don't know if you could then, I mean I
think you probably could if you had to,

2065
02:05:33,871 --> 02:05:37,320
but they'll fuck you up man. Just
keep buying it. There's a few of them.

2066
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:40,660
That's where the real problem comes. If
they bite you in the right spot. Yeah man,

2067
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:43,020
the rip your tendons apart.
You won't be able to run away.

2068
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:46,880
They know what they're doing to, you know,
they know what they're doing. It though.

2069
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:49,530
Did try to take your legs out.
I mean they know what they're doing.

2070
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,600
They're not going to try to jump
up and bite you in the neck.

2071
02:05:51,810 --> 02:05:52,800
They're going to try to take your,

2072
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:56,370
your hamstrings out trying to rip
your legs apart so you can't run.

2073
02:05:56,700 --> 02:05:59,010
Why are they so mean?
That's how they're alive.

2074
02:06:00,150 --> 02:06:02,750
You're not leaving any food
out for them or you know,

2075
02:06:02,751 --> 02:06:05,100
you've got to do what they gotta do.
It's called domestication.

2076
02:06:05,101 --> 02:06:09,330
That's how we have dogs. Do you ever take
your family camping? I have not. Yeah.

2077
02:06:09,331 --> 02:06:10,860
I haven't either.
I would though.

2078
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:16,730
I wanted to take my kids to Yosemite cause
I love Yosemite to bring a peace sign

2079
02:06:17,191 --> 02:06:19,440
arm.
Nothing just went solo.

2080
02:06:19,470 --> 02:06:22,560
We weren't camping and we were staying
in it and we were staying in an end.

2081
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:27,420
What about emergency food?
No morale. Iphone, nothing.
Just a phone. First Aid kit.

2082
02:06:27,650 --> 02:06:32,400
Nothing.
Bag of Funyuns and an iPhone.

2083
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:33,540
So I need,

2084
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:36,840
and I want to show them you'll 70 cause
it's such a great part of my life.

2085
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:40,080
I love it. I've been living in the
back country for like a week at a time.

2086
02:06:40,081 --> 02:06:44,100
I just love the whole thing and I telling
them about it and I'm building it up.

2087
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:48,390
They would be like, you know, but
grudgingly going. They're all vegetarians.

2088
02:06:48,391 --> 02:06:50,670
They just love nature. They
just love whatever. So I'm like,

2089
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:55,470
you're going to love Yosemite is as we
drove into the park, welcome to Yosemite.

2090
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:57,090
I ran over a squirrel.

2091
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:04,980
The horror inside the car.
Dad, you didn't even slow down.

2092
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:09,150
What's wrong? You're a monster.
I'm like I can't. It's two lanes.

2093
02:07:09,151 --> 02:07:13,440
There's a guy behind me, a guy front.
I just would steamroll the squirrel.

2094
02:07:13,860 --> 02:07:18,510
They were so they were in
the whole weekend. Anytime.
I'd be like, look at this.

2095
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:21,660
Look at this beautiful view.
You killed a squirrel.

2096
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:26,850
You didn't even care. That's the weird
part. Dang. You didn't even care.

2097
02:07:27,090 --> 02:07:30,120
Is that what they're saying?
Yeah, we were supposed to cry.

2098
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:34,190
I was just laughing like a bitch.
Yeah, exactly. That's what he did.

2099
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:38,350
He killed a or you'd be sadder, right?
Right. Yeah. Well I can't, damn,

2100
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:42,030
I can't believe that
she is.

2101
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:46,810
She was so nice to their little eyes and
little tail, but it's square a peccary.

2102
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:51,820
Yeah. If you can't win them Havalinas
like he's fucking rat thing. Fine.

2103
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:55,540
It's mom that have Avalina would ruin
your, that punch to bite your teeth.

2104
02:07:55,730 --> 02:07:58,120
He'd probably use it's t
to tear your tires apart.

2105
02:07:58,910 --> 02:08:01,300
Then you be stuck in the side of
the road trying to change a tire.

2106
02:08:01,301 --> 02:08:04,180
You turn around, there's a whole
pack of them closing in on you.

2107
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,610
Would you not take your
family because of all of this?

2108
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:10,360
Do you not want them
in the woods with you?

2109
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:13,740
What am I a danger in the woods or
become a werewolf? What the fuck?

2110
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:19,960
He just got to stay tonight.
Trust me. I'll be right back.

2111
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:22,310
Not that you're the threat,
Ron,

2112
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:25,870
that you'd have to protect them
from all the threats. Well,

2113
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:30,900
I mean Yosemite doesn't have that
many threats other than people bears.

2114
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:34,600
They have black bears then.
Yeah.

2115
02:08:34,601 --> 02:08:37,000
Most of Mountain Lion
Mountain lions are an issue.

2116
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:42,210
There's always something out there.
Yeah. Grizzly bears or you're just for,

2117
02:08:42,211 --> 02:08:45,100
you just don't feel like that's a cause.
You like going out into nature,

2118
02:08:45,101 --> 02:08:48,460
you go do all that stuff. I do like one
of the nature also, like being indoors,

2119
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:52,180
like sleeping in a place
where it's awesome to sleep.

2120
02:08:52,630 --> 02:08:57,610
People wiser than me if figured it out
that that maneuver is called a bed with a

2121
02:08:57,611 --> 02:09:02,200
roof and a locked door and a refrigerator.
You fucking cave person.

2122
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,590
Oh, I'm going to rough it. I'm gonna
Sleep on the ground. You don't have to,

2123
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:09,490
you know that I can sleep in a house.
Yeah, but when you go hunting and stuff,

2124
02:09:09,491 --> 02:09:12,790
don't you sleep in the woods sometimes?
Most of the time, no. I'm going to have,

2125
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:15,970
oh you don't. You go back to
[inaudible]. What? What guys I go with.

2126
02:09:16,750 --> 02:09:18,040
Go with Steve Rinella.

2127
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:22,660
We always almost always go camping
except for one were at our friend Doug

2128
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:23,940
Durrance place,
which is a,

2129
02:09:24,010 --> 02:09:29,010
he lives in Wisconsin and he's got a
giant farm and we hunt deer on a hundred

2130
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:32,980
year on there. And uh, that
place he's got a cool little,

2131
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:38,020
little like a deer hunting house.
Oh yeah, that's near the s yeah,

2132
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:42,730
like a cabin. It looks like a house. It's
like a house, a small house at everybody.

2133
02:09:42,731 --> 02:09:47,140
A look. Hangs out in different spots
there. Yeah. Right, right, right.

2134
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:50,440
I'd like to take my kids camping.

2135
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:53,770
There's something nice about sleeping
in the woods and shorter in nature.

2136
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:57,970
You know what else is cool?
Not getting eaten. Hbo

2137
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:04,810
Take a shower in the morning.
That's nice. Yeah. You got go stove,

2138
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:07,880
coffee. That's the big thing.
Yeah. Yeah. Look, I put up,

2139
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:10,930
there's nothing better than a campfire.
I now hanging out,

2140
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:16,950
especially at the end of a long day of
hiking, and then you've got a campfire,

2141
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,110
and if you get one of those little grates
over the campfire, you start cooking,

2142
02:10:20,111 --> 02:10:23,530
Cook over the campfire. That's
the bass, the best things in life.

2143
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:27,140
I know and I feel like my kids
don't have that connection cause uh,

2144
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:30,640
do you worry about being with them
in the woods? Yeah, a little bit.

2145
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:34,610
If anybody gets hurt, it's hard to get
out. Yeah. And just that, you know,

2146
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:38,510
it's like if you and I went, we're both
responsible for, we'd help each other out,

2147
02:10:38,511 --> 02:10:40,700
but I'm going to leave. Get your act
together. What? I'm going to leave you.

2148
02:10:40,701 --> 02:10:44,630
I'm sorry. What? I'm going to leave you
say that again. Yeah. I just, I can't,

2149
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:51,880
I cannot tell you guys
planning a camping trip like,

2150
02:10:52,221 --> 02:10:54,590
hey, we're going to look out for each
other. I'm going to leave you behind.

2151
02:10:55,070 --> 02:10:57,770
I'll tell you right now, it looks you
on my leg camera with you, but I'm not,

2152
02:10:57,860 --> 02:11:02,510
I can't handle any adversity. I
will fall apart. Please don't.

2153
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:05,510
Where are you going?
And we're not going in too far.

2154
02:11:06,070 --> 02:11:11,070
I will walk one mile when the
alarm goes off at one mile camp.

2155
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:16,430
Dude, seriously, you're
not going to help me out.

2156
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:22,210
I'll call somebody when I get there.
He's back there or mile. I don't know,

2157
02:11:22,230 --> 02:11:25,880
something like a mile.
Just follow the blood.

2158
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:31,100
He's got a backpack full of Slim Jim's.
It'd be all right. It'll be good.

2159
02:11:31,101 --> 02:11:35,880
He's got enough food on. Well, I
left him one liter of my pis. Uh,

2160
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:39,290
he can drink that.
Just got his leg where I peed.

2161
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:44,750
Horrible camping and commanding.
I got good news and bad news.

2162
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:48,830
The bad news is I don't have any water.
The good news is I have to pee.

2163
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:52,790
So what do you want to do it one day?

2164
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:58,050
I mean to fill up your Nalgene
bottle. Oh, awful to know. But you're,

2165
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:59,600
but if you go with your
kids and you're like,

2166
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:02,930
you're responsible for everybody and
everything and yeah, it's pretty, yeah,

2167
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:05,060
maybe just a hike.
Well,

2168
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:07,830
there's nothing wrong with camp when
the kids a good idea. Just, you know,

2169
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:10,460
you should,
if you really aren't going to go camping,

2170
02:12:10,461 --> 02:12:13,460
you definitely should bring first aid
and definitely brings a satellite phone

2171
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:18,290
and you can camp in places that, you
know, you're not back country a mile in.

2172
02:12:18,291 --> 02:12:19,520
You could just, you know, pull up,

2173
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:23,300
walk 200 feet off a fucking airstream son.

2174
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:25,610
Pull that bitch behind park.

2175
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:30,310
Turn the generator on satellite TV.
Yeah,

2176
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:34,610
that would be fun. Stores.
You can rent those and just

2177
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,560
talk to her.
Yelling out the window.

2178
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:44,150
Making friends.

2179
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:52,970
I think uh, I would like to like load
them up in a RV kind of situation.

2180
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,950
Go see the Grand Canyon. Go through
Utah. Like Chevy Chase. Yeah. Yeah.

2181
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:00,020
I think that we're going to be fun.

2182
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:04,400
Two more people just died in the
Grand Canyon. What fell? Yeah. Really?

2183
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:08,270
Why they're not just reading the railings?
I don't know.

2184
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:09,230
I don't know what happened.

2185
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:13,550
I just read two more people just fell to
their death in the Grand Canyon. Really?

2186
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:16,060
Let's see. If you find out
what's going on, why are people,

2187
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:19,250
that was one of the first hikes I did
with my father. We do in the switchbacks.

2188
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,120
What'd you say, Jim? If
there's a reason why I say,

2189
02:13:21,121 --> 02:13:26,090
well I'm a guy who's got too close and
slipped and I need to know what I slipped

2190
02:13:26,091 --> 02:13:28,790
off the stop falling. If I had
Google glass, I didn't know.

2191
02:13:28,791 --> 02:13:31,040
And already if I had that memory link

2192
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:34,650
wire thing that Jamie's worried about,

2193
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,010
Jamie's going to be the
first one to get it.

2194
02:13:36,011 --> 02:13:38,310
Then he's going to like organize to
make sure that no one else gets it.

2195
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:39,450
My thought on that too was like,

2196
02:13:39,451 --> 02:13:42,660
who is going to be the first one
to get it and how you decide that?

2197
02:13:43,490 --> 02:13:45,420
Well for sure like money,

2198
02:13:45,870 --> 02:13:48,990
Marcus Brownley and
Lou from unbox therapy,

2199
02:13:48,991 --> 02:13:51,720
they'll get it first and they'll put it
on and then they'll start running the

2200
02:13:51,721 --> 02:13:55,170
world and they go, ah, no
one else gets this dope.

2201
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:59,880
But Mark Zuckerberg probably already
has it. You don't want to it right now.

2202
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:01,800
Fend his case.

2203
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:10,980
Yeah. It's um, it's coming. Something's
coming. Yeah, man. What's it gonna be?

2204
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:12,960
Who knows what's going to be,

2205
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:15,960
something's coming and something's going
to be more invasive than what we're

2206
02:14:15,961 --> 02:14:18,420
experiencing now,
so I can be sure of.

2207
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:21,060
They're going to figure how to
get more and more data. You know,

2208
02:14:21,061 --> 02:14:24,060
Sam Harris has a really
interesting podcast. It's out.

2209
02:14:24,061 --> 02:14:26,790
It's either the one that's going on,
right?

2210
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:31,710
Maybe the two weeks ago. And it was
all about, I should probably find it.

2211
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:35,220
It was all about um,
privacy,

2212
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:39,840
privacy and what's the difference between
the way a different tech companies

2213
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:44,580
approach privacy and actually it makes
you respect how apple does it. Oh yeah,

2214
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:49,100
yeah. I mean they apparently
they do it much more. Um,

2215
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:52,350
I guess the word would be
there more ethical about it.

2216
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:57,480
They're trying not to give away any
trouble with Facebook is what it's called.

2217
02:14:58,090 --> 02:14:59,620
I was reading a thing
yesterday that you know,

2218
02:14:59,621 --> 02:15:03,100
you put those a doorbell things on,
you know like ring,

2219
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:07,570
you know the records, people coming
up to you and they said, you know,

2220
02:15:07,970 --> 02:15:12,310
you think it's cool for you and your
family but the ups guy or all these

2221
02:15:12,311 --> 02:15:16,900
delivery people that are getting their
picture taken and sent to a database

2222
02:15:16,901 --> 02:15:20,470
every day, right? Like these people
are being monitored all the time.

2223
02:15:20,471 --> 02:15:22,030
So while it's good for you,

2224
02:15:22,031 --> 02:15:24,550
it's not that great for these
other people that visit you.

2225
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:28,320
This guy's name is Roger Mcnamee. That's
the one, it's the trouble of Facebook.

2226
02:15:28,321 --> 02:15:31,750
It's episode one 52. It's really,
it's very interesting cause the,

2227
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:37,620
what what goes into is about how tech
companies figured out how to tap into a

2228
02:15:39,571 --> 02:15:41,490
resource that no one thought of.

2229
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,610
And that resource is your data
and how much is that worth? Well,

2230
02:15:44,611 --> 02:15:47,280
it turns out it's worth
fucking untold billions.

2231
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:51,240
It's one of the most valuable things
cause it you can direct market to people.

2232
02:15:51,241 --> 02:15:54,390
You could find out what people are
in tune with or not and to you get,

2233
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:56,220
you get a lot of people
that you can get ahold of.

2234
02:15:56,670 --> 02:16:01,640
And we kind of gave our consent to
this without understanding it. Yeah.

2235
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:06,570
And they got in through a loophole
and this is how they're able to make,

2236
02:16:06,730 --> 02:16:08,280
you know,
ungodly amounts of money

2237
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:12,550
just because we wanted to have that cool
feature. So you just say, yeah, here's,

2238
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:13,370
take it from me.

2239
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:14,900
Maybe thinking about the amount of money,

2240
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:18,590
something like Facebook brings in
versus what it is. Like what is it?

2241
02:16:18,620 --> 02:16:20,450
What are you doing? What are you
doing this making all that money.

2242
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,410
They're providing people with data,
you know,

2243
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:27,770
and they're also getting people to the,
it's like a,

2244
02:16:27,771 --> 02:16:32,771
an ongoing psychological experiment
in what makes people engage.

2245
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:39,010
Like what makes people comment more?
Turns out it's anger. Oh really? Yeah.

2246
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:43,450
It turns out that what makes people
engaged the most is things they disagree

2247
02:16:43,451 --> 02:16:47,200
with when they started having fights,
fights back and forth.

2248
02:16:47,201 --> 02:16:52,201
So you get people to get really
into these polarizing subject,

2249
02:16:52,271 --> 02:16:56,050
right? And then you, once they
start looking for those subjects,

2250
02:16:56,051 --> 02:16:59,260
then they'll subject starts showing up
in their feet since all sorts of things

2251
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:01,720
that they get angry about. So then they
started interacting with these things.

2252
02:17:01,721 --> 02:17:06,450
The more you interact, the more more it
shows up in your feed and all the wild,

2253
02:17:06,451 --> 02:17:10,570
they're profiting on enraging you.
I'm like God,

2254
02:17:10,571 --> 02:17:12,070
I mean this is essentially what they do.

2255
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:17,100
She creepy Facebook patent uses image
recognition to scan your personal photos

2256
02:17:17,501 --> 02:17:19,420
for brands.
Oh my God.

2257
02:17:20,550 --> 02:17:24,570
Yeah. So they just take all your photos
and I'll collect dorito bags in the back.

2258
02:17:25,010 --> 02:17:29,470
Applying computer vision algorithms
to user uploaded multimedia objects to

2259
02:17:29,471 --> 02:17:34,471
detect specific objects
within the multimedia object
and promoting the uploaded

2260
02:17:34,881 --> 02:17:39,881
multimedia object from a user's news
feed to a sponsored stories area.

2261
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:45,310
That's what the patent
was awarded for. Ah, Jeez.

2262
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:49,760
A little vision content
detection for sponsored stories.

2263
02:17:50,060 --> 02:17:50,893
Wow,

2264
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:53,060
that's crazy man.
Yeah.

2265
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:57,350
You snap a selfie sipping a Unicorn
frappe at Starbucks and then shares that

2266
02:17:57,351 --> 02:18:00,560
selfie on Facebook or Instagram.

2267
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:04,280
Facebook's newly patented technology
can theoretically scan the photo,

2268
02:18:04,281 --> 02:18:08,630
spot the Starbucks cup with the help of
an image object recognition algorithm

2269
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:11,510
and then sell that info to Starbucks.

2270
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:14,990
Alerting the coffee giant of the
fact that you like it's product.

2271
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:15,921
Well,

2272
02:18:15,921 --> 02:18:20,510
they're already doing a version of that
with your search things you're looking

2273
02:18:20,511 --> 02:18:23,240
at. You know when you go through their
browser, they're already doing that.

2274
02:18:23,310 --> 02:18:24,990
Well,
they're doing it also with voice.

2275
02:18:25,350 --> 02:18:29,880
Your phone is listening to you all the
time. If you have Alexa in your home,

2276
02:18:29,881 --> 02:18:32,880
it's listening. My kids and
when we, we do it all the time,

2277
02:18:32,881 --> 02:18:35,610
like if you're talking about something
and then all of a sudden you see,

2278
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:40,080
I was performing in Boise and so we
were talking about Boise, Boise, Boise,

2279
02:18:40,081 --> 02:18:44,610
and then everybody on their Instagram
was getting an ad for vacationing and

2280
02:18:44,611 --> 02:18:47,430
Boise. See, that seems
gesture must speaking it.

2281
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,750
That seems like a really serious thing.
It is.

2282
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:54,210
It seems like a really serious thing
that everybody is just like, oh,

2283
02:18:54,211 --> 02:18:56,640
this is happening. Yeah. I
remember signing off on this.

2284
02:18:56,641 --> 02:19:00,590
The technology is ahead of our anger
or our recognition of it. Yeah.

2285
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:02,290
We don't understand.
Yeah.

2286
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:05,220
It's already happened by the
time you're upset that it

2287
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:09,520
exists, right? Yeah. It's, it's in
full full force right now. Yeah.

2288
02:19:10,350 --> 02:19:14,100
Yeah. It's really weird. It's really
weird. It's really weird. I mean,

2289
02:19:14,101 --> 02:19:18,900
we're just talking about it. This is just,
we think it's, you're just in your home.

2290
02:19:18,901 --> 02:19:23,100
You were in a private place, but these
phones that are just listening, you know,

2291
02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:28,340
and again, this is something that
didn't exist 10 ago, 15 years ago.

2292
02:19:28,730 --> 02:19:32,750
Did these concerns didn't exist. What
would be the concerns 15 years from now?

2293
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:36,770
Look how much more invasive as is going
to get before we even recognize that

2294
02:19:36,771 --> 02:19:39,520
it's happening. Because this
is, this is something, the, the,

2295
02:19:39,521 --> 02:19:42,650
the listening in on things is something
that people didn't think about before it

2296
02:19:42,651 --> 02:19:45,860
happened. Now they know it does. Well,

2297
02:19:45,861 --> 02:19:50,660
the face recognition thing is there's a
lot of articles on that and how that we

2298
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:53,150
don't realize, well, they're trying
to think. Totally makes sense. Right.

2299
02:19:53,151 --> 02:19:57,490
Especially with so many people's phones
use face recognition software. Right.

2300
02:19:57,620 --> 02:20:02,360
With the Samsung phones have it, you know,
my, my galaxy note nine has it. Yeah.

2301
02:20:02,361 --> 02:20:05,990
I phones have it. Yeah. And you're
psyched about it. You're just like, oh,

2302
02:20:05,991 --> 02:20:07,850
that's cool. I don't have to
put in my password anymore.

2303
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:10,220
It's just look at it now I'm in my app.

2304
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:13,100
They also have one that's
an iris scanner on the note.

2305
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:17,810
The note scans your irises.
Oh, really? Wow. Borough.

2306
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:23,030
It's quick too. It looks at your eyeballs
like, Yep. Yeah. You, she do, you know,

2307
02:20:23,031 --> 02:20:24,650
man, what does that say, Jamie?

2308
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:27,590
I was trying to find it the
first time you brought up,

2309
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:31,940
but I know that there's these masks
that exist that are in quotes like hyper

2310
02:20:31,941 --> 02:20:35,240
realistic masks and that can be used to,
I don't know if it's this,

2311
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:37,550
this and it's used to
help the face recognition,

2312
02:20:37,551 --> 02:20:41,180
but I think people are using them to trick
it and do fake stuff and like not all,

2313
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:44,930
if you could commit a robbery with that
on and just like having a ski mask on

2314
02:20:44,931 --> 02:20:47,330
now they just can't see her face.
But it'll thinks that right.

2315
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:50,600
If you had a Hoodie on. Yeah.
What about in minority report?

2316
02:20:50,601 --> 02:20:52,220
Remember when they had to pull his eye,

2317
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:55,610
they were selling eyeballs on the black
market for the eye scan to get into

2318
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:59,990
buildings and staff to do with that is
put like a Bandana around your mouth.

2319
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:03,440
Right? So it could, no one
could see your mouth moving.

2320
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:07,580
Have that thing on your
sunglasses. Yeah, but my,

2321
02:21:07,581 --> 02:21:11,570
even my iPhone gets through my sunglasses.
I don't know how I know.

2322
02:21:11,571 --> 02:21:15,290
So let's face some recognition. So,
but what I'm saying is with this,

2323
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:20,030
like if you wanted to rob someone and
have something like even the facial

2324
02:21:20,031 --> 02:21:21,200
recognition software would,

2325
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:25,040
would think that it would legitimately
think you were somebody else.

2326
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:26,630
Hopefully now.

2327
02:21:26,631 --> 02:21:31,010
And what about for when we're doing our
crowd and we were trying to rob us or

2328
02:21:31,011 --> 02:21:33,590
hopefully not moody guys.
Criminals.

2329
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:40,450
That's crazy. It's kind of happen, but
it's so fast too. I mean, you know,

2330
02:21:40,470 --> 02:21:41,600
this is so new.

2331
02:21:41,690 --> 02:21:45,020
We're also the like the special effects
technology that allows people to make

2332
02:21:45,021 --> 02:21:46,210
faces the code.

2333
02:21:46,350 --> 02:21:51,350
Look how beautiful those things look
so close to a person of these for a 200

2334
02:21:51,951 --> 02:21:56,400
bucks. You could fly. One should do
it. Listen, I'm going to get you, oh,

2335
02:21:56,630 --> 02:22:00,880
I should buy you and then see if
I go open up your phone. Yeah,

2336
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:04,070
that would be crazy. That
would be cool. That'd be crazy.

2337
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:06,770
See if it can open up your phone.
Look super creepy.

2338
02:22:06,771 --> 02:22:10,610
But oh that's so weird.
Oh he looks like a demon.

2339
02:22:10,660 --> 02:22:14,060
If they can add a little late texted
or it could be moveable Kinda. Wow.

2340
02:22:14,061 --> 02:22:16,820
That looks pretty real though. I
mean, you know a little creepy,

2341
02:22:16,821 --> 02:22:19,480
but that looks pretty
accurate. That's crazy. Act.

2342
02:22:19,481 --> 02:22:22,850
I wouldn't look twice on the walking down
the street and even think about it now.

2343
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:26,790
You'd be like, that guy has a good shave.
Sorry. Beautiful Person. A skin so smooth.

2344
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:29,610
Your baby's bottom.

2345
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:37,500
It was started off. That's my face.com
and it's not been switched to whatever.

2346
02:22:37,501 --> 02:22:40,890
This is your meeting surveillance.
That's just creepy. She's there.

2347
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:45,390
Do you guys know, is there a problem
with doing like any of those, uh,

2348
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:49,800
23 and me ancestry DNA,
bro. The government.

2349
02:22:50,210 --> 02:22:53,970
You're going to the Illumina and he's
going to check your fucking spit. Do they?

2350
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:56,580
Is it bad to do? I don't
know. Should I do not do it?

2351
02:22:56,581 --> 02:22:59,140
What are they going to do with it?
How are they going to clone me, Bro?

2352
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:02,160
If they want your DNA, they can get
it just by touching your clothes,

2353
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:05,690
getting ahold of your stuff. They
can get ahold of you. They could,

2354
02:23:05,970 --> 02:23:10,170
they could find out all sorts of stuff
from hair samples right behind hair.

2355
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:13,500
If you drink a Starbucks
and then they grab your cup,

2356
02:23:13,550 --> 02:23:15,360
they can get a DNA sample off your cop,

2357
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:19,260
then someone can get your DNA sample
right. So it doesn't really matter.

2358
02:23:19,630 --> 02:23:23,670
So if I want to find out if I'm Greek or
Italian, she find out, I should find out.

2359
02:23:23,930 --> 02:23:26,500
It's pretty comprehensive. Have you done
it? Yeah, I've done it. Oh yeah. Yeah.

2360
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:30,690
It's interesting. It gives you a lot
of other weird stuff too. Like um, uh,

2361
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:34,740
that you might have certain genes that
for certain proclivities even including

2362
02:23:34,741 --> 02:23:39,450
like lactose intolerance, uh, propensity
to alcohol, really alcoholism.

2363
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:45,570
Some super athletes have certain muscle
jeans you should find out if you have

2364
02:23:45,571 --> 02:23:47,310
those genes,
like power athletes,

2365
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:52,080
like almost extraordinary number of ones
that are successful in certain sports.

2366
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:56,290
Oh really? Yeah. A type of Jean or
does it, and it gives you all this,

2367
02:23:56,291 --> 02:24:00,560
so you have to specify this at all. It's
a really detailed report. Oh Wow. Yeah,

2368
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:04,290
it's really detailed and covers
all sorts of different categories.

2369
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:07,470
And it's cool too.
And you find out like weird stuff.

2370
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:12,180
You know what part of Europe
your parents were from, you know,

2371
02:24:12,630 --> 02:24:17,430
maybe you have some Asian
in you didn't know you had.
It's, it's really cool. Yeah,

2372
02:24:17,431 --> 02:24:19,920
that's cool. It's cool.
It's, um, it's just,

2373
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:25,160
it makes you really think like to
get here in 2019 what had to happen.

2374
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:32,190
He all the people in the past and
if you keep going back, you know,

2375
02:24:32,191 --> 02:24:35,880
like I have a little bit of Asian in
me and it was like 1% or something like

2376
02:24:35,881 --> 02:24:38,910
that. But I think like where did that
come from? Like who, where was that?

2377
02:24:38,911 --> 02:24:40,980
Is that why you liked you?
Just to I don't think so.

2378
02:24:41,910 --> 02:24:46,890
I think a lot of people just like Jujitsu
Bro. Is that why he likes Sushi? Um,

2379
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:50,280
I don't think it's that Asia, they come
from a different agent, but I don't know.

2380
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:55,290
I think, um, I think, you know,
if you could show somebody though,

2381
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:58,470
went through Asia and hooked up
with somebody. Yeah, for sure.

2382
02:24:58,590 --> 02:25:03,590
But what I'm saying is I think that if
you look at what technology was available

2383
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:06,000
like 200 years ago for
finding the ancestry,

2384
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:10,440
people didn't even know if that was
their kid 50 years ago. Right, exactly.

2385
02:25:10,441 --> 02:25:11,730
Two years ago he had a guest,
you know?

2386
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:14,010
I mean maybe they had
paternity tests 50 years ago.

2387
02:25:14,011 --> 02:25:17,370
Did they like just trying to
find your roots back in Italy?

2388
02:25:17,371 --> 02:25:20,670
You just have to go find like town hall
and see if there's a book with your

2389
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:22,770
great grandfather's name
in it. Yeah, but I mean,

2390
02:25:22,771 --> 02:25:25,400
you didn't know if your dad was really
your dad. If your mom was a hoe.

2391
02:25:26,250 --> 02:25:28,990
I knew that. I knew that around
sixth grade. I figured that out.

2392
02:25:32,510 --> 02:25:34,660
It's wanting to know a hundred years ago,

2393
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:37,120
if you were the father of someone's child,
you to look at the kid and go,

2394
02:25:37,150 --> 02:25:40,060
the kid looks like me, or convince
yourself with the kid looks like,

2395
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:42,910
or convince yourself the kid
just got your wife's features,

2396
02:25:42,911 --> 02:25:45,100
but it's still your kid right now.

2397
02:25:45,101 --> 02:25:48,400
You can actually get DNA test done and
be like, oh, you know what the coldest,

2398
02:25:48,401 --> 02:25:51,370
hardest shit is when you find
out that it's not your kid,

2399
02:25:51,371 --> 02:25:54,880
but you still have to pay child support
because you've been paying child support

2400
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:58,390
and you still have to,
if the DNA confirms that he's not,

2401
02:25:58,530 --> 02:26:01,320
it's in different states.
There's different rules. But uh,

2402
02:26:01,321 --> 02:26:04,230
I believe that's how it is in California
and I believe that's how it is in

2403
02:26:04,231 --> 02:26:08,970
several other states where if, uh, it
turns out the young lady had strayed,

2404
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:13,860
ah, no caught subside. Dick is a,

2405
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:18,120
hey, hey, woo, got to go now.

2406
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:22,920
You got to keep paying. Yeah. Who you
know, that's not gonna keep paying.

2407
02:26:23,130 --> 02:26:26,310
Even if you do a DNA test and you
find out the child's not yours,

2408
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:28,740
I think once you have started paying,
unless you,

2409
02:26:29,220 --> 02:26:32,970
you might have to go to court and,
and Duke it out both.

2410
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:36,690
I don't think your payment obligation
stops just because it's not your kid.

2411
02:26:37,230 --> 02:26:41,580
And what a weird shift to if like you
think it's this kid and you're supporting

2412
02:26:41,581 --> 02:26:44,190
them and then to beat
switching your head like, no,

2413
02:26:44,191 --> 02:26:45,510
I'm not going to help him anymore.

2414
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:49,190
They didn't have testing really
until the 80s whoa. Yeah,

2415
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:53,430
until the 80s Oh, it's a
whole new world. Oh No,

2416
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:55,870
no.

2417
02:26:55,870 --> 02:26:58,560
[inaudible] was one of the first one that
people didn't really even believe it.

2418
02:26:58,561 --> 02:27:02,610
Remember? That's kind of how
I got on. Right. That's right.

2419
02:27:02,611 --> 02:27:04,860
And they started just see us saying
that they didn't know how to handle the

2420
02:27:04,861 --> 02:27:06,010
samples and they,

2421
02:27:06,050 --> 02:27:10,110
well there was some funkiness with
that two stepping all over it.

2422
02:27:11,130 --> 02:27:13,500
They didn't believe the one
in a trillion kind of numbers.

2423
02:27:13,501 --> 02:27:14,334
They were passing out of it.

2424
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:19,780
Thank overzealous aggressive
like police and detectives.

2425
02:27:22,011 --> 02:27:24,920
I think that's common.
I think that's the short term it is.

2426
02:27:25,070 --> 02:27:28,580
Did you see that fucking video?
It happened. Tesla sentiment mode.

2427
02:27:28,581 --> 02:27:30,260
Did you see that shit? Now, you know,

2428
02:27:30,261 --> 02:27:35,261
Tesla is a century mode and it caught
some politician back in is escalate into a

2429
02:27:35,301 --> 02:27:39,260
model three scuffing it up,
getting out, looking at it,

2430
02:27:39,410 --> 02:27:41,930
trying to rub it out,
and then taking off.

2431
02:27:42,530 --> 02:27:45,950
And they called him up because they
could see his face in the video and they

2432
02:27:45,951 --> 02:27:50,060
knew who it was because this guy had
been like a kind of prominent politician.

2433
02:27:50,630 --> 02:27:54,980
And so, um, here it is. There's
those little, the little nick,

2434
02:27:55,730 --> 02:27:58,100
but they said it was like $2,000 to fix.
And when Jesus,

2435
02:27:58,101 --> 02:27:59,660
that's a lot of money for that,
a little nicotine,

2436
02:27:59,950 --> 02:28:03,350
it seems a little ridiculous little scuff.
Um,

2437
02:28:03,351 --> 02:28:07,880
so the dude just backs into
it and tries to jump. Yeah.

2438
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:13,980
It's funny. Yeah. Bonk right
into the Tesla is the side.

2439
02:28:14,350 --> 02:28:18,830
It's always recording.
He just backed his stupid car.

2440
02:28:19,730 --> 02:28:23,330
Guy Just doesn't know how to drive.
He might've been drunk. Yeah.

2441
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:28,730
Oh yeah. Look at him. Look,
sat down. Looks at it. All
right. You don't have to. Well,

2442
02:28:28,731 --> 02:28:32,240
he tried to fix it. He's in deep shit.
He tried to fix it. The fuck he did.

2443
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:34,430
He did not, if when they
call them, oh they did cat.

2444
02:28:34,431 --> 02:28:39,080
And apparently that guy had already been
to jail for something else here. Dirty.

2445
02:28:39,081 --> 02:28:42,440
Yeah. He, uh, it's not good. It might be.

2446
02:28:44,410 --> 02:28:45,790
That's our map. I, um,

2447
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:51,670
I bumped into someone's car once and I
left a note with my phone number and my,

2448
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:56,600
uh, my address. Nice or not my
address, my phone number and my name.

2449
02:28:56,960 --> 02:29:01,960
And they called me up and they just so
happened to be very good friends with

2450
02:29:02,331 --> 02:29:03,380
someone who else runs with.

2451
02:29:04,340 --> 02:29:07,760
So then he calls me up and he tells me,
dude,

2452
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:12,500
you hit my friend's car. I
go, tell him to call me, man.

2453
02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:17,480
It's cool. Yeah, it was
unthinkable. I, it wasn't bad,

2454
02:29:17,481 --> 02:29:21,500
but it was something, I was like, it
was a little scuff on the bumper. Right.

2455
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,730
But it was my, it was, I was like,
oh, thank God I left a message.

2456
02:29:26,170 --> 02:29:28,100
I would feel like such a
piece of shit. Yeah, exactly.

2457
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:32,120
I wrote my friend and he was like,
some fucking ass hole.

2458
02:29:32,121 --> 02:29:37,100
Hit my friend's car and took off. You
believe that shit. I'm like, no, crazy,

2459
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:42,050
bro. That's, that's bullshit. And now
cameras have everybody doing everything.

2460
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:43,760
So you'll always get busted.
Yeah.

2461
02:29:43,761 --> 02:29:46,370
When do you think it's going
to be where you have a Tesla?

2462
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:47,660
You know what those things do?

2463
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:50,210
When do you think it's going to be
where no one's driving? How many,

2464
02:29:50,211 --> 02:29:53,380
how many more years? Well, we're,

2465
02:29:53,390 --> 02:29:58,210
a lot of people aren't driving 20 I would
say 20 to 30 you remember when Prius

2466
02:29:58,211 --> 02:30:03,211
is where a joke someone had a preach to
like get that fucking stupid thing away

2467
02:30:03,621 --> 02:30:07,060
from me? Yeah. Or even the
early Tesla. The roadster. Like,

2468
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:11,660
do you know that top gear you want to,
you know that British show top gear?

2469
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:12,711
Here's what's crazy.

2470
02:30:12,711 --> 02:30:17,711
I found out they did an episode where
they pretended that the Tesla roadster

2471
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:21,920
died on them while they were
driving around the track.

2472
02:30:21,921 --> 02:30:23,060
But it didn't really die on though.

2473
02:30:23,090 --> 02:30:27,950
That was just a storyline was they
wanted it to die. So it's gross.

2474
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:30,050
Apparently the way the show is made,

2475
02:30:30,051 --> 02:30:34,160
it's like a comedy show and it's
scripted so they can get away with doing

2476
02:30:34,161 --> 02:30:34,994
something like that.

2477
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:39,410
So Elon Musk's sued them
and I think he lost,

2478
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:43,730
believe it or not,
cause they don't claim to be exactly.

2479
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:47,270
They don't claim to be factual and
they complained. They, they don't,

2480
02:30:47,870 --> 02:30:52,040
they don't claim to not have
narratives. Right. They create. Cool.

2481
02:30:52,041 --> 02:30:56,230
So gross that up just to make
sure that I'm that grocery gross.

2482
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:58,640
It's amazing how many
shots that they take.

2483
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:02,630
Elan Musk called top gear completely
phony and his company sued for libel and

2484
02:31:02,631 --> 02:31:03,291
malicious false.

2485
02:31:03,291 --> 02:31:06,680
So it's a judge dismissed the suit in
October saying no view or the program

2486
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:10,760
could have reasonably be compared the
roadsters performance on the track to real

2487
02:31:10,761 --> 02:31:14,510
world performance on the street. That
seems fuzzy. I don't know what that means.

2488
02:31:15,380 --> 02:31:19,190
Okay. What is um, 2012
that one. What is the case?

2489
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:22,800
What did he said?
What Elon Musk said that it was,

2490
02:31:22,801 --> 02:31:27,780
that they faked it and they
claimed the power Tesla for, okay,

2491
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:30,600
let's see what it says. We
could figure out, I think,

2492
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:34,710
I'm pretty sure that's the story.
After Tessa dropped the car off,

2493
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:37,560
Elon Musk claimed that one of his
employees was along for the delivery.

2494
02:31:37,561 --> 02:31:40,710
Notice that a script for the episode
inside there was a segment about the Tesla

2495
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:43,380
breaking down,
but that was only the tip of the iceberg.

2496
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:47,160
Top gear claim that the Tesla roadster
ran out of power while driving after just

2497
02:31:47,161 --> 02:31:51,780
55 miles, much less than the 200
miles quartered by Tesla all be it.

2498
02:31:51,810 --> 02:31:55,920
It was being driven hard. A claim that
Musk said was untrue. According to him,

2499
02:31:56,250 --> 02:31:56,671
the roads,

2500
02:31:56,671 --> 02:32:00,990
there's logs show that the car had
never dipped below 20% charge during the

2501
02:32:00,991 --> 02:32:05,490
entirety of the filming. The clip followed
with the roadsters motor overheating,

2502
02:32:05,491 --> 02:32:08,820
which wasn't addressed by mosque.
And finally a break failure,

2503
02:32:08,910 --> 02:32:13,910
which must claims was instead a blown
fuse and not an equipment failure.

2504
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:17,850
Battery powered electric cars
will soon die altogether.

2505
02:32:17,970 --> 02:32:19,860
Former top care host James Mason.

2506
02:32:19,970 --> 02:32:24,070
Ah, interesting. Isn't it
amazing? So there was something,

2507
02:32:24,290 --> 02:32:26,420
sounds like there was
some horseshit for sure,

2508
02:32:26,421 --> 02:32:29,810
but it does sound like there was a real
break problem and the brake problem was

2509
02:32:29,811 --> 02:32:32,120
a blown fuse, which there's
nothing you can do about that,

2510
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:36,030
but just that he hates such a
strange thing that like, yeah,

2511
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:38,970
you just have to attack electric
cars. Like it's just a, well,

2512
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:42,160
I think the wem them making a script.

2513
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:45,040
If they had a script that said that
the test was going to break down,

2514
02:32:45,041 --> 02:32:48,100
they thought it was be funny.
It's a comedy. It's a comedy show.

2515
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:51,940
Jeremy Clarkson was fucking
hilarious. He's really funny. Yeah.

2516
02:32:51,970 --> 02:32:55,690
But there is definitely people that are,
yeah.

2517
02:32:55,691 --> 02:32:58,870
You believe a lot of the stuff that
they say and the performance of the car.

2518
02:32:59,020 --> 02:33:01,300
I would, you know, I always
thought it was funny,

2519
02:33:01,301 --> 02:33:06,130
but I also saw them as experts.
Well, they kind of are.

2520
02:33:06,670 --> 02:33:11,290
I mean, they know a lot of shit. Yeah.
They know a lot of shit about cars,

2521
02:33:11,291 --> 02:33:13,330
for sure. Jeremy Clarkson,
he knows a lot about cars.

2522
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:17,950
The problem is people go to them for
advice and lap times and all that shit.

2523
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:21,580
And if you're saying it, cars breaking
down and you, you engineered that script,

2524
02:33:21,581 --> 02:33:23,260
it's pretty dirty. It is dirty. Well,

2525
02:33:23,261 --> 02:33:27,160
that's how like Sean Hannity gets away
with saying that he's not a news program.

2526
02:33:27,340 --> 02:33:31,450
Does he get away with that? So it's a
WWE of news. He says it's a, it's a,

2527
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:34,630
it's entertainment really.
He says, yeah. Yeah. Oh,

2528
02:33:34,810 --> 02:33:39,670
do you have a little, a little out. We're
not a news program. We don't claim to be.

2529
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:41,380
He says that.
Yeah.

2530
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:44,860
Although a lot of people are
coming to teeth thinking it's news,

2531
02:33:44,890 --> 02:33:49,570
but isn't he a commentary program?
Isn't that what they say? Oh,

2532
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:53,910
he's not that. He's new. He says
it's entertainment. Oh yeah. Do you,

2533
02:33:53,911 --> 02:33:58,540
do you find entertaining?
No. No. I should just say,

2534
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:01,550
oh, I could do this as it's
entertaining. He's a liar. He,

2535
02:34:01,570 --> 02:34:03,850
it's not that entertaining.
I didn't find it entertaining.

2536
02:34:05,050 --> 02:34:09,410
I'm going to sue them and the
game of Thrones people tracking

2537
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:16,030
those aren't real drag dope as fuck.
Did you watch last night? I didn't.

2538
02:34:16,480 --> 02:34:19,840
I did was again, spoiler alert.
It was awesome. Oh yeah. Awesome.

2539
02:34:19,841 --> 02:34:23,230
Just to see everything. I just want to
see it. I was happy to see a new episode.

2540
02:34:23,231 --> 02:34:26,320
I'm going to be so sad when that
show gets canceled. I'm such a Dork.

2541
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:30,370
You've watched it all the way out and
about doing the prequel or the beginning

2542
02:34:30,371 --> 02:34:33,360
of it worry series, but
they haven't come. Amen.

2543
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:36,520
Whoever the fuck of people other than
doing it. You just keep doing things.

2544
02:34:37,390 --> 02:34:40,300
Whoever those people that are writing
and producing it and putting it together

2545
02:34:40,301 --> 02:34:42,760
and keep hiring those actors to
play different people. I don't care.

2546
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:46,590
I lost my way after like maybe three
seasons. How many seasons is it benign?

2547
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:48,670
Like five. Fuck up. You lost your way.

2548
02:34:48,671 --> 02:34:53,300
Go back and start from scratch and learn
all the names of these places and the

2549
02:34:53,301 --> 02:34:57,950
make believe thing.
Whatever's,

2550
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:02,050
how much do I have to know, Joe? I
know what you know how to make bread.

2551
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:06,070
Just keep making a dish is bread.
I do keep it simple.

2552
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:11,440
A Martini, a little bread. Little
run. It live your life. Yeah. Jog.

2553
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:14,890
How much? Why do I have to do
I have to control everything?

2554
02:35:16,030 --> 02:35:19,780
I would like to nef. Oh,
catch back up with it. Yeah,

2555
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:21,860
it's good. Right? People like you.

2556
02:35:21,861 --> 02:35:25,000
So you're going to like let this whole
season play by without you being caught

2557
02:35:25,001 --> 02:35:29,740
up. I F I almost last night it was just
going to watch just jumpers jump in.

2558
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:34,480
Who cares if I show that you never get
like please tell me you gave up on the

2559
02:35:34,481 --> 02:35:38,980
walking dead. Yes. Thank you.
Yeah, I stopped that one.

2560
02:35:38,981 --> 02:35:43,270
Is there any show that you haven't
given up on that you've been steadfast?

2561
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:48,490
That I stay. What? I mean you binge then
you still watch, uh, you haven't quit?

2562
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:52,870
No, there's none that I'm currently
watching. I just watched Russian doll.

2563
02:35:52,930 --> 02:35:55,210
What does that, that's on
Netflix? That was good.

2564
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:58,620
That girls like an assassin or
something? No, she's, she's uh,

2565
02:35:58,810 --> 02:36:03,040

groundhog day. Yeah. It was pretty good.

2566
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:05,680
And uh, no, I've seen all the big ones.

The Ozark Ozaki a one season of it.

2568
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:12,790
Do you didn't watch season two?
Was I supposed to?

2569
02:36:15,710 --> 02:36:18,340
I don't know how you just shut it off.
You don't want to know what happened?

2570
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:19,780
I don't know.
I forget.

2571
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:27,880
It's already forget. Fuck.
It's already three o'clock,

2572

three o'clock in the afternoon and
the time fly in this conversation.

2573

I'm going to North Hampton. We

2577
02:36:53,710 --> 02:36:57,290
What is that? It's this
elegant winery place. Right.

And they have stand up and stand up

Yeah. Okay. Doing a bunch of those kinds
of, it's actually a winery or real winery.

2580
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:10,150
Ah, yeah. They make their own wine.
Whoa. In Boston. That's cool. Yeah.

2581
02:37:10,151 --> 02:37:13,360
It's really cool. My friend had been
there before at a winery once. I was like,

2582
02:37:13,361 --> 02:37:17,270
this is the coolest shit ever. Yeah.
It's pretty cool. I'm going to do Napa.

The food, there's all, it's amazing.

2587
02:37:29,730 --> 02:37:33,500

out over time. They've got it dialed in.
