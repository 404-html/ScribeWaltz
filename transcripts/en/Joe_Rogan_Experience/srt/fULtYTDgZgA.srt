1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,400
I just don't as a mother
fucker and go on and stayed.

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,240
So Friday I went to the store
and I swear to God guys,

3
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:12,320
I didn't eat nothing all day.

4
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:16,070
I smoked some pot I worked
at before I left the house.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,530
It was a little Brownie.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,170
Let's 70 milligram brownies.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,320
I have like maybe 13
carbs left for the day.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,990
I was fucking starving.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,120
This little is right there.

10
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,050
It was a half a pack of an anarchy edible.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,030
They give you two brownies.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,380
Each brownie.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,370
It's 70 milligrams.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,320
That's so crazy and scary.

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,470
I rub my balls are 70 milligrams.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,081
You understand me?

17
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,600
70 milligrams uncle Joey is,

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,810
it's like an Aperitif.

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,540
It's not even a fucking explaining
to the rest of the world.

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
70 milligrams.

21
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:46,970
We'll put you into a fucking hole.

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,301
You know,

23
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:48,920
I gave him a 500 last night.

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,893
He shoots,

25
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,990
we split,

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,153
we

27
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,173
split

28
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,780
milligram edible and
song down at the hall.

29
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,531
Oh my God.

30
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,364
Listen to me.

31
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,040
We split it at three
o'clock in the afternoon.

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,150
Oh my God.

33
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,230
What are you trying to prove?

34
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,550
I seven o'clock.

35
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,680
I was so fucked by eight
o'clock and you know,

36
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,610
usually when you eat your tamed animal,

37
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,803
Fuck No,

38
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,250
this turned on me.

39
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,160
This animal turn red dog.

40
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:25,220
Like I shot bitch beat
me at the submissions.

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,390
At one point I had the cheese doodles
that belongs to the baby pirate's booty.

42
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,830
They were on the floor.

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,240
They were just coming out of my face.

44
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,313
I was just stuff.

45
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,490
I was just stuffing pirate's booty in
my face and a pair I couldn't stop.

46
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,340
I kept eating peaches and pirate's booty,

47
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,021
pirate's booty,

48
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,520
cantaloupe and pirate's booty.

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,110
I must state the whole baby.

50
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:48,830
My wife was like,

51
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,921
oh.

52
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:51,110
Cause I had my back turned to
them so they couldn't see me.

53
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,831
My wife's like,

54
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,270
what the fuck are you doing it?

55
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,600
I go,

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:57,860
listen,

57
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,581
I gotta go to this bed.

58
00:01:58,581 --> 00:01:58,881
She goes,

59
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,810
go to bed already.

60
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:03,710
I went to [inaudible] 45 I
slept till four I got up,

61
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:04,730
I didn't know where I was.

62
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,980
30 minutes like Mad Max.

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,660
I just laid bill c four in the morning.

64
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:12,331
You didn't know where you were.

65
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:12,901
So low.

66
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,590
I put 30 I woke up when a car,

67
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,433
the energy,

68
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,370
energy,

69
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,210
I wanted to shower.

70
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,550
I washed the car breakfast.

71
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,571
Oh my God.

72
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:24,170
I was fucked up and I kept
calling lead and say elite.

73
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:24,720
If the cops,

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,970
coy don't answer the phone,

75
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:26,241
and he goes,

76
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:26,331
well,

77
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:27,151
I haven't comps on the court.

78
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:27,681
And I got on that,

79
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,160
but they'll answer.
