1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,020
Go about it.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,620
Go live.

3
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:01,950
It's true.

4
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,311
Five,

5
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:02,671
four,

6
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:03,504
three,

7
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,590
two,

8
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,340
one.

9
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:05,581
Nice,

10
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:06,414
true.

11
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,871
All right.

12
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,810
We're not waiting for Brian Callen and
longer we're watching these fights.

13
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,310
These fights already happened.

14
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:14,941
Uh,

15
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:15,790
Eddie Bravo's here.

16
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,930
Hey Cause Brendan Schwab is in the law.

17
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:21,840
Uh,

18
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,810
the UFC from Fortaleza
up Brazil last night.

19
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,231
Uh,

20
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,250
I did not watch it.

21
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:27,360
I know none of the results.

22
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm so proud of myself.

23
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,670
I've never done this before.

24
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,811
So we're gonna wash these.

25
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,440
Brian Count pretended he
forgot what time it is.

26
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,820
He pretended that his phone didn't
automatically update like who's fucking

27
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,470
phone.

28
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,270
It doesn't automatically do
daylight savings time bitch,

29
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,500
your phone switches over.

30
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,910
Your phone knows what's going on.

31
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,181
Bitch,

32
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:46,320
most of us have an apple.

33
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,630
I automatically did it.

34
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,980
I had no idea there was
a time change the story.

35
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,750
I looked at my watch and I was like,

36
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:59,400
why is my rock watch wrong?

37
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,290
Like I knew my watch was wrong.

38
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,370
Like anywhere.

39
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,290
Like I just use my phone
and then they're like know,

40
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,831
I'm like,

41
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,430
you're a farmer.

42
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,600
I knew because the sun was in up.

43
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,820
Cause my kid wakes up early as fuck.

44
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,691
And I was like,

45
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:09,961
what?

46
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,640
It is not some little clock man.

47
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,650
Cause the sun would be out,

48
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,261
you know Eddie,

49
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,460
do you know any of the results?

50
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,700
I know one fine.

51
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,500
You son of Bill.

52
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,130
She does.

53
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,120
Cause she did your boy.

54
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,390
Yeah.

55
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,201
Don't even say nothing.

56
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:19,920
Don't say nothing.

57
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,010
And do you know any of the results?

58
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,660
No.

59
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,171
I watched the,

60
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:25,500
I watched the prelims and then I was
good and I was lucky because I had boxing

61
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,150
Lemieux verse Stephen's,

62
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:29,520
which was a fucking fight.

63
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,430
Damn I heard it was great.

64
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,570
Some dude got so mert Stephen's
gotten murked so bad by law.

65
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,480
You just told me,

66
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,380
you just told me what happened.

67
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:38,101
You son of a bitch.

68
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,470
Fuck me.

69
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,473
Fuck Bro.

70
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,421
Come on man.

71
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:43,300
Hbo Boxing,

72
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,060
she dude,

73
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:45,894
he was out.

74
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,331
I had,

75
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:47,164
I don't know,

76
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,270
hopefully he's alive.

77
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,940
Let me kill together.

78
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,520
He can crack crack,

79
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:51,750
crack.

80
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,930
Both of them can and it was in lieu
mute came in heavier and if people were

81
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:55,110
like,

82
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,130
oh he might be out of shape.

83
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,850
And they,

84
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,000
when you talked about a high level
fight championship fight and dudes were,

85
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,541
I mean,

86
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,021
they were like,

87
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,070
fuck 12 rounds.

88
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,610
Wow.

89
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,080
It was fun for that.

90
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,610
Did horrible.

91
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,630
Really awful.

92
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,613
What was that fight?

93
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,670
Uh,

94
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,740
I forget the guy who was a horrible fight.

95
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,880
Even Max Kellerman and,

96
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,270
uh,

97
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,890
Lambert were like,

98
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,270
they got,

99
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,381
well,

100
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:14,410
we apologize.

101
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,901
They were like,

102
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,370
that was a snooze fest.

103
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,540
Hopefully this one lives up to it.

104
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,260
And they said,

105
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,200
I never Apollo,

106
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,700
I can't.

107
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,180
I've never,

108
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,570
I don't think I've ever apologize
for a fight that's brought,

109
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,590
I've never heard a guy
apologize for a fight.

110
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,930
They would just kind of clowning on it.

111
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,290
Oh.

112
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,600
Like after we,

113
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,810
after sitting through that,

114
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,950
thank God for this flight.

115
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:32,101
You know,

116
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,350
you guys would never do that ever,

117
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:34,890
right?

118
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,723
I don't think so.

119
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,241
We'd have to be,

120
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,920
something would have to be really wrong,

121
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,170
but there've been some fights
that were really crazy.

122
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,380
I remember that Nate quarry fight where
the duty was fighting from the ultimate

123
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,214
fighter.

124
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,670
Goddammit,

125
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,503
I forget the,

126
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,070
forget the fellow's name,

127
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,380
but he was literally
running away backwards.

128
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:50,930
He had broken his foot or some stones.

129
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,110
Starnes thank you.

130
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,120
Literally like backpedaling.

131
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,720
And then Nate quarries starts doing some
crazy thing where he puts his hand up

132
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,490
in front of his face and he's just
walking him like going like this.

133
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,830
He's like mocking him.

134
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,770
And it was fun though.

135
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,530
And then the dude gave them two
fingers but he's just not engaging.

136
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,870
It was real weird at the
end of the guy's career.

137
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,531
Okay,

138
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,430
let's it's downhill from,

139
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:12,120
well Caleb went to fight in
some other organizations.

140
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,250
I believe he's good friends with Tate
cause they were on the same seats.

141
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,110
That was that season two season
two or three Canadian feller,

142
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:19,330
right?

143
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,050
Yeah.

144
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah.

145
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
You backpedaling and gets
nothing gets Nate query.

146
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:24,071
I liked that guy.

147
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,250
But you think he was fighting t RTP
doorbell for the waves backpedaling?

148
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,581
It was,

149
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,160
I think he hurts something
and I think he was like,

150
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:30,580
you know what,

151
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,020
these guys are not paying me enough.

152
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,830
You know,

153
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,500
cause I think that was his
argument actually after the fact.

154
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:36,250
They're not paying me enough.

155
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,083
How much,

156
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,200
how little he gets paid.

157
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,190
She signed up for it.

158
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,140
But I think if you,

159
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,180
I think his mind was as soon as he
hurt his foot or something like that,

160
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,810
he was like,

161
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,381
fuck this.

162
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,310
I'm just going to get through these,

163
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,450
trying to get that,

164
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,751
you know?

165
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:46,991
He's like,

166
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:47,920
I can't hit right now.

167
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
I can't move right now.

168
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:51,190
Let me just look at your
doctor bill or whatever.

169
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,050
Knowing that you look at your memory,

170
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,300
you know where your members,

171
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,593
what's up?

172
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,000
Victor Belfor did not
look like a t t v tour.

173
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,500
Definitely clean the golden snitches out.

174
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,940
Everywhere he gets to present.

175
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,740
You see the fucking odds on the fight?

176
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,610
Yes.

177
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,540
I don't know who won the fight.

178
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,650
I don't know a god damn thing,

179
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,230
but I know that the odds were
crazy and Calvin's favorite.

180
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,230
How did it make sense to one?

181
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:17,064
Yeah,

182
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:17,951
it makes sense.

183
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,360
They'll think about beat
towards last fights,

184
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,590
gay guard than who?

185
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,810
Weidman before that,

186
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,500
like he just hasn't looked great at all,

187
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,550
especially that first round.

188
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,580
I had to fucking love Calvin at
one 85 I know people will say,

189
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,570
what will your Ramiro,

190
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:28,870
Bro,

191
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,351
I don't see.

192
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:29,891
I love him.

193
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:30,540
I don't like him.

194
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,050
With the top five matchups.

195
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,291
See,

196
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,970
I think if he just lifts weights,

197
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,840
it just gets in,

198
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,211
you know,

199
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,280
like serious condition.

200
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:39,880
I do like him in 25 though in it
because all his reach and everything,

201
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,211
I don't know,

202
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:40,391
man.

203
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:41,860
He looked pretty God damn good here.

204
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,910
He looked different.

205
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,743
He looked thick.

206
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,321
I mean,

207
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,850
Calvin's never going to look like
a bodybuilder that's not as bills,

208
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,723
but he's got it.

209
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,210
He's got a warrior's body
like that motherfucker.

210
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,780
He could go for days,

211
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,300
but then you add the muscle
to your point you had muscle.

212
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,410
Then what you have veto.

213
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,460
It looks so different.

214
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,400
Peter has that straight up dad TRT bond,

215
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,580
like got off of it and
then just straight dad.

216
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,571
I mean,

217
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,680
he still looks scary,

218
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,720
but nothing like the Rockhold.

219
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,510
Vituro hold for me.

220
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,850
Top three scariest fighters of all time.

221
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,070
I was thinking about right there.

222
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,030
There he is.

223
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,220
Look how God Damn Jackie was.

224
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,650
Quick spinning wheel kicks and Shit.

225
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,290
Remember we're maybe beat the
brakes off Anthony Johnson.

226
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,183
Yup.

227
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,150
Look at that.

228
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,730
Look at that dog jack.

229
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,740
He is when he threw that wheel
because it's shoulder hold everything.

230
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,100
His abs have muscles that you
wish she was still like that.

231
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,061
Pardon me?

232
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:34,630
Does,

233
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:34,901
yeah,

234
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,350
me too.

235
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,000
You can go to rise him now.

236
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,130
He's no,

237
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,600
he can easily go to rise and to
get paid and do that and yeah,

238
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,530
TRT.

239
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,550
We'll look at what truck up cro cop went
over there could hook up still doing

240
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:48,910
it.

241
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,670
You just got to wonder how many of
this before I was like 20 years.

242
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,151
Yeah,

243
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,280
he's 20 years.

244
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,010
But I think these guys on TRT,

245
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,370
they can compete

246
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,330
way longer than that.

247
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,280
Even if you let [inaudible] take whatever
the fuck he wants and let them go over

248
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,060
to Japan.

249
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,271
Oh,

250
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,650
he's spinning wheel kick in.

251
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,860
Bitches face off against 60 he's
going to be doing some crazy shit.

252
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,150
But here's the question.

253
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,420
What he would he be as aggressive?

254
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,980
He was fighting another dude on TRT.

255
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,120
Oh yeah.

256
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,630
You think so?

257
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,740
Just think about back in the day,

258
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:23,450
think about when he fought Vandelay
handling motherfuckers were juice monkeys.

259
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,200
Literally.

260
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,370
He was so aggressive.

261
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,030
Remember?

262
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,751
No technique,

263
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:29,000
just the lense bodybuilder,

264
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,440
straight punch like this.

265
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,510
We caught him with a straight
left and he was wearing shoes.

266
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:32,770
Yeah.

267
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,170
Fight.

268
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,003
Yes.

269
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,300
Wearing wrestling shoes.

270
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,710
Brazilian on Brazilian crime.

271
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Freisan sticks around and they become
like as powerful as pride was and there,

272
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,220
you know,

273
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,290
they just don't disappear
like a bunch of other shows.

274
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,130
There's going to be an outlet and a very
big outlet for people to retire from

275
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,550
the UFC and get back on TRT.

276
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,413
Like a master's.

277
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:56,990
Yeah.

278
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,050
Like re re jumpstart their career.

279
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,240
Do you know about one fcs weight cutting,

280
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:02,990
um,

281
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,501
program?

282
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:03,770
Do you,

283
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,603
do you know about it,

284
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,340
how bit rich Franklin was
helping him with that?

285
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:07,551
Right,

286
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,170
because you want talking about
that cut a lot of weight.

287
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,891
Yeah.

288
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,790
Those guys,

289
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,150
um,

290
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,421
they're,

291
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,840
they've got some new innovative
way they think to uh,

292
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,700
diminish the amount of weight guys cut.

293
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,710
I don't know exactly how they're doing it,

294
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,630
but I think it has something
to do with hydration test.

295
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,740
See if you could pull that up.

296
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,574
Jimmy Kim,

297
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,410
one FC.

298
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,310
Okay.

299
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,460
Can you imagine in negotiations
like rise in negotiations?

300
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,091
They say,

301
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:29,391
you know,

302
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,320
you wanted to her man,

303
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,190
that's to sell along down.

304
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:35,760
You just have give it
to you being screamed.

305
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,770
Shit,

306
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,880
we'll hook it up for you.

307
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,170
I have it right there on the table

308
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,780
with a needle.

309
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,260
Come on.

310
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,363
Alcohol.

311
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,520
It just highlights of when they're on TRT.

312
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,890
Knockdowns posters.

313
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,180
You walk into the room and there's
20 class screens and v tour.

314
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,640
We'll kick and rock holding the
head is things I'll fucked up.

315
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,913
Oh,

316
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,020
in the presentation
that just put it county.

317
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,850
Did you lock the door?

318
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,103
Lock the door.

319
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,780
Did you good man.

320
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,790
Well get sit down.

321
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,900
Have a seat top man.

322
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,191
No,

323
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:16,520
no,

324
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,353
no handshake.

325
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,553
Are you sick?

326
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,990
What are you doing and
not calling everybody.

327
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,950
I just knocked the boxer.

328
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,843
Now

329
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,930
have a seat.

330
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,750
Goddammit.

331
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,583
Welcome back.

332
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,700
Put the headsets on.

333
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,720
This is a good fight.

334
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,730
The first fight.

335
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,421
A lot of shit.

336
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:32,990
First fight.

337
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,640
Of course they did well the first fight
Tim means hit him with an illegal need

338
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,150
that a lot of us were unsure of.

339
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,800
I fucked that one up too.

340
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,340
I usually go on these all the time.

341
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,730
See Cause he's got one knee on the ground,

342
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,140
two hands up and we're like,

343
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,770
Ooh.

344
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,603
And here's the thing.

345
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,710
All he had on the ground was a knee.

346
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,630
He actually had even lifted his other leg
up and he didn't even have his foot on

347
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:54,464
the ground.

348
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,381
So it was like,

349
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:55,561
you know,

350
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,100
there was that whole

351
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,040
thing of points of contact to say you'd
have to have at least three points of

352
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,730
contact.

353
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,220
He actually only had one point of contact,

354
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,040
but if it's not the bottom of your foot,

355
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,874
it doesn't count.

356
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,470
So that's where it was so confusing.

357
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,540
Confusing that even mark Ratner,

358
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,740
when we went to him in the fight
for clarification on the rules,

359
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,670
he said it was legal.

360
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,640
He said it was illegal knee and then
big John McCarthy pulls me over and he

361
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:17,791
goes,

362
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,511
no.

363
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:18,751
He goes,

364
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,010
that's fucking illegal.

365
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:20,221
I go,

366
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:20,521
okay,

367
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,354
it is illegal.

368
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:21,751
I go,

369
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,850
so it's when you say points of contact,

370
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,130
like if it's only just a knee,

371
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:29,340
if only the knees on the ground and the
foot's not even on the ground and the

372
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,450
other foot's off the ground,

373
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,050
that's an,

374
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,160
that's a down opponent.

375
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,821
And he's like,

376
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:33,210
yes,

377
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,470
anything but the soles of the feet,

378
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,304
that's what it should say.

379
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,540
Anything but the soles of the feet.

380
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,800
So my thought was,

381
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,131
well,

382
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:40,560
what if some guy shoots
a power double on you,

383
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,460
right?

384
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,160
And his knees on the
ground as he sliding in,

385
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:48,440
which it often is and you fucking knee
him to oblivion as he's moving into that

386
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:48,990
position.

387
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,771
So it doesn't count,

388
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:50,070
right,

389
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,760
does it?

390
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,190
No.

391
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,023
Same Way.

392
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,480
But that's not really a transition.

393
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:57,300
I mean that's the guy making his approach
and you're countering his approach and

394
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,350
he has a down opponent.

395
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,940
He's got a knee on the ground.

396
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,590
He's sliding towards you.

397
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,160
I think that's a doubt opponent,

398
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,950
but we will not be the same like with a,

399
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,090
with a wheel kick lifetime,

400
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,220
it's behind the ear buds in transition.

401
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,970
That's a,

402
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,890
that's a creepy one.

403
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,730
I think it's different but similar.

404
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,690
Very similar that we talks about that a
million times because it's like it's the

405
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:16,500
best position to be.

406
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,610
If you get the guys back,

407
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,050
you see a wheel kit coming,

408
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,340
you want to turn your head right,

409
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,020
you want to turn your face and it's like,

410
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,170
no.

411
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,610
You mentioned during your face,

412
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,421
listen man,

413
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,720
there's no good place to take a
wheel kick ever except the body.

414
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:28,410
Like if you,

415
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,770
I would rather take one in
the arm or on the body live.

416
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:31,981
No,

417
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:32,760
it's horrible.

418
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,271
It's horrible.

419
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:33,660
It's,

420
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,280
it's a bone breaker for sure.

421
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:35,791
That's,

422
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,080
it's a,

423
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,530
it's so crazy that you have to pat up
your hands but you are allowed to spin and

424
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:42,110
with all of your body weight,

425
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:46,320
put it in your heel and and what would
he would Edson Barboza did to Terry Adam

426
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,870
remember that one jumping the buses now,

427
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,850
but he was never the same
again after that knock out.

428
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,740
I mean never the same again.

429
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,581
Never the same again.

430
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,990
Never fought at that level again.

431
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,920
Never that grazed the top of
his head bounced off his head.

432
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,210
You'll see it a million times.

433
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:04,140
It sounded like a like a melon
me person that the highlight,

434
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,060
it doesn't look like it connects flush.

435
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,380
It goes boom.

436
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:08,214
Top of the head.

437
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,970
Cause I remember it cause there
there was these entire flights.

438
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,990
I kept on that and I was like,

439
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:13,580
God,

440
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,280
it doesn't look like it was a fucking
straight up heel to the grill.

441
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:18,420
I'd have to see it again.

442
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,290
But the amount of power that you
have in all of your body weight,

443
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,880
if you have a really good one and you
can generate all that fucking torque and

444
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:29,880
your leg comes up and there's
so much weight behind it.

445
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,130
That's one of the reasons why I stopped
fighting was a knockout in 19 when I was

446
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,780
19 years old in Anaheim.

447
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:40,080
I will kick this guy in the head and he
never got up and they carried him off

448
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:40,680
the mat.

449
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,780
They had them in stretch of her half an
hour and then they brought him to the

450
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:43,131
hospital.

451
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,580
It scared the shit out of me.

452
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,380
My heels sore,

453
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,220
my heel,

454
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,053
my heel,

455
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,500
my fucking heel.

456
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,100
The hard part from his
face was sore for days,

457
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,861
like two days.

458
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:54,040
I was

459
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,550
walking with a little limp do.

460
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:58,240
I was thinking about that last night
when when Steven's got knocked up by

461
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,510
Lemieux and he just laying
there and there's a stretcher,

462
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,910
there's like five minutes go by
and you'd see them breathe in.

463
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:04,840
Amex Hellman goes,

464
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,421
well,

465
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:07,570
at least he's breathing and then his mom,

466
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:08,700
his cage silo,

467
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,140
all the fun out of the knocked out.

468
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,481
I was like,

469
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:10,911
Oh hell yeah,

470
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:11,181
I love you.

471
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:11,381
I said,

472
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,420
what kind of knock out a
box and left hook there?

473
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,220
Exchange left hooks and no,

474
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,100
no Stevenson.

475
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,511
Anyways,

476
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,900
but when he's out on the ground
and I was thinking myself,

477
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,370
what's the protocol?

478
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,230
So these being rushed to the hospital,

479
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,721
what are they?

480
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:28,300
They're looking for brain bleeding there.

481
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,490
I guess the guys out
more than four minutes.

482
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:31,324
You're in trouble.

483
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
A lot of trucks they,

484
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:32,531
yeah,

485
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:35,860
they mean they have to have really
experienced guys who've dealt with those

486
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:39,640
kinds of traumatic brain injuries
on site to get it and handle it.

487
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:39,910
Right.

488
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,700
That's one of the real issues with those
smaller shows where people that want to

489
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:43,534
do smokers,

490
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,790
if you're doing a smoker,

491
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,870
someone could easily get
head kicked with a smoker,

492
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:47,920
and by the way,

493
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,540
we'll kicks your legal and a smoker.

494
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,590
So think about that.

495
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,110
Think about everybody's wearing
those patterns shinning in staffs,

496
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,580
but you're not padding up your heel.

497
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:54,941
Now,

498
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,000
if someone decides to spin on you and
they catch you in the side of the head,

499
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,850
it doesn't matter if
you're wearing headgear,

500
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,431
let so many,

501
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,480
we'll kick you in the head.

502
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,760
It's like getting hit by it like a
tree like is so fucking big to get an a

503
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,200
baseball bat to your face.

504
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,620
Who you want by your
bedside is a Dr. Davidson.

505
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,400
There it is right here.

506
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,740
Oh yeah.

507
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,481
Doctor Davidson's.

508
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,860
Amazing what says to Davidson for the UFC.

509
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,370
Here it is.

510
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,900
Ooh,

511
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,733
what's this though?

512
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,780
And and fast motion.

513
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,070
The sound is horrible.

514
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,851
Oh my God.

515
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:25,810
What does Alfac left and then falls into
this thing and he's like that for the

516
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,190
next four or five minutes.

517
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,703
Oh

518
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,000
my God.

519
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,391
Well,

520
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:31,781
you know what,

521
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:32,051
man?

522
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:32,260
Here.

523
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,970
Exchange of hooks look
such a perfect chance

524
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,670
to talk about a power puncher.

525
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,391
Both these boys,

526
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,160
what a perfectly landed punch

527
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:50,030
your Marilyn Lemieux got dismantled by
triple g two which is so impressive in

528
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,690
fast motion and you're like
[inaudible] get dismantled.

529
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,100
You got the shit beat out of him.

530
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,820
But he took that fight into deeper
water than a lot of people expected.

531
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,080
A tough guy triple g through 50 something
jabbed in the first round because he

532
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,010
thought he was going to bang with them.

533
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:05,590
Triple g you see his jab
like Oh my God is he can,

534
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,200
he gets fucking bought like the loom.

535
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:10,180
You didn't really have
a chance the whole time.

536
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,090
He definitely didn't have a chance
but he definitely landed some shots.

537
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,240
I mean he definitely tested triple g
more than anybody had in recent fights

538
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,130
before that Lmu fan man too.

539
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,300
Like maybe cal Brooks tested him a little
bit too before triple g got to him.

540
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,410
But his corner was like,

541
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:25,120
throw the towel and as
soon as it looks sketchy,

542
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,370
they did the right move to,

543
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,070
he's not to get the fuck up but
couldn't see out of his eyes.

544
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,731
They were like,

545
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:30,971
yeah,

546
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:31,804
good enough.

547
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,013
Good job bro.

548
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,330
Fuck this.

549
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,991
Good for them.

550
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,800
And who is that guy that um,

551
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,630
fought Loma Chenko and
pulled out way early.

552
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:40,961
Oh,

553
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,310
you're talking about the Jamaican fellow,

554
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,813
but he was like,

555
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,090
I think it's 32 and then they're like,

556
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,470
he's never going to live this down.

557
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,080
He wasn't getting his ass whooped.

558
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,890
He was just like,

559
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,700
I can't beat a little bit.

560
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,150
I realize he was so outclassed.

561
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,980
Well that's so much fun to watch.

562
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,180
Amazing what the,

563
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,010
what the guy said in the
post fight interview.

564
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:58,370
He's like,

565
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,520
I saw where this was going

566
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,840
to live to fight another day.

567
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:03,531
That makes sense.

568
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:05,020
That's smart fighter.

569
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,320
Kevin says to him,

570
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,130
don't you think you know a lot of people
usually we envy those that go out on

571
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:10,791
their shield.

572
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,031
He's like,

573
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:11,211
no,

574
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,190
I get that now.

575
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,380
Look.

576
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,310
Lemme Chenko though.

577
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,643
Yeah,

578
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,510
to get the shit kicked out.

579
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,610
There's a lot of times where
guys moving around fine.

580
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:20,480
He looks good on TV,

581
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,900
but he knows in his head that he is
tuned up and one shot away from going

582
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,520
unconscious and guys just go,

583
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:26,354
that's it.

584
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,760
Or He's at just out of
tricks or he's just like,

585
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,230
that guy's figured out all my patterns.

586
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,020
He can do whatever he wants to meet and
I'm going to be just a punching bag.

587
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,321
Well,

588
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,151
you remember when,

589
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:34,490
uh,

590
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,020
Nigel Benn fought?

591
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,913
Um,

592
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,530
what,

593
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,060
what the,

594
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,510
what was it?

595
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,410
Homeboy's name?

596
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,533
Gerald Mclellan.

597
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,430
Thank you very much Ron.

598
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:42,264
Once when he,

599
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,621
yeah,

600
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,710
this is round one of all Avera.

601
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,430
Tim Means it's 48,

602
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,650
49 46 seconds into the or 46.

603
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,900
This should be three.

604
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:56,901
The number on the clock on
the screen is 414039383736.

605
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,461
All right,

606
00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:59,750
sync it up guys.

607
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,410
Just coming.

608
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:00,750
Thank you.

609
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,520
Jeremy means,

610
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,670
what were we just talking about?

611
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,040
Lemme Chanko uh,

612
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,880
you were talking about,

613
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,713
uh,

614
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,460
oh that got knowing that it was
never going to work out for him.

615
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,180
He was just,

616
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,320
he's just getting boxed up.

617
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,180
I was thing that Jeremy Mclellan fight,

618
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,940
like when Gerald went
down and like took a knee,

619
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,580
there wasn't like some big
punch that landed before that.

620
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,790
It was an accumulation of all the
stuff that led up to that moment.

621
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,870
And when he quit they were
like kind of shocked like no.

622
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,190
And then he photo the Kodo,

623
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,073
um,

624
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,060
Manny Pacquiao fight and
after the third round,

625
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,020
um,

626
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,010
you could hear him.

627
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:37,970
He wrote Freddy Gone.

628
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:39,050
You got to take them out.

629
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:42,230
And when we spoke to Friday after,

630
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,160
I don't want to tell him that,

631
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:43,850
but he said,

632
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,510
he said,

633
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,200
why didn't he knock him out
when he could have been Friday?

634
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,750
Said,

635
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,190
well he didn't want to hurt him.

636
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,290
That's public knowledge and is it?

637
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,780
Yeah,

638
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,551
that was crazy,

639
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:52,760
man.

640
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,550
Put his corner set to Miguel was like,

641
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,870
if we don't see any improvement,

642
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:57,710
we're going to stop it here.

643
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:58,800
This is getting bad at math.

644
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,480
And then Manny just
didn't want to hurt him.

645
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:00,681
He goes,

646
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:01,311
I could have knocked him out.

647
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,144
I didn't want to hurt him.

648
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,860
Amazing.

649
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,370
God.

650
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,650
That's what a what a nice guy.

651
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:05,484
What a nice guy.

652
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,530
So weird that he's so nice and yet
such a killer right now it's really,

653
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:12,320
he's a really odd world champion.

654
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,600
He really is in their hands
because of stuff going on.

655
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:19,250
My hair was wild as fuck and then he
found Jesus was trying to get up and he's

656
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:20,210
doing a pretty good job.

657
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,850
Where is his means?

658
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:24,410
High Level Jujitsu obviously.

659
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:24,630
Yeah.

660
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,270
Means is full rounded guy.

661
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,620
He's one of the best guys at one 70 he's
just like a sh a hair under some of the

662
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:31,700
other top guys.

663
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,900
Great at anything.

664
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,430
He's just that he's good at everything.

665
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,330
It's fun to watch.

666
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,380
He's great at elbows.

667
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,590
That motherfucker's got some nasty elbows,

668
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,201
good elbows.

669
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,860
I wouldn't say he's not like
top five in the division.

670
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,641
No elbows.

671
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:44,474
I think he is.

672
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,950
I'm saying got five overall.

673
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,230
He might have the best elbows
in the 170 pound division.

674
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,710
I'm not bullshitting
as aggressive sounding.

675
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,910
I'm telling you his elbows,

676
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,950
especially in the standup
positions are nasty.

677
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,330
He throws him real crisp.

678
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,160
He throws him in type positions.

679
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,260
Everything is like real efficient.

680
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,510
It's all done with like
real solid technique.

681
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,540
I mean there's better
fighters than him currently.

682
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:03,751
You know,

683
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,580
there's guys that have
a full complete game.

684
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,480
This guys like,

685
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,720
you know,

686
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,300
beasts like Tyron Woodley
or like Damien Maia,

687
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,081
he meet Damien Maia.

688
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:13,080
It's just a Goddamn B's top 10 would
be tough for him to be tough luck.

689
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,950
That's close.

690
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,191
Yeah.

691
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,810
All have errors all over too.

692
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,040
Good take down.

693
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,660
So you know that what
happened in the first fight?

694
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,350
So the first fight was called a no
contest because of the knee or the knee.

695
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,200
Yeah.

696
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,891
That's what it was called.

697
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:25,971
Right.

698
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:26,820
So confusing.

699
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,300
It was weird because they said
it was an unintentional foul,

700
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,610
but clearly he thought it was legal.

701
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,990
So was intentional.

702
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,690
They call him the dirty birds.

703
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,643
Yeah.

704
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,440
Cause we got caught by the golden
snitch and I actually won three.

705
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:41,490
Yeah.

706
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,320
He got caught by the
golden snitch with uh,

707
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,670
this tiny amount of some shit that
was in a supplement that he bought.

708
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,060
And so they bought the supplement randomly
from a store and they found the exact

709
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:51,540
same stuff.

710
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:51,750
You know,

711
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,940
look at 10 means body and got steroids.

712
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,830
Well it doesn't matter man.

713
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,610
Instead of taking steroids and
they don't really lift weights.

714
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:02,830
They just train Jujitsu and MMA and they
don't look any bigger than everything

715
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,290
else.

716
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:03,720
Yup.

717
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,291
Steroids.

718
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:04,770
I mean,

719
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,480
the real thing is the
guys that lift weights,

720
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,410
when Lance Armstrong was taking
hormones and all the shitty was taken,

721
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,490
he didn't look Jack.

722
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:13,650
Just the misconception of what it
thinks they're going to look like.

723
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,140
Coping just for a to
oxygenate their blood.

724
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:16,771
There are a lot of things,

725
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:16,950
right,

726
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,810
but it's also the tech testosterone,

727
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:19,471
AIDS recovery.

728
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,270
But the big thing is the only reason,

729
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,810
the only way you're getting bigger
is if you're lifting weights.

730
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,100
Like you're,

731
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,410
it's resistance exercise.

732
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:26,730
That's what makes your body get bigger.

733
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,740
It's not going to get bigger just by you.

734
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,470
Me Get a little bit bigger just
by doing kickbox and lean muscle.

735
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,210
You'll look bigger.

736
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:33,660
Yeah,

737
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,710
it'll be a little bit,

738
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,570
but not like you never gonna look like,

739
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,430
like Hector Lombard or anything.

740
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:38,611
Dude,

741
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,310
I would love to see tennis
as a random ass fight.

742
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,050
Even Cup was coming off a loss.

743
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,380
I'd like to see that.

744
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,550
Like Donald Cerrone cowboy
verse 10 means yeah,

745
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:48,420
it'd be a scrap.

746
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,910
Wasn't that scheduled at
one point in time in Denver?

747
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:52,744
And maybe I feel like,

748
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,701
boy,

749
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:54,060
why don't,

750
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,540
why am I fucking scrap?

751
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:56,731
Oh,

752
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:57,360
it'd be insane.

753
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,150
That's why I like to
watch Tim because it's in,

754
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:02,220
it sounds like that Matt
Brown type of crazy pace.

755
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Well he also has really good stand up
and he's a big tall guy and Donald,

756
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,800
you know Donald has that nasty more time.

757
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,920
Really good leg kicks.

758
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:11,991
I liked to,

759
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,560
Donald's taken some time off.

760
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,483
I love it.

761
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,990
I love those teachers.

762
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,973
Chill.

763
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,030
Just chill out.

764
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,440
Come up with a game plan and
make your world champion.

765
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,363
Yeah.

766
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,601
Yeah.

767
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:25,770
You were so right about how tough
that fight was with Matt Brown does.

768
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,940
Despite the victory,

769
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:30,450
despite the fact that he wanted you got
to remember he did get dropped in that

770
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,284
fight.

771
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,600
All we see is the highlight
of that head kick butt.

772
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,381
Fuck man.

773
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:35,370
That was a tough girl.

774
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,551
Yeah,

775
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,211
there was a lot going on.

776
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:37,410
A Walk in the park.

777
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,070
I saw the new King Kong
movie because I'm 12.

778
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,933
Is it good?

779
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,691
Loved it.

780
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,140
Cause I'm 12 toy,

781
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,620
they can't make enough King Kong's for me.

782
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,753
I love them.

783
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,020
This is probably the best one ever.

784
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,270
Is it good guys and not the space movie.

785
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:52,661
What is it?

786
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,440
But you know what?

787
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,780
They went full on diversity
in this King Kong.

788
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,501
First of all,

789
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,334
there's no rape.

790
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,140
King Kong no longer steals the girl.

791
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,251
Every other movie.

792
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,720
King Kong gets the girl and he's like,

793
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,620
oh I got this.

794
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,310
Just runs off of there and this one,

795
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,360
he just protects her and
he never tries to fuck her.

796
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:09,850
And he's so much bigger than
any other King Kong in the past.

797
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,200
This new King Kong,

798
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,670
this new King Kong,

799
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,700
literally a girl is not
even a lighter in his hand.

800
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,400
Yeah.

801
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,660
Yeah.

802
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,780
The new King Kong is way bigger than
the King Kong and the climb the empire

803
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,970
state building son of the old King Kong.

804
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,380
It's a totally new story.

805
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:23,951
It's a Ribeye.

806
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,610
Can't do that.

807
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,710
They can't do that new story.

808
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,810
Totally new story code.

809
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,930
Completely different style con had a kid,

810
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,531
the all the,

811
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:29,711
uh,

812
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:32,050
all the natives on the
island are all Asian now.

813
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,040
No more black people.

814
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,653
Oh yeah,

815
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,100
Bob with that is that gorillas should
be in the Congo and they shouldn't have

816
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:43,090
black south Pacific and these
is an island that time forgot.

817
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:46,600
It's a hollow earth and inside there's
these demons and then there's Kong and

818
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:46,960
cons.

819
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,800
Actually the hero,

820
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,260
he protects them from the dean.

821
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,060
That make sense?

822
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,920
Boiler alert.

823
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,221
Okay,

824
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,740
but I know how dare you.

825
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:54,810
Yeah.

826
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,910
My head to tell you a Khan Kang
is in the movie the entire time.

827
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,270
Who are the demon?

828
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,110
Some things that live in the hollow earth.

829
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,340
They live in the middle of the ground.

830
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,300
Round to those guys were like
a high fiving each other.

831
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,730
A hug them all the beer and said,

832
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:10,200
no,

833
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,470
no,

834
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,450
there's no ducking.

835
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,361
We'll kick.

836
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:15,070
Don't ever pull that shit on me.

837
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,550
Don't,

838
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,710
don't ever bring that
shit into my cage again.

839
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,330
Ah,

840
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,360
that's not a good situation.

841
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,960
That's what I say.

842
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,830
When guys try to wheel kick,

843
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:21,250
I go.

844
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,010
Don't ever bring that
shit into my cage again.

845
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,800
Do you ever have candidacies
that you use it to someone?

846
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,100
Yes,

847
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,381
I do.

848
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:28,570
Of course I do to.

849
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,760
But why did you ever wonder why?

850
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,630
Why would,

851
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,460
why would you even want
to say that to somebody?

852
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,350
Because I want to be cool.

853
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,400
The earth and everybody.

854
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:36,911
That's right.

855
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:40,000
But you gotta understand that
if you were that cool person,

856
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,260
you would not have said that.

857
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:42,561
I know that did,

858
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,980
but my fantasy is to do this.

859
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,671
I want to do this.

860
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:46,301
If he had done that,

861
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:46,901
I want to stop,

862
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:47,710
pull back and go,

863
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,280
oh,

864
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,630
you want a dance?

865
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,680
And then I come in with the,

866
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,523
with a fucking,

867
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,220
that's what I'm worried about with you.

868
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,070
It's like your mind thinks
the world is a movie,

869
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,680
like a really shot action star.

870
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,280
Yeah.

871
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,940
Yes,

872
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,773
that's right.

873
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,141
Yes.

874
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:02,530
Yes.

875
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,100
Adam Hunter told me he was in a fist
fight with someone once and as they were

876
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:06,320
like,

877
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,740
like getting ready to go at it.

878
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,280
He goes,

879
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,921
the guy he was,

880
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,770
it was a drunk dude and the dude was like,

881
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,930
tonight we dine in Hell.

882
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,823
Oh,

883
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,600
well that's embarrassing.

884
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,010
He really did say that.

885
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,180
Beat the shit out guys.

886
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,203
Spar.

887
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,140
Adam's a nice guy and I believe
that Adam was sober at the time.

888
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:26,411
So,

889
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:28,000
and Adam's a very good
wrestler by the way.

890
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,271
Yes,

891
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,400
he,

892
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,961
I'm pretty sure.

893
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,390
School wrestler wrestling
at the same high school.

894
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,960
I think what he did was just took
the guy down or held onto him.

895
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,181
I was like,

896
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,380
get this fucking guy away from

897
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,213
it's

898
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:41,983
tonight.

899
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,750
Hell the savage,

900
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,663
it's awesome.

901
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,670
Just thinks it's like a
movie wasn't in a movie.

902
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,220
He would still be ridiculous
even if it was run.

903
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,530
If I've never heard that before.

904
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,120
And some games we dine
in hell like damn you.

905
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,041
You run the risk of them.

906
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:58,251
Shit.

907
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:58,701
I'm not,

908
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:00,320
I would be saying keep talking stupid.

909
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,761
Keep talking.

910
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,680
The more you're talking more,

911
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:04,341
it's good bro.

912
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:05,560
Tonight we dine in Hell.

913
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:05,780
He know.

914
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,010
Yeah,

915
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,580
I would say yeah I
kicked your ass up that.

916
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:08,091
Tell me more.

917
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:08,760
Tell me more.

918
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,200
Oh,

919
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,690
make up some other shit
so you'll be distracted.

920
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:14,720
When I punched in the face I'd say Sony's
record this shit cause these are good

921
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,460
lines before we fight.

922
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,294
This shit is,

923
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,400
but I think the guy was just very
fortunate that I was a good guy.

924
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,930
Oh I'll leave here with a bag.

925
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,740
Alverez got his back here trying.

926
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,641
That's yeah,

927
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:28,911
that,

928
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,980
that was such a bitch.

929
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,283
It doesn't look good.

930
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,020
How do you get out of that?

931
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,993
He got did

932
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,400
and revenge for Olivera.

933
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,430
Oliver can be a little,

934
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,360
oh,

935
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,990
there we go.

936
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,111
Oh,

937
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:45,590
he's cool.

938
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,751
Oh,

939
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,440
they're good kids.

940
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,360
I like that.

941
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,100
That's cool.

942
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,933
That's cool.

943
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,003
Don't do that.

944
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:51,990
He goes,

945
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,340
get up.

946
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,791
Get up Bro.

947
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,330
Don't do that.

948
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,163
Please don't do that.

949
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,920
Those guys that like to do that.

950
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:58,750
Get on your knees,

951
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,290
kneeling shit in front of each other.

952
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,660
Some dudes just don't play.

953
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,860
Remember pat being cro cop help.

954
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:06,200
They would just hug hugging in
the middle of kick to the face.

955
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:06,930
Hug.

956
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,160
Yeah.

957
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,080
I fired.

958
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:08,781
That was weird.

959
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:09,830
Such a weird fight.

960
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:10,821
Yeah,

961
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:14,480
those and didn't Pat Barry like break
his hand like real early on in that fight

962
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:14,900
too?

963
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,141
Yeah,

964
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,190
and then got choked out.

965
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,601
They gave me cro,

966
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,200
cop and Josie.

967
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,711
What comes up to me?

968
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:18,891
He goes,

969
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:21,460
you better not fucking Pat Barry
and show him too much love.

970
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,293
I was like,

971
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,810
try my best.

972
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,280
I'll try my best.

973
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,170
Sir did take it back with the trip.

974
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,570
Very nice trip.

975
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,940
That's a big win for all of air
after losing in a fucked up way.

976
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,490
Because before he lost with that knee,

977
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,290
before that the fight was stopped.

978
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,610
He was getting tuned up.

979
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,983
Huge.

980
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,140
Everybody get out of a body triangle.

981
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,250
How do you do the time?

982
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,830
Do you lean towards the
side that it's locked up on?

983
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,180
It puts pressure on the ankle.

984
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,450
There's ways if you have good
dexterity that you can clear the leg,

985
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,381
you gotta,

986
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:52,430
you gotta know how to do it.

987
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,430
You've got to know how to put your
weight down and angle your hips down.

988
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:55,941
And it takes,

989
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:56,240
it's,

990
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,280
it's a slow process to
open up that triangle.

991
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,133
Guys can do it,

992
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,470
but when you're going to in the face,

993
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,400
every time I reach for that,

994
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,790
well it's the worst is when a guy who's
got your belly down belly down with that

995
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,391
body triangle,

996
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,800
it feels like your back's gonna break.

997
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,180
It's so much pressure.

998
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,310
That's three in a row for a cub with,

999
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:10,760
cause that's,

1000
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,660
that's not a loss.

1001
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,010
The,

1002
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,843
the last one,

1003
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,840
that's three in a row for homeboy.

1004
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,170
Boy,

1005
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,003
he's jacked.

1006
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:16,990
Marvel.

1007
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,071
Oh,

1008
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:17,811
there's a new marvel.

1009
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,040
Thank God it's a fury.

1010
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,461
What?

1011
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:19,860
Come on.

1012
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,693
It's on Netflix.

1013
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,390
Yeah.

1014
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,970
Dude was just the Kung Fu guy.

1015
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,470
Trains to watch this.

1016
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,550
Read this comic book or
I'm never heard of it.

1017
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,361
It's terrible.

1018
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,530
It's going to be the worst one ever.

1019
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,030
It was ridiculous hair,

1020
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,680
whatever hammered that daredevil one.

1021
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,360
Is that still around the series?

1022
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:35,850
I think so.

1023
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,190
I think that's pretty well done then.

1024
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,270
That's a Netflix one two,

1025
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:39,104
right?

1026
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,591
Damn,

1027
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:40,100
he's got,

1028
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,230
he's got a fast flash.

1029
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,070
I watched Dr. Strange other day.

1030
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,993
I heard it's good.

1031
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,113
Some bad,

1032
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,490
some bad doctor.

1033
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:47,941
Strange.

1034
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,710
I was a big fan of it when I was a kid,

1035
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,360
so for me it was like,

1036
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:51,781
wow,

1037
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:56,781
this is cool to see them like do their
take on the story with all a new special

1038
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:57,870
effects.

1039
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,920
I heard that Logan movies,

1040
00:26:58,921 --> 00:26:59,390
the shit.

1041
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,821
Me Too.

1042
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:00,654
I heard it so far.

1043
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,570
The Best Superhero movie.

1044
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,080
I saw it.

1045
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,950
Didn't you love it Jamie?

1046
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,740
It's really good.

1047
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,330
Yeah.

1048
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:05,700
Yeah.

1049
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,061
Hey Man.

1050
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:06,894
No more

1051
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,260
violence.

1052
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,030
Be Shot with the throwing stars on his,

1053
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:16,230
on his jackets up dog.

1054
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,064
Don't be scared.

1055
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,470
Shooty shooty kin.

1056
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,670
Impressive.

1057
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,140
Thanks for stars are underrated,

1058
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:22,351
man.

1059
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:23,280
I carried them all the time,

1060
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:23,911
dude.

1061
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:24,744
I do.

1062
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,310
Y'All want to see Logan though?

1063
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,630
Let me look because I heard it's really,

1064
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:28,400
really good.

1065
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:28,730
Yeah,

1066
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,040
they're so,

1067
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,491
so good.

1068
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,211
It's like one of those movies.

1069
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,890
You know how like dead
pulls up for an award.

1070
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:35,040
That's how Logan supposed to be
King Kong is going to beat it.

1071
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,180
I'm always down for King Kong,

1072
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:39,630
man,

1073
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,463
King Kong,

1074
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,813
King Kong

1075
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,290
called Kong or come out
of my paying attention.

1076
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,030
Khan,

1077
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,820
Kailyn g,

1078
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,010
but you know what the problem is
like whenever he gets in a fight with

1079
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:50,730
something,

1080
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,010
you know he's not going to
get killed by some monster.

1081
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,630
Like there's zero drama.

1082
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,561
It's always like,

1083
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:55,801
okay,

1084
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:56,634
how's this going to play out?

1085
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,320
When is King Kong get to fuck him up?

1086
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,490
Because it's going to happen.

1087
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm not going to let this demon monster
thing beat up King Kong and King Kong's

1088
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,380
fucking movie.

1089
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,591
Now.

1090
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:05,700
That would be a movie,

1091
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,001
right?

1092
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,300
That's a good movie right there.

1093
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,473
Twist.

1094
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,190
That's really bad demons
and not that stupid guys.

1095
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,010
He dies like with 15
minutes left in the movie.

1096
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:15,010
Just get you off guard.

1097
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,080
Subtle movie where he gets a virus and
he's got a call called ne dice quiet or

1098
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,660
he dies right away.

1099
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,320
But then the rest of the movie
is like going back in time.

1100
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,600
What do you think if they think
by making King Kong this big,

1101
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,850
that trying to set up a King
Kong versus Godzilla movie?

1102
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,743
Oh that's happening.

1103
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,053
It's already happened.

1104
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,200
It happened back in the
either making it now.

1105
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,560
Well then they'll throw some of the
vendors in there and shit because now King

1106
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,060
Kong is as big as Godzilla.

1107
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,270
Like this new King Kong is as big
as gods and I don't like that.

1108
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:49,530
Let's live a little more real.

1109
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,940
Giant ape would have an advantage of
our giant lizard because the lizard

1110
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,950
basically I get got its claws.

1111
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,330
But tonight as taxi breeds,

1112
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,540
oh he does,

1113
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:03,230
doesn't he believes he breathes
fire Seabreeze fucking fire.

1114
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,531
Oh,

1115
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:07,800
you're not 33 to 2017 look at the
difference between all the King Kong's.

1116
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,701
See I'm a fan of that.

1117
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:09,830
76 Kong,

1118
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,470
not Kong Congress two smalls,

1119
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,450
1967 that must be the Japanese version.

1120
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:15,571
Yeah,

1121
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:16,470
that's what I'm talking about.

1122
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,531
Yeah.

1123
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:19,170
So the original King Kong
was only 18 feet tall.

1124
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,420
That's not the tile.

1125
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,270
So the neutral ones thick.

1126
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,680
But the Kong skull island is huge.

1127
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,150
He's a hundred feet tall.

1128
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,110
That's bullshit.

1129
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,471
Well,

1130
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:29,280
how big is he?

1131
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,540
Is that skull island one?

1132
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,540
So he's a hundred feet tall
and Jack Black is only helpful.

1133
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,570
He was 150 148 feet tall and King Kong
versus Godzilla and 62 in Japan simply to

1134
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:41,650
obey one 40 is huge,

1135
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,380
but isn't Godzilla 500 feet tall?

1136
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,573
I don't know.

1137
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,310
I felt like God's really
hide if he is anyway.

1138
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,570
Do that guy really got Dylan
movie p Diddy Cranston.

1139
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,311
Pete did.

1140
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:54,730
He was in it.

1141
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:54,851
No,

1142
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:55,161
he did.

1143
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,230
He sang the theme song.

1144
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,980
Oh yeah,

1145
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,330
that was [inaudible] know it was bad.

1146
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,500
That's definitely not good.

1147
00:29:59,530 --> 00:29:59,711
Yeah.

1148
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:01,050
Look how big God's will is.

1149
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,481
Oh,

1150
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:02,530
Godzilla started off.

1151
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:03,880
He was only 50 meters high,

1152
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:05,110
so he's a hundred what is that?

1153
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,490
That's 150 feet.

1154
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,383
I like my God,

1155
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,470
50 meters high.

1156
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,493
I thought that's what you mean.

1157
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,350
But there's like a little bit more.

1158
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,280
How do you do meters?

1159
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:17,281
I think it's like 3.3 3.333 foot
0.3 inches or something to them.

1160
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,620
Yeah.

1161
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,020
You like to compare it to yards.

1162
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:21,660
There's like some simple way of doing it.

1163
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,900
Like it's like 50 meters
is like 55 yards I think.

1164
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,280
I think that's up to 14
fucking real similar.

1165
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:30,761
Yeah.

1166
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:33,010
So the 2014 God's was the biggest one.

1167
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,600
That was the Bryan Cranston Godzilla.

1168
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,400
The old one wasn't even that big.

1169
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,050
I like all the latest one.

1170
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:39,040
The latest one was good.

1171
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,140
If Saul,

1172
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,973
he doesn't,

1173
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,250
he doesn't fly here,

1174
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,111
but he lives in the ocean.

1175
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,330
Dude always listened to you.

1176
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:46,210
Oh shit man.

1177
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,843
He's

1178
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,011
86,

1179
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:53,200
two nine one seven eight a lot of uh,

1180
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,070
nuclear waste.

1181
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:54,221
Yeah.

1182
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:55,660
He came out of the ocean.

1183
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,920
And what was because of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

1184
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:02,140
those bombs that we dropped on Japan,

1185
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,820
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1186
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,170
That's why those monsters came out of
there and they were all about radiation.

1187
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:11,860
Mothra camera take sides.

1188
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,930
Of course those people were terrified.

1189
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,590
Next weekend.

1190
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,720
Manoa versus Anderson.

1191
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,070
Oh Shit.

1192
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:21,431
Oh,

1193
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:22,470
that's my birthday son.

1194
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:24,520
March 18th what are you
doing on your birthday?

1195
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:24,820
Man.

1196
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,960
Absolutely nothing.

1197
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,570
You not a big birthday celebration
and hope don't give up.

1198
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,910
Do you want to do a fight
companion and your birthday?

1199
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:31,811
That would be fun.

1200
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:32,050
Huh?

1201
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,883
That's sad too.

1202
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:33,940
That's it.

1203
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,773
Two o'clock here,

1204
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,860
Pearl afternoon.

1205
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,170
Perfect companion.

1206
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,330
Saturday 2:00 PM at a
union town this Saturday.

00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,950
Next Saturday.

1208
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,920
This next common one.

1209
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,470
Marching coming up March 18th.

1210
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,840
That's my son's birthday party.

1211
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,040
Uh,

1212
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,660
your son's born on March 18th,

1213
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,410
16.

1214
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,131
I'm on the 18th.

1215
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:55,330
Well shout out to Pisces.

1216
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,350
Powerful Pisces.

1217
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:56,880
Do you,

1218
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,350
do you follow all the astrology shit?

1219
00:31:59,380 --> 00:31:59,981
My mom did.

1220
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:02,410
So I grew up knowing what
does it mean anything to you?

1221
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,160
Like do you,

1222
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,590
do you identify with being
a Pisces as it makes sense?

1223
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,000
He's like,

1224
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,380
sometimes that's me a
little bit and it weird.

1225
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,810
People think it's bullshit.

1226
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,860
I don't know.

1227
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,671
You know what's,

1228
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:17,080
what's shocking to me about it is how
intricate it is when you look at all the

1229
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:19,870
things they take into consideration
when they try to like assess your

1230
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,540
personality or what you
are like based on your,

1231
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,310
you know,

1232
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,570
you know where Mercury's in retrograde,

1233
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:27,404
you put all the fucking,

1234
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,990
what time of the day was it?

1235
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,810
You meet a Scorpion,

1236
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,281
she's girl.

1237
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:35,260
She afraid she was freaking the shit
and my experience has my scorpions or be

1238
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:36,400
swept into Scorpio.

1239
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,320
It's weird about the astrology
thing is that there's 12 signs,

1240
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:39,700
right?

1241
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:39,980
Yeah.

1242
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,140
And in music there's 12 notes,

1243
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:42,830
right?

1244
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,700
Look at the show in here.

1245
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,830
The [inaudible] at 19 Yup.

1246
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,290
When he fought trade
Teledyne John McCarthy.

1247
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,133
Oh,

1248
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,190
that was him against van underlay.

1249
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,690
So gangster dude,

1250
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,960
look at the explosion.

1251
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,291
Oh,

1252
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,081
he was the fiend.

1253
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,090
He was phenomenal.

1254
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,620
He was phenomenal.

1255
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,183
One of the greats.

1256
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,653
No doubt.

1257
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,493
Mount Rushmore.

1258
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,493
Okay.

1259
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:04,911
Yeah.

1260
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,420
When you think about like who he
was when he first started man,

1261
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,580
until Randy coture beat him down.

1262
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,300
Yeah.

1263
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,080
And then everybody was like,

1264
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,431
oh man,

1265
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:13,264
he fought,

1266
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,190
I think he was literally 235 pounds.

1267
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,060
He was at least that.

1268
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,380
Yeah,

1269
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,430
it might've been two 42.

1270
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:19,490
I've never seen traps like that.

1271
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:19,910
Miami.

1272
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,350
Have you heard the story about a sister?

1273
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:21,871
No.

1274
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:22,850
Sister was killed,

1275
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:23,220
man.

1276
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,290
Not just killed the,

1277
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:24,690
they,

1278
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,590
they did that thing supposedly
that they do where they,

1279
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,920
they light you up on fire inside tires.

1280
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,570
Cartel Shit.

1281
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:32,871
Yeah.

1282
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:34,130
They still think they call it,

1283
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:34,420
um,

1284
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,450
that kind of eat microwaving
or something like that done.

1285
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,590
You don't get over that.

1286
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,500
That's when he got,

1287
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:39,711
yeah,

1288
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:40,161
that was,

1289
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:40,761
that's a beast.

1290
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:41,780
That's how I get rid of the body.

1291
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,440
Yeah,

1292
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,273
exactly.

1293
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,660
They put you inside.

1294
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,600
He hires and they a ransom
or something from him.

1295
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,080
Yeah.

1296
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,610
Yeah.

1297
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,270
And then they couldn't
find her horrible story,

1298
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:50,740
man.

1299
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,650
It's scary shit,

1300
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:52,100
dude.

1301
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,990
There's some evil fucks in this world.

1302
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,913
Yup.

1303
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,360
Super Scary.

1304
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:56,631
Yeah.

1305
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:58,310
So he had to recover from all that.

1306
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,510
That took a long time.

1307
00:33:59,550 --> 00:33:59,811
Then he,

1308
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:00,980
when he went over to pride,

1309
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:02,270
he really wasn't the same guy,

1310
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,501
you know,

1311
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,610
gross hair out had like that wet Joe
curl and then it came back to the UFC and

1312
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:10,460
had some fights where
he looks sensational,

1313
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,323
you know,

1314
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,591
stories like that.

1315
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:15,980
And they ruin literally my fucking day,

1316
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,430
you know?

1317
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:16,641
Yeah.

1318
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:18,760
It's hard to know that
people are capable of that.

1319
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,500
Right?

1320
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,333
It's hard to,

1321
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,161
you know,

1322
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:21,994
it's happening.

1323
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,100
That's happening almost
every day in the Middle East.

1324
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:25,281
I mean,

1325
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:25,880
people,

1326
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,840
people getting blown up,

1327
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:27,674
civilians,

1328
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,833
Mexico.

1329
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,180
Whereas whereas going on all
over the place of right now,

1330
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:33,290
people are being blown up.

1331
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:33,531
Dude,

1332
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,310
I saw a kid,

1333
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,450
whereas I saw a family when I was at
Disney and wearing a El Chapo shirts.

1334
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:38,811
I was like,

1335
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:40,160
you fucking morons.

1336
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,930
You realize what that stands for?

1337
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,070
What are you thinking?

1338
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:48,080
So fuck you guys thinking that's so
crazy that they think it's spot on.

1339
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,953
Funnel cakes.

1340
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,180
Did you know?

1341
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,330
I want to fucking throw it
down their faces so mad.

1342
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,510
It's ridic.

1343
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,490
How weird is that?

1344
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,340
It is your base serial killers shirt.

1345
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,640
You want a Bundy while I'll go get you
a fucking Ted Bundy one if you want.

1346
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,540
As long as you don't know anybody
that got killed by the guy though.

1347
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,820
There's something about those
people that's very attractive to us.

1348
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:12,821
When we see a Tony Soprano on TV or
you see any kind of a gang kingpin type

1349
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:13,850
character,

1350
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,330
as long as you're not directly affected
by his evil deeds or something that's

1351
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:18,170
attractive about,

1352
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:19,070
we'll look at narcos.

1353
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,731
Narcos,

1354
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:20,930
we like damn fuck out.

1355
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,310
He's kind of pretty cool man.

1356
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,110
I feel bad for what he was going to die.

1357
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,720
Good Dad.

1358
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,170
Yeah.

1359
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,160
It's weird man.

1360
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,660
It's a weird thing that he's a murderer,

1361
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,340
but we like we're rooting for him.

1362
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeah.

1363
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,990
Blowing up planes.

1364
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,681
That's thinking about,

1365
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:33,891
you know,

1366
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:35,060
what talent do you think?

1367
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:39,900
Do you think a El Chapo as is bringing
in more drugs into the country.

1368
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,190
Then like our own government,

1369
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,150
our own governments doing it and we're
claiming war on drugs and we're bringing

1370
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:45,600
it in,

1371
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,400
bringing in more than the cartels are.

1372
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:47,681
Well,

1373
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,020
they're doing it in a legal way.

1374
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,183
That's why,

1375
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,600
that's why the Afghanistan
thing is so bizarre.

1376
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,910
Not Killing families and stuff.

1377
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,780
When you find out how much they've ramped
up heroin production in Afghanistan,

1378
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,490
if you don't think a few
people have died for that,

1379
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,060
you're crazy when bombs are
being dropped on a daily basis.

1380
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,851
That's,

1381
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:04,441
that's just,

1382
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:06,180
that's El Chapo Shit right there for you,

1383
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,170
but they can hide that.

1384
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,960
They can hide the,

1385
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,020
the Afghanistan heroin trade thing.

1386
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,790
They can hide it right in
front of everybody's face.

1387
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,110
That's what's really crazy.

1388
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,480
What's really crazy
about the Afghan ha ha.

1389
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,250
It's all like the paper,

1390
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,660
like the actual paper trails.

1391
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,620
Undeniable.

1392
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:20,520
There's video of,

1393
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:21,031
I think,

1394
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:21,751
I don't know who it is.

1395
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,870
Maybe Geraldo Rivera.

1396
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,040
He's standing in front
of us in the Middle East.

1397
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:29,790
He's standing in front of a
poppy plantation and there's,

1398
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,340
there's military guys like Guardian,

1399
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,870
and they say that the guarding it
because it's the weirdest excuse.

1400
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:37,101
Everett,

1401
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:37,934
what guardian?

1402
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,680
We're protecting these poppy
seeds because if we don't,

1403
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,130
then alcaide is going to come in and
then use it and sell it to fund their

1404
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:47,371
operations,

1405
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,530
so we got to make sure
they don't get ahold of it.

1406
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,860
Did you see,

1407
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,680
do you remember when Robert got to fire?

1408
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,540
He was live on CNN and he's like,

1409
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,370
dot.

1410
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,230
We're doing a secret mission here.

1411
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,090
We're located and draws into the sand.

1412
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,331
He's like,

1413
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,460
our mission is to go here and there,

1414
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:04,470
like you fucking moron.

1415
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,860
Everyone's going to see this knee up
fired literally like the next day cause he

1416
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:08,250
gave up,

1417
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,280
they gave him like inside access
and he drew it in the sand.

1418
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,233
What they're playing.

1419
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,373
God,

1420
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,820
he's a foolish man.

1421
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,780
Hilarious though.

1422
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,360
You remember when you opened up Al
Capone's vault and there wasn't shit in

1423
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,080
there?

1424
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,913
No,

1425
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,540
no big news event.

1426
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,560
It was live on TV.

1427
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:23,760
We all sat around and watched.

1428
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,070
He don't know.

1429
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,003
That's crazy.

1430
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,301
Oh Man.

1431
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:30,890
I want to say like 90
10 [inaudible] in there.

1432
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,100
[inaudible] 96,

1433
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,390
30 million people watching

1434
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,120
people watch nothing.

1435
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,470
So he ended up it up.

1436
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,711
Yeah,

1437
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:38,221
they open it up.

1438
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,770
There wasn't shit in zero.

1439
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,060
It was a long way.

1440
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:42,870
Jokes.

1441
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,040
I mean it was like every news,

1442
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,200
every uh,

1443
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,560
uh,

1444
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,290
late night guy on TV was
making jokes about it.

1445
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,030
Everyone had jokes
about al Capone's vault.

1446
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:52,410
They will ask it for years.

1447
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,630
Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone's vault.

1448
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,121
Yeah.

1449
00:37:57,121 --> 00:38:02,100
You opened it up and taken nothing but
he's also the guy live from Chicago.

1450
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:02,880
We're going to open it,

1451
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,421
watch this.

1452
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:04,254
Boom.

1453
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,140
They got the things falls
dam and they opened it.

1454
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:07,974
Yeah.

1455
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,820
Look,

1456
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,160
he took a chance with dramatic flare,

1457
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:13,890
a chance and it didn't really pay off.

1458
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,690
But if it did well now he has
to kill time and share it.

1459
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,270
I mean he's got nothing in there,

1460
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:21,780
God,

1461
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,750
but he's also the guy that had um,

1462
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:28,790
Dick Gregory actually on his television
show debuted the Zapruder film,

1463
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,040
which is the shot of Kennedy's head
getting blown off and going back into the

1464
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,030
left classic and in what looks
like a shot from the front,

1465
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,680
it looks like a frontal shot.

1466
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,600
It looks like he was actually shot
by more than one person if the,

1467
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,370
like if you look at,

1468
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,850
there's various interpretations
of the Zapruder film,

1469
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,730
but one interpretation that
seems to make a lot of sense.

1470
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:51,931
He's,

1471
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:55,240
that he was hit from both the
front and the back to he was,

1472
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:57,190
there was multiple
people shooting at them.

1473
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,830
And if you talk to
anyone who is trying to,

1474
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,510
if you were looked at that pinch point,

1475
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,360
like as they make that
corner in Dealey Plaza,

1476
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,111
like they were like,

1477
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:07,750
well you wouldn't just
have one guy with a rifle.

1478
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,640
You would make sure you were
shooting at them from a,

1479
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,320
from a bunch of different locations and
Geraldo dropped revenues and Geraldo

1480
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,210
showed the video.

1481
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,301
Hold on a second.

1482
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:17,200
Here's what's important.

1483
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,910
That video was many years
after Kennedy's assassination.

1484
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,420
Yeah,

1485
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,440
like a decade.

1486
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,600
So for a decade we had all thought that
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and there

1487
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:30,400
was only a few people
that didn't think he did,

1488
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,920
but there was no visual evidence
that showed differently.

1489
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,381
Hey Lee,

1490
00:39:33,381 --> 00:39:33,761
for sure.

1491
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,260
Tell us.

1492
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,093
Haji,

1493
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,673
prude feminist,

1494
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,720
it's,

1495
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,690
it always baffled me that
when you see him get hit,

1496
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,060
it looks like for a couple of
frames it looks like his head,

1497
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,590
half his head disappears and
there's just a purple Blob,

1498
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,480
like it's a purple blob.

1499
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,000
But then when you look at
the op to autopsy pictures,

1500
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,910
it's just a hole in his head
and he just laying there.

1501
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,990
But it looks on this,

1502
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,260
it looks like it blew it
all was tampered with.

1503
00:39:59,290 --> 00:39:59,950
That's what it looks.

1504
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,600
Well it doesn't look like
the film was tampered with,

1505
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:04,480
but the autopsy photographs
were most likely tampered with.

1506
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,500
And this was a big part of the contention
that David Liftin had when he wrote

1507
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:11,140
the book best evidence
because there's two different,

1508
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,090
let's watch this.

1509
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,530
We'll see like a perpetual offer.

1510
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,620
Two frames doesn't make any sense.

1511
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,170
Spray the bullets,

1512
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:18,004
hitting his head,

1513
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,850
his heads.

1514
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,110
When you hit something with a bullet,

1515
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:20,980
there's a spray.

1516
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,050
It looks like his,

1517
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,520
his whole face just flies
off and they're just,

1518
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:24,611
well,

1519
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:25,361
they say that his,

1520
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:30,361
his peace of his head flew off and she
crawled to on the back to try to put his

1521
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:32,620
head back to which is
a human being to know.

1522
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:33,570
She didn't know she did.

1523
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:34,760
No,

1524
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,593
did not say that.

1525
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,000
That's not what happened.

1526
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,640
She was trying to get the fuck out
of that limousine because people were

1527
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:41,650
shooting and they blew
her husband's head off.

1528
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:43,210
She wasn't going for any piece of meat.

1529
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,770
I heard that now she was reaching,

1530
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,800
people say crazy shit like that does not.

1531
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,890
She was getting the fuck.

1532
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,410
Did she ever talk about
Barbara talked about it.

1533
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:53,571
I go,

1534
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:53,831
oh,

1535
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,990
she never talked to him for,

1536
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,483
you know,

1537
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,110
Jackie Onassis right afterwards.

1538
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:01,300
She married like one of the
richest people she could find.

1539
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,140
But don't you think
with that autopsy they,

1540
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,480
they,

1541
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,530
it's your president that
just got assassinated.

1542
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:08,010
So you're going to want to make
him look the best politics.

1543
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,880
Look at the video,

1544
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,781
the supporter for him.

1545
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:11,171
What does that mean?

1546
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:11,581
Explain,

1547
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:12,610
cause this is something that I'm really,

1548
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,420
I've read different books on this shit
and I've watched 10 or 15 documentaries.

1549
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,771
Yeah.

1550
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:17,951
Well,

1551
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:21,910
one of the big things is there's a giant
difference between the account of the

1552
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:22,744
autopsy,

1553
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,280
what,

1554
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,220
what they said,

1555
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,330
their description of the body and the
wounds in Dallas versus their description

1556
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:29,410
and the wounds in Bethesda,

1557
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:29,950
Maryland,

1558
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,510
two very different autopsies.

1559
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,230
One of them that shows an entrance wound
on the neck shows he got shot from the

1560
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:40,460
front and an exit wound or an entrance
wound on his neck on another one that was

1561
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,500
changed to a tracheotomy scar.

1562
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,000
So there's a discrepancy.

1563
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,290
He grabs his neck,

1564
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,460
it like he got hit,

1565
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,010
he holds his neck maybe a second
or two before his brain's blowout.

1566
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,600
Right.

1567
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,110
And when he's holding his
neck like this on one autopsy,

1568
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,670
on one account of the body,

1569
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:57,080
that's an entrance wound from a bullet.

1570
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,340
That's the Dallas one.

1571
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,510
But on another one,

1572
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,380
see if you see him when he's
going around the corner here,

1573
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,260
he's already holding his neck.

1574
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,110
Look at how he's holding
his neck like that.

1575
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:10,790
He reached up and grabbed himself and
he's looking down and ride around.

1576
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,040
He passes the pole and his head blows off.

1577
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,810
Watch this right here.

1578
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,453
Boom.

1579
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,043
What else?

1580
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:19,610
Hang on.

1581
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,150
Start again.

1582
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,780
Oh No,

1583
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:20,871
no,

1584
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,011
no,

1585
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:21,131
no,

1586
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:21,201
no,

1587
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:21,490
no.

1588
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:21,590
Yeah,

1589
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,580
it'd be good to get out the way.

1590
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,850
This isn't super slowly

1591
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:26,961
disappears,

1592
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,141
right?

1593
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:27,441
They're like,

1594
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:27,861
what is that?

1595
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:28,520
It's like a flower.

1596
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,950
It's just a flap of bone and
meet it opened his headlight out.

1597
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,910
So watch,

1598
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:33,111
look,

1599
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:36,830
she ain't go in searching for a piece
of hair and she's trying to get the fuck

1600
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:37,550
off of that.

1601
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:37,701
Well,

1602
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:41,590
we don't know when the
service guy right behind you,

1603
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,110
bro,

1604
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,510
that's the secret service guy has climbed
up at the back of the car and he's

1605
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:45,530
reaching for her to help her.

1606
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,150
Oh my God,

1607
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,043
what a horrible,

1608
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,100
so,

1609
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,270
but the problem was nobody had seen that
until 10 years after the assassination.

1610
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:54,200
So when they watch it,

1611
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:54,381
they go,

1612
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:54,681
oh my God,

1613
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:56,390
his head goes back into the left.

1614
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,170
That was like that Hicks joke that he
kept talking about backing to the left,

1615
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,130
back into the left.

1616
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,271
I mean his,

1617
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,230
he got shot,

1618
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:06,500
it looked like he was getting shot from
the front and it hit the right side of

1619
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,090
his head and his head
goes back into the left.

1620
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,410
But there's also some spray that
appears to be either going forward,

1621
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:15,020
it could be an impact spray
or the bullet from the front,

1622
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,950
or it could be that he got shot with
two different bullets at the same time.

1623
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,581
There's,

1624
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:20,150
there's,

1625
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,391
there's,

1626
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:23,150
it's very possible that he got
hit from the front and the back.

1627
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,690
[inaudible] it's basically very hard
to tell what happened with one angle.

1628
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:27,080
Right.

1629
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,261
Well,

1630
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:28,790
you know for sure he got shot in the head.

1631
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,220
His head blew apart.

1632
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,800
What's crazy to me after all these years,

1633
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,000
we don't know for a fact.

1634
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,481
No,

1635
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:36,050
they can't.

1636
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,800
There's no way they can know
that came out and watch it again.

1637
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,461
Watch this again.

1638
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:41,090
Now Watch,

1639
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:41,450
watch.

1640
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,680
It's hard to tell if this is an
impact spray or if it's an exit.

1641
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,573
Where's his head at?

1642
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,600
His head is right there.

1643
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:48,800
It's like an impact right there.

1644
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:49,130
Hey Man.

1645
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:49,970
But could be,

1646
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,460
it could be an impact
spray from the front.

1647
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,490
Meanwhile it,

1648
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,340
it very well could be that
it's an exit spray too.

1649
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,030
But the thing is his head
goes back into the left.

1650
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,440
But here's the question.

1651
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,920
Does it go back to the left from the
momentum of getting hit in the head with a

1652
00:44:06,921 --> 00:44:11,270
bullet or is it a spasm
from a dying body like your,

1653
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:14,630
your body locks up and it just
throws itself into a convulsion.

1654
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,920
That's possible too.

1655
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,670
I mean a lot of crazy shit happens
when you get shot in the fucking head.

1656
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,830
And he was a real cocksman too.

1657
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,730
I bet he was.

1658
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,340
But I don't think that had anything cause
you don't think I'm just saying to be

1659
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:27,050
Harvey Oswald acted alone.

1660
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,510
I do not think Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone.

1661
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,170
I do not.

1662
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,500
I do not think that even,

1663
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,280
uh,

1664
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,650
even reasonable to assume
that he acted alone.

1665
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,791
There's way,

1666
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,490
way too many people that invest
in interest in killing him.

1667
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,600
Like a Cubans,

1668
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,400
like every,

1669
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,520
there was a lot of people,

1670
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,680
there was a lot of people
that wanted him dead.

1671
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,780
And it depends on what varying version
of the story you're willing to buy into.

1672
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:50,580
But what is possible,

1673
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,620
and this is one thing that
people don't want to consider,

1674
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:56,580
they think either Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone or at some wacky tinfoil hat

1675
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:57,414
conspiracy.

1676
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,530
I say neither.

1677
00:44:58,531 --> 00:44:59,850
I say it might be both.

1678
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,130
I say Lee Harvey Oswald
could have been in on it.

1679
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:02,964
He seemed like a,

1680
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,610
like a gullible guy and a lot of ways.

1681
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,270
Right.

1682
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,103
He'd been to Russia.

1683
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,831
You've been rushed too,

1684
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:08,690
but he lived in Russia.

1685
00:45:08,691 --> 00:45:09,810
He's married to a Russian woman,

1686
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:14,280
Lee Harvey Oswald was most certainly
at least in cahoots with the FBI.

1687
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,360
He definitely,

1688
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,440
yes,

1689
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:16,650
he,

1690
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:16,801
well,

1691
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:19,800
he definitely did some things
for other organizations.

1692
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,580
Uh,

1693
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,100
and brought over during the Cold War.

1694
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,840
A Russian wife lived over in Russia and
then got back in the United States and

1695
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:28,674
brought over as Russia.

1696
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,730
We did also going to Cuba,

1697
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:29,971
right?

1698
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:31,390
Didn't he spent time in Cuba believe?

1699
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,221
I believe he did.

1700
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:32,461
I don't,

1701
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:33,091
I don't remember that.

1702
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:34,590
But I know for a fact he lived in Russia.

1703
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,960
Communist spoke Russian,

1704
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:38,690
but he was part of a,

1705
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:39,840
a Cuban movement,

1706
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:41,450
like a liberty for Cuba.

1707
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:42,620
Cuba.

1708
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,770
I spent time in Cuba.

1709
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:44,604
Might have,

1710
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,110
he didn't go to Cuba.

1711
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,441
Okay,

1712
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:46,821
well Jamie,

1713
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:47,460
you'll find it.

1714
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:47,781
But the,

1715
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:51,600
but the bottom line is he easily could
have been working for the government and

1716
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:54,840
he easily could have been a part of the
plan and he easily could have been a guy

1717
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,350
that they fell maybe was,

1718
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,000
yeah,

1719
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,900
they set him up.

1720
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:58,800
Is he still alive?

1721
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,291
No,

1722
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:03,510
we got shot by Jack Ruby like a couple
days after he shot Kennedy or allegedly

1723
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,344
shot 10

1724
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,560
died of cancer in jail.

1725
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,341
Not only that,

1726
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:12,900
Jack Ruby was a mob guy that was deeply
beholden to all these different groups

1727
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:14,370
and you know,

1728
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:15,450
which is very weird.

1729
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:15,691
Right.

1730
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:15,891
Why?

1731
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:16,740
Why would Jack Ruby,

1732
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,540
a mob guy kill,

1733
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,770
can meet Harvey Oswald in broad
daylight while he's being escorted?

1734
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:23,161
Like what?

1735
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:24,020
What would they,

1736
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:24,391
they were like,

1737
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:24,541
well,

1738
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:25,710
he felt so bad for Jackie.

1739
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:26,730
That doesn't make any sense.

1740
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,860
The JFK story is vast.

1741
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,680
It would take you fucking 25 hours.

1742
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:35,970
People have written books on it.

1743
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:36,181
I mean,

1744
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:37,800
it's so deep.

1745
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,600
Everybody want JFK debt.

1746
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,930
The CII wanted them to get oh,

1747
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,380
MCS and in Cuba and so union,

1748
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,430
so he wasn't killing oil.

1749
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,470
One that everybody wanted him dead.

1750
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,180
So was trying to change the world.

1751
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,230
He visited embassies and Cuba and the
Soviet Union to plot his escape before

1752
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,430
assassinating John F.

1753
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:56,580
Kennedy.

1754
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,930
I think he was in on it.

1755
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:58,883
That's what I think.

1756
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,723
For sure.

1757
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:00,630
Yeah.

1758
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,520
Leo Oswald didn't act alone,

1759
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:06,060
but I do believe he was in on it and
I bet he didn't pull the trigger.

1760
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:08,610
I bet a bunch of other people
pull the trigger and a bet.

1761
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:09,090
Who's the,

1762
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,870
he was the guy they set up command.

1763
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,230
Yeah,

1764
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,890
because like Dallas,

1765
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,340
no,

1766
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,210
Howard hunt is,

1767
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,020
yes.

1768
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,141
He,

1769
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:18,420
Howard hunt was in the CIA.

1770
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,690
He was part of a Watergate.

1771
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,400
He's,

1772
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,860
he's very big in the CIA on his deathbed.

1773
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,753
He says that,

1774
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,540
uh,

1775
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,040
that was all the assassins from

1776
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,900
operation 40 operations.

1777
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:33,040
40 was a unit that,

1778
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,270
that um,

1779
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,940
they put together to
assassinate Fidel Castro,

1780
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:38,410
all these international killers.

1781
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:38,981
It's just like,

1782
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:39,460
uh,

1783
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,240
like the murder incorporated operation it,

1784
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:42,971
yeah,

1785
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:43,780
exactly.

1786
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,440
All these,

1787
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:44,711
these,

1788
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:44,980
uh,

1789
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,780
snipers and killers,

1790
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,023
uh,

1791
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,990
anti Castro,

1792
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,950
Cubans,

1793
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,701
you know,

1794
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:52,590
there were exiled.

1795
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,830
They all got together.

1796
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,390
They tried to kill Fidel Castro.

1797
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,770
Bay of Pigs failed.

1798
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,270
Um,

1799
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,103
uh,

1800
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,360
because JFK made,

1801
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,840
part of the reason was because,

1802
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:02,501
uh,

1803
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:03,490
JFK didn't,

1804
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,423
uh,

1805
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,343
um,

1806
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:05,801
he,

1807
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:06,430
uh,

1808
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,980
he didn't want any air support.

1809
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,430
He didn't want to be any part.

1810
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,810
He didn't want any part of Bay of pigs.

1811
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:13,900
So the CIA felt like they
got abandoned by JFK.

1812
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,810
JFK fires the head of the CIA.

1813
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,770
So right there there's a big
rift between the CIA and JFK.

1814
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,640
The mob hated JFK too,

1815
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,750
because they were supposed
to protect them up.

1816
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,400
Robert Kennedy and JFK,

1817
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,530
but because their dad was a mobster,

1818
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,180
so they thought they were
going to be protected.

1819
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:35,770
So the mom spent all this money to get
JFK n and then he's turning on him and,

1820
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,630
and Robert Kennedy's brother,

1821
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,860
he's the attorney general.

1822
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:40,000
He's going after the mob.

1823
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:40,391
So they're like,

1824
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:40,661
okay,

1825
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:41,650
we got to stop these months.

1826
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:42,730
So when you look,

1827
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,810
when you look really,

1828
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:44,501
really look into it,

1829
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:45,580
a lot of people wanted him dead.

1830
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,080
Big Oil wanted him dead.

1831
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,400
They killed them in Texas.

1832
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,200
Lyndon B Johnson,

1833
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,460
Lyndon B Johnson,

1834
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,880
the vice president was about
to be indicted for tumors.

1835
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,040
He had the,

1836
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,000
you know how uh,

1837
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,043
he stopped that.

1838
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,700
JFK got assassinated.

1839
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:01,511
He becomes president.

1840
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,650
He pardons himself.

1841
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,100
He was a crazy time,

1842
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,660
was not a lot on his deathbed.

1843
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,300
Said operation for the Bolivia,

1844
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,320
assassins for operations,

1845
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,840
40 were all there.

1846
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,640
They were all there to watch the,

1847
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,391
the big event.

1848
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,430
They all collaborate and
he says he's on his death.

1849
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:25,040
But here's even,

1850
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,990
he was there as a bomb.

1851
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:26,950
He was one of the bumps.

1852
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,000
We were all watching it.

1853
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,200
There's a photograph of him,

1854
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,360
there's a photograph
of him from the arrest.

1855
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,160
They arrested a bunch of Hobos.

1856
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:33,760
I said,

1857
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,160
getting off the top killers.

1858
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,250
They were all assassins.

1859
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,940
They were and they've identified
some of the guys who were on that,

1860
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,021
on that train.

1861
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:44,170
One of them was a fucking the the actor.

1862
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,310
The fuck's his name.

1863
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,450
Woody Harrelson.

1864
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:46,991
Harrelson.

1865
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:47,970
Where do you house his dad.

1866
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,560
His Dad was an assassin like legitimate,

1867
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,370
like crazy and so he,

1868
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:55,720
I would hunt on his death bed.

1869
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,380
You can watch this at
the library on you too.

1870
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,100
He said he was,

1871
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,870
he was bench warming.

1872
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,710
He was,

1873
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,660
there was a lot just in
case something went wrong.

1874
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,860
There was a bunch of people there.

1875
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:09,880
He was getting shot.

1876
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:14,410
He was getting lit up from all sorts
of the Hobos were undercover cops?

1877
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:15,520
No,

1878
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:15,681
no.

1879
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:16,620
The hobos were like,

1880
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,660
at least one of the Hobos has been
identified as a known so not just the hour

1881
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:22,661
time,

1882
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:25,240
but there's other guys that have like
people have broken down the photos of the

1883
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:27,800
Hobos and they said that
that this guy is that guy,

1884
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:27,980
this

1885
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,220
guy,

1886
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,790
an assassin.

1887
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,030
Like what they weigh it,

1888
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,560
it seems like they had done was they
had planned to kill Kennedy and they

1889
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:36,680
planned to do it in Dallas for some
reason and they brought in a bunch of

1890
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,520
different people to do it.

1891
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:39,200
Now here's where it gets really squirrely.

1892
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,950
When you find out how many people who are
witnesses who testified that they were

1893
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:47,150
there at the shooting wound up
dying and really fucked up ways.

1894
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,340
They wound up dying by murder.

1895
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,760
They wound up dying and
weird car accidents where
they're fucking break lines

1896
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:53,450
were cut.

1897
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,710
There was a ton of them.

1898
00:50:54,711 --> 00:50:56,150
So many of them that they,

1899
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,720
someone,

1900
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,250
I think it might've been lifting as well.

1901
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:00,500
David lifting the same guy
who wrote best evidence.

1902
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,940
They had some calculation on what the
odds are of all these people meeting

1903
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:08,660
violent demises inside of
two years and it was crazy,

1904
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:09,643
bro.

1905
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:12,350
See if you could find that
young Jamie from funnel.

1906
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:13,340
No.

1907
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,050
How many people see if the,

1908
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,500
the the amount of people who
witnessed the Kennedy assassination,

1909
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,840
who wound up dying under
mysterious circumstances.

1910
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:21,680
Crazy shit.

1911
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,690
Astronauts.

1912
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,710
Aliens to one.

1913
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,000
It's like a millions to one.

1914
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:29,300
Like if you look at how many people died
and what are the odds of them all like

1915
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,420
getting murdered or killed suicide.

1916
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,100
We are weird suicides,

1917
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:34,281
you know,

1918
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:36,770
like hang themselves
on a fucking coat rack.

1919
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,730
Like weird shit.

1920
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,121
Yeah,

1921
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:38,390
Jay,

1922
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,210
the JFK story is deep as fuck.

1923
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,040
They killed that guy,

1924
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:42,440
buddy.

1925
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,180
Everybody collaborated.

1926
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,010
They all agreed we need
to get rid of this guy.

1927
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:46,191
See,

1928
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:48,370
I'm surprised more guys as
they get older than them,

1929
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,190
their deathbed.

1930
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:49,910
Don't tell the truth.

1931
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:50,743
Nobody cares.

1932
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:51,801
Here's the thing.

1933
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:55,610
By then there is also plenty of
fake stories are they have to do.

1934
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,180
Look at it.

1935
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:56,511
Here we go.

1936
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:56,960
Here.

1937
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,220
Look at this 101,000 trillion to one.

1938
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,240
Some have claimed that a
large number of witness,

1939
00:52:03,241 --> 00:52:03,951
an event have died.

1940
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:06,980
Mysterious circumstances Sunday Times
reported that the odds against these

1941
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:10,100
witnesses being dead by February,

1942
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,370
1967 or 100,000 trillion to one whoa

1943
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,560
admitted he had made a careless
journalistic mistake in his book,

1944
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,420
a crossfire author Jim marrs
provides a list of 103 people.

1945
00:52:23,421 --> 00:52:27,470
He claims died in mysterious circumstances
between 63 and 76 in reality,

1946
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:29,300
most of these people
died of natural causes.

1947
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,790
Some of these people did die in accidents.

1948
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:33,560
Others were murdered or committed suicide.

1949
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:34,220
However,

1950
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,940
these people rarely had information that
would have been important in helping

1951
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,360
advance.

1952
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,450
That sounds like an editorialization.

1953
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,040
I want to know who's writing.

1954
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:43,671
I think about it.

1955
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:46,760
If you're going to pull off
an assassination and then
you're all going to go as

1956
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:47,091
a group,

1957
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:48,970
let's kill everybody
around there as a matter.

1958
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:49,830
That's hard to do.

1959
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:50,511
That doesn't matter.

1960
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:51,021
It doesn't matter.

1961
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:51,610
I don't have pain.

1962
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,311
I'm looking at that.

1963
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:52,860
Right?

1964
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,590
What I'm saying is what that guy wrote
is an editorialization like that might be

1965
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,131
correct,

1966
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,600
but it might be wrong too.

1967
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,440
He's making an assumption and he's writing
this guest based on that assumption.

1968
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:03,890
Wow.

1969
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,341
I mean,

1970
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:05,870
I don't know how you'd like,

1971
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:06,111
okay,

1972
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:07,700
so you've got all of those witnesses.

1973
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:08,511
That's how fucking,

1974
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:09,261
that's really hard.

1975
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:10,880
Now you've got to organize
all those markers.

1976
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,803
Good luck.

1977
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,480
All these different people
that were witnesses.

1978
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,111
Look at this.

1979
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:15,311
Good.

1980
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:16,101
Make that a little larger,

1981
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:16,401
Jamie.

1982
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,730
So I could read this shit like this.

1983
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,170
They all die pretty spaced out that a
lot of times they're talking to these,

1984
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:22,461
oh,

1985
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:23,820
these are all Kennedy's that were whacked.

1986
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,321
Yeah.

1987
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,154
Well everybody,

1988
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,741
the Kennedys,

1989
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:25,951
man,

1990
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:26,010
they

1991
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,220
were,

1992
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,480
they started out killing the game.

1993
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,370
So they start out as drug runners.

1994
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,990
They were running moonshine.

1995
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,831
That's how they started.

1996
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:32,664
That's where they made their money.

1997
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,960
Joe Deep.

1998
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,820
And then JFK and,

1999
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,510
and,

2000
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,320
and uh,

2001
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,250
the rest of his sons,

2002
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:40,230
they started trying to
change the world for real.

2003
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:41,064
And they're like,

2004
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,060
what do you mean happening?

2005
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,850
Everybody wanted JFK died.

2006
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,401
They knew.

2007
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:46,770
They joked around about how they knew.

2008
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,300
What they were trying to do is,

2009
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,020
you know,

2010
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,190
put their lives in jeopardy.

2011
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,120
You know what's really interesting,

2012
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:51,640
son?

2013
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,473
Robert's son,

2014
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,270
the way his son died on that plane.

2015
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:55,860
You look into that holy shot.

2016
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,880
That guy was coked up,

2017
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:57,121
man.

2018
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:58,440
He's coked up and didn't
know what he was doing.

2019
00:53:58,441 --> 00:53:59,880
He was driving into the fog.

2020
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,080
You have to be really look good.

2021
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:01,840
You got to look into,

2022
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,670
I did.

2023
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,410
Did you really?

2024
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,710
What do you think that he died?

2025
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,630
He died with cocaine in his system and
he didn't know how to drive the plot of

2026
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,473
shady shit.

2027
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,020
People,

2028
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,560
people crash body,

2029
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:11,791
they found a plain,

2030
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:15,220
they found his body when people
have Rekesh over a hundred murder,

2031
00:54:15,221 --> 00:54:17,100
suicides and mysterious deaths.

2032
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,270
The strange fate of those who
saw Kennedy shot for sure live,

2033
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,133
he saw it.

2034
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:22,741
See,

2035
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:23,400
I'd have to,

2036
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,410
I'd have to read all
these pretty organized.

2037
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:27,050
He's killed by a karate chop.

2038
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,661
What's coming out?

2039
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:28,051
Sign out.

2040
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:28,681
I'm a patsy.

2041
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:29,281
I'm a patsy.

2042
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:30,420
I'm being set up pop,

2043
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:30,571
pop,

2044
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:31,404
pop,

2045
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,340
and then Jack Ruby shoots him on TV
and this is Jim calmed was killed by a

2046
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:38,000
karate chop to the throat as
the emergency cashout there,

2047
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:38,850
Jack Ruby killing.

2048
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:41,070
That's what makes raises mind where I go,

2049
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,820
why would Jack Ruby killed

2050
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,220
and then just keep his
mouth shut and go to jail.

2051
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,810
What the fuck is that about?

2052
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,011
That?

2053
00:54:49,011 --> 00:54:53,340
That's the part that I think
is really super expert on JFK.

2054
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,350
You know more than I do,

2055
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:57,510
but I spent a lot of time on JFK as well.

2056
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,021
I just,

2057
00:54:58,021 --> 00:54:58,620
you just,

2058
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:58,831
you know,

2059
00:54:58,831 --> 00:54:59,611
I just let you talk,

2060
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:02,880
but I know a lot about
that and there's so much,

2061
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,540
there's people,

2062
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,890
these people that know way more than me,

2063
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,540
only read a few people's books.

2064
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,580
They guy that blows me
away the most about JFK.

2065
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:10,830
Who knows that he studies all the players.

2066
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:13,650
All the mob guys involved
is a guy named ride Dawson.

2067
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,920
He's fucking JFK encyclopedia.

2068
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:17,220
Dude.

2069
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,140
He knows it's so deep.

2070
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:21,000
It's like game of Thrones times 10

2071
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,130
right?

2072
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,420
It isn't just JFK,

2073
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,470
Lee Harvey Oswald,

2074
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:27,030
and maybe a couple other assassins.

2075
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,130
It's so God damn deep.

2076
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,080
Do you could spend a life,

2077
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,550
a lifetime just studying all the
names and how they're all connected.

2078
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:36,300
It's crazy.

2079
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,320
It's super vast.

2080
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:37,831
Well,

2081
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:41,070
it's unquestionably a mystery
and the idea that it's not,

2082
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:46,050
it's pretty ridiculous to me
that that trial down Nice Greece,

2083
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,210
that wouldn't happen if
she had a nice karate.

2084
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:50,551
Yeah.

2085
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:50,871
Look at this.

2086
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:53,460
She's fighting off her back here.

2087
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,770
I heard you said I was far left to say,

2088
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:56,011
you know,

2089
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:57,270
I'm so not far left.

2090
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:57,781
Oh,

2091
00:55:57,781 --> 00:55:58,540
I thought you were.

2092
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:58,930
No,

2093
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,430
no.

2094
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,510
That's where all Hillary down.

2095
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:00,901
No,

2096
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:02,400
I don't believe in big
government or anything.

2097
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,660
I believe in small government,

2098
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:05,860
Libertarian.

2099
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,001
I'm,

2100
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:07,320
I'm what I believe in.

2101
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:08,790
Like just maximum personal freedom.

2102
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,780
Small government.

2103
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,590
Yeah.

2104
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,580
Total transparency.

2105
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,150
All that stuff.

2106
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,983
Okay.

2107
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,110
Okay.

2108
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:14,250
No,

2109
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,220
I know you cause you thought because of
the Hillary thing now that was just more

2110
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,210
my anti Trump thing.

2111
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:19,350
I used to,

2112
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:19,491
I,

2113
00:56:19,491 --> 00:56:21,060
I don't like Hillary at all.

2114
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,373
Okay.

2115
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,140
The one,

2116
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,973
either one of them

2117
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,180
just say you now.

2118
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,093
All right.

2119
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,613
Um,

2120
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,841
and by the way,

2121
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:29,250
I don't care.

2122
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,100
I heard somebody said,

2123
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,680
why do people have an obsession
with Kung Fu being real?

2124
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,340
What are they still make these movies?

2125
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,860
All people do stupid.

2126
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,690
Like we know now what works.

2127
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,320
And it seems like for a long time though,

2128
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:40,480
stupid Kung Fu movies,

2129
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,700
they died off in the UFC
became really popular.

2130
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:47,800
But the appeal of people who could just
like magically make people fly from like

2131
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:49,750
a touch to the chest and shit like that.

2132
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,420
It's so romantic to us
that we bring it back.

2133
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,250
It was,

2134
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,930
it was kind of before we
could prove that staff member,

2135
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:56,943
like what my,

2136
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,120
I remember it,

2137
00:56:58,121 --> 00:56:58,511
first of all,

2138
00:56:58,511 --> 00:56:59,291
it was Asian,

2139
00:56:59,291 --> 00:56:59,561
right?

2140
00:56:59,561 --> 00:56:59,991
So it was just,

2141
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:02,170
there was a mystery to being from China.

2142
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,350
There was a mystery from being from
Japan where it was it we didn't,

2143
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,080
the languages are so different from,

2144
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:07,914
from English.

2145
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,800
So for us,

2146
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,350
this idea that they had these secrets,

2147
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:11,890
these,

2148
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,491
these debt,

2149
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:17,140
like touching things and pass your points
and he was so wise and he was so quiet

2150
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:17,980
and so humble.

2151
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,870
We wanted that person to be,

2152
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:20,381
to know.

2153
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:22,360
So we all as human beings want mystery.

2154
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,021
We had this,

2155
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:23,681
what all this stuff.

2156
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:24,514
It's about we all,

2157
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,400
we all want to be part of a secret group.

2158
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:28,090
We all want,

2159
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,590
we want to be in the know all of us.

2160
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,590
So when somebody is a master
of Kung Fu and breaks,

2161
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:34,600
boards can imagine if there's a

2162
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,523
is

2163
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,120
touch,

2164
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,080
it will be hilarious.

2165
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,470
Bruce movies were incredible.

2166
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:46,360
Think about enter the dragon that changed
people's entire lives as in they went,

2167
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,610
I'm only going to learn karate
and I'm going in that direction.

2168
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,301
I'm gonna open a school.

2169
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:51,840
My whole life is going to be that and
you got to walk around with our control

2170
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,660
was just head kicked.

2171
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,290
Her ventricle.

2172
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:54,570
Hey is on queer street right now.

2173
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,733
She has hurt.

2174
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,633
Oh,

2175
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,990
oh she ate.

2176
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,740
Oh Shit.

2177
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,390
That head kick

2178
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,090
and run.

2179
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:07,480
How she has it to slip to oh boy.

2180
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,590
She go wobbled.

2181
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,620
Damn powerful shoot for that single.

2182
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,230
Can guys wear skirts to,

2183
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,370
yes,

2184
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,350
I would look at the slides.

2185
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,480
Capillaries to do the spartan style.

2186
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:19,620
Oh,

2187
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,950
you'd probably should start doing comes
Donald flow loose kicking Melvin Manhoef

2188
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:25,450
member when he used to
wear this gladiator ones.

2189
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,850
Those are the bad God shit.

2190
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,880
He does everything hard man.

2191
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,030
No was so scary.

2192
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,960
There's videos of men who have hidden
the pads and make you want to never hit

2193
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:34,893
pads again.

2194
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,180
Well how about this?

2195
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:42,630
There's a hey of him playing like
just Piñata with Robbie Lawler's legs.

2196
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,930
That's the craziest thing.

2197
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:44,471
When he was kicking.

2198
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:47,020
Robbie Lawler is one that fine.

2199
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:47,973
You know,

2200
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,610
hit him back with one belt one?

2201
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:52,661
I believe so.

2202
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:53,320
I think so.

2203
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,610
I think she's still doing the day.

2204
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,020
I think he's kickboxing too.

2205
00:58:56,021 --> 00:58:56,711
I think he varies.

2206
00:58:56,711 --> 00:58:57,640
He goes back and forth.

2207
00:58:57,641 --> 00:58:59,200
So explosive it tour,

2208
00:58:59,201 --> 00:58:59,471
you know,

2209
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:01,390
how's it the big kickboxing
organization too.

2210
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:05,050
So you know a Gaston Bolanos
is going back and forth.

2211
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:08,710
He did his MMA be BW with Dell belter
and then he's going to do a kickboxing

2212
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,850
fight with Bella tour in April

2213
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,300
mount.

2214
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,030
Uh,

2215
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,500
would you say that um,

2216
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,070
kickboxing get has more
head trauma than boxing?

2217
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:18,850
Yoga?

2218
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,211
It does.

2219
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:19,420
Huh?

2220
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:19,811
Yeah,

2221
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:20,650
I would think so.

2222
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,060
I mean the,

2223
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,770
the thing is if the kicks land the thing,

2224
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,070
it's,

2225
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,320
if there are only three rounds though,

2226
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:27,154
right?

2227
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,040
Well it depends.

2228
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,260
Some of them are five championship rounds.

2229
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:30,950
Um,

2230
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,590
but the thing about like,

2231
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,400
it depends if you're
more Thai or kickboxing,

2232
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,310
Muay Thai,

2233
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:42,680
you're definitely getting hit in the
head a lot with elbows caught though Joe

2234
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,020
maybe I think it's not as
goal straight get back.

2235
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,160
Oh,

2236
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,133
but it's true.

2237
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,960
Begs off bitch Korez is
fighting with everything.

2238
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:52,850
She's got to see numbers.

2239
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,830
I would like to see like
actual impact numbers.

2240
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:57,550
Oh she's not sure if that was not good.

2241
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:58,611
The thing is,

2242
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:03,560
the potential for getting neck
kicked or head kicks ref is,

2243
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,380
but then it's kind of overfishing go on.

2244
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:07,230
Taking punishments.

2245
01:00:07,231 --> 01:00:07,730
True.

2246
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,540
That's a good point.

2247
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,090
Presenting the question is like what
kind of head trauma we talking about?

2248
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:13,310
We talking about one big bomb.

2249
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,091
What's worse?

2250
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:16,820
One big bomb or eating like 50,

2251
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,080
triple g jabs.

2252
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,460
50 triple g jabs.

2253
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,280
What people die from usually
like this rough a lot.

2254
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:27,080
You think that's better
than Nicole Gonzaga Cro cop.

2255
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,010
Oh hundred percent dude.

2256
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:31,820
That's cray is very tough.

2257
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,840
You got to respect her,

2258
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:33,290
her,

2259
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,123
her heart here.

2260
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:35,983
You got to,

2261
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,920
do you remember when nobody thought that
you'd ever see women fight like this?

2262
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:44,090
I know like women fights were
never really big and boxing.

2263
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,290
I mean they kind of,

2264
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,450
they're still not the gold medal winner.

2265
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:48,380
She's awesome knowledge.

2266
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,990
But you had a few that
were like interesting.

2267
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:54,130
Like Christy Martin and then there was um,

2268
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,041
lay low,

2269
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:56,180
see a Riker.

2270
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,780
Lucier Ryko was probably one
of the best female boxers.

2271
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,340
Probably the best one ever.

2272
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,720
And then Laila Ali,

2273
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,280
because she was Muhammad Ali's daughter,

2274
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:08,060
she got a lot of press Riker can hit
like she was and then there's that other

2275
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,670
girl to mia St John.

2276
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:10,240
Remember her?

2277
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,240
What about Christy?

2278
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:12,080
What was your see Martin,

2279
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,270
the coal miner's daughter back attack.

2280
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:14,900
Powerful.

2281
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,340
There's just not enough depth.

2282
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:16,860
So the,

2283
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,120
it never grows like
one girl who dominates,

2284
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:21,240
but then they just go a,

2285
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:21,711
of course.

2286
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:25,430
How did I forget Anne Wolf and wolf was
probably the scariest knockout artists

2287
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,200
waiting for women's boxing.

2288
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:27,441
Oh,

2289
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:28,370
she's phenomenal.

2290
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,400
And that it's over and
she's a sick coach too.

2291
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,660
Amazing coach.

2292
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,100
But you know what man,

2293
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:34,431
it's just,

2294
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:35,031
it never,

2295
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:37,550
we never saw this many matchups like,

2296
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:39,040
and you never saw this many match.

2297
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:39,351
I was like,

2298
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:43,070
the thing about boxing is you're only
really going to see like maybe two fights,

2299
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,120
maybe three.

2300
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:45,890
If you're really going to
watch a pay per view card.

2301
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,020
Do you watch you sit
through the whole card?

2302
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:48,873
Do you,

2303
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,920
cause if I watch a UFC and there's
five fights in the main event,

2304
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,091
like in the main car,

2305
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:56,090
you're going to probably watch
every fight and be pumped about it.

2306
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,020
That's why UFC does well in the short
amount of time has grown so much because

2307
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:01,590
the five entertaining fight Jack,

2308
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:05,930
do you know the people and the kid with
Boxton like on the undercard of a Floyd

2309
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,750
Mayweather fights usually
shit like why is it like that?

2310
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:09,681
Why not stack?

2311
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:11,360
It was some good times man.

2312
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:12,350
Well the UFC,

2313
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,310
they saw the holes in boxing's promotion
came and they capitalized on it.

2314
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,031
This is the other thing.

2315
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:19,650
Why I think women bigger than boxing,

2316
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,030
this

2317
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,300
shit bitch go,

2318
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:23,250
hey is bridging on a changing on her chin.

2319
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,290
But how much pressure
are you allowed to apply?

2320
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:26,850
Cause you can't strike with your head,

2321
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,813
right?

2322
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,640
You can't put all the pressure you want,

2323
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:30,330
but can you batch,

2324
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,950
you can backwards headbutted he can,

2325
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:33,180
you know you can't have but,

2326
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,051
but you could put any,

2327
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:36,030
what do you do here when
they had that weird though,

2328
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:36,870
come on man,

2329
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,340
you could head kick somebody's butt.

2330
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:41,760
You can't backwards head
buttom why can't you backwards?

2331
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,940
Headbutt him backwards head.

2332
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,500
But I feel like you should be able to do,

2333
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,373
you can't hit button.

2334
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:47,420
And you know what?

2335
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,770
Let me start that league
and that the tennis court.

2336
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:50,800
Well make that happen.

2337
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:52,880
Don't you feel like that?

2338
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,820
You should be able to backwards.

2339
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:54,991
How can we,

2340
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:55,300
yeah,

2341
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,790
we tennis court size.

2342
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,340
We agreed on this way.

2343
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:04,890
We know like there's something that
accentuates the bigger than a basketball

2344
01:03:04,891 --> 01:03:05,490
court.

2345
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,060
Um,

2346
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,630
no,

2347
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,080
no,

2348
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,410
no,

2349
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:07,740
no.

2350
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,650
Basketball courts picker.

2351
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,790
Oh by the tennis court is
I believe a hundred feet.

2352
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,180
Right?

2353
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:15,630
How long?

2354
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:16,201
How long is it,

2355
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:17,190
what's bigger Jamie?

2356
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,840
I think basketball is longer.

2357
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:19,680
Tennis is wider.

2358
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:20,280
Jamie.

2359
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,420
People ask you questions in real life
and ask you to pull that shit out.

2360
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:23,631
Doing this.

2361
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:24,464
My life

2362
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,410
courts are 78 feet
basketball courts in 94.

2363
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:28,951
Okay,

2364
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:29,910
so it was a little rain.

2365
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:31,830
Get to the basketball game.

2366
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:35,551
But here's the thing.

2367
01:03:35,551 --> 01:03:37,020
Do you think that you should be able,

2368
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:37,430
if you,

2369
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:39,630
if you're able to elbow
someone in the face,

2370
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,330
why can't you backwards head and someone
going to die because you backwards head

2371
01:03:43,331 --> 01:03:45,270
butted somebody that knows.

2372
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,133
Yeah,

2373
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,223
add it.

2374
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,091
The technique,

2375
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,110
I feel like that's a real tank.

2376
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:49,601
Tech head.

2377
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:53,640
Bunch of BS percent headbutt hundred
percent 100 the back of the head.

2378
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,880
You know what I feel like if you don't ask

2379
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,000
someone for a neck kick.

2380
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:00,511
Okay.

2381
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,970
If your neck kicking someone and
you're getting them back here.

2382
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:06,030
If a guy standing like this and you're
coming over the top of the right kick,

2383
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,040
you weren't hitting him in
the back of the fucking head.

2384
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:08,903
What do you think Brandon?

2385
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,010
I'm cool with tech back here.

2386
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,431
I'm cool with headbutts.

2387
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:15,330
I'm not cool with,

2388
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:18,030
if you have someone's back elbow in the
back of the head just cause there's a

2389
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:18,873
law,

2390
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,740
there's not a ton of
all fucking dangerous.

2391
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:25,440
It's all at the back of the
head can make you can go blind.

2392
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,240
Very,

2393
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,073
very vulnerable

2394
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,290
because it's permanent
damage to the eyeballs,

2395
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,793
not my brain bro.

2396
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,840
You're hitting the ball
arenas on Indian reservations.

2397
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:40,930
That's what we find out.

2398
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,360
Those who were not to take this
to Indians and the has got a lot.

2399
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,060
I think I'm going to,

2400
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:49,000
I'm not giving this to,

2401
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,750
we watch this fight.

2402
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,460
We barely watched this fight,

2403
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,360
but the sin,

2404
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,300
you gotta remember they're
in the majority draw.

2405
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,163
Whoa.

2406
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,303
Oh Wow.

2407
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:02,640
Well Marion is more excited.

2408
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:03,930
She's happy and bitch go.

2409
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:05,730
Hey has not little booty chap there.

2410
01:05:05,731 --> 01:05:06,564
See that?

2411
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:07,411
Oh,

2412
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:08,590
there it goes to the dance.

2413
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,320
What is the mobile phase?

2414
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,373
She got beat up,

2415
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,700
but my is tough.

2416
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,440
She's thick withdrawals.

2417
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,281
Yeah.

2418
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,060
Yes sir.

2419
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,893
Boom Sir.

2420
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,040
Um,

2421
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,341
yeah,

2422
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:21,971
so if we did it,

2423
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:23,470
we'd have to do it on
an Indian reservation.

2424
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:24,363
Yeah.

2425
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,830
What does the other one,

2426
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:26,981
the one right there.

2427
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:27,570
Um,

2428
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,930
[inaudible] son.

2429
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:29,290
Yeah.

2430
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,123
Mohegan Sun.

2431
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:30,341
Yeah.

2432
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:32,730
We're going to have to go with a ton
of stuff we can some bell toward.

2433
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,390
Does a bunch of fights and reservations.

2434
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:39,380
You don't have to test a basketball
arena though on an Indian reservation.

2435
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:39,730
That's,

2436
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,660
let's not get greedy.

2437
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:41,813
We can't.

2438
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,331
The whole point is,

2439
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:44,270
it's gotta be on a bath.

2440
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,921
You build it.

2441
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:45,521
They will come.

2442
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:46,750
Let's just build one ourselves.

2443
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,580
Caught the fight companion arena.

2444
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:48,731
Well,

2445
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:53,590
if you just have it in a basketball
sized flat area at the bottom of their

2446
01:05:53,591 --> 01:05:54,340
arena,

2447
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,300
they must have an arena.

2448
01:05:55,301 --> 01:05:56,270
If they're having these events.

2449
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,520
Now you're talking about WCL,

2450
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:58,550
the Chuck Norris Shifts.

2451
01:05:58,990 --> 01:05:59,823
You had one in there.

2452
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:04,150
You just have that center area where you
have that octagon spread it out by at

2453
01:06:04,151 --> 01:06:06,370
least another seven feet on each side.

2454
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,000
Get rid of this mat it down.

2455
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:08,200
Yeah.

2456
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:08,710
Yeah,

2457
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:09,370
Matt it down.

2458
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:12,250
That's what that place was because this
is a Olympic training center where the

2459
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:14,770
had a lot of the Olympic stuff
like wrestling and stuff like that,

2460
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,611
so he could do that.

2461
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:17,320
They're the only really issue.

2462
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:20,850
The only real issue would be
people storming the s the f,

2463
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:22,840
the flat area where the
people are competing.

2464
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,991
Well,

2465
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:25,330
you got to act like a
Goddamn like they do and I do

2466
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,340
wonder what you would be able
to do to stop that though,

2467
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,930
because the thing is if somebody
wanted to charge octagon,

2468
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:33,671
it's very,

2469
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:34,840
there's a lot of steps.

2470
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,130
Good like charging that,

2471
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,993
huh?

2472
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:38,023
Yeah.

2473
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:38,351
I mean,

2474
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:39,131
security might work,

2475
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:42,870
but if there's actually
like a mob basketball games,

2476
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,070
if they just wanted a
file out onto the court,

2477
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:45,410
it could be,

2478
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:46,061
it never happened.

2479
01:06:46,061 --> 01:06:47,290
The basketball happened once.

2480
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:48,220
These are fighters,

2481
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,270
they're savages.

2482
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,000
No,

2483
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,520
the crowd's not going to be savages.

2484
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:54,460
Some nightclub in the audience
and someone in the audit.

2485
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,250
Do you remember when Anson
anyway fought frank shamrock

2486
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,180
and frank shamrock was,

2487
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:02,140
is he fight hen center?

2488
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:02,974
Egan.

2489
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,770
Who did you fight and Tencent and he was,

2490
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,161
that's right.

2491
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:10,000
And he's beating him and they stopped
the fight and YG and jumped into the ring

2492
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:14,680
and started attacking Frank Shamrock
when Frank Frank stopped answering with a

2493
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:19,681
bunch of needs to face and then Egan
jumped frank like now if that was a flat

2494
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:20,920
area.

2495
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,120
Yeah,

2496
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,910
and not,

2497
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:22,950
not like a,

2498
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:23,890
it could be a me laying,

2499
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,970
it can be chaos.

2500
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:25,121
Oh,

2501
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:28,940
he talking about royal rumble and then
you got to charge more with basketball.

2502
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:30,280
A lot of times at the end,

2503
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:32,550
people run on the court calls.

2504
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,573
Never Mba.

2505
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,210
Mba,

2506
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:36,000
you can't get on the court security.

2507
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,150
I don't think that's
going to be a problem.

2508
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,020
Many of them.

2509
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:38,853
I think that,

2510
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,341
you know what,

2511
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:40,750
we've got to just trash to plan ahead.

2512
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,870
We got bigger fish to fry fish.

2513
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,840
The bigger fish forgiveness thing,

2514
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,570
sanctioned buying a stadium.

2515
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:46,863
We go to,

2516
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,360
we go to somewhere that's conservation.

2517
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:51,700
You could make your own rules
at any of her as restoration,

2518
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:52,903
right?

2519
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:56,831
Maybe they changed.

2520
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:57,011
No,

2521
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:57,844
we can.

2522
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:58,901
They can.

2523
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,030
They can do whatever the
fuck they want to pay them.

2524
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:01,720
A nice royal.

2525
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,150
They have crazy rules like
here's the thing that they,

2526
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:05,950
that drives some people nuts.

2527
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:09,610
They can hunt whatever they want whenever
they want a hunted and they can do

2528
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:10,830
whatever method they want,

2529
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:14,200
like the Indians and Canada that
you spotlights to hunt Moose.

2530
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,220
They shine at night on the Moose.

2531
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,780
The Moose don't know
what the fuck's going on.

2532
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:18,171
Boom.

2533
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:19,910
They blast him from the back of Atvs.

2534
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:22,640
They do all this different shit
that you're not allowed to do.

2535
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,420
If you're a regular person,

2536
01:08:24,421 --> 01:08:24,770
you're like,

2537
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,011
dude,

2538
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:25,281
you say,

2539
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:25,910
yeah,

2540
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:26,780
but if you're a ne,

2541
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,890
I mean it doesn't matter if you're white.

2542
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:28,521
If you're a black guy,

2543
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,300
you're not allowed to do it.

2544
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,940
I'm saying if you're not
one of the first natives,

2545
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,440
it made the call the first nation.

2546
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:34,563
First nation.

2547
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,420
Yeah.

2548
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:35,740
Yeah.

2549
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,010
I was total sorta,

2550
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:37,801
whoa bro.

2551
01:08:37,801 --> 01:08:40,340
He's a thing like how
far are we going back?

2552
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:44,030
Because it wasn't their land when
it was covering two miles of ice.

2553
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:44,421
Okay.

2554
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:46,170
That was just 10,000 years old once land.

2555
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:46,941
But exactly.

2556
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:49,580
So who's to say that like human land?

2557
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:49,941
Well,

2558
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:52,220
who knows how it was set out?

2559
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,570
Who knows who conquered who to establish
their domain in that like to share

2560
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:57,080
before,

2561
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,490
before anybody who is,

2562
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,473
you know,

2563
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:01,520
try not before the native Americans,

2564
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:01,921
but no,

2565
01:09:01,921 --> 01:09:02,990
not for the native Americans.

2566
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:05,540
Native Americans were
here from fucking Siberia,

2567
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:07,880
but established too.

2568
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:08,953
They all gone,

2569
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,310
you're right.

2570
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:11,600
But they all wandered here.

2571
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:11,931
See,

2572
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:14,390
the thing is they know exactly.

2573
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,140
That's the,

2574
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:20,140
the reality is we are feeling terrible
as people that inherited this beautiful

2575
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:25,751
place called Los Angeles
from some barbarians that
at one point in time took it

2576
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,490
from some other people
that were here first.

2577
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:28,611
I mean,

2578
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:30,520
that's really what oil
bad for the dinosaur.

2579
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,960
It doesn't have anything to do with
the people that are there right now.

2580
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:33,681
That's my point.

2581
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:35,540
The people that are in those
reservations right now,

2582
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:39,260
they didn't get anything stolen from
them and they were born in 1968 you know

2583
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:39,890
what I'm saying?

2584
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:42,320
It's like the whole thing is squirrely
that you're allowing them to have

2585
01:09:42,321 --> 01:09:43,154
casinos.

2586
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,360
They gonna have cage fights,

2587
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,670
negative rooster fights with
fucking nuclear weapons attached.

2588
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:47,523
Their beaks.

2589
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:52,850
Ian's allowed to crosswalk
with just like flashing and ID.

2590
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,290
They don't get checked
or anything like that.

2591
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:54,980
I'd wonder,

2592
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:55,813
I don't know.

2593
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:56,630
Mexico,

2594
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,931
India,

2595
01:09:56,931 --> 01:10:00,290
Canada and the states and
into Mexico back and forth.

2596
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:01,181
It's,

2597
01:10:01,181 --> 01:10:02,014
it is.

2598
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:06,590
It's really odd that they're allowed
to just have casinos and just,

2599
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:10,040
and they also make partnerships
with people who aren't native,

2600
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:10,911
you know?

2601
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:13,230
And then those guys profit
off these casinos too.

2602
01:10:13,231 --> 01:10:15,080
It's like you get a stipend
from the government.

2603
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:15,900
Yeah.

2604
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,461
Shit.

2605
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:17,001
Load of money.

2606
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:17,481
I did a,

2607
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:19,340
I did an appearance at
an Indian reservation.

2608
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,660
They were bawling.

2609
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:22,040
Is the Beverly Hills of Indians.

2610
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,420
There's all that too.

2611
01:10:23,421 --> 01:10:25,580
From the fucking ankles up.

2612
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:26,630
Full body tattooed.

2613
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:29,060
Isn't it crazy too that you
still call them Indians?

2614
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,210
Like that was a mistake like
they were supposed to be.

2615
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:33,950
They thought they were in India.

2616
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,770
These dumb motherfuckers

2617
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:37,890
definitely,

2618
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:41,180
this is not India native Americans,

2619
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,910
but they're not even David and I are
native American or sue or tropical

2620
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,520
heat test parkin until Comanche Apache.

2621
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,020
But there were some Pueblo,

2622
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,160
there was some amazing,

2623
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:55,490
amazing people and they did some
incredible shit or some savages.

2624
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,300
What does this say?

2625
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,840
Once you have proven that you are
at least 50% aboriginal blood,

2626
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:00,650
uh,

2627
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,700
if you were born in Canada,

2628
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:03,470
if you have at least 50% aboriginal blood,

2629
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:05,480
you may be entitled to
certain rights and he's right.

2630
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:10,430
You can cross the US Canadian border
freely can live and work in the u s wow.

2631
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,410
Be Eligible for public
benefits such as Medicaid,

2632
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,130
supplemental

2633
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,120
security income,

2634
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,180
medicare or unemployment benefits
and other public assistance.

2635
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:19,020
Proven,

2636
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,840
provided you meet the
appropriate agency guidelines.

2637
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:25,830
You could register for
college or university in the
United States as a domestic

2638
01:11:25,831 --> 01:11:27,390
student rather than a foreign student.

2639
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,553
Wow.

2640
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:29,523
Interesting.

2641
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,051
Yeah,

2642
01:11:31,051 --> 01:11:31,830
man,

2643
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,900
you do not have to
register for the military.

2644
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:35,790
You do not have to obtain a work permit.

2645
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,730
You do not have to be processed
for an alien registration card.

2646
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:39,840
Also known as green card.

2647
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,450
The U s government cannot deport you.

2648
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:46,350
They cannot exclude you from entry and
they cannot deny you services and they

2649
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,340
run shit doe.

2650
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,560
Does anyone have any Indian Indian in him?

2651
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:54,561
You have to have 50% a Mohawk
t mobile arena reserves.

2652
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,120
June 10 for Mayweather.

2653
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:56,963
Mcgregor,

2654
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:57,910
good.

2655
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:00,210
Zoobilee it's fucking happening.

2656
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,620
How is that going to happen?

2657
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,483
What do you mean?

2658
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,450
How do you think the UFC and
were there come to an agreement?

2659
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,080
Yes.

2660
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,560
That's what's happening in Conoco's

2661
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:11,670
is in cahoots with the UFC.

2662
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:12,210
Let's get,

2663
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:13,710
I guarantee you you'll see is involved,

2664
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:14,371
but the report,

2665
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:17,580
who knows who made that report pretty
legit hit it on the way over here.

2666
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,103
I made a,

2667
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:20,580
I might have.

2668
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,110
I think it's going to happen man.

2669
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:22,711
Wow.

2670
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:23,461
You really think so.

2671
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:27,220
I really do and you're asking me to come
to in it so let's just figure this out

2672
01:12:27,221 --> 01:12:29,360
and how you want to talk to you do

2673
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:31,740
probably companion.

2674
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,450
I don't know man.

2675
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,530
I don't know what I'm doing.

2676
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:35,251
Well,

2677
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:36,210
if you're not commentating,

2678
01:12:36,211 --> 01:12:38,310
we need to do like giant companion for it.

2679
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:40,740
And that was celebrate the shit out of it.

2680
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:42,000
I would prefer that.

2681
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:42,690
Honestly,

2682
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:47,310
June 10th June 10th it's about to get a
lot of my man Mayweather throws you that

2683
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,390
TMT money.

2684
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,590
Hmm.

2685
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,410
I don't think they really
care about me commentating.

2686
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,490
They'd probably want Max
Kellerman or of the boxing people.

2687
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,820
Max Kellerman you it would be fun.

2688
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,840
I would love to do it with them,

2689
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,980
but that's what I,

2690
01:12:58,981 --> 01:12:59,281
that's,

2691
01:12:59,281 --> 01:13:00,750
that's boxing match.

2692
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,231
You know,

2693
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:02,710
that's their world has been,

2694
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,950
if it was an MMA match though,

2695
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,510
and he was sitting down
next to me doing commentary,

2696
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,310
you know that,

2697
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:09,060
I think that would be a little odd to not,

2698
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,670
not a Floyd was just
doing boxing the octagon.

2699
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:12,620
You know what I'm saying?

2700
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,770
You need can be an awesome,

2701
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:14,551
well no,

2702
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:14,711
no,

2703
01:13:14,711 --> 01:13:14,750
no.

2704
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,160
I'm saying if the roles were reversed,

2705
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,450
I think you could talk about
moving Connor's history cause they,

2706
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,420
they're not giving a shit.

2707
01:13:21,421 --> 01:13:22,230
Let's be real.

2708
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:22,861
They're going to be like,

2709
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,810
you know Shannon Sharpe talking about UFC.

2710
01:13:24,811 --> 01:13:25,980
It's tough to listen to.

2711
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,110
It's going to be good at
someone who's knowledgeable.

2712
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:30,060
Breakdown like commerce history,

2713
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,013
how he came here.

2714
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,070
He got his movement.

2715
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:33,090
What he's known for.

2716
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,250
I think that's super important.

2717
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:37,370
You have to have people
who don't watch UFC.

2718
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,550
Yeah cause you're getting
a shit load of new boxing.

2719
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:40,271
You know it sounds bad.

2720
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:40,980
It's tune in,

2721
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:41,910
hanging out with you guys.

2722
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:42,541
Smoking weed,

2723
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:43,351
watching it right here.

2724
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:44,610
That's how it's so much better.

2725
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,890
I just want my dear friend Joe Rogan,

2726
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:48,570
part of the biggest fight
of combat and history.

2727
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,413
I'm good.

2728
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,480
I'd like to see a big deal right here.

2729
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,860
Cause you don't think that's
the biggest fight in his life.

2730
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:58,790
The biggest fight in history bigger
than Ali Frazier number wise.

2731
01:13:58,791 --> 01:13:59,040
Yeah.

2732
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,360
Yeah.

2733
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,640
It's a big paper view ever
because it brings in two worlds.

2734
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,150
It brings in the UFC world and this one
guy who was unquestionably the biggest

2735
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:06,870
star in the UFC,

2736
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:09,600
unquestionably by a long shot,

2737
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,100
and then you bring in a guy has been

2738
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,740
one of the biggest money makers
in the history of boxing game,

2739
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:17,680
the only guy to go 49 and
no others in rocky Marciano.

2740
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:18,431
I mean,

2741
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:22,180
he's like right there and we'd love to
break rocky Marciano's record and then

2742
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:22,961
you know what man,

2743
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:26,740
when people want to do things like break
someone's record and you want to do it

2744
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:30,640
so bad that you take on a guy who's
never had a boxing match before and then

2745
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:31,840
that guy starches you,

2746
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:33,773
me.

2747
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:34,991
I mean,

2748
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:36,040
it's not like that.

2749
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,720
I'm going to build a shrine to him,

2750
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:38,640
pray to whatever it is.

2751
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:39,540
Some of them,

2752
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,481
man,

2753
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:41,141
I'm telling you,

2754
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:42,370
there's something about that dude.

2755
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:43,720
He's got something going on.

2756
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:44,231
Magic.

2757
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:46,120
He's got a little something extra special,

2758
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:46,954
but he would need,

2759
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:48,940
he would need everything to line up.

2760
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,480
It would have to be the
McGregor Mayweather.

2761
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:55,150
It would have to dismiss him as a threat.

2762
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,010
He'd have to not train hard enough,

2763
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:00,520
hit up to not seriously
consider the possibility that
Connor connects on him and

2764
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:01,354
knocks him out.

2765
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,140
Right.

2766
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:05,170
And then kind of would have
to do some rough housing.

2767
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:07,150
He would have to hold it and get clench.

2768
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,210
He'd have to hold them and hit 'em.

2769
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:12,970
You'd have to try to get off as many
shots and bullying around and wear him out

2770
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,230
to a possibility.

2771
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,190
It's a possibility.

2772
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:16,720
He's a much bigger mass.

2773
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,720
He's a much bigger man.

2774
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,690
Yeah,

2775
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,021
very,

2776
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:20,561
very quick.

2777
01:15:20,561 --> 01:15:22,480
But if you compare the
two of them frame wise,

2778
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:26,440
like what if they ever do
do it and they're standing
right at each other looking

2779
01:15:26,441 --> 01:15:27,274
down at each other,

2780
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,461
you know,

2781
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:28,211
do an eye to eye.

2782
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:28,720
You're going to go,

2783
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,560
oh shit.

2784
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,860
Yeah.

2785
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,760
Connor's way.

2786
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:33,730
Because you remember when Eddie Alvarez
was going Idi with Connor and you

2787
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:35,140
realize how big Connor's head is.

2788
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:36,223
He like Jesus,

2789
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,530
just a bigger dude cause I'm shoulders,

2790
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:39,430
his legs.

2791
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:40,810
He's a big fuck.

2792
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,230
I mean he could make that 145 pound
cut when he's on death's door,

2793
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,060
but may whether it makes it easy,

2794
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:48,580
what are they going to fight
at 45 that's a good question.

2795
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,210
No,

2796
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:51,780
maybe there was fighting at
one 54 his last two fights.

2797
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,790
I bet they do it like 55 or 60 maybe.

2798
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:57,560
Maybe it depends on what
may was comfortable with it,

2799
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,630
but I think the,

2800
01:15:58,910 --> 01:15:59,710
in Dana Light,

2801
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:01,300
you want to be part of that fight.

2802
01:16:01,301 --> 01:16:04,090
If you're Dana let you want to be
in cahoots with all these guys with

2803
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,230
Mayweather,

2804
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:05,770
Floyd,

2805
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:09,460
or don't want the fight to
take place at all and book.

2806
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:10,091
He's got the,

2807
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:11,920
he got fucked because number Grumet off,

2808
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:12,754
got sick,

2809
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:13,690
making that weight.

2810
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,280
If number get Madoff didn't get sick,

2811
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:16,114
making that weight.

2812
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,610
Then neuroma Madoff and Tony Ferguson,

2813
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,780
Dana White did.

2814
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,550
Oh No,

2815
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:23,170
the UFC did because look,

2816
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,190
the real fight is the winner of her.

2817
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,190
Tony Ferguson and Habib number,

2818
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:29,170
good metal in the UFC.

2819
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:29,451
Right.

2820
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:32,650
So that's the real fight is like being
a big challenge for Conor and that could

2821
01:16:32,651 --> 01:16:33,720
be a million plus papers.

2822
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,560
The purest.

2823
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,393
Right.

2824
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,820
Especially if you,

2825
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:41,110
if you either have that fight or the
better fight financially is another fight

2826
01:16:41,111 --> 01:16:41,860
with Nate Diaz.

2827
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:42,071
No,

2828
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:44,280
the better fight financial
is may with Oh yeah,

2829
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,720
for box for sure.

2830
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:46,900
The same for common or no,

2831
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,351
for sure.

2832
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:47,681
For sure.

2833
01:16:47,681 --> 01:16:52,681
Connor has a business that's by far the
HUD 100% agree with what I was saying in

2834
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:55,260
20 million weigh more
than a hundred million.

2835
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,320
A hundred by a hundred.

2836
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,540
100 million each to Ray Borg.

2837
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:59,780
Looks good as far he does.

2838
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,790
He's so fast.

2839
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,310
Um,

2840
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:04,780
w w well they a Khabib and Tony
are going to fight again though,

2841
01:17:04,781 --> 01:17:05,051
right?

2842
01:17:05,051 --> 01:17:05,884
Aren't they?

2843
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:10,100
But here's the thing that makes a
bead might be able to make that weight

2844
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:11,360
and,

2845
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,680
and you know,

2846
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:16,310
since Kelvin miss wait a couple of
times and Dana forced him to fight it,

2847
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:17,203
one 85,

2848
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:17,721
I mean,

2849
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:18,890
it makes sense to Dana goes,

2850
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:19,071
dude,

2851
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:21,140
you got to do one 70
at least once or twice,

2852
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,770
but we'll go up in weight to fight him.

2853
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:25,101
Well,

2854
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:26,240
he only mess wait once,

2855
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:27,080
twice,

2856
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:27,440
twice,

2857
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:27,801
twice,

2858
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:28,560
twice.

2859
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,360
Tonia huge.

2860
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,570
55 minutes again against anybody's tall,

2861
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:33,404
but he's not.

2862
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:38,050
He's like Tony is like
five ten five 11 okay.

2863
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:40,220
Tony's built perfect for the division.

2864
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:40,450
Yes.

2865
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:42,260
Tom Freed up 50 he's got,

2866
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:43,460
he's got a lot of muscle.

2867
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:44,510
Even though he's long.

2868
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:45,770
He's very strong.

2869
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:46,910
He's excellent in the clinch.

2870
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,530
I was looking forward
to that fight so much.

2871
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:50,413
My heart,

2872
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,250
my how big it could be.

2873
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,550
It could be got a huge frame.

2874
01:17:53,551 --> 01:17:54,260
It's a tank.

2875
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:54,471
No,

2876
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:55,790
he doesn't have a nutritionist.

2877
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:56,450
He doesn't talk.

2878
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:56,841
He's not,

2879
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:57,970
you're not being professionals.

2880
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:58,951
He's thick.

2881
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:02,450
Could you hear what Tony Tony to get done
and wondering when they're like doing

2882
01:18:02,451 --> 01:18:03,220
media?

2883
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:03,680
Yeah.

2884
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,480
And it could be with
saying something like,

2885
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,980
why do you get your sunglasses on?

2886
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,750
It's like 26 seven lunches and he's like,

2887
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:09,740
good luck or that weight cut.

2888
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,131
Yeah,

2889
01:18:10,131 --> 01:18:12,520
I hear him breathing
cause your cardio sucks.

2890
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,410
I said,

2891
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:14,570
cause your cardio sons,

2892
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,220
that's a Tony said to him,

2893
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,290
do they have to make it at 55 because
what do you do with that fucking bet?

2894
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,710
That interim title

2895
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,920
fight Floyd.

2896
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:25,610
What?

2897
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,500
We can't just fucking hang up at defy.

2898
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,950
But don't you think that that's the fight
that has to be made in that division,

2899
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:31,171
right?

2900
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:32,004
That's the right tone.

2901
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:32,391
If it's,

2902
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:35,030
but if he can't make one 55 can,

2903
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,820
he needs to get real
and get a fucking die?

2904
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:39,260
I don't know what happened to him.

2905
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,150
We don't eat Tiramisu the week of.

2906
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:45,720
I know that he did that corn on embedded
and Tony even tweet out like for sure

2907
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,360
when fucking eat Tiramisu,

2908
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,710
he really ate Tiramisu.

2909
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,120
It was on an embedded video.

2910
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:51,913
Whoa.

2911
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:52,910
That's how he smelled it.

2912
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:53,541
He was like,

2913
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:54,530
have fun making weight.

2914
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,230
Why are you helping him?

2915
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,083
Puffin,

2916
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,460
did you have to make that fight and to be,

2917
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:00,051
you can do it.

2918
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:00,380
He's just,

2919
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,580
he's made it before,

2920
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:05,150
but we don't know what happened when
he had to go to the fucking hospital.

2921
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:06,800
They said he was in massive pain.

2922
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,130
Like we also know he'd be like,

2923
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,001
hold on a second day.

2924
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:10,250
Luke Rockhold you're right.

2925
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,020
But Luke Rockhold said something.

2926
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:13,940
There was some quote that I had read.

2927
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,081
God Damn it.

2928
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:15,531
What did it see?

2929
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:15,770
What,

2930
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,420
what they said about what,

2931
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:17,820
what did,

2932
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,653
uh,

2933
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:19,020
uh,

2934
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:23,840
bebes corner list as the official
issue that was happening to him.

2935
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:25,430
He was six pounds overweight,

2936
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:26,264
right?

2937
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,170
Yes.

2938
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:28,370
When he went to the hospitals.

2939
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:28,950
And that's,

2940
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:29,900
that's huge.

2941
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,100
That's so heavy.

2942
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:34,580
You're so heavy when your
body's your body shutting down,

2943
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,430
like you're six pounds away
and your body is shutting down.

2944
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,140
Come in the week of the fight.

2945
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:39,711
Yeah.

2946
01:19:39,711 --> 01:19:41,510
But obviously fucked up with his,

2947
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:41,840
uh,

2948
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,180
his discipline if he's eaten Tiramisu.

2949
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,051
If that's true,

2950
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:46,190
that's even more disappointing.

2951
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,240
Maybe you just had a bite,

2952
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,210
but either way you don't have a,

2953
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,220
and I'm not saying it's the answer.

2954
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,900
You don't have a mic dolce or one of
these guys who are helping you with your

2955
01:19:53,901 --> 01:19:54,171
diet.

2956
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:55,004
Right.

2957
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,430
Tony's up and wait to find them.

2958
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,820
It makes sense.

2959
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,140
Can make sense for Tony.

2960
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,570
It makes sense for Tony mean
who wants to fight this guy?

2961
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:03,740
But for the division,

2962
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:04,371
it's so weird.

2963
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:04,581
It's like,

2964
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:04,731
well,

2965
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:05,031
what is,

2966
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:05,990
it sucks the division.

2967
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:06,853
What is this guys?

2968
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:07,930
The whole

2969
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,410
fights bigger than what
the division looks like.

2970
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:10,920
That fight,

2971
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,970
that fight needs to happen.

2972
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,833
I agree too.

2973
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,291
I agree.

2974
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:14,124
I agree with that.

2975
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,470
That has all this other shit's going on.

2976
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:17,460
Mayweather and Garner,

2977
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:18,230
all this other shit.

2978
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:18,900
It's the GSP.

2979
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:19,920
Bisping windows.

2980
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:20,790
Here it goes.

2981
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,391
Medical,

2982
01:20:21,391 --> 01:20:22,670
he says a weight loss,

2983
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:23,851
weight management,

2984
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:24,421
medical issues.

2985
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:25,980
He was treated and it's been discharged.

2986
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,050
That doesn't say what the issue is.

2987
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,550
This the official us.

2988
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,030
See,

2989
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:31,080
see if you could find out.

2990
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:34,980
I feel like I read an article that
was interviewing Luke Rockhold.

2991
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:39,810
Rockhold was talking about what happened
to the [inaudible] Dot Gov you see Dana

2992
01:20:39,811 --> 01:20:39,991
though?

2993
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:40,351
He goes,

2994
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:40,681
if you,

2995
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:41,370
if you were to,

2996
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,900
we maybe could assist drinking.

2997
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:43,860
Who gave him a beer?

2998
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:44,723
This isn't beer.

2999
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,713
What is it

3000
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,190
that bear fruit?

3001
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,970
So someone gave the
Gremlin water after men.

3002
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:54,650
No,

3003
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,580
but Dana was saying he panics.

3004
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,750
He goes,

3005
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,753
oh

3006
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,540
well I got a coffee cherry.

3007
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:09,780
You can't leave a guy drinking by himself.

3008
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,420
That was the moment the
wheels fell off the podcast.

3009
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:12,721
Okay,

3010
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:13,171
here it is.

3011
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,004
This is what I read.

3012
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,680
Habib wasn't getting
any blood to his liver.

3013
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,450
This is what Luke Rockhold says.

3014
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:19,290
Look,

3015
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,870
that is fucking real bad.

3016
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,550
So scroll down and let's,

3017
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:24,384
let's see what Luke,

3018
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:27,900
it says the weight cut
wasn't going very well.

3019
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,311
Could be,

3020
01:21:28,311 --> 01:21:32,040
was complaining about a pain in his side
and we had to cut short the weight cut

3021
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:34,680
and sure enough it gets worse over
night and had to go to the hospital.

3022
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,860
Unfortunately this is the fight is
really fucking four Bababa from what I

3023
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:38,311
understand,

3024
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,860
he wasn't getting any blood to his
liver and something went wrong with his

3025
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:41,460
weight cut.

3026
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,110
It's very similar to his last fight.

3027
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:45,360
What I understand and
just something went wrong.

3028
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:46,680
You never know what these weight cuts,

3029
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:47,101
I guess,

3030
01:21:47,101 --> 01:21:49,560
but I think he's ready to
go and we can rebook this.

3031
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,510
What is,

3032
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:52,670
he was wrong.

3033
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:54,120
No,

3034
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,230
he's a training partner.

3035
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,290
He's a Aka a hundred pounds
heavier training partner.

3036
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:00,890
Yeah.

3037
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,400
Well from the same gym.

3038
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:02,850
Yes.

3039
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,480
I mean it obviously
ain't a hundred pounds.

3040
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,290
He's a big walk around that.

3041
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:09,390
It could be shit.

3042
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,673
I Dunno.

3043
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:11,640
I don't want to misspeak.

3044
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,160
I'd assume high seventies yeah,

3045
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:14,911
it looks like it.

3046
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:15,360
Right?

3047
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,260
And he ain't fat.

3048
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:16,860
No,

3049
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,090
they gotta make that fight,

3050
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:18,840
man.

3051
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,673
That's the fight.

3052
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,780
I'd say that's the Madison.

3053
01:22:20,781 --> 01:22:21,870
If there'd been when
the fight fell through,

3054
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:23,730
like when John and chill thing.

3055
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:24,630
I really wasn't that math.

3056
01:22:24,631 --> 01:22:25,680
There's been other fights.

3057
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,070
Uh,

3058
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:28,350
John D C I wasn't that upset.

3059
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:28,921
This one.

3060
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:30,120
I was pissed man.

3061
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,510
I was really upset telling
me what fine his camp,

3062
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,890
everything was perfect.

3063
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,700
It was on such a good fighter.

3064
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,250
Now tell me,

3065
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:38,610
um,

3066
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:39,870
if you're allowed to speak about this,

3067
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:40,561
I don't know if you are,

3068
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:43,920
but there's been a lot of
complaints about his pay.

3069
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:44,831
Like what,

3070
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:45,121
what,

3071
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:48,720
what exactly did happen if you could
clarify what you were training him.

3072
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,060
I don't know the specifics.

3073
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:52,243
Uh,

3074
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:56,160
cause I heard he was very upset that
whatever and reading was that he was very

3075
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:58,230
upset that he wasn't
even getting show money.

3076
01:22:58,890 --> 01:22:59,850
I'm just going to say like,

3077
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:00,211
if it's,

3078
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:00,990
uh,

3079
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:01,650
if you,

3080
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:05,010
if you were getting
10,000 to show 10,000 to,

3081
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:06,280
and

3082
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,350
you made weight and your
opponent doesn't make wait,

3083
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,180
just give them the show money.

3084
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:10,900
It's 10 k,

3085
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:15,900
but when it's like big money and your
opponent can't make weight than we're not

3086
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:18,370
going to give you the whole host.

3087
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,473
All that money.

3088
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,473
Kind of like that.

3089
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,070
I feel like it should be insured
and that's why it's confusing to me.

3090
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,350
Then I totally down,

3091
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,141
I don't know exactly what,

3092
01:23:27,141 --> 01:23:28,480
and I know there was that issue.

3093
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:29,800
Will he still get that show money?

3094
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,170
I don't know if he got it or he
got half or something like that.

3095
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:32,980
I don't really like,

3096
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,460
I don't really get into it with

3097
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:36,670
Tony.

3098
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:39,610
Tony's right on that cause he
did all the necessary steps.

3099
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:40,750
You went through training camp.

3100
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,441
It's not his fault.

3101
01:23:41,441 --> 01:23:42,900
Could beep didn't fucking make,

3102
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:44,380
he suffers from it.

3103
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:45,243
You can't have that.

3104
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,070
If a fighter doesn't make
the other fighters should be,

3105
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:48,580
I'm not sure.

3106
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,240
Sure.

3107
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:49,610
Maybe.

3108
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:50,350
Maybe it was,

3109
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,790
maybe it was a deal
like this or something.

3110
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:52,360
I don't know,

3111
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,193
but maybe it was a deal.

3112
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:58,320
We can get you to 50 to show and on
whatever to win or something like that.

3113
01:23:58,781 --> 01:23:59,614
Some big,

3114
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:00,940
but we're offering that.

3115
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:01,990
If the fight happens,

3116
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,030
if for some reason your
opponent in small print at,

3117
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:06,250
doesn't that make the fight,

3118
01:24:06,251 --> 01:24:07,180
you're not going to get that show money.

3119
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,380
It's like if the fight happened,

3120
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:09,250
I feel like maybe after,

3121
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:09,590
you know,

3122
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:13,120
UFC would be smart on their
end to structure some of them.

3123
01:24:13,121 --> 01:24:13,900
They need a guarantee.

3124
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,950
Guarantee person you'd

3125
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,471
see better.

3126
01:24:15,471 --> 01:24:19,460
Five feel like you need to make a person
who does not make the weight get a

3127
01:24:19,461 --> 01:24:20,294
loss.

3128
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,790
That's what I think fucking insane.

3129
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:23,870
Feel.

3130
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:24,830
It gets a loss.

3131
01:24:24,831 --> 01:24:27,900
And I feel like there's no fight and
I feel like the other guy gets paid.

3132
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,540
There's only one way to stop it.

3133
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,280
You've got to punish people.

3134
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:32,230
Tony's going to make it.

3135
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:33,320
Yes,

3136
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:33,620
but you know,

3137
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:36,320
we gotta make it a loss because
the fighter didn't make weight.

3138
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,193
Correct.

3139
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:39,020
Why do you have four glasses there?

3140
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:39,973
One drink?

3141
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:41,960
No,

3142
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:42,021
no,

3143
01:24:42,021 --> 01:24:42,320
no.

3144
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:42,561
Here's,

3145
01:24:42,561 --> 01:24:45,170
you already had a beer gremlins.

3146
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,250
You remember the movie?

3147
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,750
He give the little cute things.

3148
01:24:47,751 --> 01:24:49,770
Water Callen determine the devils.

3149
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,670
You fucking up.

3150
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:58,320
This goes into chem trails and
operation funder foot 85 people.

3151
01:24:58,971 --> 01:25:00,020
Once he takes that,

3152
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,170
and we started talking about
Kennedy and who did it,

3153
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,513
did it,

3154
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:04,523
did it.

3155
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,433
Meanwhile,

3156
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:09,350
we're not even watching
this awesome Ray Borg fight.

3157
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:13,310
He's one of the few flyweights in this
division that like is a real interesting

3158
01:25:13,311 --> 01:25:14,840
candidate for fighting mighty mouse.

3159
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:17,750
And for me it was a
tough motherfucker man.

3160
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:21,530
People just write him off cause
he also got destroyed by Dj.

3161
01:25:21,531 --> 01:25:24,150
But number three in the world
really doesn't lose just djs.

3162
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:26,070
Just something special was just CJ.

3163
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,193
If you're listening,

3164
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,820
you got to do super fights.

3165
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,770
I'm sick of seeing you find it that way.

3166
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,310
You,

3167
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:33,860
we got to move on then Dominick Cruz,

3168
01:25:33,861 --> 01:25:34,694
do you hate money?

3169
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,500
I don't know what it is,

3170
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:37,250
man.

3171
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,090
I don't know what it is,

3172
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:38,871
but I feel like,

3173
01:25:38,871 --> 01:25:39,200
um,

3174
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,120
I want to see him clean out that division.

3175
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,580
Keep cleaning it and just keep doing it.

3176
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:43,941
Look,

3177
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:44,990
I think you,

3178
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:47,090
me and 75,000 other
people are watching this.

3179
01:25:47,091 --> 01:25:50,090
Plenty of fights for Dominick
Cruz or anybody else at one 35.

3180
01:25:50,091 --> 01:25:51,080
Between Cody Garbrandt,

3181
01:25:51,081 --> 01:25:52,100
Tj Dillashaw.

3182
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,150
Um,

3183
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:57,590
I'm lean Linacre is much less attractive
out Dillashaw exposed him dealer shop

3184
01:25:57,591 --> 01:25:59,120
pretty much kind of clowned him.

3185
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,240
God Damn Dillashaw was good
enough to me till a shawl.

3186
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,074
Gar Brant,

3187
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,750
what do you think happens in that fight?

3188
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,913
That's big.

3189
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:08,181
Tell you what,

3190
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:08,361
man,

3191
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:12,660
I would've had one opinion of what would
happen in that fight before the cruise

3192
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:13,790
fight and before,

3193
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:14,900
uh,

3194
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,430
before Cody fought Cruz,

3195
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:18,080
but after co co he fought Cruz.

3196
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,660
He looks so fucking good.

3197
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:20,811
I was like,

3198
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:21,920
Jesus Christ,

3199
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:22,490
he's good.

3200
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:23,480
It's like a tank.

3201
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,160
Like a tank is fast as fuck.

3202
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:30,161
His boxing is laser beam accurate and
he's getting better and it wasn't better

3203
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:30,980
all the time.

3204
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,940
He's getting better.

3205
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:34,680
He outclass dom and then
you see you can't do that.

3206
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,640
I'm math but I'm going to do it right yet.

3207
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,450
Dom and Tj was a battle something.

3208
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:39,290
Tj One,

3209
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:40,640
I don't know man.

3210
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,020
I just feel like government,

3211
01:26:42,021 --> 01:26:42,290
he's,

3212
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:45,170
he's like a little chuck
Ladell of that weight class.

3213
01:26:45,171 --> 01:26:45,891
Like he lance,

3214
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:47,030
you're fucking in trouble.

3215
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,880
I thought your podcast
with Dominic was amazing.

3216
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,650
I really have so much
respect for that guy.

3217
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:55,730
So he's so intelligent about sorta
fighter's mind and dealing with injuries.

3218
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:56,451
But his injury,

3219
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:59,990
like the amount of injuries
he's had to deal with are crazy.

3220
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:00,640
Like,

3221
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:05,640
like the 10 pulling off his heel and I
mean in the fight crazy shit you guys

3222
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:06,561
have by flags.

3223
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:07,640
Just let her beautiful.

3224
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:08,421
Oh man,

3225
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:09,740
this fight is fucking hot.

3226
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:11,040
Man For Eagle.

3227
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:12,050
Landed a beautiful leg.

3228
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:15,080
Chicken Ray board came back with a leg
kick of his own in a spinning back fist

3229
01:27:15,081 --> 01:27:15,914
behind it.

3230
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,030
I'd like board to do the,

3231
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,530
when the boards of bad motherfucker.

3232
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,720
He's a a bow hunter.

3233
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,140
Big Time.

3234
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:22,370
Uh,

3235
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,810
just one of the things he Paul,

3236
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:24,141
yeah,

3237
01:27:24,141 --> 01:27:24,650
he pulled,

3238
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:25,940
he after his fight,

3239
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:26,774
he uh,

3240
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:27,621
called out,

3241
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:27,860
uh,

3242
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:28,621
John Dudley,

3243
01:27:28,621 --> 01:27:29,331
you just wanted to set,

3244
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:32,040
I wanted to be on your podcast and
I want to go bow hunting with you.

3245
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:33,200
So bow hunting fanatic.

3246
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,263
Damn.

3247
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,560
Yeah.

3248
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,010
GCA.

3249
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:39,650
He doesn't get enough credit because that
in Brazil doing thing and he's small,

3250
01:27:39,651 --> 01:27:41,180
Dj barely gets enough credit.

3251
01:27:41,181 --> 01:27:41,841
So all these guys,

3252
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:42,980
it's a tough go for them.

3253
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:43,910
It's a tough go.

3254
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:45,410
The whole division chair just needs to,

3255
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,300
I think start doing super fights.

3256
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,353
Give you the teacher,

3257
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,223
give them dumb.

3258
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,180
Let's do crazy though.

3259
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:51,430
That like 35,

3260
01:27:51,431 --> 01:27:56,150
he's got so much hype behind it and 25
has almost none because we just don't

3261
01:27:56,151 --> 01:27:57,560
care about those tiny,

3262
01:27:57,561 --> 01:27:58,394
tiny guys.

3263
01:27:58,630 --> 01:27:59,720
10 pounds difference.

3264
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:01,670
She in 25 and 35 of them are funny.

3265
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,900
They are so small.

3266
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:05,390
As long as it's someone smaller
than you will pay attention.

3267
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,460
It's like we know what we
need as a straw weight,

3268
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:08,690
men's division and then Dj,

3269
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:09,130
I'd be like,

3270
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:13,790
he's a little motherfucker fucking
these little tiny 115 pounds.

3271
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,391
I just,

3272
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:16,160
I don't know what djs waiting for for the,

3273
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:17,750
maybe they're not
offering him or whatever.

3274
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,350
He's got it.

3275
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:21,530
Wilson has in his next fight
and after the Wilson fight,

3276
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:23,940
like then what do we do now?

3277
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:26,360
Who's born don't the new owners,

3278
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,770
if you don't,

3279
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:32,000
the new owners of the UFC have
the power to create stars.

3280
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:32,871
They don't,

3281
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:35,150
they like heartless Hollywood.

3282
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,170
Well got to win.

3283
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:37,400
No,

3284
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,630
you don't have to be undefeated.

3285
01:28:38,631 --> 01:28:38,931
It's not,

3286
01:28:38,931 --> 01:28:43,160
not saying you just have to be at
Paige vanzant blow up personalities.

3287
01:28:43,161 --> 01:28:43,491
You know,

3288
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:43,910
just,

3289
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:44,930
you need a small part of it.

3290
01:28:44,931 --> 01:28:47,850
The smaller girls now it's hurt
him in TV show fighter personality.

3291
01:28:47,851 --> 01:28:48,561
It has to be there.

3292
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:49,190
You know,

3293
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,950
like people have got to be able to
talk to you take him there and we just

3294
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:52,950
haven't seen it yet.

3295
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:53,701
Well,

3296
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:55,010
Dj has got a fun personality.

3297
01:28:55,011 --> 01:28:56,180
He's great on podcasts.

3298
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:57,050
He's a fun dude.

3299
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:00,110
It's just people for whatever reason,

3300
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,003
haven't you?

3301
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,880
I appreciated what they're seeing.

3302
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:06,060
Chocolate seat in in the
inbox and they think he's,

3303
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:07,580
if you talked to any boxing,

3304
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:08,760
he's the best in the world.

3305
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:10,110
He fights on triple g's card.

3306
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:12,060
The paper you I think is next weekend.

3307
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:16,770
Does anyone now for Miga?

3308
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:19,200
I think Tj is the most exciting.

3309
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:20,034
What a scrabble.

3310
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:20,911
Oh Shit.

3311
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:22,500
Ray Borg all over it.

3312
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,610
Look at this.

3313
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:27,270
Who's grabbing 20 fibers are mad dogs,

3314
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:27,690
man,

3315
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:29,220
the pace is so insane.

3316
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:32,220
I don't you think that Tj
is the most exciting fight?

3317
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:33,420
Tj,

3318
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:34,800
Tj Dillashaw no,

3319
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:35,250
no,

3320
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:35,730
definitely no.

3321
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:38,340
He's decided to watch,

3322
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:38,910
but he's mostly,

3323
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,070
he's sliding past.

3324
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,480
He's definitely one of Orthodox.

3325
01:29:42,481 --> 01:29:43,021
He's just so,

3326
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:44,520
I mean I see Cody Garbrandt,

3327
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:45,723
Dominick Cruz,

3328
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,220
she rumble Johnson.

3329
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:47,521
Yeah,

3330
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:48,520
but I'm saying exciting like,

3331
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:49,383
cause it just,

3332
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:52,710
he's from angles and just
movements and I dunno man.

3333
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:53,340
He's just,

3334
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:53,431
Oh,

3335
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:54,340
he's access pace.

3336
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:54,780
Great.

3337
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,613
As far as the most,

3338
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,970
one of the best in the world,

3339
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,050
there's no doubt about it.

3340
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,030
And if he can beat Cody.

3341
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:05,300
He's in my pound for pound top five hours
and I think he was when he beat Barao

3342
01:30:05,971 --> 01:30:07,020
the second time I was like,

3343
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:07,141
well,

3344
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:09,450
make an argument for someone
who's higher up the top

3345
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,470
high level off the cage.

3346
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:14,250
That back tag,

3347
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:18,390
it took that back and immediately
went to the body triangle was squeeze.

3348
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:19,410
Everybody does that now.

3349
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,790
Everybody goes to the squeeze,

3350
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:22,380
especially with their camp.

3351
01:30:22,381 --> 01:30:22,801
Think about it.

3352
01:30:22,801 --> 01:30:25,350
He's with Aldo and Barao.

3353
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:26,243
Yeah.

3354
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,260
It's crazy that that was a rare move.

3355
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:33,300
The body triangle was a rare move taking
the Dobie in the late nineties that's

3356
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:34,134
true body.

3357
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:40,050
It's pretty rare up until Ivan salivary
did it and I didn't start doing it and

3358
01:30:40,051 --> 01:30:43,770
putting it into my game heavily until
John John came back from Abu Dhabi and I

3359
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:44,071
felt like,

3360
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:45,780
why did you keep doing a triangle cross?

3361
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:50,310
I can kept holding him like that because
he never really did that in class.

3362
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:51,990
He's just straight hooks and they said,

3363
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:52,351
man,

3364
01:30:52,351 --> 01:30:54,330
so greased so much grace,

3365
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:58,560
they're slipping so I got to lock their
hips slipped down and that's all I need.

3366
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,120
When John Jack says something,

3367
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:04,440
you just to pretty much bank
on it and that's the way to go.

3368
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:07,740
He's ever told me to do
and he kind of direction.

3369
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:08,574
He's pointed me in.

3370
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:08,971
Boom,

3371
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:13,320
I go right to know who I bet has the most
body lock time in the UFC and you can,

3372
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,520
I don't know who would track it.

3373
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:16,650
I would bet Anderson Silva does.

3374
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,060
When you think about with Travis Luder,

3375
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:19,140
Dan Henderson,

3376
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:22,020
that mother fucker spends
a ton of time there.

3377
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,050
A ton of you think about his
flights when they go to the ground.

3378
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,910
It's so hard to get out of man.

3379
01:31:26,911 --> 01:31:28,410
I've never seen anybody get out of it.

3380
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:31,440
Did he get Travis looters back?

3381
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,333
Yes.

3382
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,490
Triangle triangle that
remembered it from the bottom.

3383
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:36,913
You're working here.

3384
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,060
Travis mounted him.

3385
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:39,894
I know,

3386
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:40,910
but it's exhausting.

3387
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:42,270
It's hard to breathe and stuff.

3388
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:43,020
Dude,

3389
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:46,650
that was my best example for the longest
time of a guy that was on death's door

3390
01:31:46,651 --> 01:31:49,620
was Travis when he didn't make weight for
the Anderson Silva fight a title fight

3391
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:55,950
the triangle.

3392
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,183
Yup.

3393
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:02,530
And also being a really tiny
guy and sweaty as fuck and
the third round with two

3394
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:03,364
minutes left.

3395
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,390
These guys move so fast and
they don't get fucking tired.

3396
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:08,190
That's just crazy.

3397
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:08,800
All Day.

3398
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,750
The game is so different for them.

3399
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:12,970
Must they get tired too,

3400
01:32:12,971 --> 01:32:13,580
man,

3401
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:17,120
like I remember when Alibaba routine
off od a Dj and Dj outworked him.

3402
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:18,180
Then it turns out that he was all,

3403
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,950
if you're one 25 around Epl,

3404
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:21,611
probably not for you.

3405
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:22,890
That's probably of the game for a board.

3406
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,580
Gets landed some big shots right here.

3407
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:24,981
Wait,

3408
01:32:24,981 --> 01:32:25,781
Borg is no joke,

3409
01:32:25,781 --> 01:32:26,290
man,

3410
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,123
but neither is for me.

3411
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:28,600
No.

3412
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,610
For me to get to know.

3413
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,750
These are hard.

3414
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:32,260
He brought,

3415
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,780
he busted his face also Sanderson,

3416
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:38,350
Travis looter triangle and
them shit and he's gay.

3417
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:39,430
He's holding the back of his neck.

3418
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,050
He's letting them have that arm bar.

3419
01:32:41,051 --> 01:32:41,381
Look at that.

3420
01:32:41,381 --> 01:32:42,730
He's letting them have that left arm.

3421
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:43,840
He should swing.

3422
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:45,090
He's holding onto his neck.

3423
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:48,790
That's how Randy couture got armbar
against the ensign just holding all that

3424
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:49,870
neck and he's not doing it anymore.

3425
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,790
It's fine right there too.

3426
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:52,361
He has it.

3427
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:52,781
It's open.

3428
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:53,614
He should be swinging.

3429
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:56,610
Just came off him.

3430
01:32:57,090 --> 01:32:57,923
Ooh.

3431
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,700
Oh Shit.

3432
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:03,431
He went for it.

3433
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:04,930
At least he's out of that spot.

3434
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:05,853
Got To give this to book.

3435
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:06,930
This is torque.

3436
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:08,800
Immediately goes back
to the Black Mountain.

3437
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:09,540
Wow.

3438
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:10,373
Glory.

3439
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:16,810
His transitions and those fucking elbows
from the top position are so scary.

3440
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,570
Dude from Megan.

3441
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:20,050
I'm trying right arm triangle right there.

3442
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:21,160
He should just close it off.

3443
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:22,930
Was arms on under yet?

3444
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:24,400
He could have just put it there,

3445
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:25,293
right?

3446
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:27,860
But the other guys got risk
control so you can slide them out.

3447
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,880
Oh scramble.

3448
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:34,130
He still has it right there and he still
has that opportunity for them to turn

3449
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:37,660
the twister pass free the knee and then
slice to three quarter mount just like

3450
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:38,503
Dan.

3451
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:42,340
But this speed of these exchanges is
what you're really supposed to be looking

3452
01:33:42,341 --> 01:33:43,174
for in him.

3453
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:43,760
Oh,

3454
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,593
he's going for it.

3455
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,490
He's going through the choke.

3456
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,211
There it is.

3457
01:33:46,211 --> 01:33:48,700
Five seconds lab and
it's got to go for it.

3458
01:33:48,701 --> 01:33:49,750
A tough guy to chunk.

3459
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,190
Wow.

3460
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:53,650
These guys at this weight
class are so fucking amazing.

3461
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,260
Like this is what MMA supposed to be.

3462
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:00,220
It's supposed to be like movements
without any physical limitations.

3463
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,580
You know,

3464
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:04,450
like you just can't move at this
pace if you weigh 300 pounds.

3465
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:04,960
But,

3466
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,130
but also at that,

3467
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:06,391
you know,

3468
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:06,911
at heavyweight,

3469
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:08,020
the lighter weights,

3470
01:34:08,021 --> 01:34:08,950
the reason why we like it,

3471
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:10,690
because it can end at any given moment.

3472
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:13,210
These chansom getting
finished aren't great.

3473
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:13,511
Yeah.

3474
01:34:13,511 --> 01:34:13,870
I mean,

3475
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:17,590
except for Cody who knocks
guys out with one shot.

3476
01:34:17,591 --> 01:34:18,680
I want the linen person.

3477
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:18,970
Yeah.

3478
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:21,800
One 35 well then I also was wanting,

3479
01:34:21,801 --> 01:34:22,001
I mean,

3480
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:26,110
djs knocked out a few people at 25
and he knocked out Benevidez one pond.

3481
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,800
But the reality is it's way more rare
that weight class to see like a one shot

3482
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:35,660
Kao and that's why it's
not as big as would a draw.

3483
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:36,430
Yeah.

3484
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:39,070
But it's also why those guys
exchanged many more techniques.

3485
01:34:39,071 --> 01:34:41,680
They're not gonna be able to
finish the other off with one shot.

3486
01:34:41,681 --> 01:34:43,780
So everybody's much
more technical oriented,

3487
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:44,660
more Korean.

3488
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:44,891
Cool.

3489
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:45,220
Yeah.

3490
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:45,911
You have to be like,

3491
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:48,070
if you look at these two
guys and these scrambles,

3492
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,210
they're so technical.

3493
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,280
If you had the skills that
heavyweight or two or five,

3494
01:34:51,281 --> 01:34:52,300
it's either of these guys,

3495
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,200
you'd be the greatest fall.

3496
01:34:54,201 --> 01:34:54,810
My Gosh.

3497
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:57,440
Imagine if there was a fucking
heavyweight that move like Ray Borg.

3498
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,550
That would be insane.

3499
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,191
Be Scared,

3500
01:34:59,191 --> 01:34:59,540
Bishop.

3501
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,650
Greatest of all time.

3502
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:01,190
Yeah,

3503
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:03,470
like Ray Borg is a top
10 contender for sure,

3504
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:05,060
but he hasn't got a shot at the title yet.

3505
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,320
He was a heavyweight.

3506
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:06,971
If you've got to,

3507
01:35:06,971 --> 01:35:08,750
if he was a heavyweight to
be the greatest of all time.

3508
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:09,870
If you want to,

3509
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:10,581
if there's anybody who,

3510
01:35:10,581 --> 01:35:11,420
who's like,

3511
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:15,470
if there are any athletes in the other
sports who have that kind of explosion

3512
01:35:15,471 --> 01:35:16,304
speed.

3513
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,293
Dexterity.

3514
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,070
Yeah,

3515
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:19,350
but like,

3516
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:20,183
like take,

3517
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,100
take a Westbrook,

3518
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,220
Russell Westbrook,

3519
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,540
if he'd strange MMA,

3520
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:24,410
Russell Westbrook,

3521
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,370
if he had trained MMA,

3522
01:35:25,371 --> 01:35:25,821
like you know,

3523
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:30,320
since he was 17 it's a chance he could
be a guy that big with that kind of

3524
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:31,154
speed.

3525
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:31,970
They're out there,

3526
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:32,870
they're just not interesting.

3527
01:35:32,871 --> 01:35:36,430
You Punch in the face where they can
make way more money playing football and

3528
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:40,250
shooting them and also they probably
started doing that sport when they were a

3529
01:35:40,251 --> 01:35:40,850
little kid.

3530
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:41,960
You've got amazing at it.

3531
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,930
Transfer over an MMA in 20 years.

3532
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:45,650
We'll see it will,

3533
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:46,910
you'll see a guy like that.

3534
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:47,301
Oh yeah,

3535
01:35:47,301 --> 01:35:47,900
for sure.

3536
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,070
Maybe not the heavier weights.

3537
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,660
They're going to have to want to do it.

3538
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:51,370
That's the thing.

3539
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:53,690
I mean he's going to have to
bring the parents to do it.

3540
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:57,480
To encourage the Johnson
could play NFL fee.

3541
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,420
No,

3542
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,141
not right now,

3543
01:36:00,141 --> 01:36:00,890
but if he,

3544
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:05,020
if he played football in high school and
in College Board has got the frame and

3545
01:36:05,021 --> 01:36:05,530
the,

3546
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:09,040
and the height he'd be safe to,

3547
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:09,883
he'd be a safety.

3548
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:11,240
It's a lot of speculation.

3549
01:36:11,241 --> 01:36:13,330
That's like saying Ray
Lewis was a kickboxer.

3550
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:14,150
He'd be a world champ,

3551
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:16,100
but what I'm saying is you guys
are talking about these athletes.

3552
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:18,650
We already got a feel of it.

3553
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:18,860
Yeah.

3554
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:19,693
John Jones.

3555
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:20,201
John,

3556
01:36:20,201 --> 01:36:20,411
John,

3557
01:36:20,411 --> 01:36:20,621
John,

3558
01:36:20,621 --> 01:36:20,970
John.

3559
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:21,200
No,

3560
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:21,970
John Jones can,

3561
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:22,140
no,

3562
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:22,231
no,

3563
01:36:22,231 --> 01:36:22,371
no.

3564
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:24,140
John Jones wouldn't be
professor nail their sport.

3565
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:25,573
Isn't that funny?

3566
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:26,943
Ask him about it.

3567
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:30,020
He ran the 40 he ran like
a four nine or five flat.

3568
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:30,491
He,

3569
01:36:30,491 --> 01:36:31,670
his brothers is not going to hand.

3570
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:32,780
His brothers are beast.

3571
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,400
She comes my same skills.

3572
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:34,921
It's just,

3573
01:36:34,921 --> 01:36:35,360
dude,

3574
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,290
it's hard to compare it.

3575
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,250
Apples and oranges,

3576
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,410
but it's same.

3577
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,490
It's the same.

3578
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:41,960
You know he's so athletic,

3579
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:42,620
right?

3580
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:42,861
John?

3581
01:36:42,861 --> 01:36:43,041
John,

3582
01:36:43,041 --> 01:36:43,850
we're fighting.

3583
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:44,210
Yes,

3584
01:36:44,210 --> 01:36:45,500
but that trend then fell.

3585
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:46,260
No.

3586
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,120
Well you know what man,

3587
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:47,610
I don't know.

3588
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:49,480
How much time do you
dedicate towards that?

3589
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,630
How much time does it dead court dedicate
towards wrestling and MMA primer on a

3590
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,680
40 or let's just say a sprint.

3591
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,180
If you went against the guy who was,

3592
01:36:56,181 --> 01:36:57,590
he weighed 220 pounds.

3593
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:02,550
If you just ran a sprint against division
one football guys smoking the shit out

3594
01:37:02,551 --> 01:37:02,671
of him.

3595
01:37:02,671 --> 01:37:03,420
That's just,

3596
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:04,610
that's pure athleticism.

3597
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:05,660
But if you played football,

3598
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:10,520
maybe puts on a lot of muscle and a lot
of ways lower defensive and you don't

3599
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:12,350
have to be that fast play in these days.

3600
01:37:12,351 --> 01:37:13,240
You do at the end.

3601
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:14,090
How far can they,

3602
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,520
how do they run for seven forties yeah,

3603
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:22,010
Shit's of Linemen Watch 300 290 pounds
when the four six the at the end,

3604
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:23,990
those guys are freaks.

3605
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,570
They just had a 370 pound guy,

3606
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:29,390
Ron a four seven 43 70 do you see this?

3607
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:34,490
This is [inaudible] 74
standing next to that guy,

3608
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,160
Jamie looked that guy,

3609
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:40,730
if he's have linemen three 70 he
ran a four salmon McCardle did.

3610
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:41,733
It's crazy.

3611
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:43,970
Think about what that would
feel like dealing with,

3612
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:47,450
think about what that would feel like
to be on the field or that guy runs by

3613
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:47,690
you.

3614
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:48,620
That's what he was MVP.

3615
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:49,743
Look at these elbows.

3616
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:54,230
But I mean if you could stand there like
right next to him as he's sprinting,

3617
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,370
just let them run by Sega is feel

3618
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,780
the force whole different thing of
almost 400 pounds running faster than you

3619
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:01,614
ever could hope to.

3620
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:02,850
Yeah.

3621
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:03,683
Scary.

3622
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:08,220
Launching his entire body down the track.

3623
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:12,510
They find that guys who are that big
and that fast actually ended up getting

3624
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:13,620
injured faster.

3625
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:17,820
So bigger and faster in the NFL
according to fight or sports science.

3626
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:19,390
Uh,

3627
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:19,800
Nice.

3628
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,050
Not always better because
you get injured faster.

3629
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:26,020
Well I would imagine there's soft
tissue could only take so much debate.

3630
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,080
They're talking about
like the biggest guys.

3631
01:38:28,590 --> 01:38:28,981
Yeah,

3632
01:38:28,981 --> 01:38:32,640
apparently they did a thing where like
you get huge dudes who are really fast

3633
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:35,940
and somehow they don't last
as long as somebody who is,

3634
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,020
because it's physics.

3635
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:37,231
Right.

3636
01:38:37,231 --> 01:38:39,790
So because your body
can only take so much.

3637
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:41,160
Yeah.

3638
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,990
It depends on the position and
depending on the guy for sure.

3639
01:38:43,991 --> 01:38:44,130
Yeah.

3640
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:48,450
Well it's also the sport itself is
so fucking ruthless on your body.

3641
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:51,120
I mean it just breaks you the injury,

3642
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,610
the injury rate is 100% or something.

3643
01:38:53,611 --> 01:38:55,060
Somebody that somebody
said that like in the NFL,

3644
01:38:55,061 --> 01:38:57,450
like everybody's injured injury.

3645
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,360
I had an area and foster on the podcast
this week and one of the things he said

3646
01:39:00,361 --> 01:39:00,691
is like,

3647
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:01,980
if my kids wanted to play football,

3648
01:39:01,981 --> 01:39:02,281
I'd be like,

3649
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:03,031
fuck that.

3650
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:03,270
You know,

3651
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,103
playing football.

3652
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:04,471
And he goes,

3653
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:08,250
I didn't bust my ass to get to this
position to watch you do that shit.

3654
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:09,130
Yeah.

3655
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:09,310
He's,

3656
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:13,120
you can see how it says that
that guy was a freak done.

3657
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:14,723
He's a freak.

3658
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:16,430
He's amazing fucking monster.

3659
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,273
He's amazing.

3660
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,031
Super Freak.

3661
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:18,481
And he was like,

3662
01:39:18,481 --> 01:39:19,231
I'm tired of it.

3663
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:19,801
And foster.

3664
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:21,630
He led the league in
Russian for a lot of years.

3665
01:39:21,631 --> 01:39:22,170
And yeah,

3666
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:22,860
he,

3667
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:25,110
he was tired because he wanted to,

3668
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:25,261
like,

3669
01:39:25,261 --> 01:39:26,640
he had a bunch of
injuries and he was like,

3670
01:39:26,641 --> 01:39:27,300
this is not,

3671
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:27,840
I don't want to do this.

3672
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,501
He's only 30,

3673
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:28,770
right?

3674
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:29,090
Yup.

3675
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:31,290
He's young primary command.

3676
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:32,820
So this fucking prime right now.

3677
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,590
30 and he decided I'm done.

3678
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,990
Smart for running back
you that it's time to go.

3679
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,610
He's a smart dude.

3680
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:39,870
He's not like,

3681
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:41,460
he's not completely motivated by money.

3682
01:39:41,461 --> 01:39:41,731
He just,

3683
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:43,260
he's not motivated by fame.

3684
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,160
He also got paid.

3685
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:46,620
So it's easy to say that
one aid plenty in the bank.

3686
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:47,341
He's hanging back.

3687
01:39:47,341 --> 01:39:49,470
But he's also being
smart about being paid,

3688
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:50,041
you know,

3689
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:52,800
he doesn't have like $500,000
worth of jewelry on him.

3690
01:39:52,801 --> 01:39:53,310
You know,

3691
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:54,300
he's not being an asshole.

3692
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:58,470
You wonder what Lebron James would
be like in the heavyweight division.

3693
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:00,180
Like too big.

3694
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,780
It's too big to 65 he could
get down and he's 63 he's lead.

3695
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:04,770
How much does he weigh?

3696
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:05,430
Uh,

3697
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,611
no.

3698
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:07,110
I think Melbourne's to 50 now.

3699
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:10,910
Two 53 something like chat look like he,

3700
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,090
he'd gotten some weird diet.

3701
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:12,840
Less a lot of ways.

3702
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,610
Would you say Jamie?

3703
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:16,500
I was saying it as an older guy now
he's Kinda a little bit thinner it,

3704
01:40:16,570 --> 01:40:19,430
it's like two 52 40 best all time.

3705
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,160
The Bron James,

3706
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:20,971
he's a kilo kid.

3707
01:40:20,971 --> 01:40:21,810
I don't know if he officially,

3708
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:24,480
but he has his picture comes up when you
kind of Google something like that and

3709
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:25,930
just all the time the Brown,

3710
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:26,750
the Brown.

3711
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:27,030
No,

3712
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:28,150
Michael Jordan still better.

3713
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:28,680
Oh yeah.

3714
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,420
What does he have to do to surpass him?

3715
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:30,991
Nothing.

3716
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:31,910
There's nothing happening.

3717
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:32,270
What?

3718
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,610
The ones like five more
championships still?

3719
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:35,881
No,

3720
01:40:35,881 --> 01:40:36,541
because you know why?

3721
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:40,140
Because he only wins championships
when he forms these super teams.

3722
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:40,711
You know what I'm saying?

3723
01:40:40,711 --> 01:40:41,544
Like that's a bitch.

3724
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:44,790
Bulls had a super team to man
Pippin and all those guys.

3725
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:45,541
Yeah.

3726
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:47,400
But at the time Jordan was still a beast,

3727
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:47,880
you know,

3728
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,520
like he didn't ask for all that
stuff and they drafted these guys.

3729
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:50,971
It wasn't like,

3730
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:51,240
he was like,

3731
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:51,751
oh magic,

3732
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:52,584
come play with me.

3733
01:40:53,310 --> 01:40:54,040
Here's Jordan

3734
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,430
didn't do,

3735
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,320
he didn't want to ring until,

3736
01:40:56,321 --> 01:40:56,531
what?

3737
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:57,430
The sixth year,

3738
01:40:57,431 --> 01:40:58,420
seventh year or something like that.

3739
01:40:58,421 --> 01:40:58,611
Yeah.

3740
01:40:58,611 --> 01:40:59,680
It's still a monster though.

3741
01:40:59,681 --> 01:41:00,514
You know better

3742
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:03,670
dude,

3743
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:04,810
that is on the cheek.

3744
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:08,920
That is 100% he'll to cheek
hundred percent healed to cheat.

3745
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:09,971
What's his name?

3746
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:10,691
Who was with the red hair?

3747
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:12,810
Thought Felder.

3748
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:14,111
He's a bad ass.

3749
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:15,670
Is he still that's worse than me.

3750
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:15,970
No,

3751
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:16,081
no,

3752
01:41:16,081 --> 01:41:16,180
no,

3753
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:16,730
no,

3754
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:17,190
no.

3755
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:20,170
Can see what the one with with Terry Edom,

3756
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:25,230
it just looks like it's not as bad
because he stiffens up and on impact.

3757
01:41:26,231 --> 01:41:30,280
Its head doesn't snap back but it's cause
he was dad and to those showed again

3758
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,780
dead so on from the,

3759
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,880
from the impact of the heel to the shake.

3760
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:36,710
So muscular live for it.

3761
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,810
It was horrible.

3762
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:40,330
If you watched a video of him
getting wheeled kicked in the back,

3763
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:41,164
you see Ari,

3764
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:42,610
Ari stands up like this.

3765
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,870
Like you said,

3766
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:49,810
he could see the wheel kick land and
Ari's in the background probably on acid.

3767
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:54,430
What do you watch this 10
this is the mega athletes.

3768
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,140
He was an at three sevens.

3769
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:58,610
Their guy was three Oh
seven ran out of sub five.

3770
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:02,570
Does she just this the size of three
Oh six and he ran a four six five,

3771
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:05,170
six pounds.

3772
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:06,800
316 they ran or what?

3773
01:42:06,801 --> 01:42:07,634
Four six five.

3774
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:08,990
Oh my God.

3775
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:10,520
Again,

3776
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,000
watch this.

3777
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,361
Watch this.

3778
01:42:11,361 --> 01:42:11,811
Can I do this?

3779
01:42:11,811 --> 01:42:12,690
This is the Saturday.

3780
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:14,600
What position is this guy?

3781
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:15,920
Gonna plug my mole line.

3782
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,200
He'll be tackle.

3783
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:17,600
Hey,

3784
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:17,990
what?

3785
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:18,360
Uh,

3786
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:20,960
what called you from June to
say that's a weird symbol.

3787
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,280
Holding maybe.

3788
01:42:22,290 --> 01:42:24,110
Maybe it was three Oh
seven nine three three 76.

3789
01:42:24,111 --> 01:42:25,320
Holy Shit.

3790
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:26,173
Was this recent?

3791
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:28,420
Toronto's was a couple of years ago now.

3792
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:30,740
There was a guy who recently
did some crazy shit.

3793
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:31,933
That's incredible.

3794
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,510
I had six wide receivers
speed at 300 pounds.

3795
01:42:35,511 --> 01:42:35,710
Yeah.

3796
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:36,441
Now think about this.

3797
01:42:36,441 --> 01:42:37,130
Look at him.

3798
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:38,190
He should play defense.

3799
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,110
Fuck that offense.

3800
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:39,690
He could,

3801
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:42,940
they could use his speed on defense
playing an offensive lineman.

3802
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:44,060
You don't need speed that

3803
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:47,520
what'd you snuck?

3804
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:49,363
Mafia?

3805
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,050
He,

3806
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:50,750
it would it be,

3807
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:52,760
he could play middle linebacker at that.

3808
01:42:52,761 --> 01:42:53,594
With that speed.

3809
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,700
Imagine him right there in the middle.

3810
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:58,160
Some guy ran the fastest.

3811
01:42:58,161 --> 01:42:59,060
Whenever I think right.

3812
01:42:59,061 --> 01:42:59,894
The shaft,

3813
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:01,150
two to two.

3814
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:02,631
And how about this?

3815
01:43:02,631 --> 01:43:02,841
You know,

3816
01:43:02,841 --> 01:43:03,140
if he,

3817
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:04,280
if he broke the record,

3818
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:04,541
well,

3819
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:05,780
Adidas gave this challenge to go.

3820
01:43:05,781 --> 01:43:06,710
Anyone who breaks the record,

3821
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:09,830
they're going to give you an island
of your choice and $1 million,

3822
01:43:09,831 --> 01:43:11,030
but you have to do an Adidas.

3823
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,770
This whole brand in Nike.

3824
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:13,604
So he didn't get it.

3825
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:17,120
So sad they were going
to give them an island.

3826
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:17,290
Oh,

3827
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:18,123
fucking island.

3828
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:19,940
Off The coast of Japan or some shit.

3829
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:20,600
Nah,

3830
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,440
he could pick.

3831
01:43:21,441 --> 01:43:22,850
It was like five different islands.

3832
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:23,471
They asked to when it,

3833
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:23,781
dude,

3834
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,110
you could want an island
because I don't know about it.

3835
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,680
I can't swim so I don't care.

3836
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:29,573
Well,

3837
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:30,870
right.

3838
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:32,840
Is that how are on a
boat and I can't swim.

3839
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,081
Just give me the money.

3840
01:43:37,081 --> 01:43:37,210
No,

3841
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:37,930
give me an island.

3842
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:40,130
Whose Bisbing the cold GSP.

3843
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:41,550
That's right.

3844
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:42,383
Come on son.

3845
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:43,343
These things you're eating.

3846
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:44,640
These are backpack from meals.

3847
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,910
I got the guy who was
coming on my podcast.

3848
01:43:47,911 --> 01:43:48,744
It's um,

3849
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:52,850
it's called a green belly meals and
they have like a ton of calories.

3850
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,990
I was going to say a ton of calories.

3851
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:54,824
If you're hiking,

3852
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,600
it's got a ton of carbs in it too though.

3853
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:57,140
These are not,

3854
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:58,130
these are non Kido.

3855
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,490
This isn't going to take some
exogenous ketones afterwards.

3856
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:02,300
But um,

3857
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:03,560
if you just have like half of it,

3858
01:44:03,561 --> 01:44:04,394
you're good.

3859
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:07,310
Half of it as 25 grams and
we going to shit my pants.

3860
01:44:07,311 --> 01:44:08,400
It was like $1,000.

3861
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:09,560
No it's not.

3862
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:10,400
But it's very dense,

3863
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:13,640
very dense and heavy perform
tonight at the comedy store.

3864
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:16,730
Backpackers like to take these
things with them because they're,

3865
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:17,000
um,

3866
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,930
they're really nutrient
dense and there um,

3867
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:20,020
yeah,

3868
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,360
yeah,

3869
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:23,090
there's a bunch of the back third of the,

3870
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:23,993
um,

3871
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:25,760
did he go into the back?

3872
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:26,321
Going to the,

3873
01:44:26,321 --> 01:44:26,860
to the,

3874
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:27,261
to the room.

3875
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:27,920
I'll go one third.

3876
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,790
Daily nutrition,

3877
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:29,241
protein,

3878
01:44:29,241 --> 01:44:29,751
calories,

3879
01:44:29,751 --> 01:44:30,261
fiber,

3880
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:31,094
fats.

3881
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:31,881
I don't know why.

3882
01:44:31,881 --> 01:44:34,400
We just don't know where that
God damn pizza sometimes.

3883
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:34,580
You know,

3884
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,413
and I agree with you.

3885
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:39,230
I just don't know how Tapioca Sarah was.

3886
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,064
The first ingredient.

3887
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:41,200
Can't eat into the mic.

3888
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:43,170
We can't have cheese in your fucking

3889
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:46,460
what if you're eating?

3890
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:47,091
You're not talking.

3891
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:48,320
I know we can't have that.

3892
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:49,400
That's,

3893
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,670
or maybe we have it delivered Africa,

3894
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,553
Africa.

3895
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,693
I ain't eating them

3896
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,660
cranberry almond.

3897
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:07,090
Ooh,

3898
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:08,050
that's pretty tasty.

3899
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:08,590
Yeah,

3900
01:45:08,590 --> 01:45:12,190
that's just an ad for green belly meals.

3901
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:13,300
I'll just tell you right now,

3902
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:16,660
I have no affiliation with these
people who's not an advertisement.

3903
01:45:16,661 --> 01:45:17,770
I don't make any money from it.

3904
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:18,640
I bought it.

3905
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,020
I paid for it with American money,

3906
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,680
American mark about it.

3907
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:25,510
Or listen to him on a podcast,

3908
01:45:25,511 --> 01:45:26,800
the rich outdoors podcasts,

3909
01:45:26,801 --> 01:45:27,790
a hunting podcast.

3910
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:29,740
Who is the strength
coach you've talked to?

3911
01:45:29,741 --> 01:45:31,450
Do you think that you've
gotten the most from

3912
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,030
because you've talked to a lot of them.

3913
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:34,961
You know,

3914
01:45:34,961 --> 01:45:35,320
I'm,

3915
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:35,801
I've got,

3916
01:45:35,801 --> 01:45:37,840
I got a lot from Steve Maxwell for sure.

3917
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:38,680
Um,

3918
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:42,350
I've got a lot from listening
to Pablo Tatsu Lean,

3919
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:43,120
uh,

3920
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,060
talk on other podcasts
and talk on audio books.

3921
01:45:46,061 --> 01:45:47,230
And I've read his books too.

3922
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:49,860
I feel like him,

3923
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:50,260
he's a,

3924
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,130
he's a big one.

3925
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:52,533
Um,

3926
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,190
uh,

3927
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:55,000
Keith Webber,

3928
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,110
we've had Keith Weber on the show.

3929
01:45:56,111 --> 01:45:58,630
He's the guy that has an extreme
kettlebell cardio workout.

3930
01:45:58,920 --> 01:45:59,090
Uh,

3931
01:45:59,090 --> 01:45:59,801
the DVDs.

3932
01:45:59,801 --> 01:46:00,461
He's got three of them.

3933
01:46:00,461 --> 01:46:01,660
They're fucking insane.

3934
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:02,980
They're so hard to do.

3935
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:07,930
He doing with one 45 pound kettle bell
and they'll kick your ass at the end of

3936
01:46:07,931 --> 01:46:08,220
the,

3937
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:08,690
uh,

3938
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,720
like 45 minutes,

3939
01:46:10,721 --> 01:46:11,351
I think 40,

3940
01:46:11,351 --> 01:46:11,711
40,

3941
01:46:11,711 --> 01:46:12,544
44 minutes.

3942
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:13,340
Do you think,

3943
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:14,620
do you train less?

3944
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:14,921
Do you,

3945
01:46:14,921 --> 01:46:15,191
are you,

3946
01:46:15,191 --> 01:46:15,430
uh,

3947
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:18,490
Eddie put your headphones on so you
realize how loud opening that bag back and

3948
01:46:18,491 --> 01:46:19,060
forth is.

3949
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:23,530
Are you somebody now who believes in
training less than you did from talking to

3950
01:46:23,531 --> 01:46:23,981
those guys?

3951
01:46:23,981 --> 01:46:26,140
As in our most people ever trained,

3952
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:27,580
this is what I think the,

3953
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:32,230
what Pablo has going on is something
that he calls greasing the groove.

3954
01:46:32,231 --> 01:46:34,240
And what he believes is you
should never go to failure.

3955
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:34,811
He's like,

3956
01:46:34,811 --> 01:46:36,400
your body is not designed
to go to failure.

3957
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,473
If you're doing,

3958
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:38,200
uh,

3959
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,060
like let's say if you're,

3960
01:46:39,061 --> 01:46:42,160
you're doing something that you could
do 10 reps with it and then at 10,

3961
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:43,023
you're like,

3962
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:46,690
you should do five mm and they should
walk away for five to 10 minutes.

3963
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,740
Really do another five.

3964
01:46:47,741 --> 01:46:47,951
Yeah,

3965
01:46:47,951 --> 01:46:50,850
because if you're trying to get strong
when you're trying to get strong,

3966
01:46:50,851 --> 01:46:55,050
the way you do it is continue to do those
motions correctly with full strength.

3967
01:46:55,051 --> 01:46:55,884
And full,

3968
01:46:55,930 --> 01:46:56,490
you know,

3969
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:59,040
full balance and full
control of the kettle bell,

3970
01:46:59,041 --> 01:47:00,210
full control of the dumb bell,

3971
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:00,541
whatever.

3972
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:00,870
We,

3973
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:01,260
you know,

3974
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:04,780
if you're doing clean and press where
they doing dead lifts with full control so

3975
01:47:04,781 --> 01:47:05,041
that you're,

3976
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:07,440
you're lifting with perfect technique,

3977
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:08,040
right.

3978
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:11,820
And then take a long time off so that
when you come back 10 minutes later your

3979
01:47:11,821 --> 01:47:13,710
body is on 100% recovered.

3980
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:17,880
So you're not like still dying from the
last set that you did 30 seconds ago.

3981
01:47:17,881 --> 01:47:18,181
Come on,

3982
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:18,720
push it,

3983
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,141
push it.

3984
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:19,974
Push it

3985
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:21,541
though.

3986
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:22,000
Right.

3987
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,460
That's just what we're talking about.

3988
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:24,180
Strengths.

3989
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:25,680
We're not talking about cardio.

3990
01:47:25,681 --> 01:47:26,580
If she wanted to do cardio,

3991
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:27,450
your muscle building.

3992
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:30,360
Well cause he's gonna bill you for sure.

3993
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,250
Going to build a lot of
muscle if you get stronger.

3994
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:35,550
But there's a big difference between
that and the hypertrophy if you are,

3995
01:47:35,551 --> 01:47:37,410
if you're trying to just gain weight,

3996
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,650
he would trying to just get your
muscles bigger and do like bodybuilding

3997
01:47:40,651 --> 01:47:41,484
exercises.

3998
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,230
A lot of those dudes like to do pyramids.

3999
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:47,520
They'll stack up the weight real high
and then they dropped the weight down and

4000
01:47:47,521 --> 01:47:49,740
continue the reps until they
have like almost no way,

4001
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:50,610
you know.

4002
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:55,260
But you know there's real questions as
to whether or not that's a smart way to

4003
01:47:55,261 --> 01:47:56,610
train as an athlete.

4004
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:57,421
And the,

4005
01:47:57,421 --> 01:47:59,970
the idea being is that as an athlete,

4006
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,090
say if you have a brutal strength and
conditioning workout where you're doing

4007
01:48:03,091 --> 01:48:05,040
everything to fail your
dead lifts to failure,

4008
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:06,480
a clean press to failure,

4009
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:07,890
curls to failure,

4010
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:08,461
but you know,

4011
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:12,270
overhead press to failure
the next day you're useless,

4012
01:48:12,271 --> 01:48:13,090
man,

4013
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:13,923
you're useless.

4014
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,900
You're not going to be able to spar,

4015
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:16,771
you're not going to be able to,

4016
01:48:16,771 --> 01:48:16,900
dude,

4017
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,221
you just,

4018
01:48:17,221 --> 01:48:18,090
you're going to get mauled.

4019
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:19,500
But there's different phases for that.

4020
01:48:19,501 --> 01:48:20,910
I feel like there could be,

4021
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:22,020
that's one way of looking at it.

4022
01:48:22,021 --> 01:48:27,021
But his way of looking at it is you do
these workouts where you lift a small

4023
01:48:27,211 --> 01:48:27,691
percentage,

4024
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:29,550
like half of what your,

4025
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:33,720
what your actual Max would be in terms
of repetitions and just take 10 minutes

4026
01:48:33,721 --> 01:48:34,950
off and then do that again.

4027
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:36,000
10 10 minutes off.

4028
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:36,480
Yup.

4029
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,620
And take a long time off.

4030
01:48:37,621 --> 01:48:38,454
And do that again.

4031
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:41,910
And by that way you leave and you
still have a lot left in the tank.

4032
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:42,601
You walk it,

4033
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:44,130
these guys are fucking going at it.

4034
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,970
Got down.

4035
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:45,330
Yup.

4036
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:46,250
Edson Barboza,

4037
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:47,001
Benito diary,

4038
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:50,030
which are throwing down days
just coming straight food.

4039
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:51,060
What was his car?

4040
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,350
What about maxing out though?

4041
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:53,640
What did they talk about with that?

4042
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:54,630
You don't believe you should do it.

4043
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:57,010
I mean you might want to do it every
now and then just to find out where you

4044
01:48:57,011 --> 01:48:57,840
stand,

4045
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,230
but it's not something that you should
do on a regular basis for a workout.

4046
01:49:01,231 --> 01:49:05,130
Because I feel like a lot of sports are
where you're maxing out your trying your

4047
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:05,970
hardest if you're,

4048
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:08,130
if you're fighting for sure if you're,

4049
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:08,730
you know.

4050
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:10,380
So it seems kind of intuitive,

4051
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:10,860
like safe.

4052
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,280
Why does it seem counterintuitive?

4053
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:13,350
If you're doing strength,

4054
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,320
if you're wrestling or you're
doing Jiu Jitsu or you know,

4055
01:49:16,321 --> 01:49:17,940
a lot of times if you watch these guys,

4056
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:20,190
they're spending a long time doing,

4057
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:25,080
using their entire body and sort of
probably in a maximum effort position,

4058
01:49:25,081 --> 01:49:25,914
right?

4059
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:27,600
So,

4060
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,170
so if you're trying to get out
of a body lock or you're okay,

4061
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:31,711
you know what I mean?

4062
01:49:31,711 --> 01:49:33,480
Or you in the class you stuff failure.

4063
01:49:33,481 --> 01:49:35,100
When do you ever go to failure in a sport?

4064
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:36,743
Um,

4065
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:39,360
well I don't,

4066
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,080
I guess you don't,

4067
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,910
you don't really go to
muscle failure in a sport.

4068
01:49:41,911 --> 01:49:43,320
Where you do is you
want to make sure those,

4069
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:46,680
those muscles are strong and then
you went to build up your technique.

4070
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,320
Oh,

4071
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:47,780
hi.

4072
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:48,050
Kicked

4073
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:48,231
by.

4074
01:49:48,231 --> 01:49:49,064
Barboza.

4075
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:49,440
Wow.

4076
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,140
Do you want to build up your technique
and your endurance in the sport itself?

4077
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:55,360
Like your ability to
do rounds as a fighter,

4078
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:55,720
right?

4079
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,300
Grounds rolling in Jujitsu or what else?

4080
01:49:58,360 --> 01:49:59,193
Whatever else.

4081
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,220
Other sport you're doing,

4082
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:03,700
your real endurance training is
probably going to come from sprints.

4083
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:06,610
You're real endurance training is going
to come from something different outside

4084
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:08,230
of strength training that you're doing.

4085
01:50:08,231 --> 01:50:11,560
The sport itself is doing a
sport itself or then again,

4086
01:50:11,561 --> 01:50:13,390
there's also argument for plyometrics,

4087
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:15,670
which is a a great thing to do,

4088
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:19,120
which is also sort of the same kind of
result that you're getting from movement

4089
01:50:19,121 --> 01:50:20,870
training from a lot of
other things that people,

4090
01:50:20,871 --> 01:50:21,671
what's plyometrics,

4091
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:22,301
explosives,

4092
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:23,350
jump box jumps,

4093
01:50:23,351 --> 01:50:24,220
jumping over hurdles.

4094
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:27,160
If I said you can only do five exercises,

4095
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:28,500
what would I say?

4096
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:28,800
I'd say,

4097
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,380
why?

4098
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,520
Because let's just say,

4099
01:50:30,521 --> 01:50:33,610
can I do five one of the five months when
you writing a strength condition book,

4100
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,510
I would say you should do more than five
things because people don't have that

4101
01:50:37,511 --> 01:50:38,170
much time.

4102
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,820
It's fucking people need
to go fuck themselves.

4103
01:50:39,821 --> 01:50:40,390
Squats,

4104
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:41,051
push ups,

4105
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:41,890
pull ups,

4106
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:44,350
don't ask any stupid questions.

4107
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,200
Back squats,

4108
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,113
dead lifts.

4109
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,071
I'd say squats,

4110
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:48,491
dead lifts,

4111
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:51,430
Chin ups are huge and I think
weighted chin ups or even more huge.

4112
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:53,620
I'm a big believer in way to chin ups.

4113
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:55,240
I love putting a one of those,

4114
01:50:55,241 --> 01:50:59,050
a dip belts on with a kettle
bell in between my legs
and doing chin ups that way

4115
01:50:59,051 --> 01:50:59,700
because it makes my,

4116
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:04,420
my Max Chin ups go way higher and I
do them with strict form none of that.

4117
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:07,990
That airy fairy United to
kick cross fell into Kipp.

4118
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:09,460
Him being not kipper.

4119
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:09,650
No,

4120
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:10,210
I'm not kidding.

4121
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:11,620
I had you pegged as a kept my brother.

4122
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:12,341
You know what I think?

4123
01:51:12,341 --> 01:51:17,140
I think she'd be able to do strict form
pull ups and find out how much endurance

4124
01:51:17,141 --> 01:51:20,290
you actually have in your arms without
moving your legs with it and everything

4125
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:25,291
else strict in the strong first and
paddles a organization you have to be able

4126
01:51:26,741 --> 01:51:29,170
to do straight pull ups like,

4127
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:30,490
like from the bottom,

4128
01:51:30,610 --> 01:51:34,320
full extension damp annealed Irish with
a big kick to the body is bullying him.

4129
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:36,040
He's going straight forward
and let him tee off.

4130
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:37,690
This is a crazy ass fight.

4131
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,830
Nice knee to the body.

4132
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:39,890
I feel it.

4133
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:42,840
Diarrhea sambal guy or a a a Greco guy.

4134
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:44,590
So richly to black belt in Jujitsu.

4135
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,340
Jujitsu is nasty and he's
a hot field corp students.

4136
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,320
Amazing.

4137
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:49,840
Ooh,

4138
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,230
kick to the body by Barboza
Barboza so fucking fast.

4139
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:55,150
[inaudible] man.

4140
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,520
Which when the standup game,

4141
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:58,960
I don't know about all that.

4142
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,430
It's close by.

4143
01:52:00,431 --> 01:52:02,080
Bose has been fighting a long time,

4144
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:02,890
I feel like.

4145
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:03,311
Oh,

4146
01:52:03,311 --> 01:52:04,210
lefthand by dairy.

4147
01:52:04,211 --> 01:52:05,260
Who's nice.

4148
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:10,150
The thing about Barboza is he can just
always turn out the lights with one shot.

4149
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,620
He's explosive.

4150
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:12,820
He's,

4151
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:16,630
and he also does a lot of wild shit like
head kicks and things that can take you

4152
01:52:16,631 --> 01:52:17,411
out there.

4153
01:52:17,411 --> 01:52:18,330
She's the underdog.

4154
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,500
I liked him as an underdog.

4155
01:52:19,501 --> 01:52:20,380
If I was betting on it,

4156
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,060
it felt still fighting.

4157
01:52:22,061 --> 01:52:22,820
I haven't seen him.

4158
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:23,010
Yeah.

4159
01:52:23,010 --> 01:52:23,340
Wow.

4160
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:23,550
Yeah.

4161
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:25,060
Just one killer.

4162
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:29,140
You know he majored in theater
school inside leg kick.

4163
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:29,510
Who did?

4164
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:30,343
Felder just fought.

4165
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,353
Just fought.

4166
01:52:31,370 --> 01:52:32,830
Where did I learn to speak English?

4167
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:37,120
I was case that with that he
took a little time on our boss,

4168
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:38,650
but he did when his last fight did he not?

4169
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:39,633
I believe he did.

4170
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:40,871
Is it fun?

4171
01:52:40,871 --> 01:52:41,401
A little bit.

4172
01:52:41,401 --> 01:52:42,340
The Smart Guy Man.

4173
01:52:42,341 --> 01:52:43,240
Really smart guy

4174
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:47,570
up 19th and beat Alisandra Ricci.

4175
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:48,463
There we go.

4176
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:49,363
Thank you.

4177
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:51,140
He's tough as shit.

4178
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:56,660
He took off so bought in flinch month ago.

4179
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:57,583
Jesus.

4180
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:58,371
Oh,

4181
01:52:58,371 --> 01:52:59,870
those kids are so hellish.

4182
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:00,803
Aw

4183
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:02,641
Yeah.

4184
01:53:02,641 --> 01:53:03,001
Barbara is,

4185
01:53:03,001 --> 01:53:04,710
it might be the best kicker
in this fucking division.

4186
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,340
Wow.

4187
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,380
You really saw that in the
PR in the Pettis fight.

4188
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:10,720
Can you think of another bet
who would be a better kicker?

4189
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:12,990
No Damn Damn.

4190
01:53:12,991 --> 01:53:13,801
But you know guys,

4191
01:53:13,801 --> 01:53:14,460
take it.

4192
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:15,500
Look at this pod.

4193
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,120
Jamie Varner fight.

4194
01:53:17,170 --> 01:53:18,003
Holy Shit.

4195
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:20,350
Like wonder boy.

4196
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:22,500
He is a phenomenal kick
it different though.

4197
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:24,240
As far as like leg kicks,

4198
01:53:25,050 --> 01:53:25,883
body cakes.

4199
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:27,930
Barboza is number one for me.

4200
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:30,753
No,

4201
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,480
it's pretty goddamn good
while eating over here.

4202
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:37,510
I'm trying to think of
the really good kickers,

4203
01:53:37,511 --> 01:53:38,500
but as far as that,

4204
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:39,040
yeah,

4205
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:39,140
I,

4206
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:41,970
I'll see cowboys amazing with this setups.

4207
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,600
I just feel like Barboza and then yeah,

4208
01:53:43,601 --> 01:53:45,760
your Rodriguez on another universe do.

4209
01:53:45,761 --> 01:53:46,630
How about him and

4210
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:49,960
huge jump.

4211
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:55,240
That's such a big leap
for a Dominick Cruz.

4212
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,090
His point about how Frankie Edgar is,

4213
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,580
you see a lot of fighters
at once they start losing,

4214
01:54:00,610 --> 01:54:01,660
they never recover.

4215
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:05,710
And then you see certain fighters like
Frankie Edgar who even though they look

4216
01:54:05,711 --> 01:54:06,610
like they're down and out,

4217
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:09,160
always find a way to
come back in the fight.

4218
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:10,030
Yeah,

4219
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:10,241
yeah.

4220
01:54:10,241 --> 01:54:11,040
There certain fighters,

4221
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:11,261
you know,

4222
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:11,681
once they,

4223
01:54:11,681 --> 01:54:13,060
somebody else gets the advantage they,

4224
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:13,983
you know,

4225
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:16,930
they tend to not be able to
kind of come back from it.

4226
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:20,440
And guys like frank cake
or coffee all over myself.

4227
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:21,970
That's great.

4228
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:24,130
This a coffee thing,

4229
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:26,440
something happens with
it when you press it.

4230
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:29,230
Oh is that two full rang out?

4231
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:30,700
A lot of pressure built up Joe.

4232
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:31,181
Yeah,

4233
01:54:31,181 --> 01:54:33,920
but why is it so I need to,

4234
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:34,721
it's physics.

4235
01:54:34,721 --> 01:54:36,810
I need a pointer in a
fucking carbon black board.

4236
01:54:36,850 --> 01:54:37,030
Oh,

4237
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:38,020
you wouldn't be faking.

4238
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:38,970
I could show you dude.

4239
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:39,610
You don't know.

4240
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:42,850
You don't know how much physics I
had to at least guys are banging man.

4241
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:43,511
Yeah.

4242
01:54:43,511 --> 01:54:43,751
I like,

4243
01:54:43,751 --> 01:54:44,190
how dare you.

4244
01:54:44,190 --> 01:54:45,180
She's being aggressive going,

4245
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:46,083
God.

4246
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:49,120
Oh my God.

4247
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:51,730
What the fuck is he wearing?

4248
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:52,840
An invisible helmet.

4249
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:53,350
Oh,

4250
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,830
Brian,

4251
01:54:53,830 --> 01:54:55,900
you should write for some
sort of a badge sitcoms.

4252
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:56,763
Thanks buddy.

4253
01:54:57,850 --> 01:54:58,540
Is that a compliment?

4254
01:54:58,540 --> 01:54:59,373
I hope so.

4255
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:00,490
I can never figure it out.

4256
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:00,971
What is he wearing?

4257
01:55:00,971 --> 01:55:01,970
Some sort of a helmet.

4258
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:03,430
Helmet.

4259
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:04,570
If that was in a movie,

4260
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:05,231
I'd be like,

4261
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:06,370
what kind of Douche bag?

4262
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:10,060
I wasn't doing a movie in the way
then the movie warrior guys get it.

4263
01:55:10,061 --> 01:55:10,480
Please.

4264
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,313
I might see a penny.

4265
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,450
It was amazing when you
brought out the fish bowl.

4266
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:14,621
I don't want to talk about it.

4267
01:55:14,621 --> 01:55:15,170
Right.

4268
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:15,760
I was like,

4269
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:16,593
if you ever,

4270
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:18,070
ever in a script,

4271
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:18,961
I've never seen it.

4272
01:55:18,961 --> 01:55:20,530
If someone brought that up
in a scrub and I'd be like,

4273
01:55:20,531 --> 01:55:20,741
Hey,

4274
01:55:20,741 --> 01:55:21,460
see this part?

4275
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:22,240
No,

4276
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,050
absolutely not.

4277
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:23,570
No.

4278
01:55:23,570 --> 01:55:23,830
Yeah,

4279
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:24,663
that's,

4280
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:26,530
that's the part I get
the most compliments on.

4281
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:27,071
Oh,

4282
01:55:27,071 --> 01:55:27,450
world.

4283
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:28,880
Cause who are you hanging out with?

4284
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:29,591
Let's not talk to you.

4285
01:55:29,591 --> 01:55:30,424
I don't want to talk about

4286
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:33,173
other actors,

4287
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:33,971
other actors,

4288
01:55:33,971 --> 01:55:34,804
Bro.

4289
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:35,820
Hey,

4290
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:36,653
uh,

4291
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,130
other just nine

4292
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,390
Barboza was five.

4293
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:46,430
I got to come on.

4294
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:47,330
I got to come out in the hallway.

4295
01:55:47,490 --> 01:55:49,100
I'm at night busy.

4296
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:50,423
Never matched it up.

4297
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:51,443
Oof.

4298
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:51,870
Okay.

4299
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:52,980
Damn dirty.

4300
01:55:52,990 --> 01:55:56,070
She's put that down to a single aw,

4301
01:55:56,130 --> 01:56:00,770
great takedown defense
by Barboza Swanson above.

4302
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:02,340
That is a weird fight,

4303
01:56:02,341 --> 01:56:02,581
man.

4304
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:03,660
Such a random fight.

4305
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:06,570
I mean Swanson's like what is your rank
number five or something like that.

4306
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:07,350
Yeah,

4307
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:09,360
and low balled wasn't even top 20 no,

4308
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:10,260
it's so,

4309
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:13,650
it was like talking shit to him
then maybe pulled the Connor flag,

4310
01:56:13,651 --> 01:56:14,484
you know?

4311
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:15,031
It's like,

4312
01:56:15,031 --> 01:56:15,220
Hey,

4313
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:15,901
counters my boy.

4314
01:56:15,901 --> 01:56:16,734
Like I do it.

4315
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:18,660
That's a weird fight though.

4316
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:19,890
It's a weird random as fuck.

4317
01:56:19,891 --> 01:56:20,401
If you're a cub,

4318
01:56:20,401 --> 01:56:21,061
what's it do for you?

4319
01:56:21,061 --> 01:56:21,780
I guess,

4320
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:22,370
you know,

4321
01:56:22,370 --> 01:56:23,200
it keeps him busy,

4322
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:23,640
makes them look,

4323
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,331
you're a superstar.

4324
01:56:24,331 --> 01:56:24,900
If he wins,

4325
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:25,920
maybe lose.

4326
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,150
Do you get in better shape,

4327
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:32,880
but even him,

4328
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:33,630
you know what I mean?

4329
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:34,830
That's the thing about Barboza.

4330
01:56:34,831 --> 01:56:36,630
As good as his fucking technique is,

4331
01:56:36,631 --> 01:56:38,010
as good as his kickboxing is,

4332
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,330
he still gets tagged.

4333
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:40,660
Everybody gets tagged.

4334
01:56:40,661 --> 01:56:42,330
This is a brutal goddamn sport.

4335
01:56:42,610 --> 01:56:43,380
Yep.

4336
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:44,213
Fucking canvas.

4337
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:44,521
Yeah.

4338
01:56:44,521 --> 01:56:44,740
I mean,

4339
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,541
as good as he is,

4340
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:49,200
as good as Barboza is the
messiest canvas I've seen a lot.

4341
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,600
Usually they clean that shit up for farms.

4342
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:54,030
They spray it won a Tony
for fights right there.

4343
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:54,770
This is Fox.

4344
01:56:54,770 --> 01:56:59,770
Oh this is fs one fs one is not nearly
the reach that big Fox as if that was big

4345
01:56:59,941 --> 01:57:00,600
Fox.

4346
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,400
They wouldn't have to torture us man.

4347
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:05,490
It's one of the reasons why I hated
doing big Fox is cause they would get out

4348
01:57:05,491 --> 01:57:09,600
there with spray paint and they would
spray paint the fucking color on the

4349
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:12,150
octagon all over that
gray area and non toxic.

4350
01:57:12,151 --> 01:57:12,660
I'm sure.

4351
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:15,030
Oh it's brutal it but blow
right over to your face.

4352
01:57:15,031 --> 01:57:16,920
You knew you were breathing
in some horrible shit.

4353
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:20,340
She's using real spray paint.

4354
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,203
Yes.

4355
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,200
It's totally illegal.

4356
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:25,440
I guarantee you it's some shit that they
would do if they were like working on a

4357
01:57:25,441 --> 01:57:26,340
car somewhere.

4358
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:28,980
You know it's terrible primer.

4359
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,350
I don't know who authorized it.

4360
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:33,000
I don't know why they
were allowed to do it.

4361
01:57:33,001 --> 01:57:38,001
But we would be sitting there cage side
and toxic fucking fumes from spray paint

4362
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:42,750
or being blasted all over that
canvas calling it the flood.

4363
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:43,560
Yes.

4364
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,610
They see want to see the blood cause
they didn't want him to let go.

4365
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:46,381
My God.

4366
01:57:46,381 --> 01:57:47,490
People on Big Fox.

4367
01:57:47,491 --> 01:57:49,230
They didn't want to admit
what they're setting up.

4368
01:57:49,231 --> 01:57:49,971
God Damn it.

4369
01:57:49,971 --> 01:57:50,804
A bloody sport.

4370
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:54,600
So you'd be sitting there doing
commentary and you'd be coughing.

4371
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:57,240
You'd have to like pull your shirt
up above your face like this.

4372
01:57:57,241 --> 01:57:58,350
Like fucking Amen.

4373
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,820
And the guys who are doing the sound,

4374
01:57:59,821 --> 01:58:00,061
we're like,

4375
01:58:00,061 --> 01:58:01,350
this is fucking brutal.

4376
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,580
I can't believe they're doing this sucks
that these guys are just coming out

4377
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:07,490
this fucking Daria.

4378
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,333
She's like,

4379
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:08,970
go.

4380
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:10,050
Hey God damn,

4381
01:58:10,051 --> 01:58:11,220
he's good damn diary.

4382
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:12,780
She looks real smooth on his feet.

4383
01:58:14,490 --> 01:58:15,840
The thing about Barboza though,

4384
01:58:15,841 --> 01:58:17,220
you've got to always wonder,

4385
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:21,210
you got to always wonder when he's
going to uncork something on you.

4386
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:24,560
He's got such good footwork too,

4387
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:25,100
ma'am.

4388
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:25,830
Yeah he does.

4389
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:27,240
That's that Mark Henry Man.

4390
01:58:27,390 --> 01:58:28,740
Cause he wasn't always like this

4391
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:30,833
damn

4392
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,250
well he used to be a little more

4393
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,193
dag.

4394
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:37,510
My

4395
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:38,343
God.

4396
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:39,850
Oh my God.

4397
01:58:39,851 --> 01:58:40,661
Like you just said,

4398
01:58:40,661 --> 01:58:42,280
he's like you just said

4399
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:44,500
you shut up and said,

4400
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:47,460
Oh shit that Mario Yamasaki the raft.

4401
01:58:47,461 --> 01:58:51,340
Do you see him come fucking bulldog.

4402
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:52,070
Amen.

4403
01:58:52,070 --> 01:58:52,903
Amen.

4404
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:54,483
Zacky ahead.

4405
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:57,370
Cause he didn't want to
get timing on that knee.

4406
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:58,570
That's Mark Henry.

4407
01:58:59,140 --> 01:58:59,870
Powerful market.

4408
01:58:59,870 --> 01:59:00,703
Are you kidding?

4409
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:01,400
Good.

4410
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:02,233
Lower.

4411
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:03,370
Yup.

4412
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:03,850
Nice.

4413
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:04,031
Oh,

4414
01:59:04,031 --> 01:59:08,590
I can't wait to see this replay
with the fucking knee was insane.

4415
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:09,040
He's all right.

4416
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:12,020
I want to know what the Fuck
Mario runs in the 40 [inaudible].

4417
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:13,550
How fast that was with TC.

4418
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:15,550
I've never seen a react that way,

4419
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:16,781
man.

4420
01:59:16,781 --> 01:59:18,840
I'm man ticketless.

4421
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:19,650
Here it is.

4422
01:59:19,650 --> 01:59:21,500
What was the left knee jumping knee?

4423
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:22,460
I don't even remember it.

4424
01:59:22,461 --> 01:59:23,294
Look at this.

4425
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:25,493
Jan there

4426
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,960
looked like he was going to look

4427
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,060
and cluck off as good for that RAF.

4428
01:59:34,061 --> 01:59:35,260
That's great job on that.

4429
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:38,680
That blog fucking that
wasn't Yamazaki it was,

4430
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,780
I can't tell Mario he's got amazing.

4431
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:42,163
No,

4432
01:59:42,330 --> 01:59:43,100
no,

4433
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:44,990
that's not my

4434
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,460
best friends I haven't seen.

4435
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,090
Yeah.

4436
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:50,070
Well we'll see.

4437
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,220
There are free when we see them

4438
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:56,290
relax now.

4439
01:59:56,291 --> 01:59:56,861
He was good.

4440
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:57,371
He was good though.

4441
01:59:57,371 --> 01:59:58,330
He wanted to save Darya.

4442
01:59:58,480 --> 01:59:59,191
That's a good breakfast.

4443
01:59:59,191 --> 02:00:01,520
So it wasn't Mario
Yamasaki who is a referee?

4444
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:04,360
I don't know that Maya.

4445
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,650
Oh yeah.

4446
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:06,310
Good job.

4447
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:07,720
Awesome job dude.

4448
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,613
Powerful bull.

4449
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:10,391
I don't know,

4450
02:00:10,391 --> 02:00:11,220
but the both of them.

4451
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:11,671
Brazil's there.

4452
02:00:11,671 --> 02:00:12,790
A lot of mines in Brazil.

4453
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:17,350
Probably his brother cause he really
rich Franklin's brother used to do,

4454
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:19,600
we used to referee and
you look at me like,

4455
02:00:19,601 --> 02:00:20,120
hey man,

4456
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:20,953
wait

4457
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:25,060
no you fry man.

4458
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:26,201
Rich Frank.

4459
02:00:26,201 --> 02:00:28,480
Let's think about him the other day
I was watching a replay at him verse

4460
02:00:28,481 --> 02:00:29,950
Anderson and Cincinnati.

4461
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,350
He was such a fun fighter.

4462
02:00:31,351 --> 02:00:33,690
Maybe as a math teacher
look like ace Ventura.

4463
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:34,240
Yeah,

4464
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,280
that's his whole spiel.

4465
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:39,790
You're a big tough motherfucker and one
of the first guys to come in and insane,

4466
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:40,510
insane,

4467
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:41,343
insane,

4468
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:41,710
surreal,

4469
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:42,760
weird workout though.

4470
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,230
I think today it would be,

4471
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:47,380
it would be kind of frowned upon a lot
of the exercises he was doing cause he

4472
02:00:47,381 --> 02:00:51,250
was doing a lot of like
isolation exercises and
really super high repetitions.

4473
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:51,880
You know,

4474
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:53,320
you remember he was doing like machines,

4475
02:00:53,321 --> 02:00:54,400
like the isolation machine.

4476
02:00:54,430 --> 02:00:56,020
That's shit worked though for him.

4477
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:56,351
For him.

4478
02:00:56,351 --> 02:00:58,000
It worked until aunt Sylvia came along.

4479
02:00:58,100 --> 02:00:58,380
Yeah.

4480
02:00:58,380 --> 02:00:59,370
Well cool story bro.

4481
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,213
Check get these knees.

4482
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:01,571
Yeah,

4483
02:01:01,571 --> 02:01:02,171
you're doing what?

4484
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:04,960
Let me go get this plum real
quick and knee or knows.

4485
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:06,523
How about that.

4486
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:07,593
Look at this.

4487
02:01:07,610 --> 02:01:09,870
Look at this card Weidman versus Musashi.

4488
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:11,470
April 8th did you see the poster?

4489
02:01:11,471 --> 02:01:12,730
DC was so pissed.

4490
02:01:12,731 --> 02:01:14,260
I know because what the fucking shit.

4491
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:15,190
Why?

4492
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:16,660
Because rumbles like 80 times.

4493
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:17,590
Very then I'm rumble.

4494
02:01:17,591 --> 02:01:20,440
Looks like King Kong sitting over
and he's the little poor white girl.

4495
02:01:21,780 --> 02:01:23,020
It's very strange

4496
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:29,200
guys con looming in the background.

4497
02:01:29,201 --> 02:01:29,801
Yeah man.

4498
02:01:29,801 --> 02:01:30,010
Like,

4499
02:01:30,010 --> 02:01:31,810
like he beat him before some shit.

4500
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:33,640
Like you didn't get choked
the fuck out in the front.

4501
02:01:33,641 --> 02:01:33,930
No.

4502
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:34,660
Right?

4503
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:35,081
I don't know.

4504
02:01:35,081 --> 02:01:35,950
They look the same size.

4505
02:01:35,951 --> 02:01:36,080
No,

4506
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:36,231
no,

4507
02:01:36,231 --> 02:01:37,064
that's not it.

4508
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:38,000
That's not it.

4509
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:38,500
DC.

4510
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,111
Literally it was like,

4511
02:01:39,111 --> 02:01:40,250
what the fuck is this?

4512
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:42,140
A poster the DC put on Instagram.

4513
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:42,471
Jamie,

4514
02:01:42,471 --> 02:01:43,310
see if you could find this.

4515
02:01:43,311 --> 02:01:43,941
Call them out.

4516
02:01:43,941 --> 02:01:44,990
Like who made this?

4517
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:46,850
I'm the champ for sakes.

4518
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:49,010
Barboza with insane knee.

4519
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:50,000
Holy Shit.

4520
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:50,690
That was good.

4521
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:51,261
That ref.

4522
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:53,540
We need to check him for
fucking so one more time.

4523
02:01:54,230 --> 02:01:54,871
Let's say it here.

4524
02:01:54,871 --> 02:01:55,790
I see some motion.

4525
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:58,490
The fucking job,

4526
02:01:58,491 --> 02:01:59,324
man.

4527
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:00,493
Come on.

4528
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:01,420
Perfect.

4529
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:01,920
Ah,

4530
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:02,571
we're back up.

4531
02:02:02,571 --> 02:02:02,961
He just went,

4532
02:02:02,961 --> 02:02:03,081
oh,

4533
02:02:03,081 --> 02:02:03,321
okay.

4534
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:04,154
Here you go.

4535
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:05,200
Do a little,

4536
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:05,541
for sure.

4537
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:06,374
That's his brother.

4538
02:02:06,770 --> 02:02:09,020
It looks like to me and
they looked very similar.

4539
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:10,740
It looks super similar.

4540
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:11,623
Google it.

4541
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:13,220
You might be racist as fuck though.

4542
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:14,430
There might be a shitload them know.

4543
02:02:14,431 --> 02:02:16,160
It's weird like you can say it's racist,

4544
02:02:16,161 --> 02:02:17,660
but that dude is white as fuck.

4545
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:17,970
Yea.

4546
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:20,060
It's like there it is.

4547
02:02:20,061 --> 02:02:20,750
Look at the dots.

4548
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:22,070
[inaudible] Johnson poster.

4549
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:23,001
Like you can't see it.

4550
02:02:23,001 --> 02:02:23,630
Shit.

4551
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:24,510
Well that's crazy.

4552
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,260
Ridiculous.

4553
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,091
Weird.

4554
02:02:32,091 --> 02:02:32,611
Yeah.

4555
02:02:32,611 --> 02:02:34,730
That's red and shit.

4556
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,380
Whoever did that should get fired.

4557
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:41,630
The Post is ridiculous cause you know
off the Johnson's are knocked out artists

4558
02:02:41,631 --> 02:02:42,440
and he's winning.

4559
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:46,530
But DC your Chapman and he beat him
before Johnson's looming over him.

4560
02:02:46,531 --> 02:02:49,160
I guess they fought before.

4561
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:50,121
What is this?

4562
02:02:50,121 --> 02:02:53,720
Is this the same reason why that Ronda
Rousey video was all Rhonda and very

4563
02:02:53,721 --> 02:02:55,640
little about Amanda Nunez?

4564
02:02:55,641 --> 02:02:56,370
It's difficult.

4565
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:57,650
Neither one of them's a draw.

4566
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:58,790
So does it.

4567
02:02:58,790 --> 02:02:58,971
Oh,

4568
02:02:58,971 --> 02:03:00,590
you don't think people
want to see rumble fight?

4569
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:01,851
I do.

4570
02:03:01,851 --> 02:03:02,200
But if,

4571
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,730
if like just a rumble
fights on a big draw.

4572
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:05,511
I mean you do.

4573
02:03:05,511 --> 02:03:06,260
I love Vermont.

4574
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:06,470
Listen,

4575
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:08,390
I'm not complaining
about robot and rumble.

4576
02:03:08,391 --> 02:03:11,390
Fight for the title is different than
anybody else fighting for the title

4577
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:11,751
rumble.

4578
02:03:11,751 --> 02:03:14,150
Johnson numbers would be on
my side on this argument.

4579
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:14,540
Joe,

4580
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:15,291
not an argument.

4581
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:17,900
I'm just saying like he doesn't
pull in huge numbers paper.

4582
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:19,400
I think you're probably right,

4583
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:22,250
but I think he has the potential to be
a massive star and that's what they're

4584
02:03:22,251 --> 02:03:23,280
seeing with is not the way.

4585
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:23,741
Yeah.

4586
02:03:23,741 --> 02:03:25,020
The way he puts guys to sleep.

4587
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:25,750
Johnson,

4588
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:26,720
I think rumble Johnson.

4589
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:29,960
John Jones House more than rumble Johnson.

4590
02:03:29,961 --> 02:03:30,794
Daniel Cormay.

4591
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:32,700
Well they fought and beat them.

4592
02:03:32,730 --> 02:03:33,090
Yeah,

4593
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:33,830
I think you're right.

4594
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:35,510
What could his timing on his fucking knee,

4595
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:36,290
but dude,

4596
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,420
Uhm,

4597
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:39,170
oh my God.

4598
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:43,040
I mean that's about as perfect and
knee is anybody's ever thrown in life.

4599
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:45,170
That's a perfect timing.

4600
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:48,740
He wasn't winning that fight
before that crazy lot of my card.

4601
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:49,131
Oh,

4602
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:50,240
well I didn't have a card.

4603
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:50,901
Do you have a card?

4604
02:03:50,901 --> 02:03:51,021
Yeah,

4605
02:03:51,021 --> 02:03:51,501
I'm right here.

4606
02:03:51,501 --> 02:03:52,334
Here we go.

4607
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:54,450
And that ref MVP.

4608
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,380
Damn Edson Barboza was a beast.

4609
02:03:57,950 --> 02:03:58,581
Number five.

4610
02:03:58,581 --> 02:03:59,930
Just be Dariusz knocked him out.

4611
02:03:59,970 --> 02:04:01,280
He was a fun one coming up.

4612
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,660
What a crazy division.

4613
02:04:02,661 --> 02:04:05,130
That one 55 is boiling murder,

4614
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,190
Bro.

4615
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:07,700
That shit together.

4616
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:08,241
Oh yeah.

4617
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:11,240
You have to be able to do everything
because even this guy gets out of work by

4618
02:04:11,241 --> 02:04:11,690
people.

4619
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:12,021
Yeah,

4620
02:04:12,021 --> 02:04:12,680
man.

4621
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:16,190
He's lost some big hello pedis pedis now
has to come back to this shit and joy.

4622
02:04:16,191 --> 02:04:16,850
That is,

4623
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:17,683
yeah,

4624
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,340
but 55 for him,

4625
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:23,570
but he didn't really have that bad
of a run at 55 plus couple decisions.

4626
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:24,111
Oh listen,

4627
02:04:24,111 --> 02:04:27,620
when he was on top of 55 when he knocked
out cowboy Cerrone with that body kick

4628
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:28,581
knocked out,

4629
02:04:28,581 --> 02:04:33,581
Joe Lozan tapped out and Benson
Henderson to win the title.

4630
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:34,930
He can still do work.

4631
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:35,420
He's still,

4632
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:36,253
he's a beast.

4633
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,880
He's a beast of an athlete
and he's still fairly young.

4634
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:40,380
I feel like with a guy like that,

4635
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,670
like the,

4636
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:46,700
it's almost like he has to take some time
and get his body to the perfect weight

4637
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:50,070
and strength to compete at one 55 thing.

4638
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:50,251
Joe,

4639
02:04:50,251 --> 02:04:50,671
where's he at?

4640
02:04:50,671 --> 02:04:52,770
Mentally like he's been
to the top of Everest.

4641
02:04:52,771 --> 02:04:53,390
He stayed.

4642
02:04:53,390 --> 02:04:54,570
He's put the flag in there.

4643
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:56,100
You know what it takes to get there.

4644
02:04:56,101 --> 02:04:57,270
Do you still want to do that?

4645
02:04:57,380 --> 02:04:58,650
Like you've been through all this,

4646
02:04:58,651 --> 02:05:01,770
do you really want to restart from the
bottom and go up and you can tell what

4647
02:05:01,771 --> 02:05:02,461
it's like up there?

4648
02:05:02,461 --> 02:05:03,294
Is it any different?

4649
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,440
Yeah.

4650
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,000
And you're dealing with all the issues,

4651
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:07,530
physical issues.

4652
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:11,040
This DC rumble fucking promo.

4653
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:11,961
Tom,

4654
02:05:11,961 --> 02:05:12,231
Tom,

4655
02:05:12,231 --> 02:05:12,770
Tom,

4656
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:14,310
um,

4657
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:16,940
something that's going to be a fun fight.

4658
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:19,530
I like Weidman Musashi on that too.

4659
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:20,391
Yeah,

4660
02:05:20,391 --> 02:05:21,270
that's a very fun,

4661
02:05:21,271 --> 02:05:21,570
fine.

4662
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:22,021
I liked that.

4663
02:05:22,021 --> 02:05:22,640
Find a lot.

4664
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:24,570
The Dallas card is,

4665
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:27,540
everybody's on it.

4666
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:30,090
Katrina's real good on that one.

4667
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:30,993
Yeah.

4668
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:33,150
I don't even know where to start.

4669
02:05:33,450 --> 02:05:34,283
I mean,

4670
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:35,180
can you bring that up?

4671
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:35,911
We'll just look at it.

4672
02:05:35,911 --> 02:05:36,930
There's so many Eddie.

4673
02:05:36,931 --> 02:05:37,764
My mind's gone.

4674
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:38,761
Well,

4675
02:05:38,761 --> 02:05:39,600
it's a heavyweight title,

4676
02:05:39,601 --> 02:05:39,841
right?

4677
02:05:39,841 --> 02:05:41,290
It's junior dos Santos versus Steve.

4678
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:42,660
John,

4679
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:42,930
uh,

4680
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:43,591
John Jay.

4681
02:05:43,591 --> 02:05:47,320
Check on that bitch and
now she's fighting here.

4682
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:47,611
Go,

4683
02:05:47,611 --> 02:05:48,444
go high on that.

4684
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:49,740
She's fighting Jessica.

4685
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:50,743
Raj.

4686
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:51,480
Um,

4687
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:52,313
yeah man.

4688
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,071
Oh,

4689
02:05:53,071 --> 02:05:54,240
Eddie Alvarez pour.

4690
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:54,840
Yay.

4691
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:55,470
Yeah.

4692
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:55,711
Oh,

4693
02:05:55,711 --> 02:05:56,544
what does this

4694
02:05:57,770 --> 02:06:00,100
Marzola ain't doing shit when he moved in.

4695
02:06:00,101 --> 02:06:01,380
He tez and Riki.

4696
02:06:01,381 --> 02:06:03,630
Barsol that's interesting
that that's on the main card.

4697
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:04,860
I don't think that that does that.

4698
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,440
It's not set yet.

4699
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:08,430
They're just toss them up there.

4700
02:06:08,431 --> 02:06:09,270
Cause the Frankie Edgar,

4701
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:11,500
now you're Rodriguez is a burn.

4702
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:12,630
Oh my goodness.

4703
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,030
I think it's too much right here.

4704
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:19,130
But getting insurance for for a year
this soon does he just murdered and then

4705
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:19,921
Henry.

4706
02:06:19,921 --> 02:06:21,450
So Hudl versus Sergio Pettis.

4707
02:06:21,451 --> 02:06:22,284
Holy Shit.

4708
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:22,770
I know.

4709
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:25,290
Damn Sergio Pettis got some
serious abs back up real quick.

4710
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:28,590
But what in the fuck so
called the golden snitch.

4711
02:06:28,710 --> 02:06:29,640
Jesus Christ.

4712
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:32,410
He's not passing the sniff test.

4713
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:33,680
The golden snitch us.

4714
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:35,350
You Ain't pass inside of your shredded.

4715
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:36,091
Wow.

4716
02:06:36,091 --> 02:06:37,170
What a fucking card.

4717
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:38,090
Look at that car.

4718
02:06:38,091 --> 02:06:39,740
Pettis has quietly becoming,

4719
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:40,111
you know,

4720
02:06:40,111 --> 02:06:41,700
a real bad ass and the division,

4721
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:45,570
the real fight in the car that I'm
interested in the most honestly is Frankie

4722
02:06:45,570 --> 02:06:46,770
Edgar versus Yahya Rodriguez.

4723
02:06:46,771 --> 02:06:49,230
I'm looking forward to that
as much as Damien Maia math.

4724
02:06:49,231 --> 02:06:50,470
But the hall is much thinner.

4725
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:51,630
That's going sizzler.

4726
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:51,931
Yeah,

4727
02:06:51,931 --> 02:06:52,710
but dude,

4728
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:56,640
Yani Rodriguez is doing some crazy
street fighter shit in there.

4729
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:57,780
I want to sin.

4730
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:01,170
I want to see what he could do to Frankie
if he can land a three 60 roundhouse

4731
02:07:01,171 --> 02:07:02,070
kick on Frankie Edgar.

4732
02:07:02,071 --> 02:07:02,730
We've got a party.

4733
02:07:02,730 --> 02:07:03,990
I don't like that fight son.

4734
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:06,630
The parties with a steep a dos Santos.

4735
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:07,560
That's the party too,

4736
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:08,400
right?

4737
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,233
Did that.

4738
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:11,370
And it was a close fight.

4739
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:12,000
Mad,

4740
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,640
sad face May 13th it's a while.

4741
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:15,961
Yeah.

4742
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:17,280
When you get punched to changes.

4743
02:07:17,310 --> 02:07:17,820
Yeah.

4744
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:18,230
When?

4745
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:21,060
When Cain Velasquez fucking 10
rises your faith for tenants,

4746
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:22,590
he looks more and more evil.

4747
02:07:22,591 --> 02:07:23,760
He looks like he's the guy,

4748
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:26,320
couldn't be the nice and
couldn't get any nicer night day.

4749
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:29,250
That'd be the most
friendliest guy in the world.

4750
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:31,020
Steve is a good dude too,

4751
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:32,490
but that's a great fucking fight

4752
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:35,563
they're to do.

4753
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:38,290
They're trying to do Eddie Alvarez
versus Ferguson first one like,

4754
02:07:38,291 --> 02:07:38,681
Nah man,

4755
02:07:38,681 --> 02:07:42,760
I'm waiting for this title shot
on Eddie to look at Shogun.

4756
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:44,470
The network looks kind of strange.

4757
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:45,200
No,

4758
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:47,570
it looks real slow doing
it for the cameras fellas.

4759
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:48,461
They're warming up,

4760
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:48,850
you know.

4761
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:49,683
But they come in,

4762
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:51,010
they might already warmed up and they,

4763
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,910
when they come in they go,

4764
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,300
hey,

4765
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:54,010
we're going to get you
now on film and just,

4766
02:07:54,070 --> 02:07:54,721
you're almost called,

4767
02:07:54,721 --> 02:07:55,630
you stand up and you're not,

4768
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:56,560
this isn't real.

4769
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:58,240
That guy to the ride has been

4770
02:08:00,610 --> 02:08:01,840
plus you don't want to show it too much.

4771
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:02,890
That's a crazy fight though.

4772
02:08:02,891 --> 02:08:05,200
Shogun has been in so many wars.

4773
02:08:05,450 --> 02:08:05,940
Oh,

4774
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:06,431
you always like,

4775
02:08:06,431 --> 02:08:08,230
how many more warrants can that guy be in?

4776
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:09,830
Wait,

4777
02:08:09,830 --> 02:08:10,663
what's this

4778
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:15,220
kicking ass again,

4779
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:15,841
dude,

4780
02:08:15,841 --> 02:08:17,770
she's babied us constantly kicking ass.

4781
02:08:17,771 --> 02:08:18,880
She's super body though.

4782
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:20,081
Yup.

4783
02:08:20,081 --> 02:08:21,100
She got them robot tits.

4784
02:08:21,101 --> 02:08:21,551
Hey guys,

4785
02:08:21,551 --> 02:08:21,911
seriously.

4786
02:08:21,911 --> 02:08:22,720
It's bad.

4787
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:23,560
Don't be misogynist.

4788
02:08:23,890 --> 02:08:24,723
It's women's mom.

4789
02:08:25,950 --> 02:08:26,750
I have to check.

4790
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:27,760
What is the misogyny?

4791
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:29,320
Does that mean like you hate women?

4792
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:31,770
She say she has a nice,

4793
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:33,230
it does not mean your massage.

4794
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:33,840
No,

4795
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,140
she went,

4796
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:34,631
Oh man,

4797
02:08:34,631 --> 02:08:35,464
you have some nice,

4798
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:36,710
but if you say she,

4799
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:37,471
yeah.

4800
02:08:37,471 --> 02:08:37,811
If she,

4801
02:08:37,811 --> 02:08:39,530
you say she's got some nice to ties.

4802
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:40,510
That's being real.

4803
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:42,520
Is that kind of problem
with the way the flashiness,

4804
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:44,530
the way the left brands,

4805
02:08:44,531 --> 02:08:47,470
any kind of like the
narrative of feminism,

4806
02:08:47,471 --> 02:08:49,480
like a femme women are victims.

4807
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:54,430
Men are oppressors and toxic and predators
and you can't have a discussion from

4808
02:08:54,431 --> 02:08:54,850
that.

4809
02:08:54,850 --> 02:08:57,760
It's like just cause I think a woman's
beautiful and I compliment her or she

4810
02:08:57,761 --> 02:08:58,810
turns me on.

4811
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:00,820
It doesn't mean I want to oppress her.

4812
02:09:00,821 --> 02:09:02,290
It just means they want
to have sex with her.

4813
02:09:02,291 --> 02:09:04,000
I feel like we turned the corner on that.

4814
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:06,480
I feel like we're turning
the corner on the team yet.

4815
02:09:06,481 --> 02:09:07,060
We haven't.

4816
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:07,331
Yeah.

4817
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:09,400
But I think that they're
being critiqued on a,

4818
02:09:09,401 --> 02:09:11,710
on a level that they've never
really been critiqued it.

4819
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,360
Good,

4820
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:12,670
good.

4821
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:13,540
I'm glad to hear that.

4822
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:13,901
Don't mean,

4823
02:09:13,901 --> 02:09:14,470
don't you think,

4824
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:16,720
I mean with the kind of scrutiny
that they receive online?

4825
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:17,950
I do.

4826
02:09:17,951 --> 02:09:20,710
The problem is I think most of us
are living in our own echo chambers.

4827
02:09:20,711 --> 02:09:24,550
I think the biggest problem with online
online stuff is that most of us are able

4828
02:09:24,551 --> 02:09:25,870
to create our own echo chambers.

4829
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:27,490
And so there isn't enough,

4830
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:27,971
uh,

4831
02:09:27,971 --> 02:09:32,920
exchange of ideas and I think we all
need to kind of open up and I think you

4832
02:09:32,921 --> 02:09:37,030
should listen to the people you disagree
with as much as you possibly can to see

4833
02:09:37,031 --> 02:09:40,450
what you don't like about them
and what they're really saying.

4834
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:42,070
If you rely on just the media,

4835
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:43,680
what they're gonna do is they're going to,

4836
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:47,530
they're going to highlight four
sentences that you said over and over.

4837
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:51,040
And what the biggest problem we have is
that you can say one sentence and people

4838
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:55,240
brand this very complex human being
who is always changing day to day and

4839
02:09:55,241 --> 02:09:56,560
they'll brand you with the label.

4840
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:57,580
You're a sexist,

4841
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,443
you're a racist,

4842
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:59,080
you're Amazon.

4843
02:09:59,080 --> 02:09:59,291
Well,

4844
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:00,400
human beings are very different.

4845
02:10:00,401 --> 02:10:00,641
I'm,

4846
02:10:00,641 --> 02:10:01,690
I'm very different day to day.

4847
02:10:01,691 --> 02:10:02,620
Some depending on my mood,

4848
02:10:02,621 --> 02:10:03,700
I say some fucked up shit.

4849
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:06,280
Then I say some really nice things
and depending on how I feel,

4850
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:11,470
but I know who I am defining
people through a few tweets
or a blog or article or

4851
02:10:11,471 --> 02:10:12,304
something like that.

4852
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:14,380
You're talking about
a human's entire life.

4853
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,221
It's ridiculous.

4854
02:10:15,221 --> 02:10:16,600
It doesn't move ideas forward.

4855
02:10:16,990 --> 02:10:19,720
What's also the reality of censorship?

4856
02:10:20,110 --> 02:10:20,591
I mean you're,

4857
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:25,120
you're attempting to instead of debate
people and their ideas and offer superior

4858
02:10:25,121 --> 02:10:25,954
ideas yeah.

4859
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:28,060
And put your ideas to the
test instead of doing that,

4860
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:29,680
they want to silence speech.

4861
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:30,550
So they want us,

4862
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:32,620
they want to stop people
like Jordan Peterson.

4863
02:10:32,650 --> 02:10:33,000
There's,

4864
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:33,740
uh,

4865
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:37,560
a university just called them transphobic
and to try to get him kicked off of a

4866
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:39,450
thing and go get it was I think they are,

4867
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:40,393
I think it was in,

4868
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:41,840
I want to say it was in Dublin.

4869
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:44,360
Charles Murray will
speak at the university.

4870
02:10:44,650 --> 02:10:47,030
Well a lot of people have not
been allowed to speak recently.

4871
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:48,460
And in these leftists universities,

4872
02:10:48,461 --> 02:10:51,440
they won't even let you speak because
you have a different idea because you

4873
02:10:51,441 --> 02:10:54,440
might have an idea that grates
against the common orthodoxy.

4874
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:56,450
And Jordan Peterson by the way,

4875
02:10:56,451 --> 02:10:58,510
is anything but transphobic.

4876
02:10:58,520 --> 02:10:59,630
He's absolutely not.

4877
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:02,210
And the only thing that he said is he
doesn't want to use a bunch of made up

4878
02:11:02,211 --> 02:11:04,810
gender stereotypes or gender pronouns,

4879
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:05,210
brother.

4880
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:08,630
Or how about the fact that I have
to give you verbal consent and bets.

4881
02:11:08,631 --> 02:11:10,790
You're getting into my bedroom
telling me how to speak.

4882
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:11,480
It did,

4883
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:12,140
this is,

4884
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:12,621
this is,

4885
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:13,454
um,

4886
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:16,100
I don't think we've seen anything
like this and that's the problem.

4887
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:16,271
And you,

4888
02:11:16,271 --> 02:11:19,700
it has to be fought against it just
because it's a form of tyranny.

4889
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:20,721
And by the way,

4890
02:11:20,721 --> 02:11:21,380
again,

4891
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:21,701
the,

4892
02:11:21,701 --> 02:11:22,220
the,

4893
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:22,820
the,

4894
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:26,600
the reason a lot of the liberal press has
lost their credibility is because they

4895
02:11:26,601 --> 02:11:29,660
harp on they'll brand like
think about even with Trump,

4896
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:30,494
well I'm not a fan,

4897
02:11:30,530 --> 02:11:31,363
a fan of,

4898
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:35,340
they brand him all of these
things where it's kind of the how,

4899
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:37,080
what are we supposed to do
with that kind of when you,

4900
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:41,360
when you call somebody that is it over
now or we just done with that person or

4901
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:41,721
is there a,

4902
02:11:41,721 --> 02:11:43,880
is there a smarter way
to break somebody down?

4903
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:45,450
Yeah.

4904
02:11:45,710 --> 02:11:46,490
I don't know man.

4905
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:46,800
It's,

4906
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,230
it's especially at the left.

4907
02:11:48,231 --> 02:11:49,880
I love how the left tries to,

4908
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:50,361
you know,

4909
02:11:50,361 --> 02:11:51,270
speaking of like if you,

4910
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:52,340
if you dislike Trump,

4911
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:54,920
the way I would fight
Trump is I would do this.

4912
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:55,550
I would go,

4913
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:56,420
he's not a Democrat,

4914
02:11:56,810 --> 02:11:58,400
he's not a Republican.

4915
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:00,890
He's not even an American.

4916
02:12:00,891 --> 02:12:01,724
He's a Trumpist.

4917
02:12:01,730 --> 02:12:02,660
He's a monarch.

4918
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:04,730
That's how you get the second
amendment guys on your side.

4919
02:12:04,731 --> 02:12:07,860
If you're a liberal and you want to
get the other people on your side,

4920
02:12:08,030 --> 02:12:08,900
it doesn't work that way.

4921
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:10,320
You can a second amendment guys,

4922
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:11,210
if he supports them,

4923
02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:12,990
frame the left doesn't,

4924
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:15,170
the left doesn't support
second amendment rights.

4925
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:16,700
So if he does,

4926
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:17,563
he gets them.

4927
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:18,770
It's really that simple.

4928
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:21,350
Or you frame the debate a different way.

4929
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:21,831
Right?

4930
02:12:21,831 --> 02:12:24,170
So so your be more fair about,

4931
02:12:24,171 --> 02:12:27,800
be more specific and detailed
on how you criticize somebody.

4932
02:12:27,801 --> 02:12:28,250
Forget Trump.

4933
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:31,910
Anybody know what you don't
like about that person?

4934
02:12:32,150 --> 02:12:34,340
Because there's a lot to
like about a lot of people,

4935
02:12:34,341 --> 02:12:35,330
even if they're assholes.

4936
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:36,080
I think,

4937
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:38,300
I mean the people are complicated,

4938
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:39,171
right?

4939
02:12:39,171 --> 02:12:40,220
We all have friends and they,

4940
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:43,820
all of us have friends that we love and
they have aspects of their personality.

4941
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:45,140
We don't necessarily like day to day,

4942
02:12:45,141 --> 02:12:45,620
right?

4943
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:47,300
Some nights they're
idiots in certain ways,

4944
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:50,720
but we forgive him because we know
that in talking about yourself now I'm

4945
02:12:50,721 --> 02:12:51,650
talking about taking me out,

4946
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:55,070
talking to people who
feel like he's given us.

4947
02:12:55,071 --> 02:12:57,440
We need a moment of silence
which showed that a locked up.

4948
02:12:57,500 --> 02:12:58,760
It might be the last time we see him,

4949
02:12:58,761 --> 02:12:59,210
right?

4950
02:12:59,210 --> 02:12:59,511
Yeah,

4951
02:12:59,511 --> 02:13:00,080
man,

4952
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:00,913
you never know.

4953
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:03,560
I mean how many more
years can that guy go out?

4954
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:05,990
Mount Rushmore and he's
a bad motherfucker.

4955
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:06,420
Yeah.

4956
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:07,730
About 40 guys on my mouth.

4957
02:13:07,770 --> 02:13:07,941
Yeah,

4958
02:13:07,941 --> 02:13:10,400
you must mount Rushmore
has to be big as fuck.

4959
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:11,570
Cause don't give me four or five.

4960
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,141
Well first of all,

4961
02:13:12,141 --> 02:13:12,940
you have to have hoists.

4962
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:15,620
Gracie Gracie's on Mount Rushmore period.

4963
02:13:15,710 --> 02:13:16,490
Right.

4964
02:13:16,490 --> 02:13:19,790
He was the original guy that set it
all off whether or not let me still get

4965
02:13:19,791 --> 02:13:20,690
bullied numbers with that.

4966
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,381
Ken shamrock.

4967
02:13:21,381 --> 02:13:22,214
Crazy,

4968
02:13:22,270 --> 02:13:22,940
crazy numbers.

4969
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:23,460
Huge numbers.

4970
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:24,800
Millions plus.

4971
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:26,323
He's got to be on it.

4972
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:30,260
But that's kind of like the way babe
Ruth would be on Mount Rushmore for cause

4973
02:13:30,261 --> 02:13:31,160
he's one of the first.

4974
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,260
So yes.

4975
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:35,080
Makes it even started at pioneers.

4976
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:35,461
Yeah.

4977
02:13:35,461 --> 02:13:38,070
But Babe Ruth and hoists
Gracie that they did work,

4978
02:13:38,270 --> 02:13:40,380
they just didn't start it
like they did fucking work.

4979
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:41,220
Right?

4980
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:43,090
Like Babe Ruth's numbers are legitimate.

4981
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:44,340
She always,

4982
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:46,140
Gracie did something spectacular.

4983
02:13:46,141 --> 02:13:49,230
You introduced the idea that a smaller
man could be a bigger man in a real life

4984
02:13:49,231 --> 02:13:51,580
fight and with techniques
that you've never seen before.

4985
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:52,740
[inaudible] 16 man tournament.

4986
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:53,250
Yeah.

4987
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:53,760
Yes.

4988
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,211
You never see,

4989
02:13:54,211 --> 02:13:56,070
nobody saw triangles before.

4990
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:56,940
Hoists.

4991
02:13:56,940 --> 02:13:57,870
Gracie tapped out.

4992
02:13:57,871 --> 02:13:58,471
Dan Severen.

4993
02:13:58,471 --> 02:14:02,310
No one even knew what the fuck he was
doing and then when when you try to bring

4994
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:06,450
it back to go like in 1993 try
going to your local Jujitsu school,

4995
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:07,590
tell him to teach you that.

4996
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:07,900
Oh,

4997
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:08,733
that's advanced.

4998
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:11,310
They were not teaching people triangles
because they thought that shit was

4999
02:14:11,311 --> 02:14:12,144
advanced.

5000
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:14,003
I know a dude,

5001
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:17,970
I know it it to went through a certain
Jujitsu school right afterwards and they

5002
02:14:17,971 --> 02:14:18,804
told him,

5003
02:14:18,870 --> 02:14:20,610
we can't teach you triangles yet.

5004
02:14:20,611 --> 02:14:21,960
You're not ready for that yet.

5005
02:14:21,961 --> 02:14:23,220
That's advanced techniques.

5006
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:27,390
They were holding shit back from people
fade or is on that Mount Rushmore for

5007
02:14:27,391 --> 02:14:27,810
sure.

5008
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:30,630
100% faders on there
and then current guys,

5009
02:14:30,631 --> 02:14:31,590
I'd say cane.

5010
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:33,470
How many guys can you have on rush?

5011
02:14:33,471 --> 02:14:34,380
My artist too many.

5012
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:34,771
There's two.

5013
02:14:34,771 --> 02:14:35,700
Mount Rushmore is,

5014
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,860
it's got to be another thing for,

5015
02:14:38,910 --> 02:14:41,490
you can't have four fours and salvage GSP.

5016
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:42,870
We know that.

5017
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:43,380
Right.

5018
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:46,890
How did they decide who was
going to itself and she has
to pay 100% how did they

5019
02:14:46,891 --> 02:14:47,724
decide?

5020
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:49,113
It's a good question.

5021
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:50,400
Do you know what he,

5022
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:51,233
I have no idea.

5023
02:14:52,230 --> 02:14:54,240
Who are the guys that have stayed
at the top for a long time.

5024
02:14:54,570 --> 02:14:55,350
Anderson Silva,

5025
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:57,090
GSP and finished dudes.

5026
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:57,481
Well yeah,

5027
02:14:57,481 --> 02:14:59,000
but then what about Matt Hughes?

5028
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:02,820
Hughes finished GSP in a title fight.

5029
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:05,340
How long was it Matt who
is on top of a while?

5030
02:15:05,850 --> 02:15:06,630
Quite a while.

5031
02:15:06,630 --> 02:15:07,351
Most women gay.

5032
02:15:07,351 --> 02:15:10,350
So that's another real pioneer that change
the game and a lot of ways because he

5033
02:15:10,351 --> 02:15:13,380
introduced the idea that high
level wrestling plus submissions,

5034
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,230
like when he hit that
far side arm bar on GSP,

5035
02:15:16,231 --> 02:15:19,140
GSP went for a Kimora and
he didn't secure the legs.

5036
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:19,651
And Matt,

5037
02:15:19,651 --> 02:15:22,110
he was spun around that far
side arm bar and locked it in.

5038
02:15:22,111 --> 02:15:22,944
It was beautiful.

5039
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,270
And then what about Uriah Faber?

5040
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:27,920
What he did for the little guy
and then Wa favor you've got,

5041
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:28,570
but no,

5042
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:29,071
but hold on.

5043
02:15:29,071 --> 02:15:29,760
You're right.

5044
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,220
The problem with Uriah Faber
as he never wanted UFC title,

5045
02:15:32,221 --> 02:15:35,750
and I think if you're talking about
a UFC hall fame in his prime grade,

5046
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:36,720
he wanted a WC.

5047
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:37,590
How am I Bj Penn?

5048
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:38,483
He did.

5049
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:39,640
Bj Penn's gotta be in there,

5050
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:40,790
he's got the care before.

5051
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:42,970
It can't be full of 150 full.

5052
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:48,180
I don't know how to choose after you got
to choose stresses me that can't I get

5053
02:15:48,181 --> 02:15:48,541
stressed.

5054
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:48,790
Hold on,

5055
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:49,620
hold on,

5056
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:49,951
hold on.

5057
02:15:49,951 --> 02:15:50,521
I don't want to do it.

5058
02:15:50,521 --> 02:15:50,761
This guy,

5059
02:15:50,761 --> 02:15:51,660
is there a heavy weight in there?

5060
02:15:51,661 --> 02:15:52,590
What heavyweight to choose?

5061
02:15:52,591 --> 02:15:55,770
It'd be probably fade or
Taylor or retainer and
there's argument for for doom.

5062
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:56,311
No,

5063
02:15:56,311 --> 02:15:56,641
not for,

5064
02:15:56,641 --> 02:15:57,474
not for dinner.

5065
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:58,860
How dare you know?

5066
02:15:58,861 --> 02:15:59,730
Care might be up there,

5067
02:15:59,731 --> 02:16:01,410
but I don't care.

5068
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:02,263
It might be up there.

5069
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:05,970
I think federal right over
dominance for a long period of time.

5070
02:16:05,971 --> 02:16:07,980
What about Dominick
Cruz knocking dude out.

5071
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:08,720
Amazing.

5072
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:09,120
Yeah.

5073
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:10,050
He only lost twice.

5074
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:11,970
Once by choke and once by decision.

5075
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:17,130
You know the last place chosen long
ass time ago at one 45 John Jones.

5076
02:16:17,131 --> 02:16:17,671
You know what I'm saying?

5077
02:16:17,671 --> 02:16:19,080
Like you can't ever lost,

5078
02:16:19,110 --> 02:16:20,700
he came up with John's never lost.

5079
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:23,550
I think you've going to
dude's ass and got this call.

5080
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:26,460
Anderson Silva.

5081
02:16:27,870 --> 02:16:28,710
Conor McGregor.

5082
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:30,220
Yeah,

5083
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:30,670
you do.

5084
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:31,830
You don't like talking about pine,

5085
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:32,690
like game changers.

5086
02:16:33,510 --> 02:16:34,600
You have to look at a couple of things.

5087
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:35,563
Longevity,

5088
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:36,760
like how long were they on top?

5089
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:37,601
That's got to take a place.

5090
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:37,900
Right.

5091
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:39,220
Let's talk about criteria for it.

5092
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:40,600
How long have you been on top?

5093
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:41,670
Uh,

5094
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:42,460
how did you,

5095
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:43,710
did you finish dudes?

5096
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:45,190
That's kind of how many finishes that,

5097
02:16:45,191 --> 02:16:46,390
that's got to play a factor.

5098
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:46,940
What do you mean?

5099
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:48,310
So how long you been in the top?

5100
02:16:48,311 --> 02:16:48,960
So how,

5101
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:49,390
you know,

5102
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:50,171
how long were you champ?

5103
02:16:50,171 --> 02:16:52,000
How long did you hold the belt?

5104
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:52,810
That's,

5105
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:53,920
that's got to play a factor.

5106
02:16:53,970 --> 02:16:54,111
Yeah,

5107
02:16:54,111 --> 02:16:54,620
that's a big fat.

5108
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:55,120
How long,

5109
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:56,170
how did you do it?

5110
02:16:56,171 --> 02:16:57,010
Did you finish?

5111
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:00,460
How many people did you actually
finish your competition too?

5112
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:03,730
Sometimes guys get dominant and
they're in a slump in the division.

5113
02:17:03,731 --> 02:17:06,550
Like when Mike Tyson came along
and was Merck and everybody,

5114
02:17:06,551 --> 02:17:06,851
and there was,

5115
02:17:06,851 --> 02:17:07,870
you know Tony tubs?

5116
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:07,991
Yeah.

5117
02:17:07,991 --> 02:17:08,321
He's like,

5118
02:17:08,321 --> 02:17:13,321
he's fighting Bruce Selden on my
mount Rushmore for that reason.

5119
02:17:13,451 --> 02:17:18,160
He's on my mount Rushmore to GSP fought
everybody and stayed on top forever.

5120
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:21,040
Everybody Hoists Bj,

5121
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:22,210
Jon Jones.

5122
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:23,110
Anderson Silva,

5123
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:24,153
GSP.

5124
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:24,993
What about

5125
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:28,570
what about mighty mouse
and fade or not John?

5126
02:17:28,571 --> 02:17:29,404
John's.

5127
02:17:30,010 --> 02:17:30,520
Well,

5128
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:34,170
see Jon Jones has never lost though
and he's beating all those other guys.

5129
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:36,670
It was the youngest champ.

5130
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:38,500
How long was he up on top for two years.

5131
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:39,541
No long though.

5132
02:17:39,541 --> 02:17:40,510
It's been on longer than that.

5133
02:17:40,511 --> 02:17:41,700
You know he beat,

5134
02:17:42,580 --> 02:17:45,100
he beat Shogun when he was 23 man,

5135
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:46,790
so it's never lost weight.

5136
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:48,760
He's 30 now.

5137
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,320
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

5138
02:17:50,321 --> 02:17:51,011
Seven years.

5139
02:17:51,011 --> 02:17:52,120
B.

5140
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:53,230
He wasn't on top of seven years.

5141
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:53,831
Oh wait a minute.

5142
02:17:53,831 --> 02:17:54,380
He's on top of,

5143
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:54,761
I'm sorry.

5144
02:17:54,761 --> 02:17:55,270
Excuse me.

5145
02:17:55,270 --> 02:17:56,230
How about Josie Aldo?

5146
02:17:56,231 --> 02:17:57,430
He's ahead of John Jones.

5147
02:17:57,431 --> 02:17:57,900
His knee.

5148
02:17:57,900 --> 02:17:58,071
Yeah,

5149
02:17:58,071 --> 02:17:59,670
but he got knocked out by Conor Mcgregor.

5150
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:01,690
He lost after nine years.

5151
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:01,961
Yeah,

5152
02:18:01,961 --> 02:18:03,160
but there's a reality.

5153
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:06,280
You've got to look at
someone based on the overall,

5154
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:08,500
the overall performance of their career.

5155
02:18:08,530 --> 02:18:09,300
He held the belt.

5156
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:09,521
No,

5157
02:18:09,521 --> 02:18:10,480
you lost phenomenal.

5158
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:11,920
The big fight,

5159
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:15,520
the big fight that he had
against his biggest fan of that,

5160
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:18,473
Jon Jones.

5161
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:20,140
Huge.

5162
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:21,130
You have to count all that.

5163
02:18:21,131 --> 02:18:21,821
He doesn't matter.

5164
02:18:21,821 --> 02:18:22,610
He's went through Hawaii,

5165
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:23,560
so he went through,

5166
02:18:23,561 --> 02:18:24,700
I'm like a hot knife through butter.

5167
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:25,863
That was the old,

5168
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:27,400
that was fine.

5169
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,293
Dad bought,

5170
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:29,433
this is what it is.

5171
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:32,970
People fade or Coleman.

5172
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:34,960
That's the Mark Coleman.

5173
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:38,290
He changed a lot of shit to UFC.

5174
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:40,180
He's the one who brought
wrestlers the problem.

5175
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:42,980
I know one of you have a seatbelt
and a pride by knows route.

5176
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:44,710
We're stand Henderson on that bitch.

5177
02:18:44,711 --> 02:18:45,670
That's a good question.

5178
02:18:46,770 --> 02:18:50,320
Engevity but time division
champion itch simultaneously.

5179
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:53,680
Never Strike Force to championship.

5180
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:55,300
Fuck everyone.

5181
02:18:55,330 --> 02:18:55,840
Amazing.

5182
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:56,470
Awesome.

5183
02:18:56,470 --> 02:18:59,380
You could argue that he might've
won that decision against Bisping.

5184
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:00,670
He was anywhere other than England.

5185
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:01,960
A lot of people have argued that.

5186
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:02,740
I understand,

5187
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:04,690
but I'm talking about
people that held the belt.

5188
02:19:04,691 --> 02:19:04,991
You got,

5189
02:19:04,991 --> 02:19:08,350
you have to use bell holders for
love with Dan was fighting in pride,

5190
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:10,650
but Dan was fighting for
the belt against business.

5191
02:19:10,651 --> 02:19:11,110
Stan,

5192
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:13,270
if he beats Bisbing and
wins the middleweight title,

5193
02:19:13,271 --> 02:19:17,110
you've got to look at him as
like con top five of all time.

5194
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:18,351
He's still taught,

5195
02:19:18,351 --> 02:19:20,020
but there's still as far
as far as this trial,

5196
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:20,950
not top five,

5197
02:19:20,951 --> 02:19:22,180
but who knows what the number is.

5198
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:22,830
There's too many.

5199
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:23,590
There's too many.

5200
02:19:23,590 --> 02:19:23,771
Oh,

5201
02:19:23,771 --> 02:19:26,410
these guys are throwing hard right away.

5202
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:28,050
Put

5203
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:29,360
it right in front of this kid.

5204
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:30,990
The three most dominant winters.

5205
02:19:32,130 --> 02:19:32,901
Tough dude too,

5206
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:33,111
man.

5207
02:19:33,111 --> 02:19:35,330
It needs a big fucking guy.

5208
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:36,950
Football player or a football player.

5209
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:38,540
Big Tool five or man,

5210
02:19:38,630 --> 02:19:40,100
big strong motherfucker.

5211
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:42,111
This is,

5212
02:19:42,111 --> 02:19:42,944
he played football.

5213
02:19:43,410 --> 02:19:44,330
He played just college.

5214
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:45,261
College,

5215
02:19:45,261 --> 02:19:46,094
Hofstra.

5216
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:48,110
Oh Jesus.

5217
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:49,450
God.

5218
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,320
She'll get until he's had a granite chin.

5219
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:54,080
Oh Shit.

5220
02:19:54,210 --> 02:19:55,640
Them son tagged him.

5221
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:56,570
Power.

5222
02:19:56,570 --> 02:19:57,650
Goodness by Shogun.

5223
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:00,660
This is a crazy fly holding,

5224
02:20:00,670 --> 02:20:01,670
which is the body

5225
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:05,330
that's that veteran approach for sure.

5226
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:06,193
Power one.

5227
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:07,250
How old is ruined now?

5228
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:11,050
Shoguns got some weird thing going on
this right all and that isn't it right

5229
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:11,933
peck,

5230
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:13,830
he sprout 30 32 at the moment.

5231
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:15,730
I think he's 30 yeah.

5232
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:21,120
Shogun shogun 35 that's old.

5233
02:20:22,221 --> 02:20:23,054
And I thought,

5234
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:27,020
and I thought he was 32 those are powerful
soon cause he was the shortest shorts

5235
02:20:27,021 --> 02:20:27,490
by far.

5236
02:20:27,490 --> 02:20:28,430
Anyone this actually,

5237
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:30,200
do you see how his right pack?

5238
02:20:30,201 --> 02:20:31,820
He's got some weird thing going on.

5239
02:20:31,821 --> 02:20:32,570
Like where it's,

5240
02:20:32,570 --> 02:20:34,490
it was pet connects over by shoulder.

5241
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:36,380
It's almost like something's torn there.

5242
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:39,030
Oh he looks soft

5243
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:41,493
closing it.

5244
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:44,300
Oh Jesus Christ.

5245
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:46,303
It looks,

5246
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:47,411
he looks fun.

5247
02:20:47,411 --> 02:20:49,580
Not Tell you it using
the soft cap very nicely.

5248
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:50,011
He's,

5249
02:20:50,011 --> 02:20:51,200
he's never had a good body.

5250
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:51,970
I now I know,

5251
02:20:51,970 --> 02:20:56,450
but it just a little softer in the mail
for 35 he looks pretty fucking good,

5252
02:20:56,451 --> 02:20:56,600
right?

5253
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:57,730
It doesn't look like it's a young,

5254
02:20:58,430 --> 02:20:59,270
he doesn't look bad,

5255
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:01,550
but this is a crazy way to fight.

5256
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:03,920
It's a crazy way to fight
shogun though in that I know,

5257
02:21:03,921 --> 02:21:06,170
but in Brazil still fucked.

5258
02:21:06,171 --> 02:21:07,340
We expect stand.

5259
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:08,070
Hey,

5260
02:21:08,070 --> 02:21:09,830
over the top of the right hand.

5261
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:11,810
Oh my God.

5262
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:12,861
Fuck.

5263
02:21:12,861 --> 02:21:16,410
Playing Shogun in Brazil and he's also
like to fight win streak three fight.

5264
02:21:16,411 --> 02:21:17,480
I mean he's ranked number six,

5265
02:21:17,481 --> 02:21:18,020
man.

5266
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:21,470
He's not like just some washed up that
[inaudible] is doing a good job at

5267
02:21:21,471 --> 02:21:24,580
keeping that left hand up high in
avoiding that big overhand cause.

5268
02:21:24,620 --> 02:21:26,020
He keeps him over the child though.

5269
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:27,620
You can count it over the top,

5270
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:33,630
but [inaudible] has been doing a
good job with see that blocking that

5271
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:36,570
one goes through,

5272
02:21:36,571 --> 02:21:36,800
right?

5273
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:37,261
That's getting,

5274
02:21:37,261 --> 02:21:38,410
he's getting cat that Jab.

5275
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:40,650
Come on over that Jab.

5276
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:44,810
They've abandoned kicks,

5277
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:46,430
abandoned kicks,

5278
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:47,960
abandoned kicks.

5279
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:49,210
Everyone's just wrestling.

5280
02:21:49,211 --> 02:21:50,060
Just fuck it.

5281
02:21:50,061 --> 02:21:51,830
Let's just box each eaches face.

5282
02:21:51,831 --> 02:21:55,760
That's when he tell dudes had been
dinged up and they get dinged up a little

5283
02:21:55,761 --> 02:21:55,971
bit.

5284
02:21:55,971 --> 02:21:56,391
Oh there you go.

5285
02:21:56,391 --> 02:22:00,440
Shogun throughs through like sort of a
halfhearted inside leg kick and you know

5286
02:22:00,441 --> 02:22:00,860
bill hunt,

5287
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:02,240
they can fucking wrestle.

5288
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:03,400
He takes students down.

5289
02:22:03,410 --> 02:22:04,520
He trains with Weidman

5290
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:06,193
but

5291
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:09,220
couldn't take a big deep
breath at two minutes ago.

5292
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,210
This is the way the high
pace for two oh five yeah.

5293
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:12,861
Oh Shit.

5294
02:22:12,861 --> 02:22:14,490
His Jab is starting to bust shogun ups.

5295
02:22:14,491 --> 02:22:18,710
He is eye that right eye and
the nose is that jab man.

5296
02:22:18,750 --> 02:22:20,710
You just shogun still fuck
with that unit brow still.

5297
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:21,553
It still rolls with it.

5298
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:22,413
You know Jimmy,

5299
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:25,740
he's like Anthony Davis
says it's my thing.

5300
02:22:25,770 --> 02:22:26,700
Oh Harry,

5301
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,553
you don't want wax.

5302
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:32,580
Oh cause not to train
with a wide main guy.

5303
02:22:33,810 --> 02:22:35,990
He also trains with WHO's out of the God,

5304
02:22:35,991 --> 02:22:37,600
the kickboxing Delmore kickboxing guy.

5305
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:39,870
Oh over the top of the right hand.

5306
02:22:40,090 --> 02:22:40,923
Oh

5307
02:22:42,450 --> 02:22:43,110
God.

5308
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:43,920
Damn.

5309
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,030
Both of them got granted.

5310
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:47,880
A GSPS kickbox and trainer.

5311
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:48,893
Which one?

5312
02:22:49,110 --> 02:22:50,910
Oh you're thinking of a field nurse.

5313
02:22:51,220 --> 02:22:51,360
Yeah.

5314
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:52,840
Does he still nurses,

5315
02:22:54,260 --> 02:22:55,093
trans guys.

5316
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:55,800
Trans Guy.

5317
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:57,470
Cause he was John's guy for a little bit.

5318
02:22:57,471 --> 02:22:58,680
And he was George Guy.

5319
02:22:58,890 --> 02:23:00,390
I don't see him in the background anymore.

5320
02:23:01,010 --> 02:23:02,670
I met with some guys.

5321
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:04,620
Oh Jesus Christ.

5322
02:23:05,130 --> 02:23:06,960
You're the most beautiful
gym I've ever seen.

5323
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:08,070
The Watt in New York City.

5324
02:23:08,071 --> 02:23:08,550
Yes.

5325
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:08,740
God.

5326
02:23:08,740 --> 02:23:08,890
Damn.

5327
02:23:08,890 --> 02:23:11,220
It must cost like $500 a month at least.

5328
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:13,190
How much does it cost to
work out there for you?

5329
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,033
If you had to guess?

5330
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:15,930
Everything is so expensive
in New York City.

5331
02:23:16,290 --> 02:23:17,970
$100,000 a month.

5332
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:20,920
It had guys.

5333
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:21,890
Good guess.

5334
02:23:21,890 --> 02:23:23,340
Good guess to find out.

5335
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:23,940
Jamie,

5336
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:27,480
what monthly rates are at
the Watt in New York City?

5337
02:23:27,481 --> 02:23:28,160
It's w.

5338
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:28,860
A.

5339
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:29,250
T.

5340
02:23:29,250 --> 02:23:30,820
It's all wood flooring and shit,

5341
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:32,640
like what is going on and then the ring.

5342
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:33,533
Oh Shit.

5343
02:23:33,570 --> 02:23:34,403
All Wood flooring.

5344
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:35,990
Is it like real stylish in there?

5345
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:37,111
It's beautiful,

5346
02:23:37,111 --> 02:23:37,800
man.

5347
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,060
He was a great kickboxer man.

5348
02:23:39,061 --> 02:23:39,601
Phil nurses,

5349
02:23:39,601 --> 02:23:42,050
a bad motherfucker and great coach too.

5350
02:23:42,110 --> 02:23:42,570
Yeah,

5351
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:43,560
he's better at money.

5352
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:46,680
It's so expensive for rent there.

5353
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:47,341
I mean,

5354
02:23:47,341 --> 02:23:47,760
what is,

5355
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:49,020
what is rent in New York City?

5356
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:49,621
It's insane.

5357
02:23:49,621 --> 02:23:50,730
Especially where he's at.

5358
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:52,310
Did you'd have talked to
people that have like a,

5359
02:23:52,311 --> 02:23:55,050
a tiny ass little apartment
and you talk to them.

5360
02:23:55,051 --> 02:23:55,231
You're like,

5361
02:23:55,231 --> 02:23:56,100
how much do you pay a month?

5362
02:23:56,101 --> 02:23:58,590
$4,000 for a studio.

5363
02:23:58,710 --> 02:24:03,710
So that means you have to make $50,000
a year just to pay for this apartment.

5364
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:04,890
Yeah,

5365
02:24:04,890 --> 02:24:05,790
that's insane.

5366
02:24:05,791 --> 02:24:06,624
Hundred Square feet.

5367
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:08,340
So if you make a hundred grand a year,

5368
02:24:08,460 --> 02:24:10,620
half of it is going to
your studio apartment.

5369
02:24:11,070 --> 02:24:12,120
Biggest problem is so much,

5370
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:15,330
so much Chinese and Russian and foreign
money moved into New York and started

5371
02:24:15,331 --> 02:24:16,164
buying problems.

5372
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:17,573
And so when they sit,

5373
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:20,070
they sit empty because it's a
safe place to put your money.

5374
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:23,850
So they built these towers where you
people are buying literally spending three

5375
02:24:23,851 --> 02:24:28,851
grand a square foot for apartments that
are sitting there empty and they rent

5376
02:24:29,191 --> 02:24:29,670
them out.

5377
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:30,460
Well,

5378
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:31,730
it's a place based solutions,

5379
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:33,510
a fairly rich to keep their money.

5380
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:34,321
I get it,

5381
02:24:34,321 --> 02:24:35,154
but we're going to be safe.

5382
02:24:35,550 --> 02:24:37,440
Can you say that Brennan Shop,

5383
02:24:37,441 --> 02:24:38,910
but in 10 years when you're

5384
02:24:40,490 --> 02:24:44,730
Paul and out of control and you decide
to buy some penthouse house up there and

5385
02:24:44,731 --> 02:24:45,600
just keep it be,

5386
02:24:45,810 --> 02:24:46,820
it's just for this,

5387
02:24:46,830 --> 02:24:48,060
for some sort of an investment.

5388
02:24:48,061 --> 02:24:48,421
You're right.

5389
02:24:48,421 --> 02:24:48,811
You're right,

5390
02:24:48,811 --> 02:24:49,170
Jill.

5391
02:24:49,170 --> 02:24:49,381
Yeah,

5392
02:24:49,381 --> 02:24:49,590
man.

5393
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:50,670
You would have some dope ass.

5394
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:51,900
I can have hosts.

5395
02:24:52,490 --> 02:24:53,990
That was one of the
best things about that.

5396
02:24:53,991 --> 02:24:55,440
A Dr strange movie.

5397
02:24:55,690 --> 02:24:56,880
The doctor strange movie.

5398
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:57,990
Oh shitty Cleveland with that.

5399
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,760
Right?

5400
02:24:58,760 --> 02:24:59,191
The doctor,

5401
02:24:59,191 --> 02:25:02,250
strange movie doctor strange before
he becomes the mystic spoiler alert.

5402
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:07,550
He lives in Manhattan and he has this
fucking insane view and that's like a real

5403
02:25:08,911 --> 02:25:09,181
thing.

5404
02:25:09,181 --> 02:25:11,820
Like you really can get a view like
that and some of those apartments are

5405
02:25:11,821 --> 02:25:13,630
scrooge McDuck and if he,

5406
02:25:13,650 --> 02:25:15,900
but if you can afford
that view at nighttime,

5407
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:19,620
God damn it is one of the most spectacular
things that you could see out your

5408
02:25:19,621 --> 02:25:20,850
windows in a place where you,

5409
02:25:20,851 --> 02:25:24,850
I think that I think like
being in Manhattan that and
then only like a dope ass

5410
02:25:24,851 --> 02:25:27,520
crib in Malibu facing the
beach doesn't give a shit.

5411
02:25:27,570 --> 02:25:28,810
Oh those two things together.

5412
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:29,673
Yes.

5413
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:31,480
The problem is like what
are you doing there though?

5414
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:32,590
What are you doing in New York City?

5415
02:25:32,591 --> 02:25:37,150
Just going to restaurants and
having parties come stand girl.

5416
02:25:37,151 --> 02:25:38,740
I might just stay home
and look out the window.

5417
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:39,940
I might be like,

5418
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:40,390
well look,

5419
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:41,890
if you want the one get,

5420
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:43,300
you got to want to get rich.

5421
02:25:43,301 --> 02:25:43,541
Right?

5422
02:25:43,541 --> 02:25:44,530
So why do you want to get rich?

5423
02:25:44,531 --> 02:25:47,260
While I want to be able to do whatever
I want and I want to be able to go nice

5424
02:25:47,261 --> 02:25:47,651
places.

5425
02:25:47,651 --> 02:25:49,480
I want to be able to eat nice food and,

5426
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:50,333
and see nice things.

5427
02:25:50,410 --> 02:25:50,860
Okay,

5428
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:55,030
well let's add up all those experiences
and how cool are they in comparison to

5429
02:25:55,031 --> 02:25:57,150
looking out your window?

5430
02:25:57,790 --> 02:25:58,330
Yeah,

5431
02:25:58,330 --> 02:26:02,500
and I would have fucking
spectacular 30 story view.

5432
02:26:03,130 --> 02:26:05,260
Think if you had this studio up then,

5433
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:06,730
now they're little background.

5434
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:07,810
Now you're with your boys.

5435
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:11,320
Well I was thinking about
renting a place downtown.

5436
02:26:11,321 --> 02:26:11,470
No,

5437
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:12,110
just,

5438
02:26:12,110 --> 02:26:12,290
oh,

5439
02:26:12,290 --> 02:26:12,720
sorry.

5440
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:13,553
Sorry.

5441
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:14,543
Let's get in the way.

5442
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:17,050
Isn't that what people,

5443
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:19,600
when you think about the guy who was
born with lots of money and he's got that

5444
02:26:19,601 --> 02:26:20,434
crazy crab,

5445
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:21,311
what you really think?

5446
02:26:21,311 --> 02:26:21,950
Let's be honest.

5447
02:26:21,950 --> 02:26:22,710
Opposite thing.

5448
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:22,930
Oh,

5449
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:23,501
it's amazing.

5450
02:26:23,501 --> 02:26:24,011
Good food.

5451
02:26:24,011 --> 02:26:27,310
Champagne slots for days.

5452
02:26:27,311 --> 02:26:30,580
I mean that's what most behind like
that guy's got to be banging like,

5453
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:31,300
you know,

5454
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:31,901
I dunno how,

5455
02:26:31,901 --> 02:26:32,734
I'm sorry.

5456
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:35,433
Wow.

5457
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:39,040
That shit during women's nice guy.

5458
02:26:39,041 --> 02:26:39,790
Sorry.

5459
02:26:39,790 --> 02:26:40,910
Women's month or do they go,

5460
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:41,990
uh,

5461
02:26:41,990 --> 02:26:43,960
let's see what other people think,

5462
02:26:43,961 --> 02:26:47,370
Dan Bilzerian so he's going to
want you to think that guys say,

5463
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:47,620
hey,

5464
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:50,930
that's someone's job or bending
over for Sushi right now.

5465
02:26:50,931 --> 02:26:51,764
Could be that shit.

5466
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:52,391
Come on,

5467
02:26:52,391 --> 02:26:53,080
look at that.

5468
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:55,900
It's been over in a g g string.

5469
02:26:55,930 --> 02:26:56,860
He's out of control.

5470
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:57,461
No,

5471
02:26:57,461 --> 02:26:58,330
he's totally in control.

5472
02:26:58,400 --> 02:26:58,721
I mean,

5473
02:26:58,721 --> 02:26:59,051
it's just,

5474
02:26:59,051 --> 02:26:59,300
that's,

5475
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:00,041
that's what I mean.

5476
02:27:00,041 --> 02:27:00,874
That's what everybody,

5477
02:27:01,170 --> 02:27:01,750
that's a way,

5478
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:02,770
that's where you spend your money,

5479
02:27:02,771 --> 02:27:03,041
dude.

5480
02:27:03,041 --> 02:27:04,720
Hashtag International Women's Day,

5481
02:27:04,721 --> 02:27:05,091
Pete,

5482
02:27:05,091 --> 02:27:05,924
painful.

5483
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:07,510
What's wrong with that dude?

5484
02:27:07,750 --> 02:27:08,650
Seven fun.

5485
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:09,161
Yeah.

5486
02:27:09,161 --> 02:27:09,994
He's held

5487
02:27:11,410 --> 02:27:12,460
no regrets there.

5488
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:14,740
John Volante starting to pour it on here.

5489
02:27:14,741 --> 02:27:19,741
He's stepping in with that jab and Shogun
keeps throwing that looping overhand.

5490
02:27:19,811 --> 02:27:20,230
Right?

5491
02:27:20,230 --> 02:27:21,850
It's finding a lame a little bit.

5492
02:27:21,870 --> 02:27:22,703
Sometimes it,

5493
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:24,970
sometimes he clipped him on
the temple and dropped them.

5494
02:27:24,990 --> 02:27:25,823
There's your months,

5495
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:27,430
you know,

5496
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:28,360
that's the same overhand,

5497
02:27:28,361 --> 02:27:29,440
right that he knocked out.

5498
02:27:29,450 --> 02:27:30,281
I'm not.

5499
02:27:30,281 --> 02:27:31,920
I'm Liotta with Wimber.

5500
02:27:31,930 --> 02:27:32,341
He caught it.

5501
02:27:32,341 --> 02:27:33,174
It was at the top.

5502
02:27:33,310 --> 02:27:34,143
Ooh.

5503
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:36,400
He tagged him with that right hand.

5504
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:37,721
Really aren't.

5505
02:27:37,721 --> 02:27:38,380
They looked a little,

5506
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:38,880
well,

5507
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,960
I think they've been paying it
so he should be a little fatigue.

5508
02:27:41,170 --> 02:27:42,370
They're both a little fatigued.

5509
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:44,620
Do not quit though,

5510
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:45,730
and just fucking off.

5511
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:46,713
It looks bigger.

5512
02:27:48,310 --> 02:27:49,210
It looks way bigger.

5513
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:50,433
He's a big boy.

5514
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:52,180
He's been doing really well with that Jab.

5515
02:27:52,181 --> 02:27:54,730
But look at that counter of that
right hand over the top right there.

5516
02:27:54,731 --> 02:27:55,564
That was clean.

5517
02:27:55,810 --> 02:27:57,960
And then Sjogren's patient on in too.

5518
02:27:57,970 --> 02:27:58,721
When he puts it together,

5519
02:27:58,721 --> 02:27:59,770
he was just all in one shot there.

5520
02:27:59,771 --> 02:28:00,820
Now when he puts two together,

5521
02:28:00,821 --> 02:28:02,320
they'd lay in two to three land forum.

5522
02:28:02,380 --> 02:28:04,660
I'm shocked at how much these
guys have abandoned their cakes.

5523
02:28:04,810 --> 02:28:05,643
Shocked.

5524
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:06,553
Zubin one.

5525
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:06,851
Yeah,

5526
02:28:06,851 --> 02:28:07,840
there's been a few early.

5527
02:28:08,050 --> 02:28:09,340
They're kind of exchanging blows too,

5528
02:28:09,341 --> 02:28:09,850
aren't they?

5529
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:10,683
Just

5530
02:28:11,690 --> 02:28:12,580
slobber knocker right?

5531
02:28:12,581 --> 02:28:13,414
Yeah,

5532
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:18,010
but I mean Jesus shoguns wobbled a little,

5533
02:28:18,011 --> 02:28:18,844
cracked him,

5534
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:21,070
but it's just like these guys are,

5535
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:22,610
they're heavy on their legs.

5536
02:28:23,140 --> 02:28:24,680
If somebody's uncorked,

5537
02:28:24,681 --> 02:28:26,000
a solid leg kick there.

5538
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:27,410
Isn't that Sjogren's thing?

5539
02:28:27,450 --> 02:28:28,430
Canty oh yeah.

5540
02:28:28,431 --> 02:28:30,230
Well he can kick the fuck out of here.

5541
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:31,620
I could volunteer with the take down.

5542
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,473
Not Up.

5543
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:35,300
We assumed as don't bring
that shit into my cage.

5544
02:28:35,301 --> 02:28:37,250
Don't ever bring that shit into my cage,

5545
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:37,631
Brian,

5546
02:28:37,631 --> 02:28:39,270
that you are back in the movie again.

5547
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:39,891
I'm just saying.

5548
02:28:39,891 --> 02:28:40,640
That's what I say.

5549
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:42,110
It's what I fucking say.

5550
02:28:42,111 --> 02:28:42,830
Feel it.

5551
02:28:42,830 --> 02:28:43,670
Feel it right now.

5552
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:45,410
Don't bring that shit into my cage.

5553
02:28:45,740 --> 02:28:47,420
Oh,

5554
02:28:47,430 --> 02:28:48,920
that's how you wobbled him with that dude.

5555
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:50,060
Oh Jesus.

5556
02:28:50,090 --> 02:28:51,260
Oh Shit.

5557
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:52,310
We slept.

5558
02:28:52,310 --> 02:28:53,000
Oh boy.

5559
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:53,211
Yeah,

5560
02:28:53,211 --> 02:28:54,021
but he's in trouble.

5561
02:28:54,021 --> 02:28:54,854
He's in trouble.

5562
02:28:55,010 --> 02:28:55,820
A little and wobbly.

5563
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:56,060
Oh,

5564
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:57,410
he got right back up.

5565
02:28:57,440 --> 02:28:57,890
Wow.

5566
02:28:57,890 --> 02:28:58,490
Take some space.

5567
02:28:58,490 --> 02:28:59,270
He's just tired.

5568
02:28:59,270 --> 02:28:59,721
He's tough.

5569
02:28:59,721 --> 02:29:00,760
Ish as this top.

5570
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:01,420
That's fine.

5571
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:03,140
This is only the second round kids.

5572
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:04,130
This pace is nuts,

5573
02:29:04,131 --> 02:29:04,400
man.

5574
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:05,211
Especially the blows.

5575
02:29:05,211 --> 02:29:05,451
Oh,

5576
02:29:05,451 --> 02:29:08,340
she always in that shogun
spreading in this field.

5577
02:29:08,730 --> 02:29:10,730
Opening it for the shoe box.

5578
02:29:10,731 --> 02:29:11,930
Old School Combo.

5579
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:12,621
Shut the box.

5580
02:29:12,621 --> 02:29:13,454
Shut the box.

5581
02:29:14,530 --> 02:29:14,960
She,

5582
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:16,190
when you watch shogun fight,

5583
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:17,000
you just want to go.

5584
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,810
Just think of how many wars
this guy's been in the gym.

5585
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:24,500
They get how many wars this guy's been
in the ring and then in the cage it's

5586
02:29:24,501 --> 02:29:25,151
still doing the day.

5587
02:29:25,151 --> 02:29:29,270
I'm still doing it and he just wants
to pluck as utero stuff saying,

5588
02:29:29,271 --> 02:29:29,841
hey man,

5589
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:31,810
I'm [inaudible] to my left.

5590
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:34,940
As I respect the absolute warrior,

5591
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:38,060
like that's how I would describe him.

5592
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:40,190
Like he's just doing the damn thing.

5593
02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:43,530
Loves to fight again
with that overhand right.

5594
02:29:43,531 --> 02:29:43,880
He's,

5595
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:45,440
he keeps timing that well,

5596
02:29:46,970 --> 02:29:48,440
he's starting to find openings to,

5597
02:29:48,441 --> 02:29:50,580
I think a lot of that is also
going to the body enough.

5598
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:51,990
The more it's going to body.

5599
02:29:51,991 --> 02:29:52,261
Yeah.

5600
02:29:52,261 --> 02:29:52,851
A little baby.

5601
02:29:52,851 --> 02:29:54,380
One little head movement.

5602
02:29:54,430 --> 02:29:55,070
A little movement,

5603
02:29:55,070 --> 02:29:55,251
man.

5604
02:29:55,251 --> 02:29:59,270
I'm not mad at Shogun sweep that
folks can leg looks really good.

5605
02:29:59,271 --> 02:30:00,740
I mean he's taking some shots but,

5606
02:30:00,770 --> 02:30:01,430
and philosophies,

5607
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:02,151
no choke man.

5608
02:30:02,151 --> 02:30:02,661
Not at all,

5609
02:30:02,661 --> 02:30:02,990
man.

5610
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:04,180
So he keeps calling the custody.

5611
02:30:04,190 --> 02:30:05,920
I like how he's going to
the body and mix it up.

5612
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:06,741
You guys ever read that book?

5613
02:30:06,741 --> 02:30:07,071
Shogun?

5614
02:30:07,071 --> 02:30:07,904
It's great.

5615
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:08,840
I don't think it's the same thing.

5616
02:30:08,841 --> 02:30:09,674
Okay.

5617
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:11,900
There his brother Ninja,

5618
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:13,490
he retired from concussion.

5619
02:30:13,491 --> 02:30:14,630
He had some brain injuries.

5620
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:16,100
He had to get like surgery.

5621
02:30:16,190 --> 02:30:16,760
Oh Jeez.

5622
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:17,930
Oh,

5623
02:30:17,931 --> 02:30:19,220
we deemed them with that right.

5624
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:20,560
Is for Rodley.

5625
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:22,281
Ooo,

5626
02:30:22,281 --> 02:30:24,170
think about suddenly shogun looks bigger.

5627
02:30:24,350 --> 02:30:24,650
Female.

5628
02:30:24,650 --> 02:30:25,250
Billy Anthony's.

5629
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:26,400
It's freaking Baca to,

5630
02:30:26,570 --> 02:30:28,070
he's middle linebacker at Hofstra.

5631
02:30:28,071 --> 02:30:31,240
So there has to be some sort of
brain damage you'd think game.

5632
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:33,110
Hmm.

5633
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:33,650
More.

5634
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:35,300
He's one of those dudes
where it's no offense,

5635
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:35,870
you know,

5636
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:36,930
he's just one of those dudes to it.

5637
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:38,450
Those dudes don't exist.

5638
02:30:38,451 --> 02:30:40,160
Remember that Samoan Guy was shot himself?

5639
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:41,173
What was his name?

5640
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:42,753
Yeah.

5641
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:45,710
That guy is like,

5642
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:48,290
no one's more durable than 15 years.

5643
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:52,160
They like the most durable human beings
on the planet and everybody gets it in

5644
02:30:52,161 --> 02:30:52,994
the long run.

5645
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:54,300
More content.

5646
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:55,400
I begged the for.

5647
02:30:55,730 --> 02:30:57,030
He's not really that laugh.

5648
02:30:57,050 --> 02:31:00,050
The last one I seen him
go flatline like that.

5649
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:01,670
Only in the Melvin Manhoef fight.

5650
02:31:01,671 --> 02:31:02,620
Remember Melvin column?

5651
02:31:02,650 --> 02:31:03,483
I

5652
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:05,151
fought him.

5653
02:31:05,151 --> 02:31:06,950
He says he is.

5654
02:31:07,070 --> 02:31:07,290
Yes.

5655
02:31:07,290 --> 02:31:08,030
Smaller than him.

5656
02:31:08,030 --> 02:31:08,331
Hi.

5657
02:31:08,331 --> 02:31:10,760
Smaller Melvin was one 80 oh my God.

5658
02:31:10,770 --> 02:31:13,250
Your mom close to 60 oh my God.

5659
02:31:13,251 --> 02:31:18,251
And Melvin Kao them with One Punch Card
and k one or one straight powers was the

5660
02:31:19,051 --> 02:31:19,920
key one or pride.

5661
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:20,850
Was it pride?

5662
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:25,050
I feel like it was k one it
was definitely an MMA fight.

5663
02:31:25,050 --> 02:31:26,220
It wasn't a kickboxing fight,

5664
02:31:26,221 --> 02:31:27,270
but it might've been pride,

5665
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:29,430
but either way he see
if you could find that.

5666
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:29,701
Jeremy,

5667
02:31:29,701 --> 02:31:30,150
what did this,

5668
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:31,910
oh my pride.

5669
02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:32,963
That's pride bro.

5670
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:33,271
No,

5671
02:31:33,271 --> 02:31:34,140
it's k one dynamite.

5672
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:34,471
Oh,

5673
02:31:34,471 --> 02:31:35,400
that's what it is.

5674
02:31:35,970 --> 02:31:36,601
Oh yeah,

5675
02:31:36,601 --> 02:31:37,590
watch this Brian.

5676
02:31:37,591 --> 02:31:39,930
Cause this is crazy because Melvin is,

5677
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:41,700
I mean at the most,

5678
02:31:42,660 --> 02:31:43,201
at the most,

5679
02:31:43,201 --> 02:31:44,011
he's 200 pounds,

5680
02:31:44,011 --> 02:31:45,710
but I don't think it not to Honda.

5681
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:49,260
I think he's one 95 yeah.

5682
02:31:49,261 --> 02:31:51,660
Well he fought Robbie
Lawler 85 and strike force,

5683
02:31:51,661 --> 02:31:54,300
which means he's probably a little heavier
than that and losing weight to get to

5684
02:31:54,301 --> 02:31:56,870
85 so let's say he's 95 what's this sound?

5685
02:31:56,910 --> 02:31:57,840
The benefit of the doubt.

5686
02:31:58,470 --> 02:32:01,380
So mark is at least 60
pounds heavier than him.

5687
02:32:01,410 --> 02:32:04,940
Maybe that Japanese shit folk.

5688
02:32:04,941 --> 02:32:06,180
And it happens in the first round.

5689
02:32:06,181 --> 02:32:07,710
He's got two seconds in.

5690
02:32:08,150 --> 02:32:08,370
No,

5691
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:09,390
those are pride gloves.

5692
02:32:09,570 --> 02:32:11,070
It was the same as the k one gloves.

5693
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:11,941
They were a,

5694
02:32:11,941 --> 02:32:12,960
they were just different.

5695
02:32:12,990 --> 02:32:15,120
They look like they were
more padded than they were.

5696
02:32:15,290 --> 02:32:15,991
I count fast,

5697
02:32:15,991 --> 02:32:16,201
man.

5698
02:32:16,201 --> 02:32:16,491
Hope it's,

5699
02:32:16,491 --> 02:32:17,160
look at this.

5700
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:17,401
Boom,

5701
02:32:17,401 --> 02:32:17,820
boom.

5702
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:19,630
Oh my God.

5703
02:32:19,660 --> 02:32:20,493
Taught him coming in.

5704
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:21,480
Wow.

5705
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:21,751
Dude.

5706
02:32:21,751 --> 02:32:24,860
I would say it's worse
because it's flatlined.

5707
02:32:24,930 --> 02:32:26,340
It was for a short guy.

5708
02:32:26,341 --> 02:32:27,660
Never fought in the UFC.

5709
02:32:28,830 --> 02:32:29,640
Melvin never caught.

5710
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:30,740
Just fucking put some,

5711
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:33,550
oh we went to the body.

5712
02:32:34,930 --> 02:32:36,700
Her Sjogren's.

5713
02:32:36,750 --> 02:32:38,280
Not fucking around everybody.

5714
02:32:38,490 --> 02:32:39,323
There we go.

5715
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:41,880
That's it.

5716
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:42,450
That's it.

5717
02:32:42,450 --> 02:32:43,820
There's only so much you can take,

5718
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:44,030
dude.

5719
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:44,863
You see?

5720
02:32:45,510 --> 02:32:47,100
Oh Wow.

5721
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:49,590
Shit kidding me.

5722
02:32:49,940 --> 02:32:52,290
We were watching an old fight
while the new one was going on.

5723
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:56,150
I got double knockdown at the
velocities of fucking warrior.

5724
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,240
The shoguns too much.

5725
02:32:57,241 --> 02:32:58,410
Holy Shit.

5726
02:32:58,411 --> 02:32:59,190
God.

5727
02:32:59,190 --> 02:33:00,150
Holy Shit.

5728
02:33:01,810 --> 02:33:02,130
Now,

5729
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:05,570
if shogun decides to go
out now after that respect,

5730
02:33:07,690 --> 02:33:08,770
respect goes out,

5731
02:33:08,900 --> 02:33:10,820
it goes back to rising.

5732
02:33:11,230 --> 02:33:12,063
Um,

5733
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:14,400
revives his career with the TRT

5734
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:17,130
top five after this

5735
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:21,840
nice place for older
MMA fighters to go to.

5736
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:22,470
Well,

5737
02:33:22,470 --> 02:33:26,940
it would be nice if there was a place
like pride was in its glory days and if

5738
02:33:26,941 --> 02:33:27,774
it's rising,

5739
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:28,500
so be it.

5740
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:30,090
There's that Russia clipped him,

5741
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:32,160
he caught him coming and
clipped him right in the jaw.

5742
02:33:32,250 --> 02:33:32,461
See,

5743
02:33:32,461 --> 02:33:33,990
I put the brakes on to the body,

5744
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:36,480
to the body and cardio.

5745
02:33:36,481 --> 02:33:36,941
How does it build it?

5746
02:33:36,941 --> 02:33:39,020
And it's just part on like that boom,

5747
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:40,140
that's smelling blood in the water.

5748
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:41,450
Oh boom.

5749
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:42,001
Oh,

5750
02:33:42,001 --> 02:33:42,930
this is ruthless.

5751
02:33:43,350 --> 02:33:47,970
That is a fucking phenomenal
combination around tires.

5752
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:49,913
But look how he doesn't,

5753
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:53,490
he just clipped him with that right hand.

5754
02:33:53,810 --> 02:33:54,643
That true.

5755
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:57,600
The body to the body there.

5756
02:33:57,630 --> 02:33:58,463
I like how he does it.

5757
02:33:58,900 --> 02:34:00,120
He doesn't rush in here.

5758
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:02,880
How do you keep the distance
so maximum power hip.

5759
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:03,930
Oh Man.

5760
02:34:03,930 --> 02:34:05,580
Fuck No.

5761
02:34:06,030 --> 02:34:06,930
So good.

5762
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:09,300
That's so incredible.

5763
02:34:10,350 --> 02:34:11,430
Great Wind for Shogun.

5764
02:34:11,650 --> 02:34:16,050
Fuck Craig whinge when I makes
me feel good when he wins.

5765
02:34:16,051 --> 02:34:17,590
For some reason I'm crazy.

5766
02:34:17,591 --> 02:34:20,200
It must have been in
Brazil to hear that roar.

5767
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:22,980
It must have went crazy.

5768
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:24,790
Fucking pulls it off.

5769
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:25,571
Oh my God,

5770
02:34:25,571 --> 02:34:26,111
I'm so glad.

5771
02:34:26,111 --> 02:34:27,350
I don't know what happened either.

5772
02:34:27,390 --> 02:34:28,223
I don't have a clue

5773
02:34:29,650 --> 02:34:30,221
what is poor.

5774
02:34:30,221 --> 02:34:31,054
I mean,

5775
02:34:31,390 --> 02:34:32,223
I'm not sure.

5776
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:33,010
Something good.

5777
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:33,131
Yeah,

5778
02:34:33,131 --> 02:34:35,590
he's never been had the right body pull.

5779
02:34:35,591 --> 02:34:37,820
Hot means like Fuck Paul.

5780
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:40,060
Hi Paul fucking man body.

5781
02:34:40,270 --> 02:34:41,110
He's a dime piece.

5782
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:42,550
This is going a man's body.

5783
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:45,580
Brazil real lady polar.

5784
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:46,301
Yeah,

5785
02:34:46,301 --> 02:34:46,751
I'm sure.

5786
02:34:46,751 --> 02:34:47,890
He's a man and I'm,

5787
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:48,581
well,

5788
02:34:48,581 --> 02:34:48,941
he's a,

5789
02:34:48,941 --> 02:34:51,280
he's also the sporting legend over there.

5790
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:53,830
He's like Michael joining the
streets of Chicago over the,

5791
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:54,550
let me stop.

5792
02:34:54,550 --> 02:34:55,570
Probably not that much,

5793
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:55,991
but dude,

5794
02:34:55,991 --> 02:34:57,730
him and [inaudible] and Samson.

5795
02:34:58,270 --> 02:34:58,991
Leo was saying,

5796
02:34:58,991 --> 02:35:00,010
one of the reasons why he lives here.

5797
02:35:00,011 --> 02:35:00,671
She goes back there.

5798
02:35:00,671 --> 02:35:01,780
They can't even go out to eat,

5799
02:35:01,781 --> 02:35:02,110
man.

5800
02:35:02,110 --> 02:35:02,440
Really?

5801
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:04,060
But she didn't do anything really.

5802
02:35:04,061 --> 02:35:05,200
It's one of the reasons I live here.

5803
02:35:05,201 --> 02:35:06,040
It's just crazy.

5804
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:07,420
Like he goes back all the time,

5805
02:35:07,421 --> 02:35:07,691
you know?

5806
02:35:07,691 --> 02:35:12,490
But for like v Tor Amston
Liotta you're shopping and big,

5807
02:35:12,491 --> 02:35:13,324
big nog.

5808
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:15,520
But think about bigger stars.

5809
02:35:15,521 --> 02:35:15,641
I mean,

5810
02:35:15,641 --> 02:35:17,080
it gets the Brazilian soccer team,

5811
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:17,831
but those are,

5812
02:35:17,831 --> 02:35:18,551
that's the shit,

5813
02:35:18,551 --> 02:35:18,791
man.

5814
02:35:18,791 --> 02:35:21,350
Brazil fighting peanut
butter and Jelly Sun.

5815
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:22,833
That's a good point.

5816
02:35:22,870 --> 02:35:23,231
Here.

5817
02:35:23,231 --> 02:35:23,621
We're like,

5818
02:35:23,621 --> 02:35:23,831
Eh,

5819
02:35:23,831 --> 02:35:24,250
whatever.

5820
02:35:24,250 --> 02:35:25,083
I bet hoists,

5821
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:26,340
voice calls over there.

5822
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:27,370
It's probably preposterous.

5823
02:35:28,330 --> 02:35:28,610
Yeah.

5824
02:35:28,610 --> 02:35:29,443
Gracie.

5825
02:35:29,650 --> 02:35:29,850
Yeah,

5826
02:35:29,850 --> 02:35:32,890
probably can't we can Tim Tebow
style you can't go anyway.

5827
02:35:33,220 --> 02:35:34,690
There's a lot of fun movies coming out,

5828
02:35:34,691 --> 02:35:35,320
man.

5829
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:37,900
This life one looks kind of interesting.

5830
02:35:37,930 --> 02:35:38,920
Did that new alien.

5831
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:39,783
See the way,

5832
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:42,020
I can't wait for that.

5833
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:43,060
That's terrifying.

5834
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:44,660
Great.

5835
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:45,493
Uh,

5836
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:48,280
all those movies were amazing to have
anything to do with the other ones.

5837
02:35:48,281 --> 02:35:48,760
Is it?

5838
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:49,590
Oh yeah,

5839
02:35:49,590 --> 02:35:50,670
it's about before.

5840
02:35:50,710 --> 02:35:53,110
It's about before you know
how they pitched that movie?

5841
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:58,120
Legend has this wasn't Prometheans
kind of medias from ets before the more

5842
02:35:59,201 --> 02:35:59,681
recent one.

5843
02:35:59,681 --> 02:35:59,891
Yeah.

5844
02:35:59,891 --> 02:36:00,724
I liked promethium.

5845
02:36:01,090 --> 02:36:03,520
Promethium has something to do with alien.

5846
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:04,151
Yes.

5847
02:36:04,151 --> 02:36:05,080
That's the start.

5848
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:08,240
The idea is that big guy in Prometheans,

5849
02:36:08,250 --> 02:36:10,420
those weird alien people looking things,

5850
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:12,430
those were aliens from another planet.

5851
02:36:12,431 --> 02:36:14,890
They got jacked by the alien alien first

5852
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:21,900
prometheus's when that gigantic star
ships spaceship crashes on top of that

5853
02:36:22,331 --> 02:36:23,280
chick and kills.

5854
02:36:23,730 --> 02:36:24,190
No,

5855
02:36:24,190 --> 02:36:25,480
she crawls out from underneath.

5856
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:26,710
Well some protected her.

5857
02:36:26,711 --> 02:36:28,930
It's the movie the whole super,

5858
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:30,500
super important that they follow.

5859
02:36:30,501 --> 02:36:33,430
The child didn't fucking
have anything to do with it.

5860
02:36:33,990 --> 02:36:34,631
You know what they say?

5861
02:36:34,631 --> 02:36:34,871
The,

5862
02:36:34,871 --> 02:36:38,170
the legend has it has soul
that the alien in the movie,

5863
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:40,030
like in the room when they walked in,

5864
02:36:40,031 --> 02:36:40,864
the producers went,

5865
02:36:41,310 --> 02:36:42,071
so what's your pitch?

5866
02:36:42,071 --> 02:36:44,930
And they went cias and
space you interested in?

5867
02:36:44,931 --> 02:36:45,730
They're like,

5868
02:36:45,730 --> 02:36:46,563
yes we are here.

5869
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:51,250
Well they that HR Giger guy,

5870
02:36:51,251 --> 02:36:55,640
that artists sort of revolutionized
what we thought horror monster.

5871
02:36:55,641 --> 02:37:00,100
So He created something that was so
entirely different than any other alien

5872
02:37:00,101 --> 02:37:00,731
landscape.

5873
02:37:00,731 --> 02:37:01,121
A foreign,

5874
02:37:01,121 --> 02:37:04,990
very dark and evil and say tannic
in some sort of a weird way.

5875
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:09,460
And also that alien itself was so
much different than any other idea.

5876
02:37:09,461 --> 02:37:12,100
We had always had this idea of like
the super intelligent things from other

5877
02:37:12,101 --> 02:37:12,910
planets.

5878
02:37:12,910 --> 02:37:13,421
If someone was like,

5879
02:37:13,421 --> 02:37:13,840
no.

5880
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:18,170
How about a giant bug thing that just
eats everything I could find and grows

5881
02:37:18,171 --> 02:37:19,004
like that.

5882
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:20,410
Plants.

5883
02:37:20,410 --> 02:37:21,770
It's egg in your body.

5884
02:37:21,890 --> 02:37:22,340
Yeah.

5885
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:26,210
How about guys watch
salient you guys into that?

5886
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:27,200
No.

5887
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:28,033
Fuck that noise.

5888
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:30,440
As soon as they started
doing that all the time.

5889
02:37:30,670 --> 02:37:30,851
Sorry,

5890
02:37:30,851 --> 02:37:31,240
I said it.

5891
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:32,073
What was that?

5892
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:35,410
Dracula versus the wolf man.

5893
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:36,140
I like,

5894
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:38,540
I don't like when they
mixed them Predator though.

5895
02:37:39,410 --> 02:37:39,741
They should.

5896
02:37:39,741 --> 02:37:41,810
They have like Predator
versus fast and furious.

5897
02:37:41,811 --> 02:37:44,660
All those shit racing their
cars on residential roads.

5898
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:46,130
I'll get mark by Predator.

5899
02:37:46,190 --> 02:37:47,120
I'd pay for that.

5900
02:37:47,330 --> 02:37:49,370
I watched one of those fast and the
furious the other day and we were like,

5901
02:37:49,371 --> 02:37:50,270
how many of them were there?

5902
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:51,290
And then we looked it up.

5903
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:54,650
There was 10 10 of them making
a bunch of them fucking movies.

5904
02:37:54,651 --> 02:37:55,484
There was 10,

5905
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:57,080
10 81 right now.

5906
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:58,340
What really on the eighth one,

5907
02:37:58,341 --> 02:37:58,521
Ryan,

5908
02:37:58,521 --> 02:37:59,354
come on.

5909
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:00,440
They're doing more though.

5910
02:38:00,980 --> 02:38:01,813
F Eight is coming.

5911
02:38:01,850 --> 02:38:02,661
Why did it say 10?

5912
02:38:02,661 --> 02:38:03,494
When I go to the,

5913
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:05,450
well they might be under contract with 10.

5914
02:38:05,530 --> 02:38:06,580
They're doing more Joe,

5915
02:38:06,690 --> 02:38:07,523
is that what it is?

5916
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:08,360
You,

5917
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:09,140
uh,

5918
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:11,270
you know the redoing
Predator without our own,

5919
02:38:11,271 --> 02:38:11,751
first of all,

5920
02:38:11,751 --> 02:38:12,830
how can you just pull that out?

5921
02:38:12,831 --> 02:38:14,430
How do you know how many fast,

5922
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:15,320
why would you,

5923
02:38:15,320 --> 02:38:16,380
why would you have that infamous?

5924
02:38:16,381 --> 02:38:18,680
Paul's a big giant like
billboard or on their way here,

5925
02:38:18,681 --> 02:38:21,140
like at a Hollywood and
whatever Franklin or something.

5926
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:23,570
I don't get down with those action movies,

5927
02:38:23,571 --> 02:38:23,781
man.

5928
02:38:23,781 --> 02:38:24,614
Do nothing for me.

5929
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:29,830
It says there are 10 fast and the furious
movies in the works I'm contracting

5930
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:31,490
to.

5931
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:33,290
Who's going to play
hardball with New Predator?

5932
02:38:33,350 --> 02:38:34,940
Enjoy that rush or the,

5933
02:38:35,020 --> 02:38:35,241
you know,

5934
02:38:35,241 --> 02:38:36,320
the remake and Scarface.

5935
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:37,970
Who's gonna play fucking Tony Montana?

5936
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:41,780
Vin diesel confirms fast and furious.

5937
02:38:41,781 --> 02:38:42,051
Eight,

5938
02:38:42,051 --> 02:38:43,100
nine and 10.

5939
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:44,060
That's what it is.

5940
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:45,470
Just pushed avatar back.

5941
02:38:45,490 --> 02:38:46,250
Hold another year.

5942
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:47,700
Ah,

5943
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:48,670
Fuck Jamie.

5944
02:38:49,220 --> 02:38:51,590
Why something yesterday,

5945
02:38:51,591 --> 02:38:54,260
James Cameron probably
drown somebody accidentally.

5946
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:54,881
Dude,

5947
02:38:54,881 --> 02:38:57,230
one of his crazy ass fucking submarines.

5948
02:38:57,480 --> 02:38:58,313
Dammit.

5949
02:38:58,580 --> 02:38:59,030
I mean,

5950
02:38:59,030 --> 02:38:59,840
how did you release?

5951
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,850
Have to fucking how many years?

5952
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:02,840
15 years later.

5953
02:39:03,110 --> 02:39:04,820
It's two lost to be sick though.

5954
02:39:05,180 --> 02:39:07,690
Entourage fucking movie talk.

5955
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:08,780
Compare those to you,

5956
02:39:08,781 --> 02:39:09,860
son of a bitch.

5957
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:14,130
Bitch Avatar to PR.

5958
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:15,073
Oh my God,

5959
02:39:15,550 --> 02:39:18,140
that's an 18 when was
it supposed to come out?

5960
02:39:18,141 --> 02:39:18,974
Jamie?

5961
02:39:19,010 --> 02:39:21,440
2018 when he's supposed to come out this
year is supposed to come out next year,

5962
02:39:21,441 --> 02:39:22,670
but they pushed it back farther.

5963
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:24,290
When's it going to arrive?

5964
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:26,360
Maybe 2019 wow.

5965
02:39:26,361 --> 02:39:27,470
So it will be 10 years.

5966
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:28,250
Wow.

5967
02:39:28,250 --> 02:39:29,690
Oh No.

5968
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:30,650
Look what he says though,

5969
02:39:30,651 --> 02:39:30,951
son.

5970
02:39:30,951 --> 02:39:32,150
We're not making it up to a two.

5971
02:39:32,151 --> 02:39:32,930
We're making an Avatar.

5972
02:39:32,930 --> 02:39:33,201
Two,

5973
02:39:33,201 --> 02:39:33,501
three,

5974
02:39:33,501 --> 02:39:33,801
four,

5975
02:39:33,801 --> 02:39:34,460
and five.

5976
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:35,293
They're making all them.

5977
02:39:37,010 --> 02:39:40,630
Epic undertaking director says a
franchise around 2009 blockbuster.

5978
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:42,660
So they're going to do them all together.

5979
02:39:42,670 --> 02:39:43,041
Forgive.

5980
02:39:43,041 --> 02:39:44,240
And so they're going to have one.

5981
02:39:44,270 --> 02:39:46,400
They're going to release another
one and then another one afterwards.

5982
02:39:46,401 --> 02:39:47,234
I'm waiting

5983
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:49,720
and I loved it.

5984
02:39:49,720 --> 02:39:51,590
Did you talk to assholes?

5985
02:39:51,620 --> 02:39:51,861
Yeah,

5986
02:39:51,861 --> 02:39:52,341
we loved it.

5987
02:39:52,341 --> 02:39:52,911
It was amazing.

5988
02:39:52,911 --> 02:39:53,550
I loved it.

5989
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:54,383
Loved it.

5990
02:39:54,830 --> 02:39:55,510
Game changing.

5991
02:39:55,510 --> 02:39:56,750
Share with a cliche.

5992
02:39:56,800 --> 02:39:56,941
Well,

5993
02:39:56,941 --> 02:39:58,370
it's the hottest.

5994
02:39:58,440 --> 02:39:59,860
It's Pocahontas from Delhi.

5995
02:39:59,861 --> 02:40:00,950
Amazing Stat too.

5996
02:40:00,951 --> 02:40:01,350
It's,

5997
02:40:01,350 --> 02:40:01,570
it's,

5998
02:40:01,570 --> 02:40:01,790
well,

5999
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:02,210
you know,

6000
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:06,110
there's only so many fucking real
archetypal stories of heroes.

6001
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:08,181
Vito Belfort,

6002
02:40:08,181 --> 02:40:09,080
Kelvin gasoline.

6003
02:40:10,190 --> 02:40:11,360
Here's my take on this.

6004
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:15,900
I think Calvin's gas is
fucking hugely superior,

6005
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:18,840
but if [inaudible] can swarm
him in the first round,

6006
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:23,010
he's been known to be able to put anybody
on Queer Street one round to get it

6007
02:40:23,011 --> 02:40:23,250
done.

6008
02:40:23,250 --> 02:40:24,150
But I'm telling you,

6009
02:40:24,151 --> 02:40:27,930
Kelvin Gaslamp takes a punch about as
good as any fucking human being alive.

6010
02:40:28,590 --> 02:40:28,980
His,

6011
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:29,890
his jaws.

6012
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:30,743
Amazing.

6013
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:32,460
He never see Calvin get hurt.

6014
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:33,001
I mean,

6015
02:40:33,001 --> 02:40:33,990
he's a tank,

6016
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:37,770
he's an excellent wrestler
and he knows how to win man.

6017
02:40:37,790 --> 02:40:41,580
He know how he went to win on the ultimate
fighter when nobody sort of thought

6018
02:40:41,581 --> 02:40:42,810
that he was going to be winning that show.

6019
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,340
Everybody's looking to Uriah Hall.

6020
02:40:44,700 --> 02:40:45,780
He tuned up.

6021
02:40:45,781 --> 02:40:46,800
Can't Tim Kennedy,

6022
02:40:46,801 --> 02:40:48,390
I mean he tuned him up,

6023
02:40:48,391 --> 02:40:49,224
man.

6024
02:40:49,650 --> 02:40:50,483
That was,

6025
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:51,260
yeah,

6026
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:54,060
he's saying file insane fight.

6027
02:40:54,750 --> 02:40:56,730
Tim is making it safe for democracy so,

6028
02:40:57,060 --> 02:40:57,450
well,

6029
02:40:57,450 --> 02:40:58,081
you know what it is?

6030
02:40:58,081 --> 02:41:03,081
Tim trained for two different fights
and went through two camps and a,

6031
02:41:04,561 --> 02:41:08,340
I think he was really overtrained and
he looked like he wasn't recovering well

6032
02:41:08,341 --> 02:41:09,174
in that fight.

6033
02:41:09,180 --> 02:41:10,950
That's what has a lot of other options,

6034
02:41:10,980 --> 02:41:11,251
you know,

6035
02:41:11,251 --> 02:41:12,150
and he's kind of half in,

6036
02:41:12,151 --> 02:41:14,220
half out maybe.

6037
02:41:14,250 --> 02:41:15,540
But I don't think that's what did it,

6038
02:41:15,541 --> 02:41:15,781
man.

6039
02:41:15,781 --> 02:41:16,320
I think we did.

6040
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:18,720
A man is his cardio and
he's known for his cardio.

6041
02:41:18,721 --> 02:41:19,650
So I think what happened,

6042
02:41:19,690 --> 02:41:20,510
he cut,

6043
02:41:20,510 --> 02:41:23,540
not even think it's the weight cut as
much as it's overtraining and all us,

6044
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:25,710
his training partners think
that it's overtraining,

6045
02:41:26,130 --> 02:41:27,540
but it's also Calvin gas alum.

6046
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:31,110
I mean Calvin might've got him even if
he had everything going for him because

6047
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:33,210
Tim is like a thick,

6048
02:41:33,270 --> 02:41:34,200
solid,

6049
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:36,360
super strong grappler,

6050
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:38,430
but kind of plotting on the feet,

6051
02:41:38,730 --> 02:41:39,061
you know,

6052
02:41:39,061 --> 02:41:42,180
he doesn't throw anything
with lightning fast precision.

6053
02:41:42,390 --> 02:41:43,500
But Calvin,

6054
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:46,650
the punches come like
lightening man and they,

6055
02:41:46,830 --> 02:41:47,310
and he does,

6056
02:41:47,310 --> 02:41:49,020
he doesn't load up on his punches.

6057
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:54,080
He's constantly moving and constantly
moving in and out with his foot work.

6058
02:41:54,590 --> 02:41:55,500
But he's getting a lot,

6059
02:41:55,501 --> 02:41:56,850
but he's getting better fast.

6060
02:41:57,130 --> 02:42:00,040
When you see improvements
fight after fight I was,

6061
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:03,810
I was never really on the Kelvin train
and then after that one I was like,

6062
02:42:03,811 --> 02:42:04,920
God damn you going to be trouble.

6063
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:09,130
Especially at 85 I think the top five
is going to be a real challenge for him.

6064
02:42:09,131 --> 02:42:13,350
But outside that he's a monster to do
when they show the TRT v I was going to

6065
02:42:13,351 --> 02:42:15,120
send him on.

6066
02:42:15,121 --> 02:42:18,000
Trt is literally so night and day.

6067
02:42:18,001 --> 02:42:18,780
It's ridiculous.

6068
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:19,411
It's insane.

6069
02:42:19,411 --> 02:42:20,244
So scary.

6070
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:23,310
But he knocked out Dan Henderson
and I fight the last one.

6071
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:24,660
There was no TRT.

6072
02:42:26,570 --> 02:42:28,000
Chris had been kind of,

6073
02:42:28,050 --> 02:42:28,883
that was about,

6074
02:42:29,310 --> 02:42:29,550
well,

6075
02:42:29,550 --> 02:42:30,420
how about more saucy?

6076
02:42:30,421 --> 02:42:31,960
We saucy beat the fuck out of them.

6077
02:42:31,970 --> 02:42:32,803
Takes off.

6078
02:42:32,890 --> 02:42:34,620
[inaudible] went through the first round,

6079
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:35,610
survived the storm,

6080
02:42:35,611 --> 02:42:36,540
said what he was gonna do.

6081
02:42:36,541 --> 02:42:36,811
He said,

6082
02:42:36,811 --> 02:42:39,030
I'm going to take him in the first
round and I'm going to knock them out.

6083
02:42:40,090 --> 02:42:41,370
And as he took them
out of the first round,

6084
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:42,480
he took him into the second,

6085
02:42:43,180 --> 02:42:45,090
took them into the second
and just wore his ass out.

6086
02:42:45,450 --> 02:42:46,680
Vito just can't sustain.

6087
02:42:46,681 --> 02:42:47,514
Look at Victor.

6088
02:42:48,150 --> 02:42:49,260
That's cal Calvin,

6089
02:42:49,261 --> 02:42:50,400
the no victor.

6090
02:42:50,430 --> 02:42:50,980
I'm sorry.

6091
02:42:50,980 --> 02:42:52,020
Sophie tournament master.

6092
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:57,630
I'll tell you why I like Kelvin with
his confidence and he had zero fear.

6093
02:42:57,930 --> 02:42:58,380
Yes.

6094
02:42:58,380 --> 02:43:01,680
One of the nicest guys on
the planet and well spoken.

6095
02:43:01,740 --> 02:43:04,710
No fear of hurting and enjoys marijuana.

6096
02:43:04,711 --> 02:43:05,544
Is that true?

6097
02:43:05,890 --> 02:43:06,723
I'm not.

6098
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:10,590
It's no need to discuss this further,

6099
02:43:10,591 --> 02:43:11,140
Huh?

6100
02:43:11,140 --> 02:43:11,361
Good.

6101
02:43:11,361 --> 02:43:11,680
Hey guys,

6102
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:12,220
like natural

6103
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:13,053
medicines.

6104
02:43:13,110 --> 02:43:13,900
That's important.

6105
02:43:13,900 --> 02:43:14,733
That's big time.

6106
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:17,710
But in pink he does like natural medicine.

6107
02:43:17,711 --> 02:43:18,544
I'm a big fan.

6108
02:43:19,990 --> 02:43:20,560
Big Fan.

6109
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:22,300
Look at victor dancing in the background.

6110
02:43:22,301 --> 02:43:23,134
Who is victor?

6111
02:43:23,250 --> 02:43:25,900
Victor Davila that he's
one of the 10th planet.

6112
02:43:25,901 --> 02:43:26,460
Blackbelt Huh?

6113
02:43:26,460 --> 02:43:27,040
Okay.

6114
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:30,190
Cause he trails Ebi and he does the um,

6115
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:30,640
the,

6116
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:32,710
my job for the UFC in Spanish.

6117
02:43:33,130 --> 02:43:33,251
Hey,

6118
02:43:33,251 --> 02:43:34,800
let him have this slide off.

6119
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:35,770
Do they?

6120
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:36,550
Well that's cool.

6121
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:37,270
Beautiful.

6122
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:41,910
So he could do this and then he trains
out of kings to fulltime now Keller,

6123
02:43:42,710 --> 02:43:44,490
he doesn't have a song
in his head over there.

6124
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:45,641
He lives in,

6125
02:43:45,641 --> 02:43:46,720
he lives with master event.

6126
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:48,970
They live together like best friends now.

6127
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:49,863
Oh Shit.

6128
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:51,183
Wow.

6129
02:43:51,580 --> 02:43:53,330
Where did the adult not specific to beach.

6130
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:54,453
Okay.

6131
02:43:54,820 --> 02:43:56,590
That's a good spot for if
you're going to be a fighter.

6132
02:43:56,660 --> 02:43:56,870
Yeah.

6133
02:43:56,870 --> 02:43:58,480
Something about Orange County man.

6134
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:00,430
Especially down the beach area.

6135
02:44:00,431 --> 02:44:01,690
Like Huntington beach in particular.

6136
02:44:01,690 --> 02:44:01,871
Man,

6137
02:44:01,871 --> 02:44:02,710
there's a lot of great gems,

6138
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:04,810
especially Jitsu.

6139
02:44:04,900 --> 02:44:06,550
There's just all sorts of things going on.

6140
02:44:06,770 --> 02:44:08,170
Well La in particular,

6141
02:44:08,171 --> 02:44:08,471
Matt,

6142
02:44:08,471 --> 02:44:09,910
I mean is there another place?

6143
02:44:09,911 --> 02:44:11,560
It's more of a hotbed for martial arts,

6144
02:44:11,561 --> 02:44:15,140
like on the level that this place
is like New York and La are the two,

6145
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:17,680
I'd Say New York and Florida.

6146
02:44:17,890 --> 02:44:18,723
Florida's giant.

6147
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:19,631
The what?

6148
02:44:19,631 --> 02:44:22,540
What la doesn't have is it doesn't
have like an American top team.

6149
02:44:22,541 --> 02:44:27,541
We have like a one wealthy guy who funds
this gigantic organization on La North.

6150
02:44:28,690 --> 02:44:32,220
Northern Cali does though with
a k and then team Alpha Man.

6151
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:32,980
Yeah,

6152
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:33,520
yeah,

6153
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:34,300
for sure.

6154
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:35,111
But Dan Lambert,

6155
02:44:35,111 --> 02:44:36,760
what he's done down there
in southern Florida,

6156
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:38,260
something special.

6157
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:43,260
It is mixing around for over to Dan
Lambert conflict down there and dumped a

6158
02:44:43,671 --> 02:44:44,021
lot.

6159
02:44:44,021 --> 02:44:45,940
Oh cash into that a lot.

6160
02:44:45,941 --> 02:44:48,280
Oh cash smart guy.

6161
02:44:48,281 --> 02:44:49,690
Man Loves MMA.

6162
02:44:50,170 --> 02:44:50,800
Loves it.

6163
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:51,633
And then he was like,

6164
02:44:51,700 --> 02:44:52,180
he's what?

6165
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:55,180
You would really want a
knowledgeable guy for sure.

6166
02:44:55,181 --> 02:44:56,030
Pull that crack up.

6167
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:57,600
A little booty crack.

6168
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:00,340
They're distracted by his legs.

6169
02:45:00,460 --> 02:45:01,000
Pull it up.

6170
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:01,241
Ooh.

6171
02:45:01,241 --> 02:45:02,074
Powerful.

6172
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:04,300
All cell phone stuff to you guys.

6173
02:45:04,301 --> 02:45:06,370
This is new stuff.

6174
02:45:06,610 --> 02:45:07,840
Every fight he's got something new.

6175
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:10,480
Who's this television
don't spinning kicks.

6176
02:45:10,481 --> 02:45:11,710
Throwing crazy shit on the ground.

6177
02:45:11,711 --> 02:45:12,544
On the ground.

6178
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:13,390
He's,

6179
02:45:13,390 --> 02:45:14,730
he's 10 clinic guy too.

6180
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:15,670
He got some brown belt.

6181
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:16,510
Nice.

6182
02:45:16,510 --> 02:45:16,701
Well,

6183
02:45:16,701 --> 02:45:19,660
Calvin has a really impressed the
shit out of me to his footwork.

6184
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:22,360
His movement like is so
light on his feet narrow.

6185
02:45:22,480 --> 02:45:24,280
He leaps in and pop side Jab.

6186
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:25,250
Oh,

6187
02:45:25,250 --> 02:45:26,800
we turned the straight left.

6188
02:45:26,890 --> 02:45:27,980
He turns looking good and bad.

6189
02:45:27,990 --> 02:45:31,330
Kelvin and Tony First and I'll
have that same kind of mentality.

6190
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:33,980
Just that fricking know fear.

6191
02:45:34,010 --> 02:45:36,190
Mexican walls have fun.

6192
02:45:37,650 --> 02:45:40,150
Have Fun in the [inaudible]
if they want to be in there.

6193
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:40,640
Yeah.

6194
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:41,473
Oh they love it.

6195
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:43,810
They love what percentage
of Mexican is Tony Ferguson?

6196
02:45:44,380 --> 02:45:47,920
Hundred percent he's 100% but the
last name is Ferguson and his Stepdad.

6197
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:52,120
Ah.

6198
02:45:55,340 --> 02:45:56,173
Oh Wow.

6199
02:45:56,610 --> 02:45:57,920
A little bit of white flavor on them.

6200
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:00,830
I'm liking the way I Mike and
the look and features eyes.

6201
02:46:00,890 --> 02:46:03,320
I'm liking the creasing in his neck.

6202
02:46:03,321 --> 02:46:06,710
I'm feeling like he's coming
in with more than dad bod.

6203
02:46:06,740 --> 02:46:07,580
That's all I'm gonna say.

6204
02:46:07,910 --> 02:46:08,151
Well,

6205
02:46:08,151 --> 02:46:09,380
you had dad bought of the in,

6206
02:46:09,381 --> 02:46:10,220
how would that be possible?

6207
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:10,550
Okay.

6208
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:12,230
Didn't see the way and
didn't see the way in,

6209
02:46:12,231 --> 02:46:13,400
but there was only 24 hours,

6210
02:46:13,401 --> 02:46:15,050
but sir didn't see it.

6211
02:46:15,410 --> 02:46:18,440
Just saying talking because a lot of
things can change in 24 fucking hours.

6212
02:46:18,441 --> 02:46:20,300
That's what I'm trying to
tell me about rehydration.

6213
02:46:20,301 --> 02:46:20,691
The body,

6214
02:46:20,691 --> 02:46:21,710
while he looks intense.

6215
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:22,071
Yeah,

6216
02:46:22,071 --> 02:46:23,280
he does look fucking into,

6217
02:46:23,400 --> 02:46:26,930
this is my point for the less strong jaw.

6218
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:28,461
Haven't seen his job.

6219
02:46:28,461 --> 02:46:30,110
That look that strong
and a long time told him,

6220
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:30,973
man,

6221
02:46:31,640 --> 02:46:32,473
why don't you marry him?

6222
02:46:32,510 --> 02:46:33,660
You guys don't know what happened.

6223
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:36,260
No idea.

6224
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:37,010
Have no idea.

6225
02:46:37,010 --> 02:46:38,450
I don't know Twitter.

6226
02:46:38,510 --> 02:46:39,710
I do not know I post it.

6227
02:46:39,711 --> 02:46:40,370
I'm not telling me.

6228
02:46:40,370 --> 02:46:41,540
I'm so proud of myself.

6229
02:46:41,541 --> 02:46:44,480
This is the first time I've ever watched
a fight card without having any idea

6230
02:46:44,481 --> 02:46:47,120
what was going to happen in any of the
fights because there was no more a box

6231
02:46:47,121 --> 02:46:47,660
boxing on.

6232
02:46:47,660 --> 02:46:48,770
He didn't look back yesterday.

6233
02:46:48,980 --> 02:46:49,311
By the way.

6234
02:46:49,311 --> 02:46:50,180
That's more than dad bod,

6235
02:46:50,181 --> 02:46:50,600
dude.

6236
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:52,270
It definitely looks better
than he looked against.

6237
02:46:52,280 --> 02:46:52,790
He does.

6238
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:53,331
He looks absolutely.

6239
02:46:53,331 --> 02:46:54,164
It's better than he looks.

6240
02:46:54,580 --> 02:46:55,910
More aerodynamic.

6241
02:46:55,911 --> 02:46:57,200
Way more aerodynamic.

6242
02:46:57,400 --> 02:46:57,650
Yeah,

6243
02:46:57,650 --> 02:46:57,951
Dude,

6244
02:46:57,951 --> 02:46:58,641
look at him right there.

6245
02:46:58,641 --> 02:46:59,720
That definitely looks better.

6246
02:46:59,730 --> 02:47:00,800
Like this right here,

6247
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:02,180
we're seeing a rehydrated.

6248
02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:05,240
He looks better than he looked at what
he does when he went into the room

6249
02:47:05,241 --> 02:47:07,100
against Weidman into the octagon,

6250
02:47:07,101 --> 02:47:10,130
rather like you could see his loose skin
jiggling around while I was jumping up

6251
02:47:10,131 --> 02:47:10,381
around.

6252
02:47:10,381 --> 02:47:10,581
Yeah,

6253
02:47:10,581 --> 02:47:11,450
that was rough.

6254
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:11,900
Yeah.

6255
02:47:11,900 --> 02:47:12,381
Come on man.

6256
02:47:12,381 --> 02:47:12,831
Let's go.

6257
02:47:12,831 --> 02:47:13,730
He looks not bad there.

6258
02:47:13,731 --> 02:47:14,491
It looks aggressive.

6259
02:47:14,491 --> 02:47:16,490
You should take a powerful older man.

6260
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:17,110
Hey,

6261
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:17,410
well wait.

6262
02:47:17,410 --> 02:47:18,243
That's what he is.

6263
02:47:18,290 --> 02:47:19,790
Whereas when he was on TRT,

6264
02:47:19,791 --> 02:47:24,350
he looked like a science project
because that's what he was.

6265
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:29,720
He's a fucking side.

6266
02:47:30,070 --> 02:47:30,801
How old is he now?

6267
02:47:30,801 --> 02:47:35,750
38 he's 39 or 49 he's been fighting
for 20 years past some of that sweet,

6268
02:47:35,751 --> 02:47:36,560
sweet wine this way.

6269
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,190
Sorry Buddy.

6270
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:38,023
I've been

6271
02:47:39,170 --> 02:47:40,220
natural medicines.

6272
02:47:40,450 --> 02:47:40,590
Oh,

6273
02:47:40,590 --> 02:47:41,423
I got some of that.

6274
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:43,670
I've got a blanket Betty.

6275
02:47:43,671 --> 02:47:44,480
A little more.

6276
02:47:44,480 --> 02:47:44,841
Jamie.

6277
02:47:44,841 --> 02:47:45,810
Remind me to bring

6278
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:48,920
a couple of guys hanging out.

6279
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:49,933
That's true.

6280
02:47:51,170 --> 02:47:52,010
I'm not doing nothing.

6281
02:47:55,150 --> 02:47:56,080
I won't present cause

6282
02:47:57,740 --> 02:47:58,573
I got you.

6283
02:47:59,150 --> 02:48:01,520
Let's definitely not talk over each
other and definitely not give any

6284
02:48:03,710 --> 02:48:04,431
smart man.

6285
02:48:04,431 --> 02:48:05,264
He's smart.

6286
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:06,800
He's smart.

6287
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:07,191
He's smart.

6288
02:48:07,191 --> 02:48:07,491
He's my,

6289
02:48:07,491 --> 02:48:07,911
here we go,

6290
02:48:07,911 --> 02:48:08,241
folks.

6291
02:48:08,241 --> 02:48:09,074
Here we go.

6292
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:11,150
Vito Belfort fucked.

6293
02:48:11,151 --> 02:48:11,984
Yeah.

6294
02:48:12,670 --> 02:48:13,050
Joanie,

6295
02:48:13,050 --> 02:48:13,883
flip through.

6296
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:14,621
No,

6297
02:48:14,621 --> 02:48:14,711
no,

6298
02:48:14,711 --> 02:48:15,040
no,

6299
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:15,590
nope.

6300
02:48:15,590 --> 02:48:16,910
I'm giving him an inch a wine.

6301
02:48:16,970 --> 02:48:17,181
Ah,

6302
02:48:17,181 --> 02:48:18,200
you such a Nazi.

6303
02:48:18,201 --> 02:48:19,034
You fucking,

6304
02:48:19,470 --> 02:48:20,303
he knows.

6305
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:22,260
Eddie knows he doesn't want to go crazy.

6306
02:48:22,261 --> 02:48:22,960
Eat Pizza Gate.

6307
02:48:22,960 --> 02:48:23,480
All right.

6308
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:24,440
He doesn't want to do it on

6309
02:48:27,610 --> 02:48:28,443
the path.

6310
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:30,740
What I'm saying here we go,

6311
02:48:30,980 --> 02:48:31,850
main event folks.

6312
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:34,400
It's just kids.

6313
02:48:34,401 --> 02:48:35,234
Who cares.

6314
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:37,040
Just drive me to the comedy store.

6315
02:48:37,041 --> 02:48:38,660
You know that right am
I don't have my car.

6316
02:48:38,790 --> 02:48:39,623
All right.

6317
02:48:39,910 --> 02:48:41,350
That'll put your feet up on my car.

6318
02:48:41,360 --> 02:48:42,990
And when the pound your Dick and

6319
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:45,181
why don't you have your car,

6320
02:48:45,181 --> 02:48:46,014
Brian?

6321
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:46,730
Uh,

6322
02:48:46,730 --> 02:48:47,510
well,

6323
02:48:47,510 --> 02:48:49,300
I didn't know we were
doing the podcasts at for,

6324
02:48:49,510 --> 02:48:49,790
no,

6325
02:48:49,790 --> 02:48:50,271
I called him.

6326
02:48:50,271 --> 02:48:54,210
I just don't want you to be talking
with today's whatever five really posted

6327
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:55,063
this morning.

6328
02:48:55,580 --> 02:48:56,413
Whatever

6329
02:48:57,800 --> 02:48:58,633
pictures

6330
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:01,520
you call him on my kid.

6331
02:49:02,250 --> 02:49:04,550
I don't think I've ever liked the picture.

6332
02:49:04,850 --> 02:49:05,001
Well,

6333
02:49:05,001 --> 02:49:05,740
that's not good.

6334
02:49:05,740 --> 02:49:07,740
That's why people are
gonna like years now.

6335
02:49:07,890 --> 02:49:08,050
I

6336
02:49:08,050 --> 02:49:08,330
don't know.

6337
02:49:08,330 --> 02:49:09,870
Not don't mean it in a personal way.

6338
02:49:09,890 --> 02:49:11,130
It was just bad on social media.

6339
02:49:11,131 --> 02:49:12,470
I just don't read a lot of,

6340
02:49:13,080 --> 02:49:13,980
that's probably good too.

6341
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:14,913
Yeah.

6342
02:49:15,150 --> 02:49:15,750
Damn.

6343
02:49:15,750 --> 02:49:16,800
Kelvinn looks so calm.

6344
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:19,960
It was cool to Rafael Cordeiro Cole.

6345
02:49:19,990 --> 02:49:20,823
He's the best,

6346
02:49:21,620 --> 02:49:22,400
nicest guy.

6347
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:23,233
Oh Man,

6348
02:49:24,150 --> 02:49:24,750
I love that guy.

6349
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:25,310
I love it when it,

6350
02:49:25,310 --> 02:49:27,230
when guys that are involved in the sports,

6351
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:31,950
such a violent sport can
be like sweetheart dicks
because they'd been humbled.

6352
02:49:31,951 --> 02:49:34,650
Like everybody who's really gotten
in the sport has been knocked out.

6353
02:49:34,670 --> 02:49:35,503
It's been humbled.

6354
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:36,743
You know what I mean?

6355
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:37,960
Possible to be cocked.

6356
02:49:37,961 --> 02:49:38,491
Rufus,

6357
02:49:38,491 --> 02:49:39,330
super cool.

6358
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:40,010
The nicest,

6359
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:40,830
nicest guy.

6360
02:49:40,830 --> 02:49:44,130
Conor McGregor is cocky as he
seems when he loses or wins.

6361
02:49:44,131 --> 02:49:45,300
He's always gracious.

6362
02:49:45,730 --> 02:49:46,260
Brian.

6363
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:49,230
I met him for the first time
last weekend and Cody Garbrandt,

6364
02:49:49,320 --> 02:49:50,153
Cody,

6365
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:51,330
Cody,

6366
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:52,163
I'm sorry.

6367
02:49:53,100 --> 02:49:54,030
I don't know a Gary.

6368
02:49:54,150 --> 02:49:55,350
Super Nice Guy as well.

6369
02:49:56,720 --> 02:49:57,570
After he did that,

6370
02:49:57,571 --> 02:49:58,710
he had that kid with them and stuff.

6371
02:49:58,710 --> 02:49:59,810
That guy can do no wrong hoodie.

6372
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:04,290
Garbin your next best thumbs marketing.

6373
02:50:04,530 --> 02:50:05,151
He's awesome.

6374
02:50:05,151 --> 02:50:05,461
Vr.

6375
02:50:05,461 --> 02:50:06,180
That kid,

6376
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:07,290
he just showed us commercial,

6377
02:50:07,291 --> 02:50:07,591
but yeah,

6378
02:50:07,591 --> 02:50:08,490
he's the real deal.

6379
02:50:08,970 --> 02:50:10,140
He looks like a shit starter,

6380
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:10,861
you know what I mean?

6381
02:50:10,861 --> 02:50:12,150
But he's not super nice.

6382
02:50:12,151 --> 02:50:14,730
The skills to back it up
dressed as well speaks well.

6383
02:50:14,731 --> 02:50:15,481
World champion,

6384
02:50:15,481 --> 02:50:15,991
last beat,

6385
02:50:15,991 --> 02:50:16,824
Dominick Cruz.

6386
02:50:16,830 --> 02:50:17,011
I know.

6387
02:50:17,011 --> 02:50:18,000
It's interesting when you see him,

6388
02:50:18,001 --> 02:50:20,340
when that full suit and you
see all the neck tattoos,

6389
02:50:20,341 --> 02:50:20,670
you're like,

6390
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:20,880
Ooh,

6391
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:22,320
this is interesting what he's doing here.

6392
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:24,480
He's like polishing up a murderer.

6393
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:27,930
He's when he's inside that octagon.

6394
02:50:27,931 --> 02:50:29,810
Did he use pit bulls?

6395
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:30,653
Toenails

6396
02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:32,940
fans in Brazil?

6397
02:50:32,941 --> 02:50:33,650
Huh?

6398
02:50:33,650 --> 02:50:35,430
So hard looking man man.

6399
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:36,720
Oh they go crazy for him.

6400
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:37,810
Here we go.

6401
02:50:37,810 --> 02:50:39,990
I'll look at that.

6402
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:41,370
Calvin looks so calm.

6403
02:50:41,970 --> 02:50:43,530
No one is more calm in there.

6404
02:50:43,570 --> 02:50:44,060
Nobody.

6405
02:50:44,060 --> 02:50:44,893
Calvin.

6406
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:47,550
Part of the reason is cause
he takes such a good shot.

6407
02:50:48,060 --> 02:50:51,030
I mean obviously he's really good
and he's just confident period.

6408
02:50:51,031 --> 02:50:55,740
But Calvin's got that Chin is
fucking iron that has to help you.

6409
02:50:55,780 --> 02:50:56,613
Right?

6410
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:58,860
Cause you know you can make a
little mistake and still get away.

6411
02:50:59,310 --> 02:50:59,760
Get Away with.

6412
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:00,960
That's chuck in his prime.

6413
02:51:00,961 --> 02:51:01,771
And Chuck's prime,

6414
02:51:01,771 --> 02:51:03,660
one of his biggest assets was his chin.

6415
02:51:04,650 --> 02:51:05,640
Chin was phenomenal.

6416
02:51:05,900 --> 02:51:06,510
Man.

6417
02:51:06,510 --> 02:51:09,150
See now watch how good
Calvin moves on his feet.

6418
02:51:09,480 --> 02:51:11,400
He's real light is in and out.

6419
02:51:11,401 --> 02:51:12,780
So count like much distance.

6420
02:51:12,781 --> 02:51:14,520
He covers forward and back.

6421
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:16,350
Just to let you know
he's nowhere near you.

6422
02:51:16,500 --> 02:51:17,380
He's Kinda close.

6423
02:51:17,480 --> 02:51:17,940
Changed.

6424
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:18,900
He's nowhere near you.

6425
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:19,231
Oh,

6426
02:51:19,231 --> 02:51:20,041
you could switch it up,

6427
02:51:20,041 --> 02:51:20,874
man.

6428
02:51:21,030 --> 02:51:21,863
It's a pain in the ass.

6429
02:51:22,840 --> 02:51:24,540
As Unorthodox as possible.

6430
02:51:24,541 --> 02:51:25,200
He's into that.

6431
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:27,510
It's important because from
the South Pole position,

6432
02:51:27,511 --> 02:51:29,010
he shuts down that high kick.

6433
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:30,660
It's much harder for me.

6434
02:51:30,661 --> 02:51:30,870
So,

6435
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:32,820
so Victoria has to kick off of that left,

6436
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:33,571
or excuse me,

6437
02:51:33,571 --> 02:51:34,380
off the right.

6438
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:35,810
That was a little snap kick to the,

6439
02:51:35,880 --> 02:51:36,713
to the chin.

6440
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:37,891
Nice short,

6441
02:51:37,891 --> 02:51:38,724
sweet door.

6442
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:40,080
It's going old school,

6443
02:51:40,110 --> 02:51:40,381
man.

6444
02:51:40,381 --> 02:51:41,550
I'm not mad at it.

6445
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:43,160
Oh,

6446
02:51:43,270 --> 02:51:44,180
most wheel kick.

6447
02:51:44,190 --> 02:51:45,210
Don't get caught with [inaudible].

6448
02:51:45,310 --> 02:51:46,143
Everybody calmed down.

6449
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:48,930
He's got some hands.

6450
02:51:49,470 --> 02:51:50,430
He's still got the speed.

6451
02:51:50,431 --> 02:51:53,190
Speed doesn't go in your 38
40 when you're veto our guys.

6452
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:54,250
Is He?

6453
02:51:54,250 --> 02:51:55,083
Oh

6454
02:51:56,810 --> 02:51:57,290
Shit.

6455
02:51:57,290 --> 02:51:59,730
The just feeling very explosively shit.

6456
02:51:59,940 --> 02:52:00,773
Oh my God.

6457
02:52:00,830 --> 02:52:03,300
Towards fastest posts still.

6458
02:52:03,360 --> 02:52:03,740
And he's,

6459
02:52:03,740 --> 02:52:04,620
he's always moved.

6460
02:52:04,621 --> 02:52:05,080
Amazing.

6461
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:05,380
I mean,

6462
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:07,030
Peter's House about his prose.

6463
02:52:07,210 --> 02:52:08,043
Kelby,

6464
02:52:09,460 --> 02:52:13,600
he can't do this for
every round five rounds.

6465
02:52:13,601 --> 02:52:13,840
Yes.

6466
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:14,381
Five minutes.

6467
02:52:14,381 --> 02:52:14,690
A few.

6468
02:52:14,690 --> 02:52:15,070
Yeah.

6469
02:52:15,070 --> 02:52:16,600
This is a five round main event.

6470
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:17,260
Oh,

6471
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:18,180
he's talking Hazel.

6472
02:52:19,390 --> 02:52:20,680
Oh,

6473
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:22,630
tell me I clipped they're a little bit,

6474
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:23,321
I love the way Kevin,

6475
02:52:23,321 --> 02:52:24,154
I'm raises his hand.

6476
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:24,790
I'm like,

6477
02:52:24,790 --> 02:52:25,121
dude,

6478
02:52:25,121 --> 02:52:25,954
I'm telling you man,

6479
02:52:26,110 --> 02:52:26,561
Calvin,

6480
02:52:26,561 --> 02:52:27,040
we'll start.

6481
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:27,280
Ooh,

6482
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:29,130
good kick to the body there by V tour.

6483
02:52:31,990 --> 02:52:32,823
Oh,

6484
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:34,593
yikes.

6485
02:52:34,690 --> 02:52:37,720
Kevin would be able to pour it on with
vittores starts to wilt and that's what

6486
02:52:37,721 --> 02:52:41,080
it's going to get interesting with
Kelvin to try and grapple to at all.

6487
02:52:42,430 --> 02:52:45,010
And the thinking about tore
too is he's never really,

6488
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:47,080
except for the rumble fight,

6489
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:47,741
the role fight.

6490
02:52:47,741 --> 02:52:49,390
He actually did come back from behind.

6491
02:52:49,630 --> 02:52:49,851
Right.

6492
02:52:49,851 --> 02:52:50,830
And he was losing that fight.

6493
02:52:50,850 --> 02:52:51,110
Yeah.

6494
02:52:51,110 --> 02:52:51,711
Oh Geez.

6495
02:52:51,711 --> 02:52:52,690
Easy with those knees.

6496
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:53,440
He was losing it.

6497
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:54,273
Oh.

6498
02:52:55,450 --> 02:52:56,081
Oh,

6499
02:52:56,081 --> 02:52:56,590
he's hurt.

6500
02:52:56,590 --> 02:52:57,530
That's straight heartland.

6501
02:52:57,540 --> 02:52:58,290
It's hurt.

6502
02:52:58,290 --> 02:52:59,450
It was that right hand there.

6503
02:52:59,451 --> 02:53:00,340
That doesn't really hurt.

6504
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:02,470
His head got snapped back.

6505
02:53:02,710 --> 02:53:04,820
Glade is no hands down.

6506
02:53:05,890 --> 02:53:08,140
He throws a little straight left.

6507
02:53:08,860 --> 02:53:10,330
This Kelvin compared to Tim Kenny.

6508
02:53:10,331 --> 02:53:13,060
Kevin different animal looks even better.

6509
02:53:14,410 --> 02:53:15,420
He's so good.

6510
02:53:15,421 --> 02:53:19,330
And he's so young and he's been
lifting two to move into one 85

6511
02:53:20,940 --> 02:53:22,330
his hands are smooth man.

6512
02:53:22,510 --> 02:53:26,200
And he fires jabs like his
body can be at off angles.

6513
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:26,351
Yeah,

6514
02:53:26,351 --> 02:53:27,190
like his distance.

6515
02:53:27,191 --> 02:53:27,701
Especially.

6516
02:53:27,701 --> 02:53:29,170
He's not a long time.

6517
02:53:29,280 --> 02:53:29,590
No,

6518
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:30,190
but he used it.

6519
02:53:30,190 --> 02:53:31,480
Oh,

6520
02:53:31,481 --> 02:53:33,190
she tried to kick again.

6521
02:53:33,250 --> 02:53:34,270
Oh wait to get out of there.

6522
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:36,520
Oh Wow.

6523
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:38,340
Oh,

6524
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:38,951
oh,

6525
02:53:38,951 --> 02:53:39,970
that's over how boy.

6526
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:40,181
Oh,

6527
02:53:40,181 --> 02:53:40,840
that's over.

6528
02:53:40,840 --> 02:53:41,700
Stop the fight.

6529
02:53:41,701 --> 02:53:43,030
So hold on.

6530
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:43,410
Goddamn.

6531
02:53:43,410 --> 02:53:44,330
Who's is it Mario?

6532
02:53:44,890 --> 02:53:45,700
He's kicking up.

6533
02:53:45,700 --> 02:53:46,533
Is it Mario?

6534
02:53:47,950 --> 02:53:48,783
They could have easily.

6535
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:50,070
They could easily stop.

6536
02:53:50,540 --> 02:53:50,740
Oh,

6537
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:51,101
Kelvin,

6538
02:53:51,101 --> 02:53:52,150

6539
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:53,613
Earn this.

6540
02:53:53,820 --> 02:53:54,940
This is Brazil guys.

6541
02:53:54,970 --> 02:53:56,020
This is fucking Brazil.

6542
02:53:56,021 --> 02:53:56,531
Relax.

6543
02:53:56,531 --> 02:53:57,430
Everybody calmed down.

6544
02:53:58,690 --> 02:53:59,440
He loves her that.

6545
02:53:59,440 --> 02:53:59,741
Oh,

6546
02:53:59,741 --> 02:54:00,490
that's his shit.

6547
02:54:00,490 --> 02:54:01,480
Wrong side though.

6548
02:54:01,610 --> 02:54:01,860
It does.

6549
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,693
It does it.

6550
02:54:03,070 --> 02:54:03,903
It matters.

6551
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:05,230
It's going to be tough.

6552
02:54:06,180 --> 02:54:07,013
There's no room.

6553
02:54:07,020 --> 02:54:07,890
I'm in them out.

6554
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:09,100
You don't even need to get on the side.

6555
02:54:09,101 --> 02:54:09,611
That's old school.

6556
02:54:09,611 --> 02:54:10,690
You can't move though.

6557
02:54:10,691 --> 02:54:11,441
Eddie with the cage.

6558
02:54:11,441 --> 02:54:12,130
Right?

6559
02:54:12,130 --> 02:54:13,340
Look at before getting back.

6560
02:54:15,430 --> 02:54:16,151
Oh my God.

6561
02:54:16,151 --> 02:54:17,290
If he talked to our backup.

6562
02:54:17,320 --> 02:54:18,220
Wow.

6563
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:19,660
You got to give it up.

6564
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:20,770
He survived.

6565
02:54:20,770 --> 02:54:21,603
Kidding me.

6566
02:54:21,790 --> 02:54:21,911
Oh,

6567
02:54:21,911 --> 02:54:22,271
it's big.

6568
02:54:22,271 --> 02:54:24,790
John's the rough big John McCarthy.

6569
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:25,101
Wait,

6570
02:54:25,101 --> 02:54:25,391

6571
02:54:25,391 --> 02:54:26,170
Come on guys.

6572
02:54:26,170 --> 02:54:27,280
John made it happen.

6573
02:54:27,310 --> 02:54:28,150
Kidding me right now.

6574
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:29,270
Probably is wobbly.

6575
02:54:29,910 --> 02:54:31,360
Did throws giving it back.

6576
02:54:31,390 --> 02:54:31,600
Yeah,

6577
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:33,570
he did and a great [inaudible].

6578
02:54:33,790 --> 02:54:34,750
He's still dangerous.

6579
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:35,800
We towards still dangerous,

6580
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:37,540
but he's not on unsteady legs.

6581
02:54:37,570 --> 02:54:38,321
That's straight left.

6582
02:54:38,321 --> 02:54:39,071
Comes down the pipe.

6583
02:54:39,071 --> 02:54:39,904
That's true.

6584
02:54:40,540 --> 02:54:41,470
That contact him.

6585
02:54:41,471 --> 02:54:42,700
He tagged with that Jab.

6586
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:44,650
Jab is so crisp.

6587
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:45,513
Who's that?

6588
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:50,410
Kelvin's his pumps and nasty
and he throws that Jab,

6589
02:54:50,411 --> 02:54:51,120
right hook.

6590
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:53,830
Oh fucking hands,

6591
02:54:53,831 --> 02:54:54,664
man.

6592
02:54:55,400 --> 02:54:57,750
Oh Jeez.

6593
02:54:58,550 --> 02:55:00,580
Tell what Jews in a row.

6594
02:55:00,690 --> 02:55:01,523
He wouldn't be

6595
02:55:03,570 --> 02:55:04,930
one was barely up.

6596
02:55:06,170 --> 02:55:07,940
He covers a lot of ground with those labs.

6597
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:08,891
He comes.

6598
02:55:08,891 --> 02:55:10,760
It's weird cause you
didn't have a long reach,

6599
02:55:10,761 --> 02:55:12,400
but he keeps great distances.

6600
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:13,001
Footwork,

6601
02:55:13,001 --> 02:55:15,080
you know what is has wide as shoulders.

6602
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:17,040
I think if you measure his shoulders of,

6603
02:55:17,170 --> 02:55:17,840
okay,

6604
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:18,710
I think he's pretty.

6605
02:55:18,890 --> 02:55:19,880
Now let's talk about this.

6606
02:55:19,881 --> 02:55:23,810
Because Calvin had been talking about
going down to one 70 and you look at how

6607
02:55:23,811 --> 02:55:26,690
good he looked in Tim Kennedy fight and
then looked even fucking better against

6608
02:55:26,691 --> 02:55:31,310
Vituro standard like him at
85 stop depleting himself.

6609
02:55:31,460 --> 02:55:34,810
Said one 85 he looks like
a fucking world champion.

6610
02:55:35,050 --> 02:55:36,130
But Holy Shit,

6611
02:55:39,950 --> 02:55:44,300
look at that left good Lord.

6612
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:46,910
Bang distance.

6613
02:55:47,150 --> 02:55:48,740
Oh my goodness Joe.

6614
02:55:48,741 --> 02:55:49,220
Here's his,

6615
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:51,130
here's he.

6616
02:55:51,660 --> 02:55:52,520
He went to a what?

6617
02:55:52,521 --> 02:55:53,340
A split decision.

6618
02:55:53,340 --> 02:55:53,870
Woodley.

6619
02:55:53,870 --> 02:55:54,703
So what?

6620
02:55:54,730 --> 02:55:55,563
Boom.

6621
02:55:55,860 --> 02:55:56,060
Yeah,

6622
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:57,860
but you know why he went
to a split decision.

6623
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:01,713
Well,

6624
02:56:02,030 --> 02:56:02,741
when does that happen?

6625
02:56:02,741 --> 02:56:03,574
Who knows?

6626
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:04,433
What does that up?

6627
02:56:05,650 --> 02:56:05,900
Well,

6628
02:56:05,900 --> 02:56:07,250
two one,

6629
02:56:07,251 --> 02:56:08,084
two.

6630
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:10,040
How the first one was barely off.

6631
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:11,010
Then he adjusted,

6632
02:56:11,010 --> 02:56:14,870
adjusted like straight down
the pike at John John McCarthy.

6633
02:56:14,871 --> 02:56:15,411
Good job.

6634
02:56:15,411 --> 02:56:16,550
All the way around to yeah.

6635
02:56:16,551 --> 02:56:17,031
Good job.

6636
02:56:17,031 --> 02:56:21,440
Not Style but and John then stop and then
when it was over fucking amazing hands

6637
02:56:21,441 --> 02:56:24,680
giving big John's the
Paris fucking amazing.

6638
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:25,890
How about Calvin?

6639
02:56:25,920 --> 02:56:26,151
What a,

6640
02:56:26,151 --> 02:56:28,380
what a fucking rent him better refined.

6641
02:56:28,400 --> 02:56:29,650
Jesus Christ.

6642
02:56:29,780 --> 02:56:30,850
What do you do next with them?

6643
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:32,961
Years coach.

6644
02:56:32,961 --> 02:56:33,890
What would you do next with him?

6645
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:34,873
Title Shot.

6646
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:36,440
What can go Jesus Christ.

6647
02:56:36,441 --> 02:56:36,560
Yeah.

6648
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:37,130
You're his coach.

6649
02:56:37,130 --> 02:56:37,963
Yep.

6650
02:56:37,970 --> 02:56:39,840
What came out of shot jumps,

6651
02:56:40,540 --> 02:56:40,970
jump.

6652
02:56:40,970 --> 02:56:44,030
John [inaudible] here's the question.

6653
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:45,020
What about when question,

6654
02:56:45,080 --> 02:56:46,620
if you're making people away,

6655
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:47,700
but hold on.

6656
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:49,550
So if you're making this big GSP,

6657
02:56:49,730 --> 02:56:51,110
Michael Bisbing super fight,

6658
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:54,350
do you make Yoel Romero versus this month?

6659
02:56:54,380 --> 02:56:54,951
No.

6660
02:56:54,951 --> 02:56:55,670
No,

6661
02:56:55,670 --> 02:56:55,941
no.

6662
02:56:55,941 --> 02:56:56,600
You don't do this.

6663
02:56:56,600 --> 02:56:57,060
Yeah.

6664
02:56:57,060 --> 02:56:57,340
No,

6665
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:58,680
that's Joe and

6666
02:57:00,770 --> 02:57:03,700
Joe's got a mischievous mind
right now for the extra title

6667
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:08,990
trouble maker.

6668
02:57:09,010 --> 02:57:10,010
What do you say about that?

6669
02:57:10,040 --> 02:57:10,191
No,

6670
02:57:10,191 --> 02:57:11,620
it's too much for Kelvin.

6671
02:57:11,670 --> 02:57:14,200
We'd take the worst
matchup possible for them,

6672
02:57:14,210 --> 02:57:15,043
right?

6673
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:15,440
Yeah.

6674
02:57:15,440 --> 02:57:16,280
Not Get man.

6675
02:57:16,281 --> 02:57:16,790
Cause he,

6676
02:57:16,790 --> 02:57:17,030
you know,

6677
02:57:17,030 --> 02:57:17,920
that's an older veto.

6678
02:57:17,930 --> 02:57:18,860
Let's not get crazy.

6679
02:57:18,950 --> 02:57:19,480
He beat Tim.

6680
02:57:19,480 --> 02:57:21,710
Kenny had one foot out
Ramirez the same age,

6681
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:25,400
but y'alls you [inaudible] Victoria A.

6682
02:57:25,400 --> 02:57:26,233
Little different.

6683
02:57:26,330 --> 02:57:27,163
They're a little different.

6684
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:28,820
A little bit,

6685
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:29,690
little bit difficult.

6686
02:57:29,740 --> 02:57:31,370
That comes after one and he's good.

6687
02:57:31,371 --> 02:57:32,450
The other year we don't know.

6688
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:33,333
I'm different.

6689
02:57:33,770 --> 02:57:36,710
I would like Kelvin to fight a guy
like I think a great fight off.

6690
02:57:36,711 --> 02:57:37,750
So you'd have to beat Musashi.

6691
02:57:37,760 --> 02:57:39,240
I'd like to see why been verse Calvin.

6692
02:57:39,241 --> 02:57:40,310
I think that'd be a fun fight.

6693
02:57:41,020 --> 02:57:43,330
I don't want to top fourth three guys.

6694
02:57:43,340 --> 02:57:44,690
Not yet bill.

6695
02:57:44,691 --> 02:57:47,300
He's 25 if you use your y'all,

6696
02:57:47,301 --> 02:57:48,134
what do we do?

6697
02:57:48,520 --> 02:57:51,830
I really hope he stays at one 85
and I think he could be a champion.

6698
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:54,050
I think he's got everything
it takes to be a champion,

6699
02:57:54,051 --> 02:57:54,531
but bring them up.

6700
02:57:54,531 --> 02:57:58,250
Scalzi be who knows how the
fuck did he beat this guy?

6701
02:57:58,550 --> 02:57:59,240
How the fuck,

6702
02:57:59,240 --> 02:58:00,980
how the fuck did Michael Bisping beat him?

6703
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:02,430
Give him some time in Michael Bisping

6704
02:58:02,430 --> 02:58:06,830
beat Rockhold gimme gimme you might lose
to terracotta or he might tune rock.

6705
02:58:06,831 --> 02:58:07,800
Hold up the same way.

6706
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:08,940
Saw Him do to beat towards tonight.

6707
02:58:08,941 --> 02:58:09,774
You don't know.

6708
02:58:09,980 --> 02:58:11,580
And he's a great fighter.

6709
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:12,451
I mean that kid,

6710
02:58:12,451 --> 02:58:15,270
his movement and his accuracy
and his combinations,

6711
02:58:15,271 --> 02:58:17,640
his punches is fucking phenomenal.

6712
02:58:18,090 --> 02:58:22,590
His ability to survive on the
ground against Tim Kennedy
in that first round and

6713
02:58:22,591 --> 02:58:23,730
like virtually burned,

6714
02:58:23,731 --> 02:58:25,320
no energy came out of that,

6715
02:58:25,321 --> 02:58:28,110
survived and then started beating
the shit out of Tim and you're like,

6716
02:58:28,111 --> 02:58:28,560
well,

6717
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:30,750
maybe Tim Kennedy did really overtrain.

6718
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:32,030
Maybe he's not really preppy.

6719
02:58:32,310 --> 02:58:33,630
Look what the fuck he did tonight.

6720
02:58:33,690 --> 02:58:38,690
There's a big difference between Vitor
Belfort at 38 off TRT and the jock gray,

6721
02:58:39,630 --> 02:58:41,850
Yoel Romero and Luke Rockhold.

6722
02:58:41,851 --> 02:58:42,530
Big Difference.

6723
02:58:42,530 --> 02:58:42,961
You're right.

6724
02:58:42,961 --> 02:58:43,650
Any beaten?

6725
02:58:43,650 --> 02:58:44,041
Yes.

6726
02:58:44,041 --> 02:58:45,800
Right now we know difficult,

6727
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:46,830
but this is the next step,

6728
02:58:47,010 --> 02:58:47,843
right?

6729
02:58:48,810 --> 02:58:49,171
How's that?

6730
02:58:49,171 --> 02:58:50,010
The next step?

6731
02:58:50,011 --> 02:58:50,640
The next thing?

6732
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:52,320
I think the next logical step.

6733
02:58:52,320 --> 02:58:55,650
I feel like Calvin is top 10 top 10 yes.

6734
02:58:56,430 --> 02:58:57,001
Candy fight.

6735
02:58:57,001 --> 02:58:58,740
I think he was 10 what
was he ranked up to?

6736
02:58:58,741 --> 02:58:59,371
The Kennedy file,

6737
02:58:59,371 --> 02:59:00,390
isn't he like he don't know.

6738
02:59:00,391 --> 02:59:03,780
I think he's nine and he and he
might be 10 feet towards nine.

6739
02:59:03,810 --> 02:59:04,471
I don't pay attention.

6740
02:59:04,471 --> 02:59:05,760
So if that's the case,

6741
02:59:05,761 --> 02:59:07,740
I feel like he's in the
top six or seven now.

6742
02:59:07,741 --> 02:59:08,640
I think he's moved up.

6743
02:59:08,641 --> 02:59:08,911
Right?

6744
02:59:08,911 --> 02:59:10,380
This is a phenomenal performance.

6745
02:59:10,381 --> 02:59:11,131
He's two and Oh,

6746
02:59:11,131 --> 02:59:14,460
at middleweight he looked
amazing against and on the feet.

6747
02:59:14,461 --> 02:59:17,250
It was all in the feet against one
of the best trackers in the game.

6748
02:59:17,370 --> 02:59:18,140
Who did you go?

6749
02:59:18,140 --> 02:59:18,870
Aw,

6750
02:59:18,870 --> 02:59:23,010
when you saw vittores phase
10 Devon's 10 I bumps mail.

6751
02:59:23,011 --> 02:59:26,230
When I see a number 10 right
before this fight is Robert.

6752
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:27,650
That'd be a fun follow.

6753
02:59:27,670 --> 02:59:28,560
Jesus Christ.

6754
02:59:28,590 --> 02:59:29,260
There's a fucking,

6755
02:59:29,260 --> 02:59:31,500
Barbara Whitaker has a
barn burner coming up.

6756
02:59:31,570 --> 02:59:32,300
Chalker Ray.

6757
02:59:32,300 --> 02:59:34,200
Oh Damn.

6758
02:59:34,201 --> 02:59:34,800
That's going to be,

6759
02:59:34,800 --> 02:59:35,910
that's a fucking fight.

6760
02:59:36,030 --> 02:59:40,050
I don't think you give Calvin to
Jocko rate or any of those guys.

6761
02:59:40,380 --> 02:59:42,330
Did you know a result of this fight,

6762
02:59:42,331 --> 02:59:43,080
Eddie?

6763
02:59:43,080 --> 02:59:43,913
Yeah.

6764
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:45,300
You knew what rounded and the whole deal.

6765
02:59:45,330 --> 02:59:47,340
I didn't know what round
it was at the first round.

6766
02:59:48,200 --> 02:59:48,630
Yeah.

6767
02:59:48,630 --> 02:59:49,463
Yeah.

6768
02:59:50,990 --> 02:59:53,070
What about Derek Brunson
or Anderson Silva?

6769
02:59:54,070 --> 02:59:55,230
Mm hmm.

6770
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:55,561
Yeah.

6771
02:59:55,561 --> 02:59:56,394
That's interesting.

6772
02:59:56,430 --> 02:59:56,941
But wait a minute,

6773
02:59:56,941 --> 02:59:58,260
why this is not current?

6774
02:59:58,261 --> 02:59:59,880
It can't be because v
towards still it had,

6775
03:00:00,210 --> 03:00:00,361
well,

6776
03:00:00,361 --> 03:00:01,580
they're not going to update it tonight.

6777
03:00:01,620 --> 03:00:02,370
Right.

6778
03:00:02,370 --> 03:00:02,880
Um,

6779
03:00:02,880 --> 03:00:03,990
but the fight was yesterday.

6780
03:00:03,991 --> 03:00:05,880
I would've thought that Mike has
said probably wait till Monday.

6781
03:00:06,150 --> 03:00:06,541
But yeah,

6782
03:00:06,541 --> 03:00:06,990
look,

6783
03:00:06,990 --> 03:00:08,130
that's a crazy division.

6784
03:00:08,131 --> 03:00:08,964
Right?

6785
03:00:09,030 --> 03:00:12,300
And Derek Brunson and Anderson Silva
just getting done with their fight.

6786
03:00:12,310 --> 03:00:15,060
Robert Whittaker Brunton
makes sense out of that.

6787
03:00:16,350 --> 03:00:18,330
It's not a big name fight though for him.

6788
03:00:18,360 --> 03:00:19,193
Yeah,

6789
03:00:19,290 --> 03:00:20,730
but you got to him still a Brunton.

6790
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:22,290
Robert Whitaker has a date.

6791
03:00:22,320 --> 03:00:23,130
Messiah says date.

6792
03:00:23,130 --> 03:00:24,240
Why men's date Souza?

6793
03:00:24,250 --> 03:00:25,083
Everyone's,

6794
03:00:25,470 --> 03:00:26,930
everyone has a date for Rochel.

6795
03:00:27,810 --> 03:00:28,051
Yeah.

6796
03:00:28,051 --> 03:00:29,970
And Rockhold has been
talking about Bisping.

6797
03:00:29,971 --> 03:00:30,541
He's waiting for,

6798
03:00:30,541 --> 03:00:31,650
Bisping wants to kicked,

6799
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:33,350
put Bisbee and just be doing,

6800
03:00:33,351 --> 03:00:34,141
even have a date.

6801
03:00:34,141 --> 03:00:34,860
So what are you going to do?

6802
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:36,540
Rockhold where are they
going to do that fight?

6803
03:00:36,780 --> 03:00:37,291
They don't know.

6804
03:00:37,291 --> 03:00:37,730
Do they?

6805
03:00:37,730 --> 03:00:38,180
They have,

6806
03:00:38,180 --> 03:00:38,690
even now,

6807
03:00:38,690 --> 03:00:39,460
they may even,

6808
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:43,860
is this the first time never announced
a fight without a date or a venue or I

6809
03:00:43,861 --> 03:00:45,420
feel like it's gotta be
the 4th of July weekend,

6810
03:00:45,421 --> 03:00:46,050
right?

6811
03:00:46,050 --> 03:00:46,883
You would think,

6812
03:00:47,240 --> 03:00:47,490
yeah.

6813
03:00:47,490 --> 03:00:49,020
If you want to knock
something out of the park,

6814
03:00:49,260 --> 03:00:50,011
what does it say there?

6815
03:00:50,011 --> 03:00:51,090
Bisbing versus Saint Pierre.

6816
03:00:51,091 --> 03:00:51,960
Does it say a number?

6817
03:00:52,380 --> 03:00:55,620
You'd go look over there and that
little picture it says March 3rd press

6818
03:00:55,621 --> 03:00:56,340
conference.

6819
03:00:56,340 --> 03:00:56,491
Oh,

6820
03:00:56,491 --> 03:00:57,324
okay.

6821
03:00:57,330 --> 03:00:58,380
So they don't have a date.

6822
03:00:59,050 --> 03:01:00,010
I would imagine if we're

6823
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:02,470
looking wordy in March,

6824
03:01:02,470 --> 03:01:02,470
April,

6825
03:01:02,470 --> 03:01:02,470
May,

6826
03:01:02,470 --> 03:01:02,470
June,

6827
03:01:02,470 --> 03:01:02,471
July,

6828
03:01:02,471 --> 03:01:03,281
four months from now.

6829
03:01:03,281 --> 03:01:04,390
That's very reasonable.

6830
03:01:05,620 --> 03:01:05,951
Right?

6831
03:01:05,951 --> 03:01:06,880
There's something with GSP.

6832
03:01:06,881 --> 03:01:07,690
He didn't want to fight.

6833
03:01:07,690 --> 03:01:07,811
Well,

6834
03:01:07,811 --> 03:01:09,130
that's Sean Jones weekend too,

6835
03:01:09,131 --> 03:01:09,790
you know,

6836
03:01:09,790 --> 03:01:11,080
that's when Jon Jones returns.

6837
03:01:11,081 --> 03:01:11,914
Jon Jones,

6838
03:01:12,010 --> 03:01:12,120
I,

6839
03:01:12,120 --> 03:01:13,370
Anthony Johnson and John Jones.

6840
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:15,673
Oh.

6841
03:01:17,810 --> 03:01:18,643
Oh Jesus.

6842
03:01:19,010 --> 03:01:20,060
Oh Jesus.

6843
03:01:20,230 --> 03:01:25,230
That's going to be Jon Jones coming back
and joy that one on the undercard of

6844
03:01:25,871 --> 03:01:27,220
Bisbing versus GSP.

6845
03:01:27,250 --> 03:01:27,941
Holy Shit.

6846
03:01:27,941 --> 03:01:28,450
What a card.

6847
03:01:28,450 --> 03:01:29,283
Oh boy.

6848
03:01:30,070 --> 03:01:30,870
What a card,

6849
03:01:30,870 --> 03:01:31,150
dude.

6850
03:01:31,150 --> 03:01:31,420
Hey,

6851
03:01:31,420 --> 03:01:31,691
what?

6852
03:01:31,691 --> 03:01:32,261
Eddie Bravo.

6853
03:01:32,261 --> 03:01:34,900
What happened with you and
Michael Bisping on that?

6854
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:38,740
We heard that there was this
crazy argument and there's
a video of you guys talk

6855
03:01:38,741 --> 03:01:38,861
about,

6856
03:01:38,861 --> 03:01:40,150
it seems like you're working it out.

6857
03:01:41,070 --> 03:01:41,980
He's my friend.

6858
03:01:41,981 --> 03:01:42,311
It's like,

6859
03:01:42,311 --> 03:01:42,521
you know,

6860
03:01:42,521 --> 03:01:43,810
when you're arguing with your friends,

6861
03:01:43,811 --> 03:01:44,470
there's like,

6862
03:01:44,470 --> 03:01:44,891
people are like,

6863
03:01:44,891 --> 03:01:45,090
oh,

6864
03:01:45,090 --> 03:01:45,940
what are they going to fight?

6865
03:01:46,030 --> 03:01:47,170
Not For one second.

6866
03:01:47,620 --> 03:01:48,760
Did I think a fight?

6867
03:01:48,761 --> 03:01:49,600
What's going to go down?

6868
03:01:50,110 --> 03:01:50,681
You know?

6869
03:01:50,681 --> 03:01:50,950
Um,

6870
03:01:50,950 --> 03:01:51,161
you know,

6871
03:01:51,161 --> 03:01:51,994
every time I,

6872
03:01:52,540 --> 03:01:53,170
I,

6873
03:01:53,170 --> 03:01:53,590
you know,

6874
03:01:53,590 --> 03:01:55,930
talk about Mike Bisbing or anyone else,

6875
03:01:55,931 --> 03:01:59,470
they usually say if he visibly
improves from fight to fight,

6876
03:01:59,471 --> 03:02:00,304
you could see it.

6877
03:02:00,880 --> 03:02:01,900
And I,

6878
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:02,171
you know,

6879
03:02:02,171 --> 03:02:06,070
I'm sure he's sick of hearing that
and I was talking about that I was

6880
03:02:06,071 --> 03:02:06,904
complimenting him,

6881
03:02:07,180 --> 03:02:10,090
but then I could see how he
thought like that implied that,

6882
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:10,790
you know,

6883
03:02:10,790 --> 03:02:11,321
he was,

6884
03:02:11,321 --> 03:02:11,700
uh,

6885
03:02:11,700 --> 03:02:12,140
you know,

6886
03:02:12,140 --> 03:02:13,270
subpar at one point,

6887
03:02:13,271 --> 03:02:13,960
you know,

6888
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:14,621
so it was like,

6889
03:02:14,621 --> 03:02:16,030
I take offense to that man.

6890
03:02:16,210 --> 03:02:16,530
I,

6891
03:02:16,530 --> 03:02:18,860
I was always a bad ass ever since the,

6892
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:19,300
uh,

6893
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:21,250
the ultimate fighter show and I,

6894
03:02:21,251 --> 03:02:21,880
and I,

6895
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:22,390
I,

6896
03:02:22,390 --> 03:02:23,590
I understand where he's coming from,

6897
03:02:23,740 --> 03:02:23,981
you know,

6898
03:02:23,981 --> 03:02:27,040
so it was just a misinterpretation
of what you were describing.

6899
03:02:27,220 --> 03:02:27,381
Yeah.

6900
03:02:27,381 --> 03:02:28,570
And then we just started
talking about like,

6901
03:02:28,571 --> 03:02:28,721
you know,

6902
03:02:28,721 --> 03:02:29,750
he's fighting GSP.

6903
03:02:29,770 --> 03:02:30,610
He's a good dude,

6904
03:02:30,910 --> 03:02:31,743
great guy.

6905
03:02:32,290 --> 03:02:32,681
We were,

6906
03:02:32,681 --> 03:02:34,480
we were arguing and he was getting like,

6907
03:02:34,481 --> 03:02:35,710
kind of like insulted.

6908
03:02:35,711 --> 03:02:36,100
He was like,

6909
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:37,510
I'm insulted when people say that.

6910
03:02:37,511 --> 03:02:37,691
I'm like,

6911
03:02:37,691 --> 03:02:38,231
I'm sorry.

6912
03:02:38,231 --> 03:02:39,064
I get it.

6913
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:39,850
I get it.

6914
03:02:39,850 --> 03:02:41,290
I was trying to compliment you.

6915
03:02:41,320 --> 03:02:41,620
I'm,

6916
03:02:41,620 --> 03:02:42,130
I'm saying,

6917
03:02:42,130 --> 03:02:43,930
I'm trying to say good things about you,

6918
03:02:43,931 --> 03:02:45,670
but I see how you could see,

6919
03:02:45,671 --> 03:02:45,941
I should,

6920
03:02:45,941 --> 03:02:46,840
I should have kept my mouth shut.

6921
03:02:46,841 --> 03:02:49,410
Was there a couple of adult
beverages going around too?

6922
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:49,731
Yeah.

6923
03:02:49,731 --> 03:02:50,021
Yeah,

6924
03:02:50,021 --> 03:02:50,500
for sure.

6925
03:02:50,500 --> 03:02:51,333
For sure.

6926
03:02:51,450 --> 03:02:52,870
By the end of that conversation,

6927
03:02:52,871 --> 03:02:53,704
if they didn't have a guys.

6928
03:02:54,070 --> 03:02:54,221
Yeah.

6929
03:02:54,221 --> 03:02:54,461
He's like,

6930
03:02:54,461 --> 03:02:54,641
dude,

6931
03:02:54,641 --> 03:02:55,440
I should come up and,

6932
03:02:55,440 --> 03:02:56,081
and trying to do,

6933
03:02:56,081 --> 03:02:57,180
cause I'm finding GSP,

6934
03:02:57,190 --> 03:02:57,401
you know,

6935
03:02:57,401 --> 03:02:58,360
he's going to want to take me down.

6936
03:02:58,361 --> 03:02:59,500
I should get good off my back.

6937
03:02:59,530 --> 03:03:00,341
I'd come up,

6938
03:03:00,341 --> 03:03:00,880
you know,

6939
03:03:00,880 --> 03:03:01,713
we were

6940
03:03:02,940 --> 03:03:05,450
very blessed that he didn't remember.

6941
03:03:05,660 --> 03:03:06,790
So that's what makes him great.

6942
03:03:07,060 --> 03:03:07,893
He's to give you the,

6943
03:03:07,960 --> 03:03:09,010
I know we're all cool.

6944
03:03:09,070 --> 03:03:10,170
He Dm me on Twitter,

6945
03:03:10,180 --> 03:03:10,370
says,

6946
03:03:10,370 --> 03:03:10,540
Dude,

6947
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:11,410
sorry about last night.

6948
03:03:11,411 --> 03:03:11,811
I go do it.

6949
03:03:11,811 --> 03:03:12,644
Don't even trip.

6950
03:03:12,850 --> 03:03:14,050
And I should have kept my mouth shut.

6951
03:03:14,110 --> 03:03:17,930
Is was the biggest fight of his
life coming up at the ghost.

6952
03:03:17,950 --> 03:03:19,090
These just fight for GSB.

6953
03:03:19,091 --> 03:03:20,380
That's a tough fucking fight.

6954
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:22,530
It's a business.

6955
03:03:22,570 --> 03:03:23,403
Take down defense.

6956
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:25,180
Who says it's easiest fight for GSP.

6957
03:03:25,181 --> 03:03:26,014
That's crazy.

6958
03:03:26,020 --> 03:03:26,890
He's way bigger.

6959
03:03:27,100 --> 03:03:28,720
Michael Bisping is a legit one.

6960
03:03:28,721 --> 03:03:30,220
85 of 42 oh five,

6961
03:03:30,330 --> 03:03:31,810
I remember he won the ultimate fighter.

6962
03:03:31,930 --> 03:03:32,321
Oh my God.

6963
03:03:32,321 --> 03:03:33,131
Look at that combination.

6964
03:03:33,131 --> 03:03:33,761
Kaz and Kelvin.

6965
03:03:33,761 --> 03:03:36,160
Just circle one to look at
that again is shown it again.

6966
03:03:36,520 --> 03:03:37,900
Fucking incredible.

6967
03:03:37,990 --> 03:03:39,430
He looks so good.

6968
03:03:40,930 --> 03:03:41,800
God Damn.

6969
03:03:42,100 --> 03:03:43,080
I'd be one legend.

6970
03:03:43,081 --> 03:03:44,020
So it'd be another one.

6971
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:44,921
Calls out.

6972
03:03:44,921 --> 03:03:45,720
Spider Anderson.

6973
03:03:45,720 --> 03:03:46,553
The old man.

6974
03:03:47,290 --> 03:03:49,090
I don't know why it's not.

6975
03:03:49,091 --> 03:03:49,924
It's a good idea.

6976
03:03:50,050 --> 03:03:50,980
Fighting these legends.

6977
03:03:50,981 --> 03:03:51,581
Smoking.

6978
03:03:51,581 --> 03:03:52,000
Um,

6979
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,680
I don't know if I want to see that man.

6980
03:03:54,820 --> 03:03:55,570
You know what I'm saying?

6981
03:03:55,570 --> 03:03:56,620
I'd rather see that than him.

6982
03:03:56,621 --> 03:03:57,680
Verse Jocker a or some,

6983
03:03:57,690 --> 03:03:59,180
Derek Brunson seemed like,

6984
03:03:59,690 --> 03:04:01,520
like he was hypnotized by Anderson.

6985
03:04:01,730 --> 03:04:03,120
He got too much respect for him.

6986
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:04,820
There was moments where in the face,

6987
03:04:04,821 --> 03:04:06,350
so he just didn't seem like,

6988
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:09,470
it just didn't seem like he
found his groove in that.

6989
03:04:09,530 --> 03:04:12,170
Plus he was him coming off of the
knockout loss to Robert Whittaker.

6990
03:04:12,620 --> 03:04:15,180
He's on a long tentative
little switched the time.

6991
03:04:15,290 --> 03:04:16,123
Yeah.

6992
03:04:16,130 --> 03:04:18,260
He tried to go a little technical again.

6993
03:04:18,950 --> 03:04:19,730
Bad idea.

6994
03:04:19,730 --> 03:04:20,301
No one wants,

6995
03:04:20,301 --> 03:04:20,900
you know,

6996
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:22,100
the fans lost on that fight.

6997
03:04:22,101 --> 03:04:22,934
They'll fight sucked.

6998
03:04:22,970 --> 03:04:23,803
How dare you.

6999
03:04:24,410 --> 03:04:24,620
Oh,

7000
03:04:24,620 --> 03:04:25,130
sorry.

7001
03:04:25,130 --> 03:04:26,000
It wasn't the most fine.

7002
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:27,073
It wasn't the best flag.

7003
03:04:27,500 --> 03:04:28,130
Yeah.

7004
03:04:28,130 --> 03:04:29,080
Totten Grisham.

7005
03:04:30,490 --> 03:04:31,070
Um,

7006
03:04:31,070 --> 03:04:33,080
I honestly have not
listened to him at all.

7007
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:34,040
Um,

7008
03:04:34,040 --> 03:04:37,490
because the last time he was doing
something we were doing a fight companion.

7009
03:04:37,491 --> 03:04:38,900
So we talked over this work.

7010
03:04:38,990 --> 03:04:39,823
Who's

7011
03:04:41,030 --> 03:04:42,860
Karen Bryant for this?

7012
03:04:42,861 --> 03:04:44,360
I think Canada and then uh,

7013
03:04:44,420 --> 03:04:46,010
he didn't really take Goldberg spot.

7014
03:04:47,270 --> 03:04:47,870
Well he's,

7015
03:04:47,870 --> 03:04:50,150
he's doing some of the ones
that Anik would have done.

7016
03:04:50,151 --> 03:04:52,280
An antique has kind of
taken up Goldberg spot.

7017
03:04:52,430 --> 03:04:53,690
I like you and dom together,

7018
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:54,820
the chemistry.

7019
03:04:54,860 --> 03:04:56,060
You and Tom is the best for me.

7020
03:04:56,061 --> 03:04:57,650
I think I like him.

7021
03:04:57,950 --> 03:05:00,110
I liked doing it with him and
I liked doing it with DC too.

7022
03:05:00,140 --> 03:05:00,973
I liked both of them.

7023
03:05:01,550 --> 03:05:04,980
Makes Bisbing so incredible
is not only did he eve,

7024
03:05:05,730 --> 03:05:06,950
is that the fact that he's,

7025
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:09,620
he got the belt basically with
a half an eye to that's got,

7026
03:05:09,621 --> 03:05:10,191
that's got to play.

7027
03:05:10,191 --> 03:05:11,560
He did after years,

7028
03:05:11,570 --> 03:05:11,950
man.

7029
03:05:11,950 --> 03:05:13,340
Like he's been grinding.

7030
03:05:13,770 --> 03:05:14,760
He deserves the morning.

7031
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:16,330
He never got a call for any PA.

7032
03:05:16,340 --> 03:05:17,000
Dot.

7033
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,340
All claims to only PD guys really?

7034
03:05:19,700 --> 03:05:21,120
Like he's been fucked man.

7035
03:05:21,140 --> 03:05:26,140
Then he becomes champ on a seven day
notice shooting a man ass knocked out Luke

7036
03:05:26,930 --> 03:05:29,690
Rockhold no Silva but and then he revenge
is his loss against Dan Henderson.

7037
03:05:29,720 --> 03:05:30,900
It's not his story.

7038
03:05:30,901 --> 03:05:31,740
So cool man.

7039
03:05:31,970 --> 03:05:33,170
It is a crazy story.

7040
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:34,273
It's beautiful.

7041
03:05:34,310 --> 03:05:35,030
I mean it's,

7042
03:05:35,030 --> 03:05:39,470
it's all just heart and we'll
look at this common nation man,

7043
03:05:40,040 --> 03:05:40,601
him and Vito.

7044
03:05:40,601 --> 03:05:41,000
I mean,

7045
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,940
oh see how he tagged him with
that jab snapped his head back.

7046
03:05:45,200 --> 03:05:46,810
We're still got that spinning kick though.

7047
03:05:46,960 --> 03:05:48,170
It keeps you looking for it though.

7048
03:05:48,860 --> 03:05:49,750
Oh Jesus.

7049
03:05:49,810 --> 03:05:51,290
He gets his head snapped back.

7050
03:05:51,620 --> 03:05:52,400
Big John.

7051
03:05:52,400 --> 03:05:53,710
That's a function of a smell.

7052
03:05:54,010 --> 03:05:54,741
A younger,

7053
03:05:54,741 --> 03:05:55,670
faster guy.

7054
03:05:56,210 --> 03:05:59,000
Well [inaudible] Stevie toward
never had combinations like that.

7055
03:05:59,210 --> 03:06:03,110
Fee towards combinations were like
straight line blitzkrieg attacks would,

7056
03:06:03,111 --> 03:06:07,130
Calvin's doing is hitting these crazy
angles with beautiful precision.

7057
03:06:07,310 --> 03:06:09,620
Like if you look at the way
he's delivering his punches,

7058
03:06:09,621 --> 03:06:11,390
it's really some next level shit.

7059
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:15,680
He's one of the best punchers in MMA
right now because what he's doing is he's

7060
03:06:15,681 --> 03:06:19,460
sliding in and he's not
loading up on these shots.

7061
03:06:19,461 --> 03:06:23,710
He's throwing them with perfect efficiency
and just Tatainia [inaudible] in his

7062
03:06:24,120 --> 03:06:27,830
[inaudible] straight straight everything.

7063
03:06:27,860 --> 03:06:31,070
And he moves his body
side to side really well.

7064
03:06:31,580 --> 03:06:32,630
Like he look how he's like,

7065
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:33,493
look at like,

7066
03:06:33,890 --> 03:06:34,820
Oh man,

7067
03:06:34,821 --> 03:06:35,654
it's beautiful.

7068
03:06:36,050 --> 03:06:37,570
The Way Lens at lefthand,

7069
03:06:37,580 --> 03:06:38,780
it's fucking phenomenal.

7070
03:06:38,781 --> 03:06:41,140
Hardest Shit to look at this.

7071
03:06:41,260 --> 03:06:45,980
Come on straight down with that left hand.

7072
03:06:46,370 --> 03:06:46,971
Good Lord.

7073
03:06:46,971 --> 03:06:47,450
Look at this.

7074
03:06:47,450 --> 03:06:49,520
Don't Dank without an elbow.

7075
03:06:49,700 --> 03:06:50,211
No,

7076
03:06:50,211 --> 03:06:50,490
no.

7077
03:06:50,490 --> 03:06:51,240
Just punches,

7078
03:06:51,240 --> 03:06:52,073
man.

7079
03:06:52,510 --> 03:06:53,343
Excellent.

7080
03:06:53,690 --> 03:06:54,860
Oh,

7081
03:06:54,861 --> 03:06:56,160
what a beautiful shot.

7082
03:06:56,570 --> 03:06:57,490
Overwhelmed.

7083
03:06:57,630 --> 03:07:00,150
Ever bring that shit into my fucking cage.

7084
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:04,710
[inaudible] 1980s show that got
canceled after two episodes.

7085
03:07:04,711 --> 03:07:04,911
You know?

7086
03:07:04,911 --> 03:07:05,080
No.

7087
03:07:05,080 --> 03:07:09,450
Did a group of mercenaries in the cage
fight on the side to path to choose

7088
03:07:09,451 --> 03:07:14,340
whether they work for the government
or pursue a career in cage fighting.

7089
03:07:15,540 --> 03:07:16,790
Cage fighting wasn't even a real thing.

7090
03:07:16,970 --> 03:07:18,400
I make a fucking choice.

7091
03:07:18,410 --> 03:07:19,171
They had cage fighting,

7092
03:07:19,171 --> 03:07:23,910
but that's why those pka karate shoes
from like the 1980s and they wore long

7093
03:07:23,940 --> 03:07:25,320
will those long shiny pants.

7094
03:07:25,650 --> 03:07:28,650
Remember those karate paths and he had
the black belt on it over the shiny

7095
03:07:28,651 --> 03:07:29,460
pants.

7096
03:07:29,460 --> 03:07:32,810
The one that Brian's do we say
awesome things like this in mind.

7097
03:07:32,950 --> 03:07:33,810
When we want to leave,

7098
03:07:33,811 --> 03:07:34,290
we got like this.

7099
03:07:34,290 --> 03:07:34,650
I go,

7100
03:07:34,650 --> 03:07:35,430
hey guys,

7101
03:07:35,430 --> 03:07:37,110
let's blow this fucking joint.

7102
03:07:37,230 --> 03:07:39,180
I say that and then,

7103
03:07:39,181 --> 03:07:43,560
and then I felt like the whole
joint and then I go like this.

7104
03:07:43,561 --> 03:07:45,350
I go and when we really
want to get my voice,

7105
03:07:45,351 --> 03:07:45,840
when I go,

7106
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:47,640
let's fucking go.

7107
03:07:48,060 --> 03:07:53,060
So g o with a lot of bows
after moving out that the funk,

7108
03:07:55,290 --> 03:07:57,750
you don't like my fucking
homie because it's man shit.

7109
03:07:58,170 --> 03:08:00,300
Let's go get some fucking
burgers after we left.

7110
03:08:00,310 --> 03:08:02,640
Or we hear when other people
are talking about what happened.

7111
03:08:02,641 --> 03:08:02,850
What?

7112
03:08:02,850 --> 03:08:03,121
Dude,

7113
03:08:03,121 --> 03:08:05,880
I'm fucking not even letting me fucking,

7114
03:08:06,380 --> 03:08:07,320
Eddie was talking.

7115
03:08:07,610 --> 03:08:12,610
It wasn't martial arts movie called no
rules as frank shamrock scinet Randy

7116
03:08:14,131 --> 03:08:14,641
couture's.

7117
03:08:14,641 --> 03:08:15,870
Then it Tom Sizemore,

7118
03:08:15,871 --> 03:08:16,140
isn't it?

7119
03:08:16,140 --> 03:08:18,430
When he's like Todd sign
needed cash and he's like,

7120
03:08:19,110 --> 03:08:20,910
it's rehabs and everything.

7121
03:08:21,490 --> 03:08:26,490
He's in the movie as the main fight or
Thomas Iso hell and he wore a sweater

7122
03:08:26,521 --> 03:08:28,070
when he fought like a loose sweater.

7123
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:30,470
He was like in the worst shape of my life.

7124
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:35,840
No rules you God.

7125
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:37,080
I'm going to see.

7126
03:08:41,340 --> 03:08:42,150
Why don't we,

7127
03:08:42,150 --> 03:08:42,480
here it is.

7128
03:08:42,480 --> 03:08:44,060
Look up at the screen
left that we should do.

7129
03:08:44,250 --> 03:08:45,130
Why don't we do this?

7130
03:08:45,250 --> 03:08:46,083
What I was going to say.

7131
03:08:46,140 --> 03:08:46,973
It's amazing.

7132
03:08:47,640 --> 03:08:50,340
Pamela Anderson's
brother wrote the script.

7133
03:08:50,450 --> 03:08:51,480
That sounds like a bad idea.

7134
03:08:52,340 --> 03:08:53,173
Ah,

7135
03:08:56,730 --> 03:08:57,480
hold on.

7136
03:08:57,480 --> 03:09:00,150
This trailer to look at a
fire behind Mullah Anderson.

7137
03:09:00,151 --> 03:09:01,400
Pamela Anderson was in it in two.

7138
03:09:01,430 --> 03:09:01,891
I'm five.

7139
03:09:01,891 --> 03:09:03,210
I'm only supposed to be in it,

7140
03:09:03,211 --> 03:09:03,660
but I,

7141
03:09:03,660 --> 03:09:06,060
I failed because I had a seminar.

7142
03:09:06,061 --> 03:09:06,331
I'm like,

7143
03:09:06,331 --> 03:09:06,890
dude,

7144
03:09:06,890 --> 03:09:07,930
I'm proud of you Eddie.

7145
03:09:08,060 --> 03:09:09,030
Jacques was going to be an a,

7146
03:09:09,031 --> 03:09:11,020
he bailed for Tom Sizemore for sure.

7147
03:09:12,060 --> 03:09:14,940
He was proud of you and
we're not doing this.

7148
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:18,120
Why did they agree to have
Tom Sizemore and the sweater?

7149
03:09:18,121 --> 03:09:21,600
Was that like the stipulation
is that they could get him?

7150
03:09:22,920 --> 03:09:23,753
Oh

7151
03:09:25,260 --> 03:09:25,681
yeah,

7152
03:09:25,681 --> 03:09:26,514
I remember Dave,

7153
03:09:26,850 --> 03:09:30,660
you always have to have the see where
he's contemplating what he looks super

7154
03:09:30,661 --> 03:09:33,600
important to [inaudible] 87

7155
03:09:35,190 --> 03:09:35,670
and uh,

7156
03:09:35,670 --> 03:09:37,770
there's an evil fight team and they do,

7157
03:09:37,830 --> 03:09:40,230
when they do Omoplata as
it's like a satanic thing,

7158
03:09:40,320 --> 03:09:41,370
they kill you with Elma,

7159
03:09:41,371 --> 03:09:42,204
Blah.

7160
03:09:42,330 --> 03:09:43,230
No joke.

7161
03:09:44,070 --> 03:09:47,170
Frank Shamrock is part of the
evil fight team at the tap out.

7162
03:09:47,190 --> 03:09:48,120
They killed people.

7163
03:09:48,950 --> 03:09:49,400
Oh,

7164
03:09:49,400 --> 03:09:50,233
is that his handle?

7165
03:09:50,820 --> 03:09:51,361
Shit.

7166
03:09:51,361 --> 03:09:52,194
She made a cameo.

7167
03:09:52,230 --> 03:09:53,260
She did this and Barb,

7168
03:09:53,280 --> 03:09:54,670
why threw something at him?

7169
03:09:55,150 --> 03:09:55,983
Oh,

7170
03:09:56,140 --> 03:09:56,973
face.

7171
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:57,993
Whoa.

7172
03:09:58,340 --> 03:10:00,510
That guy's done with the backfill,

7173
03:10:02,210 --> 03:10:04,970
the upper cut that launches the
dude upside down and back sheet

7174
03:10:06,740 --> 03:10:07,870
real John.

7175
03:10:07,871 --> 03:10:09,370
Jack was going to be shooting back.

7176
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:12,590
So they called me up,

7177
03:10:13,020 --> 03:10:13,853
backed out,

7178
03:10:13,980 --> 03:10:14,420
and I,

7179
03:10:14,420 --> 03:10:14,831
and he goes,

7180
03:10:14,831 --> 03:10:16,060
do we need another villain?

7181
03:10:16,360 --> 03:10:19,000
And I knew Randy couture was
thinking about being in movies.

7182
03:10:19,001 --> 03:10:19,301
I said,

7183
03:10:19,301 --> 03:10:20,410
maybe I could call Randy.

7184
03:10:20,620 --> 03:10:21,640
So I called Randy.

7185
03:10:21,700 --> 03:10:23,050
I know you want to do a movie.

7186
03:10:23,330 --> 03:10:23,560
Uh,

7187
03:10:23,560 --> 03:10:24,281
they need a villain.

7188
03:10:24,281 --> 03:10:25,114
Last minute,

7189
03:10:25,150 --> 03:10:27,150
Randy couture jumped in and he did it.

7190
03:10:27,370 --> 03:10:28,330
So now if we,

7191
03:10:28,331 --> 03:10:29,710
if we do something like this,

7192
03:10:30,460 --> 03:10:33,700
it almost can't be a standalone thing.

7193
03:10:34,330 --> 03:10:36,850
We really almost need
some of the dialogue.

7194
03:10:36,890 --> 03:10:37,723
We

7195
03:10:39,330 --> 03:10:40,990
need to hear what the
fuck we're referring to.

7196
03:10:40,991 --> 03:10:41,880
It's a great movie.

7197
03:10:41,930 --> 03:10:43,660
Now is this a movie that
they can get online?

7198
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:47,150
The evil fight like a French Hammer.

7199
03:10:47,180 --> 03:10:48,013
Greg,

7200
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:48,953
Gary Busey,

7201
03:10:49,530 --> 03:10:51,460
the Satanic Fight Club.

7202
03:10:52,300 --> 03:10:53,140
Frank Shamrock,

7203
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:55,873
shamrock

7204
03:10:57,010 --> 03:10:58,150
satanic fight team.

7205
03:10:58,420 --> 03:11:01,620
Look at Gary Busey the best dude.

7206
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:03,360
I can't believe no one's career boomed up.

7207
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:06,690
I broke his back.

7208
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:09,513
Shoulders.

7209
03:11:09,870 --> 03:11:11,260
That's MMA bible.

7210
03:11:11,590 --> 03:11:13,240
Let's Randy Young.

7211
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:14,170
Randy coture.

7212
03:11:14,580 --> 03:11:15,560
This is like amazing.

7213
03:11:15,770 --> 03:11:17,110
What is Randy up to these days?

7214
03:11:17,111 --> 03:11:17,950
Anybody talked to him?

7215
03:11:18,460 --> 03:11:19,690
He was so large.

7216
03:11:19,780 --> 03:11:23,830
Look at that Randy and he was on our show
a little bit ago doing the damn thing.

7217
03:11:23,831 --> 03:11:23,980
Yeah.

7218
03:11:23,980 --> 03:11:24,813
What's he been doing?

7219
03:11:24,970 --> 03:11:25,451
He's doing,

7220
03:11:25,451 --> 03:11:29,500
he's involved with that fighters' union
thing and then he's making movies.

7221
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:32,140
Which fighters' union thing
isn't there like three of them?

7222
03:11:32,170 --> 03:11:36,430
They're all Duke martial arts associate
Athletic Association and then there's

7223
03:11:36,431 --> 03:11:37,031
the union.

7224
03:11:37,031 --> 03:11:37,930
He's part of the union.

7225
03:11:38,320 --> 03:11:39,280
What's the better one?

7226
03:11:39,520 --> 03:11:39,690
Oh,

7227
03:11:39,690 --> 03:11:40,830
there were training montage.

7228
03:11:40,840 --> 03:11:41,673
Super important.

7229
03:11:41,860 --> 03:11:45,850
So show your destiny
hunching ropes and stuff.

7230
03:11:45,910 --> 03:11:46,151
Yeah,

7231
03:11:46,151 --> 03:11:47,020
McKinney water.

7232
03:11:47,230 --> 03:11:51,160
This is an amazing moving this
just like my life in the 80s man,

7233
03:11:51,161 --> 03:11:52,150
when I ran with that game,

7234
03:11:52,180 --> 03:11:53,610
this is my nineties called the,

7235
03:11:54,220 --> 03:11:57,910
Oh this is just taken after it was taken
off of my dragon gang that I used to

7236
03:11:57,911 --> 03:11:58,180
run with.

7237
03:11:58,180 --> 03:12:03,010
No rules was seriously.

7238
03:12:03,430 --> 03:12:06,910
That was right when the ultimate
fighter was made that movie.

7239
03:12:06,911 --> 03:12:08,310
So they're trying to
capitalize on that shit.

7240
03:12:08,340 --> 03:12:08,560
No,

7241
03:12:08,560 --> 03:12:09,850
they probably didn't know about it yet.

7242
03:12:09,880 --> 03:12:12,910
It was probably like in the process
they saw how it really goes down like,

7243
03:12:12,940 --> 03:12:13,940
ah shit.

7244
03:12:14,630 --> 03:12:15,100
Damn it.

7245
03:12:15,100 --> 03:12:17,220
There's no Satan worship in heaven.

7246
03:12:20,970 --> 03:12:22,980
I remember reading the script part of what

7247
03:12:26,060 --> 03:12:26,893
they must have.

7248
03:12:27,990 --> 03:12:31,070
I bet if we had a show where we just
want to run back to where they should,

7249
03:12:31,360 --> 03:12:32,290
they should be happy.

7250
03:12:32,380 --> 03:12:35,770
I bet if we had a show where we just
watch bad movies and did a companion for

7251
03:12:35,771 --> 03:12:36,590
bad motors,

7252
03:12:36,590 --> 03:12:37,120
there's,

7253
03:12:37,120 --> 03:12:38,650
you'll never run out of movies.

7254
03:12:38,680 --> 03:12:40,330
You never read a shitty movies.

7255
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:41,800
You know what they told
him that he'd go work,

7256
03:12:41,801 --> 03:12:45,670
sit in play now you give everyone
a week's notice on Monday,

7257
03:12:45,671 --> 03:12:45,851
go,

7258
03:12:45,851 --> 03:12:46,001
hey,

7259
03:12:46,001 --> 03:12:51,001
we're watching a fucking naked gun on
Friday playing it now and everyone has

7260
03:12:51,921 --> 03:12:52,230
naked

7261
03:12:52,230 --> 03:12:54,380
done chews it up.

7262
03:12:54,440 --> 03:12:55,100
Yes.

7263
03:12:55,100 --> 03:12:56,450
And then we all watched it together.

7264
03:12:56,630 --> 03:12:56,990
Yeah,

7265
03:12:56,990 --> 03:12:57,710
like Greece.

7266
03:12:57,710 --> 03:13:00,050
I was watching Gracie in the
night with John Travolta and I,

7267
03:13:00,060 --> 03:13:01,010
I mean I made a um,

7268
03:13:01,290 --> 03:13:01,600
uh,

7269
03:13:01,600 --> 03:13:02,810
send a text message to Jamie.

7270
03:13:02,811 --> 03:13:03,021
I said,

7271
03:13:03,021 --> 03:13:06,350
we should do a fight companion for the
movie grease to cause that was high and I

7272
03:13:06,351 --> 03:13:10,550
was watching them then
multiply and I'm losing control

7273
03:13:12,580 --> 03:13:13,460
your supply.

7274
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:15,110
It's electrify

7275
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:22,040
the producer that just said,

7276
03:13:22,041 --> 03:13:22,600
dude,

7277
03:13:22,600 --> 03:13:25,550
if you can't be fucking Randy couture,

7278
03:13:26,480 --> 03:13:28,400
make your parts so much bigger.

7279
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:30,630
And I'm like,

7280
03:13:30,630 --> 03:13:31,463
whatever.

7281
03:13:32,900 --> 03:13:34,260
Then I bailed like two weeks later.

7282
03:13:34,410 --> 03:13:36,210
I got to find a way to pay a bad idea.

7283
03:13:37,810 --> 03:13:40,280
It was that Satanic Alma
plot does that got me.

7284
03:13:40,460 --> 03:13:41,061
It got John,

7285
03:13:41,061 --> 03:13:41,391
John,

7286
03:13:41,391 --> 03:13:41,601
John.

7287
03:13:41,601 --> 03:13:44,150
Jack said he let somebody read the script.

7288
03:13:46,730 --> 03:13:48,070
Oh port.

7289
03:13:50,770 --> 03:13:52,250
This will ruin your name.

7290
03:13:52,251 --> 03:13:55,000
You can die from an Omoplata.

7291
03:13:55,010 --> 03:13:57,390
Does your arm just rip
off and you bleed or what?

7292
03:13:57,630 --> 03:13:58,080
You know what?

7293
03:13:58,080 --> 03:13:59,000
I never got,

7294
03:13:59,990 --> 03:14:01,040
I never got them right.

7295
03:14:01,041 --> 03:14:01,490
You do.

7296
03:14:01,490 --> 03:14:03,110
You get there like 20
minutes and you're like,

7297
03:14:03,111 --> 03:14:03,291
cool.

7298
03:14:03,291 --> 03:14:04,124
I get it.

7299
03:14:05,750 --> 03:14:06,583
20 minutes

7300
03:14:09,830 --> 03:14:11,290
series of movies like that,

7301
03:14:11,450 --> 03:14:12,283
you get a bunch of them.

7302
03:14:12,500 --> 03:14:13,580
This is my favorite commercial,

7303
03:14:13,790 --> 03:14:15,030
Patrick Swayze and roadhouse.

7304
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:16,160
I'm getting a tiny pony.

7305
03:14:17,530 --> 03:14:17,720
Yeah,

7306
03:14:17,720 --> 03:14:20,510
but Patrick Swayze and Rose House
is almost been done to death.

7307
03:14:20,690 --> 03:14:22,370
I live tweeted at once.

7308
03:14:22,371 --> 03:14:24,320
I'll watch the or instagrammed it.

7309
03:14:24,620 --> 03:14:24,861
I know,

7310
03:14:24,861 --> 03:14:26,600
I realized how homoerotic it is.

7311
03:14:27,170 --> 03:14:28,670
It's insanely homoerotic.

7312
03:14:28,671 --> 03:14:31,640
I went through a whole series of tweets
where like I highlighted what their

7313
03:14:31,641 --> 03:14:32,181
quotes were,

7314
03:14:32,181 --> 03:14:33,230
what the fuck they said.

7315
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:37,330
Do you want to say the gay scene of all
time is the volleyball season first top

7316
03:14:37,331 --> 03:14:38,030
gun.

7317
03:14:38,030 --> 03:14:38,310
Go ahead.

7318
03:14:38,310 --> 03:14:40,610
Pull that up to the whole thing that,

7319
03:14:40,730 --> 03:14:41,960
this is an interesting story.

7320
03:14:42,230 --> 03:14:46,130
This is a whole thing that
Quintin Tarantino put in a movie,

7321
03:14:46,370 --> 03:14:47,980
but apparently it's something that uh,

7322
03:14:47,981 --> 03:14:49,370
Roger Avery thing,

7323
03:14:49,400 --> 03:14:49,731
there's like,

7324
03:14:49,731 --> 03:14:51,020
you could read it up online,

7325
03:14:51,260 --> 03:14:54,020
but it's apparently
Roger Avery theory that,

7326
03:14:54,470 --> 03:14:54,711
you know,

7327
03:14:54,711 --> 03:14:58,850
Roger Avery would make killing Zoe
who's a brilliant actor or brilliant

7328
03:14:59,060 --> 03:14:59,541
director,

7329
03:14:59,541 --> 03:15:03,650
writer and a wound up killing a guy in
a drunk driving accident wound up doing

7330
03:15:03,651 --> 03:15:05,810
jail time and it was
like tweeting from jail.

7331
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:06,410
Damn.

7332
03:15:06,410 --> 03:15:08,360
If I remember correctly in
the early days of Twitter,

7333
03:15:08,361 --> 03:15:09,171
I'm not making that up.

7334
03:15:09,171 --> 03:15:09,381
Right.

7335
03:15:09,381 --> 03:15:12,680
Is that isn't that the case was tweeting
I think from the early days of jail.

7336
03:15:12,830 --> 03:15:16,310
But this top gun according to Tarantino,

7337
03:15:16,430 --> 03:15:21,430
according to Roger Avery was his theory
is like say if you had a theory and you

7338
03:15:22,581 --> 03:15:23,450
were always talking about it,

7339
03:15:23,451 --> 03:15:27,170
you'd polished it up and made it really
funny and he told the shop and shop goes

7340
03:15:27,171 --> 03:15:31,280
on like Fox News and starts talking
about here's my theory B and like he just

7341
03:15:31,281 --> 03:15:32,450
rattles off your stuff.

7342
03:15:32,690 --> 03:15:34,570
That's kind of what he did allegedly.

7343
03:15:34,580 --> 03:15:35,450
What was he saying about it?

7344
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:38,090
Well it's just that top gun is gay,

7345
03:15:38,460 --> 03:15:39,111
like couldn't tear.

7346
03:15:39,111 --> 03:15:42,770
And Tito goes through this whole thing
about all the different various moments

7347
03:15:42,771 --> 03:15:47,320
where you realize what the hidden
subtext is and it's all homosexual isn't

7348
03:15:47,370 --> 03:15:47,631
really,

7349
03:15:47,631 --> 03:15:49,160
I don't know that she's hilarious.

7350
03:15:49,290 --> 03:15:50,250
Can can't play it.

7351
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:52,070
Oh they'll kick us off
of youtube with the,

7352
03:15:52,140 --> 03:15:53,430
but we'll play it after the podcast.

7353
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:54,993
Volleyball seen that.

7354
03:15:55,220 --> 03:15:55,410
No,

7355
03:15:55,410 --> 03:16:00,410
we can't play the Quentin Tarantino
dissection of top gun because if we do

7356
03:16:01,530 --> 03:16:04,350
they'll kick us off of youtube cause it's
not our context that the actual movie

7357
03:16:04,351 --> 03:16:05,100
right there it is.

7358
03:16:05,100 --> 03:16:06,480
Everything gets kicked off youtube.

7359
03:16:06,481 --> 03:16:07,680
People own their content.

7360
03:16:07,920 --> 03:16:08,281
You know,

7361
03:16:08,281 --> 03:16:08,791
if you,

7362
03:16:08,791 --> 03:16:09,601
if you make something,

7363
03:16:09,601 --> 03:16:12,750
whether it's a movie or a song or
anything and someone puts it on a youtube

7364
03:16:12,751 --> 03:16:14,670
thing and then puts it up on youtube,

7365
03:16:14,910 --> 03:16:15,420
this shut it.

7366
03:16:15,420 --> 03:16:16,200
They shut it down.

7367
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:18,660
Shut down for showing a
planet earth to the Lizard.

7368
03:16:18,661 --> 03:16:19,494
Grown from snakes.

7369
03:16:19,930 --> 03:16:21,630
They shut it down like minutes.

7370
03:16:21,750 --> 03:16:22,230
Oh yeah.

7371
03:16:22,230 --> 03:16:22,950
Well all those,

7372
03:16:22,950 --> 03:16:27,950
apparently that's one of the most
lucrative video segments is the animal tax

7373
03:16:28,501 --> 03:16:32,910
segment because people love watching
those animals attack other animals and tag

7374
03:16:32,911 --> 03:16:33,511
people.

7375
03:16:33,511 --> 03:16:35,130
And anytime does a video like that,

7376
03:16:35,131 --> 03:16:36,450
if you throw that shit up on Facebook,

7377
03:16:36,451 --> 03:16:37,620
it's going to get your page shut down.

7378
03:16:37,621 --> 03:16:37,920
Yeah,

7379
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:38,470
it's happening.

7380
03:16:38,470 --> 03:16:41,430
Quickness too quick and they shut
my page and I for like three days,

7381
03:16:42,450 --> 03:16:45,750
there are a little bit cooler but it's
gonna eventually bleed over to that too.

7382
03:16:45,751 --> 03:16:47,490
Cause doesn't Google own Instagram.

7383
03:16:47,910 --> 03:16:48,990
Facebook owns Instagram.

7384
03:16:48,991 --> 03:16:50,040
So serious is the same thing.

7385
03:16:50,420 --> 03:16:52,370
There's going to hit here's Kinda poster.

7386
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:53,790
Goddamn fucking reptile.

7387
03:16:53,970 --> 03:16:54,211
Yeah.

7388
03:16:54,211 --> 03:16:57,700
But the problem is somebody owns that
reptile video on youtube and they're

7389
03:16:57,720 --> 03:17:01,290
making money off the ads and it's real
money because a lot of those videos,

7390
03:17:01,320 --> 03:17:02,170
it's hundred percent fair,

7391
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:03,930
fair look,

7392
03:17:04,020 --> 03:17:04,950
we just want to see it.

7393
03:17:05,190 --> 03:17:05,611
Okay.

7394
03:17:05,611 --> 03:17:07,650
If I can put it up on my
page and show everybody,

7395
03:17:07,651 --> 03:17:08,520
and that's cool too,

7396
03:17:08,730 --> 03:17:09,840
but I just want to see it.

7397
03:17:09,870 --> 03:17:11,050
So if people are showing up,

7398
03:17:11,290 --> 03:17:14,310
whatever's going to make sure these people
put up more of those videos as good.

7399
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:14,521
I mean,

7400
03:17:14,521 --> 03:17:17,190
I'm not in the fucking
animal tag video business.

7401
03:17:17,191 --> 03:17:17,570
You know,

7402
03:17:17,570 --> 03:17:18,390
it'd be cool.

7403
03:17:18,390 --> 03:17:21,810
It'd be cool is if you repost
a video from planet video,

7404
03:17:21,811 --> 03:17:22,920
whatever planet attacks,

7405
03:17:22,921 --> 03:17:23,970
animal tax,

7406
03:17:24,150 --> 03:17:26,350
and then they get paid no matter
what because you're always follows.

7407
03:17:26,460 --> 03:17:27,191
They still get the pay.

7408
03:17:27,191 --> 03:17:31,860
But you can get a show that maybe they
want to generate more subscribers under

7409
03:17:31,861 --> 03:17:32,641
their page though,

7410
03:17:32,641 --> 03:17:35,130
and the argument can be made
who had it somewhere else.

7411
03:17:35,310 --> 03:17:38,490
It's somehow or another Mike keep
people from subscribing to their page.

7412
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:39,271
That's the argument.

7413
03:17:39,271 --> 03:17:41,870
We did this thing on fighting
the kid three day where I had,

7414
03:17:41,950 --> 03:17:46,950
I put on a deer suit and print and put
on a lion suit and I had to kind of run

7415
03:17:47,641 --> 03:17:48,360
away from him,

7416
03:17:48,360 --> 03:17:49,680
like on my hands and knees,

7417
03:17:49,681 --> 03:17:51,060
like on my hands and feet.

7418
03:17:51,350 --> 03:17:55,260
It was for the sketch and he would come
over and just jump in the air and land

7419
03:17:55,261 --> 03:17:56,010
on me.

7420
03:17:56,010 --> 03:17:57,300
I was so fucking worried.

7421
03:17:57,301 --> 03:17:59,040
My back was going to
break every single time,

7422
03:17:59,041 --> 03:18:01,620
but I was just thinking about how
ridiculous that fucking sketch was.

7423
03:18:01,670 --> 03:18:03,340
We were both dressed as
a little bit rejects.

7424
03:18:03,341 --> 03:18:04,970
Then when we're talking
about real animal attacks,

7425
03:18:05,090 --> 03:18:05,610
well,

7426
03:18:05,610 --> 03:18:06,540
it was very similar.

7427
03:18:06,680 --> 03:18:06,870
Yeah,

7428
03:18:06,870 --> 03:18:09,660
but it just gives you a nice opportunity
to talk about fighter and the kid three

7429
03:18:09,661 --> 03:18:09,841
d,

7430
03:18:09,841 --> 03:18:10,740
which is available now.

7431
03:18:11,830 --> 03:18:13,190
I don't even know if it has.

7432
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:14,090
Fox owns that,

7433
03:18:14,990 --> 03:18:19,080
but they're not releasing Barack up.

7434
03:18:19,220 --> 03:18:19,420
Yeah.

7435
03:18:19,420 --> 03:18:23,550
Since we separated a no divorce made
all those sketches and now people can't

7436
03:18:23,551 --> 03:18:24,001
watch them.

7437
03:18:24,001 --> 03:18:24,730
It's a bright man,

7438
03:18:24,730 --> 03:18:25,530
but they have to pay.

7439
03:18:25,530 --> 03:18:25,980
Do you know what?

7440
03:18:25,980 --> 03:18:27,300
It's all over online.

7441
03:18:27,320 --> 03:18:28,050
Everybody's dumb.

7442
03:18:28,050 --> 03:18:29,970
Don't pay from them to do some research.

7443
03:18:29,970 --> 03:18:30,691
You can find the leave.

7444
03:18:30,691 --> 03:18:32,250
What your sister and
some of them are good.

7445
03:18:32,260 --> 03:18:34,560
I'm pros finishes and UFC pride.

7446
03:18:34,561 --> 03:18:39,561
Wec Strikeforce history shogun right up
there with 17 Donald Serone 17 Vandelay

7447
03:18:40,051 --> 03:18:42,000
20 and cro cop number one,

7448
03:18:42,240 --> 03:18:44,040
cro Coppin on Mount Rushmore.

7449
03:18:44,180 --> 03:18:44,621
Oh,

7450
03:18:44,621 --> 03:18:45,454
that's a good question.

7451
03:18:45,480 --> 03:18:45,811
Five,

7452
03:18:45,811 --> 03:18:47,100
he never not in the UFC.

7453
03:18:47,110 --> 03:18:49,660
He never really performed to the
best of his ability in the UFC.

7454
03:18:50,140 --> 03:18:52,030
He also never looked this well.

7455
03:18:52,480 --> 03:18:53,680
Who knows what that's all about.

7456
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:54,250
You know,

7457
03:18:54,250 --> 03:18:57,220
but he never looked the same when he
came from Strikeforce or excuse me,

7458
03:18:57,350 --> 03:18:58,810
pride over to the UFC.

7459
03:18:59,130 --> 03:19:00,310
The UFC did work.

7460
03:19:00,311 --> 03:19:02,120
Kim K one champion rise.

7461
03:19:02,180 --> 03:19:03,280
It's fucking nuts.

7462
03:19:03,310 --> 03:19:03,790
Well,

7463
03:19:03,790 --> 03:19:05,770
you know he got back on
the Mexican supplements,

7464
03:19:05,771 --> 03:19:06,604
let's be honest.

7465
03:19:06,940 --> 03:19:09,760
But he was also a Mexican summons
for a little bit during the UFC.

7466
03:19:09,761 --> 03:19:12,490
Let's be 100% exemption.

7467
03:19:12,520 --> 03:19:13,750
You think he had,

7468
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:15,100
he was on TRT exemption.

7469
03:19:15,430 --> 03:19:16,263
Really?

7470
03:19:16,270 --> 03:19:17,140
He had TRT?

7471
03:19:17,170 --> 03:19:18,003
I think so.

7472
03:19:18,400 --> 03:19:19,780
Well don't they have to
announce that though?

7473
03:19:19,840 --> 03:19:20,171
No.

7474
03:19:20,171 --> 03:19:20,561
Hell No.

7475
03:19:20,561 --> 03:19:22,120
They don't have to know
how many people had it.

7476
03:19:22,210 --> 03:19:22,871
Oh Man.

7477
03:19:22,871 --> 03:19:23,471
A good amount.

7478
03:19:23,471 --> 03:19:26,860
And then because the floodgates open
because once people found out other guys

7479
03:19:26,861 --> 03:19:27,401
were doing it,

7480
03:19:27,401 --> 03:19:29,470
they had to put a stop to
it because you have to get,

7481
03:19:29,471 --> 03:19:33,400
go through certain people
to get it and then you know,

7482
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:36,700
it was just a bad look because once you
know how if the advantage and everyone

7483
03:19:36,701 --> 03:19:37,534
wants to do it,

7484
03:19:37,690 --> 03:19:37,901
yeah,

7485
03:19:37,901 --> 03:19:41,140
it was weird for a few years because it
was legal for a few years and everybody

7486
03:19:41,141 --> 03:19:41,411
was like,

7487
03:19:41,411 --> 03:19:44,800
what are they doing with
Terry do TRT fucked,

7488
03:19:44,820 --> 03:19:46,000
you know the flood gates open.

7489
03:19:46,001 --> 03:19:46,631
But then they're like,

7490
03:19:46,631 --> 03:19:46,841
no,

7491
03:19:46,841 --> 03:19:47,560
hell no.

7492
03:19:47,560 --> 03:19:47,880
Hold on.

7493
03:19:47,880 --> 03:19:49,180
Wait that like the,

7494
03:19:49,320 --> 03:19:54,320
she'll levels like you could
be doing that stuff every day.

7495
03:19:55,090 --> 03:19:55,791
I mean what,

7496
03:19:55,791 --> 03:19:56,101
what,

7497
03:19:56,101 --> 03:19:56,530
what,

7498
03:19:56,530 --> 03:19:56,951
what are they,

7499
03:19:56,951 --> 03:20:00,430
as long as you're staying under some
ridiculously high level and some of them

7500
03:20:00,431 --> 03:20:01,270
that did get caught,

7501
03:20:01,271 --> 03:20:02,800
like one of the reasons
why it got shut down,

7502
03:20:02,801 --> 03:20:07,801
it was when they caught Veit tour and
he was at like 1,470 and the doctor was

7503
03:20:08,021 --> 03:20:08,291
like,

7504
03:20:08,291 --> 03:20:09,670
well this isn't even healthy.

7505
03:20:09,670 --> 03:20:11,200
Like this is like a dangerous level.

7506
03:20:11,350 --> 03:20:12,580
Same thing with Nate Marquardt.

7507
03:20:12,581 --> 03:20:13,960
When Nate Marquardt got popped,

7508
03:20:14,330 --> 03:20:17,320
supposed to fight Rick story and then
he want to fold it fighting Charlie

7509
03:20:17,320 --> 03:20:18,070
Brennan.

7510
03:20:18,070 --> 03:20:19,360
That was last minute replacement.

7511
03:20:19,570 --> 03:20:22,540
It was like they did his levels
then went what the fuck's on?

7512
03:20:22,810 --> 03:20:24,840
Like they ain't no way
you're fighting like this.

7513
03:20:24,841 --> 03:20:25,810
This is not healthy.

7514
03:20:26,020 --> 03:20:29,110
Like you're on some silver
back gorilla levels here.

7515
03:20:29,550 --> 03:20:30,383
Yikes.

7516
03:20:31,750 --> 03:20:32,501
What isn't there,

7517
03:20:32,501 --> 03:20:34,780
aren't there different like
there's free testosterone.

7518
03:20:35,740 --> 03:20:36,460
How does that work?

7519
03:20:36,460 --> 03:20:41,100
Well you'd have to talk to a real total
is free endocrinologist but with you

7520
03:20:41,101 --> 03:20:43,210
know they would explain
what's available to you,

7521
03:20:43,211 --> 03:20:44,470
what your body has to process,

7522
03:20:44,471 --> 03:20:45,280
what you're,

7523
03:20:45,280 --> 03:20:49,600
what your levels are and then they can
also find like it all depends on when

7524
03:20:49,601 --> 03:20:50,790
you've eaten a,

7525
03:20:51,080 --> 03:20:52,540
how much sleep you've gotten.

7526
03:20:53,180 --> 03:20:53,680
Yeah.

7527
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:55,900
If you worked out what kind
of a meal you've eaten,

7528
03:20:56,100 --> 03:20:58,840
depending on like that's why these
blood tests are kind of ridiculous.

7529
03:20:59,080 --> 03:21:00,130
Like I talked to a doctor,

7530
03:21:00,131 --> 03:21:05,131
literally told me if you wanted your
growth hormone levels to show up as low,

7531
03:21:05,830 --> 03:21:08,680
all you would have to do
is eat a really heavy meal.

7532
03:21:08,710 --> 03:21:10,270
Like right before you
got your blood tested.

7533
03:21:10,420 --> 03:21:14,350
I get like how far before he was like 45
minutes an hour should do it and it was

7534
03:21:14,351 --> 03:21:18,160
just eat a bunch of cheeseburgers and
shitty food and fries and milkshakes and

7535
03:21:18,161 --> 03:21:19,030
then just go in there and he goes,

7536
03:21:19,180 --> 03:21:20,560
you'll have such a crash.

7537
03:21:20,980 --> 03:21:21,940
Insulin levels,

7538
03:21:22,630 --> 03:21:23,770
your growth hormone levels,

7539
03:21:23,771 --> 03:21:26,920
everything's going to be all fucked and
out of whack because you just threw some

7540
03:21:26,921 --> 03:21:28,090
sludge in your system.

7541
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:32,530
So how's the best way to check your
true resting testosterone over a week?

7542
03:21:32,920 --> 03:21:33,161
Yeah,

7543
03:21:33,161 --> 03:21:33,851
you should chest it.

7544
03:21:33,851 --> 03:21:34,900
You should get a mean.

7545
03:21:34,930 --> 03:21:35,401
You should try it,

7546
03:21:35,401 --> 03:21:36,550
test it and should be.

7547
03:21:36,580 --> 03:21:39,100
You should write down what you're eating,

7548
03:21:39,700 --> 03:21:41,230
how much you're sleeping,

7549
03:21:41,440 --> 03:21:42,390
and then you know,

7550
03:21:42,460 --> 03:21:43,990
and then also the,

7551
03:21:43,991 --> 03:21:47,540
one of the things that has big effect
on testosterone is how much cholesterol

7552
03:21:47,840 --> 03:21:49,130
and how much saturated fat.

7553
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:51,140
And people for the longest time of course,

7554
03:21:51,141 --> 03:21:52,220
thought it was the opposite.

7555
03:21:52,221 --> 03:21:53,960
They thought that that
stuff is bad for you,

7556
03:21:54,140 --> 03:21:57,710
but now they realize that's actually the
precursors for testosterone and other

7557
03:21:57,711 --> 03:21:58,760
hormones and fat,

7558
03:21:58,761 --> 03:21:59,511
saturated fat.

7559
03:21:59,511 --> 03:22:03,080
Your body needs cholesterol and
saturated fat to convert to testosterone.

7560
03:22:03,320 --> 03:22:06,470
So when one of the things that people
find in John Rollo found this out,

7561
03:22:06,830 --> 03:22:08,300
he was one of the first
people to tell me about this.

7562
03:22:08,301 --> 03:22:11,510
When he switched up to a Keto diet,

7563
03:22:11,900 --> 03:22:13,610
his testosterone went way up.

7564
03:22:13,730 --> 03:22:14,563
He was way up.

7565
03:22:15,860 --> 03:22:16,340
Yeah.

7566
03:22:16,340 --> 03:22:17,173
It happens with a lot of,

7567
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:18,233
yeah.

7568
03:22:18,760 --> 03:22:19,070
Yeah.

7569
03:22:19,070 --> 03:22:20,330
Your insulin levels are very,

7570
03:22:20,331 --> 03:22:20,760
you know,

7571
03:22:20,760 --> 03:22:20,970
your,

7572
03:22:20,970 --> 03:22:21,270
your,

7573
03:22:21,270 --> 03:22:21,571
your,

7574
03:22:21,571 --> 03:22:25,480
your whole state like during the day
changes because you don't have the,

7575
03:22:25,510 --> 03:22:26,570
the crash thing.

7576
03:22:26,690 --> 03:22:31,690
Like last night I ate in
the late afternoon and then
I didn't eat this morning

7577
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:36,410
so I probably went till I have,

7578
03:22:36,411 --> 03:22:41,290
so I had some butter coffee this morning
at like 10:00 AM and I had maybe eating

7579
03:22:41,291 --> 03:22:43,800
at like three in the afternoon along fast,

7580
03:22:44,350 --> 03:22:44,750
fast.

7581
03:22:44,750 --> 03:22:48,960
But it doesn't bother me at all because
of my body's just used to burning fat.

7582
03:22:48,980 --> 03:22:49,310
Yup.

7583
03:22:49,310 --> 03:22:52,640
Oh I had some exogenous ketones to,

7584
03:22:52,641 --> 03:22:54,140
I had some of that like an hour later.

7585
03:22:54,440 --> 03:22:55,350
So your,

7586
03:22:55,360 --> 03:22:55,910
your body,

7587
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:59,690
my body is on full ketogenic state so
I'm just burning the fat all the time.

7588
03:23:00,080 --> 03:23:00,581
And when,

7589
03:23:00,581 --> 03:23:01,580
when you do that,

7590
03:23:01,610 --> 03:23:02,443
you don't have the,

7591
03:23:02,480 --> 03:23:07,480
that weird crazy like I've got to eat
now thing cause if I but allows just

7592
03:23:08,391 --> 03:23:10,700
burning carbohydrates and I took
that much time off of eating,

7593
03:23:10,701 --> 03:23:11,600
I'd be frantic,

7594
03:23:11,840 --> 03:23:15,410
like really frantic and he won't be able
to think and stuff even when my energy

7595
03:23:15,411 --> 03:23:16,131
levels are perfect.

7596
03:23:16,131 --> 03:23:18,050
I did two sets last night at the store.

7597
03:23:18,230 --> 03:23:18,830
Perfect.

7598
03:23:18,830 --> 03:23:19,670
No problems.

7599
03:23:19,970 --> 03:23:20,240
Like,

7600
03:23:20,240 --> 03:23:20,421
yeah,

7601
03:23:20,421 --> 03:23:22,760
when you live off fat it's
wave as opposed to glucose.

7602
03:23:22,761 --> 03:23:22,991
You,

7603
03:23:22,991 --> 03:23:23,680
you definitely,

7604
03:23:23,680 --> 03:23:23,980
your,

7605
03:23:23,980 --> 03:23:26,480
your appetite is way more suppressed.

7606
03:23:26,510 --> 03:23:27,321
Way more suppressed.

7607
03:23:27,321 --> 03:23:27,980
Yeah.

7608
03:23:27,980 --> 03:23:29,750
Just for that benefit alone.

7609
03:23:29,780 --> 03:23:33,560
I like it just that because it keeps me
from thinking about it so much because

7610
03:23:33,561 --> 03:23:34,040
when I'm,

7611
03:23:34,040 --> 03:23:34,540
when I go,

7612
03:23:34,540 --> 03:23:35,570
like I fucked up,

7613
03:23:35,660 --> 03:23:36,470
um,

7614
03:23:36,470 --> 03:23:38,450
maybe a week or so ago,

7615
03:23:38,480 --> 03:23:39,800
not even last weekend.

7616
03:23:39,830 --> 03:23:40,051
Yeah.

7617
03:23:40,051 --> 03:23:40,280
Yeah.

7618
03:23:40,280 --> 03:23:41,113
But we can go,

7619
03:23:41,240 --> 03:23:42,280
I took uh,

7620
03:23:42,320 --> 03:23:44,930
like one Sunday and I went off.

7621
03:23:44,960 --> 03:23:45,740
That's a good time.

7622
03:23:45,740 --> 03:23:46,940
I had pizza,

7623
03:23:46,941 --> 03:23:48,680
I had a Cuban sandwich,

7624
03:23:48,950 --> 03:23:51,830
I ate all this bread and shitty food.

7625
03:23:52,250 --> 03:23:56,510
And then I took me like a few days for
my body to get back into a state of

7626
03:23:56,511 --> 03:23:57,081
ketosis.

7627
03:23:57,081 --> 03:23:59,120
But once I did that man,

7628
03:23:59,180 --> 03:24:04,010
I was so hungry like soon
as my body started flipping
over to the calorie to the

7629
03:24:04,011 --> 03:24:06,650
carbohydrate side because you need
any more glucose because your body,

7630
03:24:06,651 --> 03:24:08,080
you go through glucose very quickly,

7631
03:24:08,720 --> 03:24:10,100
you only have a few hours of it.

7632
03:24:10,101 --> 03:24:11,420
So you have a meal hungry again.

7633
03:24:11,421 --> 03:24:11,661
Yeah.

7634
03:24:11,661 --> 03:24:13,860
Your body is a few hours of it
and then you got to refuel again.

7635
03:24:13,860 --> 03:24:16,100
It's really interesting
too to have to go soon.

7636
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:21,260
So I have a set [inaudible]
store you on tonight too.

7637
03:24:21,290 --> 03:24:21,650
Yup.

7638
03:24:21,650 --> 03:24:22,610
Well whose show is that?

7639
03:24:23,030 --> 03:24:23,863
Uh,

7640
03:24:23,900 --> 03:24:24,081
I,

7641
03:24:24,081 --> 03:24:24,651
it's for,

7642
03:24:24,651 --> 03:24:27,020
it's for an animal rescue
thing and by the way,

7643
03:24:27,050 --> 03:24:28,130
the end of this month,

7644
03:24:28,131 --> 03:24:31,720
March 30 31 April one I'm
at the American comedy camp.

7645
03:24:31,721 --> 03:24:33,130
That has nothing to do with
what we're talking about.

7646
03:24:33,180 --> 03:24:34,240
Some she might date.

7647
03:24:34,250 --> 03:24:35,350
He's just throwing in some plugs.

7648
03:24:35,351 --> 03:24:35,510
Yeah,

7649
03:24:35,510 --> 03:24:35,931
I'll be,

7650
03:24:35,931 --> 03:24:36,870
I'll be in San Diego.

7651
03:24:37,170 --> 03:24:38,060
It's a great club.

7652
03:24:38,150 --> 03:24:38,541
I know.

7653
03:24:38,541 --> 03:24:39,830
That's a fun place to ever do.

7654
03:24:39,831 --> 03:24:40,221
La Jolla.

7655
03:24:40,221 --> 03:24:41,270
Do you do the comedy store down there?

7656
03:24:41,290 --> 03:24:41,830
Not Anymore.

7657
03:24:41,830 --> 03:24:42,481
And I miss her.

7658
03:24:42,481 --> 03:24:43,260
Joe.

7659
03:24:43,260 --> 03:24:43,500
Oh,

7660
03:24:43,500 --> 03:24:44,590
April 27th.

7661
03:24:46,080 --> 03:24:47,220
I'm glad you brought that up.

7662
03:24:47,221 --> 03:24:48,950
So it's amazing finding kid.

7663
03:24:48,960 --> 03:24:50,550
April 8th and ninth,

7664
03:24:50,551 --> 03:24:51,001
DC.

7665
03:24:51,001 --> 03:24:51,480
Philly.

7666
03:24:51,480 --> 03:24:52,313
Oh yeah.

7667
03:24:53,690 --> 03:24:54,523
For one plug to,

7668
03:24:55,200 --> 03:25:00,060
I'm going to be at evolve a slash 10
planets sync Singapore for a week,

03:25:04,320 --> 03:25:04,321
Monday through Friday.

7672
03:25:04,321 --> 03:25:06,750
And then there's a one
fc show on that Saturday.

7673
03:25:06,751 --> 03:25:08,400
It's May 21st,

7674
03:25:08,850 --> 03:25:09,870
all that week,

7675
03:25:10,050 --> 03:25:11,250
two classes a day.

7676
03:25:11,770 --> 03:25:12,540
Uh,

7677
03:25:12,540 --> 03:25:13,560
contact evolve.

7678
03:25:13,561 --> 03:25:14,460
MMA is going to be,

7679
03:25:15,190 --> 03:25:17,010
they're bringing you in to do the,

7680
03:25:17,040 --> 03:25:17,490
um,

7681
03:25:17,490 --> 03:25:20,430
the seminar and then you're going to
stay for the fights and watch the fights.

7682
03:25:20,460 --> 03:25:21,750
I'm doing two classes a day.

7683
03:25:21,751 --> 03:25:24,870
It's like a crazy kid camp seminar week.

7684
03:25:24,930 --> 03:25:26,850
So you're doing that and then
you're gonna stay for the fights.

7685
03:25:26,880 --> 03:25:27,300
Yup.

7686
03:25:27,300 --> 03:25:29,910
One I've seen somebody
should fucking snatch you up.

7687
03:25:29,911 --> 03:25:32,340
Would you be willing to do that thing
that you used to do for the UFC?

7688
03:25:32,550 --> 03:25:34,530
We used to do the scoring
in between rounds.

7689
03:25:36,240 --> 03:25:37,800
I'd rather just lots of fights,

7690
03:25:37,801 --> 03:25:38,450
man.

7691
03:25:38,450 --> 03:25:38,701
I'm going to,

7692
03:25:38,701 --> 03:25:39,660
I'd rather just watch it,

7693
03:25:39,820 --> 03:25:40,531
watch it right here.

7694
03:25:40,531 --> 03:25:40,860
Right.

7695
03:25:40,860 --> 03:25:41,370
I'll do it.

7696
03:25:41,370 --> 03:25:41,491
Like,

7697
03:25:41,491 --> 03:25:42,120
what do I know?

7698
03:25:42,120 --> 03:25:42,481
Come on.

7699
03:25:42,481 --> 03:25:44,880
This is the most fun place in
the house to watch the fights.

7700
03:25:45,030 --> 03:25:48,420
They should give us a booth
ringside and let us fight companion.

7701
03:25:48,950 --> 03:25:52,290
Just just give us the
biggest radio all the time.

7702
03:25:52,560 --> 03:25:54,270
You out to see who would
be paying attention.

7703
03:25:54,271 --> 03:25:56,130
Like if you have those commentary options,

7704
03:25:56,131 --> 03:25:57,480
like you have it on fight pass,

7705
03:25:57,600 --> 03:25:59,190
you could listen to it in espanol,

7706
03:25:59,191 --> 03:26:00,150
you can listen to it.

7707
03:26:00,390 --> 03:26:01,530
You know this should be,

7708
03:26:01,531 --> 03:26:02,460
you go through the corners.

7709
03:26:02,610 --> 03:26:04,110
There should be an option for fight,

7710
03:26:04,200 --> 03:26:05,033
fight companion.

7711
03:26:05,190 --> 03:26:06,680
If we had a fight can pay option.

7712
03:26:06,690 --> 03:26:09,900
We showed up and we showed up
and we had like a fucking smoke,

7713
03:26:09,901 --> 03:26:14,700
poof booth sound proof booth Jamie,

7714
03:26:15,030 --> 03:26:20,030
Jamie up there with like DJ lights and
like a DJ table and a smoke proof room

7715
03:26:21,750 --> 03:26:22,880
and just feels good.

7716
03:26:22,970 --> 03:26:25,470
That'd be crazy.

7717
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:26,580
Do you know going to be,

7718
03:26:27,010 --> 03:26:28,590
the reality is no,

7719
03:26:29,010 --> 03:26:29,910
we're not trying to brag here,

7720
03:26:29,911 --> 03:26:34,350
but the reality is way more people listen
to this then then watch these fights

7721
03:26:34,830 --> 03:26:35,740
and that's true.

7722
03:26:37,830 --> 03:26:38,581
The last one.

7723
03:26:38,581 --> 03:26:38,881
I mean,

7724
03:26:38,881 --> 03:26:39,714
we've gotten,

7725
03:26:39,960 --> 03:26:40,560
you know,

7726
03:26:40,560 --> 03:26:43,470
with youtube and with a iTunes,

7727
03:26:43,471 --> 03:26:47,160
we've got as many as 7 million people
downloading and watching these things.

7728
03:26:47,161 --> 03:26:47,810
Yeah.

7729
03:26:47,810 --> 03:26:48,450
Fuck.

7730
03:26:48,450 --> 03:26:49,220
How much is that?

7731
03:26:49,220 --> 03:26:50,011
I start doing my hair,

7732
03:26:50,011 --> 03:26:53,250
but it's like there's no way
this got 7 million people.

7733
03:26:53,430 --> 03:26:54,870
This may maybe got a million.

7734
03:26:54,871 --> 03:26:55,704
No coffee.

7735
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:56,410
No,

7736
03:26:56,410 --> 03:26:57,243
no.

7737
03:26:57,360 --> 03:26:58,660
This might have got a Fox sports.

7738
03:27:00,240 --> 03:27:01,960
Maybe millions.

7739
03:27:02,010 --> 03:27:03,120
Good million's not bad.

7740
03:27:03,630 --> 03:27:04,290
But here's the thing.

7741
03:27:04,290 --> 03:27:04,411
Well,

7742
03:27:04,411 --> 03:27:07,020
we're not taking into consideration
is how many people watched in Brazil.

7743
03:27:07,021 --> 03:27:08,790
It might be way over a
million because it's veto,

7744
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:09,090
right?

7745
03:27:09,090 --> 03:27:09,661
Oh Shit.

7746
03:27:09,661 --> 03:27:10,440
That straight left.

7747
03:27:10,440 --> 03:27:13,290
Maybe it might be way
over a million in Brazil.

7748
03:27:13,310 --> 03:27:13,471
I mean,

7749
03:27:13,471 --> 03:27:14,910
we're not getting the global numbers,

7750
03:27:14,911 --> 03:27:15,151
right.

7751
03:27:15,151 --> 03:27:18,600
We're getting the fs one numbers as
we hire people to translate this in

7752
03:27:18,601 --> 03:27:19,350
Portuguese.

7753
03:27:19,350 --> 03:27:20,183
No talking.

7754
03:27:20,480 --> 03:27:25,240
Imagine Bravo bright and me and you.

7755
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:28,320
You're the problem is the
humor would translate.

7756
03:27:28,321 --> 03:27:29,460
Someone would fuck up our jokes.

7757
03:27:29,490 --> 03:27:29,731
He goes,

7758
03:27:29,731 --> 03:27:30,630
these guys suck.

7759
03:27:30,700 --> 03:27:31,650
I know this doesn't matter.

7760
03:27:31,651 --> 03:27:33,440
As long as somebody with
a sexy voice to Dub Maine,

7761
03:27:33,610 --> 03:27:33,820
uh,

7762
03:27:33,820 --> 03:27:35,080
know a little about today,

7763
03:27:35,750 --> 03:27:37,530
he just talking into the
microphone in your face.

7764
03:27:37,570 --> 03:27:38,281
I don't know what you're talking about.

7765
03:27:38,281 --> 03:27:38,820
Dare you.

7766
03:27:38,820 --> 03:27:39,810
I'm going to leave on that note.

7767
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:41,980
Let's wrap this bitch up

7768
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:45,160
and we're going to try to do next a
Saturday night or Saturday afternoon,

7769
03:27:45,161 --> 03:27:45,950
two in the afternoon.

7770
03:27:45,950 --> 03:27:46,330
Right there.

7771
03:27:46,330 --> 03:27:47,163
I'm bringing birthday.

7772
03:27:47,340 --> 03:27:48,173
Oh,

7773
03:27:48,340 --> 03:27:49,450
happy birthday cake.

7774
03:27:50,470 --> 03:27:51,070
That's it.

7775
03:27:51,070 --> 03:27:51,680
We've got a lot of,

7776
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:52,810
a lot of podcasts this week.

7777
03:27:52,811 --> 03:27:53,260
See Ya.

7778
03:27:53,260 --> 03:27:53,770
Bye.
