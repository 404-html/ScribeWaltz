1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,900
That fucking turtleneck and it just
blows up like a python with a fucking

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:04,770
sandwich and it's throat.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,070
Hello.
Hello.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,760
Cause you're a disgusting like me.
Right? Rogun is in a different function.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,310
Dusting to

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,760
guys discussed this guys must have a girl

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,580
like fucking you. And she reaches down
and touches your gut and you know,

8
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:30,581
it's just like squishy fucking wet flesh
and as there's no tone to it and like

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,650
listen, think of as you are fucking,
you have to be disgusted by this.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,190
You're not do something on the chip.
You listen.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,200
How do you not care who's touching you?
Fat.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,560
I kill all my own boners
I can't get past how

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,860
disgusting it must be to fuck me to fuck.
I really do.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,810
I I've,

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,450
but sex is not like a driving force
to make me do fucking squats and

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,540
no, no, no, no, no, no. Even if they got
it or they don't know. The point is like,

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,560
how do you not think about how
fucking gross deck you daddy did

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,810
you want your porn?
If you would turn the porn off,

19
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,680
you would admit it. Yes I would. I
would. I would a guy like, listen,

20
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,400
I fucked in the dark.
All right,

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,130
show coming up with muscles
or sunlight behind me.

22
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,840
That fucking movie. Go Fuck
you. So I come in real quick.

23
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,760
I'll bang it when you're asleep.
And I'm one of those guys

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,090
to keep your fucking belly. I fucking
the dark, but they'd feel a fucking,

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,270
we're also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com and then it

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,350
got done with the plug.

27
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,300
Zelda.
We're one more makers of Alpha brain.

28
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,420
We have like actually have
a start thing here. Uh,

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,460
the cognitive enhancing supplement
that I'm giving a Doug, Stan hope,

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,510
Doug Stanhope,

31
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,570
this in your system right now will cure
you of the evil that is the mushrooms

32
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:04,900
because right now your mind
is taken over by an organism,

33
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:08,200
by an intelligent life form.
Thanks dude. Who gave me mushrooms?

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,190
I thought I completely dismissed
the guy at the merch booth.

35
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,060
I think it was giving me a
poster of something. He goes,

36
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:20,320
you want to open that later? And uh, I
go, I should check, get my merge bag,

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
which is scary. When I travel,
I have to scour my merge bag,

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,500
a bag of whatever it might be.
I thought it was a poster.

39
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:33,640
It was a rolled up giant envelope,
but it had mushrooms in it,

40
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:38,470
so I can't travel with them, so I don't
go low. I'm going to fucking either.

41
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:42,760
Usually I just give them away, but I
fucking, I haven't tripped in a year,

42
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,930
so he didn't go and I'm coming to the
Rogan podcast and you're on the Alpha

43
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:50,530
brain. I don't even, yeah, Alpha brain.
I might, let's smoke some pot too.

44
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:54,930
I don't even really that awesome. Later,
later, it'll really fuck this fucking,

45
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,280
I don't know. Might be
good. I have a show tonight.

46
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,980
Let's those washrooms

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,960
and put you on a different fucking
the do. Do. Do you understand?

48
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,560
You're going to go back to
Worcester to the ACLU. Aclu.

49
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,080
That's how deep this is going to fake it.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,190
Are you familiar with what new nootropics
are you ever tried any things? No. No.

51
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,280
I was like basically the loop.
Joe, let's get you in the loop.

52
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:18,220
Duck Stanhope let's get Shannon a little
ducks. Stand up. You need a podcast?

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,750
My friends telling me to. Oh, you should
shop at the Co op instead of Safeway.

54
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,440
That's the fucking, yeah.
Oh, the Co op hip. No,

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,710
I live in a fucking small town. It's
called me and people. They don't,

56
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,060
they're not in the loop. They're
not in the Internet. Well, no.

57
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,900
What's there on the Internet?
It's a global world.

58
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,990
Doesn't need a fucking Internet.
It's just done a 6,000 people.

59
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,570
They yell out the window. Well, that's
what you really are. The Internet,

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,250
because you're in a town of 6,000 people.

61
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,560
You need to be connected with
everything else each other. Well,

62
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,790
that's all good too.
But I mean,

63
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,570
just for sanity's sake and to
keep in the fucking loop. Yeah.

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,410
Well we'll give you some of these,
what's it called?

65
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,430
Alpha brain.
Brain cognitive enhancing our supplement.

66
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:01,630
We also have new mood.
That is a five HTP Sarah time.

67
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,330
I took a three capsules of 0.3 2.4
milligrams of mushrooms on the trip here,

68
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,020
which was at one 30 who
knows how much is it? Well,

69
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,370
you know when you eat a mushroom,

70
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,970
how much of it is like cellulose put
them in capsules. That's what I'm saying.

71
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,550
So let's just cap had a capsule.
So yeah,

72
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:26,260
you might like to see me a fucking
instruction. That's why I was, oh,

73
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:29,090
he did a [inaudible].

74
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,840
It's like a grant per capsule.
If you really look at,

75
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,220
the guy gave me like instructions
on the fucking, well,

76
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,360
we hope that the Alpha brain doesn't
set off. The fuck point is here.

77
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,780
We wanted to send out my own plug.
Thanks guy. Who I completely dismissed.

78
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,340
He looked like so you know,
I have no idea.

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,430
I thought it was giving me
a poster as the universe.

80
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,590
He's just an agent by
the way of the universe.

81
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,430
Some guy that fucking tried
to barge into the green room,

82
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,020
Brian with a tee shirt even.
I won't, I won't plug him.

83
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,880
Go to fucking Joe rogan.net. Click on
the link, entering the code name, Rogan,

84
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,190
and get 10% off your
Alpha brain supplements.

85
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,220
That was one of the best commercials we
ever did. Folks. I know you don't like

86
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,260
commercialization gentleman,
but it's a fucking free podcast.

87
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,770
I know.
They're ridiculous.

88
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,560
The ridiculous.
They need to be edited.

89
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,730
This is a good argument for the
unnecessary having a producer.

90
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,840
All right, I need a real producer.
Yeah, it was fun. She goes,

91
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,790
fun arguments was a fun.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,070
What did you know the difference between
that and that's the fuck you just hit a

93
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:36,210
button and now we're actually talking.
Now it actually is the talking.

94
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,240
I no longer have to promote anything,
but in the beginning,

95
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,940
before we start the way,
the way we got it out of the way,

96
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,930
we used to just talk about the flashlight
all the time and then we figured out

97
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:46,680
once along,
somewhere along the line,

98
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,120
it's best to just get it out of the
way and then go about the podcast.

99
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,490
So that's the, even if it seems a
little disingenuous, but I am just,

100
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,140
it's a vehicle. I'm bit scatterbrained.
Doug, Stan hope on his way over here.

101
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,680
My good buddy. Dunked Stan Hope. Well,
I've not seen in probably like a year,

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,540
a year, somewhere around there.
Yeah, no, it's, it's been a while.

103
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,880
Maybe a year and a half since the last
time I did the show. Yeah, man. Yeah.

104
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,390
Yeah. And when, when let's see your live
show, dude. I learned something I learned.

105
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,670
I don't like going to shows
where I have to stand up. Oh,

106
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:20,940
that was a couple of years ago. That
was, was it fucking Kit Kat club? Yeah.

107
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:23,770
That's like you make years ago. Do
you have people sitting down and, no,

108
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,670
I'm doing it now that I can cut my own
deal. I'm fucking dead back at the Improv.

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,580
Oh, that's nice. Oh, so
they just, they gave up.

110
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,050
They came around.
I can do an off night.

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,540
What's going on with Joey's
microphone, Bro? Oh Mike, I need,

112
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,790
I need fucking buck a lot. They got
all these open mic as Tuesday too.

113
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,160
It's Doug fucking standup.
It's all over.

114
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,000
You've got all these fucking books during
the week. Bring it this fucking savage.

115
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,870
But I can do one night. They're on an
off night and bring my own fucking crowd.

116
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,280
You were one of the first guys who figured
out how to get your own crowd online.

117
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,821
You know,
you,

118
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,080
what you did was really a smart move
by just leaving the comedy clubs almost

119
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,620
completely and just going a little rock
and roll clubs and booking it yourself.

120
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:10,850
And yeah, it was all out
of spite. Spite does,

121
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,350
it drives me a lot. Well, you
really drive, but it was genius.

122
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,940
It was ballsy needing to
fuck these motherfuckers know
you're a voice and you've

123
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,950
got to get the fuck out.
I don't give a fuck what you do.

124
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,080
You don't want to hire me.
I got to keep doing what I do.

125
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,820
It's the best way that you did
it. The best way though. You, you,

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,770
you really found your own audience.

127
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,940
Like you're one of those dudes where
you'd go to see a standup show, you know,

128
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,720
it's a fucking Stan help crowd. We see
him walking down the street, you know,

129
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,900
they're all days from suicide.
They're all small kid.

130
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,720
I was in Calgary where I actually crossed
this. I, I'm looking for the GIG. Oh,

131
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:48,000
that's right. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah,
we talked about this last time.

132
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,930
Wait, Calgary, there's a train
station in front of where the Gig was.

133
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,230
So I see all these fucking
who'd loans standing.

134
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,320
I think that waiting for a train.

135
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:02,990
So I crossed the street to get away from
them and then only to realize that was

136
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:05,630
they were waiting not for the train,
but that was my gig.

137
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,080
That was the fucking queue for my fucking
show that I'm crossing the street to

138
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:14,330
get away from my own fans
cause they seem scary.

139
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,860
That's one of his fans right there.

140
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,390
Look at we're to stand
hosts fans right there.

141
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,070
That's how he shows up with the outfit.

142
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,270
Not Making me look at fucking is
it dude that's on fear factor.

143
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,020
This new season of fear factor.
And there was a thing on CNN, uh,

144
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,930
about uh [inaudible] you
are saying, oh yeah, if I,

145
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,730
if they did fear factor,
I'd suck the Devil's Dick again.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
And then now I'm fucking watching football
and here is [inaudible] he was back

head and my face, I'm 55 inches.

148
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:45,320
A fear factor. I love it though.
They came with the long money,

149
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:48,290
Stan hope they came
with that patient home.

150
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,300
Cash in the middle of the
fucking world falling apart.

151
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
We're way too old for fucking talk about
selling out or all that shit that young

152
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,260
comics care

153

Thank you very much Dane Cook lay.

155
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:06,471

156
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,140

Like fuck thanks. Thanks a
lot. Lee. Who gives a shit?

158
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,240
Someone emailed me today about men.

159
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,580
So hot around and touches on your bit.

160
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:25,581
Like who gives a fuck fucking
internet snipes doing the benefit.

161
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,190
No, he's not. He hasn't done
standup and almost a year

162
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,190
I don't have a clue where I ran
into him at the premiere warriors,

163
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,010
not to name drop. It's on the red
carpet. Avoid the Paparazzi Dang visible.

164
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,280
Like snipey about that. Like yeah.
DANCO well he didn't put the like, uh,

165
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,870
I don't know how Twitter really works,

166
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:47,440
but he said he didn't put the
apostrophe thing in front of it.

167
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:51,540
So he's just telling you your own
fans that he's promoting. Like why?

168
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,620
Oh, I see. I see. I don't know how
Twitter works. Yeah, he didn't put the a,

169
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,970
the apple are just still
sell fucking country.

170
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,160
They're very comfortable old people.
Well,

171
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,400
people are looking for a reasonably
content because they're trying to distract

172
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,320
themselves from a shit
life that they live.

173
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,380
Instead of looking at their life and
trying to fucking figure out their real

174
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:09,160
problems.

175
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,160
They just go online and just fucking
don't give a fuck a comedy anymore.

176
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:17,980
Do you? I care about good colony.
I still live, but I still enjoy it.

177
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,270
I realized somewhere along the line it's
mostly just jealousy and insecurity.

178
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,110
And you know,
one of the realize,

179
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,590
one of the things I realized is that
people have shit way of looking at comedy.

180
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:33,070
When I used to tell people that I'd take
Joey on the road with me, I take people,

181
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:36,880
you know, like, uh, like
who'd you do rascals with?
Oh, Joey Diaz and I, he goes,

182
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:40,490
you bring fucking Joey Diaz on the road.
Like, what are you crazy like you, you,

183
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:45,010
you follow Joey Diaz on purpose. And I
was like, and I couldn't understand it.

184
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,720
I was like, why would you even think
like that? Like why does everybody,

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,750
everybody's worried at every moment
that they're not the life of the fucking

186
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:56,140
party. Like at every moment they can't
even enjoy when other people are funny.

187
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:59,860
I'm like, you don't want to be around
funny people. That's all I want to do.

188
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,320
I want guys to fucking crush in front
of me. You know, I want, I want to just,

189
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,740
I want the whole thing to be fun.

190
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,950
I don't want to just be the only
one who's having fun up there.

191
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:12,790
Spoiled socially because yeah,

192
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:17,410
my fucking best friends in the world.
Literally the funniest people alive.

193
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,540
So spoiled. So if you try to hang out
with the idiots, go to your fucking,

194
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,870
the in laws are so shit udo

195
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,670
when they tell you you could do this
joke on stage, they don't understand.

196
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,980
They don't see if feel like
it, you know, when I was,

197
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,900
I was dating this girl one time,
she's a nice girl,

198
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:35,080
but I was at a transitionary point in
my life. There's nothing bad about her.

199
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:38,440
She was just who she was. Was young
girl, want to do what you want to do.

200
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,700
She was always upset. She was, she's a
good girl. She was a really good person.

201
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,660
But she was always upset that I was
doing other things and I was hanging out

202
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,610
this pool hall all the time and she
would always give me shit about it.

203
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,050
But you know,
I finally,

204
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:53,080
I had to have a sit her down and have
a moment like I have fucking fun.

205
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,700
You don't understand. Again, I have
to remind people I'm tripping a bit.

206
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:02,701
Just picturing you at a pool hall is a
flashback in a movie and weird hair on

207
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,700
a full head of it.
Back to Joe Rogan and pool hall days back.

208
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,830
No, it wasn't in Boston. It was New York.

209
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,760
I became obsessed when I first moved to
New York, but, uh, she, she hated it.

210
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:21,280
She fucking hated it because I never
wanted to hang out with her and I would

211
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,830
tell her, look, you know,
and I had a conversation with
him like, look, you're a,

212
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:26,020
you're a very cool person.
You're very sweet. I don't,

213
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,490
I don't want to date another girl,

214
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,400
but I don't want to fucking hang out
with you every day. Well you hate chicks,

215
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,410
that's all. Hey checks.
I hate dumb ones though.

216
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,000
I hate dumb dudes and I hate dumb
checks equally, it's not a gender thing,

217
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,720
it's just dummies. But when you're in that
situation, man, when you're just like,

218
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:44,140
God, I just can't, I can't hang out with
you all the time. It's, it hurts me.

219
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
It hurts me to know that there's
all this fun going on over there.

220
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm hanging out with you and these dudes
are gambling is staying up to three in

221
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,900
the morning and no one's married.

222
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,370
No one knows what the fuck
is going on the next day,

223
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,100
they're all wild gambling motherfuckers
and they're my friends and they're funny

224
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,250
and they say funny shit and I'm like,
what am I going to do?

225
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,780
I'm going to hang out with you
and what are you going to tell me?

226
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,780
Like what movies you like? Well, you
didn't tell me what you like to eat.

227
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,350
You know what your mom said. That was
mean. You know, she's just fucking Christ.

228
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,470
I want to go have fun. Yeah, no,

229
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,630
I think go ahead. Are you to
foreground? I hate to fucking, I'm talk.

230
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,340
No, no, I'm good. I'm good. I was
just hit a roadblock. Cramping.

231
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:25,210
My mind is so important to have friends
that are fun. You know, it's the, the,

232
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:28,960
the one thing that you, you know, you get
out of the podcasts and shit too though.

233
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:32,530
These like people that don't know anybody,
like you don't know anybody like Joey,

234
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,290
they get to talk to you
essentially on a podcast.

235
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,410
They get to kind of feel your vibe,
see how you think about things.

236
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,860
When you sit down and see somebody talk
for an hour, you don't just see him talk.

237
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,740
You see how they think and you
see how they decipher stuff.

238
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,000
And it kind of can give you insight on
how maybe you're not doing it that way.

239
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:51,670
Or maybe you could, you could do it
that way and it would enhance your shit,

240
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,820
you know? Right. It's so important, man.

241
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:59,020
You can get stuck in a fucking bad place
with bad friends. Are you freaking out?

242
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,280
No,
not freaking out.

243
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:05,281
I'm just enjoying the entire
experience led Zeppelin's on the wall.

244
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,730
We've got this new studio for the folks
who are just listening on iTunes. If you,

245
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:13,540
uh, go to Ustream. Dot.
TV Ford Slash Joe Rogan,

246
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,730
you could watch all these now and uh,

247
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:20,731
we actually have it set up where
we have fucking TV on delay.

248
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,090
Yeah. Weird. Huh? I should not look
in that direction. I did that for you,

249
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,050
so you can,
you know,

250
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,860
it'd be one of my favorite stat hopes
stories that I tell is when you and I did

251
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,340
mushrooms and then we,
uh,

252
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,170
went out to the desert and it was the
day the war started watching pregame for

253
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,180
the war. I'll never,
I'll never forget this.

254
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,920
You and I were sitting in young Urban's
living room, twisted to our balls, right?

255
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,760
And they had a fucking giant
kettle of some kind of Iowasca.

256
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:46,930
They were trying to produce this,

257
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:50,000
how many of them as scary and it give
us just a weird feeling and ahead.

258
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,010
It didn't get us off
at all. Nothing. And I

259
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,870
had like,
I felt like a pop or like I like,

260
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,240
but I'll tell you what I bag of mushrooms
in my pocket and then I'd come in and

261
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:04,241
they have this whole fucking giant
kettle going but the two of them together

262
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,310
though, I think that's what really
blasted it off. And you know,

263
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,790
that's what they think Soma
was. They think some of them
might've been, you know,

264
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,940
Soma for my ancient Hindu religion,
they don't know what it is.

265
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:17,810
But it was like the basis of a lot of
their belief in a lot of their, their,

266
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:18,820
you know,
their,

267
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,660
their ancient scriptures talk about it
and like grieve about Soma and they think

268
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:23,991
that it was,

269
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:28,460
am Anita miscarry and mushrooms mixed
with cubensis mushrooms like mixed like

270
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:33,110
that. And that might have been because we
were, we were fucking Alasta rude dude.

271
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,041
We,
I was,

272
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,900
I remember staring at the wall and
looking at this crazy geometric pattern of

273
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:41,470
the universe was made out of and
staying home, watching to the war.

274
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,380
It's like fucking, but
you go, this is what you,

275
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:48,230
you were standing there and you go,
holy shit is fucking, what's his name?

276
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:52,700
Frank Kelly Endo.
Do it and deploying it in picks as

277
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,210
I give you my pigs as John Madden who
hasn't been relevant for fucking seven

278
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,400
years.
We're sitting there blasted,

279
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,940
and I'll never forget this
because you just go, Holy Shit,

280
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:09,320
there's a fucking kick off
kickoff to the kickoff.

281
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,010
And we were, we were both like
really just starting a trip,

282
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,740
like it was just coming on
and then you go, Holy Shit,

283
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,010
there's a kickoff at six and we were
sitting, we just sat down at 45 we,

284
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:24,110
you get a cocktail of snacks.
We sat down, we were like,

285
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:27,660
Terry Bradshaw is going to fucking
come on and tell you how he feels.

286
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,730
It's like it's the strangest
time ever to be alive.

287
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,230
What kind of a world is this telling us?
The war coverage begins at five.

288
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,950
What are you saying? They timed it.
You told me they timed it. They waited.

289
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,420
Isn't it like a different time over there?

290
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,350
So they waited all day and it's not
like it was their time, but yeah,

291
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,850
it was primetime here.

292
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,850
Six in the afternoon to imagine if they
actually timed the missiles to prime

293
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:58,770
time in America. Probably had finally
fucking date. Probably fucking

294
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,360
fucking fucking advertisers.
God.

295
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,330
Well you know George Bush if uh,
yeah, three, three in the morning,

296
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:12,030
you know their time. Yeah. Sizzler.

297
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,450
We can get fucking tied to sponsor
it. If you're going to, you know,

298
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,120
new commit six who was such
a strange fucking moment man.

299
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,230
What a weird moment. Stand hope. Remember
those two broads? I live next to you

300
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,720
with a tall German chick that was
lanky and Q and a short Brunette.

301
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,920
And then there was the, the Chubby
at CIC, sage member. The cello.

302
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,290
Oh those are the,
yeah.

303
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,840
You did like heroin or something with
them or something off. I did everything.

304
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,510
I stopped.
I stopped the sages.

305
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,220
The one I did like sage's father,
I one time was the rolling stones'

306
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,053
manager.

307
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,660
And what he did for this chick was he
bought her a fucking blockbuster and

308
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:59,610
Ventura blockbuster. And she said, I don't
want to block. Turned her on to heroin.

309
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,390
And she was herpes herpes.

310
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,350
I didn't give him no fucking hurt because

311
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,050
she was giving me shit about having,

312
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,260
but she's over there and fucking Oh,
heroin with Joey Diaz to me,

313
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
I was homeless.

314
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,240
So she would come to the store on Sundays.

315
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,630
She would come to the store on Sundays
and give me pills and she would,

316
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,960
she was an expert in mixing. What was
that shit? That was big year MDB a

317
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,780
acts to see what white water she drinking,
none of that other stuff. Oh, Ghp.

318
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,430
And she bring it to the comedy store
and I'd be hosting on Sundays and she'd

319
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,290
give me drinks of the GSP,
whatever the fuck.

320
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,290
So this happened,
this one off for six months,

321
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,590
she'd take HB and Sundays
I go to a house broken,

322
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,310
like go to a house on Sundays
after I'd host, she come down,

323
00:18:56,311 --> 00:19:01,200
we buy coke from chewy. We'd go to
Ralph's, we do heroin, eat her ass pills.

324
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,890
She has to fake little
shows that lingerie for me.

325
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,920
She was a hundred pounds overweight,
but this bitch ass, he want to eat. No,

326
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,893
no,

327
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,570
I didn't see it for a long time.
Right.

328
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,050
Then she started coming
around to Calistoga,

329
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,840
Tsp and so one fuck Liz is a great story.

330
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:24,150
I just got him up cause I was thinking
about staying hope on the way up here.

331
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,510
And uh,
our friend Mike was selling weed,

332
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,760
but then one time he worked
at CAA and he goes, listen,

333
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:31,710
one of the interns older than me blew up.

334
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,850
He ended up being Whitney
Houston's manager and you know,

335
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,310
and the tour manager and
he's looking for powder.

336
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,230
So everyday they would come over and
I would sell Bobby Brown and Whitney

337
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,680
Houston, you know, they would come over
like $1,100, which was pretty diem money.

338
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,350
I was taking Whitney's per diem money,
right?

339
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,710
Every day they come out with a little
white envelope and give me the per diem

340
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:56,690
money and I go up to the Martell
cartel and I'd buy 14 grams of Blo.

341
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,900
Take an eight ball out and cut it and
then give it to Whitney Houston and they

342
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:04,140
were fucking going crazy. They,
this went on for 30 40 days,

343
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,860
but I couldn't snort all the blog was,
I couldn't store it.

344
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:12,190
It was just too much. So I was giving
it to Maldon Martinez, the whole,

345
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,110
she's dead.
That's the coke that killed her.

346
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,240
So
I got,

347
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,780
I got like two ounces of block plus I
snorted all this coke and I can't smell it

348
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:29,490
no more. I called him back. I go mountain,

349
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,590
bring the club down to the fucking store.
Right.

350
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,900
I'm selling coke to Whitney fucking dad
picking me up at nine in the morning,

351
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:40,620
paging me on the Red Pager. I'm coming
downstairs, getting in the car with them,

352
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:44,730
going to the Martell cocktail to the
brothers going in the house with two grams

353
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:48,670
of coke already cut my pocket.
And I would just go and take rocks out,

354
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,010
throw the cut and mix it up and
give it right back to them, the car,

355
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,030
and they'd be happy as shit.

356
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,430
They were invited me to a and m records
to come party with them. I don't party.

357
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,970
I was selling them.

358
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,240
I was getting him a half ounce and
taking an eight ball out and throwing an

359
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:04,150
eight ball to cut it. What does an
eight ball? Three and a half grams.

360
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,180
I haven't done coke my entire fucking
life and I don't know like a percentage,

361
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,800
like what it cost. Percentages
are. Isn't that crazy

362
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,720
sleazy that it's all cut

363
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,130
though with a fucking shit like
coke because someone goes, Hey,

364
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,350
do you want to do a
bump? And you go, okay,

365
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,520
but you don't know what he's never bought.
When you go out with Stan,

366
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,180
hope somebody got cokes, he'll do
coke. You got an elephant tranquilizer.

367
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,370
Stan hopes like to go. We don't give
a fuck. The train's already running.

368
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,770
I got nowhere to be tomorrow. Fuck it.
We're here. We're ready. You know what?

369
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:44,500
I got here and he said he had mushrooms.
I'm like, what the fuck you don't.

370
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,010
You should.

371
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,850
This is the cock sucker and knocks on
your door with rolling papers and no weed.

372
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,070
You know what I'm saying?
Like I've got no rule like rolling papers.

373
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,100
Next time you bring those fucking
mushrooms with you and we could have been

374
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,860
right here on this would have been a
great fucking podcast not to listen.

375
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,970
So I'm Robyn Whitney and Bobby
Brown for a fucking month.

376
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:04,330
I'm robbing that blow every day. I
can't do it. I can't snort it fast.

377
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,760
How much are they doing?
They're doing a half ounce a day.

378
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,580
This is why this is not
this. No, this is not da.

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,160
They're doing a half ounce a day, which
is three ounces a week. Oh my God.

380
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,560
And singing. What does that look
like? Whoa. Announces like this,

381
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,360
like a half ounce of weed.
Like God, they're doing,

382
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,590
they're doing one of those a day.
Got Bobby Brown, his face twisted,

383
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,460
and I was getting the shit that
was flaky. So my gosh, right?

384
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,870
I tell Marilyn and bring the
would, well, aren't they?

385
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,000
Aren't they feeding and entourage
at this point about coke?

386
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,140
It's just those two. Oh, there's only so
much coke left. All right, you gotta go.

387
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:45,760
You gotta go. You gotta go. Right?

388
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,630
So this went on so and salary and they
called Maryland Martinez. I go, Maryland.

389
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:50,140
Do me a favor,

390
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,870
bring the blow to the comedy store
cause I'm just going to sell it.

391
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,470
And a kid after my set gives me a little
Baggie with the bottom of it filled up

392
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,340
like not even, not even two lines. And I
put it in my pocket and I take it home.

393
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:08,320
When I get home I do it. It's not
coke, it's crank. So I'm on fire now.

394
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,660
It's three in the morning.
I'm in my house on fire.

395
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,740
I got the coke kid who hasn't
stopped shaking since. All right.

396
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,950
I have the coke and the fucking
car. No, I'm not. I'm not bouncing.

397
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,160
I have the coat in the car.
I always do that shit.

398
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:24,340
I have the coat in the car right.
And I wouldn't bring it upstairs.

399
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,570
I don't like coke in my house.

400
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,280
So I would go down and do a little
bump by five in the morning.

401
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,390
You would always keep it in the car
and the car ride height. I don't like,

402
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,220
I don't like him.
I don't want to be parents,

403
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,380
but I don't like it in my house anyway.
I never like coconut. It's just bad.

404
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,323
I don't like it.

405
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,770
I used to leave it outside on the rocks
and somebody else's garage and then I'm

406
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:44,710
would go in and do a bump
and go back upstairs.

407
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,850
So there's one night I got upstairs and
the pages going off and it's sage and I

408
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:53,780
said fuck it. Let me just
bring the two ounces to our
house, a blow. And I brought,

409
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,600
at that time it was like an ounce
and a half and three quarters.

410
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,520
This bitch picked me up at six in the
morning with a case of Starbuck coffee in

411
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,110
Canada,
half a gallon of vodka.

412
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,830
And we went back to the house and we
did that whole package of blo heroin,

413
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,470
Valliant and BMA a GSP.

414
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,160
We did how many days? How
many days? Whole days.

415
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,940
One day afternoon I had to
get Scott Wolfe, Josh moves,

416
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,500
brother Frey though to come get me
over by the directors guild. Oh my God.

417
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:28,670
Two days I puked till Thursday.
Jesus Christ is how sick I was.

418
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,390
The fucking Houston's kept calling me
and I'm like, fuck you motherfuckers.

419
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:36,140
I'm out of commission. Right. So
finally that next week was the grammys.

420
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,580
This is the last time I seen them.

421
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,420
I don't think I told you about this
last time ever. I seen Whitney Houston.

422
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,740
I got a call on a Monday morning after
the grammys at nine in the morning and

423
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:48,590
they're like, it's your boy up.
He would have to be come get me,

424
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,790
and they pull up to my fucking house
where I live by the YMCAs and it was the

425
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,624
manager,

426
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Whitney Houston and Ricky Martin in
the fucking back and they're all gone.

427
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,730
They're gone from the Grammy's that jaw,
all of them. Jaws are fucking going.

428
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,540
Jack and I got in the car with them.

429
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,860
I drive for the Martell caught
tell him sitting there like, oh,

430
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,520
I don't even know what drinking,
and I just looked out the window.

431
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:13,520
I was more paranoid than he
was. I got in, bought it,

432
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:17,720
brought it back to the college. That's
the last time I fucking said, wow. She,

433
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:20,300
they went out of town after that. They
were here to sing. They were doing,

434
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,580
this had to be 98 97 99 they would go
with the soundtrack to this James Bond.

435
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,580
I Wyclef Jean who just robbed half
a fucking Haiti. That cock sucker.

436
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:35,060
That's why I'm 80 you didn't see that
he robbed his own fucking earthquake

437
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:39,390
relief. Fun? No, that
million dollar. Yeah, Bro.

438
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,640
That's why I don't send it unless I
see the guy on the street bleeding.

439
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,720
I give them money.
When you send $100 they get 30 of it.

440
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,260
Did you steal my change jar in
the late nineties probably did.

441
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,710
Fucking change jar.

442
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,710
What's a change jar by the
head changing bluejeans.

443
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:01,760
Talking about Robert.
Yeah.

444
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,610
He was just thinking about the nineties
where we lived on curse on it and there

445
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:08,670
was a fucking change. Our
Ego. That probably is fucking,

446
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,770
I called you Joey jingles for awhile.
No, no. I would never write change.

447
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,870
Rob something.
No,

448
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,460
it was someone who just fucking
calling a fucking cup of cheese. Yeah.

449
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:22,580
It was just a weird thought.

450
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,140
I smoked pot, which I never do. The fuck
is wrong with you. I'm a professional.

451
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,600
Yeah. Now I remember calling in Seattle.

452
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:40,280
What time? I was opening up for a stay
at home and I picked them up in an Rv.

453
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,230
It was snowing in Seattle.
Help. Weird chick copy Carol,

454
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,020
who I stuck the fucking a little bit
before Perez. He was around for that.

455
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,870
He knew all about that
shit. Seattle. He Brian,

456
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,290
you shouldn't probably played copyrighted
shit on the background like this. No,

457
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,390
I'm not just playing old shit.
All right with that,

458
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm looking at all these images. Probably
not fucking start defamation suits.

459
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,270
That's a definition.
It's Reiki.

460
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:06,650
Fucking Martin waters is a
two story would definitely,

461
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,700
if it didn't fucking happen,
they wouldn't give it up.

462
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,120
You Martin clean and sober now he
came out of the closet, has got kids.

463
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,660
So he'll look these opinions and stories
and not a representative of the Joe

464
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,370
Rogan and all that.
What the fuck is,

465
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,400
I was actually promoting copyrighted
stuff and what is the [inaudible] on this

466
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,880
story might think that you,
the vigils date,

467
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,980
the bucket on this story's
going to get on the Internet.

468
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,710
Years ago wasn't, he wasn't
going to say to me, no,

469
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:38,790
you remember be bitch the
fuck sing bitch St lets us,

470
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,530
I kept her alive for three fucking months
given all those rob Tam rocks and shit.

471
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,490
So you think it was just them
doing that amount? Joe Rogan,

472
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,470
if you could go crazy,

473
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:52,590
you got a check that's sucking your
dick ain't got no experience with this.

474
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,360
Fuck you want, I don't, I don't have
any experience. We have a fucking shame.

475
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,070
Jesus Christ.

476
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,600
No, no, no. I just noticed the fucking,

477
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,790
all the change had been taken out
and nothing else was stolen. I go,

478
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,930
who would do that? And I go,
I think Joey's back on drugs.

479
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,550
Maybe you fucking psycho. Oh, it's
impossible. Joey. You might've done it.

480
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:18,151
Forgot about it.

481
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:22,220
I think the last time I went to stay
in hope sound like I had an open house

482
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,160
policy. He had an open house policy.
Still do. Like who would just like,

483
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,260
I was just going, this is the fucking
like 1996 we were all broke. I'm going,

484
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,530
which one of my friends would
be broken off to just fucking,

485
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,120
I ever thought of you.

486
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,190
I was at the coach and horses dangles out
of my fucking mind and I couldn't walk

487
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:45,750
to uh, Vista. So I went to standalone
was cause he had the open door policy.

488
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,090
And I go to stay in hopes, I hope with
go. He's got the bunk beds. I get no,

489
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,990
this time it was the living room.
He just had a cut.

490
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,750
I get out of the car cause I couldn't
even make it to the fucking bed.

491
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,340
That's like there's an earthquake and I
wake up to the house and they opened my

492
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:02,250
eyes sideways and I see the clock.
So I'm focusing on the clock,

493
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,270
but the fucking earth is moving, you
know what I'm saying? And that was just,

494
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,910
that's I think the last time I was.
Do you still have that apartment?

495
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,460
It's subsidized. You have
somebody's rent control I to fuck.

496
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,870
I still live there all the time.

497
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,500
I still beat the horn when
I go by like a motherfucker.

498
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,950
I respect that Hennigan's there
now town. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,540
Do you ever Miss La? Yeah. Now. Yeah.

500
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,870
Right now the fucking drive here
was horrific. I was going to change.

501
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,580
I was trying to get ahold of you.

502
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,540
If we have to do this the next
day I'm going to change my flight.

503
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,350
I'm like I can just fly.
I can fucking 10 days off.

504
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,130
I'll just fly of fucking somewhere.

505
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,610
I never do that.
Just fly somewhere for a vacation.

506
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:46,270
I had my passport in Costa Rica.

507
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,510
If I'm going to extend my stay
here to fucking hang out with you,

508
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,060
I'll probably be fucked up when I leave.
Why not?

509
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,540
And then just the thought of lax
fucking ruined that entire fantasy.

510
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,290
Really? Oh, sorry. He's going to talk
down here. No, it was perfect. All right.

511
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,960
That's fine. Well, my audio
functions are way fucked.

512
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,840
Oh yeah. Um, medicinally.
You know what I'm,

513
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,820
why did you move there in the first place?
Why did you decide to,

514
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,510
you live in Bisbee Arizona in the
middle of nowhere, right? What was the,

515
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,020
just wanted to get away and Paul's by ice,

516
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,560
the place I've found when I was driving
on the road, I really impulse buy. Yeah.

517
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,130
I don't even see the inside. Did you
know anything about the town pictures?

518
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,590
Did you know anything about the
town? I had been there a lot. Sorry.

519
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,750
I had a fucking, it's
fine dude. Yeah, yeah. No.

520
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:42,110
Alright dude. Dude, dude, dude, dude.

521
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,690
[inaudible] so, um, yeah.
So what's the downside?

522
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,080
What's the downside of living
in a tiny little town like that?

523
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,390
Cause you're in like a town of like what?
6,000 people or something crazy. Yeah.

524
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:56,740
Jake Lamata has come over to that house
a couple times. Jake Lamata the fighter.

525
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,030
Yeah. Really? Yeah. The Guy who they
made the movie regionally bull about.

526
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,520
What's that guy like? Uh, you know what?
I could do a fucking 20 minute bit.

527
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,320
That's the downside. Like he,
he lives there. Yeah. Yeah. No,

528
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:14,500
but you have to be respectful
of people there because

529
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,350
any good story that comes out of there,
of course your neighbor.

530
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,620
That's the downside to
living in a small team. Yeah.

531
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,310
You can't talk about half the fucking
stop sign because they cut you off.

532
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:31,630
Cause that guy will be behind you
in line it fucking Safeway. Yeah.

533
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:34,390
Like how often you run in the same
people over and over again. All the time.

534
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,120
All the time. Yeah. That's a
weird thing, huh? I go, yeah.

535
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:41,230
You get a fucking really funny
fucking bit about your neighbor.

536
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,370
So do you guys think that Joey is take
care of this change real quick? No,

537
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,910
I don't think she didn't see there's this
spot. Here's a spot on the microphone.

538
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:49,970
If I was,
it doesn't matter.

539
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,580
I was looking for it like I was to your
voice on where do you want not to me.

540
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,780
Not to you really? It sounded fucked. I
think it's probably those headphones. No,

541
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,270
no. Yeah, no. It's because of
my senses are peaked. Right?
So what's the good side?

542
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,040
There's gotta be a good side.
You know, I fucking love it.

543
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,810
One of the bad sides is I eat the road
now because I want to be home. Really?

544
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,760
And now you have a lot of
friends fucking joy in Cleveland.

545
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:20,020
Like what am I going to accomplish
that I haven't in 21 years? Same thing.

546
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,450
I'm going to fuck bro.

547
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,460
Soft cock at a younger girl all
night until she's diluted enough.

548
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:29,380
What are we going to do
with fucking triple run?

549
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,020
Let's do a triple run old
school. Take red band. The drive.

550
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,770
I'd fucking love to do that.
We did our 10 year anniversary.

551
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,980
Yeah. Becker and I, when
we did, you know, 10 years

552
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,760
from now we're going to go back and we
were going to do a Tribble run triple

553
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,570
runs are these legendary one
nighters in the northwest.

554
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:50,840
I forget where on radio we should
probably eat fucking entertain or some no,

555
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:55,610
this isn't attaining. Oh yeah,
yeah. But uh, uh, so you'd go,

556
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:58,340
you'd play Idaho falls.

557
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,210
That's where I met Joey Coco Diaz
Dribble Gig. I was in boulder,

558
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:05,930
Colorado was a host at the boulder broker,
the joker broker,

559
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,860
the joker broker and he came out on a
Tuesday and the ride driver's license for

560
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:12,440
a long time because I would live
down the road. I didn't have a home,

561
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:16,190
was the fucking joker brokers
address in Boulder, Colorado.

562
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,880
I got a Colorado license,
Kessler, Mike Kessler's house.

563
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:23,760
You bought the car from my Kessler. Oh,
that's right. Piece of shit. That's right.

564
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,680
You bought, yeah. That fucking dodge
neon forever. Jay Morph fucking,

565
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,750
yeah. Spotted me in the, uh,

566
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,810
parking lot of the comedy store in the
late nineties and said, ah, dodge neon.

567
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,673
Yeah.

568
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,270
He had some condescending thing where
I'm good for the environment or so what a

569
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:45,720
cunt that guy is. But we met Olga.

570
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,690
Broker run was Tuesday in boulder,

571
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,660
then you had Wednesday off and
then you had Thursday in Craig,

572
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,770
Colorado Friday and uh,

573
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,990
some other Gunnison and it ended up in
Colorado Springs at some fucking bond.

574
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,280
So Tuesdays you had to come to boulder
and I became friends with Doug and then

575
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:03,680
Wednesday you had off. So it was
going to happen with stay at a hotel.

576
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,160
He stayed at my house. That's when my
wife and I first broke up was a Congo.

577
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,420
That's when I first met him.

578
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,660
He was still telemarketing in
Vegas the second time he came back,

579
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:15,640
it just done evening at the Improv.
Yeah. Yeah. And you stayed again.

580
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:17,810
And that's how we became friends.
I didn't see him again.

581
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,180
He Won San Francisco and he came
up to Seattle and then I thought,

582
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,320
well it's fun when you go on one of
those gigs and you meet a real comic,

583
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,160
you know, cause he, you never know what
Joey, Joey came into the joker broker.

584
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:32,600
He was like the house,
but he didn't give a fuck.

585
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,580
You're like, hi, I'm the comic, and
he's like, I know, and he goes on stage.

586
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,410
I just had the fucking push
me pull you like that's it.

587
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:45,380
That's how I remember he was doing a bit
about having the shits and the vomits

588
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:49,640
at the same time, but you
knew it was honest because
you can tell by Joey's face.

589
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:51,440
He was fucking sick person.

590
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,540
He was like sweating profusely and it
was about having the push me pull you

591
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,030
shit, trying to figure out which
end to aim towards the toilet.

592
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,150
I got $50 a show and I would pull you,

593
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,750
I would take a hundred valiums and sell
them all for $3 a piece and I would make

594
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:10,310
$50 a show on a steak.

595
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,020
It was steak tonight and I had to go up
every Tuesday for the same 80 people and

596
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:16,910
do new material every fucking Tuesday,

597
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:20,660
so I'd have to get the bolt of paper
and write five minutes and no place to

598
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:24,080
practice. I didn't know about
that. I thought you just
wrote it and brought it up.

599
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,270
They're like, you know,
and it was the same people.

600
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:30,050
And I remember that if you got them
to lift their head up while they were

601
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:32,930
cutting into the state, that they
just paid six 95 four, you know,

602
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:33,860
those type of people.

603
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,070
That was their thing on Tuesdays
to comics and the state for $14

604
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,860
or whatever the fuck it was.
You know. But it's amazing how,

605
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,890
that's how I got into comedy.
If you could get them to look at you,

606
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,560
you did your job and get a
Gig once from Mike Clark,

607
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,550
Clark's brother Mike Clark is a great guy.

608
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:54,480
Lenny Clarke is one of
the legendary comedians of
Boston, a fucking awesome guy.

609
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,680
And Mike used to book me on a lot of
road gigs back in the Boston days and one

610
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:01,410
of them, he booked me. It was
the waiting room of a restaurant.

611
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,650
So it was as your people
are waiting to be seated,

612
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,050
they have like a room
where they all sit down.

613
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:10,110
I don't know why they didn't just make
that part a part of the restaurant too.

614
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:13,380
It was real weird. But they had a
band and then they had a comedian.

615
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,100
So these people are just sitting around
waiting and you can just go up and start

616
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:21,930
talking about blowjobs and taking shits
or whatever stupid act I had at the

617
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,990
time. And as I'm talking like
I'm in the middle of a bit,

618
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,220
right about the hit the punchline and
over the PA system that I'm using,

619
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,510
it's like Johnson Party of
two, your table's ready,
please come to the front desk.

620
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,500
And I'm like, oh no. It
was the same sound system.

621
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,130
So every time when you were on stage you
could be in the middle of talking and

622
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,860
they would just start announcing people's
names and it would happen like every

623
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:47,640
15 seconds. It was the most
ridiculous Gig of all time.

624
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,020
And I replaced a host that was a magician
that came out with a bird on stage,

625
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,940
but the bird will, we get stuck on
the lights and he would shit on.

626
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,140
So they had a fire him. That's
who I replaced. That's how my,

627
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,880
that's how my comedy career

628
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,940
and I'll never forget when I seen the
parrot or whatever, it was shit on him.

629
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,540
I went right to the manager on my dog.

630
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,630
Cause you've got the hosting
job was the winner of the,

631
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,750
of the Beck's comedy
competition. Beck's beer. Right.

632
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,230
And that's how I want the more popular
than that brand of beer right now.

633
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,800
What happened there? Beer. How can that
be? We're never caught on, I still,

634
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:28,780
I still drink Becks. Yeah. Some stanky
to it backs. It was like a little,

635
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,160
if they're out of Heineken you'll get it
back out again. Yeah, I'll take it. But

636
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,640
you just make it tastes like Heineken.
Remember honey brown.

637
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:41,140
It was really popular and like the like
nine early nineties you were a kid.

638
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,190
What do you think sells more bex
or Heineken. Heineken. Right.

639
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,650
I think it got commercials running.
Is that what it is? I guess so.

640
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,830
That's got a lot of commercials do.
I haven't seen banks.

641
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,150
I've been out of bex in forever.
Maybe I'm just prejudice.

642
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,110
Maybe I need to drop the bags.
Go get me a bag.

643
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,890
You are pretty prejudice with beer though.

644
00:37:56,891 --> 00:37:58,840
I've noticed just from being in
comedy clubs, you're always like,

645
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:01,870
what the fuck is that? Why
aren't you drinking that?
You've got to get man's beer.

646
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:05,680
Like Sam Adams just started drinking
those little light fairy drinks. I'm like,

647
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:07,210
that's not really a beer.
Goddammit.

648
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,910
I tried to give me a fucking light
beer outta here, bitch. No light beer,

649
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,450
Sam Adams
beer that I like his ass.

650
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,640
Fuck yes.
They light up a mass.

651
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,580
Stella's and uh,
saint man,

652
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,310
Yo, we're going to handle the mass. And
it was at the club night grilled 93.

653
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,980
Oh yeah.
And then so there's three at that time I

654
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,510
hadn't followed Joey d. No, no,
no. It is on fire. There's a,

655
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:43,240
there's always nobody
with a mullet. Oh, please.

656
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,110
And he went up on stage in the middle of
his set as a priest walked by and stand

657
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,210
hopes. He's in my little corner of
his eye and he goes, hey father,

658
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:50,770
where are you going?
I got a tip.

659
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:54,700
Fuck Joe going to blow your fucking
socks off the whole fucking room.

660
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,460
Like just shit.
The priests just ran out of that

661
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,280
motherfucker Maguire. That's who it was.
I think that that might've been who I,

662
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:07,210
cool. I call, I call me you
and Chris Mcguire and beer
joing at that dot. I'm good.

663
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,044
We did.

664
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,000
The priest was there with my dad that
we did at [inaudible] on Friday night,

665
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,160
but we did grow 93 on Saturday night.
That's where I end up that way.

666
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,770
Or not monster fucking,
I was booed off stage.

667
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:27,250
I got booed off stage where I followed a
Jim brewer wants yeah. Nanuet New York.

668
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:31,110
I think it was maybe not manual
it somewhere somewhere in the uh,

669
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,890
outside of New York. It was
humiliating. Died, died,

670
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:37,780
a brutal, horrible death. I didn't,

671
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,730
I didn't know how to get myself out
of a bad mindset back then. And if I,

672
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:46,150
if anything happened bad during the day,
if I got in a fight with a check,

673
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,350
anything that went wrong, I could
spiral on stage. Like I can do good,

674
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:51,370
I can hold it together.

675
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,690
But I really had no business headlining
and brewer was having good sets all week.

676
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,920
We're both having good senses,

677
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,720
fun crowds.
But on the last show on Saturday night,

678
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:05,721
it was a late show and the crowd was
fucking drunk and he felt he fucking

679
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,620
killed.
And I was standing backstage and I,

680
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:13,710
this is one of my manager had just
convinced me to start dressing nice.

681
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,700
So I was wearing like club pants,

682
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,730
I'm wearing like a nice pair of slacks
and some nice shoes and I looked like the

683
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:26,091
most unfunny fuck on earth and I knew
it and I felt it like I'm like dressed

684
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:32,591
like this fucking stylish douche bag
and I'm going to go on stage and I don't

685
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:35,880
dress like this. This is not how addressed
if I was hanging out with my friends,

686
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:39,570
like this is not comfortable,
this is a fucking the close of an asshole.

687
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,080
And so I felt a backstage,
I was like, Shit. I'm like,

688
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:44,250
I can't be thinking like this.

689
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,900
I can't be thinking that I
shouldn't be dressed like this,

690
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,650
but I couldn't help it. And I might,
knee was fucked up at the time.

691
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:52,800
I had just gotten my ACL, just
tore. I hadn't had the surgery yet,

692
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:56,160
so I couldn't move good on stage.
If I moved funny one way or another,

693
00:40:56,161 --> 00:41:00,000
my leg would pop out. So I had
all this shit in my head like, oh,

694
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,370
what if my knee pops out?
Fuck, I don't feel funny.

695
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,720
And I went on stage and just a dick.
I mean,

696
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:10,350
every joke that came out of my mouth,
I didn't know how to say it right.

697
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,740
My timing was off.
I was panicking.

698
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,430
And the worst part about it was this
dude fucking in the crowd goes, man,

699
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:21,810
you're not fucking funny.
And I couldn't say anything to him.

700
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,320
I couldn't say anything to him.
Cause I know he's right. You know,

701
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:28,830
all I can say to him as you're not
helping, this is not helping, you know?

702
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:32,880
But there's nothing in that, you know,
just pointing out that he's an asshole.

703
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,010
He knows he's an asshole.
He thinks

704
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,240
he's entitled to be an Asshole. He paid
to see my shitty act, you know? And, uh,

705
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:41,030
that was a huge learning point for me,
man,

706
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,470
about the mindset that you have
to have when you go on stage,

707
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,280
when you're young and you're,
you know,

708
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:48,680
your life is in disorder and
you go on stage like that,

709
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,940
you could have a goddamn tailspin
over,

710
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:55,210
you have to accomplish to a
mom and one and at the FEC rank

711
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,000
addressed the fucking elephant in my head.
Oh Shit.

712
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,070
I'm fucked. No, you're
going to be fine by, listen,

713
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:11,250
this isn't that. Joey and I are
going to come with, all right.

714
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,830
I'm going to come with Brian and I will
come with the kit will come with you.

715
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,450
I am. Fuck. We're going to be whatever
you past that. I don't smoke pot.

716
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,600
You're on mushrooms,
power mushrooms. Oh God.

717
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,370
What do you expect? Just throw out a
quick disclaimer. A smoke a second.

718
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,920
That's how wide you motherfuckers got me.

719
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,100
I really have no concept of fucking tired.
Like I was still worried about it, man.

720
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,440
Don't worry about, don't worry about
it. Let it go. Talk to them like,

721
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,280
this is what it seems like an okay,
I'm going to help you right here.

722
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:51,590
I'm gonna help you right here.
You're tripping. I'm not,

723
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:54,120
so let me take care of everything.

724
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,900
You live on this weed. You're fine.
The mushrooms, you're not afraid of.

725
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:02,200
The weed is what's freaking out and
there's more where that came from.

726
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:06,770
Cox introspective juice, Bro. It taps you
into the fucking nature of the universe.

727
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,440
He's just getting out the fucking problems
that I had my head and then we'll,

728
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,450
I'll be fine now.
I just wanted to say,

729
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:17,280
I really don't have any concept of time
right now. Good, good. That's good.

730
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,350
I got it. Well then I had to
just yet. So you can good.

731
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,840
You set it so that now it's
my responsibility. I'm going
to get you to your show.

732
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,360
Who you're working with tonight.
I'm not worried about anything,

733
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,880
but I want you to not thought out because
I was looking at you kind of melting,

734
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,480
like wanting to say, but I didn't want
to interrupt. Your story is a fuck baby.

735
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:37,210
Look at me with these glasses on.

736
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,900
So I'm not fucking 22 fucking kicking
on the couch saying and called nine one

737
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:46,130
one. Stan hope. And I did the weird thing.

738
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:50,930
I had to get out of my standup and I did
DMT and Stan hope went into like almost

739
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:54,810
like a semi seizure. And uh, it was
the only time I'd ever been right.

740
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,580
Anybody who did DMT. Yeah, that's
what you, when you came out,

741
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:02,150
but before you came out of it,
you were moaning manual like this

742
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,300
and it was like you got knocked out dude.

743
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:11,720
It was the same sound that a guy makes
when he gets brutally knocked out.

744
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:16,390
When a guy just gets fucking smashed.
They have this [inaudible] guy last night,

745
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,070
the ultimate fighter. The first fight.
I didn't see the fights last night.

746
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,330
Fucking spoiler alert, Joey. Well,
I don't know who it happened to,

747
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,360
so thanks for not saying
the names, but a, I'm a,

748
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:27,230
I'm going to go check it out
tonight. This weekend, man.

749
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,250
I wish you could come around this
weekend. Busiest weekend. Dot.

750
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,100
My rarest common [inaudible] come

751
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,820
to the fights. Are He's coming? Is he a
working with Damo? Rare in Vegas? No, no,

752
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,370
he's just coming down to see the fights
and there's a perfect, you know dom,

753
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,400
I ray was really good at pool and
don my rare play and I play pool.

754
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:43,590
Sometimes we're going to go
watch some professionals gamble.

755
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,280
There's this thing called the action
report.com and they have like professional

756
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:51,420
pool players and they have these big high
level gambling matches where they all

757
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:56,190
pool together like 50 a hundred thousand
dollars and you know like the buy in is

758
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,310
usually like $10,000 each guy and then
they bet a bunch of money on the side.

759
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,990
Brian,
that shit is really distracting.

760
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,220
I'm trying to put something on and
just drag a light side distracting. Is

761
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,850
this Joey's breathing

762
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,230
like Darth Vader. I was an opiate Anthony
the other day and I was listening to,

763
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:18,770
it was in my car and Bobby Kelly, he's
like show, what are you fucking breathing?

764
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,960
What's up with your breathing? And I
didn't hear it when I was on the phone,

765
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,130
but then I was listening to the radio.

766
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:27,450
I have a stupid headset and it sits in
front of my nostrils. So as you know,

767
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:28,284
I'm talking to him.

768
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,920
I don't even realize I'm doing this.
Like the whole camp.

769
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,790
It was the most annoying
fucking thing ever.

770
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,850
So they're all you who are listening
that day. I'm really sorry.

771
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,760
I did not know that. I was making those
annoying noises in the background.

772
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,950
That's going to be some great fights this
weekend and motherfucking next weekend.

773
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,680
Yeah, absolutely. I Jon Jones but cheated.

774
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:52,140
You got some John George Allen
Burger gets Diego Sanchez.

775
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,370
Eve Edwards versus El Kukui on Spike TV.
Oh Shit.

776
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:59,940
What about fucking Phil Davis Against
Russia? They're finally doing that.

777
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,240
You're going to Japan. I love and am at
Bisping. It's going to be a crazy fight.

778
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:10,260
Fight, fight. We agree. Fucking
fat. I wish she were going
to be there. Yeah, we'd go.

779
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,520
Ari should is going to be there.

780
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:15,930
The and gentleman and he's also going to
be playing his famous Ra shift fear non

781
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:20,850
UFC sponsored non UFC sanction. Hunt for
the edible. I don't know what that means,

782
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:23,610
but uh, if you want to follow it and I
have no connection to this whatsoever.

783
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,990
Go Duh, Ra should fear on
Twitter at a r I s h a f, F,

784
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,590
I r and he may or may not
be hiding. We'd play, sorry,

785
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:36,720
I'm going to see on Fox are we showed
up with a bag of Carmelo's are we always

786
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:40,800
had is 29,000 edibles close by the
other day I called my wife gets savage.

787
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,230
I call him up. I can't believe
I'm in traffic. Goes now,

788
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:47,520
you know I always have weed in my car
and he talked me into roll the joint on

789
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:50,370
the four oh five he goes roller.
Who gives a fuck? Smoke it.

790
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,450
You rolled it while you're stuck in
traffic. Yeah, it's beautiful wood.

791
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,560
Fucking handle old school.
You know what I like man,

792
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,480
I don't mind being in my car and traffic.

793
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,510
As long as I got that hands free system,
I could talk to people on the phone.

794
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,030
It's not bad man. You have
a conversation, you know,

795
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:07,700
I have like a nice long conversations
with friends. When you catch up, catch up,

796
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,990
phone calls,
you've been everybody's texting.

797
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:13,950
That's all everybody does is text these
days. You know the calls to calls to tax.

798
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:16,720
It's like text is five to one,
you know.

799
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,250
Have you been doing any of the Syria
Siri texting while you're in the car now?

800
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:23,370
As soon as I found out that Siri goes
to a fucking database, I just said,

801
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:27,090
why am I doing this? Yeah, everything you
do goes to a database. And I was like,

802
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:30,450
I don't like talking about that fucking
shit that we were talking about this

803
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:34,670
another thing. Yeah. Well you know,
apparently that was in a I o s um,

804
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,730
the iPhone operating system,
uh,

805
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:39,850
for in a diagnostic mode
only back in the day,

806
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,400
but it's not in it like android phones.
What John,

807
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,460
Bryan and I are talking about some new
thing that came out. What is it called?

808
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:47,580
Iq Client Iq.
Client.

809
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,860
Is there a reason why they say it's
in there? They have, they really,

810
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:53,560
I don't think anybody's
figured it out yet.

811
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:57,190
It's just been recently discovered and
what it is for the folks who don't know

812
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:00,760
what the fuck we're talking about when
you buy an android phone. Doug, Stan,

813
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:03,160
hope you have an android phone
now. All right. You're fucked up.

814
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:04,150
You should have went iPhone.

815
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,080
I know you tried to be a nice contrary
and go against the tide. I W I got what?

816
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:11,350
They use a window. Go get her to
those things I can fucking see.

817
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,370
So I don't have to put on reading glasses.
Well they apparently,

818
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:20,000
every time you send a text it logs it
in a database somewhere. It's stores.

819
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,420
He prays every,
every number you practice,

820
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,840
everything you do is logged
in a database somewhere.

821
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,940
My girlfriend doesn't
get on the line much.

822
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,320
So will you tell him that's not
even it do this Joe wrote? No, no,

823
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,180
it's not that.
I don't think it's that.

824
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:36,070
It's been proven and that's
where it gets interesting.

825
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:38,140
It's not that I don't think other
people have done it. I mean,

826
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:41,950
I think the FBI and the CIA
has been trying to do this,

827
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,400
trying to have the ability
to spy on people. And you
know, the argument is, well,

828
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:48,280
if you know doing wrong, what
are you worried about? Yeah,

829
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:50,530
but that's not the
point is it can be done.

830
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:54,110
So it will be just so he could get
doors database like, yeah, but it's,

831
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:58,210
and then manipulate that.
That's a qualification, that
argument, that argument.

832
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:00,400
Like if you're not doing anything wrong,
what are you worried about it?

833
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,360
But that's a shit argus in your fucking
life. They shouldn't be then finding,

834
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,840
let me film you poop. I want to see how
much you do. You look at the paper is,

835
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,090
you're not doing anything wrong.
Let me do it. Let me watch them.

836
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,240
I want somebody to know how many
times did do happy faces, you know,

837
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:20,620
or stupid stuff like that.
I do happy faces all day.

838
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,770
What's wrong with that?
Are still stuck in their business.

839
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,470
At the other end of this fucking wire,

840
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:29,890
there's the human being that does
that and he'll be dead with all that

841
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:33,100
information we give. So it's not that
man. You know what the real picture is?

842
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:34,720
It's not that.
The real picture is,

843
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,020
is that we're losing all of our secrets
and it's going to come to a point in

844
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:42,850
time where there will be no secrets
at all. Yeah, absolute honesty.

845
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:47,020
But yeah, it was like you
can't fight this. It is a
compelling thought, but it's,

846
00:49:47,021 --> 00:49:47,261
you know,

847
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:51,430
everyone's terrified of it because
it's being controlled by a group of us.

848
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:54,670
It's by one, one, one group of
the population, the people who,

849
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:56,860
you know have this information
that's being controlled by them.

850
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,120
And we don't like the idea of anybody
having any control over any of us because

851
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,460
we know it's natural human nature
to want to dominate people.

852
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,270
So when you see something like this
and it was just a database that records

853
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,040
everything, you're fucked.
That's inevitable, right?

854
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,050
I mean if this is the
direction that it's going,

855
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,530
if you look at like just
how interconnected everybody
is with Facebook now and

856
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,610
you know, you just look at like,
that's a reason Twitter, it's going in,

857
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,820
going in that direction.

858
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:24,690
The person in the cubicle next to you
is now a celebrity because she can ego

859
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,980
surf herself and go, Yo,
I can candy Stouffer is

860
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,840
a fucking cunt. She talks too loud
and her breath smells like, yeah.

861
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,900
That's just because the fucking person
next to you in the cubicle that you bitch

862
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:38,790
at every morning is Facebooking about you.
So yeah,

863
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,580
and you could get famous where
with one fucking youtube video,

864
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,120
you're going to have one youtube video
you put up there and you can get famous

865
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:51,300
and you'll be as famous as the
next youtube video unless you,

866
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,770
you're really good at. But that's a
good thing. Yeah, it is a good thing.

867
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,700
The whole thing is amazing. It's
remembering clear channel. Yeah.

868
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,700
Just the word struck. Fear of
the, of what? A fucking corporate,

869
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,840
I don't even know if they exist anymore,
if it does. Well, because there's,

870
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:10,010
this is what matters. Yeah.
Podcasts. What people,

871
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,490
I was about to dump serious because,
but now you're getting a show on Sirius,

872
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,460
but on Sirius for awhile. On Saturday
and Sunday. But it fucking dump it.

873
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,830
Who gives a shit? No, no, no.
Don't go, hey Joe, you don't
want to dump serious, right?

874
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:26,490
I love series. I'm just not till I find
knew I could get it in my car. I'd listen.

875
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:30,400
I got to fucking drive an hour and a
half to an airport. You can get any car.

876
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:35,490
I get serious, dude. Yes. Every weekend
we're on the opiate Anthony Channel.

877
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,580
I wish we had just announced
the opie and Anthony Chao.

878
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,710
We should get free passes from serious.
At least we could give Doug a free year,

879
00:51:43,711 --> 00:51:47,460
right? Yeah. We pay for our
own serious talk. Good about
serious here. But uh, yeah,

880
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:50,230
it's fun. Cool. I love the fact
that you can be in the car.

881
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:51,970
Like I and I listened to series every day.

882
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,870
I listen to OPA Anthony basically every
day riding fas and I listened to the

883
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:00,350
news. There's a lot of good talk radio
stations. I have this built in thing.

884
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:03,860
I can't get the XM things for some
reason. Really? Why is that? Well,

885
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:05,790
maybe I haven't. No, you
can't. You can't now either.

886
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:11,150
Maybe you just need to up
your prescription. CNN,

887
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,620
BBC

888
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,730
music on my fucking presets.

889
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:20,900
Now it's all sag vinyl cause every now
and then I'll hit it for a goof and

890
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:24,200
something go. Ooh. Yeah, I forgot that
one for record player in your car.

891
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,020
Fuck. Get it. Oh Brian,

892
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,410
you buffoon bright shirt.
What the fuck bro?

893
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,990
Come on and talk dog. It's only four
30, 30 cops. I'm trying to stay.

894
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,180
I just fucking the time guys. Yeah, no,

895
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,640
I just go to my,
watch it on the table.

896
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,270
Like I dropped a bomb on me late.
So, um, are you coming December 30th?

897
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:57,200
That UFC Brock Lesnar vs Alistair Overeem?
No,

898
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,870
I'm gonna do New Year's with you. Okay.
We're gonna do, we're going to do a,

899
00:53:01,871 --> 00:53:06,290
um, um, a Vegas show in February
around like Superbowl time.

900
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,620
Yeah, we're going to do another way
to the Mandalay bay, a big one. A.

901
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:16,060
Does anyone in the UFC did any
of the fight areas? Not like you?

902
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,990
I get along with pretty much everyone.
Yeah. I don't have any problems with it.

903
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:22,390
If I do what I always straighten
it out. It's, you know,

904
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,160
it's a difficult thing when you're
criticizing people. Exactly. That's

905
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:26,940
fuck out of you.

906
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,550
And you're criticizing them about their
ability to beat the fuck out of each

907
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:30,720
other and you gotta go, look, man,

908
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,150
I'm not saying I can do it better
than you because that's the automatic

909
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:37,050
presumption. I'm just saying this is
what you're doing wrong. I can see it.

910
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,390
The WHO's fighting for that
soup bowls a Saturday. Who?

911
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,150
Who's fighting the Superbowl earlier?
Did you set,

912
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,140
this thing's not finding the fucking guy
from the show again in Bisping's fight

913
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:53,130
and ma'am. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh
yeah. Oh No. I thought I heard
a different name. Like, no,

914
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,650
they're fighting and they're
fighting this weekend.

915
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,970
This is a fucking huge fight for Ma'am
and for, you know, for Bisping this,

916
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:03,810
you know, it just brings him into like
top contender status. If he beats mayhem,

917
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,170
you know, he's, he's right up
there with everybody else. Bam.

918
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,990
Have credits other than the stupid,
yeah,

919
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:15,100
fraudulent VH. It wasn't fraudulent. They
there was irresponsible perhaps, but a

920
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,000
fraudulent from a, just a
viewer's level like, Oh yeah,

921
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:24,690
they have a beef and they're
gonna Change Cock sucker.

922
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:31,140
That's a change I don't see.

923
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:34,410
I'm on the UFC small.
They don't have the super bowl

924
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,690
as big as it. That's how big
is it? It's more of a jar.

925
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,690
She don't have the Superbowl card up here,
unfortunately.

926
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,940
We can all talk about Joey jingles.
Watch your fucking change jar people.

927
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:52,900
What's he goes, that's your new
nickname? Only until we jingle.

928
00:54:52,901 --> 00:54:57,000
The only time I got in trouble I was feel
change out of cars and shit. Which one?

929
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:58,140
That was on open.

930
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:02,670
Miker opened micro and I sold cars and
at night I was living in the city and I

931
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:04,890
needed a change to get back
over the fucking bridge.

932
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:10,320
We'd steal quarters or dimes to get
a doll 35 or something, but this is,

933
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,800
it was one of those periods and this shit,

934
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:16,770
this is what you always have to worry
when when when your friends are telling

935
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:20,220
you they don't do drugs,
that's when you worry about them.

936
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,880
When they are fucking doing heroin.
Fucking sage all night.

937
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:28,170
That's a guy you can trust, right?
It's the guy. No, I cleaned up Jay.

938
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:30,170
Just do you need anything?

939
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,610
You need me to house
sit while you're gone.

940
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,140
I cleaned up with some
fucking crazy times.

941
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,660
They'll just some crazy fucking
times, man. It really don't.

942
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,450
Hollywood Joey jingles thing
is like young Hollywood doing.

943
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:49,200
I hope he's not really fast, crazy days.
A weird thought that came into my head,

944
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:54,240
but I remember being at
the coach, coach, coach,

945
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,570
coach and horses. Yeah. Coked up
to the point where I couldn't talk.

946
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,490
Looking to my left and seen James Gamble
Feeney there with two of the hottest

947
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:04,740
fucking blondes.
You ever seen your life ready to get?

948
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:09,741
His Dick sucked looking at me and he's
is whacked up as I am looking at me and

949
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:14,970
be looking at him going to be
fucked up with that friend of yours.

950
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:19,230
The girl, I mean that was me and Hedberg
went in there as when he lived on Syrah,

951
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,800
Beneatha's fucking staying on his couch
and we went in there as like a like a

952
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:24,310
day

953
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,310
or we were day Jerry like we always
walked past and it's right up the fucking

954
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:32,770
street, but then they realize how cool
it was and the no one was in there.

955
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:37,360
There's, they had this bartender named
ginger ginger. It was like fucking,

956
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,270
it's throw momma from the train,
you know Mama,

957
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,070
she was that fucked up and she was like,

958
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,440
and she was covered in the liver
spots or rank sores or whatever. No,

959
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:54,130
she fucking, they booted. This is
all fucking nineties but yeah, they,

960
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,600
they've, she had been a bartender there
for, since its heyday before. Wow.

961
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,560
You know how dive bars
go then they go through.

962
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,670
So they couldn't fire her in those old
alcoholic random, but she, she was like,

963
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,690
she threw a blind guy out
of the bar for having a dog.

964
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:12,960
They go guards.

965
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,920
And then the regulars that knew
her were trying to explain no,

966
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,130
it's a seeing eye dog. He's a
boy. He's blind. I don't care.

967
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:25,900
No dogs. Wow. Like horrific
fucking human being.

968
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,960
You'd be sitting in it, sit
at the bar and, and you,

969
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:34,910
your drink is out and
I,

970
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,753
good.

971
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:41,530
No one was listening to me so I just
got thrown off the sound of Joey's

972
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:44,910
breathing and the silence together.
It was just starving for what?

973
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,490
You'd have an empty drink and she'd
go out, ed and I did like and,

974
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:53,320
and people would say, uh, no,
I'm good right now. And you
go, this isn't a bus stop.

975
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,540
Wow. Like there was, that's why there was
no one in there. But then you'd fucking,

976
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:03,280
next thing you know you're doing it was
Quintin Tarantino at they were doing is

977
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:08,281
me and like Hedberg and Quentin Tarantino
and that's it in this dive shit hole

978
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,120
did it. It's closed now, right?

979
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah. It's when we play,
the place is closed,

980
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,840
but we still get tennis rackets
and play time pictures of it. Yeah.

981
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,830
We haven't Hedberg. And what was the
kid with the long hair from Seattle?

982
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,980
I was an Ireland doing comedy
and he was Shard Hogan.

983
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,690
Oh my God. All those guys. And

984
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,780
then say Fulton Day full.
Yeah, he's staying home.

985
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:35,380
How to rent a car that was
in front of his house. Again,

986
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,200
you could just jump in it and
drive it whenever you need it.

987
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:43,500
But the gas gauge was broken.
I got busted one time as Santa Monica.

988
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:46,210
Sam is sent day.
I'd fucking rush hour because you know,

989
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:49,510
you're just getting a car.
I have an audition standup.
I'm in a bind. Take the car,

990
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:53,800
boom, getting a fucking car
ran out of gas. Oh my God,

991
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,020
don't fucking is the gas gauges
broken fucking idea. Another night,

992
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,100
Stan hope is out of town or something
like that, and he goes, take the cost.

993
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:05,140
So lean.
And so he goes,

994
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,270
take the car and just bring it
to stand hopes in the morning.

995
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:09,490
I parked it on sunset.
They've fucking toe it.

996
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:15,520
The whitening of $200 for the
white via tended to fucking motor.

997
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:19,420
When you lived in Venice in that house
that was painted like the American flag

998
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,130
painted and right after nine,

999
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,730
this giant as a duplex and they,

1000
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:29,060
it was fucking giant stars
in the fucking stripes.

1001
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,540
Oh, so, so super bowl weekend is a Diaz
versus Saint Pierre. That's what it is.

1002
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:38,000
Shit. Yeah. I don't know if a saint
peers fully repaired those repair.

1003
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:41,770
He had an injury he had
from listing to Diaz healed.

1004
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:46,750
The fucking thing just yielded. I hope so.
A lot of other fights or Carlos condit.

1005
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:51,310
Josh Cox. Let's stop fucking
talking like fans and talk like men.

1006
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,740
We don't watch GSP for
his knees. All right. Oh,

1007
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,950
keep wearing those tight fucking shorts.
I love you motherfucker.

1008
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,260
You suck that he shaved. Is that what
it is? I don't know what it is. Sunday,

1009
01:00:02,261 --> 01:00:05,550
we're going to have a show here at the
ice house. Apm. Is that what it is? Brian

1010
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:13,030
podcast starts at seven shows that eight
o'clock powerful gentleman, Joe Diaz.

1011
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:17,980
Ladies and gentlemen, follow
him on Twitter. It's mad
flavor. Mad Flavor bitches.

1012
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:21,490
Funniest fucking guy in the
world. Love you too, man.

1013
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,630
I'll see you Sunday.
Jesus. Powerful Joe. Yes.

1014
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,860
Ralphie may was making out with your mom.
Oh yeah, we were. Whoa. Wait a minute.

1015
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,330
We haven't talked about
my, yeah, they cats.

1016
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:46,650
I fucking sad. I still talk
about that. My Act sale.

1017
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,580
It's then,
well this cat died,

1018
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,810
so she had a wig for the cap that you put
a little towel and she put the fucking

1019
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:56,410
towel and she had all the cats sit
around the dead cat and look at them and

1020
01:00:56,411 --> 01:00:57,700
express their condolences.

1021
01:00:57,701 --> 01:01:01,120
To the guy and I told Mrs [inaudible]
was the stay at home. She goes,

1022
01:01:01,121 --> 01:01:02,480
look at them.
They love the categories.

1023
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:05,200
Then little love this sitting
around and going, I need that.

1024
01:01:05,201 --> 01:01:08,240
And that way I think that tail,
because everybody was busy.

1025
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,640
Something my mother was great,
was a cat,

1026
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:13,110
was missing a leg that belonged
to mrs family. Fuck it.

1027
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,180
That leads me into plugging

1028
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,410
to December 10th,

1029
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:24,760
December 10th Tucson fucking
Joey Diaz has he shown up.

1030
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:27,160
Shawn Rao says he showed us
what we already have. Brendan,

1031
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:32,640
Brendan Walsh, Brody Stevens,
Saturday, December 10th.

1032
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,630
What does it offer yet?
The reality though,

1033
01:01:36,631 --> 01:01:40,590
theater in a Tucson. Oh no,
sounds awesome. What does,

1034
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:45,240
it's why it's of
benefit for the humane society.

1035
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,950
Oh really? Every fucking penny. I'm
paying comics. Fucking airfares.

1036
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:53,820
Really? Oh, that's that things coming
out of the gate. I got that surgery.

1037
01:01:53,821 --> 01:01:58,650
I'd have fucking umbilical hernia.
So I just put on my website as a joke.

1038
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,970
Is it? Uh, yeah. Uh, I have this,

1039
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,750
I described the problem is that
it's a belly button hernia,

1040
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,710
which is your fucking intestines
pouring your guts. Oh my God.

1041
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,570
But the fatter and older I got,

1042
01:02:12,571 --> 01:02:16,800
the more pronounced it became and people
are like, you got to get that check.

1043
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,040
Anyway, I put on my
website, I'll give you a, if

1044
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,330
you're a surgeon out there,

1045
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:25,290
I'll give you a free DVD if you
me free surgery and I got it.

1046
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,920
Really? Yeah, free surgery.

1047
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,860
What does it like
cutting under some a fan.

1048
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:36,861
It's going to put you under and opioids
out fucking w wilds and whites of West

1049
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:41,100
Virginia. Fucking oxycotton. I
can fix anything kind of surgery.

1050
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,990
It was a respectful dot.
No,

1051
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:48,000
they were anesthesiologists that were
fans and you look like Robert Deniro at

1052
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:51,750
some points and I'm trying to fucking
ignore a lot of things that are going on

1053
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:56,070
in my head. Which Robert
Deniro, the Cape Fear One.

1054
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,050
I don't know your fucking
heads just does that naturally.

1055
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:05,650
Kind of twisting out of
control, dude, dude, dude, dude.

1056
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:11,340
Dude,
that's so funny.

1057
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,700
So hope story all going to be groovy.
Yeah. This the story. Who knows?

1058
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,960
Could be anything. What? Any idea what
his story was about. I can't remember.

1059
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:23,130
Something about Ralphie may make it out
with your mom. That's right. Yeah, I know.

1060
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,860
That's what it was supposed to. It's
where I was supposed to go. Yeah.

1061
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:30,810
What was I fucking, was I talking
about my mother? No, I think,

1062
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:33,150
I think Joey Diaz just did one of those
things where he just ran out and it's

1063
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:37,830
like, oh, I might drop this
bomb and run flux. Your head up.

1064
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:42,450
So important man. This guys like
him. So important. It's so important.

1065
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,900
And you meet dudes that are
just out there on the fringes.

1066
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:51,350
We were randomly talking about this last
night or this morning about like people

1067
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:56,580
that you know that are funnier than
any comics, you know, they fucking die.

1068
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,670
There's that. Oh, comedy
lost a massive, no,

1069
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:01,840
that was a funny dude at a bar I have.

1070
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:06,841
I have so many people I know that how
many a lot of things and they just never

1071
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:08,274
get into stand up.

1072
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:12,240
But my manager is funnier than me
and I know it fucking destroys it.

1073
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:17,400
Really genuinely brilliant and
funny and my manager's funny.

1074
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,140
My business manager's funny.

1075
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:23,970
My business manager as funny as comics
are funny, he can be a comic, he can eat,

1076
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:27,390
they can easily, both of them could have
been comics if they want it to be. Yeah.

1077
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:30,480
I know a lot of people that could have
been comics. There's a lot of them,

1078
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,470
you know, and it's, it's a funny thing.
It's who decides to take that road?

1079
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,480
Who decides not to. Same, but you know
those people that could have done it. Man,

1080
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:41,760
they're the same type of people to
be around. You know, some of the,

1081
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,130
the guys that used to
hang out with at the pool,

1082
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,740
funniest fucking human beings
I've ever met. They're just,

1083
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,800
they're just derelicts gambling junkies
and they're just wild motherfuckers just

1084
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:54,960
due to, they weren't fitting in
into some nine to five suit job.

1085
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:56,070
It wasn't working out for them.

1086
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,150
And it wasn't even like comics where
comics tried to say something funny on

1087
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:04,460
purpose. Exactly. Funny people. Exactly.
They're not working on it right now.

1088
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:09,000
Working on a bit. Yeah. Joey Diaz
just fucking, I mean, come on.

1089
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:13,010
What is cliche is, yeah, you may
a phone book, but he's that funny.

1090
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:15,450
Do you remember the early days when
dudes would actually try bits on you?

1091
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:19,600
That's the worst. Oh yeah. No, I
still get it. I do it all the time.

1092
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:25,030
You do it all the time to people? Uh, I
don't do, I don't like it. It's not a bit,

1093
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:26,980
it's something I think of that
it's funny and I'm just like, oh,

1094
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:28,930
I'll just say it out loud
to see if I think it's fun.

1095
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,690
Everyone thinks it's funny or if you know,
but it's not like I'm,

1096
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,900
I've been writing this bit for many, many
weeks and I can't, you know what I mean?

1097
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,200
Like it's more, it's something
I just thought of maybe
like that minute, you know,

1098
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:39,360
you're not sure they

1099
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:44,080
try it out on people. I don't really,
I don't think about trying it out loud.

1100
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:47,920
If you're saying, hey listen, I'm working
on this bit. Do you have any ideas?

1101
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:49,670
They'll,
he'll just fucking forced me.

1102
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,000
I won't even say what city
because cause he'd know.

1103
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,160
But there was a comic like a old,

1104
01:05:57,161 --> 01:06:02,161
like fucking 30 some plus years
in the business in the green room.

1105
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,410
Hey, haven't seen you in so
long. You haven't worked out.

1106
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:11,370
And he's starts telling me I can give
it away with that voice I now know is

1107
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:18,640
knowing you. You probably know.
Yeah, no, it's, no, no, no.

1108
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:22,310
I am I talking, I'm fucked up.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Black British. Sorry. So happy.

1109
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:26,830
I'm targeting this. Oh, sorry.
Anyway, no, no, I'm good. I'm good.

1110
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,630
I'm going to fucking power
through this up. Oh yeah.

1111
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:36,580
So he is fucking rifts. All these jokes,
but that bad, like from the new Eh,

1112
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,320
as trying to my station,

1113
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:43,150
but he's doing a guest set and then goes
immediately from the green room and has

1114
01:06:43,151 --> 01:06:48,010
the exact same conversation we just
had in the green room as a set.

1115
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,020
Oh, you know what he did?
He just ear fucked you.

1116
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:53,290
He just made you sit and listen
to his sets so he could warm up.

1117
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,320
That's what he did. It was, I mean, it
was almost immediate. Like, Hey, wow,

1118
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,130
perfect for him. He's like, if I
can get it off in front of Stan,

1119
01:07:00,131 --> 01:07:03,320
hope probably be fine. But it was
someone I've known for like, yeah,

1120
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,270
but he doesn't care.
Here's is,

1121
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:09,450
here's these people that are basically
almost sociopathic. You know, their,

1122
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:11,460
their desire to succeed,

1123
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:16,270
desire to like do well on stage supersedes
everything, supersedes being a human,

1124
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,590
you know,

1125
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:21,160
and they don't care if they just use
you to get their shit off and practice

1126
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:24,860
before they go onstage.
Stage in my friend, I'm gonna
practice on you. You know,

1127
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,000
your friends suck my Dick.
They just in the mouth,

1128
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,740
they're just ear fucking you
instead of fucking your mouth.

1129
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:32,500
They're fucking your ear.
Like they want to get off on your mouth.

1130
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:37,260
They can't fin again had the uh,
their talk blockers talk bloggers.

1131
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:40,680
I was Christian Finnegan. That's
a good way of putting it. Yeah.

1132
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:44,770
There's people that just want to talk
at you, man. That's the cocaine effect.

1133
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,150
I don't know what that is, but
I've noticed, you know, I'm,

1134
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,780
I'm very ignorant to the
effects of cocaine. The only,

1135
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:53,770
the only insight that I have is the
one time that you and I drank that co,

1136
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:58,570
that Mata de cocoa tea. It was
the same, same time that we,

1137
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:02,110
the whole day of the war. Oh yeah.
All right. And I remember saying,

1138
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:06,100
I can't shut the fuck up. Like I got a
real problem. I cannot shut the fuck up.

1139
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,490
I'll give you,
I'll give you an analogy that might work.

1140
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:13,300
You know when you're like
you're writing really well. Yes.

1141
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:17,680
And you're like fucking I,
I this to Bingo. You fucking
just be with me cause it,

1142
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:22,681
my head's going faster than I can write
and I just bounce ideas off of her on

1143
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:27,260
PR. That's the cocaine is
like where you're fucking
okay, I'm rapid cycling. No,

1144
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:30,770
you need to hear this. Cause my
fucking brains going. And so,

1145
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,850
but it's two people doing that at the
same time and it's all fucking pointless.

1146
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:39,380
And it's a bad note book. It's in organic.
Yeah. Well his Adderall, the medium then,

1147
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,250
cause a lot of people that are on Adderall
day, they, they mean, but what is it,

1148
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,190
what's the difference between
the cocaine high in a speed high?

1149
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,030
Well I know Adderall is very
much a lot like cocaine.

1150
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:53,160
It makes me feel like I'm meeting
getting drips because it just is like a

1151
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:57,460
constant reminder that it feels
like I'm on cocaine and I, but wow.

1152
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,950
But it seems like it lasts
longer and like where cocaine,

1153
01:09:00,951 --> 01:09:05,630
you feel this like up and then like
15 minutes later sold web for me.

1154
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:10,510
Adderall. That just gives me anxiety.
That's a long term. Like I don't, I,

1155
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,200
I liked the uh, the seller, what do you
call it, the, the practice of doing coke.

1156
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:19,160
I like shopping up and doing
a line is really romantic

1157
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:26,050
and if you do it in a fucking comedy,
like the comedy store, Green Room of the,

1158
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,900
the main stage green room at
the comedy store, just like,

1159
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,090
I want to chop up a ramp mirror.
It's just kind of

1160
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:37,880
mirrors the weird piano.
It's hilarious.

1161
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,760
You do read Buller's like
I can do. Yeah. Boom. Okay.

1162
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:48,490
I do a bump and I move on with my life.
It's like fucking energy drink now.

1163
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:53,570
Yeah. Really? Wow. That's, it's, yeah,
it's the, the whole act of it is,

1164
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:57,020
I was on the highway once, I was like
18 years old. I was with my friends,

1165
01:09:57,021 --> 01:10:01,580
we were driving home and we were in
revere. We're near a Kelly's roast beef.

1166
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:05,660
It's fucking really sketchy neighborhood
with a great place to get fried clams.

1167
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,550
And, uh, as we're driving,

1168
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:12,530
we see this car beside us and the
people in the backseat had the light on.

1169
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:16,550
They had the dome line on and they were
doing coke and the girl looks over at me.

1170
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:18,530
I looked at her and
she'd just come the fuck,

1171
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,930
she just looks at me and has this
fucking evil look at her face. Fuck you.

1172
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:27,590
And I'm like, Whoa, how to know.
All I did was look over at you,

1173
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:31,160
caught you doing coke and she's
gone. And I was like, okay. So,

1174
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:35,750
but it was weird how a little thing like
that will scare you off of it. Yeah.

1175
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,560
There was that. The first
time I did acid, I puked.

1176
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:42,180
We lived in a Vegas. We're, uh,

1177
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:45,440
I lived with this family where
I'll like renting from her,

1178
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,480
but there was kids in the fucking,

1179
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,780
they'd play basketball in the
driveway every day and like, you know,

1180
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:55,010
eight to 12 years old every day.
The first time I did acid,

1181
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:59,240
we took it and I'm having a fun time
and I'm like, this is fucking good.

1182
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:04,570
And then we went back in for a second
hit and I put the acid on my tongue and

1183
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:07,260
then we walked back out into this.

1184
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:10,760
I'm fucking tripping hard
and there's a bunch of kids,

1185
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:14,100
little kids playing basketball
and someone threw me

1186
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,911
the basketball.

1187
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:19,410
So I inhaled still had the paper on
my tongue and it stuck to the fucking

1188
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:23,970
cliteracy in the back of your throat.
So I puked into my mouth

1189
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,260
in front of kids were,

1190
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,500
but I'm consciously thinking I don't
want to lose the hit of acid that I just

1191
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:35,670
put. So I'm, I have a mouth
full of puke trying not to.

1192
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,800
So I tried to swallow the Puke,

1193
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:41,970
which makes you puke way
harder than anything else. Oh.

1194
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:47,010
So I just, I extreme vomit in front
of all these horrified children.

1195
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,390
It's four in the afternoon

1196
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:54,420
and I start picking through the BW
cause I, so I don't want to listen.

1197
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,050
I don't want to lose that hit of acid.
Oh my God.

1198
01:11:58,051 --> 01:12:01,730
I found the acid in my previous
work it off and my beer neck.

1199
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,720
What are you even still work? The, the,

1200
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:08,780
the looks on the faces of
the children where some guy,

1201
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:14,360
your neighbor Guy Kinda guy is coming out
and now he's rummaging through his own

1202
01:12:15,151 --> 01:12:18,780
vomit the afternoon.
Oh,

1203
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:24,630
such a beautiful image and that might
queer those kids off and do an acid is my

1204
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,460
point. I, you know what? Yeah,

1205
01:12:26,461 --> 01:12:29,760
much like you are queered
off coke from a finger stick.

1206
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:34,530
Some men and a mullet rummaging through
his vomit on its side street in Vegas.

1207
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,180
Oh my God. That might make you think it
was one of the best nights of my life.

1208
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:44,210
Did you tell us it was one of the fucking
trip was still legendary like yeah,

1209
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,880
just from eating. Did you think when
you put it back in your mouth it,

1210
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:54,780
it hit you harder? Oh
boy. It was a second hit.

1211
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,020
The point is the, no, we,

1212
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:01,610
it was my first time tripping so I was
already on one hit and wanted more.

1213
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:03,650
Of course,
let's do more.

1214
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:05,783
Wow.

1215
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,650
Yeah, that probably did queer
them off. It probably just much.

1216
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:12,470
Is it okay to say queer,
the Moffett? No, I'm just,

1217
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:16,400
I'm just so happy I remembered why I
started this story is because you were

1218
01:13:16,401 --> 01:13:20,630
talking about the cocaine and the woman.
That seems like 40 minutes ago.

1219
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,280
It was a long time ago. Really? I'm so,

1220
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,270
it was weird when you started
taking a nap. Just right there.

1221
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,530
You took it like a little nap.
Do you remember?

1222
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:31,610
Did I drive some fucking with
you? Don't. Don't do that Brian.

1223
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,240
Tell fuck with dudes that are tripping.
All Con. That was not fucking, I'm sorry.

1224
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,120
All right, fellow settle
though. Your cigarette went out.

1225
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:42,800
I never knew cigarettes went out. Yeah.
Why? I guess I talked for a minute.

1226
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:47,780
I thought cigarettes just designed to
burn a lot of this show that I was just

1227
01:13:47,781 --> 01:13:51,680
sitting listening to in my car and
I'm like, oh wait, I'm on at fuck.

1228
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:55,910
I got to talk.
I was just a huge fan sitting back

1229
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,230
Mac for a while in California,

1230
01:13:57,231 --> 01:14:00,730
they actually have these new cigarettes
where they stopped burning after a

1231
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,840
certain parts of California.

1232
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:07,520
We were talking about that like that
was a fad, like childproof lighters,

1233
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,730
but it's a California thing. Well,
I don't know if it's all California,

1234
01:14:10,731 --> 01:14:12,130
if they just them for all cigarettes

1235
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,320
by it so that people,
when they flick them out their windows,

1236
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:17,440
they will go out and not
pillow and catch a fire. Yeah,

1237
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,550
it seems like it would be. How did they
do that? What kind of chemical is that?

1238
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,200
Who knows what the fuck they're
putting in there anyway,

1239
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:27,280
the FDA food and drug
administration as it is, they uh,

1240
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:31,510
they approved more than 500 different
chemicals that are in cigarettes.

1241
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:35,350
Well that's fantastic for Philip Morris.
Just put,

1242
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:40,550
did you buy stock more stock or
the day my fucking accountant, the,

1243
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,051
you know,

1244
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:45,730
do some mobile your money or
something so that he talks to you.

1245
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,610
Well know it is just accountant
Brendan Walsh. I would know it.

1246
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:52,720
That's how I hear it.

1247
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:59,570
It's just for trying to tell
me about a rainy day. Like,

1248
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,170
am I actually said that to him?
I go,

1249
01:15:02,171 --> 01:15:06,640
I don't really have that much
confidence in saving for later.

1250
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:12,480
So yeah, let's just keep
it in the bank. Well,

1251
01:15:12,481 --> 01:15:16,720
you can't get it all right.
That's all I care about.

1252
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,950
It's kind of hope it's still
real. Right? But yeah, no,

1253
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,000
I had to get comedy accounts.
They are very cool. But

1254
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,790
it was when,
when,

1255
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:30,000
when they're trying to talk to you
real businesslike and you go, yeah,

1256
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:34,690
it probably won't be alive
then. Ooh, how do we talk?

1257
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:38,320
So you got to an a accountant
that's just a regular dude.

1258
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:43,350
You don't know the comics account and he
has like 500 comics and I want to name

1259
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:46,900
drop and my camera, he still
doesn't think it's something Jewish.

1260
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,680
So he's still sharp. Harvey
Altman, Harvey Altman and his kid.

1261
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:53,260
They're fucking big comedy fans.
Well that's cool.

1262
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:57,010
So what he's trying to do is hear
shysters and we'll find out soon.

1263
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:01,360
Should I said those happen upon occasion.
They've done well by me.

1264
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:06,640
You've been shyster no, I said I've
done well by you. That was my plug.

1265
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:09,540
I have to always mention Harvey Altman.
Have you?

1266
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,860
I stutter and tried to remember his name.

1267
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:15,310
Have you heard about this new
fucking thing that's going down,

1268
01:16:15,311 --> 01:16:20,311
this new bill that they're trying to
define the United States first up.

1269
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:24,850
First of all, them don't fucking ona
me where you're talking to your laptop.

1270
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,710
I just want to make it seem like I'm
around wondering why I don't talk for 30

1271
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:33,200
minutes for a second.
Even fucking doors.

1272
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,130
Even Norton sits on there.
What is,

1273
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:39,160
he's constantly just looking
at his cell phone. Fucking, oh,

1274
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,770
I guess is always staring
at a laptop and you're like,

1275
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,800
what the fuck is it does ruin the flow.
You're correct.

1276
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,660
I just wanted to get your take.
Always thought.

1277
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:50,530
I always thought it was closing like
every time you do. Oh, and a, I love them.

1278
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:54,110
They're all great people. There's
no pretense with them, but it all,

1279
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:57,350
it all seems like they're
going out of business. Like

1280
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:02,140
what do you mean? They just
have that attitude of, yeah,

1281
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:06,850
anytime they're going to start taking
boxes out here because we're all just

1282
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:09,950
watching like they'd done.
It's not even like for the show,

1283
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:11,990
like you're looking up
something for the show.

1284
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,930
They're just firing around why
they're working. Oh, that's funny.

1285
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,720
Norton's fucking twittering.

1286
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,430
It's a problem when nobody stops
everybody from doing that. She,

1287
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:24,070
I went on there last time. I felt like,
are we really on the air so easiest?

1288
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:26,180
Just fucking check your
Twitter all the time.

1289
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,370
I think it's just because
they do it every day.

1290
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:31,070
Can you imagine doing this every
day? For what? For six hours.

1291
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:35,930
How long do they craziness. Yeah.
What we do is a lot, and it's still,

1292
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,870
don't get me wrong, no problem.
Very manageable, but yeah,

1293
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,520
it was a very comfortable, but it was
like where you go. I would just say, hey,

1294
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,320
we're just four of us hanging out.

1295
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,090
They're just so comfortable
with hanging out there.

1296
01:17:47,091 --> 01:17:51,140
It doesn't seem like from minutes
I'll come on. You don't know.

1297
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:53,100
It just seem like that when
you're in there you're,

1298
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,850
that's my favorite show to do
because when you do that show,

1299
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:59,510
it's just like you're hanging out. It
doesn't feel like you know, so many shows.

1300
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:01,520
It's like you feel like you're upright,

1301
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:04,580
you're posture is upright and you're just
trying to give a good presentation and

1302
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:06,140
then you leave. You know
you're like, this is,

1303
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,520
I never feel like I connected with these
people, but you know, you go to ona,

1304
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:12,500
it's just a hangout and
people just walk in. You know.

1305
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:14,090
He had those people walking in the hall,

1306
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:19,091
just claim one owned the place and
it was Marion Barry walked in once,

1307
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,910
Marion Barry and we were asking a
questions about smoking crack. Yeah,

1308
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:24,460
but this was in the hallway water.

1309
01:18:24,461 --> 01:18:29,461
Then the amount of energy dice clay can
still put into being dice cloud and you

1310
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:34,200
don't use a master. You have
no idea. What's an act like?

1311
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,990
I'm talking to north and he's my friend.

1312
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:39,500
I'm going to like how much it is that
that's what it's like on the road.

1313
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:43,420
And they like, well, you're not
telling me if you don't know. Right.

1314
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,700
Tamworth is real. Yeah. Well
he's got that, what's her name?

1315
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:51,440
The great chick from the comedy store
and legendary Eleanor. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1316
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:54,680
She was immediately knew who it is. That's
who I was thinking. Oh, I don't know.

1317
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:59,300
It's amazing. She's amazing. She is the
comedy store days. Yeah. When she's gone,

1318
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,760
that place is dead. You know. They,

1319
01:19:00,761 --> 01:19:03,540
they don't have any of the old waitresses
working there and she's still there.

1320
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:07,990
No, no, no, no. She's a comic
man. She's doing well. Oh fuck.

1321
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:12,590
She's doing really well.
But all the waitresses. Dot.
There was someone over there.

1322
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:14,400
Why Rating?

1323
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,470
Look at Robert plays a giant fucking
half naked Robert Plant and cock. Right?

1324
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,180
They're clearly defined.

1325
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:28,210
That's an 18 foot ceiling and they're
projecting Robert Plant's fucking package.

1326
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:29,810
While that's so weird,

1327
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:34,190
he's kind of his balls and cocker clearly
on the left side of his parents. Yeah,

1328
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:38,450
no, there's this, it's almost sculpted.
It's weird. It's not even real.

1329
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:42,410
And the way he moves, like he would
be terrible at fucking, you know,

1330
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,960
he's not like Bobbi Brown up there.
They haven't had a step back take.

1331
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:49,700
They called that whiskey Dick. He
just looks like a, the way he moves,

1332
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:52,370
he's like real awkward. He's a bond.
I wouldn't want him fucking me.

1333
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,970
I'll tell you that. I'm like, come on
buddy. What's this? What are we doing?

1334
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:58,420
Ever seen me dance, Joe, you never know

1335
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,360
Robert Plants on the wall,

1336
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:06,140
but they just didn't have the same
awareness back there. I don't think,

1337
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:08,070
don't worry. No, it's
filming looked different.

1338
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,373
They are though.

1339
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:15,570
If you had an all time favorite band
led Zeppelin, is it up there? No, no.

1340
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,370
Really Pink Floyd. The wall would
be like on my top five albums. Yeah,

1341
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:24,720
I agree.
But also have counting crows and uh,

1342
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,980
Tim Curry,
who no one knows his fucking music at all.

1343
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:34,110
Tim Curry put as it really Tim curry
the actor. Yeah. Really from clue. No,

1344
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:37,380
he had one kind of vague
hit with I do the rock.

1345
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:43,260
I do the rock myself. No.
Oh yeah. And that was it.

1346
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,320
Like he did rocky horror and then put out
two albums and then he was the lead in

1347
01:20:48,571 --> 01:20:53,280
rocky horror. Right. And he was thinking
that that wasn't it. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

1348
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,880
That guys are like a really good singer.
The kind of music,

1349
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,060
he's kind of Robert,
Robert,

1350
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:04,350
you putting him above us.
There's no Zeppelin album.

1351
01:21:04,351 --> 01:21:09,090
I want to sit on a fucking island
and listened to. That's crazy.

1352
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,320
You're the ocean. But I don't like
music. I don't like it just fucking,

1353
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:18,120
it just ruins conversation.
It does sometimes,

1354
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:21,780
but it's great when you're
on airplanes. I, you know, I,

1355
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,410
I read or I sleep. I
do too. I do those too.

1356
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:29,530
But I also like listening to music
and writing. I hate music. Yeah. No,

1357
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:34,260
I want to download it. And if
you're out to, if you're listening,

1358
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:39,120
I want a lot of fucking like
big band swing, but no vocals.

1359
01:21:39,121 --> 01:21:42,060
That's what I want to listen
to when I write is no vocals.

1360
01:21:42,061 --> 01:21:45,990
I want to have that background, Huh? Yeah.
Background music. I do the same thing.

1361
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:50,610
You know what I do? I do Spanish music.
They had fucking, Joe does radical.

1362
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:51,231
Yeah.

1363
01:21:51,231 --> 01:21:56,231
It sounds just as an air of cunty right
around it makes me write Cunty Ralphie

1364
01:21:56,911 --> 01:22:00,950
may played the guitar.
Um, I don't know. No,

1365
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,560
but he just didn't fucking die.
Like Ralphie May's in my death pool.

1366
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:09,540
I had to put one comic. This is a for
money one. It's a real death pool.

1367
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:14,010
Not like just a something we joke about.
This is for money. How much money?

1368
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:19,260
50 bucks each person for a year.
How many people is only 11 people.

1369
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:21,210
But next year we're going
to get this rock. And

1370
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,600
I've never had more fun than being
in a death pool. Really call a say.

1371
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,500
It's like having stocks.
Here's how they're checking the paper.

1372
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:34,110
Like you can get super offended when
you put them in your death pool though.

1373
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,210
Well I was,
I like,

1374
01:22:36,211 --> 01:22:39,780
I've had so many people I
front loaded celebrity rehab.

1375
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,530
So Tom Sizemore if you're
listening, Jeez, you know what?

1376
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:46,890
Fucking remember the of
crackle of that rock.

1377
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,970
Gwendolyn.
The self confidence.

1378
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:57,140
Get back with Heidi Fleiss I don't think
I need separate together cause I need

1379
01:22:57,271 --> 01:23:00,360
you to die by December 31st
cause I'm in seventh place.

1380
01:23:00,361 --> 01:23:04,800
My only death this year as Jeff Conaway
and I get some, Oh that guy died, huh?

1381
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,040
Yeah.
Well there's a bonus

1382
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,260
system like if you die,
if there's an overdose,

1383
01:23:08,261 --> 01:23:12,640
I get another 25 points for the
overdose and he was a scientologist.

1384
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:18,370
He went to that after celebrity rehabs
of Scientology is another fucking

1385
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,460
cytologist late in life
then very late, right? Yeah.

1386
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:25,400
Because Dr drew didn't
work so he's trying,

1387
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:29,290
can you pull up a video
of that guy all fucked up.

1388
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:32,140
Cause I heard that on celebrity rehab.
He was super fucked up.

1389
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:34,480
I heard it like a bunch of
different times but I never saw it.

1390
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:37,060
Did you ever see it? Who?
The guy that got it done.

1391
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,960
That's because I don't follow pop culture
celebrity Rehab because I hate Dr drew

1392
01:23:44,591 --> 01:23:49,591
was such a violent passion cause he's
a fucking scheister snake oil salesman

1393
01:23:51,011 --> 01:23:52,970
piece of shit.
I'll,

1394
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:58,000
I'll all on a fucking the new DVD that'll
come out as soon as I can pick a cover.

1395
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,410
Dr Drew is a good guy.
I liked back to drew.

1396
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:04,750
That's why it was a real nice guy.

1397
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,330
Think some more evil because
he believes what he's saying.

1398
01:24:07,331 --> 01:24:08,740
He says some crazy shit though.

1399
01:24:08,741 --> 01:24:13,450
He said some really ridiculous shit about
marijuana and the addiction properties

1400
01:24:13,451 --> 01:24:17,980
of it and the call effectiveness.
Again, he's, he's one of those like,

1401
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:22,180
no this is part of the fraud. But he's
kind of adjusted his stance on that,

1402
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:23,590
you know? And he's kind
of like, hey, you know,

1403
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,770
this is what always pisses me off about
people when they have this just his

1404
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:30,760
dance based on fucking the polls.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well you know,

1405
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:33,340
it's a personal freedom issue in anybody
that doesn't understand that it's

1406
01:24:33,341 --> 01:24:35,200
ridiculous.
And if it was really that bad,

1407
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:38,760
there'd be a bunch of fucking
bodies attributed to it.
And there is none. And My,

1408
01:24:38,761 --> 01:24:41,560
my real problem with it is that they
always have this whole late at night and

1409
01:24:41,561 --> 01:24:46,210
Breyer. It might be just on a fucking
slab. Dude. You're going to be great.

1410
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:50,440
Great. It's only five o'clock. I'm
good. Mad Time to three hours from now.

1411
01:24:50,441 --> 01:24:53,800
You'll be self deprecating and plugging.

1412
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:58,570
Bray Bray improv tonight. Yeah.
W one show. What time? 8:00 PM.

1413
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,220
If you're not listening to this,

1414
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:05,030
then you'll have no idea why the
show went like that. Is it APM? Yeah.

1415
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:10,080
I guess who's fucking like usually a pm
who's doing the show with you or your

1416
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:15,070
family? When's death? Five always
fight. Always five. Always ate. Yeah.

1417
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:17,830
You can't have a nutty
1145 show. I've got, I've,

1418
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,900
I've played like three Improv's now.
It was three out of two out of three.

1419
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:27,160
Three out of four where they hadn't
updated the fucking video screen.

1420
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:30,920
Stop that fucking red band
right now. It's making me, dude.

1421
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:34,210
You keep changing that and
it's distracting. It's told
me to show you the video.

1422
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,210
Search the video for Jeff Conaway
and so I was going to play a video.

1423
01:25:37,211 --> 01:25:42,040
That's Doug's fans
giant that I'm against.

1424
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:46,450
Okay. I love your head. Let's
play that Jeff Conway. We
thing. Let's see the other,

1425
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:47,303
you got it up there.

1426
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,630
Oh,
that's led Sappho.

1427
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,370
Oh, he's over there. Oh Wow.

1428
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,580
What's that music bro. Is that in
this? That's your fucking shitty music.

1429
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:12,230
That's really in your iPod. Oh, play this
back. So I got to hear this guy's voice.

1430
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,230
He's Jack. Dude. Put it early.

1431
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:20,180
Subtitling it for a reason.
He's not making. I know, but
I want to hear the noises.

1432
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,320
But that guy was fun. Eat. They showed,

1433
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:31,250
this is back when they glorified
the priests story. Look at him,

1434
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:35,570
dude.

1435
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:36,860
Drugs Suck.

1436
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,470
Killing myself. He said,
how would you do that?

1437
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,473
Yeah.

1438
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,630
Damn.
She muscle breaking him here.

1439
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:50,350
True

1440
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:54,370
with this.
Jesus was glasses.

1441
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,900
I can break them,
could slit my wrists with them.

1442
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:02,590
How amazing would it be if this guy didn't
do any drugs at all and this was like

1443
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:05,810
a role he was playing to try to let people
know he can still fucking act. Yeah.

1444
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,260
Yeah, and Dr Andrew is about to tell
him that fucking God will heal it.

1445
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:14,710
Doctor June doesn't say that, does
he? Yeah. He's a fucking 12 stepper.

1446
01:27:14,711 --> 01:27:17,840
That's what Aa is.
They put you into a 12 step program,

1447
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,360
but you're all about God.
I know why

1448
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:24,050
they do that. I think it's a
mechanism. I agree with you that it's,

1449
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,750
it's silly if you want to look at it

1450
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:30,970
as far as like whether it's
plausible and crying. Hold on.

1451
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:35,200
Same time and symbol guiding.
The audience talks to me.

1452
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,420
He's just, you laughing. Are you crying?
I turned my head. I said, I'm laughing.

1453
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:42,203
I'm crying.

1454
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:50,920
Okay, killer telephone. Thank you.
If that guy was really acting, it's,

1455
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:54,450
that's really wasn't how. It wasn't how
he really is. If he was just acting,

1456
01:27:54,451 --> 01:27:57,030
that would be brilliant. What a
great move. Somebody should do that.

1457
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,560
You should go on celebrity rehab. I'd
like that. Yeah, but he wasn't doing it.

1458
01:28:01,561 --> 01:28:04,200
But what a great idea it would be
to show people how good you can act.

1459
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:08,490
Go on celebrity rehab and just fake what
they stocked up. Oh, that's what they do.

1460
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:13,400
They've had people on there
for a marijuana addiction.
They just know they're,

1461
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:18,870
I think he said he's not doing it anymore,
which I hate because I love trashing.

1462
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,100
He every take shit.
We've got that new CNN show now.

1463
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:28,260
He's now he's trying to, you know, Oh, I'm
not just a doctor of sex and drugs now.

1464
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:31,440
Now I'm a doctor of life.
You know, like yeah,

1465
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,400
this sailor destiny or they become
celebrity doctors. Very tricky.

1466
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:40,020
Like that CNN guy that Sanjay Gupta,
I look actually thanked him on my,

1467
01:28:40,021 --> 01:28:44,370
no refunds. Really? Why? I
just thanked weird people.

1468
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,730
Just, it's a, it's a name
that sticks in your head.

1469
01:28:47,731 --> 01:28:52,340
That Syrup Sanjay Gupta next it
was Sunday. Stop with saying,

1470
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:55,320
Sanjay Gupta,
fucking just make up another name.

1471
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:01,020
So I put Sanjay Gupta back into the
universe instead of stuck in my like a

1472
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:02,580
fucking leper.

1473
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,270
That guy took a hundreds of thousands
of dollars for pharmaceutical companies.

1474
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:09,280
It takes over a hundred thousand
dollars a year. A piece of shit who,

1475
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,020
they're ridiculous.

1476
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:15,020
I can't stand those fucking talking
about fucking white people's pieces of

1477
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,430
Jacobs coming over here
and stealing our fucking,

1478
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:25,620
where's that at? White Guy. He
used to hate Sanjay goop. Did okay.

1479
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:30,030
Someone over here. It's taken
our corruption. Is that nonsense?

1480
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:34,830
Say or wow. You're right buddy.
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good. I just,

1481
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:38,320
I haven't been high and so fuck
it along. Is that what it is? Yes.

1482
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:41,100
To not smoke weed at all.
I don't start at all.

1483
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:44,730
That was like many years.
I've seen you turned down.

1484
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:48,020
We'd like every single time until this
is the first time I think I've ever seen.

1485
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:53,360
It's great, isn't it? I love it. I'm
intimidated. Why intimidated by, no, no.

1486
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:57,870
I'm intimidated. I would. He made me smoke
pot. Oh, it was going around the table.

1487
01:29:57,871 --> 01:30:00,470
I didn't want to be the uncool kid.
When you said you were,

1488
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,540
the only reason I even pass it to you
is cause you said before that I'm even

1489
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:07,950
willing to smoke pot. Well I, I really
want it. It's so fucking available.

1490
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:11,970
It's awesome. That's the thing.
I want to have a taste for it.

1491
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:16,680
I want to stop fucking drinking so much.
The edibles, he knew. He didn't know why.

1492
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:18,900
The animals have a totally
different effect man.

1493
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:23,040
It's like really like a strong
psychedelic. Yeah. You know
you eat cookies, eat me.

1494
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,710
He and he's fucking cookies at Joey takes.

1495
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,850
It's like every other drug or alcohol.
I like.

1496
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,400
It would be starting,
I'd be 18 years old,

1497
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:36,930
which is what I feel like right now where
I'm just fucking stupid and forgetting

1498
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:41,550
that we have to. I can entertain you
as we're fine. It's entertainment.

1499
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:45,420
You're fine. You're fine. I know what
you're saying, but the point is, yeah,

1500
01:30:45,421 --> 01:30:47,760
I don't want to have to
start with, we'd like, okay,

1501
01:30:47,761 --> 01:30:49,870
how much can I spoke before show?

1502
01:30:49,871 --> 01:30:52,710
It always amaze me that
you were so introspective.

1503
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:56,760
You're very introspective dude and you
don't have any ego problems and yet you

1504
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:57,541
didn't smoke weed.

1505
01:30:57,541 --> 01:31:01,340
I always thought that was
really interesting because
it always made because it

1506
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:05,130
was never a community thing. When
I get, when you trip with people,

1507
01:31:05,131 --> 01:31:06,420
you're all like weird together,

1508
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:10,860
we're all fucking dog in this and
every time I smoked weed it seemed like

1509
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:14,160
everyone was laughing
without me or at me and I,

1510
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:18,480
it wasn't never felt. Maybe you
gave up on it like way too early,

1511
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:21,120
maybe in your smoking with the wrong
people because if you're smoking them with

1512
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:24,480
us, it's just a giggle fest.
You know, we just spoke,

1513
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:28,410
we'd break down universe and laugh at
shit. Yeah, no smoking too much too,

1514
01:31:28,411 --> 01:31:30,690
but you're probably thinking it's like
a beer where you have to have many hits.

1515
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:34,740
Honestly, I think like even before a show,
one hit, usually it would be awesome,

1516
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:35,850
but he would want to do it,

1517
01:31:35,851 --> 01:31:40,851
but it's been so long since I actually
was like a teenage fucking weed smoker

1518
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:45,270
and realize they don't,
I've given it plenty of opportunities.

1519
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:48,270
The problem is there's two kinds of weed.
There's Endeca,

1520
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:51,250
which is what you always get.
That's what you normally get in Florida.

1521
01:31:51,251 --> 01:31:53,070
It's where you get,
if you don't know a guy,

1522
01:31:53,071 --> 01:31:54,960
it's what you get if you're not educated,

1523
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:57,810
indicates the stuff that makes you sleepy,
it makes you,

1524
01:31:58,290 --> 01:31:59,980
it's really bad for short term

1525
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,720
memory loss.
Sativas not so great for it either.

1526
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,300
Short term memories are a weird thing
with marijuana. It's almost like

1527
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,140
the thoughts are coming at you.
So

1528
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:11,680
I should be able to do when you can do a
fun. No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

1529
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:13,970
I'm just saying there's two
different kinds of weed that the,

1530
01:32:13,971 --> 01:32:16,270
the indigo is probably what
you were getting all the time.

1531
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:20,520
You probably weren't just saying
these are your legendary forgiven.

1532
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:24,100
A dude that smokes pot a lollipop and
he can't get off the fucking couch.

1533
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:26,950
All right.
Who was that telling me?

1534
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:29,600
I know a lot of people that if fucking

1535
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:36,560
tell him fucking yeah, it's supposed
to be bought. Like I couldn't move.

1536
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,980
Well, you know what it is, man.
I like it hard. I like, I'm like,

1537
01:32:39,981 --> 01:32:44,230
if it's going to hit me, it knocked
me on my ass. I did say it. Yeah.

1538
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:48,900
I want it to knock my my ass man. When
you take an edible, you know you want to,

1539
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,680
you want to really blast off into the,
the ultimate,

1540
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:55,390
like the furthest extent that you could.
You could,

1541
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:00,040
but you function like that the same
way I function shit faced drunk. Yeah.

1542
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:04,120
I don't always function perfectly around
like I got to because I spent 21 years

1543
01:33:04,121 --> 01:33:08,290
doing it. Like you're a fucking
a seasoned. We get hangovers.

1544
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,630
I just feel like shit all the
time. Every day, every second,

1545
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,900
no energy. I've quit smoking,
quit drinking coffee.

1546
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:19,810
Rather I quit drinking
coffee like for the kids,

1547
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,720
not just for a goof to see what
you don't like it when you,

1548
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,250
I just sleep with the TV on

1549
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:36,520
the shuttle bus to the other wing.

1550
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:43,780
I uh, I took off a few days and then I
had a cup of coffee and it hit me like a

1551
01:33:43,781 --> 01:33:46,690
lightning bolt. I was like, Whoa,
is this what coffee normally like?

1552
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,940
Cause usually I drink it.
I don't even feel it.

1553
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,130
It's like I'm so used to
just drinking coffee. Like,

1554
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:54,400
I'll have two cups of coffee in a day
and maybe even more when we're doing the

1555
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:57,640
podcast. I'll just, I'll, I'll pound
down three while we're sitting there.

1556
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,410
And then you don't realize that
your body just developed. Whoa.

1557
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,850
We need to process this shit nice and
quick and we need to develop a fucking

1558
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:06,520
tolerance for it. And then when
you don't have it for a while,

1559
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:10,270
your body sort of normalizes and then
you'll have a coffee and it's like,

1560
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:14,780
oh. Like it really jolts the
shit out of you. My nerve,

1561
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,450
I attribute it to alcohol,

1562
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:20,300
but my nervous system
when I drink coffee now,

1563
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:24,260
a lot of times I just fucking
visibly shake just from a,

1564
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:29,120
I drink decaf. Wow. But
I don't know if it's,

1565
01:34:29,121 --> 01:34:33,560
my nervous system is like that week
were just coffee affects it. You know,

1566
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,880
you're fucking, you get older, you think
everything is attributed, does something.

1567
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:42,890
Yeah. And I'm so happy when my
friends that don't drink all the time,

1568
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:47,420
don't remember anything
like shit. Well, yeah,

1569
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,460
mind a lot more than a lot of people.
I bet.

1570
01:34:49,461 --> 01:34:52,100
Just because of the fact you're always
writing and you're always performing.

1571
01:34:52,101 --> 01:34:54,920
You're always putting your act together
and organizing it and putting new shit

1572
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:58,070
together and putting out DVDs.
But you

1573
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,730
know, all of us, this doesn't
matter who you are, it's,

1574
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,000
it's eventually this thing is
going to shut off. Well, yeah,

1575
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:09,190
there's a water level high water mark
to how much fun you had and it has to be

1576
01:35:09,891 --> 01:35:13,210
more fun than that to
register. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh,

1577
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,990
I get drunk with you in Indianapolis,

1578
01:35:14,991 --> 01:35:19,730
but that's happened how many
fucking decades in a row.
Okay. I don't remember you.

1579
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,190
Did we fucking kill a guy that said,

1580
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:27,260
I don't that you'd have to be you
dancers supersede other levels. Oh,

1581
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:31,760
we went to a titty bar. Oh, did
I see tits there? Of course.

1582
01:35:31,761 --> 01:35:34,820
I remember you from 2002 fucking stupid.

1583
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,130
There's been too many
decades and too many. Yeah.

1584
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:41,320
It's interesting when you look at,

1585
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:46,160
I've likened it to like if you went to
your entire public schooling comedy,

1586
01:35:46,161 --> 01:35:47,840
21 years of comedy.

1587
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:53,330
It's like if you went to your entire
public schooling and then college and then

1588
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:55,340
a couple of years of Grad work,

1589
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:01,060
but you are shit faced every day for
your entire fucking schooling and in a

1590
01:36:01,821 --> 01:36:05,870
different school every week
and you come up and say,

1591
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:10,090
do you remember me from eighth grade?
He's a fucking million.

1592
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:12,780
Eighth grade's in this career.
And not only that, this just,

1593
01:36:12,781 --> 01:36:15,110
you think about the numbers of
people you meet every night.

1594
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,120
You're brains are not designed for that.

1595
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:21,520
Your brain is designed to meet like
50 people designed to have 100 handy.

1596
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,870
Cause Richard Jenny,
when I was,

1597
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:28,310
remember that the head of the class chick
I dated forever, the fucking Red Ed.

1598
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,140
I was dating her.
And so she had done a,

1599
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:36,510
a platypus man's like pilot for and and
so she'd be at the Improv and they'd

1600
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:41,030
like hugging,
kissing.

1601
01:36:41,031 --> 01:36:46,031
You know how Richard Jenny was a bit
of a ledge and she introduced me as her

1602
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:49,100
boyfriend. She goes, this
is my boyfriend Doug,

1603
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:52,970
and I'm like this fucking cunt with a
mullet and the corner. And he'd go, yeah.

1604
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,100
Anyway.
Anyway,

1605
01:36:54,101 --> 01:36:58,670
it's great to see you when I go out into
the thing and Sushi and late and he did

1606
01:36:58,671 --> 01:37:02,360
that a lot to me and then
he was hosting one night,

1607
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:04,760
the fucking Montreal,

1608
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:09,290
like one of the dirty you shows when
they are late night con tribes pieces.

1609
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:14,720
Yeah. It's the danger zone.
And he was emceeing Richard,

1610
01:37:14,721 --> 01:37:18,290
Jenny, you know the dangerous
Richard Jenny on the danger.

1611
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:22,040
Midnight fucking get
another 25 quids Audi.

1612
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:28,490
He says, uh, I've never seen this next
comic before and I went to let it go.

1613
01:37:28,491 --> 01:37:31,910
You fucking hit on my
girlfriend all the time.

1614
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:36,870
So you get like opening? Yeah, he, oh,
he introduces me. I've never seen it.

1615
01:37:36,871 --> 01:37:38,480
I've never met this comic before,

1616
01:37:38,481 --> 01:37:43,340
but I've heard good things that I
just opened with. He'd never met me.

1617
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:47,540
Fucking try to hammer my girlfriend in
front of me like I'm nothing all the time.

1618
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,860
Wow. He took it in good
spirit. Well till the end,

1619
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:54,500
until he killed himself because I said it.

1620
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:56,750
Do you think what really
ultimately triggered?

1621
01:37:56,790 --> 01:38:01,790
I'm pretty sure that was just a slow
burn by young fucking spirited Montreal.

1622
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:07,950
One ranch has destroyed us office team.
Did you like him as a comic?

1623
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:13,800
I, he had one of the fucking best bits
and I've tried to find it on the Internet

1624
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:14,850
about uh,

1625
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:19,830
something about playing the wreck
of the Edmund Fitzgerald parties.

1626
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:22,710
Oh yeah.
I try to find that on the fucking youtube.

1627
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:28,170
Hey. Yeah, it was a good comic man.

1628
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:30,980
I didn't know him as a human
being. I guess you did, but no,

1629
01:38:30,981 --> 01:38:33,010
I didn't break a great comment. I just, I,

1630
01:38:33,011 --> 01:38:37,800
I know and I was just poking
fun when I said that on
stage. Of course. I know, but,

1631
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:42,780
but then the point of that story is now
I'm Richard Jenny. Like people like you,

1632
01:38:42,781 --> 01:38:46,740
you don't fucking remember me. I opened
three like five times. Like I'm sorry,

1633
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,510
I know you when we're doing shots
of Jaeger meister during that time.

1634
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:55,170
Yeah. And maybe that memory
comes back, but you know,

1635
01:38:55,171 --> 01:38:58,400
a have a thing called Dunbar's number.
It's a,

1636
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:01,320
it's a theory that there's only
a certain amount of numbers,

1637
01:39:01,321 --> 01:39:03,780
a certain amount of human beings
you can keep inside of your head.

1638
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:07,980
You can only have like a friendship with
like 150 people and when it's more than

1639
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:10,680
150 people and you simply
don't have storage for it,

1640
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,450
so all the people that you meet,

1641
01:39:12,451 --> 01:39:15,140
I mean you're meeting hundreds of
people every fucking weekend. Your,

1642
01:39:15,141 --> 01:39:18,120
your brain is just overly burden and you
try to keep in touch these people and

1643
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:18,954
stay friends with them.

1644
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:23,010
And it's a building process because
when you first start getting any kind of

1645
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:24,000
fame,
you're like,

1646
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:29,010
oh you traveled from Youngstown while
I'll take you to fucking after hours.

1647
01:39:29,011 --> 01:39:31,410
And then, then they're, they
think they're your friends,

1648
01:39:31,411 --> 01:39:33,560
but then you get more fans.

1649
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:38,010
So there there's a value to them because
their fans and you've never had that,

1650
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:40,650
which is a shitty thing to say,
but it's the truth.

1651
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,630
Then you get more fans and you're like,
all right,

1652
01:39:42,631 --> 01:39:45,330
I'm not taking you to fucking
breakfast. They were done. I see it.

1653
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:49,740
Cause now I have actual fan base and
then you have too many fans and then you

1654
01:39:49,741 --> 01:39:53,540
don't even understand why they like you
because you hate yourself. And then, uh,

1655
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:58,800
oh sorry, go to Douglas.

1656
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:04,170
You don't hate yourself. No, no. I was
trying to bring that to an absurd place,

1657
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:09,120
but the, you can't be friends
with your fans on some level.

1658
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:11,820
It's a tricky thing when your fans,
especially,

1659
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,820
you got a bunch of fucking psychos
fallen, you know, like I, there's,

1660
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:16,680
I am not a forum suicide,

1661
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:19,920
a suicide letter I
going to pose and really

1662
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:26,610
we got a 4th of July where and w I had my
lawyer of fucking fact check it and it,

1663
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:31,950
it's a real suicide. Yeah. He's to kill
themselves and send a letter to you. Yeah,

1664
01:40:31,951 --> 01:40:35,880
they sent us letters. Read. I
wanted to see it before, you know,

1665
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:39,690
it was nice.
It was my friend.

1666
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:43,140
Is it a picture of 4th of
July party at the house?

1667
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,610
So I get this fan mail. I always put
my address on the fucking website.

1668
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:52,530
Hey steel stuff. Hey today it's
Friday, right? Whatever it is. Tuesday,

1669
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:55,210
steal something from work right now.

1670
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,170
Podcast listeners steal
something from work.

1671
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:02,140
It doesn't have to have any
value to some piece of shit.

1672
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:07,090
Take your fucking coworkers picture of
their knees of their desk and mail it on

1673
01:41:07,091 --> 01:41:12,091
the company dime right now to
Bingo at two 12 van Dyke Street,

1674
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:18,850
like Dick Van Dyke to 12
van Dyke. Bisbee, Arizona,

1675
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:21,790
eight five six oh three so I put this,

1676
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:26,791
I'll do this every now and then on radio
or on my Facebook just because bingos

1677
01:41:26,801 --> 01:41:31,390
retarded and she never understands
why all these packages are showing up.

1678
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:36,400
Post it notes. Okay. Some
guys sent his his phone,

1679
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,770
I don't know if it's Fedex
or ups or the guy wrote,

1680
01:41:42,771 --> 01:41:45,400
he said this is my last day on the job,
so I'm going to send it.

1681
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:49,960
He sent us scanner. That's so like
obsolete. They can't replace them.

1682
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:54,100
There it goes. So it has value and
it was quitting his job anyway,

1683
01:41:54,101 --> 01:41:59,101
so he sent something ups or
Fedex on their dime as a fuck you

1684
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:05,350
Jesus Christ. That's a fucking funny.
So what do you do with all this stuff?

1685
01:42:05,351 --> 01:42:07,930
How much, what do you have
stored? Oh, we haven't done,

1686
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:12,280
it's usually nothing of value.
I don't like I fucking ups scanner.

1687
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:13,990
I drop everything at the thrift store.

1688
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,130
I think most people's like tee
shirts that you get from, oh,

1689
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:20,690
so you just take him to mean commerce.
My t shirt,

1690
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:23,530
a company and you go on
a tee shirt companies.

1691
01:42:23,531 --> 01:42:25,540
Have you noticed how many
tee-shirt companies there are?

1692
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:28,840
Everybody has a chance to teacher,
especially in the MMA world. That's,

1693
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:31,840
I really noticed it.
Sell it to fucking the MMA world.

1694
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:35,530
Cause guys with fucking beer guts.
Don't wear a tee shirts. I wear layers.

1695
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:41,080
Do you fuck with your clothes off?
I don't fuck anymore done.

1696
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:44,500
You're just lost all,
what was the last time you tapped?

1697
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:50,470
What prob occasionally you do
narcotics and they go, Oh hey, yeah,

1698
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:53,950
I have a sex drive. And
then you've, so yeah,

1699
01:42:53,951 --> 01:42:56,860
probably a Portland

1700
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:05,650
once a year, but it wasn't like we'd
just start laughing in the middle ages.

1701
01:43:05,651 --> 01:43:10,190
This is so ridiculous. Wow. It's,
it's just, yeah, it's such a nonevent.

1702
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:14,290
It feels fucking trivial. What
does that like? That's a weird,

1703
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,080
weird feeling.
What does I like?

1704
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,460
It's like a, if you just didn't,
you weren't hungry anymore.

1705
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,230
You want to eat no good.

1706
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:32,200
But it's funny how many people their
lives are defined by that lost in that

1707
01:43:32,201 --> 01:43:34,270
passion and how important it is for them.
Well,

1708
01:43:34,271 --> 01:43:38,710
you do see where like my comedy
is fucking slouched since then,

1709
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,060
but you realize that you,

1710
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:45,140
you boil it all down to what was the root
cause of all this desire was pussy and

1711
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:48,430
then, yeah, and then you get,

1712
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:52,070
and then you fucking blow a load
on her tits and you go, hmm,

1713
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,110
isn't there a better
way to say I like you?

1714
01:43:55,150 --> 01:43:58,680
Like isn't there something that's
not, if she likes it, yeah,

1715
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:00,320
she likes it and you like it.

1716
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:05,180
It's pretty nature's fuck job where now
you can think pass nature where you go,

1717
01:44:05,181 --> 01:44:10,180
all right, I see what nature does, but
nature's fucked. Do you just hire you?

1718
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:13,730
Where are you going to look at the
actual fucking planet earth and go,

1719
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:17,990
you fucked up.
I know it's a pump has attitude,

1720
01:44:17,991 --> 01:44:22,250
but I guess to say that nature
is fucked and we're right.

1721
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:27,650
Well, we are natural. We have logic.
We're, we're natural too, man.

1722
01:44:27,651 --> 01:44:29,000
That's one thing that
people don't consider.

1723
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:32,380
I think that everything we do is
ultimately very natural. Natural.

1724
01:44:32,381 --> 01:44:35,810
The fucking the chemicals you're
promoting or natural cause it came from

1725
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:39,980
somewhere in the earth. No fucking
aliens, substances. Everything is natural.

1726
01:44:39,981 --> 01:44:44,920
Even chemicals. It's true. Yeah. I
think behavior is as well. I think uh,

1727
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:45,201
the,

1728
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:50,060
the people are so fucked up because
our organism is designed to promote a

1729
01:44:50,061 --> 01:44:53,450
purpose and that purpose seems
to be technologically related.

1730
01:44:53,451 --> 01:44:57,610
It seems to be about Baz
purposes to get me a cocktail.

1731
01:44:57,620 --> 01:45:01,400
Little Lady. I'll take one too.
Fellow do me another one of those.

1732
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:05,510
I'll take one of your items. Take
one of your diet. Fucking off brands.

1733
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:11,150
Seven ups. You went to food clubs,
special food clubs. Seven like keep dying.

1734
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:15,440
I keep diet for the porn stars.
That's what he said.

1735
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:18,260
But he's got like some fucking offbrand.
Sam's Cola.

1736
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:20,870
He told me he keeps energy
drinks for the porn stars.

1737
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:25,130
They don't want an energy drink. Can I
get an energy drink? Oh No, actually no.

1738
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:29,270
You have Vitaly vodka.
I drank a red bull and vodka.

1739
01:45:29,271 --> 01:45:32,330
I tried to get rid of that
fucking Yeager meister burden.

1740
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:35,810
Just saying he agar meister on stage.
You feel like I'm fucking,

1741
01:45:35,811 --> 01:45:39,290
I'm 44 year old man
saying Yeager my Easter.

1742
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:44,570
Is that a bad thing? Just
feeling some point, you know
at some point where you go,

1743
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:48,210
I'm too old to do this. You've
had those moments. Yeah,

1744
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:52,550
when you're doing shots but somehow or
another whiskey you could be 60 and still

1745
01:45:52,551 --> 01:45:56,500
get a shot of whiskey. You're doing
Jaeger bombs and you're 60 sac commander,

1746
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,770
but any class,
but I've,

1747
01:45:57,780 --> 01:46:02,780
I've grown a taste for all this shit
where it like I was all the beer that I

1748
01:46:03,471 --> 01:46:08,471
like is just shit horrible corporate
beer and I watched football too.

1749
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:11,630
So what? Embrace it. But no, the, the,

1750
01:46:11,631 --> 01:46:16,520
the fact that you see all the ads are
geared towards the dumbest people alive

1751
01:46:16,521 --> 01:46:18,320
and you go,
I like your product.

1752
01:46:18,321 --> 01:46:23,321
Why do you make me feel like an asshole
for fucking having a giant ad campaign

1753
01:46:23,491 --> 01:46:27,080
saying that the fucking label tells
me when it's cold because I don't have

1754
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:31,250
fucking temperature. It's,
but that's what I like. Shit,

1755
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:35,120
enjoy shit. I'm, I'm,
I'm, I'm at terms with it.

1756
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,580
I just hate when it's marketed towards me.

1757
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:39,590
I know it's talking about when
it treats you like you're dumb,

1758
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:42,680
but there's a lot of shit. That's
cool. You know I like muscle cars.

1759
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:45,860
I know they're stupid. I know that
dumb. I don't care. I like, I like,

1760
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:50,040
I have a Shelby Mustang. I liked the way
it sounds. I, when I hit the gas, he goes,

1761
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:51,413
mom,

1762
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:55,140
I'm very aware that we're on a planet
and this planet is a part of a galaxy and

1763
01:46:55,141 --> 01:46:58,680
this galaxy,
I'm enjoying this fucking Mustang.

1764
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:03,340
You know one I didn't ask to be here.
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Fuck you and your,

1765
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:05,430
I didn't sue my mother.

1766
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:09,870
She's the one who had the fucking gall
to create life without its consent. Yeah.

1767
01:47:09,871 --> 01:47:12,480
That's my attitude towards anybody that
tells you that you're supposed to be

1768
01:47:12,481 --> 01:47:14,190
really involved in our political system.
Hey,

1769
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:17,220
and we're born into a fucking system
that we have no control over and it's

1770
01:47:17,221 --> 01:47:19,230
absolutely completely fucked.
It's really,

1771
01:47:19,231 --> 01:47:22,530
you want me to really get involved and
invested in this? Is that really fixable?

1772
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:27,900
Yeah, no, you make your own fucking
government. It's what the Amish do.

1773
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:31,740
It's what gangs do.
You make your own fucking reality,

1774
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:34,950
but then the federal government is always
the big daddy looking over the whole

1775
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:39,060
time that you learn to avoid the
same way you avoid fucking scorpions.

1776
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:42,960
Arizona shake out my
shit before I put it on.

1777
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:47,070
How often he gets scorpions.
Well, not often enough,

1778
01:47:47,071 --> 01:47:49,110
but if it's been sitting there for awhile,

1779
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:53,970
you shake it out cause you
know your environment. Yeah,
exactly. The point is, yeah,

1780
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,300
the same way you avoid every
other fucking obstacle.

1781
01:47:57,301 --> 01:47:58,590
You would just avoid the government.

1782
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:02,250
You vote for Ron Paul and it makes you
feel good and it's nothing to do on a

1783
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:06,570
Tuesday anyway and it makes it
theirs can't start a compound now.

1784
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:10,710
They don't let you do that. Can't
do that. Don't call it a compound.

1785
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:13,590
That's the thing is people
can have guns in Hong Kong.

1786
01:48:13,591 --> 01:48:15,630
The church should be fucking like,
Ooh,

1787
01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:20,310
I'm going to get on fucking radio until
everyone's coming to my copout Waco.

1788
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,440
You know what? Just fucking shut up.
Go down and fucking property's cheap.

1789
01:48:25,441 --> 01:48:28,500
And Texas. You get a whole
compound and just say, Hey,

1790
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:32,930
do you think you'll ever mind
fucking proselytize? Yeah,

1791
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:36,420
you can get plenty of pussy just running
it that way. Yeah. You know she crazy.

1792
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:40,560
Everyone that's in a fucking criminal
element has to be so like they take it too

1793
01:48:40,561 --> 01:48:43,320
far. Yeah. What gets him to the
party ultimately drowns them.

1794
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,280
They drown in their own desire to occupy.

1795
01:48:47,281 --> 01:48:51,560
Wall Street would dress up like Wall
Street, so there were indecipherable.

1796
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:56,850
It's a fucking thrift store.
You got to cut your hair.

1797
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:01,200
It's a lot of dudes with dreadlocks.
Exactly. So commit yourself to the cause.

1798
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:04,170
You know what? That's fucking
hell. That's why I love anonymous.

1799
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:08,550
Like if they fucking sold
merge, I'd buy, I buy a shirt.

1800
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:11,370
I was thinking Brian should
do a guy Fawkes mask day.

1801
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:13,470
We wear the mask fucking anonymous.

1802
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:16,500
Like people like that are
in there doing something.

1803
01:49:16,501 --> 01:49:17,880
They're fucking with the system.

1804
01:49:17,881 --> 01:49:22,040
Wiki leaks is fucking with this
system and you're fucking g,

1805
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:25,890
you're going to camp. You're going to walk
for a cure is what you're going to do.

1806
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:30,060
What they are little dude
is there represents a giant
numbers. Who Do we need?

1807
01:49:30,061 --> 01:49:33,270
Soldiers. You need a non like you
need leaders down fucking. Yeah,

1808
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:34,860
but the problem is they go after leaders.

1809
01:49:34,861 --> 01:49:38,310
And the beautiful thing about this whole
occupy Wall Street thing is there's no

1810
01:49:38,311 --> 01:49:43,200
leaders. That's the beautiful thing about
it. But there's no, there's no guidance,

1811
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:46,590
there's no guide leaders.
There's a pretty cohesive message.

1812
01:49:46,620 --> 01:49:47,950
The point it could be done

1813
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:50,380
if you like. Yes. Men. The style,

1814
01:49:50,381 --> 01:49:54,430
like there's so many that you
see that fucking, it's like,

1815
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,320
it's like a Dane Cook audience.

1816
01:49:56,321 --> 01:50:00,220
Without a comic we you
see that fucking need for,

1817
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:05,470
you could turn this force into something
and they're such fucking dimwits like

1818
01:50:05,471 --> 01:50:06,340
any movement,

1819
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:11,070
most of the populace is going to be
a fucking dimwit and they need to,

1820
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:12,041
well,
you know,

1821
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:17,041
I mean if you want to go back and read
the conspiracy theories of the 60s and

1822
01:50:17,231 --> 01:50:21,730
the 70s that the idea was that they were
engineering our civilization to be the

1823
01:50:21,731 --> 01:50:25,450
stupid and that they were engineering
the poor neighborhoods that have shit

1824
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:26,860
education and keeping the,

1825
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,360
the priorities of education at a minimum
so that they can continue to run people.

1826
01:50:31,361 --> 01:50:34,930
Because most people are too fucking
stupid to realize what's going on.

1827
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:38,290
As long as they can keep
this charade going. Yes.

1828
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,640
That's why it's all falling apart.

1829
01:50:39,641 --> 01:50:43,390
It's because the Internet now as allowed
pretty much everybody to see what's

1830
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:44,830
really happening in the world.

1831
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:48,460
See where the real numbers are
going for what Alex Jones sees.

1832
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:50,180
He sees something you can't even

1833
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:54,880
z on the Internet.
The lesson can I 91st unless you buy gold,

1834
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:56,710
ladies and gentlemen.
Right now,

1835
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:01,740
they have baskets out in the desert
where they're looking to put your goal

1836
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:06,610
setting or McCain, you
aren't disgraced, sir.

1837
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:10,820
I remember when we were talking about
occupy all day and I said something silly

1838
01:51:10,821 --> 01:51:13,640
like about how I think
they should move to the uh,

1839
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,170
the trees and like make an easy
walk village, I guess. Exactly.

1840
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:21,590
That's exactly what happened before
the pocket was saying that the God,

1841
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:25,220
that guy's a guy from fear factor. Oh
yes. Yeah. Oh, he's on fear factors.

1842
01:51:25,221 --> 01:51:29,870
His name is Shane. That's crazy. He was on
fear factor with his check. So that's a,

1843
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:32,330
they're creating all confused.

1844
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:37,950
That's ridiculous. Yeah. It's a very
strange thing, man. It's a weird movement.

1845
01:51:37,951 --> 01:51:40,470
There's all these people camped
out, man, and a lot of them,

1846
01:51:40,471 --> 01:51:43,050
this is where the foot they need,
why do you need a fucking movement?

1847
01:51:43,051 --> 01:51:47,360
That's what nay. I'm Stan hope
you don't need a fucking route.

1848
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:51,420
But to me this is an exciting time.
This is really interesting.

1849
01:51:51,421 --> 01:51:54,070
I don't know what's happening,
but to me I see, oh,

1850
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:58,260
these numbers of people moving and
these numbers of people protesting or

1851
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,550
unprecedented.

1852
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:04,700
We've never had a public display of how
fucking pissed people are like this.

1853
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:09,690
A public display of how many people are
saying this is in snow. It's insane.

1854
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,230
It's amazing. I know it. It needs
to be corralled, but it's going to,

1855
01:52:13,231 --> 01:52:15,210
it's going to eventually,
first of all,

1856
01:52:15,211 --> 01:52:18,630
the real unfortunate aspect of
it at all is that they're trying,

1857
01:52:18,631 --> 01:52:21,170
as hard as the Caesar's will says,

1858
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:26,180
his pizza of occupy Wall Street brought
to you by all of the most unfortunate

1859
01:52:28,381 --> 01:52:30,390
and aspect of it is that
if it keeps growing,

1860
01:52:30,391 --> 01:52:33,000
they're going to keep pushing it back and
eventually something's going to break.

1861
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:34,890
You know, and they're going
to push the boat. But I mean,

1862
01:52:34,891 --> 01:52:36,420
we've already had people getting hurt,

1863
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:41,190
people getting hit with tear gas canisters
and their fucking face flash grenades.

1864
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:44,400
We've already had a lot of that shit
happen. But if it keeps growing,

1865
01:52:44,401 --> 01:52:46,070
it's going to keep and
they're going to have to push

1866
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,200
back. I mean it's, it's, it's
almost inevitable. But what I,

1867
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:53,360
so what happens then? That's, it becomes
a real problem. Where does it go?

1868
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:56,550
No one's explained to me
what the fucking fight is.

1869
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,250
The fight is that the system's fuck.

1870
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:00,760
The fight is that people
didn't want all these bailouts.

1871
01:53:00,761 --> 01:53:05,090
They don't think that all that is such
a broad thing. It's absolutely broad.

1872
01:53:05,091 --> 01:53:07,730
That's what we've known for years.
You're right,

1873
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:12,540
because do general general ignorant
reaction or not, not ignorant. Um,

1874
01:53:12,670 --> 01:53:16,970
the mob action is ignorant. The reaction
it is, I don't want to say ignorant,

1875
01:53:16,971 --> 01:53:18,260
but what it is is it's,
it's a,

1876
01:53:18,261 --> 01:53:23,261
it's an unfocused anger with a good
percentage of the people who have a clear

1877
01:53:23,901 --> 01:53:25,630
idea. What's the problem? Well,

1878
01:53:25,631 --> 01:53:28,390
there's a lot of them that
absolutely running around,

1879
01:53:28,391 --> 01:53:32,600
like from a completely
military point of view. Yes.

1880
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:36,130
You need a bunch of stupid people who
don't really know what's going on. Well,

1881
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:38,900
y'all fortunately they get
interviewed by the press.

1882
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:43,580
You need fucking numbers and most of the
populace is dumb as shit. You fucking,

1883
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:46,390
you have to get numbers. Not
only that, there's also, um,

1884
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:51,430
a real tactic of agent provocateurs where
there's cops that I know that's up and

1885
01:53:51,771 --> 01:53:55,670
go in and start shit and then arrested.
Why don't they do the fucking same thing?

1886
01:53:55,671 --> 01:53:56,504
Bag,
dress,

1887
01:53:56,650 --> 01:54:01,370
dress like a cop without going
to jail without the insignia.

1888
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:03,110
Yeah.
Put on fucking riot gear.

1889
01:54:03,111 --> 01:54:06,770
Why are you sitting out there or I'm
a week hippie dress up like a fucking

1890
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:11,570
raider fan. Johnny fucking
Mad Max Element. Darth Vader.

1891
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:15,620
Yeah. Be as intimidating as that.
More intimidating than the cops. Yeah.

1892
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:17,360
Put on the attire of a guy.
Really?

1893
01:54:17,361 --> 01:54:22,310
I just write her for fucking occupy Wall
Street and not against them. I'm not,

1894
01:54:22,311 --> 01:54:23,840
I don't know what they're for.
Yeah,

1895
01:54:23,841 --> 01:54:26,690
the system's fucked and I'm glad that
you're out there doing something.

1896
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:31,070
I just want to fucking write some ideas
for you rather than make it so fucking

1897
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:33,680
obvious. I'm a hippie. Well,

1898
01:54:33,681 --> 01:54:37,100
don't you think that's just inevitable
whenever you have any sort of a gathering,

1899
01:54:37,110 --> 01:54:39,550
that's why I want to join.
I'd rather be gonna do.

1900
01:54:39,551 --> 01:54:40,760
You're gonna kick the people that suck.

1901
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:44,950
I don't like comedy and go out and go
hair and here's a better sign. Yeah,

1902
01:54:44,970 --> 01:54:49,100
we are the 99% all right, everyone else
has that sign. I want to fucking help.

1903
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:52,790
Let's make this funnier,
funnier revolution.

1904
01:54:52,791 --> 01:54:56,060
Like how is that going to help you get
rid of all the retards? How's that?

1905
01:54:56,061 --> 01:54:59,290
Doesn't, there's no way to get rid of the
retards. There's no way to an educator.

1906
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:01,550
You can fucking educate your kids.

1907
01:55:01,551 --> 01:55:05,630
You have two kids now and you can pretend
like you're going to have an influence

1908
01:55:05,631 --> 01:55:08,870
on their life, but you can have
an influence on my life for sure.

1909
01:55:09,230 --> 01:55:11,660
When you're not going to, yeah, they're
not going to run the whole thing.

1910
01:55:11,661 --> 01:55:13,610
It's an independent human being.
Fucking Patton.

1911
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:18,611
Oswald had the great bit about how kids
always rebel against their parents.

1912
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:23,360
So I'm going to be the worst parent in
the world and we're going to have Phil

1913
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,390
Collins, no jacket required
framed on the mantle piece.

1914
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:31,310
So my kids turned out cool.
That's funny.

1915
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:35,710
Yeah, it's a weird idea. You know,

1916
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:38,870
trying to figure out what way
to push and pull your kids.

1917
01:55:38,871 --> 01:55:42,230
You see them reacting to you though. So
that's the strangest thing. You see them,

1918
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:42,711
you know,

1919
01:55:42,711 --> 01:55:46,350
like getting upset that you telling
them that they can't do something and so

1920
01:55:46,351 --> 01:55:48,990
they, they rebound the other way.
You know, you could see that,

1921
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:53,790
that pattern development really early
where a lot of us, you know, I mean,

1922
01:55:53,791 --> 01:55:55,620
I don't know how you were raised,
but I met your mom.

1923
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:58,710
You're the only friend I have that
I'd don't dismiss once they have kids

1924
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:04,500
because you have kids like a fucking,
like a terrarium project.

1925
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:09,210
When I'm on a fucking control the growth,
I'm going to monitor it.

1926
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,850
You're not a parent.
I'm a parent.

1927
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:15,180
I mean I can just know you are by
enjoy same way. You've never been like,

1928
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:19,830
we never met your girlfriend.
I like, I'm going the, well,

1929
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:23,750
I guess most of us had the guy that
brings up girl. Nope. Girlfriend.

1930
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,560
My whole personal life is a,

1931
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:29,400
it's almost like your friends or TMZ.
I know.

1932
01:56:29,401 --> 01:56:33,150
I'm going to keep everything private.
La, he know me as well as most people.

1933
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:38,160
Well that was, I never met.
Exactly. Exactly. Jessica. Yeah.

1934
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:42,840
Tone. Don't say names. Oh Shit.
Sorry. It's too little. Fuck.

1935
01:56:42,841 --> 01:56:45,050
All right, well we haven't talked
in a while. It's all right.

1936
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,890
She doesn't go by her married name.

1937
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:54,660
Um, yeah, sorry. Yeah, no, I tell
people everything. I just don't,

1938
01:56:54,661 --> 01:56:55,830
I don't tell the Internet everything.

1939
01:56:57,910 --> 01:57:02,100
You and I have a never
comedy, friendship, you know,

1940
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:06,900
but yet don't, no, no, no, no.
And you're just comedy life.

1941
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:11,280
Like I, when you said, hey, I'll come into
the UFC and I go, I don't like that man.

1942
01:57:11,281 --> 01:57:14,940
There's a lot of dudes that the integrate
these girls that they're dating into

1943
01:57:14,941 --> 01:57:18,210
their fucking comedy life and they bring
him everywhere and you know the problem

1944
01:57:18,211 --> 01:57:22,560
with that change their personality,
which I've seen since then. It's weird.

1945
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:26,250
It gets weird, you know, I, I've seen
it. I mean, it's nothing wrong. I mean,

1946
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:28,320
you can take your chicken anywhere.
There's nothing wrong with that,

1947
01:57:28,321 --> 01:57:31,440
but I don't think you should all,
you should always do things together.

1948
01:57:31,441 --> 01:57:34,350
I think there's nothing wrong
with having really separate lives.

1949
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:37,820
Bingo is the only thing is fucking
friend in the world. Watch.

1950
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:40,770
It works for you guys. Yeah. It's
like whatever works, you know,

1951
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:45,600
for what me has always worked is you
got to separate church and state for W.

1952
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:50,370
Yeah. I know. That's always been, there's
always been kind of a border, but no,

1953
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:52,950
it's never ever border, dude. No.

1954
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
It's nothing you introduced to into and
you're just so alien from like my shit,

1955
01:58:00,151 --> 01:58:03,460
if that's what you mean. Yeah. Yeah.

1956
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:09,060
I'm getting back, coming back. I'm
good. Gonna come back. You feeling it?

1957
01:58:09,061 --> 01:58:12,090
Do you want an energy drink to push
you over the title? No, I'm good.

1958
01:58:12,091 --> 01:58:16,470
I have a cocktail. I fee. I
just, you're centering. Yeah.

1959
01:58:16,471 --> 01:58:20,360
My fucking head has been
in so many places when you,

1960
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:23,550
when you're just like,
oh, what's a microphone?

1961
01:58:23,551 --> 01:58:27,510
And it was just fucking high shit.
All right.

1962
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:32,040
You understand what a microphone is and
I'm not really baffled anymore by the

1963
01:58:32,041 --> 01:58:35,240
fact that we can talk to
a million people of CBE.

1964
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,930
Zick we're all in the same room.

1965
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:39,630
I think it's amazing how well
you've actually held it together.

1966
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:43,690
I could ever podcast showrooming
he did an amazing job.

1967
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:47,080
This, um, occupy Wall Street thing.

1968
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:50,050
This is why I pulled this article up
cause I knew we were going to talk about

1969
01:58:50,051 --> 01:58:53,590
this. This is, uh, the National
Defense Authorization Act.

1970
01:58:53,591 --> 01:58:55,600
This is what I was talking about earlier,
where they're,

1971
01:58:55,601 --> 01:59:00,601
they're literally going to define the
US homeland as a battlefield and make us

1972
01:59:01,061 --> 01:59:05,830
citizens subject to military apprehension
and detainment for life without access

1973
01:59:05,831 --> 01:59:09,190
to a trial or attorney. This
is amazing. I mean, this is,

1974
01:59:09,191 --> 01:59:12,130
there's something that they've crafted.
This is another high thing,

1975
01:59:12,131 --> 01:59:16,030
but you're acting like law matters. No,
I'm not, but I'm acting like this is,

1976
01:59:16,031 --> 01:59:20,270
I mean it's actually cops beat you
every fucking day. What? Oh, it's in,

1977
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:24,200
but it's against the constitution.
Like no one cares that such a,

1978
01:59:24,201 --> 01:59:26,740
but they do care. I mean, people
were really freaking out about that.

1979
01:59:26,741 --> 01:59:30,940
If you're one guy that occasionally
brings something to a supreme court every

1980
01:59:30,941 --> 01:59:33,640
four years and they go, you
were right, you were fucked.

1981
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:38,560
And then he gets nothing out
of the battle. But in your
general day, you, sorry.

1982
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:40,470
Well,
this is what this is,

1983
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:45,070
is trying to turn the US into a place
where they can have the military patrol

1984
01:59:45,071 --> 01:59:48,720
things. So the military, which control
things like occupy Wall Street there,

1985
01:59:48,730 --> 01:59:52,660
they're preparing for civil unrest and
they're preparing to do it legally.

1986
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:57,010
And what they're preparing to do is to
make the United States a battleground so

1987
01:59:57,011 --> 02:00:00,100
that when you are in a situation
like occupy Wall Street,

1988
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,710
you're literally like an enemy combatant.

1989
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:06,190
But they've been doing that for
10 years or putting it on paper.

1990
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,060
And that's what's really crazy.
And they're trying,

1991
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:13,030
there's so blatant about it that
they're literally putting this on paper.

1992
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:13,661
You know,
they're,

1993
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:16,960
they're trying to pass this through and
people are fucking freaking out about it,

1994
02:00:16,961 --> 02:00:19,870
man. Well that's good. Yeah. Finally.

1995
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,860
But it's still amazing that this is
something that they're so fucking stupid.

1996
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:26,110
These people live in a different age.

1997
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:28,900
They live in an age of the media
reporting things, you know,

1998
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:32,830
and when these things get out on the
Internet and CNN is not covering it and

1999
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:34,360
Washington Times isn't covering it,

2000
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:37,240
but you can get it on your fucking
computer and go, what is this shit?

2001
02:00:37,241 --> 02:00:40,020
Is this real? And then you make some
phone calls and you'll find out it is.

2002
02:00:40,021 --> 02:00:41,720
And everybody freaks the fuck out.
And,

2003
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:45,640
and you know he's asked her
life miserable like scares me,

2004
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:50,230
scares me, scares me. They
shouldn't be allowed to do that.

2005
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,000
They shouldn't be allowed to bring,
look,

2006
02:00:52,001 --> 02:00:54,910
there's a reason why people are
freaking out and these people need to be

2007
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:57,070
addressed. They need, you need to
figure out how to deal with that.

2008
02:00:57,071 --> 02:00:58,960
And the way to deal with
it isn't a fucking tank.

2009
02:00:59,090 --> 02:01:00,460
And it says in Tiananmen Square,

2010
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:03,680
there's supposed to be the United
States and at the end of the day change

2011
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:07,840
without like drastic. Why is that? But
it isn't. They were internet drastic.

2012
02:01:07,841 --> 02:01:09,240
The Internet is the most drastic fuck.

2013
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:12,220
Nothing can ever be introduced
to a society ever. People have,

2014
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:15,620
they have to pay their fucking mortgage.
You,

2015
02:01:15,621 --> 02:01:20,621
you see people that are like rolling their
own cigarettes and if they don't give

2016
02:01:21,041 --> 02:01:23,350
a fuck about some law passing,

2017
02:01:23,351 --> 02:01:26,080
they're trying to fucking feed fat kids.

2018
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:30,040
So when everyone's down,
it was like, what, when?

2019
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:34,860
That's how revolutions there is no
fucking revolution of the middle class is.

2020
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:39,410
It was actually when the middle class
rose up and said, I think you're right.

2021
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:41,880
In a certain sense,
and I think it has your cynical,

2022
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:45,020
they're cynical viewpoint is
pragmatical is, I mean it's normal.

2023
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:47,600
It's based on data, based on
history. You're absolutely right,

2024
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:52,350
but it's not based on the best that
people are capable of the best to keep

2025
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:54,890
people are capable of.
They're capable of much more than that.

2026
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,190
It's just that we can't pull it off on
a mass scale. We're just not good at it,

2027
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,750
but we were capable of it.

2028
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:03,050
We're more than capable of pretty
fucking awesome behavior on an individual

2029
02:02:03,051 --> 02:02:03,830
basis.

2030
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:08,090
And then the key is trying to figure out
how that can be relayed to the entire

2031
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:09,530
population as an ethic.

2032
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:12,200
And the only way that's going to ever
work is if people feel like the system

2033
02:02:12,201 --> 02:02:14,930
that they operate under is fair
and right now they clearly don't.

2034
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:18,020
Right now that people feel like they
look at all the money that's going into

2035
02:02:18,021 --> 02:02:21,680
these CEOs that have been fucking what
he looks at that they do, they do.

2036
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,830
They look at the numbers, they
can help it. That's your fan base.

2037
02:02:24,831 --> 02:02:28,580
Don't ever confuse your fan base
with what lives in the fucking world,

2038
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:32,960
in the dark houses and the fuck. You're
right. You're right. 66 you're right.

2039
02:02:32,961 --> 02:02:33,800
For the most part,

2040
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:36,530
they don't ever think about which
plenty of people that do though.

2041
02:02:36,531 --> 02:02:38,540
The people that are informed of that
should be the ones that you're paying

2042
02:02:38,541 --> 02:02:39,201
attention to,
right?

2043
02:02:39,201 --> 02:02:43,470
Water Cooler talk where they've fucking
mimic bumper stickers. Yes. That,

2044
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:48,680
but they have no idea what a fucking
CEO is or how it affects their,

2045
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:49,521
you're absolutely right.

2046
02:02:49,521 --> 02:02:53,990
One of fucking get Velveeta cheese for
their fucking kid and if it's a dollar

2047
02:02:53,991 --> 02:02:57,000
off, they're happy and they're
not even poor. You're right.

2048
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:00,620
That's a real question though, is why
are they liked that? And the question is,

2049
02:03:00,621 --> 02:03:02,750
are they like that because
of nature or nurture.

2050
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:06,110
And they liked that because they grew
up in this fucked up society where,

2051
02:03:06,111 --> 02:03:06,291
you know,

2052
02:03:06,291 --> 02:03:09,500
in the fifties and sixties or whatever
the fuck time they were developing,

2053
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:13,330
there was no information. Everybody was
horse shit. Everybody was, you know, you,

2054
02:03:13,331 --> 02:03:17,030
you, you act like information
is something that people want.

2055
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:19,490
We are in a five that
you wanted it or not.

2056
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,080
There's enough people that want it
that are moving things. Yeah, no,

2057
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:25,610
but were we live in a very insular,
we think,

2058
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:28,670
oh you have fucking 3 million listeners,

2059
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:32,270
but they just want to hear
fist fuck jokes. Most of them.

2060
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:37,280
That's one thing like Facebook has made
me realize how many times people laugh

2061
02:03:37,281 --> 02:03:41,240
for the wrong reasons because they comment
about it and lose all respect for a

2062
02:03:41,241 --> 02:03:44,540
dude when you see a legit lol. Uh, yeah.

2063
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:47,270
But it so easy is respect for someone.
I try not to.

2064
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:50,590
So I try to be open minded about, I was
talking about earlier though, I do LLS,

2065
02:03:50,650 --> 02:03:55,510
I do happy faces. I just don't care.
Like, I think it's funny as a joke.

2066
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:58,060
Yeah. Well you, when you do lol to me,

2067
02:03:58,061 --> 02:04:01,390
I actually do think it's funny
because I know it's not a real lol.

2068
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:03,890
It's like you're making fun of
the fact that you're saying lol.

2069
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:08,400
You're going to just silly joke this
three times gone, right? Yeah. Hey it

2070
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:13,260
calm day that you are around four and hey,
let me be the wacky neighbor.

2071
02:04:13,261 --> 02:04:17,520
That's what your friends would say and
then then they said it too much and

2072
02:04:17,521 --> 02:04:19,200
you're like, all right,
that's such a cliche.

2073
02:04:19,201 --> 02:04:23,440
Let me be your wacky neighbor that now
it's a cliche of when it wasn't cliches.

2074
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:28,210
Oh, it's funny. Again, maybe your
wacky neighbor on your podcast,

2075
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:33,630
so that's true. Yeah.
Yeah. Like refried beans,

2076
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:38,070
lol, lol, stop. Why do
I have to my God damn

2077
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,650
ugly head everywhere I look,
it's just what it looks like.

2078
02:04:40,990 --> 02:04:43,860
You got to just look at me. Focus
on the magic. He looked very good.

2079
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:46,710
You look very healthy.
Keep going into Diniro though.

2080
02:04:47,050 --> 02:04:50,190
You actually look really
healthy this time. You look
really, you look really good.

2081
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:54,390
It's out in the sun. My house was on the
fucking women's group is be home tour.

2082
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:58,840
So I had to be out the women's group.
Busy home tour. What does that actually,

2083
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:03,490
I think it was like nick soon.
I had to leave him.

2084
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:06,210
I'm sorry I can't call you back right now,
but

2085
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:12,470
I haven't. I called someone
with an excuse where I go, I,

2086
02:05:12,471 --> 02:05:16,950
I'm ashamed to admit it has something
to do with the whip Bisbee women's club.

2087
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:21,210
Oh that's hilarious. So they would do
it like a tour of the homes in the area.

2088
02:05:21,211 --> 02:05:25,590
They won't do it every year they do a
Bisbee home tour cause there's a lot of

2089
02:05:25,591 --> 02:05:27,780
weird houses there.
So we,

2090
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:32,680
after 29 years in a town of
6,000 they were out of ideas.

2091
02:05:32,681 --> 02:05:37,650
So they came to us because we paint
our rocks. Weird Duck. What do you do?

2092
02:05:37,651 --> 02:05:40,840
You paint your rocks weird. You, I'll
try it again. All right here. Jack,

2093
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:45,330
have you done anything lately?
Five, five 40 pranks. You know what,

2094
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:49,830
it was the awesome, but Austin was
just fucking wore off on me. Dude.

2095
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:51,360
I got affected by Brian.

2096
02:05:51,361 --> 02:05:56,130
Red Band was when you would do those a
pedophile baiting's did you put those out

2097
02:05:56,131 --> 02:05:57,930
in a book? Yeah, I put him out in a book,

2098
02:05:57,931 --> 02:06:01,110
but the title of the book
is a fun with pedophiles,

2099
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:05,070
which I had never even
considered because you know,

2100
02:06:05,071 --> 02:06:09,390
I'm the fucking last guy to know.
Even thinking about technology.

2101
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:13,980
Sorry, just this is another
reason I don't smoke, but

2102
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:18,930
yeah, that's why you have
a cigarette in your hand.

2103
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:25,350
I never thought that people wouldn't
want to punch pedophiles into a search

2104
02:06:25,351 --> 02:06:29,160
engine. I don't know what a search
engine, you don't want that.

2105
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:33,150
And that's the name of the book I get.
Can you rerelease it was another hood.

2106
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:37,950
Just call it beating is. Yeah. The best
debating is the subtitle. Oh, okay.

2107
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:42,750
Yeah. But Fun with pedophiles. That
is a problem. Yeah, this is fucking,

2108
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:45,460
you gotta be real careful about that
these days. That probably brings up some,

2109
02:06:45,461 --> 02:06:50,070
there's like some crazy search
engine database with the FBI, right?

2110
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:54,610
Yeah. Fun with pedophiles.
I love the cover.

2111
02:06:54,611 --> 02:06:56,700
It's so nice.
Ballsy.

2112
02:06:57,330 --> 02:07:01,980
And if the best positive
reviews to look at that. Yeah.

2113
02:07:01,981 --> 02:07:04,860
So folks go get that book
because it is fucking hilarious.

2114
02:07:04,861 --> 02:07:06,010
Cause I remember when a lot of title,

2115
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:10,620
the only stuff I've ever done that I go
back and I laugh my balls off at my own

2116
02:07:10,621 --> 02:07:14,910
stuff. It was really good comedy. I
hate it. I can't listen to an old album,

2117
02:07:14,911 --> 02:07:17,010
a new album. Fun what? Pedophiles.

2118
02:07:17,011 --> 02:07:21,450
I read and I fucking laugh like someone
else wrote it. Well that was uh, those,

2119
02:07:21,451 --> 02:07:24,410
those baiting days. Is
that still up? What, what,

2120
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:28,470
what it means it's archived active,

2121
02:07:28,471 --> 02:07:32,580
but you can read all their shit. So good
stuff. So much good stuff. Wicked funny.

2122
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:35,190
There's a guy that
called don't even reply.

2123
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:37,990
Com that fucks with craigslist people.

2124
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:41,110
But he only updates it like
every fucking three months.

2125
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:43,510
You come back from Europe and you're like,
Oh,

2126
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:48,070
don't even reply the have because he's
so good. It's wicked funny. Wow. So get,

2127
02:07:48,071 --> 02:07:50,740
yeah, go. You guys are bored. Go to,

2128
02:07:50,741 --> 02:07:55,650
don't even reply.com and say do some more
shit is out of Philly, I think. Yeah.

2129
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:58,870
Do you, uh, do you remember when
the Jerky boys weren't famous?

2130
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:01,560
Remember when it was like a tape
that would go round tapes like a,

2131
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:06,450
they're making a documentary out of a,
what do you shut up? Little Man. Yeah.

2132
02:08:06,451 --> 02:08:09,160
Yeah. Red Red Bar. Is that
what it is? The Red Bar was,

2133
02:08:09,161 --> 02:08:12,220
that's what most is lack is
based on in the Simpsons.

2134
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:15,150
The toolbar to the right,
right.

2135
02:08:15,570 --> 02:08:18,760
They based most is lack
on the two bar tapes.

2136
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,360
Alcoholic.
That was the famous two bar.

2137
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:27,810
Does this out alcoholic and then
he finally catch on and he'd go,

2138
02:08:28,031 --> 02:08:31,390
Yep, mother, fuck ICAK Sockeye
fucking, I'll carry out.

2139
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:36,130
Find your mother fucking,
yeah, the two bar tapes. Yeah.

2140
02:08:36,131 --> 02:08:38,230
That guy was hilarious. That's
what I was thinking. Oh,

2141
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:41,350
Winnebago man is a documentary
based on those days,

2142
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:45,420
which is fantastic when a big old man
is based on this guy who was a Winnebago

2143
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:46,470
salesman who would just,

2144
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:50,680
he would do these videos where he was
doing a commercial and then in he would

2145
02:08:50,681 --> 02:08:53,890
fuck up the take and they played
all the outtakes. When you fuck up,

2146
02:08:53,891 --> 02:08:58,030
we'd start squaring you motherfucker. You
mother was con. It would just get crazy.

2147
02:08:58,830 --> 02:09:02,380
Awesome. But yeah, the feel good story.

2148
02:09:02,381 --> 02:09:07,120
At the end like you don't expect it to
go well and it was actually a documentary

2149
02:09:07,121 --> 02:09:11,350
where at the end you're like, ah, I
fucking feel really good about myself.

2150
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:18,700
It was because the guy was like, he was
fucking a horrible functional. Okay,

2151
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:20,840
sure. On privacy. I don't even,
what the fuck I'm reading.

2152
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:25,580
I'll know what the fuck the real
dialogue is. What the fuck is this thing?

2153
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:29,040
All of the windshield.
Perfect fuck sake. Oh fuck.

2154
02:09:29,690 --> 02:09:32,630
What the fuck did I say that
in Psalm for shit did it.

2155
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:34,490
Trying to give these guys
everything they can get to me.

2156
02:09:34,491 --> 02:09:37,190
Not sounds like a perfectionist.
No. What the fuck I'm saying?

2157
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:39,160
Let's just get mad at himself.

2158
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:40,980
We suppose we opened

2159
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:45,490
gotta do it again right now.

2160
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:52,690
I feel like those guys that were, ah,
we knew this one. They were garage band.

2161
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:54,710
Oh fuck.

2162
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:57,380
Let's, he's just trying to do a good
time when he keeps fucking it up.

2163
02:09:57,940 --> 02:10:02,740
Donnie, do me a favor. Will you please?
Will you do me a kindness? Yeah.

2164
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,620
I think I don't want
you walking in and out.

2165
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:10,360
I don't dare make any difference to me
at this juncture. Thank you very much.

2166
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:13,510
Appreciate that Tony.
Don't slam the fucking door

2167
02:10:15,810 --> 02:10:16,820
no more.

2168
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:19,673
Okay.

2169
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:24,800
You remember that video is because of
this video that went around back in the

2170
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:29,690
day when people just passed
off tapes. Yeah. Big giant VHS.

2171
02:10:29,691 --> 02:10:34,340
Dave, you gotta check this out. I remember
those very world pooping on a deed.

2172
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:36,950
Yeah, I would a, I had
a friend from Austin,

2173
02:10:36,951 --> 02:10:39,830
he used to give me these fucking
mix tapes that he would make you.

2174
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:43,610
I just got rid of him recently cause I
had already seen the images a hundred

2175
02:10:43,611 --> 02:10:47,330
times but his videos would be all the
weirdest shit that he ever found and he

2176
02:10:47,331 --> 02:10:50,150
would splice them together. It was
like an art form for him. Yeah.

2177
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:51,330
Used to do that all the time.

2178
02:10:51,331 --> 02:10:54,420
I [inaudible] if you Google
search or Red Band Java lamps,

2179
02:10:54,510 --> 02:10:57,810
I have a few of them like that where
I just put like it was right when the

2180
02:10:57,811 --> 02:11:00,400
Internet video is becoming big.
Like the crazy shit.

2181
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:03,510
Like you know a woman found inside
of an alligator, you know, type shit.

2182
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:06,960
And it was like just spliced and I
put it with her like trippy music.

2183
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:11,300
Wow. That's in a while. That used to
be the Internet was just like, Oh,

2184
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:14,620
a human internet. Like you'd have
to hand someone the videotape.

2185
02:11:15,010 --> 02:11:16,030
Like that's how it goes.
I mean,

2186
02:11:16,031 --> 02:11:21,031
he could transfer that in that idea as
a virus or as an organism could transfer

2187
02:11:21,041 --> 02:11:24,700
all over the place from person to
person and even be like duplicated.

2188
02:11:24,701 --> 02:11:27,460
Even though it gets really fucking
grainy when it gets like third and fourth

2189
02:11:27,461 --> 02:11:31,480
generation. But that's what you had to do.
That's how you got things out, you know?

2190
02:11:31,481 --> 02:11:33,430
And you, you, you saw
Barnyard Betty, right?

2191
02:11:33,460 --> 02:11:36,970
Did you ever see barnyard bending
when you were a kid? No. No. Really?

2192
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:40,660
I might've seen it, but I don't
know. It wasn't titled Wild Optin.

2193
02:11:40,661 --> 02:11:43,780
Rowdy was the guy that
turned me as a young comic.

2194
02:11:43,781 --> 02:11:47,380
There's a guy named captain rowdy,
I remember that guy's name. Yeah.

2195
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:52,260
He was a anywhere like leather jackets
and shit, leather chaps and Mohawk.

2196
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:55,270
And there's a lot of dudes like that.
It had like a fucking whole thing.

2197
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:59,530
But they had,
he had a huge following in the south west,

2198
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:04,800
not including California,
uh, but lovely. Lubbock,

2199
02:12:04,801 --> 02:12:09,070
Lubbock, Texas, and take me on
the road. And he was, he like,

2200
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:13,390
he's a, he's still, if he's,
he would be in my death pool.

2201
02:12:13,391 --> 02:12:16,690
If he had a Wikipedia page. It doesn't
have to look at peanut butter days.

2202
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:21,250
He's going to die. He like calls me
every couple months. Like he's fucked.

2203
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:22,300
It's a long story.

2204
02:12:22,450 --> 02:12:26,740
I want to do a documentary about all the
80s comics and thought they had it made.

2205
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:32,500
We were making five grand a week. You
didn't even have to have jokes. And they,

2206
02:12:32,501 --> 02:12:34,780
but they banked their light and you've,
you know,

2207
02:12:34,781 --> 02:12:37,380
some of the relics of that and do the,

2208
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:41,530
do you ever see the documentary
beyond the mat, beyond the mat?

2209
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:45,940
What does it say about wrestling and it
has it like Jake the snake Roberts and

2210
02:12:45,941 --> 02:12:50,920
he's all fucking plan and some armory
in Carney Nebraska and smoking crack and

2211
02:12:50,921 --> 02:12:53,580
Whoa. And then old guys that
are still trying to do it,

2212
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:57,640
their knees are falling apart like fucking
but there's still in it and then guys

2213
02:12:57,641 --> 02:13:00,250
trying out for it,
they get it.

2214
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:04,740
So it's a whole balance of this whole
wrestling seem like new guy, old guy.

2215
02:13:04,741 --> 02:13:09,730
And I've had folks, I would love to do
a documentary like that about comedy.

2216
02:13:10,030 --> 02:13:14,010
The guys that thought
they fucking had a ride.

2217
02:13:14,230 --> 02:13:19,030
If there's a bunch of guys that Vic
Dunlop was like a guy that I like when I

2218
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:20,320
thought of this idea,

2219
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:25,390
captain rowdy is such a
fucking magnificent story.
Do you think those guys,

2220
02:13:25,391 --> 02:13:27,010
I mean some of them are
still working right,

2221
02:13:27,070 --> 02:13:31,680
so they're just out there just so there's
guys that made it to the guys to get a

2222
02:13:31,681 --> 02:13:32,370
perspective

2223
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:37,370
of the guy that is fucking dying and lost
his legs to diabetes and just did coke

2224
02:13:37,591 --> 02:13:42,150
down of lawyers playing fucking
Biloxi, Mississippi, Mr Saturday night.

2225
02:13:42,151 --> 02:13:43,680
You know those guys. Right, right, right.

2226
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:48,020
That it would just be a beautiful
fucking documentary to watch. Oh,

2227
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,930
could be interesting.

2228
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:52,980
They're just guys just wrote it to the
wheels fell off and there's guys that are

2229
02:13:52,981 --> 02:13:57,490
still doing triple gigs in their sixties
but they're happy with it. There's some,

2230
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:01,380
some are happening. Yeah. Yeah.
When I was living in Boston,

2231
02:14:01,381 --> 02:14:05,550
there was a lot of guys won't accept
when people are happy with things that

2232
02:14:05,551 --> 02:14:09,780
they've built some kind
of fake value system on.

2233
02:14:10,190 --> 02:14:14,070
If you don't, well you're not
there so you can't be happy. No,

2234
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:18,510
I'm actually fucking wicked happy
living in a small town with, yeah. Yeah.

2235
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:22,590
I didn't move there to
fucking make it big stupid.

2236
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:28,100
Doug, do you remember the point
when we first met? Uh, I came,

2237
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:32,630
I forgot Brian's here and I like talking.
I came to Ohio University and I,

2238
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:35,940
it was like I recorded you and it,
was that still on Youtube? Yeah,

2239
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:39,650
it was a walked like 600 people.
They fucking,

2240
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:43,610
they billed me as I,
I still and I,

2241
02:14:43,611 --> 02:14:48,490
it was that tour if not that night as the
last time I can remember doing a shows

2242
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:53,500
sober and I remember like Ed Helms was
on the fucking bill and Flan again.

2243
02:14:54,231 --> 02:14:55,730
Finnegan yet again fitting in.
Yeah.

2244
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:58,960
Oh somehow I fucking those the
last time you did a show sober

2245
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:04,550
last I can remember it was,
it was parents like doing shows sober.

2246
02:15:04,551 --> 02:15:07,490
I'm not by myself amusing
and fucking sober.

2247
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:09,430
It was parents of the
future weekend though.

2248
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:13,970
They billed it as like a family friendly
show and but it was parents weekend

2249
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:14,600
this weekend.

2250
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:19,600
Family friendly is listed in the program
and there's not a lot of fucking on

2251
02:15:20,001 --> 02:15:23,240
campus options for entertainment.
It's not a town.

2252
02:15:23,450 --> 02:15:27,770
He said fucking campus what your parents
and under fucking fun for all the

2253
02:15:27,771 --> 02:15:32,150
family is the comedy central
presents to her with Doug Larkin.

2254
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:37,390
Everyone else that they find it fine
and then I like your kid's going to get

2255
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:38,743
fucked here.

2256
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:43,010
Like people in the video that like
people were like yelling like you get off

2257
02:15:43,011 --> 02:15:45,900
stage, you know? I mean
this is high this year.

2258
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:51,660
Like some angry dad right
beside where he's filming. Yeah.

2259
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:55,640
Are you finding this? I know it's on
you. You were watching it right now here.

2260
02:15:55,641 --> 02:16:00,250
Right here.
This is a whole set.

2261
02:16:00,510 --> 02:16:00,700
No,

2262
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:04,270
it's just pieces of your set and then
it goes to the part where the guy starts

2263
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:05,970
yelling. People are like, Dario,

2264
02:16:12,030 --> 02:16:16,050
this audio is way too bad.
Then the guy starts screaming at that.

2265
02:16:16,051 --> 02:16:16,884
You could hear that.

2266
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:23,713
Yup.

2267
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,470
He's talking about buff fucking read.

2268
02:16:26,471 --> 02:16:29,670
Doris would never have these
kinds of delays. Just say

2269
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:30,833
yeah he wouldn't,

2270
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:35,980
but that's the charm part of the charm
is the fact that this fucking glitches in

2271
02:16:35,981 --> 02:16:37,540
the matrix.
Here it comes right here

2272
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:47,010
are you barely can understand what
you're saying. Unfortunately. I know.

2273
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,980
I wish he could if he
get queued up to though.

2274
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:51,353
Here we go.

2275
02:16:57,590 --> 02:17:01,470
He's full of shit and anyone crazy enough
to listen to that mother fuckers who

2276
02:17:01,471 --> 02:17:03,280
is he's,
that's what he's,

2277
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:09,750
but the whole time there's just people
standing up and just like filing out

2278
02:17:09,751 --> 02:17:10,920
because this was like the first,

2279
02:17:10,921 --> 02:17:13,530
I think if this was like the first
weekend with like all the new students,

2280
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:17,370
you know, were they, there was a
third of the crowded a theater. Yeah.

2281
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:21,820
It was so weird. Wow. That's an
uncomfortable feeling. Oh yeah.

2282
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:26,090
People always get angry and I,
there's this uncomfortable feelings like,

2283
02:17:26,091 --> 02:17:31,091
do you do like we did those fucking music
festivals knowing I was going to get

2284
02:17:31,181 --> 02:17:34,990
fucking trashed and music
festivals leads and reading.

2285
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:39,450
When did you do this? This is the
reason. It's like two, three years ago.

2286
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:42,310
What happened? It's just that
there's no way I'm going to fight.

2287
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:45,520
These are people that bought
tickets for three days.

2288
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:48,160
They didn't buy tickets to you or comedy.

2289
02:17:48,550 --> 02:17:53,520
Is it tense and I'm not, I'm
not a guy that's, I'm not
fucking Hedberg where I go.

2290
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:58,690
There's another joke.
I have a guy that I'm like this,

2291
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:03,960
I'm a fucking two hour podcast of me
stuttering and looking for a cigarette and

2292
02:18:04,751 --> 02:18:08,110
then yelling about something when it
strikes me it's not going to work at a

2293
02:18:08,111 --> 02:18:08,980
music festival.

2294
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:13,420
They were fucking just audibly booing
me just cause I'm boring to them.

2295
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:16,400
Well you've still got your own
crowd now. I know, but it's,

2296
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:19,930
they know what you're doing and they
want to see it and a person who doesn't

2297
02:18:19,931 --> 02:18:24,931
know you want to try to get them in
there like you're not designed to work.

2298
02:18:26,060 --> 02:18:29,500
Like when you're coming up your act
as sort of designed to work on as many

2299
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:32,170
people as possible.
You try to sort of maximize it.

2300
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:35,050
I wouldn't now I now I'm defining them.

2301
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:39,070
Actually I'm turning down fans at this
point. But then yeah, a waiting list.

2302
02:18:39,071 --> 02:18:40,840
It's like a lambo field.

2303
02:18:42,930 --> 02:18:46,240
I can only have this many fans.
Sorry. Stand on the porch.

2304
02:18:46,241 --> 02:18:47,840
Like fight club for three days.

2305
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:52,480
You must get a lot of weird
motherfucker said come visit you.

2306
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:58,450
You're so Denise throwing all the fucking
time. I don't know what's going on.

2307
02:18:58,451 --> 02:19:01,330
I'm still fucking high as shit.
And indeed,

2308
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:05,370
when I first moved to La, Doug was the
first person that like I was friends with.

2309
02:19:05,371 --> 02:19:08,040
I think, uh, like it like,
well you obviously Joe,

2310
02:19:08,041 --> 02:19:11,220
but like d like Doug would like call me
up and just be like, hey man, I'm bored.

2311
02:19:11,470 --> 02:19:13,350
You want to go make some shit about you?

2312
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:17,220
You only sell only this stuff you can
say behind your back because you're very

2313
02:19:17,221 --> 02:19:21,600
angry and it talks shit. No, no,

2314
02:19:21,601 --> 02:19:24,390
I'm saying it was always fun to
talk shit behind Joe's back. Oh,

2315
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,010
well we made it used to
make these, so I'm saying, I

2316
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,440
probably talked a lot of shit
about Joe to you. Oh, okay.

2317
02:19:31,660 --> 02:19:36,660
Well we used to make these videos because
he got mad at Verizon Dsl because he

2318
02:19:37,361 --> 02:19:41,060
had DSL at the time. And so we were
like, hey, let's go to the thrift stores.

2319
02:19:41,061 --> 02:19:43,900
He would go to the thrift store
and we buy like terrorists outfits.

2320
02:19:44,170 --> 02:19:48,320
And then we've made these, we made these
videos, he made these videos and I said,

2321
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:49,980
Marlin, I'm to all the, the,

2322
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:54,790
the Verizon corporate office number
after that guy had been beheaded.

2323
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:58,630
So it will be like, I was even afraid to
put these up. Like I remember being like,

2324
02:19:58,631 --> 02:20:02,470
all right, you could get too much
shit, dude. This is dangerous.

2325
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:05,880
You've got Aaron writing. What
does that writing? Yeah, no,

2326
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:09,430
after everyone was like,
oh, he's not really Arabic.

2327
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:10,453
Right?

2328
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:22,970
You told me my service would
be taught and it's been a week.

2329
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:25,300
And by the way,
that's Doug on both sides.

2330
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:35,960
That was through a store,

2331
02:20:35,961 --> 02:20:40,961
a Muslim baby backward before the
Muslims ward tags off their burgers.

2332
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:51,750
Hey, why don't we just play the fucking
man show? Hit him in the head with a pen.

2333
02:20:51,751 --> 02:20:55,340
Go ahead. Right. The second day
is, let's not, let's, let's stop.

2334
02:20:55,350 --> 02:20:59,000
Let's stop right here. But yeah,
I just stopped the whole podcast.

2335
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:00,210
I think we've done enough.

2336
02:21:00,830 --> 02:21:02,450
This podcast has been like fucking,

2337
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:06,800
what has it been like two and a half hours
long. Two hours. 20 minutes. Oh Shit.

2338
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:09,500
So at some point you're right.

2339
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:13,880
At some point we're right. Well,
the first 20 minutes, I'm like,

2340
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:16,280
we've been here for
like four hours. No, no.

2341
02:21:16,281 --> 02:21:19,240
It's only six o'clock we're still
good. We're still rolling now. Yeah,

2342
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:22,700
that they'll have cocktails since
you're good. Do you want to keep going?

2343
02:21:22,701 --> 02:21:25,700
Good for the show. I want to keep
going. Another like 1520 minutes. Oh,

2344
02:21:25,701 --> 02:21:30,270
I'll fucking talk. As long as people
were putting in work on the fucking John,

2345
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:33,580
I want to dig another 20 minutes
and then call it a night. Yeah.

2346
02:21:34,430 --> 02:21:39,320
People aren't getting, you can turn it
off at whatever point. Yes. That's a good,

2347
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:40,400
good piece of advice.

2348
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:43,140
You don't want to see me get hit in
the head with a fucking good dude.

2349
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:44,800
It goes long.

2350
02:21:45,890 --> 02:21:49,920
It's not like the fucking Bray at Improv
where they're paying for parking or

2351
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:54,950
listening to a podcast. You're taking a
shit right now. It goes a little too long.

2352
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:59,300
If it goes too long,
just make it fucking three parts.

2353
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:02,740
You're the director asshole.
One minute longer.

2354
02:22:02,750 --> 02:22:05,990
Three part by hitting new
is one minute long. Yeah.

2355
02:22:07,830 --> 02:22:12,260
You quit the cigarettes for a little
bit, right? Yeah. For a year. Got Fat,

2356
02:22:12,290 --> 02:22:14,240
started smoking again,
stayed fat.

2357
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:18,380
Now I cough while I'm fat.

2358
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:22,750
So you did it as sort of a dietary
measure to just no, no. I just,

2359
02:22:22,751 --> 02:22:25,590
I quit for a year,
like 2008

2360
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,170
and then went to Costa Rica

2361
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:29,670
and uh,

2362
02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:32,880
buck 25 pack at the bar

2363
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,010
and you can smoke everywhere. You
can smoke at bars. You just figured,

2364
02:22:38,011 --> 02:22:40,710
fuck it just for this vacation ain't
going. I, yeah, we'll, we'll just,

2365
02:22:40,711 --> 02:22:43,020
just for this week and yeah.

2366
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:45,780
So I've been trying to quit since 2008.

2367
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:49,280
Oh Wow.
That sucks.

2368
02:22:50,180 --> 02:22:53,000
That must feel weird, man. That's
gotta be a very weird thing,

2369
02:22:53,001 --> 02:22:56,840
like connected to something, you know,
and it's not easy to escape. Right.

2370
02:22:57,140 --> 02:23:00,170
The worst part is every time he smokes,
I want to light one up immediately.

2371
02:23:00,171 --> 02:23:03,530
Like I'm like, can I just see
it? And I'm like, all right,
I got it. Like I told you,

2372
02:23:03,531 --> 02:23:06,200
I quit coffee recently,
but it's only been like eight days.

2373
02:23:06,201 --> 02:23:07,460
I can't even say I quit coffee.

2374
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:09,950
I'm just seeing when it's likely it's
not drink coffee for a long time.

2375
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:11,630
The third time this has happened,

2376
02:23:12,740 --> 02:23:17,600
but when you said fried clams
in a conversation before, right.

2377
02:23:17,930 --> 02:23:22,930
I just fixated on fried clams and I
made my face make the motions like I'm

2378
02:23:23,271 --> 02:23:23,751
listening,

2379
02:23:23,751 --> 02:23:27,770
but I was thinking and then you said
something about fucking Burrito's you're

2380
02:23:27,771 --> 02:23:32,060
hungry. No, it is just as the
third time when you say coffee,

2381
02:23:32,061 --> 02:23:36,620
am I fucking Bailey's coffee? And then
I'm looking around and I distract myself.

2382
02:23:36,890 --> 02:23:41,030
So what you're saying is I got a good
voice for advertising just every now and

2383
02:23:41,031 --> 02:23:42,610
then.
You mentioned a fucking thing.

2384
02:23:43,070 --> 02:23:45,680
I'm just saying when I look
like I'm being fake, I am.

2385
02:23:46,940 --> 02:23:48,500
Because you're thinking about whatever

2386
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,530
you're like, why is Robert Deniro
saying I should have a Bailey's coffee?

2387
02:23:53,740 --> 02:23:57,270
Oh, Douglas. Why do you think
it? I never think Robert Deniro,

2388
02:23:58,110 --> 02:23:58,760
Robert to me,

2389
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:03,520
I think more of a heel Julio fallacious
guy or whatever that guys love people.

2390
02:24:03,770 --> 02:24:04,970
Again,
I have like,

2391
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:09,350
I have a fucking high
i's where this is like

2392
02:24:09,530 --> 02:24:12,480
came on home.
I dedicate this song.

2393
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:17,300
You need a mall.

2394
02:24:17,301 --> 02:24:21,860
One point I thought I was getting my
elbow in the pool because the ashtray is

2395
02:24:21,861 --> 02:24:23,420
right here and at one point I'm like,

2396
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:27,200
and I pulled away like I was going to
get all those cigarettes during the time

2397
02:24:27,201 --> 02:24:29,250
we do this podcast. I'm going
to like, yeah, that's it.

2398
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:31,110
Like 10 gave me a whole pack.

2399
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:35,830
Seven, eight, nine, nine
cigarettes. You're crazy. Smells.

2400
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:39,530
It seems like so many. You got that chain
smoker. David tells two packs again.

2401
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:43,920
David tells worse times to, yeah. He
goes to the doctor so he knows he's,

2402
02:24:44,150 --> 02:24:48,350
he has emphysema. Like I, I don't
know nothing. I don't know anything.

2403
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:51,810
How many swung into the
day? Uh, not, not as many

2404
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:54,730
a pack. Yeah. Pack now probably. Yeah.

2405
02:24:56,250 --> 02:25:00,720
There's nothing that replaces that.
Huh? You ever try cigars? I could quit.

2406
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:03,000
I just fucking Nafta take time.

2407
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:06,090
Quit before cigars would
make you a classic douchebag.

2408
02:25:07,010 --> 02:25:10,390
I was last year. Ron White, like
Ron White has this exhibit. Yeah.

2409
02:25:10,490 --> 02:25:14,020
He has this whole fucking,
a whole circular exemption from Ev.

2410
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:17,180
Everything completely agree.
Every picture he has it,

2411
02:25:18,110 --> 02:25:21,050
he's under a cloud of that.
That you don't know why.

2412
02:25:21,051 --> 02:25:23,470
Ralphie may gut the amnesty but white

2413
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:28,550
and he has this whole, Ralphie
May's a lovable guy, right? Yeah.

2414
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:32,550
But Ron White on white barn,
the whole yup.

2415
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:37,190
100% I did I tell you about what
he's buying jokes from. You know,

2416
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:41,020
he has a lot of writers and uh,
Andy,

2417
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:45,310
he has bought a couple of Andy
Andrews a bit silly and I,

2418
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:47,270
when I saw him in Austin,
I go, yeah, you buy him.

2419
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:52,060
Like my buddy's got a couple of his
bits in it and he said without any shame

2420
02:25:52,061 --> 02:25:54,250
whatsoever. Ron White says, yeah,

2421
02:25:54,251 --> 02:25:58,510
we buy a lot of really funny
bits from really funny comics.

2422
02:25:58,511 --> 02:25:59,840
And then what we do is take,

2423
02:26:00,490 --> 02:26:03,940
take the teeth out of them
so they're not funny anymore.

2424
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:06,640
And then my audience applauds

2425
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:15,060
fucking biomaterial I'm fucking selling
fucking snake oil to fucking sucker is

2426
02:26:16,030 --> 02:26:20,380
cause I know this ain't going to last.
So what does he waters is act down?

2427
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:22,300
Is that what he's doing?
And he's just backing off.

2428
02:26:22,490 --> 02:26:26,920
He plays to that audience and he,
he's fuck heel toe,

2429
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:31,240
his fucking Rolls Royce off the back
of his tour bus. He's like, he's like,

2430
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:36,300
he's like a vanilla ice in like jokingly,

2431
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:42,250
like he's like flashing all this
because he knows it's pointless.

2432
02:26:43,610 --> 02:26:48,130
But allies like flashy, like you'll
like drives rolls Royces rappers like,

2433
02:26:48,131 --> 02:26:51,910
I'm sorry this is the second time and
fucking three days where I tried to find a

2434
02:26:51,911 --> 02:26:56,560
fucking rapper preference
preference and [inaudible] ll cool.

2435
02:26:56,561 --> 02:27:01,320
Just go with Birdman. I said no, he's
love of automobiles and he's very quiet.

2436
02:27:01,610 --> 02:27:06,090
Birdman. Birdman. Okay. Some
rat you fucking listen to.

2437
02:27:06,150 --> 02:27:08,020
I don't fucking garbage.

2438
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:11,710
Well when I was listening to is why
reality TV works cause everyone wants to

2439
02:27:11,711 --> 02:27:14,920
think they could do it too. And that's
why I rap music works because yeah,

2440
02:27:14,921 --> 02:27:16,920
you could do it too.
I like some rappers.

2441
02:27:16,921 --> 02:27:21,320
Well I like Nas to know nausea's
no really like that guy.

2442
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:25,670
I know he was a small,
I think it was in a play off of like one.

2443
02:27:26,020 --> 02:27:30,430
I can listen to notorious Bij all
day. I love that old, that old shit.

2444
02:27:31,300 --> 02:27:35,260
I love his, his rap style. I think
there's, it's rhythmic. It's fun.

2445
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:40,390
It's fun for me. But you don't
like to use it. It's I understand.

2446
02:27:40,450 --> 02:27:42,070
I understand,
but you don't like music.

2447
02:27:42,071 --> 02:27:45,370
But I can look at fucking
Zeplin on the wall and go.

2448
02:27:45,371 --> 02:27:48,220
I'm fascinated that someone
could learn to do that.

2449
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:51,910
Not someone sat on a
fucking bus with a notebook.

2450
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:56,280
I don't know about their fucking shit.
I would take this for almost everybody.

2451
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:59,590
Seven notorious B I.
G he didn't just make Shit Ryan.

2452
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:04,540
He made Shit Ryan with
flow and a rhythm to it.

2453
02:28:04,541 --> 02:28:08,710
That was fun. It'd be like it was, it was
fun to listen to. I'll never, you know,

2454
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:09,551
that guy was an artist.

2455
02:28:09,551 --> 02:28:12,230
He was a fucking artist and what he
did was very difficult to do. It's,

2456
02:28:12,231 --> 02:28:15,910
it's very difficult to duplicate. There's
a bunch of guys that are a rap artists.

2457
02:28:15,911 --> 02:28:19,810
Listen, I am like Cypress Hill
reaching from the most uneducated.

2458
02:28:20,050 --> 02:28:22,400
I'm just saying things with confidence.

2459
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:25,790
I know nothing about
music doesn't interest me.

2460
02:28:25,791 --> 02:28:30,050
I'm like the last guy and that's why I
always say I hate music is because I'm

2461
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:34,490
such a comedy snob that I
know of. Someone said, Oh,

2462
02:28:34,491 --> 02:28:36,680
who do you like Jeff Dunham and peanut?

2463
02:28:37,010 --> 02:28:40,940
And I immediately hate you
because you said that like,

2464
02:28:40,941 --> 02:28:45,860
I have a bias against you and I know that
I'm that much of a pedestrian when it

2465
02:28:45,861 --> 02:28:49,190
comes to music. So if I go, yeah,
I fucking Love The counting crows,

2466
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:54,590
I now I have to fucking,
there's no apology, which is
an apology when you say, Oh,

2467
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:58,880
I'm not even apologizing for
liking matchbox 20 like whatever.

2468
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:01,000
What is the the,
I mean for most people,

2469
02:29:01,001 --> 02:29:03,580
like music is sort of a source of
pleasure. It's like a, you know,

2470
02:29:03,581 --> 02:29:05,440
it's fun to listen to.
It's motivating.

2471
02:29:05,620 --> 02:29:07,400
What is it about it that
you think it's just,

2472
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:09,460
is it interferes with
the noise in your head?

2473
02:29:10,190 --> 02:29:11,880
I always knew,

2474
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:17,260
I found it summed up succinctly in a
book that I will now miss quote and ruin,

2475
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:23,180
but Dow is the fucking guy,
the drunkard guy.

2476
02:29:23,181 --> 02:29:27,530
He was a drunkard in England. Dues.
I always want to say Allister,

2477
02:29:27,531 --> 02:29:31,850
but it's not Allister mcallister fucking,
I can't remember his name.

2478
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:37,150
He summed up how pop music ruined the
pub culture in England because when they

2479
02:29:37,821 --> 02:29:42,530
introduced the Juke box that played over
the conversation that you were there to

2480
02:29:42,531 --> 02:29:43,364
have,

2481
02:29:43,370 --> 02:29:48,350
you go to the fucking bar to talk and
now someone introduced music where either

2482
02:29:48,351 --> 02:29:52,630
you want to listen to the music or you
want to have the conversation but out.

2483
02:29:52,700 --> 02:29:56,390
And that's why I've always hated music.
It's something that I want to enjoy.

2484
02:29:56,630 --> 02:30:01,630
Like if I'm really high and I have 400
songs from my life that I can remember

2485
02:30:03,411 --> 02:30:08,120
that I like, they're on an iPod.
If I need music, I go to it.

2486
02:30:08,121 --> 02:30:12,730
Like people go to comedy
clubs once a year. I hear Ya.

2487
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:20,180
Do you find that, did you use to make
music is something that you just who,

2488
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:24,590
oh I've music, it's just, but
it's a part time thing to me.

2489
02:30:24,591 --> 02:30:28,640
Like most people, comedy's a part
time thing. Do us, that's life.

2490
02:30:28,641 --> 02:30:30,530
Fucking listening and words and

2491
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:34,110
I fucking love music and
I get inspired by it.

2492
02:30:34,111 --> 02:30:36,360
I love what I'm working out
in love listening to it.

2493
02:30:36,361 --> 02:30:39,120
I love listening to what I'm driving.
You know? I love listening to it.

2494
02:30:39,121 --> 02:30:42,120
Sometimes when I'm just thinking how
much hit it encapsulates a mood for me.

2495
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:44,820
I just appreciate the art.
I don't know how to do it.

2496
02:30:44,821 --> 02:30:46,920
I don't know anything about music.
I can't sing.

2497
02:30:46,921 --> 02:30:49,610
I don't know how to play a
fucking single instrument. So my,

2498
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:53,640
my interest of it is like purely
as a, just a fan. Believe me,

2499
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:57,480
I wished I wished my fucking
likes were more normal.

2500
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:01,260
A lot of people want to be fucking
weird and out there. I want to,

2501
02:31:01,261 --> 02:31:03,780
I wish people liked the fucking my,

2502
02:31:03,790 --> 02:31:08,190
I wish I could play three songs on my
iPod without saying someone saying,

2503
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:12,290
what the fuck is this?
That's the theme to welcome back Kotter.

2504
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:15,600
It's on my fucking eye part.
It makes me happy.

2505
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:21,870
I've got some stupid shit on my iPod to,
it's the greatest American hero.

2506
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:26,820
I'm walking it all day.
Wow.

2507
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,880
Imagine trying to put that show on today.
They were like,

2508
02:31:29,881 --> 02:31:32,670
what the fuck is going
on to my next an Afro?

2509
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:34,970
That skinny dude with the Afro
was just beating everybody's ass.

2510
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:40,470
Beat anybody up on that show. Of course
he did. Where did he get his power from?

2511
02:31:40,730 --> 02:31:44,070
Greatest American hero. Where'd he
get his power from? I don't remember.

2512
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,800
Running into walls a lot.
Fucking glory holes

2513
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:53,010
as skinny 80s fucking
blonde guy in tights.

2514
02:31:53,070 --> 02:31:57,780
He was my first celebrity sighting when
I moved to Los Angeles at a glory hole.

2515
02:31:57,870 --> 02:31:59,640
No Starbucks.

2516
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:01,400
Basically the same thing.

2517
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:06,530
I used to sell coke to have drove
Loreal greatest American hero.

2518
02:32:06,531 --> 02:32:09,920
He used to go there and play the greatest
American hero and he was just suck my

2519
02:32:09,921 --> 02:32:10,910
Dick Print April.

2520
02:32:11,620 --> 02:32:14,810
I swear you're not going to believe
who they going to believe the greatest

2521
02:32:14,811 --> 02:32:19,700
American hero. Come on dog. Who
Do you think you'd deal with?

2522
02:32:21,010 --> 02:32:23,120
It's just a fun dude and
you hit another one man.

2523
02:32:23,150 --> 02:32:27,170
You're just a chain smoking motherfucker.
I know in my fucking head this is,

2524
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:31,550
this is a nighttime radio like it's cool.

2525
02:32:31,551 --> 02:32:34,400
It's cool that we can smoke in here.
I mean I don't smoke,

2526
02:32:34,401 --> 02:32:36,590
but I liked the fact that
you can't smoke in here.

2527
02:32:36,591 --> 02:32:39,110
There's not a radio station in the
world where you can actually smoke in a

2528
02:32:39,111 --> 02:32:42,320
studio. That's done, man.
Those are businesses,

2529
02:32:42,321 --> 02:32:44,390
man does not a places of art.

2530
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:48,270
Every time you go to do you have like
friends that do radio like Dale Dudley and

2531
02:32:48,300 --> 02:32:53,210
radio. It's like Arizona
for six and a half years.

2532
02:32:53,570 --> 02:32:55,280
Never done Tucson radio.

2533
02:32:55,281 --> 02:33:00,070
Somehow they like Tucson's
against entertainment. Really?

2534
02:33:00,260 --> 02:33:05,260
Why the shittiest fucking comedy club in
the world that still exists since 1982

2535
02:33:05,271 --> 02:33:08,750
song from you? 90 minutes.
That's where I fly out of,

2536
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:12,260
but it's 90 minutes with
no fucking traffic lights.

2537
02:33:12,260 --> 02:33:16,790
It's just desert and a border check.
Oh Jesus Christ.

2538
02:33:16,791 --> 02:33:20,270
Border Patrol has a 50 mile radius.
How did this fucking town,

2539
02:33:20,271 --> 02:33:23,510
you're like only a couple miles
from Mexico. How'd this town evolve?

2540
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:27,230
Cause it's like a line but
it's sort of an art town.

2541
02:33:27,890 --> 02:33:32,890
The copper mine went bust in the 70s so
all the property values dropped and all

2542
02:33:33,111 --> 02:33:36,860
the fucking hippies swarmed
in. But really? Yeah,

2543
02:33:36,890 --> 02:33:40,610
they occupied Bisbee cause there
was selling property. There's no,

2544
02:33:40,850 --> 02:33:44,630
no work altogether though.
That always freaks me out.

2545
02:33:44,631 --> 02:33:49,100
Like how to gain neighborhoods start.
How did you know, how does everybody say,

2546
02:33:49,101 --> 02:33:52,010
listen, this fucking two of us
were living in this one building.

2547
02:33:52,011 --> 02:33:56,720
The building next door has got, yeah,
same way. Burning man started, right?

2548
02:33:57,090 --> 02:34:01,340
Yeah. Hey, this is cool. You stopped
doing your yearly thing to yeah,

2549
02:34:01,341 --> 02:34:04,340
because too many people showed up.
I didn't know the whole point of art.

2550
02:34:04,370 --> 02:34:07,610
We had a fucking death valley
party that we do every year.

2551
02:34:07,910 --> 02:34:12,200
Just like all the people you meet on the
road every year in Atlanta and you know,

2552
02:34:12,201 --> 02:34:14,890
two people there, they're
fucking great, but you're on the,

2553
02:34:14,930 --> 02:34:18,040
they're not your friends cause right.
So the whole idea

2554
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,910
was to bring all those people into
death valley with no fucking cell phone

2555
02:34:21,911 --> 02:34:26,800
reception or TVs and it
was as little motel. Uh,

2556
02:34:26,820 --> 02:34:31,720
and we did that for till I get
to a point where seven years in,

2557
02:34:32,150 --> 02:34:37,060
well, the people that brought people last
time brought people and these people,

2558
02:34:37,090 --> 02:34:39,580
so none of your friends are
there and all their friends.

2559
02:34:39,730 --> 02:34:42,250
So it's like after a show
and you're just like shaking,

2560
02:34:42,251 --> 02:34:47,140
it could be cops and the cops
were around. Yeah, there. Yeah.

2561
02:34:47,290 --> 02:34:51,910
The house would tilt us to when
there was some plain clothes. Yeah.

2562
02:34:51,911 --> 02:34:54,040
I would imagine that that you and your,

2563
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:58,060
your crowd would be a perfect dark valley.
Seven cops in death valley.

2564
02:34:58,061 --> 02:35:02,170
So the one guy comes in a polo shirt
and they're like, he's a cop. The only,

2565
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:06,590
we're the only ones that don't know
where tourists. That's hilarious. Yeah.

2566
02:35:06,830 --> 02:35:08,030
Polo shirt.
Sir.

2567
02:35:08,031 --> 02:35:11,750
Can I w I permission to wear a shirt
with no collar to permission denied.

2568
02:35:13,230 --> 02:35:16,520
You don't have to you.
You're a bad undercover officer.

2569
02:35:16,670 --> 02:35:21,140
If you needed a t shirt to convince
a fucking perp, come on boy.

2570
02:35:21,650 --> 02:35:24,590
Get out there.
Put them in pink underwear.

2571
02:35:26,810 --> 02:35:29,990
There's your boy, right sheriff,
our pile. He's the guy in Arizona.

2572
02:35:30,180 --> 02:35:34,510
He's amazing. He's on my list. Yeah. Nice.

2573
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:38,730
I haven't like, I had to pick one
comic, so I went with Ralphie May.

2574
02:35:38,731 --> 02:35:40,620
I knew it was going to be a fat black guy.

2575
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:48,240
He had a pulmonary. Listen, how close
had been a black comedian anymore.

2576
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:53,160
Really southern. It's more and more
southern. Does he doing Fargo now?

2577
02:35:55,380 --> 02:35:59,400
He just, he just switched
it up a little bit. Ralph.

2578
02:36:00,030 --> 02:36:02,090
He's just getting out of the
hospital, you know? Yeah.

2579
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:05,250
He had a whole battery embolism
and there's part of me going,

2580
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:09,900
he's so many points at my death pool.
Oh, I'm doing good. And I'm like, oh,

2581
02:36:09,901 --> 02:36:12,900
that's my friend.
But if he lives or dies,

2582
02:36:12,901 --> 02:36:15,240
it's not stop my control.

2583
02:36:15,450 --> 02:36:19,590
I had to pick one comic and I had a who
did you just mentioned that was on my

2584
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:24,230
death pool. Oh, Joe Arpaio.
That's my wishlist. Oh,

2585
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:29,450
add one pig. That was a wishlist, which
was Nancy grace. Nancy grace. Now, um,

2586
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:30,840
now Joe Arpaio,

2587
02:36:31,770 --> 02:36:35,070
this all these weird border guys,
man,

2588
02:36:35,071 --> 02:36:37,350
that's a weird way to live,

2589
02:36:37,870 --> 02:36:42,220
man. You're living as the law enforcement
and a place that's known to have people

2590
02:36:42,221 --> 02:36:46,690
sneaking in from a third world country.
That's where things get crafty. You know,

2591
02:36:46,691 --> 02:36:49,270
things get real tricky when you're
dealing with that sort of a situation.

2592
02:36:49,271 --> 02:36:52,720
He got a bunch of people sneaking
into your state all the time. I mean,

2593
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:56,950
it's probably a reason why he's more,
more fucked up than anybody else.

2594
02:36:57,160 --> 02:37:01,870
And I want to, he's in Phoenix. No, he's a
fucking Egomania. Oh, he's nuts for sure.

2595
02:37:02,020 --> 02:37:06,580
But I mean that attitude is acceptable
somehow or another more down there.

2596
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:09,370
You know what I'm saying?
Like right next to the chaos.

2597
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:12,910
But it's easy to make an us and
them situation out of that. Sure.

2598
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:16,220
But people really want to stop that
nonsense mean they want to stop Mexico

2599
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,180
from coming in Arizona.

2600
02:37:17,181 --> 02:37:20,900
And one of the reasons why Arizona is
so like Republican and so you know,

2601
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:24,320
so right wing is because they're right
next to fucking Mexico. You know,

2602
02:37:24,321 --> 02:37:26,390
I think that's the same way Texas is,
you know,

2603
02:37:26,391 --> 02:37:28,310
and the same way southern California,

2604
02:37:28,311 --> 02:37:33,311
San Diego is really conservative to
you actually on a much smaller level.

2605
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:38,810
They fucking hate Canadians at
the border to do. They really,

2606
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:39,770
cause they don't tip.

2607
02:37:40,100 --> 02:37:44,450
Oh what are the fucking tipping is
one of the most important things.

2608
02:37:44,510 --> 02:37:47,720
I have no fucking work
the UK all the time.

2609
02:37:47,721 --> 02:37:51,590
And they're assholes as you fucking can.
I get ketchup.

2610
02:37:51,650 --> 02:37:55,460
Like normally this comes with ketchup
where I'm from and I don't want to put you

2611
02:37:55,461 --> 02:37:59,180
out, but can you get, and they've,
they're fucking cunts cause they,

2612
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:02,030
cause they don't work for tips. Yeah.
Yeah. We're giving tips. It's big.

2613
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:06,710
It's a good system. It's good. It's good
to be real generous. Tommy Lee Jones,

2614
02:38:06,711 --> 02:38:10,700
you just started getting some Tommy Lee
Jones with the new lighting. Really?

2615
02:38:10,701 --> 02:38:14,870
That's my new look, Tommy. Well, at
least you're going with good people.

2616
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:18,270
You know know the gay guy from no,

2617
02:38:18,350 --> 02:38:22,550
the horrible old Tommy Lee Jones.
Oh, the old covenant. That's sad.

2618
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:27,170
Sad, Bro. You end of this podcast
on a big downer note. We'd done. No,

2619
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:28,480
we're not done.
I'm just going.

2620
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:33,260
I gotta pee so I'm trying to think of
when to end this. Just go peace out.

2621
02:38:33,261 --> 02:38:38,030
Who's on your shorts back? Christine
Levine. Christine Levine. Wicked funny.

2622
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:42,590
Cool. She should be the new Roseanne,
but really no one will notice.

2623
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:46,170
Really awesome. Willing to charge
it out. Talked to Brian for it.

2624
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:47,600
I'm going to pee and then
we'll wrap it up with chuck.

2625
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:49,670
Let's talk behind his back.

2626
02:38:49,820 --> 02:38:50,620
All right,

2627
02:38:50,620 --> 02:38:54,010
let's do it like how we used to Doug
and he really doesn't like women though.

2628
02:38:54,490 --> 02:38:56,860
I know he hates it when
you say you hate women.

2629
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:02,800
That's what it used to be. Right? Like
he, he was really concerned about like,

2630
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:05,800
people are like, you're a woman
hater in it and drove him crazy.

2631
02:39:05,801 --> 02:39:08,690
And like when people say that to them or
something like that, remember that? Yeah.

2632
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:12,320
Yeah. No, he was a, I don't know if
he's still is like that, but yeah,

2633
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:13,330
he's so mellow now.

2634
02:39:13,331 --> 02:39:17,720
I've seen him fucking just dress
down a chick for no reasonable,

2635
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:23,140
some dumb chick. But that's what comics
thrive on. Still putting. We're not you.

2636
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:28,360
We need a dumb chick. Stop yelling
at her for being dumb. She's dumb.

2637
02:39:29,470 --> 02:39:31,900
She's here because she's dumb.
My favorite,

2638
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:33,840
my favorite part though
earlier was when you,

2639
02:39:33,841 --> 02:39:37,840
you call Joe Joey Diaz on that change
art. And he was like, what's a change jar?

2640
02:39:37,960 --> 02:39:40,590
And I'm like thinking like,
how do you not know how you fix it?

2641
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:42,010
I swear it was Joey Diaz.

2642
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:45,460
He fucking stole my change jar because
everyone would come in and out.

2643
02:39:45,461 --> 02:39:48,340
But only Joey was denying
that he was doing drugs.

2644
02:39:48,670 --> 02:39:53,670
So anytime someone's denying what
they are known for defensively,

2645
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:58,690
yeah. When's your next break? Cause you
usually never stole from you going Ah,

2646
02:39:58,770 --> 02:40:02,550
coked out of my brain and then just stole
your shit, right? No, I'm trying to,

2647
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:06,370
I'm trying to working out.
I'm trying to work it out and I'll

2648
02:40:07,970 --> 02:40:12,400
just borrow your VCR. My girlfriend
is really is addicted to flash dance.

2649
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:17,710
I can't believe they remade that movie.
Did are you taking a break soon?

2650
02:40:17,711 --> 02:40:20,070
Because I know you do like
stand up for like six months.

2651
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:22,500
You're on the road or something like
that and then you take breaks or

2652
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:25,370
yeah. Yeah. I always say I'm quitting.

2653
02:40:25,710 --> 02:40:27,210
I don't know.
Who knows?

2654
02:40:28,270 --> 02:40:31,420
I've UK dates booked after
that. I'm not bogus. Shit.

2655
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:34,800
You got in trouble last time you were
overseas, right? Like I remember seeing,

2656
02:40:34,830 --> 02:40:36,600
I remember seeing there was some,
like you said,

2657
02:40:37,250 --> 02:40:40,430
they are so easy to fucking
stir up fake fucking

2658
02:40:40,990 --> 02:40:45,580
the newspapers is so bored.
They have like 19 newspapers on an island.

2659
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:51,070
Right. Then it got some guy get
in trouble though or like some DJ

2660
02:40:52,030 --> 02:40:56,770
censored or something because he just
mentioned a youtube clip of mine.

2661
02:40:59,110 --> 02:41:00,410
Yeah.
What happened?

2662
02:41:01,300 --> 02:41:04,930
I was doing the BBC at sub
fucking poor bastard afternoon,

2663
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:06,790
like BBC snotty radio.

2664
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:11,320
They treat their radio like fucking
Winston Churchill still fucking talking on

2665
02:41:11,321 --> 02:41:16,000
it. And this guy isn't it? I did
a perfectly straight into, yeah,

2666
02:41:16,001 --> 02:41:20,170
we're performing here for
however long and blah, blah blah.

2667
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:24,720
And he goes, but you're a very
controversial, and I go, yeah,

2668
02:41:24,721 --> 02:41:26,920
well there's not none of that I can do.

2669
02:41:27,100 --> 02:41:31,120
So he just mentions if you don't
believe it's not for everybody,

2670
02:41:31,121 --> 02:41:35,710
if you don't believe it, see as Youtube
clip about Sarah Pailin and the old no,

2671
02:41:35,711 --> 02:41:40,420
not to. It's not. So people
actually went there. It's about,

2672
02:41:40,570 --> 02:41:42,340
it's just a dumb retard baby.

2673
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:47,880
It's a really funny bit.
How's it go? I don't know.

2674
02:41:47,890 --> 02:41:51,490
It's fucking railing on. Just
Sarah Pailin. Evan a retard baby.

2675
02:41:51,491 --> 02:41:56,180
And how she didn't use it in the
debates and I don't know, I never, I,

2676
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:59,060
I went back because the fucking guy,

2677
02:41:59,130 --> 02:42:03,280
it was almost fired from BBC for
mentioning that Youtube Clip.

2678
02:42:03,670 --> 02:42:07,300
He was being insensitive to fucking
retards or whatever they call them over

2679
02:42:07,301 --> 02:42:11,770
there wasn't your bit something
like she had a, what was it?

2680
02:42:11,771 --> 02:42:12,940
She had two sons.

2681
02:42:14,210 --> 02:42:14,860
Okay.

2682
02:42:14,860 --> 02:42:17,830
And they were both retarded.
How did it go? Yeah,

2683
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:21,100
one was at Down's syndrome
and the other was a

2684
02:42:21,230 --> 02:42:23,170
oh, uh, uh,

2685
02:42:24,250 --> 02:42:26,620
elected to go to Iraq
or something like that.

2686
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:32,340
I never watched him fucking clip until
it came up when he said it and I watched

2687
02:42:32,341 --> 02:42:34,330
a clip. I go, fuck. That was a funny bit.

2688
02:42:34,630 --> 02:42:36,820
He used to put so much
more effort into comedy.

2689
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:40,100
Do you do,
when you write,

2690
02:42:40,101 --> 02:42:44,660
do you like just think of ideas and like
remember them or do you take notes at

2691
02:42:44,661 --> 02:42:48,260
all or because you're constantly
coming at me, shit on my hand,

2692
02:42:48,470 --> 02:42:52,940
like my fucking attention span
and my memory is such shit. Now

2693
02:42:53,330 --> 02:42:56,930
you write them on your hand. I'll write
it on my hand until I get to a notebook.

2694
02:42:58,010 --> 02:43:02,060
I don't carry a fucking notebook. Do you?
If you have one of those droid phones,

2695
02:43:02,061 --> 02:43:05,210
you can actually die. I know, I
knew you were going to do this it

2696
02:43:05,500 --> 02:43:07,750
and then your bits will
be on Google's offices.

2697
02:43:07,850 --> 02:43:12,040
I'm in first class,
first class and I out my old fucking

2698
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:17,380
fucking dog yeared notebook to take notes.
And I go to the first class.

2699
02:43:17,720 --> 02:43:19,420
Um,
does anyone have a pen?

2700
02:43:20,470 --> 02:43:23,770
And I wanted to work on
my set on the way here.

2701
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:29,530
No one had a pen. Everyone had a
fucking, I'll text you at Bra. Yeah.

2702
02:43:29,531 --> 02:43:31,840
No, I'll just type it in the
air. A lot of drawing anymore.

2703
02:43:31,930 --> 02:43:34,420
I wonder what the fuck's going to happen
to cursive. It's that going to go.

2704
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:38,010
It's going to grow. I could not
write in cursive right now. Yeah.

2705
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:41,050
It's going to go writing itself. When
I have to write any guy, fuck it.

2706
02:43:41,130 --> 02:43:43,660
Send something and fill out an
actual piece of paper. I'm like, wow,

2707
02:43:43,661 --> 02:43:46,780
this is an alien thing. Making
a little mark. I have to,

2708
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:48,430
I hope you recognize my mark.

2709
02:43:48,460 --> 02:43:53,290
I fucking Accountant Harvey
Altman Ma mentioned to buy
a fucking seven hours ago.

2710
02:43:53,770 --> 02:43:58,120
Yeah. Can you just take
that out on my account or
something? You're my accountant.

2711
02:43:58,660 --> 02:43:59,860
Why do I have to write a check?

2712
02:43:59,861 --> 02:44:03,030
He's one of the fucking guys I
have to sit and write a check to,

2713
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:04,360
which is so forth.

2714
02:44:04,390 --> 02:44:07,480
He doesn't want the ability to just take
money out of your county, Michael Wacky.

2715
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:11,980
It's, we need bit coons.
Careful, bro. Bitcoin's Bro.
That's the internet currency.

2716
02:44:11,981 --> 02:44:16,270
Right. Well that leads us to our
next episode about fear factor too,

2717
02:44:17,030 --> 02:44:19,180
right?
Coming up on bankruptcy.

2718
02:44:21,050 --> 02:44:24,950
What do you think about this whole
bitcoin thing about the idea of a, I mean,

2719
02:44:25,060 --> 02:44:29,140
what is the concept of it is
it's a monetary form of currency.

2720
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:32,800
It's on the Internet. Right? And
people agreed to it. How does it work?

2721
02:44:32,801 --> 02:44:36,830
What's it back by [inaudible]
carrots. Stupid. Yeah,

2722
02:44:36,850 --> 02:44:40,150
but it's kind of interesting.
Not far, not even an hour. Um,

2723
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:44,530
it's interesting because, um,
our, no, it was pretty close.

2724
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:47,290
Um, because um, uh, the,

2725
02:44:47,291 --> 02:44:50,740
the bitcoins is like the first attempt
I've ever heard anybody coming up with

2726
02:44:50,741 --> 02:44:53,920
some sort of a currency. Even if it's
like really minor league. I mean,

2727
02:44:53,921 --> 02:44:55,990
remember what Napster was
like when it first came out.

2728
02:44:55,991 --> 02:44:59,350
That was pretty minor league. Look
what Napster became, you know,

2729
02:44:59,351 --> 02:45:00,760
all these years later, look at, you know,

2730
02:45:00,761 --> 02:45:02,590
you're getting songs
instantly on your phone.

2731
02:45:02,591 --> 02:45:06,130
That shizam thing where it's hooked up.
It tells you what the song is.

2732
02:45:06,131 --> 02:45:09,520
You play it, you press Shizam. There's
music playing you pressure exam.

2733
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:13,210
It records a song real quick for
like 15 seconds, sends it somewhere.

2734
02:45:13,211 --> 02:45:15,490
It sends it back to you,
tells you what the song is,

2735
02:45:15,491 --> 02:45:18,970
then gives you an option to buy it. It's
all right there on your fucking fallen.

2736
02:45:18,971 --> 02:45:20,350
I mean, that's, that's insane.

2737
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:24,850
I mean that there's never been anything
even remotely like that before, you know?

2738
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:28,720
Yeah.
I can text.

2739
02:45:31,450 --> 02:45:34,510
He's like Joey Diaz from
five to two years ago,

2740
02:45:35,230 --> 02:45:39,700
but I'm not angry about it. I like
what you find yourself railing against.

2741
02:45:39,701 --> 02:45:43,240
What's new is when you're old, that's
when you're your fucking grandparents.

2742
02:45:43,241 --> 02:45:47,350
They all right. I just, I, I don't
have the fucking, I don't need it.

2743
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:53,470
Like if I have a need to do all that
thing with a fucking cell phone, I don't,

2744
02:45:53,830 --> 02:45:56,890
I have no,
my life is really easy.

2745
02:45:57,460 --> 02:46:01,330
I've had a really good life
and I have no problems.

2746
02:46:01,570 --> 02:46:05,680
I don't need to fuck. I live in a place
I don't need to map quest anything.

2747
02:46:05,681 --> 02:46:06,820
Like it's over there.

2748
02:46:09,340 --> 02:46:13,610
I almost wish I wanted more.
Really?

2749
02:46:14,330 --> 02:46:16,160
That's interesting.
So what do you get your kicks out of?

2750
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:18,710
That was kind of the whole
point of the DMT trip,

2751
02:46:18,711 --> 02:46:20,690
which is unexplainable with you,

2752
02:46:21,170 --> 02:46:26,090
was about your desire and desire is
almost an anti Buddhist thing. But

2753
02:46:27,710 --> 02:46:32,300
yeah, I don't, I wish, I
wish I wanted more. Hmm.

2754
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:35,000
Fucking Louis C K said,
oh yeah.

2755
02:46:35,001 --> 02:46:40,001
I think he's a something I read
about myself after the Louis C K

2756
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:43,520
that was awesome. By the way, Doug,
that was really weird to watch because,

2757
02:46:43,521 --> 02:46:46,820
and I know you, but it was also, I
thought you did amazing in it. All right.

2758
02:46:46,850 --> 02:46:47,690
My favorite episode,

2759
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:53,150
I almost felt like I pause to shill
for applause and gave it to me.

2760
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:58,700
No a fuck. Now I don't remember
my point. You're Louis C K

2761
02:46:59,870 --> 02:47:01,670
we're talking about having joy.
Take a joy.

2762
02:47:01,671 --> 02:47:06,020
You wish you had more joy in what
you do. Yeah. No fucking yes.

2763
02:47:06,520 --> 02:47:10,790
I lost the point. Um, what, what
do you get your kick out of?

2764
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:13,910
Do you get your kick out of performing?
Do you get, you've got to killing still.

2765
02:47:13,911 --> 02:47:17,600
Do you still enjoy like a
fun set? No. No. Wow. Well,

2766
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:22,400
I know I'm always relieved that I
didn't have a shitty set at best.

2767
02:47:22,401 --> 02:47:27,350
Like is this psychological? I don't
know everything psychological. Right.

2768
02:47:27,351 --> 02:47:30,290
But I'm saying is this like something
that's changed in life and just the way

2769
02:47:30,291 --> 02:47:33,470
you've done, but I can't pinpoint
it because I'm a logical person.

2770
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:37,190
Like I can really, I don't want to
have to go to a fucking guy to talk.

2771
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:39,560
Like I try to find,

2772
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:44,360
that's why I'm not listening to your
boring fucking bar conversation because in

2773
02:47:44,361 --> 02:47:48,890
my head, yeah, I'm boiling something down
to a point in your head, your your work.

2774
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:52,890
My background can't find where
I became kind of miserable. Hmm.

2775
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:58,030
I know it somewhere around the breakup
with my wife but not connected like I was

2776
02:47:58,130 --> 02:48:01,070
kind of like in a manic phase anyway.

2777
02:48:01,460 --> 02:48:04,220
Well it's also could be the fact that
you're drinking a lot of alcohol on a

2778
02:48:04,221 --> 02:48:08,570
regular basis and that just really is
going to depress you and a certain extent,

2779
02:48:08,600 --> 02:48:13,030
it's not eliminated from the fucking
list of suspects. I'm, I'm, I'm,

2780
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,350
I'm really kind of tweaking
about this coffee thing.

2781
02:48:15,351 --> 02:48:18,920
It's very shocking to me how much
different I feel from not doing coffee for

2782
02:48:18,921 --> 02:48:21,950
eight days. You know? I really
didn't think it was going
to be that big of a deal,

2783
02:48:22,130 --> 02:48:25,040
but the, the, the big deal
is, and I'm not tired anymore.

2784
02:48:25,041 --> 02:48:29,180
I used to get tired in the
day, like somewhere in the
day I'd get tired, you know,

2785
02:48:29,181 --> 02:48:30,260
late afternoon or something.

2786
02:48:30,261 --> 02:48:32,930
And then I just have to force
myself to go to the gym.

2787
02:48:32,931 --> 02:48:35,510
So I'd have another cup of coffee and
then I'd fire up, then I'd go work out.

2788
02:48:35,511 --> 02:48:39,140
But I was tired when I got there. I'm
not tired anymore. I like the whole day.

2789
02:48:39,141 --> 02:48:42,830
It's like even, and I was like, oh,
this is what you're supposed to be like.

2790
02:48:42,980 --> 02:48:47,060
He's supposed to be even, you're not
supposed to be just fucking spiking every,

2791
02:48:47,061 --> 02:48:47,630
you know,

2792
02:48:47,630 --> 02:48:52,630
fucking hour and a half with some dark
liquid that fires up your fucking adrenal

2793
02:48:52,761 --> 02:48:53,594
glands.

2794
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:57,380
Gray. I'm about to phone
it in. Come on baby.

2795
02:48:57,381 --> 02:48:59,460
You're not phoning it in Tuck.
I love,

2796
02:48:59,590 --> 02:49:03,590
let me get you on fucking Kale
shakes this point. I love Bingo.

2797
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:06,890
Do you think maybe it's something
to do with relationship wise?

2798
02:49:06,891 --> 02:49:08,430
Cause say you don't have sex anymore.

2799
02:49:08,510 --> 02:49:12,150
I mean what do you need to show?
What the fuck's going on here?

2800
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:13,760
What's this love line here,
Brian?

2801
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:18,780
It's been since I've been a
fucking adult in any relationship.

2802
02:49:18,781 --> 02:49:22,680
The more the more you
like them as a person,

2803
02:49:23,130 --> 02:49:25,860
unless I want to fuck them.
Maybe your overall

2804
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:31,620
good Dick. I'm saying good
Dick. I don't know man.

2805
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:35,500
You think if you say laying
confidence doesn't mean she cared.

2806
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:36,930
It'd be you're hanging
out with the wrong crowd.

2807
02:49:37,050 --> 02:49:40,020
Maybe not hanging out with a positive
crowd. We need to move to la.

2808
02:49:40,490 --> 02:49:44,340
You might not have to move back or
to podcast comics. Sell fucking bag.

2809
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:47,050
Come hang on us. You can let
her know. You can live here.

2810
02:49:47,070 --> 02:49:47,903
We'd be here all the time.

2811
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:51,000
All you have to do is come
back here and we could do this.

2812
02:49:51,001 --> 02:49:54,060
We could fuck around like this all the
time and we do shows and has to leave

2813
02:49:54,061 --> 02:49:56,160
five foot. No you don't.
You don't have to live here.

2814
02:49:56,310 --> 02:49:59,080
You can live in fucking Crestline man.
You could live in the god Damn Mountain.

2815
02:49:59,090 --> 02:50:02,460
You can live in Pasadena. So town, it
was a town Crestline and the mountains.

2816
02:50:02,580 --> 02:50:05,040
Lake Arrowhead up in the mountains.
You don't, you don't have to live here.

2817
02:50:05,250 --> 02:50:09,750
You could live. There's a lot of spots
outside. No, no. I like small town.

2818
02:50:09,890 --> 02:50:13,860
I mean you can find small town like
knowing everyone's name at Safeway.

2819
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:19,090
I hear Ya. Hey, you love it then that's
good. But you could also have resume.

2820
02:50:19,380 --> 02:50:22,480
Should have got that small. Maybe go
do a residency, bro. You don't have a,

2821
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:27,420
would you have a dog to bring
them? Fuck it. Fuck no residency.

2822
02:50:27,450 --> 02:50:31,830
Wrong to a dog. Kind of talk back.
Speaking of the fucking Tucson,

2823
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:36,750
please help me. Oh, okay. When is it
the reality though? December 10th.

2824
02:50:36,870 --> 02:50:40,230
December 10th ladies and gentlemen get
on it. Where can they buy these tickets?

2825
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:45,010
It's Walsh, Brody Stevens, Brendan
Walsh, Brody Stevens at the fucking one,

2826
02:50:45,011 --> 02:50:49,870
three ups. Oh Jesus. Folks, we've got
music in the mix. Well, Neil Hamburg,

2827
02:50:49,880 --> 02:50:54,150
come on son. Never seen his act.
Heard good things. Who else? Uh,

2828
02:50:54,480 --> 02:50:58,110
Garret stab as a local
and of course a beautiful,

2829
02:50:58,111 --> 02:51:02,010
fantastic guests that from Ms.
Lynn Shah, Croft Shazamm. They go,

2830
02:51:02,011 --> 02:51:03,900
so that's a fucking hell of a show,
ladies and gentlemen.

2831
02:51:03,901 --> 02:51:07,980
Hell of a show December 10th get on that
Shit. And they can buy tickets where?

2832
02:51:08,610 --> 02:51:11,800
I don't know. Somewhere you can find
it here it out. You're not stupid.

2833
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:17,820
December 10th juice did,
but then I couldn't. Tucson,
Arizona, the Rialto theater.

2834
02:51:18,060 --> 02:51:22,260
Doug Benson and posse and crew.
You're, you're having fun, dude. Look,

2835
02:51:22,261 --> 02:51:25,230
you need to surround yourself with more
positive people. This is hurting me.

2836
02:51:25,470 --> 02:51:27,480
Hanging out with you here,
hearing you all bummed out.

2837
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:31,020
It's about really bummed out.
I'm just really fucking new at being.

2838
02:51:31,021 --> 02:51:33,730
I haven't gotten high in a fucking year.
Like is that what it is?

2839
02:51:33,731 --> 02:51:38,520
But you're being Debbie Downer a
little bit. I'm always a little bit,

2840
02:51:39,170 --> 02:51:42,230
he just, well, I mean,
you're not having sex to me.

2841
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:46,830
Hyper aware of everything other than
it's not a tripping is never good for

2842
02:51:46,831 --> 02:51:49,720
fucking entertainment. No,
it is. It is. It was just,

2843
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:54,090
I tried a small fucking porch and it's
still good. It's still good. It was fun.

2844
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:56,220
Those are fun. It's a fun
conversation. It's cool.

2845
02:51:56,250 --> 02:51:58,560
People enjoy these conversations.
They get to see you.

2846
02:51:58,830 --> 02:52:00,320
You know who you really are,
man.

2847
02:52:00,330 --> 02:52:03,030
They get to see all of us who we
really are and all sorts of different

2848
02:52:03,031 --> 02:52:04,470
situations with tripping.

2849
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:08,140
So more feedback about
the first one where I go,

2850
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:09,910
I that had to be boring to everyone.

2851
02:52:09,911 --> 02:52:13,540
It was just me talking to you
about old days and she was fun.

2852
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:15,790
People loved it.
But yeah,

2853
02:52:15,791 --> 02:52:19,360
you gotta think you have
a tendency to go negative.

2854
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:23,680
It's a tendency and you're thinking
to go negative and it unfortunately,

2855
02:52:23,681 --> 02:52:26,440
it fucking sets little triggers
in your brain and you know,

2856
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:30,130
it sort of defines your outlook on
things when you do that and you can,

2857
02:52:30,131 --> 02:52:34,390
you can fuck yourself in bad state of
mind. We can forgive fear factor too.

2858
02:52:34,391 --> 02:52:37,570
But if you start going
motivational speaker, Tony Robbins,

2859
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:40,740
I'm going to get one of those Bobbi Brown
headsets. I don't want to go out there.

2860
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:43,570
I'm going to show to people fives.
And you know what? The negative vibes,

2861
02:52:43,571 --> 02:52:47,500
creating negative atoms in your DNA,

2862
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:52,810
you make negative children. You don't
want that in residence is all off man.

2863
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:58,000
He needed a different crystal on your
neck. She'd be excited. Be Be excited.

2864
02:52:58,060 --> 02:52:59,080
Be.
That was the,

2865
02:52:59,230 --> 02:53:03,070
we could go off forever
about motivational speakers.

2866
02:53:03,070 --> 02:53:05,950
But the last thing I want to talk
to you about his comedy classes,

2867
02:53:05,951 --> 02:53:10,330
cause I thought this is really funny
how while cs I've talked to on the phone

2868
02:53:11,410 --> 02:53:16,240
again, it's like Dane Cook,
like I talked to Kyle, she's,

2869
02:53:16,241 --> 02:53:21,110
I go, it was, it was funny. It
created good Internet buzz. Yeah.

2870
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,200
It's a dumb thing.
I'm always,

2871
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:27,970
I don't have to be high to be hyper
aware of how pointless comedy is and the

2872
02:53:27,971 --> 02:53:32,080
fucking scam that we get away with doing
this for a living when it should be

2873
02:53:32,081 --> 02:53:35,290
free. You say that and I
agree and in a certain way,

2874
02:53:35,291 --> 02:53:39,900
but in another way I don't agree because
I was always happy to pay for it and I

2875
02:53:39,910 --> 02:53:43,960
enjoy it still as an art form. I think
it's the most fun form of entertainment.

2876
02:53:43,961 --> 02:53:48,580
I think that we've been in it for so
long, you know, I think for some of us,

2877
02:53:48,581 --> 02:53:53,350
we might've forgotten how much we
appreciated it in the beginning, you know,

2878
02:53:53,351 --> 02:53:57,670
forgotten. It's still the same thing.
I've always forget. I was always,

2879
02:53:57,880 --> 02:54:02,210
you're always hating it from
the beginning. No, not from
the beginning. 10 years.

2880
02:54:02,380 --> 02:54:05,410
I knew the Hollywood blow job
was like all this fallacy.

2881
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:10,480
I don't want to do anything more.
Say hedbergs joke about, Oh,

2882
02:54:11,860 --> 02:54:12,940
you're a comic.

2883
02:54:13,180 --> 02:54:18,180
Can you write or can
you act as was saying,

2884
02:54:18,670 --> 02:54:23,470
oh, you're a, you're a, you're a cook.

2885
02:54:23,530 --> 02:54:28,260
Can you farm?
Yeah.

2886
02:54:28,280 --> 02:54:30,980
I remember. Thank you for
letting me fucking embarrassed.

2887
02:54:31,030 --> 02:54:34,420
Mitch Hedberg is fucking grave.
He got through it though.

2888
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:37,490
You still got a good punch line out
of it because there was a pause. This,

2889
02:54:37,491 --> 02:54:39,950
you know, it's to be, if you
didn't, you didn't do a lot of,

2890
02:54:39,980 --> 02:54:44,650
I saw I've only had three drinks
by the way, in fucking three hours,

2891
02:54:44,651 --> 02:54:48,460
so not everything's great.
No worries. No, I'm just,

2892
02:54:48,461 --> 02:54:52,780
I'm worried about prayer.
You're fine. I can't wait.

2893
02:54:52,781 --> 02:54:57,520
21 years of comedy. Do you know how
many times I've played the Bray Improv?

2894
02:54:57,700 --> 02:55:01,420
Never really.
So if it goes poorly,

2895
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:03,950
I'm not worried about my career.
Do

2896
02:55:04,110 --> 02:55:06,760
it. It's a great comedy
club. Oh No, I love it.

2897
02:55:07,270 --> 02:55:11,530
I'm just praying this prayer is one of
the things we'd go in with that attitude

2898
02:55:11,531 --> 02:55:15,800
of it doesn't fucking matter.
You're usually funnier.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

2899
02:55:15,910 --> 02:55:19,010
And I'm looking forward to show
tonight, man. No pressure. No pressure.

2900
02:55:19,011 --> 02:55:21,680
I'm just going to sit and be creepy in
the back and if you're doing something I

2901
02:55:21,681 --> 02:55:22,850
don't like,
I'm just gonna shake my head.

2902
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:27,920
Put myself at like a really nice position
last night. Yeah, last night. Uh, I go,

2903
02:55:27,921 --> 02:55:32,350
yeah. Rogan said he's coming, but he's
no way he's coming. Why is he sad?

2904
02:55:33,110 --> 02:55:36,920
Because it's fucking Irvine
plastic. Yeah, no fucking way.

2905
02:55:37,070 --> 02:55:40,460
We already worked it out
that it was coming tonight.
Yeah. Well No. You said, Oh,

2906
02:55:40,461 --> 02:55:42,800
I'm going to come to both and I know
you're not going to come to both.

2907
02:55:42,801 --> 02:55:47,240
Who would say that? It's
high. It's ridiculous.

2908
02:55:48,970 --> 02:55:50,240
Why would you,
why would I?

2909
02:55:50,241 --> 02:55:53,690
That would be even creepier if I just
sit and watch the same James Robbins,

2910
02:55:53,691 --> 02:55:57,020
a man of his word. I go, no, he
stated flipping leaves and there's no,

2911
02:55:57,590 --> 02:56:01,850
there's no glass to the comedy.
Love you dad. There's no one joke,

2912
02:56:01,851 --> 02:56:06,851
no dead fucking Patrice O'Neal wrapped
up in a Greg Geraldo with a Freddy Soto

2913
02:56:08,331 --> 02:56:09,170
on top.

2914
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:13,850
There's no comedy worth
driving to Irvine from La.

2915
02:56:13,910 --> 02:56:14,743
That's not true.

2916
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:19,550
I was going to go see you if
you didn't do the podcast.

2917
02:56:19,551 --> 02:56:22,430
I know you were only doing Irvana
would've gone to see you there for sure.

2918
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:26,360
Cause brand to me is almost
a convoy of right now.

2919
02:56:26,490 --> 02:56:28,370
If you drive to the fucking Irvine,

2920
02:56:28,371 --> 02:56:33,170
they make traffic move as a
convoy with flags on Towncars.

2921
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:36,980
Oh,
I wish that'd be awesome.

2922
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:42,380
Could just have magic. I go,
Hey, I'll do your podcast. Uh,

2923
02:56:42,490 --> 02:56:47,490
I think we can con my record company in
a getting a driver and he Rogan goes,

2924
02:56:48,590 --> 02:56:52,760
ah, now I have my own service. I'll have
him pick you up at one 30. Good for you.

2925
02:56:53,880 --> 02:56:56,010
Because that odd, no, but the,

2926
02:56:56,011 --> 02:56:58,730
the fact that you have a bell that
you ring out on your porch too,

2927
02:56:58,731 --> 02:57:03,510
to summon the person. That's good.
No, no, that's affluence. But no,

2928
02:57:03,720 --> 02:57:07,880
that you're not someone I
feel uncomfortable around
like you and Ron White where

2929
02:57:07,881 --> 02:57:12,140
the two guys that I all right.
No matter how you're still,

2930
02:57:12,230 --> 02:57:16,960
you feel like you've changed. Who have
you ever met that the got some money,

2931
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:19,460
you know, for a lot of people,
you know what it is man.

2932
02:57:19,461 --> 02:57:22,580
They get something and then they don't
want to lose it and then they get scared

2933
02:57:22,581 --> 02:57:26,530
and then they clam up and then they stop
doing anything. Controversial styles.

2934
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:30,890
I know like a tell, I've never,
no one gets close to a towel.

2935
02:57:31,160 --> 02:57:33,470
Like he's just, well he's, you know what,

2936
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:37,610
I don't like to ever judge anybody
or look at them all in categories.

2937
02:57:37,611 --> 02:57:40,150
I just tell you who I love
and I love it. Tell, tell,

2938
02:57:40,210 --> 02:57:45,200
I would say is fucking pound for pound
as they say in your industry. The best,

2939
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:47,220
the best of our generation.
Um,

2940
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:50,960
I don't know if I can agree with that
because you know, quite honestly,

2941
02:57:51,170 --> 02:57:54,800
I shift back and forth on a bunch of
different guys. I go back and forth,

2942
02:57:54,801 --> 02:57:59,090
but I stopped trying to put them
in an order, but it Hedberg guide.

2943
02:57:59,091 --> 02:58:01,800
But like the joke for joke,

2944
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:07,100
no one has more fucking
jokes and personality than
a tell five jokes in a job.

2945
02:58:07,890 --> 02:58:11,700
I will never, you know, argue with you
on that. I just think he's amazing,

2946
02:58:11,701 --> 02:58:14,180
but I don't, I don't put them all
in an order, you know? I just have,

2947
02:58:14,210 --> 02:58:17,310
I've decided somewhere along the line
just to appreciate him. Don't try this.

2948
02:58:17,330 --> 02:58:21,750
A little trap for me at least. [inaudible]
Thompson part of it where you go,

2949
02:58:21,751 --> 02:58:25,680
would you want to be that miserable of
a fucking person to be that good to be

2950
02:58:25,681 --> 02:58:29,130
that funny? You think you're doing it?
He's one of us really knew by how much,

2951
02:58:29,131 --> 02:58:32,900
but yeah, no, he's really
like, he makes me like, I,

2952
02:58:32,901 --> 02:58:37,350
I go just, let's go to Costa Rica
together. Let's just go on vacation.

2953
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:42,560
But I got to this pilot and I just know
it's no good and I'm didn't find he had

2954
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:47,640
a DVD like for three years he's been
editing, but he hates every word of it.

2955
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:50,610
You're like,
great.

2956
02:58:50,611 --> 02:58:54,270
More fucking jokes in a
conversation while I'm drunk.

2957
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:58,200
Then I write in a fucking notebook
book in a year. Well he would,

2958
02:58:58,201 --> 02:59:02,250
he is as a real fucking professional.
It's a boot Koski thing.

2959
02:59:02,300 --> 02:59:06,630
You want to be that fucking miserable
of a person to put out that good art.

2960
02:59:07,050 --> 02:59:09,120
Me,
I'd rather fucking phone it in.

2961
02:59:12,230 --> 02:59:14,010
I honestly don't think it's an either or.

2962
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:17,640
I think you can just enjoy the whole
process. I fun. I love it. Hey,

2963
02:59:17,641 --> 02:59:21,240
faggot is about to email and
say this thing went on too long.

2964
02:59:21,241 --> 02:59:23,640
We have two minutes.
Pause and then uh, yeah,

2965
02:59:23,880 --> 02:59:26,610
hard for us right now because the,

2966
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:31,230
we're running out of space on the
iTunes. I want fried clams. Listen,

love you. Send our love sitting.

2999
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:21,730
Okay. He just got back from India. We

everyone know this? Yeah, exactly. Well,

3001
03:01:26,561 --> 03:01:29,650
I think that's going to change soon.
It's a jack and he's awesome.
