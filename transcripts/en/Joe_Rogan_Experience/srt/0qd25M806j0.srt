1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,310
I,

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,310
one of the most uncomfortable moments
in my life was me sitting next to Kareem

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,390
Abdul Jabbar.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,661
Actually,

6
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:14,190
I had to wildly uncomfortable moments
that involved Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,180
One is,

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,880
he just sat down on my
radio show and I was like,

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
you know,

10
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,820
you never see any,

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,690
any guys in their seventies
that are over six,

12
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,800
seven or six,

13
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,220
eight.

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,090
And I mean I,

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,650
you know,

16
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,230
I'm not trying to bring
you down you literally,

17
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,520
but is there some syndrome or have you
talked to somebody or how does it work?

18
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,360
Cause you just don't see seven footers
that are 80 years old but yet you seem

19
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,030
like you're in perfect health and I
don't know how it works and if there's

20
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,260
something that I'm not aware of.

21
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:43,980
And he's like,

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,880
what are you talking about?

23
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,163
And I was like,

24
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,590
you know how you don't
see a lot of old guys?

25
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,490
They're like over six,

26
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:50,971
five.

27
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:53,250
They seem to go a little earlier in life.

28
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:53,730
So my affect,

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,020
the little short Jewish guys,

30
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,220
the ones that go on forever,

31
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,610
is there some connection
correlation between the height
and the short longevity?

32
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,114
And he was like,

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,500
I never thought about it.

34
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,310
And I was like,

35
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,510
Oh shit.

36
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,081
Really?

37
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,770
And he's like,

38
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,071
yeah,

39
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,950
now I am this kind of comfortable.

40
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,670
Like I was like,

41
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,301
but no,

42
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,910
but I need to bring this up.

43
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,590
So he,

44
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:16,801
uh,

45
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:17,730
he did that to me.

46
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:21,150
And then we're like dodger
all star game or something,

47
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:21,871
celebrity game.

48
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:26,570
And we're sitting next to each other
waiting for the real dodger game to end in

49
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,210
like the,

50
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:27,511
you know,

51
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:28,650
the time it was Sorta,

52
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,310
you know,

53
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,420
dug out eating hot wings or something
like this up on the Lowe's level.

54
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,550
And some kid came by and said,

55
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,140
could you sign my baseball?

56
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,520
And I signed this baseball.

57
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,580
And then he handed it to Kareem
Abdul Jabbar and he said,

58
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,080
could you sign my baseball?

59
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:43,730
And he's like,

60
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,340
uh,

61
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,173
no.

62
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,020
And,

63
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,220
and the kid was like,

64
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,031
really?

65
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,180
Cause it just take a second.

66
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:49,690
And he's like,

67
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:49,910
I,

68
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,460
I'm not,

69
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,570
I'm not doing that right now.

70
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,490
And I'm seeing like right next to him.

71
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,350
And the kid comes back for a third,

72
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:55,831
like Ryan,

73
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:56,610
and he's like,

74
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:56,941
you know,

75
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,780
just real quick.

76
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,650
And he's like,

77
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,190
no,

78
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,850
I'm sorry.

79
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,210
Wow.

80
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,721
And I'm like,

81
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,680
just fucking sign it.

82
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:02,191
Just sign it.

83
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:07,191
And then he walks away and then his mom
shows up like 10 minutes later and she's

84
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:08,850
like,

85
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm so sorry to disturb you,

86
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,080
Mr Abdul Jabbar.

87
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,210
But um,

88
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,870
DePaul for my son,

89
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:17,010
he's such a huge fan.

90
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,420
Do you think you could just take a moment?

91
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,254
It's like,

92
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,831
sorry.

93
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,664
No.

94
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,870
And she's like,

95
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,111
just,

96
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:22,944
just a moment and,

97
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,783
and she's like,

98
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,121
no,

99
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:24,870
thank you.

100
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,703
And I'm just like,

101
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,090
I'm sitting next to him wanting to crawl
out of my urethra and just go under the

102
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:30,661
carpet.

103
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,494
You know that thing,

104
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,580
having to pretend like,

105
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,031
you know,

106
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,430
that body language that
says I'm not listening.

107
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,320
Like we can all know
the fake body language.

108
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,413
I am listening,

109
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,440
but I'm trying to discover the,

110
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,090
I'm not really listening.

111
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,390
You start leaning a little in God and she
really asked like three or four times.

112
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:48,160
He's like,

113
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,993
sorry.

114
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,801
No.

115
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,330
And she's like,

116
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:50,600
well,

117
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,211
I'm really,

118
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:53,340
because we could have
signed it in this time.

119
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:53,700
It took,

120
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,300
no,

121
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,133
I'm sorry.

122
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,973
No,

123
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,150
just like Holly,

124
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,901
I want to go.

125
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,860
I'll fucking sign it.

126
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,070
I'll your pussy whatever.

127
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,740
Please go away with tape.

128
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,170
Thank your son somewhere
and then it's fucked up.

129
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,870
He is.

130
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,170
Yeah,

131
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,530
I guess was dead,

132
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,364
right?

133
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,773
No,

134
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,123
no,

135
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,820
no.

136
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,653
The point is,

137
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,580
the point at which will
Chamberlain is done.

138
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,240
Yeah,

139
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,471
we'll,

140
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:17,050
it's dead.

141
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,530
The point,

142
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,363
the point is,

143
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,463
um,

144
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,820
I realize the guy seven four,

145
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,290
there's not a place,

146
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:23,810
it's,

147
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,000
it's about height.

148
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,280
I mean your spot and you're stopped.

149
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,420
He gets stopped everywhere.

150
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:28,840
He goes.

151
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,980
I'm not defending the guy,

152
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,670
but that guy has probably
been bugged for autographs.

153
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,730
None stop for 50 years.

154
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,700
And I bet he's just fucking
hadn't impacted asphalt of it.

155
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,141
Betty has,

156
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,080
but he should reconsider
the way that in that case,

157
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,400
especially little kids,

158
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,091
some kid,

159
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,230
and you can make their day.

160
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,610
It's so easy to make their day.

161
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,000
You're going to have to communicate with
them and he's right there and you're

162
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,920
sure that I'm preaching to
the choir talking to you.

163
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,761
You sure it was him,

164
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,001
right?

165
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,110
It wasn't a guy who just look like,

166
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,630
yeah,

167
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,040
it's a six [inaudible] four black guy
changed his name from Lew Alcindor Doula,

168
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,930
who was Lew Alcindor.

169
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,381
Yeah.

170
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,790
I was thinking like I was,

171
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,790
I was joking about this
once where I was saying,

172
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,050
you know,

173
