00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,310

in the motherfucking house.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,550
Joe Diaz on the way.
We're rolling.

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,540
Hey everybody.
What the fuck?

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,720
What's going on?
My Pal,

16
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,660
my neighbor winner of last comic
standing.

17
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,910
The Great John Hef.
Ron is in the house.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,920
UHM,
if you don't know,

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,320
has his own podcast now with another
hilarious guy,

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,230
John Reape,
who also is a winner of last comic

21
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:09,800
standing.
So to last comic standing champions

22
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,930
together on one podcast.
What do you guys call it?

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,410
Oh,
we're calling it the last podcasting,

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,890
the last podcast on.
Yeah,

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,210
we configure it.
The name like I,

26
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,120
I didn't want to kind of have like a
silly name.

27
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,800
Kevin Smith took the rubber off your,
your stuff it back on.

28
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,030
Yeah,
he's real particular.

29
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:26,490
It was really.
I mean I think these things are good.

30
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,450
The spit yields,
you know,

31
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:29,280
people like that pop and shit in their
ear.

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,500
But uh,
Kevin Smith likes to hear it raw

33
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,460
because,
you know,

34
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,750
Joe,
so I'm sorry.

35
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,501
So what do you call it?
The end.

36
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,450
What's the podcast?
Last podcast?

37
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,610
The last podcasting,
the last one.

38
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:40,300
Are you claiming this is it?
No one asked.

39
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,450
That'd be good just because it's
obviously playing on last comic

40
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,070
standing.
We didn't know if you want to call it

41
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,440
where you get a clown horn behind it.

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,430
Is the last comic standing like such a
big thing in your life that you would do

43
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:53,210
that?
It mean,

44
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,550
is it like,
is that like when you look back at your

45
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:57,860
accomplishments as a comic,
is that like the number one thing?

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,500
I don't think she'll personally,
but yeah,

47
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,110
it's one of those things you don't know
where your path would have went.

48
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,220
You like you.
So if I didn't do the show,

49
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,020
what I would just be just that headliner
who makes nothing just with a couple of

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,933
special things.

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,200
Kind of different than doing standup,
isn't it?

52
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:17,130
Because you're doing stand up and these
little short bursts for an audience and

53
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,470
you like trying to get them to vote for
you.

54
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,710
Did you find yourself like altering your
material?

55
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,280
What?
Because I'm long,

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,850
not long winded,
but my,

57
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,450
my jokes are are long so I'll stick with
the same subject.

58
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,970
Didn't have jokes every couple of
seconds.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Right.
So to do a four and a half,

60
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,620
five minute set is really hard for me.
Yeah.

61
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,180
And I did on my feet and I did 12,
five minute TV sets,

62
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,600
not repeating stuff.
So my brain doesn't click together.

63
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:46,870
Small sets like that.
So that was you that that must've been a

64
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:50,560
difficult counts.
Twelve I did five minute sets and other

65
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:53,210
other sees a whole hour of almost.
Yeah,

66
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,350
cause every material I got challenged
almost every episode.

67
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,160
So you perform then the next show and
for that don't understand why

68
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,620
that would be a big deal.
Here's why it would be a big deal for a

69
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,190
guy like John or a guy like me.
We have similar writing style so that we

70
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,310
we go into a bit and that bit will will
squeeze every thought out of that bit

71
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:16,921
and use it to transition to another bit
and those segways are kind of difficult

72
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,180
to do,
but it's very important to make sure

73
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,060
that the material flow seamlessly
together.

74
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,320
If there's a hiccup in the subjects,
then the audience can pick up on it and

75
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,300
it doesn't click with their brain as
much,

76
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,350
so it's really hard to do these little
five minute sets and break them up

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,940
because oftentimes one bit will lead
into another bit and one bid by itself

78
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,840
may only be like two minutes,
but it causes a 10 minute bit because

79
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,720
it's the catalyst for all this other
stuff that comes after it,

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,600
which you really just can't get away
with in a five minute set

81
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,600
like that.
It's real.

82
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,380
And then if you're used to not memorize
them but telling stories that way to go.

83
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,780
So what's with Mcdonald's?
I was in a car recently.

84
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,870
I hate flood and do that.
Your brain doesn't usually,

85
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,900
it's harder for me to say no or,
or remember perfectly a four and a half

86
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:03,860
minutes at then.
It would be for an hour and a half.

87
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,830
So do you think like as it's so
disjointed for me.

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,770
So do you think that that must have
helped you to,

89
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,750
as a comic?
Just the challenge of doing that.

90
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,350
Why did I.
So yeah.

91
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:17,460
So it was all those sets and then the
very literally the next day when I,

92
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:20,400
when I was performing when you a bunch
of theaters,

93
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,290
I felt the need to write a new hour as
fast as possible because people wouldn't

94
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:30,291
want to hear what they just heard for
nine weeks of Network television of

95
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:31,410
course.
So,

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,380
but so out of the 15 years leading up to
last comic,

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,940
I wrote what I think was a funnier our.
And I've gotten more out of that hour as

98
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:41,220
far as development deals and pitching
stuff to networks,

99
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,620
uh,
in probably two or three months just out

100
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:48,500
of sheer fear of I need to come up with
new material to survive or this is going

101
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:48,900
to stop.

102
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,070
Louis ck just had a video that I found
on the Internet.

103
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,890
Somebody posted on the message board
where he's talking about George Carlin

104
00:04:55,891 --> 00:05:00,030
and how George Carlin inspired him that
after like 15 years he was doing the

105
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,010
same act leg literally for 15 years.
And then he was listening to Carla and

106
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:07,080
talk about how he does comedy,
how he does it,

107
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,350
and he throws the whole hour away every
year and starts with a new one.

108
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,770
And you know,
in the Louis thought it was so crazy.

109
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,870
He was like crying in the car while it
was listening to this because he was

110
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:17,340
like,
is it a moment where it's like,

111
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:19,840
I fucking hate what I'm doing.
I stand up.

112
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,720
I said that,
that challenge.

113
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,680
Look how good he is now.

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,190
And it's funny.
I think habits are definitely

115
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,140
contagious.
You hang out with certain people that do

116
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,460
certain things,
you'll do that.

117
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,670
I just saw a Louis in San Francisco at a
show and then I went to his midnight

118
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:38,910
show and watched him and I left in the
week after.

119
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,180
I just saw,
there's a couple of weeks ago onstage,

120
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,280
I think I did 15 minutes of new stuff
just because the ceiling was raised.

121
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,270
You like you can go.
I do really well.

122
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:52,620
I crush it and then you see somebody who
is working on a new hour and for my hair

123
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:54,240
from the club.
He went there Wednesday,

124
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,530
figured out some stuff from my Sunday.
They go in those days,

125
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:00,310
his stuff became so tight because he can
go home and he'd.

126
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,270
Right.
So it inspired me to go,

127
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,240
right.
I'm going to do that.

128
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,470
I'm going to.
I'm going to do the same thing and in

129
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,590
some restructuring everything for that
reason where you just get

130
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,180
board onstage.
Yeah.

131
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,980
Getting inspired by the comics is the
greatest fucking thing ever.

132
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,330
It's a humbling thing.
You know,

133
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,660
you see someone who's really killing it
and it's like just how like a regular

134
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:21,590
person watches stand up and they can't
really quite believe that someone can do

135
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,140
that.
There's a lot of people that watch stand

136
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,460
up and they can imagine themselves doing
it well.

137
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,330
That same feeling,
you get kind of get that same feeling

138
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,320
when you watch someone who's really
great at it.

139
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,850
When you want someone who's really great
at you,

140
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,361
like,
oh,

141
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:36,020
this mother fucker just hitting heights.
Like you don't even want to know if you

142
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,580
can do that.
You know what I'm saying?

143
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,410
Like you don't even.
You don't even want to think about it.

144
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,760
All you want to do is just get to work.

145
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,670
Yeah.
It's Kinda like the one that guy ran the

146
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,320
first four minute mile.
Yeah.

147
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,170
And then everybody else started falling.
They're like,

148
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,580
oh,
there's a whole nother level.

149
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,760
Yeah,
except you can't.

150
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:53,450
You can think about running fast.
You can't think about getting funnier.

151
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,430
You know what I'm saying?
You just have to work.

152
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,090
You just have to work at it.
But when you.

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,800
When I say you can't think about getting
funnier when you can,

154
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,090
that's,
that's wrong.

155
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,730
I mean you can be unhappy and decide to
improve,

156
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,880
but that you can't be thinking about it
while you're up there.

157
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,580
I have to be funnier.
I have to be funny.

158
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:11,630
Or You just have to be in that fucking
groove.

159
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,600
You know what I mean?
You can't be thinking like that's a

160
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,960
thing that people don't understand.
Like you can't think I'm going to try to

161
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:18,990
be funny.
You can't.

162
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:19,310
Yeah,
no,

163
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,660
you're right here.
Right.

164
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,930
And I always tell younger comics,
the,

165
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,850
the guys who hang out with like open
mic,

166
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:28,270
her's with notebooks at get at coffee
houses.

167
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,960
He kinda learned to write that way and
they kind of stay at that weight.

168
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,430
I tell young guys got an advice.
Yeah.

169
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,730
Every Friday night come here and watch
somebody who's been doing it for 20

170
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:43,300
years and see what you don't like.
See what you do like it.

171
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:45,520
Start figuring out that way.
You know what I mean?

172
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,740
You know?
Yeah.

173
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:49,310
It's a,
it's a tricky game,

174
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,560
the standup comedy,
but it,

175
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,050
it,
it for me in this last week,

176
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:58,051
this happened after 23 years and how do
I write a solid Louis got motivated in a

177
00:07:58,571 --> 00:07:59,321
sense of,
okay,

178
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:01,090
I'm going to start challenging myself
there.

179
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,470
Um,
and then I decided to rework the entire

180
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:07,150
act,
like in this crazy.

181
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,860
No one will know the system that I have,
but yet it got me really,

182
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:12,580
really excited.

183
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,800
You stand up.
So this whole week when I was in Tampa,

184
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,210
no one will know the system that you
have.

185
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,050
What do you mean?
I won?

186
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:19,630
I did know.
It sounds like if you were watching,

187
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,040
you would never know that this went
down,

188
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,550
but I want to construct my whole act as
the hero's journey.

189
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,490
Like in every movie you see about 10
minutes into the movie,

190
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,030
something crazy happens to the character
that spins them off in the movie while

191
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:34,630
I'm trying to put my whole act together.
We're at 10 minutes in I,

192
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,060
I tell you I don't,
I don't know if I got to make a

193
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,560
decision,
I might want to get divorced.

194
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,770
And then suddenly the crowds like what?
And then it's my journey and then the

195
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,190
thing I got this huge master plan,
it's how I've always done my act,

196
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,240
but I'm really going to try to hit beats
where suddenly you're going to have a

197
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,650
romantic part in the middle of it to
take

198
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,870
no,
but listening,

199
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,430
you're just going to laugh.
Can a romantic.

200
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,930
What is this Jim Carrey movie?

201
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,870
It's something called like Philip
Morris.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,320
I Love Philip Morris and it was a
Netflix film.

203
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:04,801
I was like,
wow.

204
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,810
I like Jim Carrey and it here in
Mcgregor.

205
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,750
And then I'm like laying in bed last
night after watching red state.

206
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,250
And I watched it and I was like
disgusted.

207
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,900
There was parts where Jim Carrey was
fucking guys from behind very violently

208
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,350
and you,
he has a shirt off,

209
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,480
he's got to come in me.
And I'm like,

210
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,160
what?
This is not a crushed ice.

211
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,440
Ventura is now a fucking whatever.
And so then it.

212
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,050
Then there's a part where it Ian
Mcgregor and he's got this horrible

213
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:37,950
bleached hair and half of it's spent in
jail where like there's just a bunch of

214
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:41,130
gay sex going on in jail and then make
it at the beginning of the movie they

215
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,550
say it's like this all happened like
this is a real story or something like

216
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,060
that and it is the most craziness.

217
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,490
Craziness.
Moving.

218
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,730
Try to censor myself.
It's the gay ass movie I've ever seen

219
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,860
because I don't want to hurt his gay,
but he's feelings.

220
00:09:56,861 --> 00:10:00,450
I don't want hurt.
Retards feel you're not having sex with

221
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,500
each other.
It's pretty good.

222
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,780
That was a joke.
I'm just kidding.

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,320
No,
but it was best to be on a shirt.

224
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,210
It was really.
It was the weirdest thing.

225
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,270
Seeing two guys just making out that
you're like,

226
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,940
like with like bag for comedy on mouth.
Mouth to mouth.

227
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,700
Like you're making out with the jet.
I what the fuck are you doing

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,830
greg?
It was just making out with dudes.

229
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,810
Yes.
Tongue.

230
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,500
Jim Carrey was just fucking stupid.

231
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,150
Were Gay and it was neat to see that as
often.

232
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,060
You know how like when most rated r
movies,

233
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:36,800
you never like see a girl's pussy,
like they never left over and show you

234
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:39,410
their pussy,
but yet you'll see them naked.

235
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,550
It's like,
it's okay.

236
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,680
I understand.
I understand that this is going on.

237
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,220
If there's a guy kissing another guy,
I feel like you don't have to show me

238
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:47,660
their tongue touching.
I believe you.

239
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,780
That's when you reach.
You're going to the refrigerator to get

240
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:53,660
some Bagel bites.
Start Microwave and those look down for

241
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,120
it.
Yeah.

242
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,400
Yeah.
You want to freak me out,

243
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,640
get good touch and tongues that I know
our street.

244
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,390
That's why it's so hard when you got a
straight actor and another straight

245
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:07,391
actor and you're making them make out.
What kind of game is this?

246
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,350
The whole movie is based on dirty,
Raunchy,

247
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:13,530
gay sex,
brokeback mountain.

248
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:13,981
They were like,
dude,

249
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:17,640
we're going to go times to now we're
just going to have Jim Carrey and a

250
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:19,510
fucking jet.
I just fucking everywhere.

251
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,740
But Sex and sex.
Was it a comedy or is it a like?

252
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,450
Absolutely not funny.
The whole time I was sitting in there,

253
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,850
I'm asleep so my girlfriend wouldn't
think I was gay watching this movie.

254
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,701
Was it like,
what?

255
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:34,650
Is it supposed to be a funny huh?
Is it supposed to be a comedy?

256
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:39,651
Like tomatoes gave it a 71 percent.
That's pretty God damn strong.

257
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,660
They're all cock suckers.
That rotten tomatoes.

258
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,080
Damn.
I need to see this.

259
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,510
Actually,
we don't know everybody.

260
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,230
We know Roger Ebert loves man in a
woman's sex.

261
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,860
I need to see this

262
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,700
officer turned.
Con Man who made the leap to white

263
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,740
collar criminal after being sent to
prison.

264
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,160
Don't need to see it,
man.

265
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,860
The whole movie.
Jim doesn't say anything about crazy

266
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:05,390
buttocks in here.
The whole movie.

267
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,960
Jim Carey's a looked so weird.
I couldn't tell if he was wearing a wig

268
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,810
or if he just had the creepiest hair
ever.

269
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,960
Like if he was in character like because
it was kind of like forrest gump for gay

270
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,980
people or something like that.
Like he's like,

271
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,450
I've been to prison.
Decided to suck that guys Derek,

272
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:21,710
you know,
like he had like a.

273
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:25,220
It was from Texas that it took place in
Texas and it was like they all had that

274
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:28,460
little time bubble shrimp,
you know,

275
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,540
but it,
it,

276
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,770
I don't remember what I was talking
about tech.

277
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,290
You were talking about bud sites and Jim
Carrey and.

278
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,560
But Jim Carrey looked really crazy like,
like he had like this weird for La,

279
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,670
like headline.
I can't tell if it's really his hair's

280
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,880
receding or he had like a weird dumb and
dumber kind of haircut and it was creepy

281
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:53,390
on top of already a creepy movie carries
a good actor.

282
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,690
Yeah.
It's a lot of people that don't give

283
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,060
that guy credit.
He can fucking freak you out.

284
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,590
That,
that cable guy thing.

285
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,110
Remember when we played the cable guy?
That was a weird role,

286
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:01,720
man.
He,

287
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,930
he played that good.
He can do some shit,

288
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:06,540
man.
I'm a big Jim Carey Fan.

289
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,130
I know a lot of people.
You know,

290
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:11,820
there's something that people think
about him being like real big and silly

291
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,850
like ace Ventura,
that somehow no,

292
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,670
there's something wrong with that.
Like it's pandering or it's low brow or

293
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,140
whatever.
I just think he's funny.

294
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,060
I don't need to be intellectualized with
my funding.

295
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,880
Imagine in sucking a dick.
Watch this movie.

296
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,060
Even has that hair to where it was down.
Like kind of like reversing the dude.

297
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,560
He was sucking Dick fucking guys in
assets.

298
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:35,810
He was like,
not showing it obviously,

299
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:38,390
but it was very good that did show him
kissing.

300
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,171
Oh,
they shut them.

301
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:41,780
Making up tons of respite sling between
the guys levels.

302
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,710
I'd rather see a dude fucking the guy in
the ass and kissing,

303
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,790
kissing,
kissing is disgusting regardless.

304
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,590
Well,
I know a dude with a heart on it was

305
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:54,800
very confused as it is.
You know,

306
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,690
dealing with a heart on is basically
just a sperm machine.

307
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,520
You're just managing this fucking
unstoppable sperm machine that's on

308
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,770
autopilot.
That's what a dude with a heart on this.

309
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,910
So if you just woke up and you find your
deck and a guy's ass like God dammit,

310
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,840
now what to do.
There's a big difference by kissing.

311
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,430
That's like a thing.
Do I go in first?

312
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,410
So I kept my head.
You're really thinking about guys,

313
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,740
fuck guys in prison,
but total kiss too much.

314
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,240
You know,
probably not.

315
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,070
They made it sound like they made it
sound like the whole thing with the

316
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:27,590
prison system was like,
you could either get,

317
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,950
you know,
soap or you can get a sand to clean

318
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:33,710
yourself and that shower,
you get soap if you suck my Dick,

319
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:34,670
you know,
things like that.

320
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:38,390
Like they made it seem like the prison
system was all completely about sucking

321
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,400
Dick.
Like if you want your mail,

322
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,640
you have to suck my dick and
I,

323
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,150
I just,
I want to know if this is one a true

324
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,350
story.
I don't think it is or not,

325
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,910
but,
but to the guy,

326
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,750
if I,
I want to know

327
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,300
what the Jews movies I wouldn't to.
I was too tired,

328
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,690
was like 6:00 AM.
I was too tired to like Google the guy's

329
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,910
real name to see if it was a real story
or not.

330
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,730
I bet it is.
I get the fuck happened at the Abbey and

331
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,860
just look it up.
Look it up.

332
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,600
See if it's a real story.
That's what I want to know.

333
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,870
What the real story of just a guy
hooking up with a real guy about scam

334
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,550
artists that just love to suck.
Dick screenwriters,

335
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,990
Glen Feet,
cholera and John.

336
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,280
Sorry guys,
if I said your name wrong,

337
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,970
Benson,
well these guys are.

338
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:29,360
PSYCHOS was bad.
Guy Goes,

339
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,040
oh,
I need to see this man.

340
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,250
Hey,
they're probably just sitting around

341
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:32,841
like,
let's see.

342
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,610
Jim Carrey sucks Dick.
Dude,

343
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:36,920
I need to see this.
I did not know that this was such a

344
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:37,860
fabulous movie.
Never.

345
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,470
Yeah.
Would you imagine you're sitting going,

346
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,850
oh,
I'm going to write a script.

347
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:43,220
You know what?
Let's sit down and your first thought is

348
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,770
Guy Sucking Dick.
Oh,

349
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,340
it was.
It was be like,

350
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,200
how could I do an action movie where
guys,

351
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,061
why not?
Dude,

352
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,920
listen,
if you only make a really good movie

353
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:54,290
about Guy Sucking Dick,
good for you,

354
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,820
man.
Maybe this movie,

355
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,820
this is Brian disagrees on a lot of
movies.

356
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,290
Maybe this is an amazing human because
look is 71 percent on rotten tomatoes

357
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,330
and tomato 71.
I think the biggest thing was saying

358
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:11,480
good,
Jim Carrey doing mcgregor tears like

359
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,100
big.
Here's the big tests.

360
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,130
Ready,
here's the big tests.

361
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay.
I say I trust rotten tomatoes.

362
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,310
I say rotten tomatoes generally
represents how I feel about movies.

363
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,400
Pretty accurate.
So let's type in

364
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,180
boondock saints
and this will discuss this.

365
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,530
This will be it for me.
Type type in red state.

366
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,400
Oh,
I wrote boondock saints.

367
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,100
John,
have you seen this Jim Carrey movie?

368
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,993
No,
I have not.

369
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,420
Will you watch it?
Not,

370
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,760
not after that.
I just know I'd rather see a 17 percent.

371
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay.
Yeah.

372
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,010
Look rotten tomatoes is on point.
Rotten tomatoes is on point.

373
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,730
All right.
Type in [inaudible] 71 then that moves

374
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,490
in red states.
Don't do it yet,

375
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,070
but you'd love to read it.
And that was like the best movie ever.

376
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,040
I haven't seen.
I don't know what it is.

377
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,450
Forty percent.
That's.

378
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,370
No,
I really liked that movie.

379
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:12,380
I thought it was way better than that,
but I've talked to people in line.

380
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:13,270
I didn't like it,
man.

381
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,460
Rotten tomatoes is not accurate.
One hundred percent.

382
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,420
I think it is and I think Phillip Morris
might be the best but fucking movie in

383
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,390
the history of the movies.
I think I got to go with that.

384
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,050
I wish rotten tomatoes was just tuned
into what you like,

385
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:26,910
you know,
you could say,

386
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,330
what's giving your favorite movies?

387
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,280
Maybe there's a program like that you
can say,

388
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,960
give me your favorite movies.
What?

389
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,900
What music do you listen to?
You married,

390
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:35,950
single,
divorced.

391
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:39,280
How old you are you healthy?
Do you exercise?

392
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,080
Throw that shown that you're sleepy
every time you want to watch a movie,

393
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:45,740
tell me what's good out there,
man.

394
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,050
Do you go to cheesecake before the movie
and get the full?

395
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,720
Do you do that problem is that you'll
never expand.

396
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,000
You'll never become someone other than
who you are.

397
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,040
They'll just keep giving you the same
influences.

398
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,860
Their genius.
They kind of do that with music.

399
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,070
They don't dope and a lot of times it's
pretty.

400
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:02,581
You Go,
yeah,

401
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,120
I would have put together this playlist.
I just got appletv Oh yeah,

402
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,290
I've had it.
I've had it for years.

403
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,240
Fucking awesome.
Beautiful.

404
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,550
No.
Have you done that

405
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,280
thing where you've,
uh,

406
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,690
you've filmed video with your phone and
then just push a button and it

407
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,310
click it.
Yeah.

408
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,590
That's incredible.
That's incredible.

409
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,551
That the,
uh,

410
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21,440
the,
the ability to play songs from your

411
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:24,160
phone,
one of you guys podcast on [inaudible],

412
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,080
there's a podcast thing popped up and
just hit play.

413
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,500
The most amazing thing is I went to
documentaries just so I'm thinking,

414
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,460
you know what,
what do they got?

415
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,490
They got fucking page after page after
page of all the best document to watch.

416
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,930
I got red state,
I rendered red state.

417
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,280
Do they have everything?
The corporation they have like pretty

418
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:48,281
much every documentary of mainstream
documentary I've ever seen is on this

419
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,790
apple thing.
I watched the man on the night and

420
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,950
dungeons and dragons.
I mean there's a lot of your,

421
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,430
there's a lot of obscure documentaries
that don't make it to there I'm sure,

422
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,970
but they had driven the Jens pulver
documentary,

423
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:05,270
which is pretty obscure even in the
world of mixed martial arts.

424
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,010
I don't know a lot of people who know
about it,

425
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,873
you know.

426
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,340
No.
You have your vimeo channel on there

427
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,450
now.
I just sit there and watch all the

428
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,480
fucking podcast that we do at death
squad from on my apple TV.

429
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,740
That's the whole thing on there.
And,

430
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,540
and the,
the only thing I liked about Roku that

431
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,740
was better,
which was the exact,

432
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,360
it's the exact same thing.
Pretty much ones.

433
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:24,790
Apple.

434
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,880
When did you say you have the,
your death squad podcasts on Vimeo.

435
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,233
How do you have

436
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,690
just upload them onto a vimeo?
Every time we do one,

437
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,540
we should do that with them.
This to.

438
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,520
Yeah.
Why don't we do that with us?

439
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,930
I don't know.
Okay.

440
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,290
Let's do that with this
mother fucker.

441
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,310
But you had more of a statement than a
hey,

442
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,010
what do you think we should?
Yeah,

443
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,160
why wouldn't you do that with this side?

444
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,460
Uh,
well the business stuff or I'll tell you

445
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,420
later.
Oh,

446
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,900
business stuff.
Uh,

447
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,340
okay.
If you want to talk about it on air

448
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,460
weekend,
it might be,

449
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,270
it might be tricky.
Uh,

450
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,240
yeah.
So anyways,

451
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,490
um,
but you know,

452
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,650
episodes on your,
you can watch the death squad and listen

453
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:08,090
to it.
I'm just watching the VIMEO channel.

454
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:09,890
You watch it and listen to it.
It's,

455
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,510
you know,
you're just laying in bed.

456
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,020
And so you're filming your stuff on
Vimeo as well as putting it on ustream?

457
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,910
No,
I'm just taking my seat.

458
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,930
What happens is you use stirring for me,
uh,

459
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,440
crashes all the time because I have ads
and commercials where you got privileged

460
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,610
to get all that taken away.
Uh,

461
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,870
for my watchers,
they hate using this service,

462
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,070
which is understandable.
It's some of them,

463
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,710
some of this stuff.
A lot of people complain about those

464
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:35,620
ads,
so I stopped the whole screen.

465
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,220
You miss a chunk of the podcast,

466
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,260
right?
So I took all my stuff after it's

467
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:43,800
broadcast live,
I take it off your stream and put it on

468
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:48,790
Vimeo just because I have a pro account.
I never used vimeo and now that apple TV

469
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,550
started vimeo on the apple tv,
I was like,

470
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,740
you know what,
I'm moving everything to vimeo now

471
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,740
because Vimeo,
my youtube accounts always get canceled.

472
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,110
They always get busted.
Like I had a director account,

473
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,550
which I don't know you when you first
signed up for Youtube back in the day

474
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,240
view made longer videos that were like
over 10 minutes,

475
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:09,130
which is what the limit was at that
time.

476
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,680
You could apply for a thing called a
director account,

477
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:13,870
which gave you access to put movies on
there,

478
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,320
like Youtube was trying to reach out to
small independent directors.

479
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,190
I got that account.
They stopped that a year later and now

480
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:23,260
the only.
You have like 15 minute limits on

481
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,450
youtube.
Nobody has any longer and Listeria

482
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,440
company.
How come I see that though sometimes

483
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,400
because all the director accounts got
grandfathered.

484
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,550
Oh Wow.
So Youtube recently took my director

485
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,590
account away so I can't do that on
youtube anymore.

486
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,780
Yeah.
We used to be able to upload longer shit

487
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,880
and I remember I tried to upload one of
the podcasts video blogs that we do on

488
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:49,030
Vimeo.
We have 10 of them up there and what we

489
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:53,200
do is after we have an interview,
we sit down and we videotape like,

490
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,300
oh that was fun.
We'd shoot the shit for a little bit and

491
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,240
get to just whatever.
It's just something else to do.

492
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,080
Just fine,
you know.

493
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,610
So we started putting those up on Vimeo,
but they're like way better quality than

494
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:07,090
Youtube and they let you put like 15,
20 minutes.

495
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,180
I don't give a fuck,
you know,

496
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:12,160
like do it as long as you want.
Youtube is like smaller and shittier

497
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,810
quality.
I guess some.

498
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,570
Some of the youtubes or a nice hd now
too.

499
00:22:16,571 --> 00:22:17,141
Right,
right,

500
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:17,531
right.
Yeah,

501
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:21,370
but that's why I use
vimeo just looks better,

502
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,230
doesn't it?

503
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,400
Well,
vimeo actually from testing used to be

504
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,470
eight.
Youtube does a great job,

505
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,480
but their hd stuff,
if you do it right and you follow the

506
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,640
right code x,
they're perfect and they're in more

507
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,160
devices.
Smartphones,

508
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,550
they actually have it down.
Pat.

509
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,130
Vimeo is kind of cool.
It's a smaller company.

510
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,570
I wouldn't say.
I think they're up to par now that,

511
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,740
but for awhile I thought Youtube hd was
actually a lot better,

512
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,750
but our shit looks better on Vimeo than
it looks on Youtube.

513
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,880
Well,
you might see the.

514
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,420
One of the things that youtube is,
when you're watching a video on youtube,

515
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:54,660
it always defaults to like a lot of
times it defaults to the lowest

516
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,190
resolution and so if the research,
like vimeo always put you in hd when

517
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:01,940
you're on their page,
so a lot of times that's what it is.

518
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,240
It's just a simple thing like that,

519
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,000
oh fuck you.
Youtube.

520
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,730
Well,
youtube has a lot more users.

521
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,190
They're definitely trying to save
bandwidth settings.

522
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,370
There is settings in your youtube
account that makes it so it's always

523
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:16,070
playing hd and always the best,
but it's not defaulted to that.

524
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,470
Speaking of Youtube,
did you see that video that they just

525
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,200
put out of the chimps that were locked
up?

526
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,420
They never saw sunlight for 30 years.
They want to believe they were stolen

527
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:30,260
from their mothers at birth and taken to
Austria and they were used,

528
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,630
uh,
in the labs where they were shot up with

529
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:37,280
hepatitis and HIV and then they released
them from this.

530
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:38,070
And then the,
uh,

531
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,400
the,
they let these chimps outside for like

532
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:43,970
the first time ever.
It was crazy to see.

533
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,220
And if you see that,
you still think people should be

534
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:48,620
experimented on champs.
You're a sick fuck.

535
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,300
Those fucking things.

536
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,390
Getting think man.
Those things can think and they feel and

537
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,340
they have emotions.
They're smart.

538
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,010
And when they got outside and they
started seeing the sun,

539
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,680
they started jumping up and hugging each
other,

540
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,180
making each other and looking out and
trying to figure out how to.

541
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,150
How to walk on the grass and touching
things and hugging each other and

542
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:10,670
laughing.
That is.

543
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,700
That is the craziest thing that we
justify is taking intelligent animals

544
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:19,040
and holding them captive.
Whether it's dolphins or chimps.

545
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,770
That is a fucking weird thing,
man.

546
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,890
I mean that is like slavery.
It might as well be slavery.

547
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,860
If you know how smart champions locking
them up like that,

548
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:28,490
you,
you might.

549
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,800
It might as well be slavery.
Imprisoning them,

550
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,660
stealing them from their mothers.
Like,

551
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:34,760
whoa man,
that's,

552
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,480
that's pretty fucking rough.
You're causing some serious pain.

553
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,840
So real emotional pain.
And these poor animals.

554
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,310
Smart fucking animals too.
Because it's a weird video,

555
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:47,420
man.
It's really creepy.

556
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:50,960
It makes you feel bad to be a person.
It makes you feel bad at someone's doing

557
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:52,070
stuff like that.
You know?

558
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:53,180
I know there's a lot of people out
there.

559
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,290
Fuck you,
man.

560
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,220
If it wasn't for those
really,

561
00:24:58,221 --> 00:24:59,660
are you sure?
Yeah.

562
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,370
Vaccines are awesome.
Don't get me wrong,

563
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,920
it is awesome that they figured out a
way to cure a lot of diseases.

564
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:08,270
You're absolutely right,
but at what cost that cost?

565
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,510
Is that the only way to do it?
I'm down with you doing shit to a

566
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,040
rabbit.
You want to fuck with a rabbit.

567
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,590
It doesn't really bother me,
but when they can think,

568
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:17,840
when they're smart.
I know rabbits get scared.

569
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:19,910
It sucks to be them,
but they're fucking rabbits.

570
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,390
All right.
The new people don't want to hierarch

571
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:26,000
animals,
but there's a reason why some animals

572
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,670
just sit around and eat and shit and
that's it,

573
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,060
and then there's other ones that are way
stronger than eat those motherfuckers.

574
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,950
That's why those motherfuckers are
there.

575
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,900
Their food,
they might not know it.

576
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,490
You know?
They think they're just grass eaters.

577
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,220
They all serve a little piece,
a little piece in the pie,

578
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,270
but chimps,
chimps are so close to us to lock them

579
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:46,580
up like that and see them come out of
this thing.

580
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:49,040
It was really heartbreaking.
It was really confusing.

581
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,091
You know?
It's like,

582
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:50,570
wow,
this.

583
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,960
This doesn't seem to be something that
we should be doing in 2011.

584
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,850
It doesn't seem like we should be doing
any studies on chimps at this stage.

585
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,980
It's like we know enough about human
beings.

586
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:03,140
We know enough about feelings and
emotions.

587
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:06,830
We know enough about how close they are
to us and yet we're still willing to do

588
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,150
this.
That's fucked up.

589
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,390
I'd be better.
I'd be happier if they were doing it to

590
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:14,900
murderers happier if they were doing the
shitheads rapists.

591
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,750
You know what I'm saying?
There's a lot of confirmed out there.

592
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,590
Some confirmed jailed up cons.
Have you learned through experiments for

593
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:23,360
real?
Why don't we do it on them?

594
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,291
I mean,
people go,

595
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,420
you can't do them to voluntary.
I know,

596
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,610
but you know what?
So is rape and murder.

597
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,700
If someone's acutely,
if someone is guilty of rape and murder,

598
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,830
then the question is how do you know for
sure that they're guilty?

599
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:36,230
They didn't just get fucked by the
system because they have no money and

600
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,190
they couldn't afford a good lawyer,
but that are that go.

601
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,691
No,
I.

602
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:42,710
I killed all 12 of them.
They were sleeping in their beds.

603
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,430
Yeah.
Came through the window and I killed

604
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,360
them off the articles.
Yeah.

605
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,170
Yeah.
Fucking experiment on them.

606
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,010
Leave those chimps.
Chimps never did shit to nobody.

607
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,370
You don't have to steal them from their
mother's little baby champs and final

608
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,870
white discount on them and ship.

609
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,601
But why don't we?
Why?

610
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,630
Why can we?
Because people are pussies.

611
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,570
That's why we're going to kill them.
You should like that week ahead of time,

612
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,990
she'd be all exterior Jason Bourne and
look how that worked out.

613
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,940
Well,
I was a member of the Ted nugent message

614
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,410
board.
I tell you that.

615
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:13,050
What the fuck the problem is the God
damn liberals,

616
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,710
but they're right.
I mean there's the liberals is the idea

617
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,870
of constant compassion and the need to
to treat all human beings is absolutely

618
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,080
equal despite their past and what
they've done.

619
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,080
Listen man,
if you're some fucking religious person

620
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:32,010
who's completely recanted from your
horrible life and it seems that you've

621
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:32,850
done,
you know,

622
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,770
like as much as possible to,
to make up for your shitty actions in

623
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,660
the past,
there's people that have made mistakes

624
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,460
and they've turned their life around.
I completely,

625
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:42,300
totally believe that.

626
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,760
But then there's also cons.
Yeah.

627
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,600
You know,
it's,

628
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,890
it's up to us to figure out who they are
and just experiment on them.

629
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:52,410
Man.
You're on your fourth trip to Aruba.

630
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:55,350
Coming back by yourself even though you
and your girlfriend went,

631
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,210
yeah,
you should get hooked up to your net.

632
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,190
Why does it always happen in a room?
But I know.

633
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,650
I know.
What is it?

634
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,400
Is it people saying no?
Is it girls turning guys down and the

635
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:08,010
guys being mad?
Is it someone getting jealous?

636
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:11,100
Is it just cycled?
Last one was a guy who met a girl online

637
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:13,080
fluor to.
They're on vacation.

638
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,120
His girlfriend.
His most recent missing.

639
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

640
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,450
That I,
I think he might've said that she's

641
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,700
probably dead now for that guy.
He said she's dead.

642
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,570
Yeah,
I think,

643
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,660
but I would just any girl listening,
if anyone says we should go on our

644
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,640
senior trip or maybe go to Aruba,
uh,

645
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,980
there's other areas you could go.

646
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,370
So weird man,
but that is something that girls have to

647
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:34,950
really worry about.
They have to worry about being killed by

648
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:36,870
a guy like that's a,
that's a,

649
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,840
that's a possibility.
It's a rare possibility.

650
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,870
But out of the 300 million people in
this country,

651
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:45,510
that's a big number.
Every now and then one or two is going

652
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:47,670
to pop up and God damn is it
heartbreaking.

653
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,710
Some fucking person who's attracted to
the opposite sex but doesn't get what he

654
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:57,711
wants so often and it's so psychopathic
that he becomes angry at women and wants

655
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:01,170
to kill them and they're out there.
They're out there.

656
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,820
Can you shed any city you go to like
Vegas or Cam?

657
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,000
Girls let their guard down and I'll see
maybe because I'm older now and just

658
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,430
about all of them could maybe be a dawn.
Not,

659
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:13,290
not really,
but you look and you see them,

660
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,430
they're drunk and they're.

661
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,970
And they think that bitchy voice that
they have is going to be the protection.

662
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,800
You know what I mean?
Did that kind of.

663
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,920
I'm that drunk chick kind of noise will
examine their boss,

664
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,070
I don't know where you are.
And they're like in an alley in the

665
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,120
middle of Tampa.
You're like,

666
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:31,680
what do you do it?
Especially if they're like little

667
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,210
children too.
It's like,

668
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,980
you know,
you see some girls that are drunk and

669
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,080
Vegas and be like 20 years old and
hammered and you're like,

670
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,820
wow,
that's like a little child.

671
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,030
She's just out there catching deck.
I know I was in a,

672
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,870
you know,
you don't think of them as little

673
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:47,780
children when you're 20,
when you're $20 checks now you see them.

674
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,140
But when you're 40 and you look at 20
year olds,

675
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:50,681
you go,
wow,

676
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:53,650
this is like the like childlike,
you know,

677
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,300
some of those poor girls,
man,

678
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,370
that Shit's going to program their life.
Bad experiences when you're hammered at

679
00:29:59,371 --> 00:30:02,590
20 around animals,
that's a program your light.

680
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:05,110
And it changed the way you behave or
wherever.

681
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,540
You know,
just a few shitty decisions around the

682
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:11,140
wrong people in the wrong crowd and just
changes your opinion.

683
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,360
I saw I've,
wherever I was performing two weeks ago,

684
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,480
the bouncer guys driving back to the
hotel,

685
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,481
there's a big huge dude which some
really drunk like woman.

686
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:27,100
I bet you she was 55 but kind of still
sketched out and she was with another

687
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:30,400
woman and the woman looked at the big
guy and says,

688
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,480
I don't know her.

689
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,630
I have her cell phone.
I'm going to call her first thing in the

690
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:38,680
morning to this big huge guy.
And the guy didn't look at this.

691
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:39,850
Other woman goes,
come on,

692
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:43,450
I'm not going to rape or whatever.
He just looked at or whatever like that.

693
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,660
And then this juncture chick got into
the car and then they drove off and then

694
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,150
that woman got got into the car.
Wow.

695
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,550
You're like,
dude,

696
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,341
what do you do?
I mean,

697
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,500
I think it was a guy picking up a drunk
girl,

698
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,980
but it was Kinda one of those.
I had a moment where I could have stolen

699
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,030
somebody's girlfriend recently if I was
that type of guy.

700
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,650
Stoller.
Well it was,

701
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:06,730
it would've been a cool movie thing.
There's this girl at the gas station and

702
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,930
she's got a tub of aloe about this big
and Vera.

703
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,910
Yeah,
Kinda big thing of ice and she's icing.

704
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,740
The guy has one of those krautrock at
motorcycles and it was about 110 outside

705
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:20,860
and she obviously Burton her leg on the
exhaust,

706
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,590
so now they're,
I think,

707
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,070
you know,
sitting by the gas pumps,

708
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,980
the guys putting all this stuff on all
this aloe.

709
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,110
He's got his leather jacket,
motorcycle.

710
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,890
She looks so pissed like.
But we've all seen pissed off girls

711
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,400
before.
But the look of just any come out even

712
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,970
came out with one of those roses.
Huh?

713
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,220
And she got it and just set it down.
Like if I was like one of those Douche

714
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:44,690
bag you guys,
all they would have had to done is this

715
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:48,130
stick out my hand.
Like every moving go take my hand and

716
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:51,550
put her in my jeep and drove away.
That guy would have been left right

717
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:53,190
there.
That's ridiculous that you would think

718
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:53,870
that.

719
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,390
Yeah.
Right.

720
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,520
What do you think you are overconfident?
You friendly?

721
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,800
You know,
you're like one of those guys like

722
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,010
watch.
She's going to turn around and look at

723
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:00,844
me.
No,

724
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,640
no.
The deal is

725
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,520
I had a car though.
She doesn't have.

726
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Didn't have to get back on that moment.
Probably when the girl is putting aloe

727
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,490
and ice on the inside of her leg.
Yes.

728
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,700
That's what I mean.
I could have sold a right then you're

729
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,750
delusional.
My hand could have been a very good

730
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,660
relationship and a guy just got a
motorcycle.

731
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,990
Motorcycles.
They had a great time riding together

732
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:33,100
and unfortunately she burned her leg,
but she loves him and she loves being

733
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:36,010
with the look on her.
Just come along and like my hand.

734
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,890
I would have said it way better words
to,

735
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,400
okay,
Lin is not enough movies.

736
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,400
I could trust me and if you want to live
I could have said no,

737
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,710
you need something better than that.

738
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,070
But that would have been the time we
have four wheels.

739
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,940
No,
because look,

740
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:54,730
he just made a mistake and the guy came
back.

741
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,290
He was being nice.
He brought a rose.

742
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,220
It's a nice gesture is obviously a nice
person.

743
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:01,160
He feels bad about it,
of relieved that mistake and you come

744
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:03,170
along and just try to steal your
ridiculous.

745
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,790
It's never gonna.
Relive that mistake.

746
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,750
You might have an Faq of cocaine and
$100.

747
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,250
That would have worked more than than
that shit.

748
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,550
That doesn't work.
It just got off a motorcycle and cocaine

749
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,351
in $100.
She's like,

750
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:17,090
I have a burn on my leg.
I don't want any cocaine.

751
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:19,010
She wants air conditioning and didn't
you know,

752
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,280
pants and not have to ride outside.

753
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,320
Hey,
I got a cartoon to start watching.

754
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:27,380
If you want to show you a little kids
like a cartoon that they can fall in

755
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,270
love with,
but it will be awesome for you.

756
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,720
That fit while being stoned.
It's the best for the double.

757
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,640
A level double level cartoon.
It's called adventure time and it's just

758
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,550
ventured time.
Yeah,

759
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,580
it is the most ridiculous fucking
cartoon I've ever seen in my life and

760
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:46,970
I'm so addicted to it and it's great for
kids.

761
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:50,240
Kids will just fucking sit there and
love it today because it's all about

762
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:54,830
princesses and princes and adventures
with dragons and horses.

763
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,250
But it is trippy as,
what is it on a,

764
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:00,080
it's on cartoon network.
It's on all the time.

765
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,900
Like I,
I just dvr it like a schedule it and I

766
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:04,760
think I got seven yesterday.
So

767
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,710
is it an animation one or.

768
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,930
Yeah,
it's animation.

769
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:11,690
It's kind of put to the same animation
styles that game called Catamari,

770
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:16,340
but it's very simple but very trippy,
like a lot of dragons and swords.

771
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,320
And when you say that it works on both
levels of the,

772
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:22,560
like peewee's playhouse kind of,
but not the new peewee's playhouse?

773
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,530
Yeah,
they have to have it on showtime and

774
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,700
that he,
what he did is he did like a live thing

775
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:29,491
throughout,
you know,

776
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:31,550
like Los Angeles for a while and then he
took it on the road.

777
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:35,210
I think he went to New York and he had
like a live show of the playhouse and

778
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,220
they filmed it for I think showtime or
Hbo.

779
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,380
But I try watching it and it's like
completely a weird.

780
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,850
Now,
is it weird because you know he was

781
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,760
beating off in a movie theater watching?
No,

782
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,370
it's weird because it's like,
it's like he still looks pretty good,

783
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,020
like he still looks pretty much like
peewee,

784
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:53,840
but it's just off a teeny bit where
you're like,

785
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,640
wait,
he has a double Chin now.

786
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:56,474
That's so,
uh.

787
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,290
Oh
yeah.

788
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,330
Right.
He's got this sloppiness to them.

789
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,850
They just kind of.
I don't know.

790
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,580
It's kind of weird.

791
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,340
I would like to see go see kits though.
And it's Kinda the same.

792
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,340
Yeah.
I would like to see the video of peewee

793
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,250
herman getting busted beating off.
Do you know how awesome that would be?

794
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,960
To have the video of him on his tongue
out slow motion.

795
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,830
I'm over and tell him to put his fucking
Dick away and get up.

796
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,740
Why would you?
You would have been even bigger than he

797
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:27,680
was proud of him.
I know,

798
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,840
right?
Well that's the funny thing about that.

799
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,610
A lot of times when things like that
happen,

800
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:34,760
there's a backlash,
but it was sort of like an anti backlash

801
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:36,620
with peewee Herman.
They like liked him more,

802
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,040
you know,
now he

803
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,640
would have made more money if you go in
route and you know why they liked him

804
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,840
more because he's gay.
He's a gay guy that got caught jerking

805
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:48,610
off in public.
This is my theory and he was he a

806
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,610
straight guy that got caught jerking off
in public.

807
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:52,890
It might be a little more creepy because
it's a gay guy,

808
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,790
like poor little fella got nowhere to
beat off.

809
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,770
It can't be open about it and he's got
to go watch string people.

810
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,420
Fuck and concentrate on the Dicks,
you know,

811
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,700
can't even go to a gay place because
he's famous.

812
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,150
Well,
when that happened though,

813
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:09,640
didn't he lose his show and actually
knocked him,

814
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,320
you know,
he was really popular.

815
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:14,740
That happened and then people took,
took them off to shell lake.

816
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:17,260
So we kind of lost it.
I might not know what the fuck I'm

817
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,390
talking about.
I'm talking about what happened in the

818
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:20,530
court of public opinion

819
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,230
maybe in the financial world that
devastated him.

820
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,640
I don't know what the court of public
opinion.

821
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,090
I felt like he did better.
I don't know what other shows.

822
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,620
Did he have a show still?
Because it was not that.

823
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:32,760
It was a long ass time ago that when was
the last movie?

824
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,260
House was on.
He had the two movies that came after

825
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,401
that.
Oh,

826
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:39,730
this was probably in the late eighties
where he got arrested.

827
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,530
No,
but like we're at its height of

828
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:46,120
popularity and pee wee's big adventure.
So Papa got rested in the early

829
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,380
nineties.
I remember I went to see peewee's

830
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:55,330
playhouse with my then girlfriend at the
time who was also very silly.

831
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:57,840
She was a silly girl.
She was a good person.

832
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,510
Go see movies with and we were fucking
car riding,

833
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,720
laughing.
I thought it was the funniest thing I'd

834
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,080
ever seen.
I was like,

835
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:07,620
I was a huge peewee Herman Fan,
you know?

836
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,370
It was just so ridiculous.

837
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,300
Large Marge Center.
We do that all the time.

838
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,990
Yeah.
You just have all these random away.

839
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,220
He would like be in love with the girl
and bring her flowers and stuff.

840
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,990
It was so bizarre.
It's like,

841
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,430
God,
what a fun.

842
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,930
Like a fun,
silly.

843
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,450
Do you know?
Do you know our friend Jeff Scott is the

844
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:35,890
number one peewee Herman and personally
I used to remember watching pm magazine,

845
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:37,480
which was a show and I think the
Midwest,

846
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:40,000
I don't even think I would imagine.
And I had it in Detroit.

847
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:40,270
Okay.
Yeah.

848
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,680
Yeah.
And they interviewed him.

849
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,680
I remember watching that episode and
then written.

850
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:45,514
Now we'll just find out.

851
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,990
That was back when,
uh,

852
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,360
uh,
there was a show called.

853
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,760
Kids are people too.
That's incredible.

854
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,900
That's incredible.
You remember?

855
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,810
That's incredible.
What was the other ones came on right

856
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:57,180
before the right.
I was always a real no real people.

857
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,460
That was the original youtube.
It was really incredible.

858
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,790
Was the original Youtube think?

859
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,590
I love that.
Remember the old Ed Mcmahon,

860
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,440
a peep practical joke show that used to
be really big.

861
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,080
Oh yeah.
It was a TV bloopers and practical jokes

862
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,030
and had the cartoons from the game show
with the whammies.

863
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,220
Yeah.
What's that called?

864
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:18,781
No,
whammies.

865
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:19,501
No whammies.
Stop.

866
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,870
Press your luck.
They used to have those whammies.

867
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,381
Yeah.
And that.

868
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:26,100
And for some reason those whammies were
so popular that when that game show was

869
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,090
canceled,
they were like,

870
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:28,710
we're going to use the whammies on this
show now.

871
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,240
It was just like,
was just like,

872
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,040
wow,
you're just using cartoons from a

873
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,470
different games.
Just continued the family tradition.

874
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:35,304
Yeah,
it was.

875
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:35,980
I looked at my

876
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,890
watch real people episode on Youtube
recently and it was all just,

877
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,190
it was all just crazy.
And then we're going to go to Wisconsin

878
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:45,520
when this guy may can jump 5,000 feet
into cheese.

879
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,060
It was like all just random random
stuff.

880
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,150
And if you look at it like it's this
person has every coke can ever make the

881
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,610
all would have their own shows.
Now if you look how crazy these people

882
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,520
and every one of them would have a show
on discovery or an a and e,

883
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:05,110
there'd be a reality show about every
story with the people that Byron Allen

884
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:08,290
was like,
what the fuck is with these pawn shops?

885
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,860
They're all.
It hit the bottom when they were

886
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:15,280
following guys who are driving on
slippery roads.

887
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,960
Yeah.
Ice Road truckers.

888
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,780
Road is slippery.
You did a truck seven years.

889
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:23,920
Nobody's falling in the same fucking
show every week.

890
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,530
The guys on the ice road.
Oh,

891
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,940
was getting slippery.
Yeah,

892
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,850
I mean I thought that was dumb until I
watched one of these auction shows the

893
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:32,350
other day.
No pawn shop.

894
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:34,570
So rather where the dude wasn't even a
pawn shop.

895
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,980
So it was like a bargain sort of a show.
He shows up,

896
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:38,590
a guy's got a sign.
He goes,

897
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,930
how much you want for this sign?
Oh,

898
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:42,420
I'm not looking to sell it.
What if I give you 500 bucks?

899
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,211
No,
no,

900
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:45,850
I don't think that'd be enough.
What if I gave you a thousand bucks?

901
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,960
Well,
now you're making me think.

902
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:47,741
I'm like,
what the fuck?

903
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:51,550
Really?
This is the show with the two brothers

904
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,180
and one guy.
One guy buys it.

905
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,470
I didn't get that far.
I didn't get that far.

906
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:58,840
They were just trying to buy a coca cola
sign from some dudes.

907
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,750
I wanted to punch the screen,
but it's 100 times better than that show

908
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:02,800
on true TV.

909
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,990
The pawn shop show that's completely
fake,

910
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:08,020
but yet everyone
was like,

911
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,500
the only thing in it for the person
watching was you want to find out how it

912
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:12,970
ended.
How did it get resolved?

913
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,090
It's like this,
but it's like the lowest level

914
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:18,820
entertainment ever.
It's guy give you 100 bucks.

915
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,531
No bugs.
No,

916
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:20,980
no.
I'll give you 500 bucks.

917
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:21,551
Well,
no,

918
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:26,320
you're making me think like you're
sitting there with your mouth open,

919
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,130
waiting to see things.
Doing

920
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,670
boom
days.

921
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,480
When the pond pawn shop owners had a amp
and that was all the went down through.

922
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,970
All creeps right in.
They all have an expert.

923
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,431
They're like,
well,

924
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:45,640
luckily I called the expert of 18,
22 bullets.

925
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:48,130
No,
you don't punch punc guys don't have a

926
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:51,490
team of experts.
Most pawn shop guys are kind of creepy,

927
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,324
right?

928
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:58,390
But I've known about pawn shops is pool
hall dudes who always would sell stolen

929
00:40:58,391 --> 00:40:59,620
shit.
The pawn shops.

930
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,630
Yeah.
They don't have a guy going in there

931
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:05,110
showing you trying to sell pool cues to
buy crack and I know I do do it.

932
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:07,780
A housekeeper and they caught the
housekeeper selling shit.

933
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:10,300
The pawn shops,
they found a shit at trace some of them.

934
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,050
One of their things and turned out it
was sold at a certain punch up there

935
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,220
fucking housekeeper.
We're stealing their shit and bringing

936
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:18,570
it to pawnshops.
Oh Shit Dude.

937
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,260
Can you imagine having a pawn shot that
was also a check cashing place and how

938
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,390
much that would be.
It'd be robbed and.

939
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:29,230
Well they give you a cashier so it's
technically actually it'd be the wrong

940
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:32,290
thing.
You will want to check crush in place

941
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,740
there now,
but it's like

942
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,730
it doesn't make sense.
It's just a all for one and I don't have

943
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:38,590
any money.
Look,

944
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,710
my,
my dad does not go to cash checking

945
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,860
places or pawn shops.
So it seems like the people,

946
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:48,200
the clientele,
those two places seem like they would

947
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:51,590
enjoy a place that they can go to do
both if they have to.

948
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,080
I guess that makes sense,
but it doesn't make sense because it's

949
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,120
two totally different things.
Like you're totally broke.

950
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:58,700
You have no money coming in.
So you sell a stolen TV.

951
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,910
Right?
To cash.

952
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,940
Because my time is spent,
I'll give everything in a bar on one.

953
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,200
Didn't you say you got your dad?
Hi once

954
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,920
talking about that?
No,

955
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:17,310
I didn't get them high.
I just saw it was when I had a thing of

956
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,100
weed soda and it tastes like Cola and he
was like,

957
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:23,060
you're already taking a drink.

958
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,340
And I gave him some weed.
Soda.

959
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,470
Do you ever know what happened?
He was having a great time laughing and

960
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:32,300
telling funny stories and giggling.
It was,

961
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,290
it was awesome.
Did you tell him you tell him that you

962
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,860
could have a day like this everyday now
because we were drinking wine also.

963
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:40,880
So I,
uh,

964
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,670
I think he just probably thought that.
Wow,

965
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,730
that was something good wine.
Why don't you just tell him that gave

966
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,290
him some weed.
Soda will come on man.

967
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,200
That's great.
Now why do you think that generation?

968
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,060
Why don't you tell him?
Huh?

969
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,400
Why don't you tell Him Dad?
He had a great time because you were,

970
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,100
you drinking weed soda?
Because he has a job and if they knew

971
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,900
the contest you are.
Everyone lives in California.

972
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,230
We'll do a lot of places.
Don't pee test their employees.

973
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,580
I don't think.
I don't think it's a majority to fucking

974
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:10,790
pee.

975
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,720
Test that work at gateway.
Definitely test to work at starbucks.

976
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,450
Not Any starbucks people.
They can't smoke week because I get

977
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,370
tested.
Hold on a second.

978
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,990
Stop it.
Yes.

979
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,910
You're talking about burrows.
Most.

980
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,180
Most major jobs.
You have to pee tests and I do not think

981
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:28,050
you're right.
I do not think you have to pee.

982
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,970
Test.
Hold on.

983
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,350
Just make that up.
I had to pee.

984
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,210
Test twice the work at gateway.
Did you say that about starbucks?

985
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:35,961
No.
Google it.

986
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:38,870
We have google right here.
Starbucks employees.

987
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:40,400
That's incredible.
If it's true,

988
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,250
what if it's true?
I'm going to start going to coffee bean.

989
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,210
Any major company has to do it for
insurance reasons though.

990
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,230
Not really.
Yeah,

991
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:48,611
it's,
it's,

992
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:49,550
it's,
it's a,

993
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,490
it's like a rule,
you know,

994
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:53,324
for,
uh,

995
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,380
for most big companies that their
insurances are so high that they have to

996
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:58,214
do shit like that.

997
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,010
At the starbucks where I worked as a
Barista,

998
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:05,920
there was no drug testing.
No drug testing was ever performed.

999
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,890
Thing is working at it,
it certainly did not do random drug

1000
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:12,910
testing either as far as drug testing.
If you get injured while working.

1001
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:16,960
I do not know what the policy is,
but starbucks is not really a laid back

1002
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:17,794
place to work.

1003
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,723
Um,

1004
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,150
okay.
Well starbucks doesn't.

1005
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,220
But what the fuck kind of places do
though?

1006
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:28,760
When I,
when I worked for Brian saying that

1007
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:31,520
starbucks does to work as a fucking
Burrito

1008
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,920
is a ridiculous thing and you like you
don't say stipe miocic invoke with

1009
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:39,290
starbucks.
What I was talking about is most

1010
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:42,410
companies nowadays do require drug
testings.

1011
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,800
I worked,
I worked at a lot of places.

1012
00:44:45,801 --> 00:44:49,820
Joe Not long ago,
seven years ago I was waiting tables.

1013
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,980
I worked at a lot of companies that drug
tested.

1014
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,550
I had to do it all the time and they got
some terrible news today,

1015
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:57,920
by the way,
fashion Irma's.

1016
00:44:57,921 --> 00:45:01,680
What percentage do you think what
percentage of companies drug tests

1017
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:04,250
they're out of like the last five real
jobs I had,

1018
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:09,030
I probably got drug tested at three of
those five jobs and these are defined

1019
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,320
divine search search by going what?
Fortune 500 because they would have the

1020
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:15,020
money to do it.
That's not.

1021
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:16,670
No,
it's pretty normal for companies that

1022
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,690
drug test outside of California.
It.

1023
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,940
That's all I'm saying is that I wasn't
saying starbucks as starbucks.

1024
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,800
I'm saying companies like starbucks and
things like that.

1025
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,310
Main major companies.
I would.

1026
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,760
Are you ready for reality?
Okay.

1027
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,760
Here it is.
Major Laboratory testing company offered

1028
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:35,460
the cheery news recently that the
percentage of American workers who

1029
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:38,970
tested positive for illegal drugs last
year was the lowest ever.

1030
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,380
So people are testing.
The cheery news is that

1031
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,340
people aren't used to be drug as much
because they're buying shit at waterbed

1032
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:50,260
stores like myself called waterbeds and
company and it was a $20 talking about

1033
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,280
drugs.
$40 investment and people aren't

1034
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:54,530
watching it.
That quote saying that is that he,

1035
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,890
that he's as good news that people
aren't testing positive for drugs.

1036
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,150
What are you talking about?
Waterbeds?

1037
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,110
Uh,
they sell at head shops in Ohio and in

1038
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:05,440
the midwest they don't have head shops
like marijuana store.

1039
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:07,950
So they sell,
like they have companies like waterbed

1040
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:11,330
stores that sell head stuff,
supplies in it.

1041
00:46:11,331 --> 00:46:13,640
There's a place called water beds and
stuff in Ohio.

1042
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,030
Didn't expect anyone else to know.
I was explaining it.

1043
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:18,470
Then you stopped when you were.
I was,

1044
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:22,560
I was just getting to this point anyway.
And they sell for $40.

1045
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:26,880
He so feisty.
Today is your fucking sativa six.

1046
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,650
I got a no,
you need to learn how to handle it.

1047
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,650
But,
but,

1048
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,840
but uh,
they sell this shit that you drink,

1049
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,550
that you drink right before you take a
drug test.

1050
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:38,330
And so what you're pretty much doing is
you're pissing out this shit that's kind

1051
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:41,630
of like they just did a big thing in.

1052
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,450
Can't answer this question.
I'm answering this question.

1053
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:46,970
What percentage of companies drug test
their employees.

1054
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,610
I pumped this into Google.
Give me an answer,

1055
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,090
bitch.
It's funny how long Google questions.

1056
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:55,630
How now when you first came out,
you pick up two words like drug testing.

1057
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:56,441
Go,
screw it.

1058
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,350
I'm just going to write an entire
paragraph from see what happened.

1059
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,380
But in Florida they had,
um,

1060
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,330
the,
they tested everybody on welfare and uh,

1061
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,290
you know,
like that's a big thing is you have to

1062
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,420
get tested drug tested before you get
the welfare check.

1063
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,950
Ninety eight percent passed.

1064
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,840
Whoa.
Hold on a second.

1065
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:15,841
Listen to this shit.
And six survey by the Society for human

1066
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:21,631
resource management found that 84
percent of employers required new hires

1067
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,140
to hirees to pass drug screenings.

1068
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,460
Sad.
He's been in California long,

1069
00:47:29,461 --> 00:47:31,990
just 39 percent random

1070
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,600
early testing employees after they were
hired.

1071
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,900
Holy Shit.
In addition,

1072
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:42,901
73 percent tested workers when drug use
was suspected and 58 percent required

1073
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:47,320
testing after accidents on the job.
Whoa.

1074
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,360
What the fuck,
man,

1075
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,540
that's a lot of new hires that you do
trouble.

1076
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,580
That is a horrible thing,
man.

1077
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,790
Eighty four percent of employers were
crying.

1078
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,570
We're crying paper to take drug tests.
Wow,

1079
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,080
that's incredible.
That's so discriminatory.

1080
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,900
You know,
especially for things that stay in your

1081
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:10,240
system but aren't as damaging.
Like we'd.

1082
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,390
Whereas cocaine is out of your system.
You take it on a Friday,

1083
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,610
you'll,
you'll pass a drug test on a Monday.

1084
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,490
It's a quick thing,
it gets out of your system quick unless

1085
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:20,830
I think they test your hair.
I think if they test your hair,

1086
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,000
they can find it a little longer

1087
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,780
and at the waterbed store they have a
shampoo that you put on their hair if

1088
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:26,550
they do test your hair and that's
really.

1089
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,100
It's crazy that this water pet store in
Columbus,

1090
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:32,990
Ohio,
still in business and waterbed,

1091
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,290
not waterbed and stuff.
I love that store.

1092
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,930
I love water beds and stuff.
You got to go do it.

1093
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:41,170
Next time you're in Ohio,
I don't think I do pass on that stupid

1094
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,630
fucking store.
They have shipper.

1095
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,670
Every drug test.
Your waterbed would actually smelled

1096
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,170
like bong water and be kind of crappy to
sleep or the water.

1097
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,110
The worst thing ever is you have a
waterbed and the power goes out and then

1098
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:55,810
waterbeds not hot anymore and it fucking
polls heat off your body like you don't

1099
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,390
realize.
It's actually kind of dangerous man.

1100
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,340
Like you don't want to have a black and
white,

1101
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,720
furry a bedspread.
Think everybody who I've ever met that

1102
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:06,700
had a lot of my probably done at one
point in time.

1103
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,850
It was a good waterbed though,
but they suck for fucking.

1104
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:14,330
My cat popped mine while we were fucking
and fucking look at book,

1105
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,620
but what happened is we both woke up at
the same time,

1106
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,300
but you said we're not.
Me and my cat were fucking.

1107
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,650
No,
I wasn't finding the cat,

1108
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,440
but the cat popped it while I was
fucking a girl.

1109
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,010
It was like something like tweet.
There was so I didn't know it was the

1110
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:40,290
second I'm is
trying to bring you back to reality

1111
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,880
wasn't the waterbed.
Ips was just pushing all the pis out.

1112
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,210
Brian,
you need to go to adult.

1113
00:49:48,211 --> 00:49:48,770
Brian.

1114
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,510
That's what you're telling you.
Put it off forever.

1115
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:58,000
I rewatched the last Joey Diaz podcast
last night and that's the funny thing

1116
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:01,210
because when Joey Diaz is going crazy,
you kept on going,

1117
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,730
you need to go to a doctor,
you need to go to a doctor

1118
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,630
like a yelling Dr. crazy doctor need to
talk to somebody.

1119
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,430
I want to go to a doctor to have the
funniest vsd in the video where he was

1120
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:17,320
going,
pushing a cart to target.

1121
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,480
I laughed.
So yeah.

1122
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,560
Mad flavors.
World,

1123
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:22,330
if you will.
I was laughing so hard.

1124
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,140
If you go on Youtube,
is it mad flavor world or mad flavors?

1125
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:27,470
World.
He's mad flavors.

1126
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,304
Road.

1127
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,470
Okay.
Let's find out because people need to

1128
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:31,460
know.
It's so,

1129
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,650
so funny.
She's walking around and talking to

1130
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:35,830
people in target without them knowing
you're going to do it.

1131
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,640
Show Friday.
Mad flavors.

1132
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,210
World.
I don't know why you asking me on the.

1133
00:50:39,211 --> 00:50:43,670
On the air.
May do it on Friday.

1134
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:46,100
I may not make it mad flavors.
World.

1135
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,700
It is on Youtube.
You got to go and check it out because

1136
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:52,190
what joe is doing is he's just doing
these little videos,

1137
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,130
putting them up every now and again.
Didn't do it.

1138
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,450
Yeah,
yeah,

1139
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,121
yeah.
It's awesome.

1140
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:57,980
More content from Joey.
Anything.

1141
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,380
Anything he does is awesome.
You know,

1142
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,810
he's such an enigma,
such an unusual person.

1143
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,510
I've never met anybody that I'll let you
yell at me like Joey,

1144
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
but he's like,
it's all.

1145
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,560
You just weather the storm.
It's like,

1146
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:10,340
you know,
it's not even,

1147
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,690
it's almost like,
not even real.

1148
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,583
Like,
all right joey,

1149
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,910
you still mad at me.
You done.

1150
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,803
You done.
Tell him when he died.

1151
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,920
I watched that video.
You posted

1152
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,450
that video.
Posted what you were doing.

1153
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,440
What?
You're fucking.

1154
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,030
You're fucking
gets crazy mad over a vaporizer will

1155
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:27,860
start screaming.
You fucking pussies.

1156
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,510
Which a vaporizer
to be healthy.

1157
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,710
It's fucking weed.
He'll get mad at you.

1158
00:51:36,711 --> 00:51:39,100
Man.
Was that the guy that you didn't,

1159
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,300
was it a radio show you did?
Were you invited him in?

1160
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:43,160
I saw that color.
The Alex Jones show.

1161
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:44,960
Yeah.
What happened after that?

1162
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,570
But like after that,
when you said the dude was baffled.

1163
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,820
Oh,
stones sat there in a pile of rubble

1164
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,060
until what the fuck happened to his
show?

1165
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,510
I mean,
could you imagine man,

1166
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,810
if you've got to doom or gloom doom and
gloom show and those of you who haven't

1167
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:59,030
seen it,
just google did some dude.

1168
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,660
Dude did a good fellows version of it,
which is fucking hilarious.

1169
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,100
I wish I knew the,
the,

1170
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,470
the um,
the,

1171
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,350
the youtube and look up goodfellas.
Joe Diaz.

1172
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,670
Alex Jones.
I don't know,

1173
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,670
you could find it in any way.
The um,

1174
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,090
the,
what was hilarious about it is houses

1175
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,660
too,
so serious.

1176
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:22,661
It's all doom and gloom and the
government and the CIA has been spotted

1177
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:29,120
in Nicaragua with tons of cocaine and he
just like fuck.

1178
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,150
And to have a guy like joey come in and
just wreck shop,

1179
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,620
just completely ridiculous and going for
the laugh,

1180
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,710
you know,
I thought I had Karen.

1181
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:44,060
My left balls bigger than I write.
I thought I had cancer and to do it in

1182
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:47,660
just this guy's got his fucking empire
of doom and gloom.

1183
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,410
He's got this empire of the fucking end
of the world is here and this is what

1184
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:51,860
he's selling.

1185
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,340
This is entertainment.
And he's my friend and we just walked in

1186
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:58,090
and just gave him silly is this is,
this is,

1187
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,070
here's some ridiculous motherfucker.
Here's a human cartoon.

1188
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,670
We're both high as Brian is.
So Hi,

1189
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,560
Brian is sitting there with little
esther.

1190
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:08,980
They're sitting on the floor watching at
the,

1191
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,390
on the bottom.
I'm like under the desk,

1192
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:14,900
like we'll just sit here and watch it.
They wanted to be inside watching.

1193
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,710
And Brian's filming it and him and
little esther,

1194
00:53:16,711 --> 00:53:20,570
a giggling dude.
That was one of the greatest moments of

1195
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:22,460
my life.
That was one of the funniest things I've

1196
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:23,780
ever seen.
He was alive at the time.

1197
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:24,770
He was doing that?
Yeah.

1198
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,460
Oh,
so we're on the Internet.

1199
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,910
That's how all these videos are over.
And he said there's a dump on.

1200
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:33,000
I know when I did radio dump or.
Oh No.

1201
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,880
So he doesn't have anything dumping when
he's online.

1202
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,580
When he's online.
The online version is uncensored,

1203
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,650
wasn't he?
Wasn't he broadcasting?

1204
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,930
No,
live to like tons of radio.

1205
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:46,800
That's why I told them where he was,
why I was on the first 45 minutes while

1206
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:48,030
I was on.
It was just me and him.

1207
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,040
And then we will.
Okay.

1208
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:52,380
We're going to do this next one.
We're going to live on the internet,

1209
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:54,140
but don't swear if you do,
it's okay.

1210
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,820
But that's what he said.
Say that I hope he's okay.

1211
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:58,620
By the way,
if you've been watching the news about

1212
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:00,810
Austin and all the fires is bad.
Oh,

1213
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:04,410
it's super bad.
Like tons of how I saw Dale Dudley

1214
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,500
posted something on twitter about it,
that it took them like two and a half

1215
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,400
hours to get home and it's scary.
I get a lot of people are losing their

1216
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,570
houses in Austin,
right to wildfires are fucking nuts.

1217
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:16,890
I've been in a few of them now.

1218
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,860
I've been evacuated from my house on
three separate occasions,

1219
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,870
twice in this house,
twice in my other house.

1220
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,150
It's fucking scary as shit.
How do you decide?

1221
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:27,450
Because I just had a conversation with
my wife because we have no exit plan for

1222
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:29,010
zombies.
Earthquake,

1223
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,000
fire,
nothing.

1224
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:30,860
We have nothing.
Now.

1225
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,690
How do you know what to grab?
That's the one thing that you need to

1226
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:34,590
grab anything,
man.

1227
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,610
Grab your fucking kids and then forward
and don't stop thinking about your shit

1228
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:41,220
because it's over man.
You could reaccumulated shit.

1229
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,230
You know you need to get the fuck out.
When you.

1230
00:54:43,231 --> 00:54:45,210
When you get to a situation like that,
you know what you need.

1231
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:48,240
You need your credit cards.
You need your fucking a laptop.

1232
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,670
If you can get it and some clothes for a
few days,

1233
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:54,270
just fucking run because they swarm on
you so fast.

1234
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,370
This is how fast those fucking fires
are.

1235
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,670
Man.
We were in lake t han,

1236
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,680
which is like over an hour north and you
have to take the five past Santa

1237
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:07,020
Clarita,
so I'm on the five up near Santa Clarita

1238
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,730
and the fire is right there.
It's like Razah.

1239
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,510
I'm driving to work.
It's like 10:00 in the morning as I'm

1240
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:13,890
going to work.
It's like right down.

1241
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:14,724
I'm like,
Whoa,

1242
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,150
fuck.
Like this.

1243
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,640
It looks bad.
It looks bad.

1244
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:20,160
I mean it was a big fire.
So I'm at work.

1245
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,580
We're filming fear factor.
We filmed for about three or four hours.

1246
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,970
We get done with the stunt and we see
smoke coming over the mountain.

1247
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:32,150
Now this is over an hour and a half of
driving 70 miles an hour.

1248
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,730
The fire got to where I was and just a
few hours,

1249
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,240
so I leave.
I get on the fucking highway and the

1250
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:43,200
entire way home,
the whole right side of the highway is

1251
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:48,260
ablaze like a horror movie because it's
nighttime and it looks like a scene from

1252
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:51,900
the Hobbit,
like I'm waiting for demons to come

1253
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,720
riding black horses with fiery eyes.

1254
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:58,560
I mean it's fucking terrifying man.
And I tried to take some photos.

1255
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:01,530
I saw we also saw a dead guy there too.
I think it talked about that.

1256
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,890
So I got to get hit by a car.
Mac units actually saw one of the

1257
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,980
producers of fear factor.
He saw the guy's body.

1258
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:09,690
He didn't.
I don't think he actually saw the

1259
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:11,640
impact.
I think he just saw it right after it

1260
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:13,880
happened.
I thought I felt somebody you hit one.

1261
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,010
I still had that vision in my head.
You can't try to want to cross the

1262
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:18,000
highway,
man.

1263
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,540
People can't stop that fast.
You gotta be able to gauge how fast a

1264
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,380
person can stop.
You know,

1265
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:28,270
like a race car can stop 96 feet from
like 100 miles an hour.

1266
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,380
You know,
that's a race car.

1267
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:34,381
That's a lot of fucking a distance man.
Ninety six feet screeching coming

1268
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,610
towards you,
a giant hunk of metal.

1269
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,850
That's if two people are actually paying
attention.

1270
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,960
Texting or something like.
Yeah,

1271
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:42,910
no shit.
You gotta be careful.

1272
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,560
There's people who do tax on the
highway,

1273
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:48,580
which is amazing that I see it a lot now
you see I'm just looking down and just

1274
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,540
Kinda motherfuckers motherfuckers,
you know,

1275
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:56,530
someone that Jon Anik from a at espns
mma live,

1276
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,610
you know that show the van.
Okay.

1277
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:59,110
Yeah.
He always says don't text and drive.

1278
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:01,660
It says at the end of every show.
It's such a good thing to do.

1279
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,100
Just put it in people's heads.
Don't do it like Bob Barker.

1280
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:09,010
I think texts and drives better.
Depends what a fuck.

1281
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,960
But that's an unfortunate.
But Hey,

1282
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,290
Bob Barker is a good guy.
Just trying to make sure there's not any

1283
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:18,490
unwanted puppies.
Trisha little messages.

1284
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,700
Little little.
Uh,

1285
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,640
yeah.
You just gotTa people have little tags.

1286
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,450
Goldie has one.
When I work with my Goldberg,

1287
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:28,210
when it fights over,
it's always over.

1288
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,613
Yes,

1289
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,410
sure.
Do you know who tyler the Creator is

1290
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,430
who?
Tyler.

1291
00:57:32,431 --> 00:57:34,730
The Creator is your wrapper?
Yes.

1292
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,980
He's really young.
He's like 20 years old and uh,

1293
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,660
I've been falling as twitter for a bit
now,

1294
00:57:39,661 --> 00:57:42,560
but I guess he just wants something at
the video movie awards is.

1295
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:45,660
Twitter is pretty funny.
Side Fuck Tyler on twitter.

1296
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:46,950
But uh,
he,

1297
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,420
he's just this little young kid,
but he has those rafts.

1298
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,300
Twitter is called Fuck Tyler.
Yeah.

1299
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,560
And he has this type that right.
You're really weird.

1300
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:56,560
Like it's going to pop up.
I,

1301
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,230
I just,
I'm a big fan.

1302
00:57:58,231 --> 00:57:59,000
I think you might like,
um,

1303
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,190
check out his raps.
He w what's really cool is he's not one

1304
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:05,160
of those guys that come and he's got
545,000 followers.

1305
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:06,900
He's fucking brilliant.
Really.

1306
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,760
I love the students.
I love this guy.

1307
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,470
Damn.
How do I not know about this guy?

1308
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,020
He's like,
what he's called like horror rap is what

1309
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:15,240
he gets tagged as with horror.
Horror.

1310
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,730
Horror monsters are heart.
Yeah.

1311
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,770
One note kind of like,
I guess scary rap.

1312
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:23,070
Like I saw one of his videos were like,
everyone's has guns in her hands and

1313
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:23,940
stuff.
Kind of like maybe like,

1314
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,220
like a new version of Nwa,
you know,

1315
00:58:26,221 --> 00:58:29,340
kind of like a scarface.
Remember when scarface and Geto boys

1316
00:58:29,341 --> 00:58:30,840
were,
they were considered horror.

1317
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,340
Kind of like,
I've never heard the tester wrap,

1318
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,330
I guess horror,
horror.

1319
00:58:36,331 --> 00:58:37,080
Romp.
Yeah.

1320
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,760
Remember the Geto boys was out there
kind of like,

1321
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,910
you kind of believed that they were like
a gang almost,

1322
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:44,460
you know,
and every fucking bullets in their eyes

1323
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:46,440
coming out of sockets and tried to kill
himself,

1324
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:47,610
didn't he?
I don't remember.

1325
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,080
I thought he got shot in the eye or
something.

1326
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,240
I don't know.
I think he didn't.

1327
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:53,550
He what happened?
I don't know what happened to that guy.

1328
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,260
I'm going to.
I'm just sort of trying to think of the

1329
00:58:55,261 --> 00:58:56,340
horror rap,
but there's a,

1330
00:58:56,341 --> 00:58:57,190
there's a sweet 16

1331
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:58,500
killed them.
Tried to kill himself.

1332
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,290
I think he was high on everclear and Cho
shot himself in the face.

1333
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,770
There's a really cool video that,
that you need to see if tyler,

1334
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:06,390
the creator,
it's called Yonkers,

1335
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,590
need to know the answer to that Bushwick
bill shot himself,

1336
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,620
but you got yonkers Joe.
See that guy.

1337
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,240
That is not going to be saying that
because I'm a.

1338
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,113
I'm a fan.

1339
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,100
You know what sucks about liking people
like tyler,

1340
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,230
the creator though is like they have a
live show in la,

1341
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:27,430
but I'd be too scared to go there.
I got.

1342
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,470
I got beat up by all of you guys because
I feel like a hanging around with black

1343
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:33,100
eyes.
Well I can't.

1344
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,480
I believe that the,
probably the majority of the people that

1345
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:37,640
like them are probably like,
you know,

1346
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:40,000
like a little bit rougher than me.
They,

1347
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,140
they would see me and tried to rape me
or something.

1348
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:47,000
I was at Curtis blow new edition wizards
everywhere.

1349
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:52,001
Utfo concert in Detroit to when I was 16
and we got beat up really?

1350
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,340
Okay in 1991 in Bushwick.
Bill,

1351
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:59,420
either in a suicidal funk or a drunken
rage or as a scheme to have his mother

1352
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:02,470
collect on his insurance policy.
Uh,

1353
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:06,080
he began goating is 17 year old
girlfriend and shooting him.

1354
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,500
Wow.
Reports say he had threatened to harm

1355
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:12,590
the child they had together if she
refused to go through with the deed

1356
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,400
would actually transpired.
Has never been divulged by either party

1357
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:19,790
involved,
but either his or her hand by either his

1358
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:22,220
or her hand build.
Caught a slug in his right eye.

1359
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,460
Whoa,
shoot me.

1360
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,220
We're going to make some money.
And insurance policy.

1361
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:33,080
Holy Shit to a sex tape was before that.
Wow.

1362
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:37,280
But he had already had like a bunch of.
Didn't they have like hit songs already?

1363
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:42,550
Who could he not do shows or something
like where's this money going?

1364
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:47,150
I needed money that badly.
You it to get shot for insurance money.

1365
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,100
I mean they were famous.
I didn't really think.

1366
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:50,630
Yeah,
you really didn't think that through.

1367
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,610
And by the way,
I don't think,

1368
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:53,640
uh,
the,

1369
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,380
the first sex tape I think was that dude
from Hogan's heroes do it.

1370
01:00:57,381 --> 01:01:00,530
I'll always be a Bushwick bill fan from
that song.

1371
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,300
Fuck a war.
You know that song?

1372
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,070
The only play that on the podcast once.
Yeah.

1373
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,250
It's a great fucking jam.
Bushwick bills.

1374
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:10,430
Fuck a war is just,
just for that alone.

1375
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,600
The dude gets my respect forever.
He can go shoot himself.

1376
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:15,434
Go ahead.

1377
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,080
So did you ever one of those Coca Cola
that were popular,

1378
01:01:19,081 --> 01:01:23,070
that Jersey Jersey cocacola shirts that
were really popular?

1379
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,500
I don't know what you're talking about.
Do you notice your.

1380
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:25,440
I don't.
Jersey.

1381
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,180
Did they sell it at chess king?
No.

1382
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:29,400
No.
Maybe that was wholly country.

1383
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:32,250
They used to have these jerseys that
just had like the stripe across it.

1384
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:35,250
They said Coca Cola and it was a stripe
on the arms and the striking.

1385
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,860
I don't know what you're talking about.
Like hockey,

1386
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,260
Jersey or basketball?
No,

1387
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:41,970
Not Jersey.
Like Sports Jersey.

1388
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,990
Like polo shirts kind of remembered.
That was a phase where people wore a lot

1389
01:01:45,991 --> 01:01:46,240
of.
Yeah,

1390
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,480
like Coca Cola just started making
clothes.

1391
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,340
How you would actually let become
popular.

1392
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,290
I think there's someone knocking on the
door.

1393
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,570
Was that someone not going to donate?
What do you.

1394
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:59,910
What Patrick?
Is that Joey know that you heard that

1395
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:00,744
right?
Yeah.

1396
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,210
Maybe he's knocking on the front girl
from door knocking up a girl and just

1397
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:07,410
ask if someone's talking in the front
door.

1398
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,540
Joey Diaz is on his way over here.
Ladies and gentlemen.

1399
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,390
Is it?
Oh,

1400
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,860
is that.
That window is outside the door.

1401
01:02:13,861 --> 01:02:14,760
Hold on folks.
Oh,

1402
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,110
Jesus Christ.

1403
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,330
Did you know they're making a sequel to
knocked up?

1404
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:20,340
Hey John,

1405
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,320
did you know that they're making a
secret that knocked up?

1406
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:23,983
No,
I didn't.

1407
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,340
Sorry about that guys.
We were trying to figure out where you

1408
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,550
are now.
A burglar how to jump the fence.

1409
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,460
Joey Diaz.
This now just walked into the building.

1410
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,940
We're high as fuck and fucking
headphones on.

1411
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:37,530
We had no idea where that noise was
coming from.

1412
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:38,580
You.
We're not going to do what we were

1413
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:39,510
looking.
I don't want to call.

1414
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:41,430
It was a waste of time.
What's happening?

1415
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,293
Hey,
hold on.

1416
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,020
So just to cover what we're talking
about,

1417
01:02:46,021 --> 01:02:51,021
Brian was hypnotizing us with some story
about jerseys were you wore Coca Cola

1418
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:54,420
Jersey Hook a cooler shirts in the
eighties that were really popular.

1419
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:56,730
That was like kind of like a polo shirt.
A red shirt.

1420
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,151
Yeah,
yeah,

1421
01:02:57,151 --> 01:02:58,150
yeah.
I remember the red shirt.

1422
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,130
Yeah.
You guys remember?

1423
01:02:59,131 --> 01:03:01,920
We have no idea.
They have no idea what I don't know

1424
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:02,880
about the hypnotize.

1425
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,580
I was never hypnotized by it.
Now I know the show you're talking about

1426
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:09,390
the Rick Coca Cola hypnotized by his
story because it was so ridiculous.

1427
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:10,250
I was like,
no,

1428
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,560
it's crazy.
I walked in.

1429
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,150
I'm glad you're here to defend him.
Otherwise,

1430
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:17,430
really good attack.
We were just mounting up or attack right

1431
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:19,410
now.
Motherfucker.

1432
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:25,150
What's Joe Diaz in the fucking house
pitches Malibu and got hit in the

1433
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,230
fucking leg.
This rock,

1434
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,970
those eight foot waves.
Oh,

1435
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,050
bring them in fucking rocks though.
Yeah,

1436
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,140
that thing knocked me over.
I mean it was.

1437
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,000
I was.
My foot was on the Rock and a rock

1438
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:37,830
squished my flux and fung Geico.

1439
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,330
My uncle lives on the Jersey shore and
um,

1440
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,600
he got a.
He made a video of waves fucking up the

1441
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:49,460
Jersey shore.
Like how bad a irene crushed everything.

1442
01:03:49,461 --> 01:03:51,470
Holy Fuck.
It's nuts.

1443
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,620
It's Newark is really bad.
Middle New Jersey is fucking bad,

1444
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:55,820
man.
It's crazy.

1445
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,580
Vermont got fucked up.
Vermont.

1446
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:02,150
You know what the really crazy thing was
looking at the satellite image of how

1447
01:04:02,151 --> 01:04:05,720
big the hurricane was when they talked
about it was going to take two days to

1448
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:08,810
reach Vermont from Florida and North
Carolina.

1449
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,100
I remember looking at the picture,
I'm like,

1450
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:13,880
that is that what the.
The scale tree,

1451
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,390
that's a country of a storm flying
overhead.

1452
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,900
It looked like bigger than most European
kind.

1453
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,650
Like bigger than Germany or something
like that.

1454
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:23,600
You know,
like what's a small European country?

1455
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:26,060
It was way bigger than that.
It was huge.

1456
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,560
Some of those countries in,
in,

1457
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:28,643
in,
in,

1458
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,670
in Europe,
very small and very close to each other.

1459
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,140
You know,
these fucking,

1460
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:34,370
this,
this,

1461
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,860
this hurricane was bigger than a couple
of countries.

1462
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,440
It's fucking nuts,
man.

1463
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,220
It ain't no,
but I think we'll get one this year.

1464
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,270
That'll damage at least one.
Is that the biggest one of all time now

1465
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:48,770
on that side of the country,
what's the biggest one of all times,

1466
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,020
Gloria,
because I remember when I was a kid,

1467
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,840
Hurricane Gloria hit.
I don't remember.

1468
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,260
Katrina wouldn't be the.
The biggest one was the one of the most

1469
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:59,540
devastating,
but that was also because we're it hit

1470
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,090
it hit New Orleans,
which is really crazy that no,

1471
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,070
no big ones ever hit New Orleans before
and it's running a fucking.

1472
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,230
You just got lucky.
It's like you talk about like living

1473
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,830
anywhere tornadoes hit.
It's just like totally like playing

1474
01:05:12,831 --> 01:05:15,740
craps.
One day this guy becomes an angry

1475
01:05:15,741 --> 01:05:17,770
monster and destroy an town.

1476
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,110
You see those pictures they had in
Tuscaloosa,

1477
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:24,330
Alabama on fucking believe in Joplin.
The whole place is gone.

1478
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,080
God Don,
that's Joplin,

1479
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:26,891
Missouri.
Yeah.

1480
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:29,620
They always get fucking whack,
bro.

1481
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,730
They get whacked,
hard,

1482
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,700
crazy,
crazy man that people choose to stay in

1483
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:36,940
places like that where they can
economically.

1484
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,260
Yeah,
I mean there's no quick in the east

1485
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:38,910
coast,
not.

1486
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:41,320
We're not safe anywhere where you are in
tornado alley,

1487
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:44,170
earthquake or hurricane alley.
That's true.

1488
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,140
That's true.
You know,

1489
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,930
I was,
I was at Malibu area that I'm looking at

1490
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:49,840
these waves and I'm looking at the
intensity and for one second I thought

1491
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:53,030
about what if there is a fucking tsunami
and malleable.

1492
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,770
What if I was sitting there going,
what if a little fucking earthquake.

1493
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,770
That's a wild ocean out there and the
ocean is just wild.

1494
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,210
It's,
it's the blood of the earth,

1495
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,160
you know,
it's 60 percent or whatever.

1496
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:07,900
The fucking coverage is more than 70.
Baffles the fuck out of me since I was a

1497
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:09,250
kid,
so I don't fuck with it.

1498
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:14,980
Almost drying in coney island and almost
drowned as a kid in coney island and I

1499
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:15,880
was out there,
you know,

1500
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:18,760
up to your waist,
playing with a ball and all of a sudden

1501
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,560
you know,
something just sucks you in,

1502
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,830
you don't know what.
And next thing you know,

1503
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:27,220
you're in a fucking toe and you know
what man or what do they call him?

1504
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,610
Mr. But yeah,
undertow or riptide?

1505
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,960
No.
Undertaking a rip tide or under both of

1506
01:06:32,961 --> 01:06:33,580
them.
The same.

1507
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,370
I don't mind pools and shit.
I know people pissing them and shit,

1508
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,740
but the folk that oceans are different
items,

1509
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,640
you know,
I didn't even know.

1510
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:41,110
Look,
I got clocked by a rock.

1511
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,480
That's a creepy feeling too.
When you feel the undertow or the

1512
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:44,470
riptide,
whatever the fuck it is.

1513
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:45,400
Pulling you back.
Yeah.

1514
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:48,370
We used to go to the ocean trying to
pull you into it.

1515
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,820
Remember you look back and see your mom
finally,

1516
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:55,580
like,
get the fuck in and you're like my wife

1517
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,330
and it's sucking you in and I'll send
you.

1518
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:01,430
Just go from five feet to 15 feet and
now you're caught in that fucking a.

1519
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,900
it's a very,
uh,

1520
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:06,090
scary actually when you're being pulled,
swim,

1521
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,120
don't fight it,
you know,

1522
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,120
grateful and save somebody.
Some girl,

1523
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:13,480
he was on vacation and Greg Fitzsimmons
is not like the most fit guy.

1524
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:16,540
He's a small dude.
And he said some girl got pulled away by

1525
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:17,160
the,
by the,

1526
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,240
the time.
And she started screaming and he

1527
01:07:19,241 --> 01:07:20,800
realized she couldn't swim very well and
he went,

1528
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,840
oh fuck.
And he had a moment to decide what to

1529
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:23,740
do.
And he jumped in.

1530
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:25,710
Oh,
she didn't.

1531
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:28,630
When he was there with his family.
You got to be careful about that man,

1532
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,530
because you know what happens.

1533
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,350
People drown you if you don't really
know how to rescue someone,

1534
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,960
grab a hold of them.
They panic and they drag you under.

1535
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,540
That's fucking dangerous shit,
man.

1536
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:39,550
Rescuing someone.
It's very hard to do.

1537
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,440
You gotta really know what the fuck
you're doing.

1538
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:44,090
That's about the ocean.
The first time I moved to California,

1539
01:07:44,091 --> 01:07:47,290
I went wake boarding.
We went out in the thing and a huge way,

1540
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,360
but I missed it.
I didn't know to go under,

1541
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,010
I didn't know that shit.
The board under in pop up,

1542
01:07:52,011 --> 01:07:57,011
so I rode so it took me nine feet in the
air and threw me backwards and then pin

1543
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:58,810
me and ever since then I haven't done it
again.

1544
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:02,620
We are too afraid to like,
cause I just got my ass kicked so bad

1545
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,000
that one particular time.
I'm like,

1546
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:05,600
man,
I'm gonna hear from the land.

1547
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:09,550
The rivers up there
fucking mosquitoes.

1548
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,370
It's the worst thing you run into.
Got a pontoon boat.

1549
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:16,640
Somebody that's a different fucking he
mosquitoes

1550
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,860
on the leg.
They're pretty bad.

1551
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,850
They,
they'll pick you the fuck up man.

1552
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,240
Pick you to fuck up and put you
somewhere else.

1553
01:08:23,241 --> 01:08:25,460
They got those blanket.
Just Rub Bacon.

1554
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:26,294
Milk

1555
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,460
water on the east coast.
I used to,

1556
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,070
there was A.
Charles River was near my house in the

1557
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:34,510
east coast and I went into the bushes
one time with this chick and we're

1558
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,200
fucking around and we had her pants
down.

1559
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:39,230
We had to stop because we're getting
bits so bad.

1560
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,050
It's like our legs were just covered
with welts.

1561
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,830
The mosquitoes just swarmed on you.
They smell all that pink,

1562
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:49,460
17 year old flesh.
I just dove on us.

1563
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:50,450
It started fucking.
I was like,

1564
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,150
it was brutal.
I remember the next day all my legs

1565
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:57,300
covered in little tiny scabs.
He just got attacked by a swarm.

1566
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:00,230
I still remember some of the worst
nights when that one mosquito would get

1567
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:02,540
into your bedroom and your dad didn't
put on the air,

1568
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:06,530
so it was probably your sleeping and 85
year old weather and you just hear the

1569
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:11,531
one fucking step one and you can
Rudel I rented a house once and nobody

1570
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:16,710
had lived in the house for a couple of
years and uh,

1571
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,560
they had left all the water in the pool.

1572
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,220
So I got there and the pool was fucking
green man.

1573
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:26,960
I mean green like pea soup.
And I looked in it and I see like these

1574
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:30,140
schools and I go,
what the fuck is that?

1575
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,110
Schools have these little tiny bugs
swimming.

1576
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,420
I'm talking hundreds of thousands,
hundreds of thousands,

1577
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:38,540
20.
When the guy goes,

1578
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:39,770
oh shit,
I go,

1579
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:40,160
why?
He goes,

1580
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,270
those are mosquito larva are going to
look what?

1581
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,250
What?
We had a problem.

1582
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,740
I go with you,
so when is this going to hatch?

1583
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:49,880
It goes,
this could hatch any day.

1584
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:51,950
Now I'm like,
Holy Shit.

1585
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:55,640
So this has just been providing
mosquitoes to the entire community for

1586
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,460
years.
This big pool of mosquitoes,

1587
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:01,070
man.
So this guy had a pump gallons and

1588
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:05,900
gallons and gallons of poisoning.
It took like two weeks to clean that

1589
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,170
fucking thing out.
He had to pump the filter and pump all

1590
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:12,070
the chlorine and gallons and gallons of
Korean.

1591
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:16,130
Then drain all the water out because it
was too poisonous and put new water in

1592
01:10:16,131 --> 01:10:20,180
it it because you couldn't just drain it
and you have all these fucking bugs

1593
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,860
floating around in the water.
I'm talking literally hundreds of pounds

1594
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:27,140
of mosquitoes.
It was crazy.

1595
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:27,811
No,
it's crazy.

1596
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:32,190
We're not all fucking as old as I am,
but what about having to off that shit?

1597
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,860
Don't work no more.
Somebody told me about six years ago I

1598
01:10:34,861 --> 01:10:37,710
went somewhere and they don't work no
more brothers and for eighties

1599
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:41,810
mosquitoes,
David Galligan the back routes.

1600
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:44,600
Now they don't even push you off.
All fucking come.

1601
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:46,500
Remember when we were kids,
you could like the thing,

1602
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:51,360
you don't like the thing and then you
can hang out and I miss citronella

1603
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:52,460
candle.
No,

1604
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:56,100
the one made by all off was a wave.
It was a circle,

1605
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:58,230
so when it burned at the end,
you knew you had to go in.

1606
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:01,110
That's when you got to go in.
Now those mosquitoes,

1607
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:03,930
that's like nothing.
They're like fucking off.

1608
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,430
You're going to put off on you.
They don't even advertise it no more.

1609
01:11:06,431 --> 01:11:09,320
I think about it.
What happened off dot these mosquitoes.

1610
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,500
Those don't even respect off no more.
It's like off.

1611
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,830
That's old bitch.

1612
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:21,110
Don't go out until you got you got it.
Smells like nobody uses off no more.

1613
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,970
It's still there because I checked it.
Just people know that shit.

1614
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:25,650
Don't worry.
That'll even if it doesn't work,

1615
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:28,860
it's probably poisonous.
You pour in your pouring something on

1616
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:31,310
your body that makes you unattractive.
We use the spray.

1617
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:36,990
Probably not good for you to fucking
little skin is the biggest organ in your

1618
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:41,380
body when you're spraying stuff.
Says the man with tattoos all over his

1619
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,980
fucking talking about.
I got increments.

1620
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,620
Kin,
but spraying anything on your skin like

1621
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,140
Alexi,
even sunscreen is going to be absorbed.

1622
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:50,460
Those chemicals are going to be
absorbed.

1623
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:53,670
It's used to run behind the.
There used to be a truck that is a

1624
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:54,370
little bit older.
Me,

1625
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:57,210
the truck would drive down the street
with just poison.

1626
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,420
Shoot it into there to kill all.
Oh yeah.

1627
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:05,190
I guess like maybe our grandparents,
but the kids used to follow it like an

1628
01:12:05,191 --> 01:12:07,810
ice cream truck and just run down the
street behind the smoke.

1629
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,070
That's what I do.
There's some guys in my neighborhood,

1630
01:12:11,071 --> 01:12:12,930
I don't know what the deal is,
what they're killing,

1631
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:16,740
but they were walking around the other
day with fucking masks on their face

1632
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:21,480
with these white suits on and they had
these little plastic spray jugs and

1633
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:23,190
they're spraying this shit on the side
of the road.

1634
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:25,980
I'm like,
what the fuck could you be spraying in

1635
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:29,370
the road that I want you to spray on the
road while you're wearing a gas mask?

1636
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,590
You know,
do you have just an excess amount of

1637
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:35,140
this shit need to kill weeds?
Was somebody getting hayfever?

1638
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,030
You know,
come on man.

1639
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,440
I mean,
you want to hire somebody to cut it

1640
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:38,700
down,
then you're making new jobs,

1641
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:41,520
but spraying poison on the side of the
road.

1642
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:45,210
Is that really necessarily with who the
fuck says okay to that?

1643
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,390
Isn't there laws against that shit?
What are they doing?

1644
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:52,050
You couldn't be bugs much and if they
have to still do it,

1645
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:52,831
they must do.
Well,

1646
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:54,570
I saw them do it,
but what we mean,

1647
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,760
what are they doing?
What are they spraying and spraying for

1648
01:12:56,761 --> 01:13:00,570
weeds?
I think it's mosquitoes scheme side of

1649
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:03,330
the road and read about you.
You right on the side of the road.

1650
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:06,480
I think that in the middle of the night
it used to just a thing.

1651
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:08,430
Right?
I don't know.

1652
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,410
I'd say weeds over bugs.
Weeds.

1653
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,440
I don't think it's bugs.
Yeah.

1654
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:16,590
There's no way.
Don't have it or they don't really kill

1655
01:13:16,591 --> 01:13:18,880
that many bugs because the problem with
killing bugs,

1656
01:13:18,881 --> 01:13:21,060
it's some crazy ecosystem out there,
man.

1657
01:13:21,061 --> 01:13:24,840
There's a whole sort of a cycle too.
And if you squash one thing like

1658
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:27,900
mosquitoes or bugs did,
you might fuck up some other part of the

1659
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:29,130
ecosystem along with it.

1660
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,140
And my kill birds,
you see the guy,

1661
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:34,830
there's a guy who made an entire
ecosystem in his house and that's how he

1662
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:39,831
keeps spiders and flies away from,
I don't know the exact number.

1663
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:44,430
He has hundreds of different bugs
species that eat each other and he has

1664
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,560
perimeters in his house.
It's an entire.

1665
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:49,320
So he leaves a flies but then the
spiders come and make the thing.

1666
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:51,230
But then despite.
Or is it,

1667
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,370
I saw it.
I think he has an entire.

1668
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,100
That's his bug system and they don't.
And he has perimeter set up and they

1669
01:13:57,101 --> 01:13:59,850
don't leave the perimeter.
So by the time you were in his house,

1670
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,000
nothing will look man,
if you look at the animals that eat

1671
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:04,170
other animals,
the thing,

1672
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,690
but he's got it all figured out.
It sounded supposed to be set up.

1673
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,280
So there's a,
there's a,

1674
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,470
I guess if you paid attention to it and
you find out what the prey and what

1675
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:12,010
things eat

1676
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,940
and what they get from everything.
He knows the whole system.

1677
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:17,100
That's fascinating man.
I want to.

1678
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,780
How much effort he has to put into.
It was crazy.

1679
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:22,390
It was like a whole,
like something you'd see at a zoo,

1680
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,270
like that's his life's work.
It's like a hip bone connected to the

1681
01:14:25,271 --> 01:14:27,250
joint bone.
It's like there's something always

1682
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:28,330
fucking doing,
you know,

1683
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,460
somebodies always eating somebody.
Yeah.

1684
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:31,990
That's why I don't have hormones
anymore.

1685
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,180
I had the personas are a pain in the ass
man.

1686
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:35,860
First of all,
you have to clean that tank like every

1687
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:37,960
couple of days because they,
they eat massey.

1688
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,830
It's exciting when they eat the messy,
but they're only exciting when they're

1689
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:42,910
eating,
when they're eating.

1690
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:46,240
It's crazy to watch them and I would
feed them goldfish and they would go on

1691
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:48,970
a rampage.
It was incredible.

1692
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:51,070
It was a goldfish.
You think you're going to some little

1693
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:53,800
kid who's got an idea and you're going
to fly around the.

1694
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:57,150
You know
what?

1695
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,910
I would them.
It traumatized me as a kid.

1696
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:03,080
I used to fish for goldfish.
The goldfish in the New York.

1697
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,870
The weirdest thing because you get to my
luggage and river,

1698
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:07,390
which is murky.
You put them into clean water and they

1699
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,280
died.
What the fuck?

1700
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:11,170
You been living in that shit?
Water for 10 years.

1701
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:13,970
I bring you home,
I'll give you a love of Goldfish in the

1702
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,710
central park.
When I was a kid in central park bench,

1703
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,540
I'm just a little fucking thing or that.
Oh,

1704
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:20,910
there were probably part.
Yeah.

1705
01:15:20,911 --> 01:15:24,240
You probably like the little paddle
boats and central park and you probably

1706
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:27,340
know those are other goldfish.
Goldfish,

1707
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,390
goldfish and go,
you don't want to catch nothing.

1708
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,230
None of that fucking Hudson.
I seen a friend of mine either

1709
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:36,210
eels heart one time on the Hudson.
I bet that motherfucker glowed in the

1710
01:15:36,211 --> 01:15:41,211
dark when I was a kid when I was a kid.
It was funny because Puerto Rican lived

1711
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:45,480
in the bronx and Brooklyn.
It's so weird how the the nationality

1712
01:15:45,481 --> 01:15:49,320
thing goes,
but Puerto Rican big weekend out in the

1713
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,720
old days was to go to Jersey.
If you watch cop land,

1714
01:15:51,721 --> 01:15:54,810
you catch the black people under the
bridge of salons,

1715
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:57,840
given them a ticket and they're like,
that's the last time we'll come over to

1716
01:15:57,841 --> 01:16:00,990
Jersey because that was a big thing.
As bad as people put Jersey,

1717
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:02,640
it's got a little couple of sightseeing
things,

1718
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,000
especially like some people rent the car
to go to Jersey on the weekends.

1719
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,170
How fucking crazy is that?
Puerto Ricans would drive over the

1720
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:13,260
bridge,
got under the Hudson in that disgusting

1721
01:16:13,261 --> 01:16:17,130
murky water.
They will dig up a fucking barbecue pit

1722
01:16:17,131 --> 01:16:21,120
that had been there since 1920 and it
was business as usual.

1723
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,270
You know,
they pull up with a car and Puerto Rican

1724
01:16:23,271 --> 01:16:24,140
is a famous,
you know,

1725
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:25,920
I come out of the car,
tend to a car.

1726
01:16:25,921 --> 01:16:29,040
That's no the thing,
it's the shit that was in the car.

1727
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:30,210
The grill,
the couch,

1728
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,570
the 12 piece and Mumbo fucking band.
I mean,

1729
01:16:33,571 --> 01:16:35,790
they're amazing.
And you go under the Hudson Bridge and

1730
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:39,090
here these people on this disgusting
water is life is.

1731
01:16:39,091 --> 01:16:40,740
They're just making the best of what
they had.

1732
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:43,290
They came from the fucking bronx in the
seventies,

1733
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:45,090
which had nothing.
You know,

1734
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:48,300
they just dug the Bronx river out.
Did you read what they found in?

1735
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,130
No buildings.
Why?

1736
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,600
Like people were throwing buildings and
cars and they're like,

1737
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:54,720
that Nino,
the Hudson,

1738
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:55,260
the,
the,

1739
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,840
all that shit is.
So they have destroyed that.

1740
01:16:57,841 --> 01:16:59,550
The pollution levels.
I watched the show,

1741
01:16:59,551 --> 01:17:02,190
the idea by plastic.
I did not know.

1742
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,800
Do you think it's inevitable that if you
get 7 million people living on an island

1743
01:17:06,801 --> 01:17:09,880
like Manhattan,
that you have to just put it to do when

1744
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:14,660
you just look at any random stall at a
public restroom that's only 10 people

1745
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:17,100
going in and not giving a shit,
you know,

1746
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,680
it's like your animals.
Like,

1747
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:21,290
like no one knows what.
I think guys just getting like a pop

1748
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:21,601
song.
Go.

1749
01:17:21,601 --> 01:17:22,970
I'm just going to piss all over the
place.

1750
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,260
What the fuck is wrong with people
people's last week.

1751
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,600
And Anthony Bourdain?
Yes.

1752
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,360
Beautiful City.
How about the garbage?

1753
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,650
Yeah.
How about the garbage?

1754
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:33,870
They don't pick up garbage can imagine
living your life with garbage out.

1755
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,830
You know what that smells like after a
week or week,

1756
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,090
this fucking weather Japan to Harlem to
play one pocket.

1757
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,250
My uh,
my friend Johnny B and Mount Vernon and

1758
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:46,460
Tommy and this dude won.
We all went to Harlem to play,

1759
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,330
uh,
some pimps,

1760
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:51,170
pimps would be gambling,
playing pool and so they would spend a

1761
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:51,680
lot of money.

1762
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,460
So the word got out,
it was like 125th street in Harlem,

1763
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:58,160
maybe even higher than that.
We got there and there are apparently

1764
01:17:58,161 --> 01:18:02,510
some garbage strike and the garbage was
seven feet to eight feet high for a

1765
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,360
whole block.
I mean a whole block dude.

1766
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:07,700
It was nuts.
People would just step outside and throw

1767
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:10,370
the garbage on a pile and there was a
rat everywhere.

1768
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:14,300
Every rentable,
because there's bags of food,

1769
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:16,190
there's bags of things that rats can
eat.

1770
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:21,110
I'm talking literally a block of eight
foot high piles of garbage.

1771
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,460
It was horrifying,
man.

1772
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,190
My friends worked for hunt chemical and
it went to India.

1773
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:29,330
They all got transferred to India and in
the early nineties they came back and

1774
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:31,830
they were telling me stories about how
they don't kill rats there.

1775
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:36,810
You pull up at night with your car,
you know how you see a raccoon or a

1776
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:37,653
fucking cat.

1777
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,390
It just be wrapped and your garbage.
You have to sit there for 10 minutes and

1778
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:44,330
let them run out of the fucking garbage
before you get out of the car.

1779
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,940
I can't deal with that guy.
He's just going to rap.

1780
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:48,710
They found the bronx.
I know you've seen that.

1781
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:51,870
I saw that fork now and how big the
fucking rat work.

1782
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:53,450
How many were.
They were a mess.

1783
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:55,580
They said there's a lot of them.
The guy looked at me and goes,

1784
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:57,650
he thought it was kids in there.
He thought it was like kids.

1785
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,300
They will fuck.
He pulled them out.

1786
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,980
They were like a cat.
The back legs.

1787
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:04,570
Cat picks his legs up.
He had it like three feet.

1788
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,850
What was the biggest rat I've ever seen
in my life?

1789
01:19:07,851 --> 01:19:10,550
It was fucking enormous.
It's body looked like it was almost two

1790
01:19:10,551 --> 01:19:12,080
feet long.
His body,

1791
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:15,140
his body was clearly more than a foot
long.

1792
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,330
His body easily could have been a foot
and a half,

1793
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,780
maybe even two feet long.
It was a big rat and this guy said

1794
01:19:20,781 --> 01:19:22,580
there's a lot of them there.
You said there was a lot of them.

1795
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:23,600
That whole.
You know,

1796
01:19:23,601 --> 01:19:24,900
it's so weird.
Like I,

1797
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:28,670
I grew up on Adhd for awhile when I came
from Cuba and we would kill rats.

1798
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,551
You know,
you chase her.

1799
01:19:29,551 --> 01:19:31,160
I hit him with a stick.
Light them on fire,

1800
01:19:31,161 --> 01:19:34,520
throw rocks at you,
make sure that motherfucker's dead.

1801
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,190
Then I used to spend my summers on 140th
street.

1802
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,860
My godmother had three buildings so I
could walk underneath.

1803
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:44,150
I seen a rat under that one time that
his eyes was so fucking big.

1804
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:48,170
His eyes are so fucking big that I was
like,

1805
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,090
no,
you know where I've seen a big rap too

1806
01:19:50,091 --> 01:19:53,060
at the La Jolla comedy store.
Fucking condo.

1807
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,940
I've seen a rat in that motherfucker.

1808
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,860
I packed my bags and got back on that
five.

1809
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,360
Oh yeah,
I see the big wrap there.

1810
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,410
I think they're living in the ocean.
God Damn it.

1811
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:05,390
I can't deal with that.
So fucking durable.

1812
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:10,410
They can compress their body and get to
really small holes to like a big rat can

1813
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:13,590
smush his body and get through a fairly
small fucking hall.

1814
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:17,520
It's really kind of crazy to watch.
That's a fuck is you think guys back in

1815
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,780
the day,
like 400,

1816
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:23,570
500 years ago were afraid of rats or
adidas looked at us food like we're

1817
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,440
lucky that we don't have to deal with
the rats,

1818
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,750
but it just mentally like it.
They're afraid and if you go back like

1819
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,650
neanderthal days they were.
They didn't give a fuck about a rat.

1820
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,770
Anything small digression.
I live up in the hills too and I have a

1821
01:20:34,771 --> 01:20:36,690
privacy fence and you'll see them just
running.

1822
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:41,080
My dogs would try to it and then I'll
jump every time I see one and I'm like,

1823
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,420
when you get over that dude,
I used to have them in my.

1824
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,710
I had to bring in exterminators.
I used to have them by Anik.

1825
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,970
You would hear them.
It was like,

1826
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:50,130
like literally like two dogs fighting up
there.

1827
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:53,820
I would hear like they would screech and
squawk at each other sometimes because

1828
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:55,650
they would be mating.
So I'd hear.

1829
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,040
I would hear a scream,
fuck yeah,

1830
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:02,070
in my house.
I hear it in my attic.

1831
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,020
It had hire a guy to come in and kill
them all.

1832
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,360
How?
It was nuts,

1833
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,470
but they weren't that big.
They were regular size,

1834
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,240
but you know they're.
They're fucking right.

1835
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:13,530
Wanting in your ceiling,
running a slamming things and fighting

1836
01:21:13,531 --> 01:21:15,990
over pussy.
They're screaming and fighting over

1837
01:21:15,991 --> 01:21:17,370
posing.
Isn't that weird?

1838
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,570
I don't know if you were there,
how they.

1839
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:21,750
A friend of mine called me once,
how they would do arson in the old days

1840
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:26,910
that we get a cage and put myself and
pour gasoline on the mice and the mice

1841
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:30,950
on fire and pulled the thing and the
mice run into the walls and big.

1842
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:35,060
That's the way the your house on fire to
do that.

1843
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:39,210
Fucking insurance scam and new Rach
would go into the walls and burn the

1844
01:21:39,211 --> 01:21:41,400
wool.
That's the way that you do old adage.

1845
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:45,120
Brilliant.
That's how you do it.

1846
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:51,660
As long as he had enough rats right now,
fucking places going down because while

1847
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:54,150
they're searing,
they're still going in your walls dying.

1848
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,910
So that's starting more fucking things
in your walls.

1849
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,770
I mean,
what gasoline be enough?

1850
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:02,460
It has a really dip 'em in there and you
have to dip them in the old days when

1851
01:22:02,461 --> 01:22:04,100
everybody was in on it.
The fuck.

1852
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,250
Look at Bushwick.
Bill got shot in the fucking head.

1853
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,930
Did he?
You didn't hear about this earlier.

1854
01:22:09,931 --> 01:22:13,170
Bushwick bill.
We were reading a story.

1855
01:22:13,171 --> 01:22:17,430
It's an old story happened in 99.
He told his girlfriend is shoot him in

1856
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:20,940
the head because he wanted to get the
insurance money and they don't know who

1857
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,550
did it,
whether he shot himself in the head or

1858
01:22:23,551 --> 01:22:25,500
she shot him in the head,
but he got shot in the eye,

1859
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,620
so as he alive,
he's alive because somebody send them in

1860
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:29,340
Houston musical.

1861
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:34,010
John Westlink Bush would have been a
long time.

1862
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,853
Okay.
Oh,

1863
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,080
it's.
I think he's on the cover of one of his

1864
01:22:37,081 --> 01:22:38,310
fucking.
We can't be stopped.

1865
01:22:38,311 --> 01:22:40,650
I think the Geto boys with the patch
over his eye.

1866
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,110
Where it shows.
Is Iowa all fucked up where he shot

1867
01:22:43,111 --> 01:22:43,944
himself?
Yeah,

1868
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:44,790
isn't it?
Yeah.

1869
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:46,490
It's on Wendy albums where he's coming
out.

1870
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,850
Would that be to shoot you?
So when you were high on everclear?

1871
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:55,260
Apparently
everclear is like some super powerful

1872
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:56,790
alcohol.
First Time I got pulled over,

1873
01:22:56,791 --> 01:23:01,440
I was on seven shots of everclear and a
copy of his 16.

1874
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,660
Oh Man.
I used to hang out.

1875
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:05,770
I used to work at this movie theater
with all these guys that

1876
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,880
were like 18 or 19 and know would go to
this military base and by everclear.

1877
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,080
And so,
uh,

1878
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,710
they thought it was cool because they
were the ones who first introduced me to

1879
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:16,540
weed and everything.
I have no military,

1880
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,200
no,
no.

1881
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,110
These guys that hang out with these
older guys and so,

1882
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,790
uh,
I would,

1883
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:26,460
they thought it would be funny to like
get me fucked up on it by like a Gimme

1884
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:28,600
shots and I wanted to act like,
oh yeah,

1885
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:30,160
I'm cool.
I can do shots of this.

1886
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:33,340
Not knowing what ever clear was,
I just heard it was like a strong

1887
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,260
alcohol.
What is the percentage of alcohol and

1888
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:39,470
everclear?
I wanted to say it was 127 of them

1889
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,500
proof.
And then they let you drive?

1890
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:43,181
Well,
no,

1891
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:43,991
they,
they,

1892
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,610
uh,
thought I was crashing there,

1893
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:47,130
but I,
I lied to him.

1894
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,970
It's like he got the fucking car bitch,
motherfucker

1895
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,870
with you when he's dressed us all
alleged by the end.

1896
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,720
The coolest thing was though,
is that I got pulled over right down the

1897
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:00,550
street,
like literally like two blocks.

1898
01:24:00,551 --> 01:24:03,130
I got pulled over and the cop goes,
dude,

1899
01:24:03,131 --> 01:24:04,600
you're wasted.
All right.

1900
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,360
Here's the deal.
See this Udl,

1901
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:08,260
which is a like a gas station.
He's like,

1902
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,000
you park your car in there,
you sit there.

1903
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,070
He's like,
I want you to go inside by a cup of

1904
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:13,990
coffee.
I'm coming back and four hours if you're

1905
01:24:13,991 --> 01:24:15,880
not here,
I'm giving you a fucking Dui.

1906
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:16,900
I'm going,
I know where you are.

1907
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,510
And everything like that would have been
sort of.

1908
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:22,960
And really you shouldn't go to jail.
He even gets better.

1909
01:24:22,961 --> 01:24:25,030
He even gets better as I was like,
he's like,

1910
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:26,320
go in there and get a coffee.
And I'm like,

1911
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:27,940
actually I have no money.
And he goes,

1912
01:24:27,941 --> 01:24:30,940
he goes and he gave me money to buy a
cup of coffee.

1913
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,250
And then,
uh,

1914
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,070
so I sat down

1915
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,690
commerce.
There's good cops out there,

1916
01:24:34,691 --> 01:24:37,030
man advaclear in Boulder,
Colorado.

1917
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:39,020
There's a Mexican restaurant.
I don't know if it's still there.

1918
01:24:39,021 --> 01:24:40,610
It's pupusas.
Yo,

1919
01:24:40,611 --> 01:24:43,150
it's on melrose,
melrose,

1920
01:24:43,151 --> 01:24:44,930
on the whatever.
The main pro.

1921
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:46,690
You're in boulder.
Go to pupusas.

1922
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,990
Fucking tremendous.
But the secret of this place was that

1923
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:51,400
Margarita is,
were made whatever.

1924
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:53,620
Clear.
Quantro wow.

1925
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:58,540
So you were only allowed and then they
asked you to fucking leave and go,

1926
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,780
fuck that.
I ain't Queloz three of those and you

1927
01:25:01,781 --> 01:25:02,620
just be like this bro.

1928
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,410
I think El Coyote,
they allowed to do

1929
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:06,930
that.
And last name,

1930
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:10,140
green limit three Margarita limit bitch
at for lunch.

1931
01:25:10,141 --> 01:25:12,900
They had a one margarita limits.
You could have two little ones.

1932
01:25:12,901 --> 01:25:16,980
They had little much for a little
champagne wedding things he does that.

1933
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:19,500
They don't tell you what's in it like
that.

1934
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:23,150
They win all the Margarita contest,
you know that like almost every year and

1935
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,280
they won't tell you what the secret
ingredient is,

1936
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,620
but every time I go there,
if you just get the one on the rocks,

1937
01:25:27,621 --> 01:25:29,540
I'll get to and I feel like I just
fucking did.

1938
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:30,403
Ecstasy something.

1939
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:31,770
Yeah.
We need to film this.

1940
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:34,410
We need to film us going to El Coyote
and having some.

1941
01:25:34,411 --> 01:25:35,370
Marguerite is,
let's do that.

1942
01:25:35,371 --> 01:25:38,760
Boys don't drive.
You don't want the craziest thing.

1943
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,660
We're going to hire someone to drive.
We'll get a little caught.

1944
01:25:42,661 --> 01:25:45,120
One of the craziest things I've Tequila.
Just kidding.

1945
01:25:45,121 --> 01:25:48,590
It depends what mood you're in.
If you drink enough tequila,

1946
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:50,580
bro,
it becomes something different.

1947
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:53,340
Yes.
It becomes a different animal than vodka

1948
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:57,170
or Tequila is a kind of tricky mother.
I don't know if you motherfuckers ever

1949
01:25:57,171 --> 01:25:58,970
rate the warm.
I made a mistake one second,

1950
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:02,400
but swapped and ate a warm Tequila.
Makes me,

1951
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:03,620
uh,
I think,

1952
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,483
yeah,

1953
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,120
there's a difference between Tequila
draw.

1954
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,450
It sounds ridiculous.
It does,

1955
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,650
but it's true.
And Sheila Drunk whiskey drunk.

1956
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:13,490
Whiskey drunk is more like fucking
aggressive Tequila.

1957
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:16,270
Tequila drunk is more like we've got to
find the vampires.

1958
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:19,130
Oh,
I'm angry.

1959
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:22,310
I'm
angry on Tequila man.

1960
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:25,640
But to Jack Daniels is questionable
choice.

1961
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,533
I mean,
you never seen it.

1962
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,250
Never been.
You never seen me angry as a drug

1963
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,200
dealers.
I think a lot of it that you go into.

1964
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:35,060
So if you think I'm an angry drunk and
it was dangerous and you start drinking

1965
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:40,070
because you're weird reaction.
I'm not an angry drunk though.

1966
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,450
I don't believe in that shit entirely.
I feel like if you're an angry person

1967
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:46,250
and you get drunk,
then you become an angry drunk.

1968
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:49,430
If you have some fucking resolved
issues,

1969
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:52,430
then it become an angry drunk because
most of the people are not even ready.

1970
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:52,941
Sing,
angry.

1971
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,050
I guess.
It's just crazy.

1972
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:56,040
Like Tequila makes you a fucking like
Robin.

1973
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,940
You're a silly drunk.
You become silly when you're drunk

1974
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,950
because you're a silly person and it's
for you.

1975
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:03,650
It's you just.
Your inhibitions loosen up and you

1976
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:06,110
become more like.
Like that podcast that we did with burn.

1977
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:09,170
You were fucking hammered and you were
really funny and one of the reasons why

1978
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:11,960
you really funny because you were.
You were giggling and silly because you

1979
01:27:11,961 --> 01:27:15,100
went into lose your inhibitions mode
right now.

1980
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,110
That was Tequila would have had sex with
Bert

1981
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,160
was
crazy.

1982
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:22,771
Like,
well,

1983
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:25,190
let's say I drank a beer.
I've did blow.

1984
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,480
I will go home and just want to fuck.
But when you do Tequila,

1985
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:29,420
do blow,
you get old,

1986
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:32,180
creepy,
really like to put a cape on and you

1987
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:36,760
start looking at a chick thinking about
maybe she could do a somersault and land

1988
01:27:36,761 --> 01:27:37,520
on my face.

1989
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,820
You know,
like you just got spirits in it to kill

1990
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:42,290
this spirit.
Something I get fucking creepy on

1991
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:43,900
Tequila.
Willing be.

1992
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,290
Well,
it's made out of a plant.

1993
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,680
You know,
there's something in your toes.

1994
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,680
Really.
Yeah.

1995
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:52,340
Get it would blow you.
Blow the thing.

1996
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:54,350
Tequila gets.
It becomes a difference.

1997
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:57,650
It's such a fine dance though,
of having too much Tequila where your

1998
01:27:57,651 --> 01:27:59,120
Dick don't work.
It's like,

1999
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:01,820
this is fucking.
You got to get just enough so that

2000
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:05,480
you're crazy,
but you have enough food in you and

2001
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:08,430
you've taken your vitamins so you'd.
Dick still works because if you're like

2002
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:11,960
unhealthy and you get drug off Tequila,
good luck with your Dick.

2003
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:12,980
Good luck.
You just,

2004
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,930
you just put yourself in a great
position.

2005
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:17,390
You got your ready for wild,
crazy times.

2006
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,040
Everyone's game.
Oh,

2007
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,300
we'll look at your deck.
Also.

2008
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:23,170
Sad.
Have you ever had from booze guy from

2009
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,610
booth Redman,
from Bulls you've had?

2010
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:26,860
You haven't,
no,

2011
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:28,720
no,
but you throw that in the powder.

2012
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:32,960
In the old days you dead,
it shrinks into the nut sack.

2013
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:35,990
That is amazing when you want to fuck.
But there ain't nothing there.

2014
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,420
Nothing there.
It's deep,

2015
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:40,010
deep,
deep in the nut sack and they got to

2016
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:42,330
keep sucking and they got a nice Dick.
But

2017
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,680
like they,
it starts off like this,

2018
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:50,270
like they got hold it fucking bottom of
it and then it gets bigger and bigger

2019
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:53,630
and then you think about doing a line.
It goes back in the cocoon with a

2020
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,900
fucking nightmare doing that shit.
You want to eat that?

2021
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:58,070
But then you're like,
okay,

2022
01:28:58,071 --> 01:29:02,070
I'll just eat your pussy like you just
fucking all the I had in my mind.

2023
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,250
Fuck it.
I'll just eat your fucking.

2024
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:06,690
The most embarrassing ones that I've
ever had was when I was drunk and I

2025
01:29:06,691 --> 01:29:09,180
started the fuck and then as I was
fucking,

2026
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:13,320
the alcohol really kicked in and then I
completely lost my boner so it lost it

2027
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:17,590
while I was already having sex.
So it's like for the girl,

2028
01:29:17,591 --> 01:29:20,660
it's like a terrible feeling.
I just puked once dude.

2029
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,740
To have been,
have a hard Dick,

2030
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,550
put it inside you and then in life you
don't even keep them interested enough

2031
01:29:26,551 --> 01:29:29,490
to keep the hard on like,
and then it was just pathetic.

2032
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:34,980
I just felt like I was trying not to act
like you were and then you reach down

2033
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:39,870
buyer to almost like a whisper and I
turned my head and threw up and tried to

2034
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:43,620
like do it like a barf bag where I kinda
kept that contained in my back.

2035
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:47,900
And then she was like,
did you just throw up my computer?

2036
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,050
Yeah,
you tried?

2037
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,210
Yeah.
You ever throw up and you don't give a

2038
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:54,520
fuck.
You fuck that.

2039
01:29:54,521 --> 01:29:56,470
Look the other way.
I'm still going to give you a stabbing.

2040
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,540
She don't give a fuck.
And that smell is.

2041
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:03,050
And you're like,
Oh,

2042
01:30:03,051 --> 01:30:06,230
is that hillary?
And they say to me,

2043
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,850
kiss me.
I'll kiss you full shoot this fucking

2044
01:30:09,851 --> 01:30:13,520
loaded that dead snatch and alcoholic as
Audi.

2045
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:17,140
Dirty fuck.
Because once Johann Johann de,

2046
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:20,290
that's what happens is a fucking date
written on dumping them.

2047
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:23,050
This bitch literally go down.
You know we don't condone it,

2048
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:26,260
but that's what happens that date.
You just got to catch yourself with.

2049
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:30,220
The worst is when some chick pukes in
your car like language Speaker Grill,

2050
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,120
and you want to beat the fuck.
Fuck.

2051
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,300
That's the worse.
Your car smells like Puke.

2052
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:37,690
For 11 months.
I was in my car with a toothpick.

2053
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,420
Picking out each little hole in my
speaker grill.

2054
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,360
Just pulling out red bull.

2055
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:43,370
Yeah.
Well listen man,

2056
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:46,310
I had a girl puke in my car back in the
fucking eighties and they didn't have

2057
01:30:46,311 --> 01:30:47,144
good cleaner.

2058
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:50,450
You couldn't clean the car out.
They didn't have all that good

2059
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,010
stuff back then.
You basically went and used that shitty

2060
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:55,390
ass vacuum would always catch on the
carbon go.

2061
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:00,710
Remember it would catch on the carpet
and you cannot fucking Donald.

2062
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:03,780
I go to the carwash.
You tried to do the entire car with

2063
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:06,450
twenty five cents.
It was like the fastest I've ever moved

2064
01:31:06,451 --> 01:31:07,930
to my town.
You would have to go to one of those

2065
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:10,980
full service car washes and get done the
shampoo your shit,

2066
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:13,260
but you don't want to do that because
those monkeys,

2067
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:16,510
whether shampoo and your shit,
they get fucking suds in your wiring and

2068
01:31:16,511 --> 01:31:18,560
then your fucking car shorts out.
You know,

2069
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:20,220
I didn't want to do that.
I knew those dudes.

2070
01:31:20,221 --> 01:31:22,740
I worked at a car wash.
So when I thought about getting my car

2071
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:23,200
washed,
I'm like,

2072
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,960
I'm not going to bring it to these
fucking guys.

2073
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,480
These guy's gonna.
They let me drive a porsche.

2074
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:29,400
Okay.
I didn't even know how to drive a stick.

2075
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:33,270
I hadn't zero stick knowledge and I got
into fucking Porsche.

2076
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,720
That's how the first car I ever drove
stick was a porsche at a fucking,

2077
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:39,980
at a car wash.
I don't even know what I was doing when

2078
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,470
he told me I go,
how do I drive it?

2079
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:44,860
He goes,
just push the clutch in,

2080
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:47,070
put,
put it in gear and then slowly let your

2081
01:31:47,071 --> 01:31:50,490
foot off the gas.
So I come out of this car washes,

2082
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:54,930
16 year old faced kid driving a porsche,
you know?

2083
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:56,640
And the guy said,
why did you drive it if you didn't know

2084
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:57,391
how to do it?
I'm like,

2085
01:31:57,391 --> 01:31:58,380
why?
They let me drive it.

2086
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,010
I didn't have anything to say to him.
I'm just

2087
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:00,731
like,
I'm sorry.

2088
01:32:00,731 --> 01:32:02,860
They told me to drive it.
The Guy told me I would know how to

2089
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:05,410
drive stick,
stick the thing in gear and it'd be no

2090
01:32:05,411 --> 01:32:07,600
problem.
They didn't give a fuck.

2091
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:12,840
I got busted last week washing my car
and coin Burbank Boulevard.

2092
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:15,000
Brian.
There's a little car wash.

2093
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:16,650
Then I usually go in there and just hit
it.

2094
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:21,120
But I had to fucking pee dog.
I just had a piece while I was washing

2095
01:32:21,121 --> 01:32:22,860
the car.
Nobody was watching you know me bro.

2096
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,300
Out per a phone booth.
I got a really A.

2097
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:28,150
I'll pull over and make believe.
Now nobody has phone booths no more.

2098
01:32:28,151 --> 01:32:29,940
But in the old days I make believe I'm
on the phone.

2099
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:32,780
Take my pick up.
Even as traffic is driving by it,

2100
01:32:32,781 --> 01:32:35,310
they don't think you're pissing.
I'm pissing on the fucking thing.

2101
01:32:35,311 --> 01:32:37,630
You just can't do it in the window.
Can steam comes out there,

2102
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,910
bust you in the fucking winter?
So Damn,

2103
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:42,090
washing my car,
it's 9:15 in the morning,

2104
01:32:42,091 --> 01:32:43,530
I gotTa pee bad and I said,
fuck,

2105
01:32:43,531 --> 01:32:45,690
I'm going to take my dick out ready?
And I took my dick out.

2106
01:32:45,691 --> 01:32:50,310
I'm old and I'm watching the car and I
just went into this fucking thought and

2107
01:32:50,311 --> 01:32:51,880
next thing you know,
I look over and the owner,

2108
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:53,730
the thing was right there.
He was like,

2109
01:32:53,731 --> 01:32:55,080
are you fucking serious?
Like a dog?

2110
01:32:55,081 --> 01:32:57,240
I had to fucking pee and it's going into
a total.

2111
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,480
He was doing me a favor,
put the hose down and get the fuck outta

2112
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,460
here.
He drew me the fuck out.

2113
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,850
He goes,
I'll call the fucking police.

2114
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:06,310
I watched a guy,
I didn't say anything.

2115
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:08,690
He told the guy who comes to my house
and uh,

2116
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,610
it's actually what it's called,
the poop Butler because I travel it,

2117
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:14,240
but he picks up poop basically from your
dog for,

2118
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,740
for my two dogs.
And I didn't clarify that.

2119
01:33:16,741 --> 01:33:17,051
Yeah,
yeah,

2120
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:18,890
yeah.
I know I had,

2121
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:21,060
I paid a service.
Are you serious?

2122
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,410
Yeah,
it's a service.

2123
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:24,060
It's the best thing that I could ever do
because.

2124
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:27,200
Or I'd have five days of shit to pick
up.

2125
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:30,480
So my,
so he was peeing like a big gold thing

2126
01:33:30,481 --> 01:33:31,770
and I'm like,
is that guy peeing?

2127
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,070
And he's a little creepy because they
think he's always steering into try to

2128
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,780
see my wife,
like walk around or something,

2129
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:39,540
who wouldn't?
But I look and I see him with now he's

2130
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:41,940
got a big gold thing that he just pissed
in front of my house.

2131
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:44,970
So I'm watching him because he doesn't
want to move so I can pull in.

2132
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,800
I'm like,
where's it gonna throw that.

2133
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,920
If he throws that into my bushes,
I'm going to be pissed.

2134
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:53,070
Watch to my neighbors and just acts like
he's,

2135
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:55,080
you know,
takes the big gulp,

2136
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:57,970
throws his piss onto my neighbor's yard
and then leave.

2137
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,350
That just happened.
I.

2138
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:00,660
So now I'm like,
well,

2139
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,960
it's such a good service and there's no
other competition.

2140
01:34:03,961 --> 01:34:05,520
So if I,
if I call and say,

2141
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,470
hey,
tell them not to throw piss on my

2142
01:34:07,471 --> 01:34:09,540
neighbor's yard,
that then what happens?

2143
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:12,260
And I got to pick up poop.
So it was a weird sacrifice.

2144
01:34:12,261 --> 01:34:14,490
I'm well,
is this a company where the guy that

2145
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,620
owns the company or is this an employee?
Hold on,

2146
01:34:16,621 --> 01:34:18,630
hold on.
The p thing is just one thing.

2147
01:34:18,631 --> 01:34:21,180
This looking at your wife,
you just glossed over.

2148
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,430
Why don't you tell us a little bit more?
What is.

2149
01:34:23,431 --> 01:34:24,880
What is the reason for that?
Well,

2150
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:25,801
we don't.
Well,

2151
01:34:25,801 --> 01:34:28,590
because if you stare at and he comes
early in the morning,

2152
01:34:28,591 --> 01:34:31,650
you can get a glimpse at 9:00 AM of
maybe her popping up.

2153
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,360
Like why?
Why are you saying that?

2154
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:34,740
Did he do that?
We,

2155
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:38,280
she gets that feeling that he is,
but we've never actually caught.

2156
01:34:38,281 --> 01:34:39,630
She's like,
I think he stares.

2157
01:34:39,631 --> 01:34:40,530
I think he,
you know,

2158
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:42,050
my wife doesn't sound like that once
she.

2159
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:43,920
Why does she think stairs?
No evidence.

2160
01:34:43,921 --> 01:34:46,920
Just a guess.
Just thinking in that you'll see him

2161
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,440
walk by.
So she's like,

2162
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:49,710
was he just stay?
You don't,

2163
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,110
we don't know.
We should maybe just videotape it.

2164
01:34:52,111 --> 01:34:56,100
Wants to set up a camera and see if he
hangs out or if he pisses in my backyard

2165
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,950
yard.
My whole house has cameras.

2166
01:34:57,951 --> 01:34:58,130
I

2167
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:01,980
am alerted whenever somebody enters each
one of my rooms on my iphone,

2168
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,360
somebody crazy bitches,
bro.

2169
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:07,370
You to keep your shit locked out and
black wizards attack me.

2170
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:11,840
Be careful.
Black was it the guy robbed him,

2171
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,810
put a fake ones,
fake beard on like a wizard and he had a

2172
01:35:14,811 --> 01:35:18,780
hood on.
It was like a black wizard say did he

2173
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:22,820
fucking made magic and made your money
disappeared of my flat flashback when

2174
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:26,030
I'm at JC penny's and I see a black
Santa Claus at the mall or something.

2175
01:35:26,031 --> 01:35:28,370
And when was the last time you've ever
seen a black Santa Claus at the mall?

2176
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,230
Bron.
I've.

2177
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:31,140
I've seen black Santa clauses.
He never seen black.

2178
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:33,040
I've never,
never seen Santa Claus.

2179
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:35,360
I mean I've seen one on TV.
Oh No.

2180
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:37,960
I've seen in real life there was black
Santa clauses.

2181
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,160
There was William Northland Mall where,
which mostly blacks.

2182
01:35:40,161 --> 01:35:43,280
I think that's why that has kind of suck
for being a black kid.

2183
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:47,240
I told you that when went to to a planet
of the apes in an all black movie

2184
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,780
theater in Philly that I really started
thinking about what it must be like to

2185
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:54,140
have every fucking movie that they were
preview was all these white people,

2186
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,250
white people,
white people,

2187
01:35:55,251 --> 01:35:56,084
white people,
White.

2188
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,830
Everything is white problem,
white movie,

2189
01:35:57,831 --> 01:35:59,300
White Silliness,
and I'm like,

2190
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:01,160
wow,
let's say you gotta be fucking weird as

2191
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:01,994
Shit,
man.

2192
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:07,720
The only superhero he got was blade
fucker for a couple of years.

2193
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:09,690
It really was that movies back to the
boat.

2194
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:14,830
First will be is there's a lot of black
comics who dress up like chicks.

2195
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:19,520
Like that's the one part.
Like why that so,

2196
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:20,930
so funny.
Yeah.

2197
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:24,050
You know Chappelle talk about that.
Yeah.

2198
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:26,390
Dave Chappelle had like a.
He was on like one of those shows like

2199
01:36:26,391 --> 01:36:28,490
inside the actor's studio,
we just like what?

2200
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,920
What is it that when a black man becomes
really famous,

2201
01:36:30,921 --> 01:36:33,140
they want to make them dress as a woman
and they showed.

2202
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:37,340
They showed all these pictures of
Richard Pryor doing it and all these

2203
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,800
different comics doing it all throughout
history.

2204
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:42,800
Martin Lawrence doing it,
Jamie Foxx doing it and like,

2205
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:43,551
wow.
Yeah,

2206
01:36:43,551 --> 01:36:46,910
that is weird.
Why do all these prayer is what?

2207
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:47,930
What is that?
Why?

2208
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:51,760
Why is it like.
Was it flip Wilson the first flip

2209
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:52,810
bullshit.
Fuck.

2210
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,080
Is that about.
What does that.

2211
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:56,140
That funny though.
I know it's,

2212
01:36:56,630 --> 01:37:01,630
to me it's got to be like the ultimate,
like a black man trying to be as like an

2213
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:09,830
aggressive towards women as possible.
What's the most,

2214
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,440
the most unimpressive thing you can be
is be a woman.

2215
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,880
Dress up like a woman.
Oh God.

2216
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:16,160
What you talking about?
Like that's not a guy trying to get some

2217
01:37:16,161 --> 01:37:16,730
pussy.

2218
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:20,000
It's like the complete polar opposite of
what white people are afraid of in a

2219
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:21,110
black guy.
Well,

2220
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:26,111
white people are afraid of in a black
guy is a fucking big muscular black man

2221
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:29,450
with a giant Black Dick.
Some big football player,

2222
01:37:29,451 --> 01:37:32,690
Nfl Stud athlete that wants to fuck your
woman.

2223
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:36,380
So what is the polar opposite of that?
What's a black man being all silly and

2224
01:37:36,381 --> 01:37:37,940
address dressing like a woman?
Well,

2225
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:39,800
he's not even trying to get some,
get any pussy.

2226
01:37:39,801 --> 01:37:42,320
Look at him because he had lipstick on
and makeup and shit.

2227
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:44,640
He makes me relax,
you know?

2228
01:37:44,641 --> 01:37:45,380
He's like,
well,

2229
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:49,430
what'd you say?
That's not a black eye trying to get

2230
01:37:49,431 --> 01:37:52,100
laid at all.
I think that's what it is.

2231
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:53,730
I think that's what it is.
I'm going to check.

2232
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,160
It's white.
People are of black dicks

2233
01:37:56,250 --> 01:38:00,510
so forces these black people to try it.
A little bit of a black planet bitches.

2234
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,860
That's right.
I get one point.

2235
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:06,000
If it's a black dude,
I just can't.

2236
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:08,130
What's wrong with you?
Because he doesn't have a black dick and

2237
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:11,300
somebody can get into the fantasy.
It's nothing about me being raised.

2238
01:38:11,301 --> 01:38:12,630
This is.
I think it's gay.

2239
01:38:12,631 --> 01:38:16,180
If you watch a black guy fucking a white
chick if you're a white guy because.

2240
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,390
Because now you can't even pretend that
to you.

2241
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:20,280
See,
if you're a white guy,

2242
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:24,260
you can pretend that your desk,
you could beat off and watch a girl give

2243
01:38:24,261 --> 01:38:27,210
head and pretend that she's given you 10
shit.

2244
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:27,751
Man,
I can't.

2245
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:29,160
I'm not.
I know I'm looking at a laptop.

2246
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:31,350
What I like to see though is like a
fucking black check.

2247
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:35,280
Like really a black chick or black dude
really pounding a little white chick.

2248
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,770
I think that's because you know it's not
fake.

2249
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:39,240
That's what you want.
No,

2250
01:38:39,241 --> 01:38:40,300
no.
Because you know deep.

2251
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:42,900
You want that power.
You know what that dominant do you want

2252
01:38:42,901 --> 01:38:46,800
him to see a real fucking hard fucking.
You don't want to see if making love.

2253
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:47,790
Okay,
burn.

2254
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:50,400
I love listening.
I was just trying to make a joke.

2255
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:52,140
Dude.
I don't really believe that there's

2256
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:53,780
something gay about watching black
dicks.

2257
01:38:53,781 --> 01:38:56,220
I was trying to go in a little comedy
rap videos.

2258
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:59,550
So if you want to go on with your little
freak shit and talking about like

2259
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:02,280
watching a girl get fucked in a way that
you're not capable of and that's what

2260
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:04,560
really turns you on.
Or you go for it buddy.

2261
01:39:04,561 --> 01:39:06,600
You're like legit trying to take.
I do like bulge of.

2262
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:09,360
What the fuck is that about?
Getting head pretend to get my dick

2263
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:09,660
sucked.

2264
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:11,210
You can print.
You liked the whole thing of look,

2265
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:13,780
I listened.
Some girls are good at sucking Nixon.

2266
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,320
It's awesome.
I like to see a woman snack for a little

2267
01:39:16,321 --> 01:39:19,020
while,
but I really liked the art of seeing the

2268
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:21,360
chick suck a dick.
I'm going to be honest.

2269
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:22,800
Why do.
Why is it shocking?

2270
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,240
Let me explain something to you.
Ah,

2271
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,570
yeah.
You print a tenants your Dick.

2272
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,800
That's why you don't want to watch black
ones.

2273
01:39:28,801 --> 01:39:32,220
I was in county jail and I've never
looked at a black cock.

2274
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:33,270
No.
Do I want to see one?

2275
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:36,900
When I popped on that Kim Kardashian and
tape and I seem a little odd.

2276
01:39:36,901 --> 01:39:39,330
Jay's fucking Dick.
Stop.

2277
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,930
I turned that mother fuck off.
Understand me and I remember telling my

2278
01:39:42,931 --> 01:39:43,764
buddy,
I'm not fucking.

2279
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:44,670
He was like,
you're prejudice,

2280
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,880
prejudice a black Dick.
I'm just prejudice a dick.

2281
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,930
That black one was like fucking jaws.

2282
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,590
It didn't stop fucking stop,
but even had the jaws music.

2283
01:39:52,591 --> 01:39:56,580
I thought that that was the worst thing
I ever seen him.

2284
01:39:56,610 --> 01:40:00,990
Like I looked at that tape to see how
hot she was and I hit it off from the

2285
01:40:00,991 --> 01:40:05,880
fear like I had flunked.
It was his dick harass her.

2286
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:07,380
Awesome.
She got fucked.

2287
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:09,630
She got.
I only watched it,

2288
01:40:09,631 --> 01:40:11,840
but what she goes,
I want to come again as you sweat and

2289
01:40:11,841 --> 01:40:13,500
I'm like,
this is a fucking pig.

2290
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:18,870
This chick is a fucking amazing how far
she's come with that and we don't give a

2291
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:20,570
fuck.
I shit got fucked really hard.

2292
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:23,100
People loved it.
You got it.

2293
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,560
It will.
It has to be accidental.

2294
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:29,100
You can't put it out yourself.
You can't make a video and go hears me

2295
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:33,270
fucking because no porn star is ever
reached the status of Kim Kardashian.

2296
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:38,390
She's done is accidentally have it and
put it out and that's why she's about to

2297
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,350
start making God.
But that's,

2298
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:43,110
that's how she got 50 million already.
She got,

2299
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:45,900
she got into a back door.
She did something amazing guys,

2300
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:49,140
but she did something amazing.
Can we pay for porn?

2301
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:52,760
We paid the see a black guy fucking a
white chick chick,

2302
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:53,973
black guy.

2303
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:59,230
She fucked that mother fucker out of
clear love or whatever the fuck it was.

2304
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:04,300
Oh,
she fucked his brains out.

2305
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:07,740
It wasn't like pulling.
That's why it shocked [inaudible] right?

2306
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,310
Boys and girls,
it was like,

2307
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:11,210
you know when you do pull,
you show up at one.

2308
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:15,300
This gave us something different and
dog,

2309
01:41:15,301 --> 01:41:17,170
whatever the gave gave us.
I told Joe,

2310
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:18,520
you know,
we wake up in the morning where like,

2311
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:21,400
where are we doing a set plan that bitch
wakes up and says,

2312
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:24,700
how am I gonna?
How am I going to be the number one

2313
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:29,110
trending topic on yahoo and Google and
if you look at Google and Yahoo,

2314
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,530
she's number one three days a fucking
week.

2315
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:34,690
I don't know what the fuck she does,
but she's a genius.

2316
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,970
Whatever she did because she can't.
She's a genius.

2317
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:38,350
Attention whore.
Yeah.

2318
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:39,910
She.
What she is is the Michael Jordan of

2319
01:41:39,911 --> 01:41:40,744
attention horse

2320
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:43,970
and now she's dating a super tall guy
with probably the biggest dick.

2321
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,260
Oh.
And he's worthless.

2322
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:49,910
That sees that fucking monster alive.
Then they just told her the other day

2323
01:41:49,911 --> 01:41:51,810
that she was married before he.
He's like,

2324
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:54,110
really?
Shoot that fucking Momma thinks he's the

2325
01:41:54,111 --> 01:41:56,270
first one that fucked up.
You don't know that she's been

2326
01:41:56,271 --> 01:41:58,840
swallowing pickup and fucking calabasas.
She was 15.

2327
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,710
Well,
he's probably just excited to be with

2328
01:42:00,711 --> 01:42:04,880
someone famous public guy.
What does he do?

2329
01:42:04,881 --> 01:42:05,714
He plays basketball.

2330
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:10,840
He looks like he plays basketball so you
play huge and like his dick was just

2331
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:13,250
like curl up in her.
But like a snail or something,

2332
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:15,520
movies focused on,
you know,

2333
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:18,080
they let that a max hardcore guy out of
jail.

2334
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:21,890
Speaking of like levels of shit if you
don't know who he is.

2335
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:27,070
He's a guy who got arrested in Florida
because Florida has some crazy laws were

2336
01:42:27,321 --> 01:42:31,010
like if you ship things to their car,
they have like very strict ideas of

2337
01:42:31,011 --> 01:42:33,590
what's offensive and what is uh,
what's the,

2338
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:34,970
what's the word?
Obscenity,

2339
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:36,800
you know.
And this is what the guy was arrested

2340
01:42:36,801 --> 01:42:41,780
for because the porn was obscene.
He's got some hardcore shit where he

2341
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:46,340
pisses and girl's ass holes,
holes their asshole open sticks a straw

2342
01:42:46,341 --> 01:42:49,100
in it and makes them drink the piss out
of their asshole.

2343
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,600
Yeah,
I mean he goes deep for that fucking

2344
01:42:53,601 --> 01:42:58,130
giving me me want to Luci who?
What's that crazy guy that my buddy sent

2345
01:42:58,131 --> 01:42:59,530
me a link and that like I thought it was
okay.

2346
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:02,510
Joe,
who's the Italian guy to fuck bitches.

2347
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:07,930
That's my.
Goes about Kupong.

2348
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:12,980
Fuck that shit.
You let her keep her ass.

2349
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,130
He fucking fuck him.
And he asked to make some fucking suck

2350
01:43:16,131 --> 01:43:17,990
his dick while they're eating a slice of
pizza.

2351
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:22,470
That's gangster right there.
He's one of the first to fucking life

2352
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,710
from the seventies.
He's been.

2353
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:27,220
He's got sideburns and one video I seen
that says drop it out.

2354
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,350
That said something

2355
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:31,320
gay about being into a male porn star.
Like what do you got?

2356
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:34,020
What's the recent Rocco?
So Freddy elected with that guy fucks

2357
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:35,340
something.
Something.

2358
01:43:35,530 --> 01:43:39,960
There's something real weird about like
being a fan of an actual break.

2359
01:43:39,961 --> 01:43:42,680
I've depor and trying to deepen my life
a little bit.

2360
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:47,430
Really keep trying to cut it back.
Only because it just you as a comic,

2361
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:51,830
you go back and you watch it.
My brain now I watched 30 and then that

2362
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:52,100
damn

2363
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,930
search.
I'll go wonder if there's Asian girls

2364
01:43:53,931 --> 01:43:55,940
with black socks who work at starbucks.
Click,

2365
01:43:55,941 --> 01:43:56,660
click,
Bam.

2366
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:57,590
Oh look at that.
Oh,

2367
01:43:57,591 --> 01:43:59,630
I wonder if they.
And then you just find yourself.

2368
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:02,480
How many did I watch?
I watch at maybe 10,

2369
01:44:02,481 --> 01:44:05,840
15 second increments and the my brain
moves onto the next thing,

2370
01:44:05,841 --> 01:44:08,510
some done a porn add.
I'm done for a little bit,

2371
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:11,870
for a little bit and people write
comments about porn and then in urban

2372
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:13,530
environments I've ever been spanked or
any

2373
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:18,790
requirements about porn when he's
talking about on the process and it'll

2374
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,310
have comments about the porn and I just
get pissed at the people going,

2375
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:23,810
oh,
I would,

2376
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:26,690
I would fuck away better than this guy.
Her face is a bit.

2377
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:30,590
Just be happier watching porn.
Like people are so desensitized now.

2378
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,430
Upset.
Yeah.

2379
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:34,220
Yeah.
I get mad at the kids are

2380
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,153
born at all.

2381
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:40,970
You only saw that I've been on is the
one my buddy linked me to for the Kim

2382
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:43,520
Kardashian because I looked on my own
and couldn't find that on my credit

2383
01:44:43,521 --> 01:44:45,300
card.
And I would tell Brian and Brian's like,

2384
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:47,120
I got freedom.
I don't know about the computer.

2385
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,890
And I'd been on Youporn youporn.
You know,

2386
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:52,010
I've told it a thousand times the chicks
of filthy,

2387
01:44:52,011 --> 01:44:53,660
but you know,
they,

2388
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:55,430
they,
they have dirty feet and they suck Dick

2389
01:44:55,431 --> 01:44:57,130
and all that dumb shit.
But tell you what,

2390
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:58,940
the fucking pisses me off by you for
that.

2391
01:44:58,941 --> 01:45:00,910
They live.
You don't like hot Asian chicken.

2392
01:45:00,911 --> 01:45:03,650
It's a fucking Mexicans don't get your
nationality straight.

2393
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:05,480
That fucking pisses fuck around with
you.

2394
01:45:05,481 --> 01:45:08,150
I'm in the mood to see a nice little
Chinky will show that little fucking

2395
01:45:08,151 --> 01:45:10,880
hairy monkey.
And they show a Mexican from fucking no

2396
01:45:10,881 --> 01:45:11,700
central.
Sure.

2397
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:13,740
It's a Mexican bitch.

2398
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:16,010
Nah,
the Thai ones are Brown.

2399
01:45:16,011 --> 01:45:18,050
I got those brown little men,
maybe Indian,

2400
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:22,430
Asian and he's a fucking real dark.
Like those Asian media,

2401
01:45:22,431 --> 01:45:24,560
right?
They have like the edge of roast beef,

2402
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,780
like it's really dark and it could be
yellow,

2403
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,110
like the skin is like a beige,
but they're fucking noodles.

2404
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,520
Nipples.
That doesn't bother you.

2405
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:33,160
A dark doesn't bother you,
does it?

2406
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,003
No,
I like that.

2407
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:38,720
You scratch got the little light soy
sauce that comes to the green container.

2408
01:45:38,721 --> 01:45:39,980
Not The red one.
Less sodium.

2409
01:45:39,981 --> 01:45:43,640
You know what I'm saying?
I like a chick at either thing I did a

2410
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:45,380
couple of weeks ago.
Shoot guys,

2411
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:50,381
this Asian was so fucking hot,
but she had that soy sauce thing going

2412
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:54,740
that she was real Chinese from San
Francisco.

2413
01:45:54,741 --> 01:45:57,500
His speech was bad and I could tell she
was a dirty freak.

2414
01:45:57,501 --> 01:45:59,930
I just couldn't tell.
I could just smell it.

2415
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:01,560
Look at her.
I could tell.

2416
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:03,590
Yeah,
you could just tell she was flirty.

2417
01:46:03,591 --> 01:46:05,690
You could just tell.
She sat one time and I could see her

2418
01:46:05,691 --> 01:46:07,130
phone.
Once I see that done,

2419
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:09,410
that's it.
I can tell they're filthy animals.

2420
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:10,970
That's just a.
You could close them,

2421
01:46:10,971 --> 01:46:13,460
but I ain't got nothing to offer.
I got nothing.

2422
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,070
She's 22.
Am I going to give her drama?

2423
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:19,390
I can't deal with that shit.
You need big victim shit.

2424
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,810
Shit.
Take my hand.

2425
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,080
And Mr.

2426
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:26,660
John heffrons stealing bitches out there
out in the wild.

2427
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:31,880
So to hear about the UFC.
They just made Alistair overeem versus

2428
01:46:31,881 --> 01:46:35,570
Brock Lesnar December 30th at the mgm in
Vegas at

2429
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,830
a five round fight.
He's not going to show up when you talk

2430
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:41,530
crazy.
You're not be Talkin Shit.

2431
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,760
Why are they showing up?
Why do you say he's not showing that?

2432
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:46,550
The berkey locis is making a comeback.
If diverticulitis,

2433
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:48,880
he had surgery.
Apparently they think that sees cured

2434
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:50,100
one percent.
They

2435
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:54,660
fixed it because the the area that he
kept having a reoccurring diverticulitis

2436
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:57,390
area,
they just cut that area out and you

2437
01:46:57,391 --> 01:46:58,500
know,
they think he's 100 percent,

2438
01:46:58,501 --> 01:47:01,810
but they left the central nervous system
and it's still fucking reflecting.

2439
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:03,690
The shots came,
gave him fill the fucking head.

2440
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:07,680
It's still spreads those testicles out
of body and that gives them the

2441
01:47:07,681 --> 01:47:11,510
diverticulitis all over again.
Diverticulitis,

2442
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,030
whatever the fuck it is,
it doesn't matter.

2443
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:16,030
We'll make some guys got balls if he.
He just,

2444
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:20,310
he think about what he's done just to go
from pro wrestling with no striking

2445
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:23,040
experience whatsoever.
Enter into mixed martial arts right into

2446
01:47:23,041 --> 01:47:25,820
the thick and the game.
First fucking fight in the UFC.

2447
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:30,060
Takes on Frank Mir who a former UFC
heavyweight champion gets knee barred.

2448
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:32,700
You know,
second fight I believe you took on Randy

2449
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,000
Coture,
right?

2450
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,511
Who is it?
No,

2451
01:47:33,511 --> 01:47:36,030
Keith haring that he took on Randy
coture.

2452
01:47:36,290 --> 01:47:36,900
I mean,
dude,

2453
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:39,510
but brock Lesnar is a bad mother fucker
can help.

2454
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,520
We might not be able to beat Cain
Velasquez,

2455
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,660
but brock Lesnar is a bad motherfucker.
Beat heath heights,

2456
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:46,980
whatever his name is.
He's herring out of the business.

2457
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:50,850
Well,
that's not necessarily what he's

2458
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:51,780
hearing.
He had a lot of fights,

2459
01:47:51,781 --> 01:47:52,130
man.
Yeah,

2460
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:53,160
but you had a lot of.
Yeah,

2461
01:47:53,161 --> 01:47:55,110
but he was at a crossroads in his own
life.

2462
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,050
Nothing bad.
I'm just saying we went to that fight.

2463
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:59,430
You're right there.
When he punched him,

2464
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:01,170
he did the fucking somersault.
Yeah.

2465
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,030
I just think it's a little
disrespectful.

2466
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,490
People say that before that retired
heath herring routine.

2467
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:07,560
He's hiring retired three retired.
He was.

2468
01:48:07,561 --> 01:48:10,080
I talked to heath herring recently.
He's in fine shape.

2469
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:12,300
I saw him in Vegas.
He's not.

2470
01:48:12,301 --> 01:48:14,100
There's nothing wrong with him.
Like you look in his eyes.

2471
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:15,270
He's 100 percent there.

2472
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:16,830
He looks good.
He looks healthy.

2473
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,870
You know he's had some tough fights and
they fought cro.

2474
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:22,800
Cop and he fought fade or any fun
Noguera he did.

2475
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:23,990
He did.
He fight fader.

2476
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:25,980
Can I just make that up and I believe he
fought fader.

2477
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:28,360
I may look it up,
I don't know,

2478
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:32,750
I forget he just never fought a guy,
but I think he started doing

2479
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,610
a bunch of other stuff.
It's hard,

2480
01:48:35,611 --> 01:48:37,000
man.
Those for,

2481
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,450
for guys who aren't a name,
it's fucking hard,

2482
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,980
you know,
it's hard to make real money,

2483
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,780
you know,
because you got to be putting asses in

2484
01:48:42,781 --> 01:48:44,280
the seats so it's,
you know,

2485
01:48:44,281 --> 01:48:47,330
you got to beat someone big and when it
came to beating the big guys,

2486
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:50,130
he came real close with Nogueira and his
UFC fight.

2487
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:52,110
He fucking head kicked him and dropped
him.

2488
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:55,230
No girl look done and he turned,
didn't finish him off.

2489
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:57,210
He had a chance,
but he didn't finish them on as a reason

2490
01:48:57,211 --> 01:48:58,960
for that dope.
No Garrett's toughest fucked.

2491
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:00,700
But he was hurt.
Keith haring a left.

2492
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:03,330
Oh,
was he the first fight in the UFC was

2493
01:49:03,331 --> 01:49:04,670
going Jayco Brian?
Yes.

2494
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:09,180
When he was hurt,
he had a depot Garrett.

2495
01:49:09,181 --> 01:49:11,250
Right.
He knocked him down and he didn't know

2496
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,990
Jacob.
Brian out wrestled them and he just had

2497
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,290
a really fucked up knee and he came up
to me and talk to me about it afterwards

2498
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:17,011
because he was like,
you know,

2499
01:49:17,011 --> 01:49:17,940
hey,
listen to commentary.

2500
01:49:17,941 --> 01:49:19,530
You always very supportive,
but what the fuck?

2501
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,431
I was like,
dude,

2502
01:49:20,431 --> 01:49:22,920
you got to watch the fight.
I mean you just took you down at will

2503
01:49:22,921 --> 01:49:24,900
and it's like my knee was torn.
I had to take the fight

2504
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:29,940
and he just decided to just fucking be a
tough guy and fight anyway and he

2505
01:49:29,941 --> 01:49:30,990
thought he could win.
He's like,

2506
01:49:30,991 --> 01:49:32,850
I can catch this guy,
and he just couldn't.

2507
01:49:32,851 --> 01:49:35,550
Couldn't get it going man.
Having a knee tear and then trying to

2508
01:49:35,551 --> 01:49:38,700
fight a guy like Jacob Brian,
a fucking professional mixed martial

2509
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:42,070
arts fighter in the UFC.
She has Jacob.

2510
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,480
Brian,
I'll buy a man.

2511
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:45,120
A boy,
a boy.

2512
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:47,800
A Matt Hughes Against Josh Koscheck.
Is it signed?

2513
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:51,030
It's signed.
It's on wikipedia was.

2514
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:51,873
Well,
I know that.

2515
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,540
I'll find out for cute look we're
telling him,

2516
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:57,350
but I think I saw linkedin said they're
waiting.

2517
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,760
They're waiting to go.
It was just cool with everybody.

2518
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:03,070
Fucking creepy fight for,
for use because it's a totally different

2519
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:06,250
kind of trained for Diego.
Sanchez is not nearly as dangerous on

2520
01:50:06,251 --> 01:50:10,180
the feet as cost check is at least
theoretically because Diego Sanchez will

2521
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:13,120
swore on motherfucker.
He can be very dangerous on his feet,

2522
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:16,420
but the idea was that diego would not be
able to out wrestle.

2523
01:50:16,421 --> 01:50:18,130
Matt.
Matt's a big welterweight dig.

2524
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:22,060
It was a fairly small welterweight and
also encaustic steps in who's a really

2525
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:26,080
fucking good wrestler and is a big
welterweight and has been thinking about

2526
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:30,460
fighting at one 85 and was actually
campaigning to try to fight in the San

2527
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:33,030
Jose UFC in November.
So here you got a guy who's a,

2528
01:50:33,031 --> 01:50:34,750
a guy who can fight it,
one 85.

2529
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,760
He's big.
You know Diego can't fight it.

2530
01:50:36,761 --> 01:50:38,290
One 85.
I mean he did.

2531
01:50:38,291 --> 01:50:41,470
He did on the ultimate fighter,
but I mean competitively in the UFC he's

2532
01:50:41,471 --> 01:50:43,540
this physical frame in my opinion is too
small.

2533
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:46,590
He could do it and you can beat a lot of
guys just by hustling them and

2534
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,480
outworking him,
but his best way is probably like one

2535
01:50:49,490 --> 01:50:52,540
slash 65.
But Josh Koscheck and carry one 85.

2536
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:54,610
He's a strong character.
He's got,

2537
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:56,050
you know,
he's got a good frame.

2538
01:50:56,051 --> 01:50:59,200
He's a tough dude.
He's a serious fucking wrestler and you

2539
01:50:59,201 --> 01:51:01,270
know,
and he's dangerous on his feet.

2540
01:51:01,271 --> 01:51:03,130
Man,
he's got big power in that right hand.

2541
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:07,570
So it's a totally different fight for
Matt Hughes with three weeks notice.

2542
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:11,620
What do you think the shelf life,
a shelf life is getting smaller,

2543
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:14,470
smaller from a fighter,
like where you have five,

2544
01:51:14,471 --> 01:51:16,750
let's say from the time you start
sprinting,

2545
01:51:16,751 --> 01:51:19,120
I,
you get a big fight and then why you're

2546
01:51:19,121 --> 01:51:19,954
taking him a lot.

2547
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:24,190
He's getting smaller or will eventually
be lasts longer.

2548
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,910
What are you talking about?
The shelf life of?

2549
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:27,430
Do you mean how many fights you can
have?

2550
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:29,950
Yeah,
before you start to deteriorate.

2551
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:30,771
Yeah.
Yeah.

2552
01:51:30,771 --> 01:51:32,440
It depends on your style.
You know,

2553
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,470
some guy,
the other guys go with that really good.

2554
01:51:35,471 --> 01:51:38,830
Three year run and then physically
something has gotten like machita.

2555
01:51:38,831 --> 01:51:41,470
Here's a perfect example.
Garlic machida takes very little damage.

2556
01:51:41,471 --> 01:51:44,290
So garlic machita,
he'll run for longer than a garlic

2557
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:46,840
vander.
And who's got this wild attacking style?

2558
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:50,650
You know,
and it's maybe not vandalize a bad

2559
01:51:50,651 --> 01:51:51,850
motherfucker,
you know what I mean?

2560
01:51:51,851 --> 01:51:53,470
Vandelay has been stopped a few times
now,

2561
01:51:53,471 --> 01:51:56,740
but it's because of annually style
randomly played it safe.

2562
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:58,690
You know,
you saw like in the Michael bisping

2563
01:51:58,691 --> 01:51:59,950
fight,
he's still there.

2564
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:02,590
You know what I mean?
Maybe his chin isn't as good as it was

2565
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:04,990
back in the day,
but the truth is that back in the day he

2566
01:52:04,991 --> 01:52:06,370
got dropped a bunch of times too.

2567
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:09,280
He would come and wild and reckless.
Dan Henderson dropped them.

2568
01:52:09,281 --> 01:52:11,680
A lot of people dropped him before Dan
Henderson knocked him out and their

2569
01:52:11,681 --> 01:52:13,930
second fight,
Dan Henderson dropped him and had him

2570
01:52:13,931 --> 01:52:16,670
fucked up in their first fight.
He closed his eye.

2571
01:52:16,671 --> 01:52:19,370
His eye was like one big giant fucking
baboons.

2572
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:20,580
Vagina.
It was,

2573
01:52:20,581 --> 01:52:24,100
it was bad man.
So vandelay has always been in there

2574
01:52:24,101 --> 01:52:25,960
with guys that uh,
you know,

2575
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,730
that have put them in danger,
uh,

2576
01:52:27,731 --> 01:52:30,250
dropped him or heard him.
Mark Hunt dropped him.

2577
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:33,250
But when he got in there against real
good strikers,

2578
01:52:33,251 --> 01:52:36,610
that's when he had real problems.
That's why cro cop fucked him up.

2579
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,740
If you go back to watch that fight in
pride,

2580
01:52:38,741 --> 01:52:39,300
man,
he,

2581
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,610
he beat cro cop in their first fight,
or maybe it was a draw I think because

2582
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:45,100
they had weird rules like if you only go
to the ground for like 30,

2583
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:46,220
but

2584
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,430
vandelay took a lot of hard fucking
kicks to the body.

2585
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:51,680
That was when cro cop was in his prime
cro.

2586
01:52:51,681 --> 01:52:54,530
Cop didn't have a,
a sprawl yet though he wasn't confident

2587
01:52:54,531 --> 01:52:57,560
enough with his take down defense to
have a full mma fight,

2588
01:52:57,810 --> 01:53:00,380
but by the time they fought,
the second time man that was cro cop in

2589
01:53:00,381 --> 01:53:03,620
his prime,
that was the heavyweight Grand Prix and

2590
01:53:03,621 --> 01:53:06,530
he fucking head kicked vandelay into
another universe.

2591
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:08,600
Man.
That was when cro cop was the best.

2592
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:12,440
So vandelay without wild styles always
had a problem with guys like that.

2593
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,260
You know,
bro,

2594
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:14,960
I mean,
but he's awesome though.

2595
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:18,680
Talking about fighters here,
you're as much of a fan of his.

2596
01:53:18,681 --> 01:53:22,760
Even more than I am.
Vandelay fighting carried.

2597
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:24,360
Yeah.
Find my huge vandelay fan.

2598
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:28,850
Longevity now is what you make.
Look at the guidance.

2599
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,830
Joe Rogan turned me onto that.
I met,

2600
01:53:30,831 --> 01:53:34,280
I had the honor of meeting and talking
to him and he just fought a fight.

2601
01:53:34,310 --> 01:53:39,310
Bernard Hopkins fought the fight of his
fucking life and he fought it and it was

2602
01:53:39,711 --> 01:53:41,450
customed to him.
I'm 46,

2603
01:53:41,451 --> 01:53:42,240
Bro.

2604
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,020
I'm not going to get into a band with no
body,

2605
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:46,650
but I'm going to throw punches,
get the fuck out of there.

2606
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:47,670
I'm like,
well,

2607
01:53:47,670 --> 01:53:48,503
actually,
this,

2608
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:50,340
this fight was very different than the
first fight.

2609
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,380
This fight.
He actually got in and mixed it up with

2610
01:53:52,381 --> 01:53:54,750
this guy and he took it out of his game.

2611
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,360
You know,
whatever they do,

2612
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:58,700
it's what they take care of,
how smart they are.

2613
01:53:58,701 --> 01:54:01,600
GSP is fucking genius.
He takes care of himself at all.

2614
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:02,791
Well,
you know what he is,

2615
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:04,020
he's honest,
he's honest,

2616
01:54:04,050 --> 01:54:07,020
he's honest about what's at risk.
There's a lot of guys who aren't honest

2617
01:54:07,021 --> 01:54:08,070
about what's at risk,
you know,

2618
01:54:08,071 --> 01:54:10,140
and that's one of the things why he says
he won't fight a friend.

2619
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:11,730
You know,
he talked about it,

2620
01:54:11,731 --> 01:54:14,910
that I could do this if on top of them
and I see an elbow again,

2621
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:18,840
I deliver it and give cerebral damage.
You know he's,

2622
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:21,780
but he's right.
He feels he knows what the fuck he's

2623
01:54:21,781 --> 01:54:23,550
doing because he's had it done to him.
Man.

2624
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:27,360
When Matt Serra mounted him and was
dropping bombs on them and Matt,

2625
01:54:27,361 --> 01:54:29,610
Sarah can fucking punch.
Let me tell you something.

2626
01:54:29,611 --> 01:54:33,300
That little guineas got bricks in it.
He's got bricks in his gloves.

2627
01:54:33,390 --> 01:54:35,000
I never seen anybody that Matt Serra
didn't.

2628
01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:37,020
He punched clean that didn't get put on
Queer Street.

2629
01:54:37,021 --> 01:54:39,270
He hit fucking hard,
you know.

2630
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:42,240
So when he clipped George in that fight,
you could tell George was like,

2631
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:44,320
oh shit.
Like he,

2632
01:54:44,321 --> 01:54:46,620
he can tell his functioning,
drop,

2633
01:54:46,621 --> 01:54:50,670
like he knows what it's like to get
really clipped and you know,

2634
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:54,060
he doesn't want that to happen.
And he's a very fucking smart dude.

2635
01:54:54,061 --> 01:54:57,570
He's completely honest and aware about
the entire game.

2636
01:54:57,690 --> 01:54:59,190
That's one of the reasons why he's so
good.

2637
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,680
He'll tell you exactly how he feels.
I am nervous.

2638
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:04,620
This is a very important fight for me.
This a fucking champ,

2639
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:07,920
one of the best pound for pound fighters
in the world and he's nervous and he's

2640
01:55:07,921 --> 01:55:11,190
talking about being nervous.
Then he gets in there and just fucking

2641
01:55:11,191 --> 01:55:13,310
shines,
gets in there and just

2642
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,250
lights.
You both know and you and you.

2643
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:21,370
The day you stop getting nervous before
you go on stage is the day you just go

2644
01:55:21,371 --> 01:55:22,204
home.

2645
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:25,600
No.
The worst thing you do with George St

2646
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:30,490
Pierre Man is talk some shit to Bj Penn
when Bj was talking about that shit man.

2647
01:55:30,491 --> 01:55:34,600
You could see the determination grow and
George's eyes and George is a

2648
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:38,650
disciplined motherfucker and one of the
things about guys that are truly,

2649
01:55:38,651 --> 01:55:41,720
truly disciplined and really in amazing
condition like,

2650
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:45,540
like Nick Diaz as well,
is that these guys know that they can

2651
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:49,800
push a pace that most people will drown
under so they'll fucking force it

2652
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:52,500
because they know you might be talented,
you might be talented,

2653
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:54,180
but maybe you didn't get up early
enough.

2654
01:55:54,181 --> 01:55:57,330
Maybe you didn't sleep enough.
Maybe you didn't eat the right foods.

2655
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:59,070
Maybe you didn't take the right
vitamins.

2656
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,920
Maybe you didn't fucking put in 100
percent and stack your training

2657
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:05,700
correctly and have a professional,
a physical trainer working with you,

2658
01:56:05,701 --> 01:56:09,300
monitoring your heartbeat will.
George does or he knows he can run you

2659
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:10,950
out into the middle of the fucking ocean
bitch,

2660
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:12,390
and that's what he did with Bj man.

2661
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:15,280
He just put him in,
put him in a position where he forced

2662
01:56:15,281 --> 01:56:16,860
them to work real hard from the
beginning,

2663
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:20,550
tired his muscles out and started taking
him down and beating the fuck out of

2664
01:56:20,551 --> 01:56:22,620
them and the way he did it was genius
man,

2665
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:25,920
and the way he did it was fueled by that
determination that was brought on by

2666
01:56:25,921 --> 01:56:27,660
that shit talking.
I thought he'd did it.

2667
01:56:27,661 --> 01:56:30,930
The fucking Katya.
Katya kind of wore a monocle for a

2668
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:34,030
fucking year and he might don't walk in
that room with a fucking Monaco.

2669
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,580
He check out of that with the Jack the
fuck.

2670
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:41,640
Not Ten Times 30 times.
If I fucked it up,

2671
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:44,040
I'm going to keep punching because I'm
going to fuck it up again.

2672
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:47,220
Every time you look in the mirror and
blink motherfucking comes under GSP,

2673
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:49,920
a simple.
I went to this thing the more to

2674
01:56:49,921 --> 01:56:54,921
professional Moitai league MLP or MPL
and it was in Long Beach last weekend

2675
01:56:55,680 --> 01:57:00,680
and I got to see really high level
kickboxing like live in person as a

2676
01:57:00,901 --> 01:57:02,070
fucking rare man.

2677
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:04,540
It's rare that you get a card like this
bull,

2678
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:09,600
a cow bull count,
a tie guy with a 198 victories.

2679
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,360
He's not even 3,198 victories find every
other week.

2680
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:16,650
Oh,
he's in Thailand,

2681
01:57:16,651 --> 01:57:17,850
man.
They fight them young.

2682
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,440
They fight them when they're little
teenagers.

2683
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:22,460
13 and 14,
15 sec documents.

2684
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:24,750
The only guy,
I think he's a less than 20 losses and

2685
01:57:24,751 --> 01:57:28,220
198 fucking victories and he let this
dude up.

2686
01:57:28,221 --> 01:57:30,390
Apparently this dude was from Canada I
believe,

2687
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:33,420
and he was talking all kinds of shit and
pushed them at the weigh ins and the

2688
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:36,300
ties are very respectful,
like they don't do that kind of shit.

2689
01:57:36,301 --> 01:57:37,830
They they like,
they have this dance.

2690
01:57:37,831 --> 01:57:41,100
They do rather why crew in the middle of
the ring before and they did all this

2691
01:57:41,101 --> 01:57:42,990
too.
They played the music and these guys did

2692
01:57:42,991 --> 01:57:44,460
their dance and they went through their
thing,

2693
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,140
but when,
when fucking,

2694
01:57:46,141 --> 01:57:49,590
when Booyah cow did it,
he was doing his dance to the guy like

2695
01:57:49,591 --> 01:57:51,240
got like right in the guy's face.

2696
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:54,240
Does that pushed him at the weigh ins?
It was bad ass man.

2697
01:57:54,241 --> 01:57:56,070
He was like a,
it was like a movie fight.

2698
01:57:56,190 --> 01:58:00,360
Like he got in the guy's face and was
doing like pooling arrows and stomping

2699
01:58:00,361 --> 01:58:03,150
on the ground and doing his little dance
and the dude didn't know whether he

2700
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:05,100
should give grounds.
And the dude was like backed up in the

2701
01:58:05,101 --> 01:58:08,310
corner while blue car was standing in
front of him doing this little dance and

2702
01:58:08,311 --> 01:58:10,380
then the fight started and dude came out
strong.

2703
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:13,590
He came out trying to blast but bookout
198 fights.

2704
01:58:13,591 --> 01:58:18,591
He's so calm and I need you start
chopping with those kicks and you feel

2705
01:58:18,901 --> 01:58:22,560
the fucking leg kick over.
And we were in the front row and you

2706
01:58:22,561 --> 01:58:27,000
could just feel that.
Think of that fucking shit.

2707
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,970
Oh,
and you could slowly see his legs

2708
01:58:29,971 --> 01:58:32,140
starting to give out.
And then he was going high with them and

2709
01:58:32,141 --> 01:58:35,320
just beating his ass,
flying Needham Front kicked him,

2710
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,590
finally front kicked him and knocked him
down and the referee said,

2711
01:58:37,591 --> 01:58:38,760
that's enough.
That's enough.

2712
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:41,200
The referees saved them because let me
tell you something,

2713
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,390
they hit boycott

2714
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:45,640
was just starting to break the guy down.
They were in the fourth round and the

2715
01:58:45,641 --> 01:58:48,130
guy was just starting to stumble and
fall apart.

2716
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:50,530
And he kept hitting those fucking lazy,
whack,

2717
01:58:50,531 --> 01:58:52,080
whack,
whack,

2718
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:54,640
whack.
It was crazy to watch live,

2719
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:55,480
man.
It's awesome.

2720
01:58:55,481 --> 01:58:58,710
And you see that level of stand up and
it's like the difference between cost

2721
01:58:58,711 --> 01:59:00,210
check and George St Pierre in that
fight.

2722
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:03,340
Cash check is a very.
He's a very good athlete.

2723
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,920
He's got power and his punches,
if he hits you,

2724
01:59:05,921 --> 01:59:08,050
you're really fucked.
But in,

2725
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:11,920
at least in competition,
he has never shown to be a really

2726
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:13,840
technical striker.
You know,

2727
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:15,820
he's been caught by Paulo,
Tiago.

2728
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:17,830
He's a very tough guy,
but you know,

2729
01:59:17,831 --> 01:59:21,010
don't get me wrong,
but he's not like a guy like blue cow.

2730
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:23,050
You know,
there's a certain level of striking

2731
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:27,250
where a guy gets to where they're like
always safe and they're just lighten you

2732
01:59:27,251 --> 01:59:27,460
up.

2733
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,010
They find your timing.
It's like when Anderson did the Chanel

2734
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:32,370
Okami,
he finds your timing and then he safe

2735
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:34,270
man,
you're in a fistfight and he's not.

2736
01:59:34,271 --> 01:59:36,400
How about that?
How about you're just a fucking target

2737
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,480
and he's standing right in front of you
and bang,

2738
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:39,970
Bang,
just firing off on,

2739
01:59:39,971 --> 01:59:42,100
you know,
and when you see that happen man,

2740
01:59:42,101 --> 01:59:44,860
and you see a guy figured out another
guy's timing like that,

2741
01:59:44,861 --> 01:59:45,694
man,
that's,

2742
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,410
that's a,
that's a wild shit to see.

2743
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:49,450
And there's guys that can do that to
George.

2744
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:54,020
There's guys the strikers that could do
that to George and a straight kickboxing

2745
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,070
match,
but just can only do it when they find

2746
01:59:56,071 --> 01:59:57,370
out that takedown.
No,

2747
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:59,740
they can't.
They get scared of that takedown and

2748
01:59:59,741 --> 02:00:03,340
then they can't pull the trigger.
And that's what happens because George

2749
02:00:03,341 --> 02:00:07,090
hits you with that power double that
comes straight from fucking Mars.

2750
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:10,240
He pushes off that ground and covers
distance in a way.

2751
02:00:10,241 --> 02:00:12,430
You can't believe this guy can move that
fast.

2752
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:14,950
For a white dude.
How is this dude moving?

2753
02:00:14,951 --> 02:00:18,520
So fucking fast.
Fucking girl.

2754
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:22,670
Have a baby.
Just let them move back just a little

2755
02:00:22,671 --> 02:00:23,381
more.
Just Bro.

2756
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:25,990
Just stay back there dude.
Do your little gymnastics in your mind.

2757
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:30,190
So is that boy gets released.
I want your rather tackle that we'd take

2758
02:00:30,191 --> 02:00:32,050
down.
Oh Guy like GSP.

2759
02:00:32,051 --> 02:00:33,590
You could probably do that.
And

2760
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:37,480
back then.
Coverage.

2761
02:00:37,481 --> 02:00:39,910
No coverage.
Just leave them for now.

2762
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:42,700
For today.
We're going to next year and watch what

2763
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:43,790
he fucking does.
Then full.

2764
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:47,140
You ever see him jump those hurdles,
but I was watching them on Google this

2765
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:49,690
morning doing gymnastics.
I'm tempted to go a look place on

2766
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:52,480
Vermont.
Enjoy it for the month and walk on my

2767
02:00:52,481 --> 02:00:56,010
hands like a mobile.
That's how good that gymnastics shit is

2768
02:00:56,011 --> 02:00:56,380
for you.

2769
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,000
And he's taking it.
He's so smart.

2770
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:58,601
Dude.
Georgia.

2771
02:00:58,601 --> 02:01:01,050
So openminded you know he's so he'll,
he'll,

2772
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:03,580
he'll try ballet.
If someone tells them valley and make

2773
02:01:03,581 --> 02:01:05,380
them a better.
I am to do ballet.

2774
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:08,850
Fucking step in there.
The rest with your belay.

2775
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:12,910
It doesn't give a fuck.
He will fucking do it,

2776
02:01:12,911 --> 02:01:13,744
man.
He,

2777
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,100
he's,
he's got an open mind.

2778
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:16,930
Me,
he actually asked me to teach them some

2779
02:01:16,931 --> 02:01:17,711
shit,
you know,

2780
02:01:17,711 --> 02:01:20,260
to go to the commentator of the UFC and
so you know,

2781
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:21,160
this,
show me how to do it.

2782
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:23,320
That's the most people would just go,
what the fuck?

2783
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:25,590
You're the talker guy.
You do the talking now.

2784
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:28,750
But Doug did when I taught him how to
throw the spinning back kick correctly

2785
02:01:28,751 --> 02:01:32,290
when we're training,
so it's completely openminded has no

2786
02:01:32,291 --> 02:01:33,970
ego.
It just wants to learn.

2787
02:01:33,971 --> 02:01:36,340
Just on our level.
When you talk to other comics and you

2788
02:01:36,341 --> 02:01:39,630
always have like a new guy go,
do you have any advice and you to tell

2789
02:01:39,631 --> 02:01:40,010
them,
you go,

2790
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,641
oh yeah,
no,

2791
02:01:40,641 --> 02:01:41,480
no,
I don't do that.

2792
02:01:41,481 --> 02:01:43,550
I don't know what's your.
And and you go,

2793
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:45,110
really?
Really?

2794
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:45,973
Yeah.
Yeah.

2795
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:47,810
Got it off.
I'll listen to anybody.

2796
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:48,790
Man.
Louis C,

2797
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:51,710
k came up to me once after one of my
sons and gave me all these notes that he

2798
02:01:51,711 --> 02:01:53,030
wrote down while I was on set.
I'm like,

2799
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:55,960
this is the fucking coolest thing ever.
I had a King Kong bed.

2800
02:01:55,961 --> 02:01:57,140
He was like,
what of King Kong on a wife,

2801
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,240
a wife,
and he's given me ideas.

2802
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:00,890
I was just thinking this while you're up
there like,

2803
02:02:00,891 --> 02:02:02,450
fuck yeah man,
give me advice.

2804
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,160
We you,
you accept tags.

2805
02:02:04,161 --> 02:02:05,510
I've seen you.
We like all the time.

2806
02:02:05,511 --> 02:02:07,010
All the time people come up to you and
say,

2807
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,030
Hey John,
I love that bit.

2808
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:09,200
Have you ever thought about this?
And you're like,

2809
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:11,810
oh yeah.
It's funny how many guys don't do.

2810
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:12,740
I mean,
I'll even take.

2811
02:02:12,741 --> 02:02:16,430
I had some guy wants him to go.
You talk too fast during this particular

2812
02:02:16,431 --> 02:02:18,170
thing,
just slow down and people.

2813
02:02:18,171 --> 02:02:20,030
And then the very next show,
slow down,

2814
02:02:20,031 --> 02:02:20,930
got laughs.
You're like,

2815
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:22,910
oh shit.
I didn't even see it from that point of

2816
02:02:22,911 --> 02:02:23,744
view.
Dude.

2817
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:26,540
Taglines are a gift.
You know,

2818
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:28,940
when a friend gives you a tagline,
like,

2819
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:30,830
like,
here's the tagline that Kevin James

2820
02:02:30,831 --> 02:02:32,080
wrote for me when,
uh,

2821
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:34,730
you know why I was doing that?
Anna Nicole Smith bit where like,

2822
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:39,760
it's time Kevin James wrote for Rim job.
Kevin James wrote that because I was

2823
02:02:40,761 --> 02:02:41,780
already like,
looked at ask.

2824
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:42,521
You don't get that.
Oh,

2825
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:45,230
he's had this bit about him dying,
you know,

2826
02:02:45,231 --> 02:02:49,130
about Anna Nicole Smith's husband forced
her and Kevin and I were just riffing on

2827
02:02:49,131 --> 02:02:52,670
it and Kevin came up with it's time for
a real job and I became like one of the

2828
02:02:52,671 --> 02:02:56,000
big punchlines in there and I would say
it and it was cool because I would say

2829
02:02:56,001 --> 02:02:56,570
it on stage.

2830
02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:58,940
I would think of him like,
oh my friend hooked me up with a good

2831
02:02:58,941 --> 02:03:03,350
solid laughing here because a lot of
times you do this not to the same bit,

2832
02:03:03,351 --> 02:03:06,620
but you're just so close to it that you
don't see it from that little bit of an

2833
02:03:06,621 --> 02:03:07,920
angular.
So you're,

2834
02:03:08,110 --> 02:03:09,760
you're taking.
It's right there.

2835
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:11,840
If we're both going to write a joke
about anything,

2836
02:03:11,841 --> 02:03:13,520
whether we were both going to write a
joke about coffee,

2837
02:03:13,521 --> 02:03:15,620
you would come from one place and I
would come from another.

2838
02:03:15,621 --> 02:03:19,880
Even though we're both comics and we
both would see like some obvious points,

2839
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,080
you know,
like,

2840
02:03:21,110 --> 02:03:25,010
like there was a joke that I did that I
found out that Ellen Degeneres had done

2841
02:03:25,011 --> 02:03:28,220
a joke just like it years before.
And I had never seen Elon do it,

2842
02:03:28,221 --> 02:03:31,820
but the premise is really obvious.
And the premise was about penguins being

2843
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:34,760
monogamous and the premises,
while they both look the same,

2844
02:03:35,210 --> 02:03:35,930
they all look the same.

2845
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:37,670
Like what's the,
what's the big deal about them being

2846
02:03:37,671 --> 02:03:40,040
monogamous?
But that's something that anybody would

2847
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:42,170
see if you're looking for the point,
you know,

2848
02:03:42,171 --> 02:03:44,090
you're looking for like comedy in,
in,

2849
02:03:44,091 --> 02:03:46,670
in like a,
an obvious sort of a situation like

2850
02:03:46,671 --> 02:03:48,100
penguins been monogamous,
you know,

2851
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:50,060
you were probably come up with the exact
same thing.

2852
02:03:50,061 --> 02:03:52,580
If I said write a bit about penguins
being monogamous,

2853
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:54,230
you would probably be like,
well what's the big deal?

2854
02:03:54,231 --> 02:03:57,000
They look exactly the same.
You instantly go to it.

2855
02:03:57,050 --> 02:03:59,510
Ninety percent of comedians would
instantly go to that,

2856
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:03,050
you know,
but it's like your take from there on,

2857
02:04:03,051 --> 02:04:04,940
once you get that,
then it's going to be like,

2858
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,180
some people go,
like Duncan would get real weird with

2859
02:04:07,181 --> 02:04:09,500
it.
He would find some fucking weird

2860
02:04:09,501 --> 02:04:12,740
spiritual angle.
And will they say in the Bhagavad Gita?

2861
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:15,760
And he would be like coming out and you
would have a different.

2862
02:04:15,810 --> 02:04:17,090
And it's funny,
I have a different angle.

2863
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:20,500
When somebody gives you a tag it,
it feels like somebody sometimes just

2864
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:23,570
give you a $500 bill,
like sometimes you have the same,

2865
02:04:23,571 --> 02:04:27,320
like that's the date you,
if you couldn't have wrapped gift or

2866
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:30,500
bought something on Amazon that would do
the same feeling.

2867
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,540
I had a friend,
Brian Frazier,

2868
02:04:32,570 --> 02:04:33,140
who,
uh,

2869
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:37,050
at the time was a,
he needed some money and I was making a

2870
02:04:37,051 --> 02:04:38,040
lot of money and he had

2871
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,020
a heckler line and I like,
dude,

2872
02:04:40,021 --> 02:04:41,520
this is the greatest fucking Heco line.
Every goes,

2873
02:04:41,530 --> 02:04:42,290
oh,
Salazia.

2874
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:45,150
So he sold it to me for 500 bucks.
This is the,

2875
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:46,800
this is the heckler line,
because I never used it.

2876
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:49,680
But because it felt weird,
but this is that he said,

2877
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:52,020
because this is what happened when God
made you.

2878
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:53,900
Oh,
and just a dash of content.

2879
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:56,690
Oh No.
The cop pull off the top,

2880
02:04:56,691 --> 02:05:01,640
fell off too much,
gets great line.

2881
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:03,820
I just had this past week,
it was just,

2882
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:07,790
I was trying to think of situations back
in the day when guys were preparing for

2883
02:05:07,791 --> 02:05:10,100
battle,
but their wives were still in their

2884
02:05:10,101 --> 02:05:12,920
brain because I was trying to go ladies,
every once a while your guy gets a look

2885
02:05:12,921 --> 02:05:14,240
on his face,
just leave him alone.

2886
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:18,230
He's trying to and I act like I was a
guy sharpening my sword and did the hand

2887
02:05:18,231 --> 02:05:20,470
thing.
Like the wife was right in there.

2888
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:22,520
A kamiko you should have her bitch
about.

2889
02:05:22,521 --> 02:05:26,010
Really you can leave a shield right on
the table like Paul.

2890
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:28,250
That's all for today and then the very
next show did it,

2891
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:31,970
but it adds a whole different spin to
your act when you get that little fun.

2892
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:34,150
Thanks for the layup though.
Yes.

2893
02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:34,761
Yeah,
yeah.

2894
02:05:34,761 --> 02:05:37,040
Thanks for the insight.
Sometimes that turns it into a bigger

2895
02:05:37,041 --> 02:05:39,470
bit that turns it into something you
weren't even thinking.

2896
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:42,900
What's really funny how some comics will
take attack,

2897
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:45,790
like I'll take the tag from somebody.
I definitely trust it.

2898
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,970
Somebody gave me a tag once and it was
fucking stolen.

2899
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:52,440
Adab spinning the guy's fucking face.
Fucking careful.

2900
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:55,990
What time I like when a comic comes up
and sees me,

2901
02:05:56,020 --> 02:06:00,720
it gives me a different angle and and
years ago I remember watching Chris rock

2902
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:04,200
the one special and it was pretty funny
and then he had the second one that I

2903
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:07,740
remember seeing him at the store on a
Monday and he had jenny and the Apollo

2904
02:06:07,741 --> 02:06:09,930
with them.
I didn't know what the fuck they were

2905
02:06:09,931 --> 02:06:11,490
doing.
They were just talking and then the next

2906
02:06:11,491 --> 02:06:13,920
night it was at the Improv and then he
is Louis,

2907
02:06:13,921 --> 02:06:15,630
cK,
and Apollo.

2908
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:19,470
And what he was doing was he would get
this advanced or major beyond.

2909
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:22,140
Give everybody a taste and go during the
week.

2910
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:25,650
I Want Jenny to Paolo and you,
you guys each come up with 15.

2911
02:06:25,651 --> 02:06:27,780
I'll do 15.
We got a party.

2912
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,760
You know what?
I'm getting 200 grand.

2913
02:06:29,761 --> 02:06:32,100
I give everybody 50.
I keep 50 for an events.

2914
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:34,950
I got to fucking pilot.
I get the best of what they had and

2915
02:06:34,951 --> 02:06:38,940
gather perspectives on styles of doing
the punch and you could see the

2916
02:06:38,941 --> 02:06:42,240
difference in the specials.
You could see the difference in the

2917
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:44,760
specials as early specials in the ones.
Later on,

2918
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:47,970
you could see the Paolo,
you could see the precision of Richard.

2919
02:06:47,971 --> 02:06:50,510
Jenny.
You could see the wackiness of Louis C,

2920
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:51,750
k.
let me tell you something.

2921
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:55,230
Not a lot of fucking comics could do
that because of their ego.

2922
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,750
Couldn't do that.
A lot of comments.

2923
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,400
Well,
there's also comics that want their

2924
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:02,770
standup though to be from their own.
Like Louis,

2925
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:03,510
c,
k.

2926
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:04,290
no,
no,

2927
02:07:04,290 --> 02:07:05,070
I,
uh,

2928
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:06,510
I could see doing that way,
man.

2929
02:07:06,511 --> 02:07:07,740
Look,
if you have to do an hour,

2930
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:10,320
there's nothing wrong with hiring a
bunch of people for writers and coming

2931
02:07:10,321 --> 02:07:12,450
up with some good material and there's
nothing wrong with that.

2932
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,520
As long as it fits your sense of like
minded.

2933
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:15,400
Yeah,
it doesn't.

2934
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:17,910
I never like.
Let's think about like Chris Rock,

2935
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:20,790
Chris Rock's not really that good
because he had guys writing for him,

2936
02:07:20,791 --> 02:07:22,770
which is ridiculous because he's one of
the greatest of all time.

2937
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:25,080
Unquestionably.
Unquestionably one of the greatest of

2938
02:07:25,081 --> 02:07:25,590
all time.

2939
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:28,460
And the stronger voice you have,
the more you can have other people are.

2940
02:07:28,461 --> 02:07:29,550
I mean,
looking at any of the,

2941
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:31,350
the uh,
blue collar guys,

2942
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:34,860
but it's funny how teams of guys that
kind of fill those,

2943
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:36,100
those models,
you can

2944
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:38,110
take credit.
My point is you can take credit for your

2945
02:07:38,111 --> 02:07:40,360
own work,
but to think that somehow or another

2946
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:44,110
your work is better because you come up
with a completely on your own as opposed

2947
02:07:44,111 --> 02:07:46,540
to someone who hired a bunch of writers
is kind of silly,

2948
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:48,190
right?
I mean he's just trying to get a

2949
02:07:48,191 --> 02:07:51,220
different point of view and perspective,
but ultimately it's coming out of his

2950
02:07:51,221 --> 02:07:52,870
mouth.
It's going to be his voice and he,

2951
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:55,540
he assigned those writers to help him
with this.

2952
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:56,980
You know,
it's just different.

2953
02:07:57,010 --> 02:07:59,320
Especially if you have,
if you're the type of actor who's gotTa

2954
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:02,890
create a crank out a just a.
You don't have to,

2955
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:07,120
you can't do an 80 percent fun job.
It has to be out of the park every time.

2956
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:09,910
And if you do that once a year,
here's where it would suck though.

2957
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:13,330
Where it would suck is if everybody got
an equal say in what you said on stage.

2958
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,480
See if you were a team,
say if you were a band and it was the

2959
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:19,960
three of us and we had to construct a
set and then maybe Joe Diaz wants to put

2960
02:08:19,961 --> 02:08:21,300
some shit in the beginning.
Oh No,

2961
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:21,950
no,
no,

2962
02:08:21,950 --> 02:08:24,460
don't do that.
You got to the end that we're going to

2963
02:08:24,461 --> 02:08:25,810
put my shit here,
and then you're like,

2964
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:26,950
why would I put it?
Look Bro,

2965
02:08:26,951 --> 02:08:28,360
I don't have confidence in that.
What the fuck?

2966
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:32,080
And then you would argue over how the
material gets delivered as long as Joe

2967
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:34,930
Diaz was in charge of you went out and
hired a bunch of stuff,

2968
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,730
they brought you things and you're like,
okay,

2969
02:08:36,731 --> 02:08:38,020
this is good.
That's good.

2970
02:08:38,021 --> 02:08:39,160
I feel comfortable.
This is.

2971
02:08:39,161 --> 02:08:41,650
I would say this and I'll put my own
flavor into this,

2972
02:08:41,651 --> 02:08:43,750
my own spin on that.
As long as you.

2973
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:45,430
It comes from a singular voice.

2974
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:46,181
Sure,
sure,

2975
02:08:46,181 --> 02:08:46,991
sure.
Absolutely.

2976
02:08:46,991 --> 02:08:48,750
Yeah.
You guys are just enlightened me.

2977
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:51,370
I built around you for 10 years.
You might.

2978
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:54,040
You know what I'm saying?
Your best friends that you get open mic

2979
02:08:54,041 --> 02:08:56,020
with.
Some of them are writers now,

2980
02:08:56,021 --> 02:08:58,270
some of them,
but Chris Mcguire,

2981
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:01,270
some of them fucking came up to you a
couple of times and said something.

2982
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,560
You're like,
this motherfucker militiaman yeah,

2983
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:07,090
yeah.
Sometimes it's better just to settle

2984
02:09:07,091 --> 02:09:11,020
down and take and you might not use it,
but he might open up a door for you

2985
02:09:11,021 --> 02:09:12,640
where your voice fits.
Yeah,

2986
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:15,250
and that's what I'm saying.
Sometimes you have to learn how to,

2987
02:09:15,251 --> 02:09:17,530
you know,
collaboration is a very important thing.

2988
02:09:17,531 --> 02:09:18,910
It's a very interesting thing,
but no,

2989
02:09:18,911 --> 02:09:20,740
I mean that's.
These podcasts are essentially 100

2990
02:09:20,741 --> 02:09:23,660
percent collaboration.
The little rants sweet.

2991
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:26,680
Go on little rants things come out of
them and stuff like that.

2992
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:28,450
That wasn't normal.
Exactly.

2993
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:30,370
When you're talking about nervous,
I do.

2994
02:09:30,371 --> 02:09:33,250
You get randomly,
I get nervous in the craziest things.

2995
02:09:33,290 --> 02:09:37,330
What you'll be doing a television shows
zero nerve and then it's second show

2996
02:09:37,331 --> 02:09:39,180
Saturday.
For some reason my heart,

2997
02:09:39,181 --> 02:09:41,350
I feel like it's pounding out of the
chest really.

2998
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:43,510
And then a Friday first show,
no nerves.

2999
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:45,090
I do a little bit of rituals,
estate,

3000
02:09:45,091 --> 02:09:47,730
state kind of focus to get me in like a
really good mood.

3001
02:09:47,731 --> 02:09:49,630
So when I get on stage,
I'm not phoning it in,

3002
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:53,260
but as far as physical like I need to
wear one of those,

3003
02:09:53,261 --> 02:09:56,850
a body bugs,
I would like to split those up to get

3004
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:58,540
those things.
Now you can do your heart rate,

3005
02:09:58,570 --> 02:10:01,180
calories and stuff and you hook it up to
your computer real.

3006
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:03,040
You wear it for like all week and it
gives you.

3007
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:05,030
Is it.
Does it work while you're exercising?

3008
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:06,160
Because one,
I was stupid.

3009
02:10:06,161 --> 02:10:10,120
It goes around your waist in snow.
They have new ones that go on your bio

3010
02:10:10,330 --> 02:10:12,330
that are supposed to be really good and
you could fully exercise.

3011
02:10:12,331 --> 02:10:13,760
Like I got punched the bag and shit with
that.

3012
02:10:14,070 --> 02:10:14,710
Yeah,
it's,

3013
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:15,680
it's like A.
Yeah.

3014
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:19,090
Yeah.
I like to wear one just to see what my

3015
02:10:19,091 --> 02:10:22,640
heart rate does before shows and see
what kind of calories you burn.

3016
02:10:22,641 --> 02:10:25,740
Do you ever look at it while you're
looking at pictures that no,

3017
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:28,570
I want to do it.
That was a goddamn good line.

3018
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:30,850
Joey talked right over on the stock.
I liked it,

3019
02:10:31,050 --> 02:10:32,230
but it wasn't.
What was it said?

3020
02:10:32,231 --> 02:10:34,880
Do you ever look at that while you're
looking at pictures of caulk and see

3021
02:10:34,881 --> 02:10:36,380
what your heart rate does?
It's all right man.

3022
02:10:36,381 --> 02:10:37,730
Don't worry about USB on a horse

3023
02:10:37,870 --> 02:10:39,160
I guess.
Yeah,

3024
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:41,560
I guess you can use it.
Seeing it with you're watching porn.

3025
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:45,330
Just
gymnastics.

3026
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:48,250
Horse is not even a real horse behind
me.

3027
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:53,810
I look at things and look at when there
was a time when the store became second

3028
02:10:53,811 --> 02:10:56,150
nature to me.
Joe would call me and go,

3029
02:10:56,151 --> 02:11:00,290
you go on up before me and there was
like a fucking store and I would go down

3030
02:11:00,291 --> 02:11:03,920
there and I wouldn't feel anything.
I would go up on stage and literally

3031
02:11:03,921 --> 02:11:07,820
fucking bomb bomb bomb and getting my
car didn't give a fuck.

3032
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:12,160
And then it's times when the audience I
feed off the energy.

3033
02:11:12,161 --> 02:11:14,060
It's like one them to the ocean near
that you're sitting in,

3034
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:17,720
these waves are hitting you but there's
some shit coming at you and sometimes

3035
02:11:17,721 --> 02:11:20,420
you get to a show and I got to see the
audience,

3036
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:23,450
like seeing the audience and let me know
these motherfuckers paid.

3037
02:11:23,451 --> 02:11:26,710
They get in and gets me fucking on fire
and just get.

3038
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:30,050
I see people on the plane sometimes I'll
psych myself up.

3039
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:33,170
Now I'm throwing different point.
Like now I want to go out there and die

3040
02:11:33,171 --> 02:11:34,880
on stage.
We were in Milwaukee.

3041
02:11:34,881 --> 02:11:37,070
Let me just tell you ever had a heart
attack on stage.

3042
02:11:37,071 --> 02:11:38,660
I'm ready.
But if I do it,

3043
02:11:38,661 --> 02:11:42,500
I'm doing it because I like what's going
on right now with comedy and my wife and

3044
02:11:42,501 --> 02:11:46,130
with us when we go out and if I'm not
nervous bro,

3045
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:49,280
it ain't going to be real.
I don't want it to fuck around no more.

3046
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:52,210
I want to be nervous to the point where
my palm sweat a little bit.

3047
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:55,820
I get that way and then the second year
and I check about leaving the door like

3048
02:11:55,821 --> 02:11:57,350
where's that door?
Maybe I don't want to do this.

3049
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:00,530
We were in Milwaukee.
The place is packed where this fucking

3050
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:03,430
awesome theater and joey is in the bag
and Joe,

3051
02:12:03,431 --> 02:12:05,270
he looks out and he sees all the people
in the audience.

3052
02:12:05,271 --> 02:12:08,690
You got this like fucking murderers look
in your eye at all.

3053
02:12:08,691 --> 02:12:10,010
These mother fuckers,
Joe Rogan.

3054
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:11,990
He goes to,
these motherfuckers are going crazy,

3055
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:14,700
and then he goes,
we're taking this to the next level with

3056
02:12:14,701 --> 02:12:16,250
taking this to the next level.
Joe Rogan,

3057
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:20,630
and he'd just had his murderers look in
his eyes and went out and just smashed

3058
02:12:20,631 --> 02:12:23,420
it,
but it's like the excitement of the

3059
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:24,830
crowd all come in there

3060
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:28,510
Somac battery than you see the guys that
get on stage.

3061
02:12:28,511 --> 02:12:29,920
You have their notebook.
They're like,

3062
02:12:29,950 --> 02:12:30,641
oh,
hey,

3063
02:12:30,641 --> 02:12:32,390
what's up?
I'm tired page.

3064
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:34,590
Oh,
alternative comedy.

3065
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:38,020
This guy,
stupid page paid where I literally my

3066
02:12:38,021 --> 02:12:41,140
new little move before each show.
If no one does well I'll even do it for

3067
02:12:41,141 --> 02:12:43,330
crowds looking.
There's a scene from one of the star

3068
02:12:43,331 --> 02:12:46,780
wars were [inaudible] about to fight the
system and there's a force field in

3069
02:12:46,781 --> 02:12:49,720
front of him and he's.
And he's rocking like just get the.

3070
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:54,250
I do that to myself now before.
Well I was just crazy pump up like I was

3071
02:12:54,251 --> 02:12:57,070
going to ask you this because you do
that neuro linguistic programming,

3072
02:12:57,071 --> 02:12:58,030
right?
Yeah,

3073
02:12:58,050 --> 02:13:01,120
and you,
you have like a certain thing you do

3074
02:13:01,121 --> 02:13:02,980
right before you go onstage.
That puts you in a,

3075
02:13:02,981 --> 02:13:05,800
like a perfect state of mind was at work
always.

3076
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,520
Yeah.
What I do,

3077
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:07,920
it's,
it's um,

3078
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:09,850
yes,
and then I was doing it wrong.

3079
02:13:09,850 --> 02:13:12,280
We're a buddy actually say you shouldn't
make it rich.

3080
02:13:12,310 --> 02:13:15,110
Which realistic,
whatever that word is I was talking to

3081
02:13:15,610 --> 02:13:17,560
you shouldn't do it or now you're
developing.

3082
02:13:17,561 --> 02:13:21,520
And so what I do is I imagined the
greatest show ever,

3083
02:13:21,521 --> 02:13:24,160
just literally because your brain
doesn't know,

3084
02:13:24,180 --> 02:13:24,780
uh,
uh,

3085
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:26,530
uh,
something that didn't happen to you.

3086
02:13:26,531 --> 02:13:30,340
If I was asked you tell me about lunch
you had with your family yesterday and

3087
02:13:30,341 --> 02:13:35,070
you told me you couldn't really tell me
the way the launch actually went down.

3088
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:39,660
You've deleted distorted and generalized
every situation in your life to what's

3089
02:13:39,661 --> 02:13:40,740
important to you.
Right.

3090
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:43,530
Where I could ask,
let's say your wife tell me about lunch

3091
02:13:43,531 --> 02:13:46,440
and she would almost give me,
it'd be similar,

3092
02:13:46,441 --> 02:13:50,340
but maybe she was paying attention to
the TV that was on above you and in your

3093
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:51,870
store.
You didn't tell me about the TV.

3094
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:55,380
It's kind of what people are,
what you're looking out for because you

3095
02:13:55,381 --> 02:13:56,214
have a.

3096
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,040
This is wrong numbers,
but like $70,

3097
02:13:58,041 --> 02:14:01,590
billion bits of information your body's
trying to figure out.

3098
02:14:01,690 --> 02:14:04,560
Right.
And you narrow that down to seven plus

3099
02:14:04,561 --> 02:14:08,160
or minus two pieces of info at any given
moment.

3100
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:09,750
Okay.
Like if I was asking you what's the

3101
02:14:09,751 --> 02:14:11,400
temperature like in here?
How's the temperature?

3102
02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:13,830
Unless you are focused on it,
unless you were sweaty,

3103
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:16,920
the temperature might not even been in
the equation.

3104
02:14:16,921 --> 02:14:19,350
Why we're having this conversation.
So with that,

3105
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:23,520
I imagined the greatest show ever,
like my greatest show ever.

3106
02:14:23,521 --> 02:14:27,480
And I kind of remind some last comment
because there was that feeling of big

3107
02:14:27,481 --> 02:14:32,010
light shit falling from the thing when I
really felt eh and right when I get to

3108
02:14:32,011 --> 02:14:33,690
that state,
I squeeze my thumb.

3109
02:14:33,691 --> 02:14:37,170
I put my thumb in between my fist like
spiderman and squeeze it yet.

3110
02:14:37,230 --> 02:14:38,430
Or you're shooting on a web?
Yes,

3111
02:14:38,431 --> 02:14:39,000
exactly.

3112
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,380
That's exactly.
You put it there.

3113
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:40,981
How did he do it?
Now?

3114
02:14:40,981 --> 02:14:42,370
You did it like two fingers like this,
right?

3115
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:42,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

3116
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:45,130
Well My.
Because you don't let them enter the.

3117
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:45,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

3118
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:47,880
He went like this.
Or if I had the things as a kid who

3119
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:50,820
needs prayer,
but I put it here and then I imagine

3120
02:14:50,821 --> 02:14:55,010
that you get that feeling because now
your brain imagines that awesome thing

3121
02:14:55,090 --> 02:14:57,870
and I lock it in like a speed dot.
Then what happened?

3122
02:14:57,890 --> 02:15:00,570
Just covering your thumb because you
want it,

3123
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:02,810
like fighters use it.
Sometimes fighters have a thing.

3124
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:05,490
You do it in a.
In a movement that you don't replicate

3125
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,290
on a normal basis.
We don't do it.

3126
02:15:07,291 --> 02:15:09,870
I it.
So I squeeze my thumb and then sometimes

3127
02:15:09,871 --> 02:15:13,230
when I'm in an awesome mood or even if I
come home and my dogs,

3128
02:15:13,231 --> 02:15:14,290
they're,
they're tag,

3129
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:17,370
their tails are wagon and I'm like,
oh this is great.

3130
02:15:17,580 --> 02:15:19,850
I'll squeeze my thumb and when I'm on
stage,

3131
02:15:19,870 --> 02:15:24,060
if I get a big laugh and get an a or say
something that was really funny,

3132
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:26,460
I'll squeeze my thumb.
So it's like a bank account.

3133
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:29,460
You put happy feelings or good feelings
into that thumb.

3134
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:33,150
So then the for the days when you don't
feel like going on stage or you got into

3135
02:15:33,151 --> 02:15:35,010
an argument right before you went on
stage,

3136
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:38,250
like self up gnosis is squeeze that
thumb and it puts you right back to that

3137
02:15:38,251 --> 02:15:39,420
place.
Just like a song.

3138
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:42,270
It's called anchoring.
Just like if you hear a song from back

3139
02:15:42,271 --> 02:15:44,810
in the day,
you can remember a girlfriend or.

3140
02:15:44,811 --> 02:15:46,890
Yeah.
So what you're doing is you're adding

3141
02:15:46,891 --> 02:15:50,250
your sp dial to tyricine.
Whether here's the deal,

3142
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:51,030
if,
if you,

3143
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:53,310
if you think it works,
then it completely works,

3144
02:15:53,311 --> 02:15:55,350
which means you just have to convince
yourself that it works.

3145
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:57,910
I see you're not wearing your balance
bracelets.

3146
02:15:58,870 --> 02:16:00,560
And when I was at the mall the other
day,

3147
02:16:00,650 --> 02:16:04,100
some guy was trying to sell me on it and
I asked if you've got a balance bracelet

3148
02:16:04,101 --> 02:16:06,600
on both hands if it's better.
And he said yes,

3149
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:13,080
well this is recorded,
but there's people that actually believe

3150
02:16:13,081 --> 02:16:15,210
in that shit.
Shane Carwyn believed in that shit.

3151
02:16:15,211 --> 02:16:18,120
But here's the crazy part about it.
One of the things that are ropes of

3152
02:16:18,140 --> 02:16:19,680
Judaism from the forum,
you know,

3153
02:16:19,690 --> 02:16:23,190
filled the English dude.
He posted on the forum an interesting

3154
02:16:23,191 --> 02:16:26,850
observation that this guy had where
people have done studies and showed that

3155
02:16:26,851 --> 02:16:30,010
they actually did help athletic
performance and the reason

3156
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:35,010
is because people thought they helped
and that is somehow enough even ready

3157
02:16:35,321 --> 02:16:37,510
for this.
Even if you know it's bullshit.

3158
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:42,160
Even people that knew it was bullshit
and knew there was no physical way that

3159
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:44,980
this bracelet could give you better
balance and make you athletic.

3160
02:16:45,070 --> 02:16:47,080
Athletical athletically performed
better.

3161
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:50,650
They would give it to people and they
would still find significant benefit in

3162
02:16:50,651 --> 02:16:54,340
it like somehow or another.
Just opening the door to something

3163
02:16:54,341 --> 02:16:57,070
making you better can make you better.
Or what happens is a lot of times when

3164
02:16:57,071 --> 02:16:59,980
you start talking,
let's talk about nerves or shitty.

3165
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:01,960
If we keep it the show,
you're starting,

3166
02:17:02,010 --> 02:17:03,010
oh,
the show sucks.

3167
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:04,350
Oh,
but that person's probably going to

3168
02:17:04,351 --> 02:17:06,070
heckle.
And what happens is as you talked

3169
02:17:06,071 --> 02:17:08,980
yourself into a really shitty show,
like do that.

3170
02:17:08,981 --> 02:17:11,110
You talk yourself into people that are
going no,

3171
02:17:11,111 --> 02:17:14,170
but I will play scenario scenarios out
in my head.

3172
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:15,580
You you play like,

3173
02:17:15,690 --> 02:17:20,690
like heckles fas having,
but I'm not saying just for a second

3174
02:17:23,130 --> 02:17:23,840
because Brian,
you're,

3175
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,730
you're really new to the game or you've
only been doing comedy like a little bit

3176
02:17:26,731 --> 02:17:29,460
now.
I mean really over the last couple of

3177
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:31,050
years.
Over this nine years off that you had,

3178
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:34,500
do you ever before you go on stage,
you should be nervous as fuck.

3179
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:36,570
Do you ever go on stage and said
nervous?

3180
02:17:37,470 --> 02:17:38,640
Nervous anymore?
You're fine.

3181
02:17:38,870 --> 02:17:43,380
You just go out there and do it when
they're nervous to tell you so much.

3182
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:45,690
Brian did.
I mean people will say that Brian had

3183
02:17:45,691 --> 02:17:47,580
like a shortcut and Brian,
you know,

3184
02:17:47,581 --> 02:17:48,410
all he had to do

3185
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:51,790
was just start doing open mics and we
had them in front of packed houses.

3186
02:17:51,970 --> 02:17:56,700
Brian went up in Austin,
fucking Texas after Joey Dad

3187
02:17:57,460 --> 02:18:00,440
was a steel.
You have to have a fucking complain.

3188
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:02,960
I've never looked at me and I'll tell
him to his face.

3189
02:18:02,961 --> 02:18:07,961
Never gave me a look of go after joey
crush rushed and he would tell me to

3190
02:18:08,691 --> 02:18:10,020
crush if crush,
crushing,

3191
02:18:10,030 --> 02:18:11,660
like get out there and I can work
tonight.

3192
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:15,890
Fuck what I'm saying.
One time we were in,

3193
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:19,910
we were in,
we were in Austin one night and he came

3194
02:18:19,911 --> 02:18:21,940
up to me afterwards like I and he's
like,

3195
02:18:22,340 --> 02:18:25,610
that joke didn't work and I'm fucking
Howard because that's fun and I didn't

3196
02:18:25,611 --> 02:18:26,510
give a fuck.
It's true.

3197
02:18:26,511 --> 02:18:27,620
That joke didn't work,
but it's.

3198
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:32,360
Brian has balls of steel now.
Lane never complained to me.

3199
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:33,283
Never ever.

3200
02:18:33,590 --> 02:18:36,540
He had been off for nine years.
He had an any six years,

3201
02:18:36,610 --> 02:18:38,400
six years,
no standup at all.

3202
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:43,460
He got up at a midnight show in Atlanta,
Georgia at a UFC punchline in Atlanta.

3203
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:47,490
That's a fucking.
First of all,

3204
02:18:47,491 --> 02:18:51,270
that's a bad ass old school club.
To have that club,

3205
02:18:51,271 --> 02:18:55,500
to go up for your first time and on a
sold out show on a fucking Friday night,

3206
02:18:55,501 --> 02:18:57,600
a late night show,
midnight show.

3207
02:18:58,050 --> 02:19:00,780
Fucking goes onstage and kills.
Not only did he kill,

3208
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:03,990
he pulled himself out of a downward
spiral like you did.

3209
02:19:03,991 --> 02:19:07,020
Really good in the beginning and then he
started bombing and he figured out a way

3210
02:19:07,021 --> 02:19:09,180
to pull himself out of the bombing.
You know why?

3211
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:12,330
Because he doesn't have a lot of ego.
When you have a lot of ego,

3212
02:19:12,331 --> 02:19:15,630
that's when you can never pull out of a
bombing person who like takes themselves

3213
02:19:15,631 --> 02:19:18,570
super seriously and then it gets
devastated onstage by,

3214
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:20,370
by a joke,
joking those.

3215
02:19:20,380 --> 02:19:21,690
The people that can't pull out a
bombing.

3216
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:25,640
Come to a point in my life when I got
another fucking email about standup one

3217
02:19:25,650 --> 02:19:28,280
another twit and you put me off

3218
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,860
or people come up to you and talk to you
and put you off.

3219
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:32,360
I'm at the point.
Stand up.

3220
02:19:32,361 --> 02:19:34,100
I want to just say get the fuck away
from me.

3221
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:39,370
So whenever I see somebody like Brian do
the standup Brown and gold bottom ball

3222
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:40,950
lists,
you know,

3223
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:43,640
because it's completely out of Brian
where he just goes up.

3224
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:46,280
I love him.
I love him.

3225
02:19:46,281 --> 02:19:48,170
Just for that.
I give them that respect because I know

3226
02:19:48,171 --> 02:19:51,680
how hard it is and I know how many
exclusives we've all heard and we don't

3227
02:19:51,681 --> 02:19:53,840
give a fuck.
All I want you to do is be happy.

3228
02:19:53,841 --> 02:19:55,550
If you come up to me and say you want to
get on stage,

3229
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:58,430
I'll give you all the love I can to get
you up to that stage,

3230
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,130
but don't let me see your three months
later and you still bullshitting me

3231
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:03,410
because I did that too.
It took me six months,

3232
02:20:03,710 --> 02:20:06,860
took me six months of canceling at the
comedy works and then show it up and

3233
02:20:06,861 --> 02:20:08,300
finally doing it.
Then you get hope,

3234
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:11,970
but I do give you a lot of love for that
brand.

3235
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:14,140
Probably one of the reasons why he
talked to this,

3236
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:17,220
because you don't give a fuck when it
comes to stand up and as soon as he gets

3237
02:20:17,221 --> 02:20:19,260
to a stage your walk at them and say,
where's the drink ticket?

3238
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:20,223
Bitch?

3239
02:20:20,850 --> 02:20:23,610
As a kid I used to do open mic nights
with back in Boston.

3240
02:20:23,611 --> 02:20:26,370
Route was kind of half ass in it.
In the beginning I was into it,

3241
02:20:26,371 --> 02:20:28,890
but it wasn't into it because I was
still fighting at the time and I was

3242
02:20:28,891 --> 02:20:31,950
still working full time,
so still fighting kickboxing tournament

3243
02:20:31,951 --> 02:20:33,930
and shit,
so I was training I pretty much every

3244
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:36,840
night and then trying to go do standup
afterwards so I was fucking tired all

3245
02:20:36,841 --> 02:20:39,060
the time.
I was burning the fuse at both ends and

3246
02:20:39,061 --> 02:20:41,250
some fucking kid that I did open mic
nights with goes,

3247
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:43,140
you're pretty funny when you first
started out man,

3248
02:20:43,141 --> 02:20:47,310
but you seem to have kind of fizzled and
he's being honest with me and I stopped

3249
02:20:47,311 --> 02:20:48,300
and I thought about it.
I was like,

3250
02:20:48,301 --> 02:20:50,250
Shit,
you know,

3251
02:20:50,251 --> 02:20:52,110
he's just like saying it like you're,
you're really funny.

3252
02:20:52,111 --> 02:20:54,330
In the beginning he kind of fizzled and
I didn't argue with them back,

3253
02:20:54,331 --> 02:20:55,920
which is what I normally would have
done,

3254
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:56,910
but I'm like,
fuck you.

3255
02:20:57,100 --> 02:20:58,020
And I thought about.
I'm like,

3256
02:20:58,021 --> 02:20:59,550
God damn.
He's probably right.

3257
02:20:59,910 --> 02:21:01,390
What the fuck am I doing?
I didn't.

3258
02:21:01,510 --> 02:21:03,680
I had a guy say,
he came and saw me in Austin,

3259
02:21:03,690 --> 02:21:06,210
a friend of mine,
and he did show it and I thought it was

3260
02:21:06,211 --> 02:21:08,310
a good show and he goes,
I've seen you like a bunch of times.

3261
02:21:08,311 --> 02:21:10,710
He goes,
you've done comedy for 23 years,

3262
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:14,010
you need to rip it every time,
and then I immediate,

3263
02:21:14,011 --> 02:21:16,050
you need to rip it every time to rip it,
like,

3264
02:21:16,051 --> 02:21:17,010
just crush.
He goes,

3265
02:21:17,011 --> 02:21:18,120
you know why?
He was probably saying that his

3266
02:21:18,121 --> 02:21:22,100
girlfriend wanted to fuck you or
motivated me because then I started

3267
02:21:22,101 --> 02:21:25,400
going know that crowd just kind of then.
And then I'm making all the excuses.

3268
02:21:25,401 --> 02:21:26,990
You know,
I,

3269
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:28,060
I,
I,

3270
02:21:28,310 --> 02:21:30,120
I,
there was a point where I switched off,

3271
02:21:30,450 --> 02:21:34,900
maybe start phoning it in and then.
And then that's when I choose my thumb,

3272
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:36,390
but some shows,
I mean,

3273
02:21:36,391 --> 02:21:39,020
when you do 500 of them,
you're going to have to suck your thumb.

3274
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:40,830
Do I suck my.
I never did.

3275
02:21:40,831 --> 02:21:41,150
No,

3276
02:21:41,150 --> 02:21:43,010
you suck it up.
Don't.

3277
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:44,730
I was a kid.
I was when I was a kid,

3278
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:47,060
when I was a fucking kid,
I was hooked on pacifiers do.

3279
02:21:47,061 --> 02:21:49,310
I was like six years old dog,
big time.

3280
02:21:49,311 --> 02:21:52,760
I used to hide them from my mom and hide
them all over the house and I used to

3281
02:21:52,761 --> 02:21:54,980
play ball in the house.
My mom would see you gonna fucking break

3282
02:21:54,981 --> 02:21:55,910
something of mine.
One guy.

3283
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:58,940
So she had these Japanese girls with
different fucking ways.

3284
02:21:58,941 --> 02:22:00,360
They're like 10.
Jesus had broken.

3285
02:22:00,380 --> 02:22:01,550
My Mom's like,
you're done now.

3286
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:03,560
You gotta pay me all the money you owe
me.

3287
02:22:03,561 --> 02:22:04,670
You got to get a day job.
I was like,

3288
02:22:04,671 --> 02:22:05,504
fine.
I'm like,

3289
02:22:06,490 --> 02:22:07,880
she's like,
I need like 30 fucking,

3290
02:22:07,881 --> 02:22:11,050
Geez,
you know you can make $50 a week or you

3291
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:14,060
can start sucking.
Those pacifies dog stops are going to

3292
02:22:14,061 --> 02:22:15,220
stop sucking them.
And I'm like,

3293
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:16,850
because I would suck.
I'm like the way people smoke

3294
02:22:16,851 --> 02:22:18,960
cigarettes,
I get into a fistfight and run home and

3295
02:22:19,070 --> 02:22:23,710
syringes to hide them outside in the car
and you just see you in the corner.

3296
02:22:23,810 --> 02:22:26,190
Just I want to talk about that thing
that we talked

3297
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:27,480
about before the show,
but I don't.

3298
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:28,591
I do,
but I don't.

3299
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:29,011
Yeah,
right,

3300
02:22:29,011 --> 02:22:29,910
right.
Should we.

3301
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:32,040
We should.
The electronic thing

3302
02:22:34,830 --> 02:22:37,530
folks,
you want to know what level they're

3303
02:22:37,531 --> 02:22:39,810
kicking it here in California.
Do you want to know?

3304
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:42,570
Do you want to really know they have
electronic cigarettes?

3305
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:45,740
Look what Brian's holding up that are
all weed there too.

3306
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:48,270
How many hits $200?
200.

3307
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:51,150
200 hits in those.
Do you know how ridiculous that is?

3308
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:55,890
That one thing you could carry that
around for you for days for you.

3309
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:59,150
You could carry that shit around for
days and just get bullied.

3310
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,420
So you put the weed in there.

3311
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:02,300
No preloaded,
preloaded,

3312
02:23:02,301 --> 02:23:06,320
and it's like a poll.
That shit for preload and it has all to

3313
02:23:06,321 --> 02:23:08,600
about $200.
When you draw it for two to three

3314
02:23:08,601 --> 02:23:10,280
seconds,
two weeks,

3315
02:23:10,281 --> 02:23:13,850
you got to charge it and it's.
This is amazing.

3316
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:15,280
This is.
You don't need a lie.

3317
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:18,210
That is a super blue dream.
Where do you get this from?

3318
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:21,080
The shop?
The only two or three seconds.

3319
02:23:21,410 --> 02:23:22,640
It's called an m,
e,

3320
02:23:22,641 --> 02:23:25,880
d.
A stick as tea is amazing.

3321
02:23:25,881 --> 02:23:29,570
It doesn't smell at all except for when
you you you have it.

3322
02:23:29,571 --> 02:23:32,210
The problem is you can never smell weed
when you're smoking weed.

3323
02:23:32,211 --> 02:23:37,211
You don't smell it plain.
I don't think you could do it on a plane

3324
02:23:37,251 --> 02:23:39,410
because something's coming out and
that's something we'll probably set up

3325
02:23:39,411 --> 02:23:40,820
the alarm.
So what I did here,

3326
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:43,020
it's water vapor,
water vapor,

3327
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:44,780
back.
Why do we need to do the water?

3328
02:23:44,781 --> 02:23:49,100
Vapor is for the cigarette.
They do it so people get the whole

3329
02:23:49,101 --> 02:23:50,660
thing.
You see the fake read,

3330
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:53,870
you go in and then you see the fake
reds.

3331
02:23:53,871 --> 02:23:54,651
Hilarious.
Yeah.

3332
02:23:54,651 --> 02:23:58,580
You see the and then you blow it out.
So people who want to not smoke,

3333
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:00,230
they that you've gone through the whole
motion,

3334
02:24:00,231 --> 02:24:02,010
you see that,
you light it and stuff like

3335
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:07,580
fucking bat flew into Burbank.
I had a talk with a competent Joe Rogan

3336
02:24:09,190 --> 02:24:10,900
Joe Rogan.
It's over Lucille.

3337
02:24:10,930 --> 02:24:12,070
You.
Why are you so greedy,

3338
02:24:12,071 --> 02:24:14,080
man?
Joe

3339
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:21,070
For
starbucks.

3340
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:24,670
Have random drug testing.
Joe Rogan.

3341
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:26,400
I talked to a cop,
Burbank,

3342
02:24:26,401 --> 02:24:28,540
uh,
bob hope the motherfucker said.

3343
02:24:28,541 --> 02:24:29,290
He goes,
look,

3344
02:24:29,290 --> 02:24:32,410
I don't care where we don't care where
the fuck you flying no more.

3345
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:34,780
Please check your wheat.
He goes,

3346
02:24:34,781 --> 02:24:37,330
we get people checking.
Weeding now for three ounces on the

3347
02:24:37,331 --> 02:24:40,240
conveyor belt for security purposes.
We don't give a fuck no more.

3348
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:42,640
Really.
That's how bad it's getting lax to.

3349
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:44,250
They don't give a fuck.
Used to be there.

3350
02:24:44,251 --> 02:24:48,430
Didn't give a fuck if you're going to
somewhere in California now they just

3351
02:24:48,431 --> 02:24:49,620
said,
just check it.

3352
02:24:49,630 --> 02:24:50,490
You're on.
Really?

3353
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:53,230
So you can bring weed through the.
The,

3354
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,600
the fucking PSA.
Don't hold that.

3355
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:57,910
Brian,
what are you going to have all the

3356
02:24:57,911 --> 02:24:58,744
information?

3357
02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:00,310
Make them get on a trip.
Put It,

3358
02:25:00,830 --> 02:25:03,610
put it on the sick.
You got to put your weed on the belt and

3359
02:25:03,611 --> 02:25:06,010
let it go through.
Fucking the thing.

3360
02:25:06,250 --> 02:25:08,140
Real.
So you tell them this is weed.

3361
02:25:08,350 --> 02:25:09,131
Yeah.
They know.

3362
02:25:09,131 --> 02:25:14,131
They know they keep that thing going
and taking his ball and gone home.

3363
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:19,060
So listen,
this was near the end of the podcast so

3364
02:25:19,061 --> 02:25:21,130
I gotta get the fuck out of here because
I'm going to the premiere of warrior

3365
02:25:21,131 --> 02:25:23,620
tonight.
Brian counts me.

3366
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:25,330
I'm going to go see that.
That's going to be interesting.

3367
02:25:25,390 --> 02:25:27,590
Or you don't even fucking permit them
all.

3368
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:31,400
Bucky loss and bullet points.
Darn Lucky Larson going to be a porn

3369
02:25:31,401 --> 02:25:32,690
star.
What's that movie?

3370
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:33,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

3371
02:25:33,350 --> 02:25:36,280
Me and what's the play?
What's the part yet?

3372
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:39,390
The porn producer,
they try to show me because it's like a

3373
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:42,740
big dirty bitch.
It's Watson and a bunch of meetings.

3374
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:45,250
Next,
but when is it coming out Friday,

3375
02:25:45,251 --> 02:25:46,660
but it goes,
gets contagious.

3376
02:25:46,661 --> 02:25:48,530
I'm in no danger.
Danger.

3377
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:51,060
I'm adult day job against contagious.
Do you meet Stephen Dorff?

3378
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:52,450
Yeah,
we were at the party.

3379
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:55,120
What sort of fucking body together?
All of a sudden you forgot.

3380
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:56,250
Then I take it.
No,

3381
02:25:56,350 --> 02:26:00,380
you invited to the party.
Stephen Dorff came with Gina Richie and

3382
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:02,900
Ben Owen.
Owen Benjamin came at the end.

3383
02:26:02,901 --> 02:26:06,070
I left you at the party with the drunk
chick from fucking playboy.

3384
02:26:06,071 --> 02:26:07,680
You forget now,
Brian,

3385
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:09,810
I need to take you to a doc.
That's it.

3386
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:14,530
Body weight the week to meet with the
stakes on Donald Wooster.

3387
02:26:14,670 --> 02:26:18,430
You need to run to my wife.
Went to the wrap or at least a quick

3388
02:26:18,431 --> 02:26:23,431
little brain cat scans
pussies turning your brain to mush in

3389
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:25,470
goodfellas.
Cocksucker.

3390
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:28,270
I saw him at the grocery store yesterday
and tried to get a picture of how bad

3391
02:26:28,271 --> 02:26:30,740
does he left?
He was in one of those little carts that

3392
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:32,950
isn't even the fucking mob.
Whoa.

3393
02:26:32,951 --> 02:26:35,220
This shit smells like weed.
I know exactly what it looks,

3394
02:26:35,290 --> 02:26:37,960
but he was at the grocery store and that
little part that they'll go,

3395
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:39,960
yeah,
this smells exactly need.

3396
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:42,730
I was trying want to get a picture with.
I told my wife,

3397
02:26:42,731 --> 02:26:43,481
I go,
just take a picture.

3398
02:26:43,481 --> 02:26:44,970
I'm going to sandbag.
Don't you should have gotten up to them.

3399
02:26:44,971 --> 02:26:47,750
Told them you will hold it.
Missing something here from.

3400
02:26:48,310 --> 02:26:50,770
Because it smells like weed.
Smell that.

3401
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:52,333
Can you.

3402
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:01,470
Is there something missing off the front
or is it supposed to be like that?

3403
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:03,350
I think that's right.
Smell though.

3404
02:27:03,351 --> 02:27:04,880
Shit.
You can smell the weed right through

3405
02:27:04,881 --> 02:27:06,110
that.
That thing stinks.

3406
02:27:06,111 --> 02:27:07,580
Like wait,
I can't take that nowhere.

3407
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:08,903
No,
no.

3408
02:27:09,170 --> 02:27:11,930
That's the same thing.
You're trying to get me arrested,

3409
02:27:12,230 --> 02:27:14,580
Bro.
This thing stinks like crazy.

3410
02:27:14,610 --> 02:27:17,610
Let me show you what some lights on it.
Just know that shit.

3411
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:18,440
Joe.
Brian,

3412
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:21,110
because Brian's doesn't switch.
You smell the mouth part.

3413
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:26,250
Now I want to just did the smells like
cheese and bread and everything that

3414
02:27:26,901 --> 02:27:28,680
goes in my mouth.
You know what I'm saying?

3415
02:27:29,070 --> 02:27:32,040
Relax.
So I went to on the constant over here.

3416
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:33,260
Hey,
to get done.

3417
02:27:33,261 --> 02:27:35,870
So this is the question that I had.
I'm thinking about.

3418
02:27:35,871 --> 02:27:39,890
I'm thinking about opening a comedy club
and been thinking about that for the

3419
02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:41,510
last couple of weeks.
I've been telling you that for years.

3420
02:27:41,570 --> 02:27:42,470
You're right.
You have been.

3421
02:27:42,471 --> 02:27:45,260
You've been telling me about.
We talked about buying the ice house at

3422
02:27:45,261 --> 02:27:48,230
one point in time when they were trying
to sell the ice house and like maybe

3423
02:27:48,231 --> 02:27:49,850
what,
what would it be like to buy a comedy

3424
02:27:49,851 --> 02:27:51,100
club?
What city would you do it?

3425
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:52,870
I don't know man.
I would have to have somebody fucking

3426
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:54,530
run it though.
Somebody that I trust to run it.

3427
02:27:54,531 --> 02:27:57,380
That's the real problem because I ain't
got the time to really blessed to have a

3428
02:27:57,381 --> 02:28:01,730
club where we all had a vested interest
in and we all worked out there all the

3429
02:28:01,731 --> 02:28:05,630
time and we set it up the right way.
I mean essentially like the comedy store

3430
02:28:05,631 --> 02:28:09,980
was one of the greatest creative moments
for you and I and a lot of other

3431
02:28:09,981 --> 02:28:11,420
comedians,
but why was it?

3432
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:12,770
Well,
it's because there was a lot of great

3433
02:28:12,771 --> 02:28:15,890
comics hanging out there and basically
running the show.

3434
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:16,970
I mean,
that's what it was.

3435
02:28:17,180 --> 02:28:21,530
It was a fun little club where we all
got in and fucked around and people knew

3436
02:28:21,531 --> 02:28:24,650
that they go there pretty much any
weekend and see some fun shit.

3437
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:27,530
We need to recreate that.
We can recreate that somewhere.

3438
02:28:27,531 --> 02:28:31,230
It wouldn't be that hard as long as we'd
all like small,

3439
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:34,940
like $200 to $15 even.
That's too much.

3440
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:37,250
We don't want to compete with nobody,
by the way.

3441
02:28:37,251 --> 02:28:38,430
What's going on?
Mad Dog.

3442
02:28:38,850 --> 02:28:41,880
We have lots to talk about.
What we love to talk.

3443
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:45,770
I want them to the Improv last Tuesday.
That shit is fucked up.

3444
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:48,050
What are you talking to?
Mom went to the Improv last week and

3445
02:28:48,051 --> 02:28:49,820
Judy Brown was.
There was the last time you went to the

3446
02:28:49,821 --> 02:28:53,510
Improv on Tuesday.
So I'm walking around shaking people's

3447
02:28:53,511 --> 02:28:55,580
hands and all of a sudden as I'm walking
out the door,

3448
02:28:55,590 --> 02:28:56,620
get a tap on the shoulder.

3449
02:28:56,660 --> 02:28:59,550
I got a newspaper article drawn on me.
Have you seen the news print button,

3450
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:04,310
front page of the business section in
the La Times that caught our boy with

3451
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:09,311
our hand in the motherfucking cookie jar
talking Robin Hartman sued by Bud

3452
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:12,300
Freeman,
stealing like a motherfucker double dip

3453
02:29:12,301 --> 02:29:14,720
and 15 percent.
And owning the club.

3454
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:17,640
It's in there.
You know why you ready for this one?

3455
02:29:18,220 --> 02:29:20,000
What?
The Guy told the story.

3456
02:29:20,001 --> 02:29:22,670
They told us that they're going to open
up three new clubs called levity.

3457
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:24,650
Yeah,
but said enough is enough.

3458
02:29:24,651 --> 02:29:28,070
Enough of you motherfuckers robbing me.
The reason why they call them level.

3459
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:30,170
These don't have to pay the fucking
franchise tax.

3460
02:29:30,470 --> 02:29:32,240
And they've been doing it now for a long
time.

3461
02:29:32,241 --> 02:29:33,250
Stand up,
live there,

3462
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:36,660
having a good time with the funny bones,
but came out of that coma already.

3463
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:38,360
Cut like eight Jews together and he
goes,

3464
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:39,740
we're going to get honest.

3465
02:29:39,820 --> 02:29:41,930
They've been out.
Mark Lynas has been down there.

3466
02:29:42,410 --> 02:29:44,870
It's over.
The cat's out of the bag.

3467
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:48,250
Are you sure about all this?
Look on that fucking newspaper and see

3468
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:50,160
what it says right there and I don't
want to read it.

3469
02:29:50,161 --> 02:29:55,161
Pay Out while you're getting worked up.
I'm bosses the Impreza and been good to

3470
02:29:55,401 --> 02:29:58,940
me no matter what I'm saying that every
fucking dog has his day.

3471
02:29:59,330 --> 02:30:01,010
They accusing you.
You know where there's smoke.

3472
02:30:01,011 --> 02:30:03,830
There's fire,
but what I'm saying it's a small place.

3473
02:30:03,831 --> 02:30:06,230
I'm not saying anything even close to as
big as the employee.

3474
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:10,130
The club that I started off in Ann
Arbor.

3475
02:30:10,131 --> 02:30:13,220
That basement.
What is that 150 people?

3476
02:30:17,470 --> 02:30:21,880
You can have that place at 200 in the
room or even like Wendy's clubbing in

3477
02:30:21,881 --> 02:30:22,820
death,
but that's,

3478
02:30:23,430 --> 02:30:26,670
that's like 300 for sale.
I don't know if it's still

3479
02:30:27,100 --> 02:30:30,650
that new side room where we did that.
We did the death squad comedy show last

3480
02:30:30,650 --> 02:30:32,750
week.
That side room is fucking bad ass

3481
02:30:33,550 --> 02:30:35,600
people.
New sound system.

3482
02:30:35,601 --> 02:30:37,490
New seats.
You have to have a show there.

3483
02:30:37,491 --> 02:30:40,340
Friday.
My one man show that also my most likely

3484
02:30:40,341 --> 02:30:40,500
yes,
I'll

3485
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:42,420
be there at all.
Depends on where we're shooting for your

3486
02:30:42,421 --> 02:30:44,490
factor that day.
Most likely

3487
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:48,690
stage I need to get on stage because a
lot of dates coming up.

3488
02:30:48,691 --> 02:30:50,280
Ladies and gentlemen tomorrow.
Um,

3489
02:30:50,310 --> 02:30:51,030
the,
uh,

3490
02:30:51,030 --> 02:30:53,970
the tickets go on sale for our show at
the verizon theater.

3491
02:30:53,971 --> 02:30:58,280
October seventh,
Joe Diaz and Wa and we're gonna.

3492
02:30:58,290 --> 02:31:00,880
Um,
we're gonna fuck that place on the case

3493
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:02,850
in Texas.
We haven't been in Houston,

3494
02:31:02,851 --> 02:31:05,610
Texas in a long time.
Five years.

3495
02:31:05,611 --> 02:31:06,900
We're going to.
God Damn.

3496
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:09,420
Yeah.
It's been a long time and that's the

3497
02:31:09,421 --> 02:31:13,200
place where I recorded my first CD.
That's the place where I first got

3498
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:15,600
recognized as a comic.
Really those,

3499
02:31:15,630 --> 02:31:17,520
the place where I first started selling
out,

3500
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:19,620
I never sold on anywhere in the country.
Houston,

3501
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:20,190
Houston

3502
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:23,390
had this whole history of that kind of
comedy,

3503
02:31:23,400 --> 02:31:27,180
wild comedy and Joe Diaz and I went in
that place and when the.

3504
02:31:27,210 --> 02:31:30,510
When my cd got released,
we did a fucking free show there and

3505
02:31:30,511 --> 02:31:34,740
advertise it on the radio and it was one
of the most fun nights I've ever had in

3506
02:31:34,741 --> 02:31:36,350
my life.
And the Columbus like,

3507
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:37,230
oh,
we gotta charge.

3508
02:31:37,231 --> 02:31:38,700
Remember Mark Babbitt was like,
we've got to charge.

3509
02:31:38,701 --> 02:31:40,270
We got to charge.
And you were you,

3510
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:42,330
you said it best.
It's not in the spirit of the thing.

3511
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:44,520
It's not in the spirit.
We were high as fuck.

3512
02:31:44,521 --> 02:31:45,720
We were like,
we should do a free show.

3513
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:47,370
And he's like Joe Rogan.
That's genius.

3514
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:51,180
Do a free show on the fucking building
in La.

3515
02:31:51,570 --> 02:31:52,810
Do that sometimes.
Yeah.

3516
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:54,270
Again,
on a building and start playing.

3517
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:56,610
Fucking show up that in the spirit of
the thing.

3518
02:31:56,611 --> 02:31:57,450
Do you have enough money?

3519
02:31:57,450 --> 02:31:59,880
So sometimes do a fucking free show rock
that will.

3520
02:31:59,881 --> 02:32:01,070
This one ain't free bitches.
Okay.

3521
02:32:01,310 --> 02:32:04,130
Maybe this one because it's at the
verizon wireless theater and they're

3522
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:07,230
charging me.
And that's October seventh and Houston,

3523
02:32:07,231 --> 02:32:10,530
Texas tickets go on sale tomorrow.
If you look on my twitter,

3524
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:14,460
it's twitter.com/Joe Rogan.
It's on today is while we're recording.

3525
02:32:14,461 --> 02:32:15,990
This is the sixth,
the seventh.

3526
02:32:15,991 --> 02:32:17,630
They go on sale.
I kind of just something that.

3527
02:32:17,631 --> 02:32:19,290
Yeah.
The password is speaker.

3528
02:32:19,291 --> 02:32:22,140
There's a presale tomorrow,
September 17th.

3529
02:32:22,141 --> 02:32:27,141
Myself and the flying jewelry should fee
at the town ballroom in Buffalo,

3530
02:32:27,331 --> 02:32:28,590
New York.
I got to give you a shirt,

3531
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:31,650
Joe Rogan,
who's Fidel Castro with a Yamaka on

3532
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:34,870
smoking a fucking blunt.
Did you make this your shirts?

3533
02:32:34,890 --> 02:32:38,820
Some guy fucking design them for us on
twitter and we need two more shirts.

3534
02:32:38,821 --> 02:32:41,250
We need one that says stay black and
winning one that says,

3535
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,970
oh Brian,
that's quite shit.

3536
02:32:44,190 --> 02:32:46,710
And we needed a desk.
Yeah,

3537
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:48,060
but you want to do desk while you're
gay.

3538
02:32:48,061 --> 02:32:51,240
Cat does not just broad logo.
Some people do.

3539
02:32:51,790 --> 02:32:53,640
They're just words.
So just,

3540
02:32:53,641 --> 02:32:54,840
you know,
can mean whatever they want.

3541
02:32:54,841 --> 02:32:56,430
Yeah.
You know what should be typed.

3542
02:32:59,150 --> 02:33:02,040
I'm going to split up.
It's not in the spirit of the word death

3543
02:33:02,041 --> 02:33:02,830
squad.
Where,

3544
02:33:02,830 --> 02:33:07,790
how want the cat?
I know that's not a good sound.

3545
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,350
A good idea.
That kind of has Hitler mustache.

3546
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:12,240
Not The itunes version.
No.

3547
02:33:12,330 --> 02:33:13,650
Okay.
Good squad.

3548
02:33:13,651 --> 02:33:18,540
Can I plug my new?
Want me and job?

3549
02:33:18,660 --> 02:33:22,530
