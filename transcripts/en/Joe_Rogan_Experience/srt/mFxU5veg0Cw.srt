1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,160
And Stefan Molyneux
correctly. Dancer name. Right.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,630
That is pretty good. I mean, you
did not believe the, the DV issues.

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:11,240
I think some people just cough
it up with the thing on hairball.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,070
What the hell they're doing with my name.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,150
Correct. But it's like French, French,
not like we're back French. Okay.

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:23,720
What is the difference between
Quebec, French and French?
French? Um, well, you know,

7
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:26,750
like the Queen and Cockney as
sort of the difference. Right.

8
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:29,690
So Quebec French is like the
gutter at least by the French next.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,120
Instead it would be the gutter,
the gutter, French or rude.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,930
I know it's going to be very nice people,
very nice people in need.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,930
And for the French who look down on
people after the Second World War,

12
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:39,764
it takes a lot.
Anyway,

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,950
folks listening to this where
we're in Toronto right now. Uh,

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,470
this is the first time I've met stuff
when I met him just a few moments ago down

15
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,770
in the lobby. But I've
seen a lot of your, uh,

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,310
internet videos and I was particularly
impressed with several of them,

17
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,170
but really the,
the Trayvon Martin one,

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,500
I think you covered that better than
anyone I saw online on TV and the media,

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,680
you gave a real, you know, the
quote, the Fox fair and unbalanced.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,780
You give a real fair and balanced
approach to that subject.

21
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:16,560
And to me personally as a human
being, that was one of the most, uh,

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,310
frustrating, um, events of our day,

23
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:25,290
not just because a young man lost
his life, not just because of the,

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:29,130
the, the race baiting that went
on with it, but the cloudy,

25
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:34,131
muddy thinking that I felt was perpetrated
by the media and by politicians and

26
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,090
by all these people that we're
looking to capitalize on that event.

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,230
There was the, the, the,

28
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:45,231
the thinking was so disingenuous and they
were showing these photos of him when

29
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,740
he was like a fucking baby, you know, it
was, it was really confusing stuff to me.

30
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,670
And do you actually, if you looked
at George Zimmerman over time,

31
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,170
the pictures got wider and wider.

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,610
Like they actually applied
photo retouching to make
him look lighter. Oh yeah.

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,060
I mean it was, it was like gets
stopped those style propaganda.

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,570
It was just wretched. Wow. I didn't
know that they did that. And you know,

35
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:10,490
they edited, um, his nine one one
call. Right. Really? Yeah. So, um,

36
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,880
so, uh, Zimmerman called and he said that
some suspicious guy rolling around the

37
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:18,860
neighborhood and then the, the dispatcher
said, well, what is his race? And he said,

38
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:22,520
well, I think he's black. And
NBC edited out the question.

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,660
So it sounded like this is a suspicious
guy rolling around the neighborhood.

40
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:30,320
I think he's black. Like you just, wow.
He was actually responding to a question.

41
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,760
They edited that out.
The woman lost her job and then,

42
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:36,500
and he's now suing NBC for defamation
because they edit it to make him sound

43
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,130
like a racist.

44
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,701
Well,
you know,

45
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,580
I don't know if it's really bright for
him to be involved in the further in the

46
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:45,260
legal system, but I think, you
know, what they did was, uh,

47
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,710
it was horrendous. It was, it's

48
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,260
very strange.
It was very strange to watch.

49
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,880
You know what my approach and you know,

50
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,460
we'll say we want to live in a colorblind
society and I think that would be

51
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:58,600
great. So for me, I always try
to try and look at it like,

52
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,420
well if he wasn't black,
what if he was just some other white guy?

53
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,320
What if they were both black?

54
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,230
I want if they were both rainbow colored
with dolphin heads, I don't know. Right.

55
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,060
But what if it had nothing
to do with the, the, the,

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,380
this was a black energy around race,
the negative energy around risks.

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,020
And so for me, I really just wanted
to look at it like, you know,

58
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,630
that Joe Friday thing, you know, what
are the facts? What are the facts,

59
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,464
what are the facts?

60
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,210
Because I really have strived striven
and it's hard to do in this culture to

61
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:24,310
just treat people like
color doesn't matter.

62
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,990
And that means that you don't get to
play the race card, you know? And,

63
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:32,080
and I think it really would be great if
we could achieve that seems so hard for

64
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,900
people to get it.

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,940
Well, it's too common.
It's like, it's almost,

66
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:37,280
it's just as a natural
part of our culture,

67
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:40,730
we weave that pattern has
been so firmly established.

68
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,870
That path has been so deeply carved
that people just slide right in.

69
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,630
Yeah. Well I wonder too, you know, this,
this horrible shooting that just happened,

70
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,330
uh, in the navy yards. Yeah. In
Washington. Uh, Alexis, I wonder,

71
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,080
there's no proof of this yet,
so all bullshit hiker hypotheticals,

72
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,620
but I wonder if this guy was a black
guy and apparently he had a real chip on

73
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,750
his shoulder about, you know, I'm not
going to get ahead because they hate me.

74
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:06,000
That why he hates me and all that.

75
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:09,250
He had a real chip on his shoulder about
being black and trying to get ahead and

76
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,260
up,
like willed or whatever.

77
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,240
I wonder if the degree to which they
did not intervene in his is obviously

78
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:16,860
escalating mental health problems with,

79
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:19,380
because they were afraid that he was
going to launch some complaints about

80
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:20,700
racism or something like that.

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,120
I wonder if that actually scares people
off from dealing with people just like

82
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:26,730
they're human beings because they're
afraid of that car getting pulled.

83
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,320
And then getting dragged
into something got off.

84
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,491
Yeah.
Well,

85
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:33,990
it's almost like we're still responding
to the echoes of the imbalance of the

86
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:34,950
past that,
you know,

87
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:39,951
the slavery era echos and the Civil
Rights era echoes of the fifties and

88
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,790
sixties. It's almost like we're
still not even the ship hasn't,

89
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,600
we haven't made it level yet.
You know,

90
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,980
it's almost like that's why this
stuff is, is still tolerated. It's,

91
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:57,630
it's very confusing to me though when
it's, uh, it's so obvious and so blatant.

92
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,560
Like it wasn't this case.
Um,

93
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,580
it's also very frustrating to me because
as a person who deals with a lot of

94
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,950
martial artists and a lot of people
with the anger issues who have become,

95
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,730
you know, really incredible
members of society and really, uh,

96
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,930
admirable human beings,
people who've learned to harness this,

97
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,670
this frustrated energy that a lot of
young men have with if they grow up and

98
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,970
confused households or whether the
absentee parents or bad neighborhoods or

99
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,000
whatever the factors are that lead them
to be these angry people that can be

100
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,090
channeled and it can be channeled
into a way that develops character.

101
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,110
And it doesn't happen.

102
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:42,111
So when I see a guy like Trayvon Martin
do what he does and get shot and die and

103
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,270
all this, I see a massive loss of
potential just as a human being,

104
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,760
a young human being, you
know, a young human being,

105
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:54,570
the commits crimes and does bad things
about 18 he's not even necessarily a bad

106
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:55,260
person.

107
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,960
What they are more than anything is
just misused potential and misguided.

108
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,060
A human being is so incredibly complex.

109
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,800
There's so many facets and aspects
to being a person and developing as a

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,810
productive member of society that it
needs guidance and most people don't get

111
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,090
that guidance and it's up
to them to kind of find it.

112
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,120
I mean, you see an unbelievable tragedy
like that. I always think of like all the,

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,150
the terms of the steps and the other
possibilities that might've happened early

114
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,130
intervention,
some teachers somewhere,

115
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,810
some relative or someone who would have
just seen something going off the rails

116
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,920
and really stepped in and made a
difference. I think that title away,

117
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:35,620
it can be stopped early.
I think once it gains real momentum,

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,280
it's tough later on because we
to turning around. But you know,

119
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,840
early intervention, uh, really,

120
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,470
really seeing people who are going off
the rails and then really working to

121
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,570
intervene.
If we could get that down as a society.

122
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,340
And I think we'd live in a different,

123
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,970
well we would,
I would absolutely agree with you.

124
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:54,270
We would work live in a different
world. But it's, it is very, very,

125
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:58,080
very difficult to do and incredibly
difficult to pull someone out of that

126
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:02,100
momentum. The men momentum of
being a bad person and you know,

127
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:04,350
and almost reveling in it,
you know,

128
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,290
which is a big aspect of gangster rap

129
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,490
or you know, they've, they've done
some really interesting studies where,

130
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,530
cause you know, they just over
the last 10 or 15 years ago,

131
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,670
we see inside the brain, like for the
first time it happened again. This FMRI,

132
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,650
you can really see inside the brain
and they found people who, they've,

133
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,450
who'd been identified a status and they
show them pictures of people being hurt

134
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:27,410
intentionally and they're like happy joy
centers light up that little like bring

135
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,270
dancers. That's so messed up. You
know, cause it's like opposite,

136
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,060
cause we'll all think we've
got this thing from religion.

137
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,860
Like everyone has a soul and
we're all kind of equal. Oh,

138
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,470
made in the image of God and
this and that and the other.

139
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,530
But it's according to this, people I've
talked to in the research that I've done,

140
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,040
I mean there's some real predators among
us who really are not kind of like us

141
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,920
at all. And it's somebody
who like cs, you know,

142
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,840
some cat being driven over and he
giggles and like finds that really quite

143
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:57,170
thrilling. I mean that, I didn't
even know what species that it is,

144
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,570
but I think there are a lot of
people out there that they make life.

145
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,870
If I go for the rest of us. Yeah,
it's a real issue. It's very scary.

146
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,680
And how are these people becoming that?
Is it because of nature or nurture?

147
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,000
Is it because of,
you know,

148
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,250
abuse that they've personally
suffered that sort of stimulating?

149
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,510
Yeah. Well so I mean this
is the fascinating thing
about epigenetics, right? So,

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
I mean, when I was a kid growing up,
there was this nature versus nurture.

151
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:21,160
Like you got your, if what
you're born with, right?

152
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:22,900
And then maybe you can
influence it a bit with nature.

153
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,590
But what they're finding out now is
that genes turn on and off depending on

154
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:27,370
experience.

155
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,540
So they found like if you have a
particular gene and your boy and you are

156
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,170
physically abused as a child, almost
for certain that you're going to end up,

157
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,900
you know, on the bad side of things,
like you're gonna end up violent,

158
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,050
aggressive criminal J or whatever.
Right now if you don't have that gene,

159
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,740
you're abused like you
heard, but it's less. Uh,

160
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,020
and so certain genes for aggression get
turned on and strengthened based upon

161
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:47,651
your experiences.

162
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:50,230
You can end up deck twins who grew up
in different households can end up with

163
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,180
different genetics based
on their environment.

164
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,980
So that's what's so important about,
you know, something I focused a lot on,

165
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:57,030
is it parenting?
Parenting,

166
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,090
parenting seems to be so many people
that are out there and they're just so

167
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,140
messed up.
Like you just,

168
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,810
you can't rewind and you can't
send them down a different path.

169
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,510
But if you kind of look at the next
generation, the next generation,

170
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,590
what if we could have the percentage of
people spanking their children down from

171
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,790
90%.
I mean,

172
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,860
it seems so weird in the 21st century
that that's how parents are really focused

173
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,570
person depending on where you counted, 80
to 90%. It's less so in Europe, like in,

174
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:23,640
in Sweden,
I think it's been banned since like 1973.

175
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,350
And y'all know what a hell
hole, sweetness, yeah, they're
doing fine. But um, yeah,

176
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,960
it's still 80 to 90%
in, uh, well it's legal.

177
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,430
It's legal in America from two to 12.
You can hit a child in Canada legally,

178
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,690
just not at the face and not with
an implement. Um, so it's just,

179
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,350
and cause these are the most vulnerable,
tender, helpless, dependent, you know,

180
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:46,650
lack of freedom, members of
society. And uh, but it's, you know,

181
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,140
it's hard to see how our
weird society that we have.

182
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,720
You had this great bit last night. Go
see the show. Anyone has listened to.

183
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,490
This is my show.

184
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,270
We did this great bit like what a space
aliens come down and try and understand.

185
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,730
You had Kim kind of ask you in which
of course is tough enough, but,

186
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,690
but what if they tried to understand that
culture? It wouldn't make much sense,

187
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,740
but you realize that the hierarchies and
everything that we have there, the wars,

188
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,890
the prisons, prisons, the prison
guards from wards, you need soldiers,

189
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,600
you can't get healthy,
happy,

190
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,940
well adjusted people to go
out and do that kind of stuff.

191
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,360
So I think our whole society relies
upon the maltreatment of children.

192
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,250
And if we didn't have that,

193
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,520
a lot of people that got a lot of money
and power right now would kind of find

194
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:25,080
themselves out in the cold.
Yeah.

195
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,390
I don't necessarily think
that it's engineered that way,

196
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:30,300
but I certainly think it takes
advantage of the situation at hand.

197
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,070
I don't think there's a secret cabal,
secret handshake, but you know,

198
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,610
lions get together to hand else.

199
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,140
They don't have to plot it
out in some smokey romance.

200
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,750
It's just their instincts
to go get the guns.

201
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,270
That does get sort of a
hypothesized though, right?

202
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,980
The that that is what's happening,

203
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:47,630
that they're trying to keep people
down with a lack of education.

204
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,370
That's why there's such little funding
for schools and they're trying to keep

205
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:54,850
people poor because poor people don't
raise their kids correctly and you know,

206
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,700
and so on and so forth,
and then it continues.

207
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,810
I think we have an instinct for domination
as human beings and I think animals

208
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:02,431
do too,

209
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,720
and they don't have secret cabals and
Rockefellers and smoky rooms organizing

210
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:06,290
everything.

211
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,950
I think we just have an instinct for
domination and it plays itself out,

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,860
but I don't think it's something written
down and handed out in the secret and

213
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,200
rails scrolls or something like that.

214
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,730
I agree with you. I think we also have
an instinct for escalation, you know,

215
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:22,320
and no matter what, we always want
more, you know, if we make $500 a week,

216
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:26,130
we want seven. If we, if we
control middle of the Middle East,

217
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:28,380
we want to control Africa,
we want to, it's just,

218
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:31,320
it's a natural thing that
if we do a certain thing,

219
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,880
we will continue to do it and try to push
the envelope further and further until

220
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,980
we hit some sort of a wall or resistance.

221
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,730
But I think in America we are starting
to see that wall built up and,

222
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,290
and gain momentum.
The wall of resistance against the Syria.

223
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,760
A invasion was bigger than anything
that I'd ever seen in my entire life.

224
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,540
I'd never seen a university across the
the entire country go, fuck this. Yeah,

225
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,643
this is crazy.

226
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,080
You're not, this might be the first
war. It's actually stopped. Yeah.

227
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,270
Like in history,

228
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,460
so you'd be the first war that popular
was an resistance has actually stopped

229
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,460
against all the financial,
military,

230
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:14,330
industrial complex momentum that is
in the states, which is huge. Right?

231
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:17,710
I don't know if you know the fact that
the people who vote voted Yes for the war

232
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,500
in Syria get 86% more funding for the
military industrial complex and the people

233
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:25,160
who voted, now that's just voting to
send money in blood to the donors, right?

234
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,970
I mean it's horrible. Uh,
but, but the half that it
might actually be pushed back.

235
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,150
And the fact that the Russian guy that
Putin is telling the recipient of the

236
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:39,170
Nobel peace prize to not have a war,
it's upside down universe that we live in.

237
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,150
And you know, and not only that, but Putin
said a really interesting thing about,

238
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,040
about claiming that citizens of the
United States are exceptional and how

239
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:52,330
dangerous that is and about how
we are all just human beings.

240
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:57,331
And to have anybody established as
being the exceptional people is a very

241
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,560
dangerous idea.

242
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:04,270
And for the United States to sort of
promote this idea that we as Americans are

243
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:07,840
different. Like, yeah, that's,
that's, he's absolutely right.

244
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,180
If an individual displays
that characteristics,

245
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,890
they're called entitled or narcissistic,

246
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,770
which means that just good things
come should come to me no matter what.

247
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:17,380
And if they don't, they're not brought
to me, I'm just going to go take them.

248
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,750
And that's a really
dangerous personality trait.

249
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:23,230
But somehow it's elevated through the
magic of patriotism until like wonderful

250
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:24,470
stuff. Right? Yeah, that's fine.

251
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,830
It's fascinating. I
mean, and as I get older,

252
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:31,150
I find it even more fascinating because
a guy like Obama, I'm 46 the guy, look,

253
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,220
Obama is just a couple
of years older than me.

254
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,930
So it's not like this thing where when
I was a boy and I would look at the

255
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,500
resident, yeah, they were way
up there. There were different
then, you know, it was,

256
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,430
there were always a part of this
system already. Political System,

257
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:47,810
educational system, skull
and bones, all that.

258
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,270
But this Obama guy was the first guy
that doesn't fit that mold to me.

259
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,400
And it's close to my age. And you know,
the concept of me being a president,

260
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:00,460
it was just the most ridiculous
thing of all time to me.

261
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,920
But this guy is essentially my,
obviously more educated than me,

262
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,180
but essentially my age.

263
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,540
And I find it amazing how he has gone
from being this political outsider,

264
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,240
this rebel, this guy who was going to
change this closed Guantanamo Bay and,

265
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,020
and then all of a sudden he gets in and
he's exactly the same thing that we've

266
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:23,220
seen time and time again over
the last eight years. It's easy.

267
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,580
The same person as Bush. I mean it's,
and more and more, more drone. Yeah.

268
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,360
More detainees. Uh, and, and the
only reason he ended the war in Iraq,

269
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,930
it was quite fascinating and tragic, you
know, if you have hope for the guy, right.

270
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,530
The reason that they had to pull the
troops out of Iraq was that Iraq was,

271
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,350
was going to start holding the troops
criminally responsible for what they were

272
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:44,440
doing because they were facing such
resistance from the population for the

273
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:46,180
occupation. They finally said, okay,

274
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:48,120
you guys don't get to get out
of jail free card anymore.

275
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,890
We're going to start applying
international military or military law.

276
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,230
Your and Obama's like, okay,
fire up there, the airplanes,

277
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:56,930
we're going to pull those buggers out
because they're going to be subject to the

278
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,610
rule of law.
And they had to get him out of there.

279
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,510
Well, how about what he
wrote on his own website,

280
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:06,270
the change.org website
about whistleblowers and
then removed it, you know,

281
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,330
after it would was, he was called out
on it after the Edward Snowden case,

282
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,970
like they said like what did
you say about whistleblowers?

283
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,960
What did you say about whistler?

284
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:18,220
Blows were exposing illegal activities
when you were running for president and

285
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:23,221
now here you are the most
as far as presidents go.

286
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,640
There's never been a president that
has been harder on whistle blowers then

287
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:28,630
Obama never,

288
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,750
nor have there been more revelations
and more important revelations as far as

289
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:39,661
the direction of society and privacy in
the United States that was exposed by

290
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,000
these whistle blowers.
That has a massive impact on our culture.

291
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,140
Massive impact on who has the right.
Do you,

292
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,770
do I have a right to send a naked photo
to a friend as a joke or is that going

293
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:55,080
to be held against me? You know, if, uh,
I don't pay my taxes or if, you know,

294
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,880
I have a dispute with the
government over a certain issue.

295
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,110
Are you going to pull things out of emails
because they have someone writes bomb

296
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,970
and an email, you know, as a
joke. Does that get flagged and,

297
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,990
and just a comedian, that's a word you
may well use. Yeah. Yeah. I mean not now.

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,610
I defragged I don't know what you're
going to call it now and kind of use that

299
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:13,210
word anymore.

300
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,680
Yeah, I mean, but there's a lot
of hot words and to me that's,

301
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,390
that's a dangerous thing to I think what
we're in right now as far as the whole

302
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:26,920
privacy thing is this
strange transitionary period
to a point where I think

303
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,920
ultimately there will be no privacy.
And I think,

304
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,310
I don't think that's bad because look,

305
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,640
we were all really cool and everyone
was really nice to each other.

306
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,640
Privacy wouldn't be as as important.

307
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,990
It becomes important when people
violate privacy and there's stalkers and

308
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:44,651
there's,
you know,

309
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:49,240
people that fuck with people and people
that you know or have agendas to mess

310
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,840
with people's lives.
But ultimately privacy,

311
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,850
what we're dealing with,

312
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:59,851
inflammation and the trend in society
and technology seems to be the dissolving

313
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:04,330
of boundaries between people.
And information.

314
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,840
And I think it's been amazing as far as
education. When you look at your phone,

315
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:11,440
you can Google something, you get have
answers to any question. I mean this is,

316
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,760
we live in an amazing time when it
comes to that, but that trend, you know,

317
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,160
we've talked about escalation.
It's just what we do.

318
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,680
We're getting that trend will escalate
further and further and I think

319
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:23,530
ultimately it will escalate to the
point where they'll be no more secrets.

320
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,660
Yeah. I mean I, I mean the technology
that we were having this conversation,

321
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:30,630
we can broadcast it to like millions
of people and I got like 50 million

322
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:34,200
downloads of my shell, which for a
philosophy show is incredible easy. Right?

323
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,790
But this is huge,
right?

324
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,460
So it's like these two bullet trains
going across the landscape, right?

325
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:41,850
And the technology of control versus
the technology of illumination.

326
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:45,360
I think it really, really battling
and we got to keep pushing the gas to,

327
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:49,050
to stay ahead because we've got this
incredible thing. Uh, you mentioned it,

328
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,840
the end, the show recently, like
the gatekeepers are down, right?

329
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:54,450
If we get half this compensation,
broadcast it directly to people,

330
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,100
nobody has to tell us
what we can talk about.

331
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:59,010
Nobody tells us what words we can
use or what concepts we can explore,

332
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,844
anything like that,

333
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,720
which is unprecedented except maybe
for the Gutenberg press and like 15th

334
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:04,050
Century.

335
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,010
When they printed the Bible and started
handing it out to passes in a language

336
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
they could actually understand.

337
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,230
Because before that you had to know
Latin and all that kind of crap.

338
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,470
So they got to read the Bible for
the first time and like, Oh shit,

339
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,590
I'm getting me. This is
in here. This is in here.

340
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,840
They started to develop their own
thoughts about it and that broke down the

341
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,460
monopoly of the Catholic
Christian did mine,

342
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:23,820
which had been around since the dark ages.
So when you get information to people,

343
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:28,700
you fragment the central narrative of a
society, which is great. You know, that's,

344
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,380
that's what you want. Central Narratives
are incredibly dangerous. You know,

345
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,790
we had a great central narratives,

346
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,750
the Nazis that wonderful
central narratives about the
role of the white race to

347
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,690
dominate all the other races in
Germany's manifest destiny and Europe.

348
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,300
Communist had a great story
about that are, you know,

349
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:45,180
raising the proletariat destruction of
the middle classes and the end of the

350
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:49,570
bourgeoisie narratives that are really
well inflicted and universal are

351
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,810
incredibly dangerous.
So all the lemmings we're on the same way.

352
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,800
So we've got this massive airstrike on
a central narrative which comes directly

353
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,820
out of this technology,

354
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,330
which is where you can get exposed to
viewpoints that you never would've been

355
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,021
exposed to before.

356
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,020
If you think before the Internet and
American media would be playing anything

357
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,670
that Vladimir Putin said about Syria,

358
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,190
you'd never even know the guy
said anything and totally road.

359
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,250
Now you can get it all and
you can connect with people.

360
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,120
I want to talk about that.

361
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:15,300
The comedy stuff where I think the
connection stuff is really a good theme in

362
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:16,134
the show last night,

363
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,550
but there's rice because the degree
to which we can shatter the central

364
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:24,480
narrative and individualize what
we're doing in the world is, you know,

365
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,170
they're racing with us to try and control
and make us afraid to communicate with

366
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,260
each other and afraid to get to the
truth and I really view that as pretty

367
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,850
important razor for
like the next 10 years.

368
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,770
Yeah, I agree. I think there's,

369
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,800
the real issue in this world
is a information and then
of course the big one is

370
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:44,580
the monopolization of resources and
the monopolization of resources,

371
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:45,720
which are I believe,

372
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,900
I think resources should be in
global asset for human beings.

373
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,300
I don't think anybody should be
able to control the amount of oil,

374
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,970
just like I don't think people
should be able to control water.

375
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,140
I think it's ridiculous.

376
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,380
The idea that a group of human
beings decided to control water.

377
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,120
I feel like that that's an act almost
of terrorism, of social terrorism.

378
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,300
The idea of keeping water from
people that need water. You know,

379
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,070
the idea of keeping oil from people.

380
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:10,980
I mean if we all agree that
we're going to use oil,

381
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:13,860
the idea that one person can decide,
you know,

382
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:17,400
who owns the shift that has been in
the ground for millions and millions of

383
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:21,810
years just because you planted a flag on
a patch of dirt. It's fucking craziness.

384
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,090
But that's where all the
influence comes from.

385
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,750
The influence comes from this massive
amount of money that you can gain by

386
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,330
controlling monopolize
and natural resources.

387
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,760
And it's just like when they used to be
able to monopolize the information that

388
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:36,271
was received.

389
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:40,500
Just like when William Randolph Hearst
basically controlled most of what

390
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,740
information got out to people,
read newspapers,

391
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,970
that that's a dangerous aspect
of our world. That is eventually,

392
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:51,820
I think going to crumble under
the weight of its own bullshit.

393
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,860
I just don't see how it can continue.

394
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,660
I don't see how people can continue to
live the way we're living right now in

395
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,120
the face of the information
that we're being presented with.

396
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,880
Well, you know, the great thing is
once you go outside and narrative,

397
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,680
don't you finding? For me, I feel
pretty retarded most of the time.

398
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,910
Like I'm not dumb guy, but I see so much
information out there. So many things,

399
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,430
so many stories. I can do all this
research for my shows and stuff like that.

400
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,910
I feel like it barely
scratched the surface because
there's so much information

401
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,840
about there. With the central narrative,
you feel like, you know, well, you know,

402
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,410
we were Catholic so we're Jews or we're
Jesuit. So we got, we got it down,

403
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,670
we got the whole thing down.
Right?

404
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,150
But the great thing is once you
shattered that central narrative,

405
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,790
you realize there's such a vast amount
of conflicting information and opinions

406
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,640
and perspectives and I don't know what
the hell is true half the time, you know,

407
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:37,840
I'm lucky to get 10% of it.

408
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,820
So I think that that breeds a kind of
humility in us that that is the opposite

409
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:45,280
of the desire to dominate. The
desire to dominate is, well,

410
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:48,280
I know what the hell people should do,
and by God I'm going to make them do it.

411
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,340
I know they shouldn't smoke marijuana,
and if they fucking smoke marijuana,

412
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:54,800
I'm going to round them up with cats
in blue uniforms and throw them in that

413
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,670
prison cell. You know, where 200,000
times a year they get raped. I mean,

414
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,540
an American, more men get raped
and women don't get it of habits.

415
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,760
The whole prison stuff, right? Yeah.

416
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,490
So when you feel like you just know how
the health everyone else should live,

417
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,240
you know,

418
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,630
the way we should help the poor is
take money from these guides by force,

419
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,780
give it to a giant bureaucracy and have
a little drops of it ripped down to the

420
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:13,970
poor.

421
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,300
Have to keep them in it dependent state
so they'll keep voting for more and more

422
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,134
government.

423
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,320
If you've really feel like
you know exactly how people
should live in what they

424
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:20,801
should do,

425
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:24,040
then you have no problem bringing out
the air strikes at the military and the

426
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,330
police and the prison system.

427
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,080
But if you're humble and you realize
that we're pretty much retarded and had

428
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,900
everything, there's a few things that
I'm good at, but most of it, you know,

429
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:34,360
I'm not going to draw my own
teeth and I do my own appendix.

430
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:35,770
I barely even clean my own house.
Right.

431
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,490
But once you get exposed to a vast
amount of contradictory information,

432
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,300
you realize just like we're all kind
of stupid and that's why we should be

433
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,460
humble and not order each other
around at the point of a gun,

434
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,110
which was so addicted to doing these days.

435
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,280
Transplant out a great quote about that,
about the bonfire of enlightenment,

436
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,900
the one the, as the bonfire of
enlightenment grows brighter,

437
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,910
the surface area of ignorance becomes
more illuminated and you realize the more

438
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:05,170
you learn, the more there is to
learn and then it becomes impossible.

439
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,720
Well, human knowledge doubles
every 18 months these days.

440
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,580
Like there's just no possibility that
anyone can be anywhere close to mastering

441
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:13,480
any, any significant. Yeah.

442
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,490
Well that's great though.

443
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:18,710
I think that's great because
I think there's a real
danger in claiming, you know,

444
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:22,200
and, and Clinton, that kind of
arrogance that comes from, uh,

445
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,460
especially very highly educated people
in specific areas of you very highly

446
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:27,660
educated in a specific area.

447
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,980
They oftentimes are arrogant about things
that they're ignorant about. And it's,

448
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:33,990
it's interesting to watch
that become an impossibility.

449
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,940
You're faced with such a massive
amount of data that's just online.

450
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:42,990
I'm like Twitter every day.
I'm exposed to dozens and dozens of

451
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,140
fascinating stories a
week or two in each one.

452
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,890
We, because we've got to, if we've got to
go up and make a buck or whatever, right?

453
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:51,050
But just love to dig into all this stuff.

454
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:52,700
And I'd love to learn
every language there is.

455
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:55,050
And I'd love to know every song
that was. Yeah, but you can't

456
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,710
at least a small grasp of what the
fuck they're talking about when they're

457
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:03,220
talking about quantum physics.
That's never gonna happen.

458
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,380
I think once you understand
quantum physics, it changes on it.

459
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,900
It's one of those things. Grab
fog. Fireman's quote was it?

460
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,250
If you think you understand quantum
physics and quantum physics, I,

461
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,100
I've read so many articles on it.
I don't know what

462
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,471
right it to someone,

463
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:19,910
they'll say this is the amazing
thing that just came out today,

464
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,080
but I don't know what it means.

465
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,610
Change at some geometric object that
explains the interactions of particles.

466
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,720
As long as my shoes,

467
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,660
them attending distracts that he'd
my feet because of some quantum flux.

468
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:32,660
I'm okay with it. I know it does
some creepy shit. Deep down.

469
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,990
I know that also read like by the time
it comes to the level of your sense like

470
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,840
it all cancels out and you, you know, this
is still going to be a table tomorrow,

471
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,230
but deep down in the roots of matters,
some really crazy shit is going on.

472
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,550
Yeah. Subatomic partners, apartments
blinking in and out of existence,

473
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,070
existing simultaneously,

474
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,280
two different places in motion and
still at the same time like what are you

475
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,780
talking to me?
We basically,

476
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:56,730
what they're saying is that the heart
of matter itself, the, the, the,

477
00:24:56,731 --> 00:25:01,700
the smallest measurable
portion of reality is magic.

478
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,840
I mean that's really, you
know, you're going to get
emails from physicists saying,

479
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,030
Oh, don't call it magic. It's not
magic. It's just the little confusing.

480
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,480
Thank you for correcting me and all.
I had magic to us.

481
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:14,610
But then these microphones
are kind of magic to me.

482
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,700
These little magic penises that record
everything we say. It's amazing.

483
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,810
I had Dr Amit Goswami on my podcast who's
one of the great quantum physicist of

484
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:28,040
our age who is just impossible
to understand. It mean it just,

485
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,210
he would just go,
it's gone so far into the bushes.

486
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,650
It's talking magic. And I mean
it's just, it's so strange.

487
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:41,651
But that is the accepted smallest
measurable part of the universe.

488
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,500
And it's amazing when you really started
to think about what we know about

489
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:48,680
nature and nature of being
fractal in so many different ways.

490
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,660
The universe itself being fractal.

491
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,580
And then when you get down to the
smallest measurable components of,

492
00:25:55,581 --> 00:26:00,581
of reality itself being this
strange fiction almost world,

493
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:06,050
it's so bizarre. It's impossible to
know everything. So I think this,

494
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,280
this, this age of enlightenment that we're
in right now is really unprecedented.

495
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:13,790
I don't think there's ever been a time
like this and once you break down the

496
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,450
narrative,
right?

497
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,590
So I mean my boring education's all the
history of philosophy and science and

498
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,450
you know, in the, in the, um,

499
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,360
the renaissance and the
enlightenment is when people said,

500
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,430
well God doesn't answer anything.
You know,

501
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:28,230
God is a barrier to [inaudible]
cause as long would you say God did.

502
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,200
It's like all right, we've
got an answer. I did it.

503
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,290
And then it becomes something that's
blasphemous, did the question.

504
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,700
And so when people began
to doubt the God thing,

505
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,910
then they began to be able to explore,
right? They began to say, okay,

506
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:44,070
well if God didn't do it, what the
hell did we get here? You know, what

507
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,380
is the world and what does the sun,
how does it work in all that?

508
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,580
I think we kind of get in there and
in a really painful, difficult way.

509
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,910
I think we're kind of getting there cause
we've knocked this narrative and it's

510
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,810
like in the future,

511
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:57,990
I guarantee you it's going
to be completely insane to
look back and say people

512
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,580
ever believe the shit. I mean, you know,

513
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,350
the guys who kept their own balls off
to go join that comment, you know,

514
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,720
you look back and just say it wasn't,
wasn't there. So someone said, you know,

515
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:10,590
when you're bringing out the pink and
sheers and taken off your tidy whities,

516
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,340
there's gotta be someone who's saying,

517
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,060
we were kind of going in
the wrong direction here.

518
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:17,950
But I think in the future I look
back at us like that and say,

519
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:18,784
what were they thinking?

520
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,610
Like we have these geographical areas
called countries and in those countries we

521
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,790
have a tiny group of people with all
the guns in the world and they tell

522
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:30,600
everyone else wanted to do. And somehow
we think this is going to work out fine.

523
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,100
I can't believe I wasn't recording.
I wasn't recording up until just now.

524
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Luckily I have to get the first, whatever,
27 minutes. We got it. There we go.

525
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,160
Folks who are listening to this will, will
normalize this years are the meatiest,

526
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,330
but the voice quality goes,
I'm considering, I suck
at technology. I'm sorry,

527
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,770
I can't believe that this
wasn't recording. But, uh,

528
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,930
again, Trayvon Martin, quantum physics.

529
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,650
Well, you know, that, that's where
we saw everything. We saw 27 minutes,

530
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,790
we had the whole fucking thing down.

531
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,790
Well, I'll, I'll, I'll make sure it gets
normalized. Um, but the, you know, the,

532
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,180
the, the, the, I think that the enormity
of the times we live in really, it's,

533
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,590
it's really easy for us
to not notice it or not.

534
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,320
It's so normal to just be able to
call some money on your cell phone.

535
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,530
So normal to able to get on the
Internet and just get information.

536
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,190
I think the enormity of
this as far as what is that,

537
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,610
what that's like in comparison
to having to go to the library,

538
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:32,240
into getting your education from a
school which you're getting, you know,

539
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,070
if you're taking science,

540
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:36,880
you're getting it from this professor
and this professor is going to remote

541
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,670
recommend these books and there may be
a completely opposing point of view that

542
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:44,390
you're never going to be exposed to.
Whereas if you Google something, you know,

543
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:49,190
and then Google that sprays and then
do bunked. Yeah. Know, man, I have,

544
00:28:49,191 --> 00:28:52,430
I can't tell you how many fucking times
I've had someone send me something and

545
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:56,600
then I'll say Google when you just sent
me and then debunked and then was talk

546
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,850
and if you haven't read that stuff,
got to talk to me.

547
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:01,280
Cause if you're only getting one side,
it's not any side at all.

548
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,810
Yeah, you're not, you're getting
this weird sort of confirmation bias,

549
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,660
see thing that exists.

550
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,920
What I've heard that argument as to
why the Internet is bad, that one,

551
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:15,590
one of the bad things about the internet
is you seek out like minded people and

552
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:19,070
you sort of confirm each other's
biases and get together and you know,

553
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,710
pat each other on the back sort of.
Yes.

554
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,730
But I feel like those are
just little camps, you know,

555
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:30,050
outside of the Wilderness of information,
which is New York City, you know,

556
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,651
like get my,

557
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:33,320
you might have a tent where all you
assholes get together and said that the

558
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:36,290
earth is 6,000 years old. Right.
But you know, you're, you're, uh,

559
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:40,970
an hour's walk from Manhattan,
right? You're not gonna,
you're not gonna survive.

560
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,040
Well,
I don't remember all

561
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,800
those people talking about a unity of
narrative and seeking out like minded

562
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:48,640
people really complaining about say the
Church that I grew up in or the public

563
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,440
school that I grew up in, Brian
was taught that, you know,

564
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,870
governments are necessary
beneficial, wonderful. And you know,

565
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:56,120
we fought the Second World War to defend
against national socialism and we won.

566
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:58,600
And like we had,
we already had that narrative.

567
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:00,460
Now people are fragmenting
into their own narratives,

568
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:04,510
but that's still way better than one
monolithic nonsense pile that we're all

569
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,410
supposed to in mind.
Right?

570
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,750
Yes. Yeah, I am. It's also
like as a human being,

571
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,780
what we have been given is this insane
amount of potential in the mind and in

572
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,950
the body's ability to
manipulate matter in nature.

573
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:25,070
But yet we don't have a real direction
book and we're sort of figuring out the

574
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,780
abilities of this mind and
the possibilities of, of,

575
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:35,100
of society and our interactions with
each other and the accumulation of

576
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:40,101
information that we can all rely on
each different aspect of our culture to

577
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:46,190
contribute. Whether it's, you know, a
history or science or mathematics or,

578
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,760
and all this stuff comes together and the
potential of it as almost unfathomable.

579
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,890
It's almost impossible to really truly
wrap our heads around and we only figure

580
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,680
out how to do things.
You write by trial and error,

581
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,830
we have to fuck up and then go,
well, we can't do that again.

582
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,910
And we have to drop a nuclear bomb and go,
well that's a disaster. And we have to,

583
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:10,200
you know, it's, we have this
incredible device, the human mind,

584
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,470
and we have very little idea of how to
utilize it properly or even less control

585
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:21,951
or engineer engineered thought into
how to develop people properly and,

586
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:23,720
and to,

587
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,720
to try to enforce that as a culture
or to recommend that or try to just,

588
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,850
I mean,
when you see the president on television,

589
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,370
what are they always deal with the
leader of the free world? Well,

590
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,660
they deal with conflict.

591
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,700
They're constantly dealing with conflict
and loss and finances and they're

592
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:45,540
dealing with all these things that are
important to people that are developed

593
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:49,830
and how much thought is actually given
to developing people. How much thought,

594
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:50,161
I mean,
how,

595
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:53,640
what does the last time you heard the
president United States talk about what we

596
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:58,641
really need to do is focus on the lowest
rung of our ladder with the weakest

597
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,770
link in our chain of human
beings and strengthen that.

598
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,490
Wouldn't we be a better country if we
had less losers, wouldn't we? I mean,

599
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:09,090
isn't that something we should concentrate
on, but it never gets brought up.

600
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,950
There's never talk about enriching poor
neighborhoods or setting up community

601
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:14,550
centers,

602
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:19,260
finding ways to help young
children that don't have guidance,

603
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,480
brilliant people and have fucking
companies like Halliburton funded.

604
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,050
You want to make a lot of money
rebuild Detroit, you know, fuck Iraq,

605
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:32,010
rebuild Detroit, fuck going to countries
and blowing them up and rebuilding them.

606
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,360
Concentrate on what's already fucked up
right here and it's never done. And it's,

607
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:39,860
it's, we, we, we look at it in terms of,

608
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,281
you know,

609
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:45,281
it's almost like going from going from
presidential run to presidential runs,

610
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,190
like these four year terms
that they do in a, in a way,

611
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:57,080
it's almost like the idea of having a
president and having these small four year

612
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:00,800
terms, it's like you're always
going to concentrate on what,

613
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:03,910
just problems as far as like
conflict and money here,

614
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:06,620
he's going to concentrate on what's on
the tip of people's tongues all the time,

615
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:09,620
but not on the engineering of society.

616
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,150
Yeah. It's, it's all here.
No prevention. Yes. Right.

617
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:15,180
So I'll just play whack a
mole with whatever fucking
crisis is coming up at the

618
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:19,770
moment and it's not how are we going to
make it so that society can be seen in

619
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:21,720
40 years.
They don't care about any of that stuff.

620
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,850
I mean that's why there's a national debt.
That's why this war,

621
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,560
because it's just about getting elected.

622
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,210
Like the of the Federal Reserve just said,

623
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:30,630
well we're going to keep buying
$85 billion worth of us treasuries.

624
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:33,030
Even though we said we were going to
stop because there's going to be an

625
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:36,180
election coming up. And what do they
care if they pass the bill to the unborn?

626
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,290
I mean they've gotta to be long gone.

627
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:41,280
So we have this weird society that
this these really narrow time slices,

628
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,110
which is just all about,
you know,

629
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:46,720
whack a mole and satisfying the noisiest
people and keeping those people too.

630
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,520
But the actual work of preventing
in the long run, which is so easy,

631
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:54,840
the science is so easy. It's so simple.
You know, reason with your children.

632
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:58,110
Don't hit your children's do treat them
like they're reasonable human beings.

633
00:33:58,111 --> 00:33:59,130
I mean,
I'm a dad of them.

634
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,140
I've been a stay at home dad
for like four and a half years.

635
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,920
Never had to raise my voice and my
daughter never had to yell at her,

636
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,850
never had to hit her,
never had to have a timeout.

637
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:09,990
We just reason things through that gets
not doing that about 18 months of age to

638
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:12,750
studies show that can stop the
reason they can start to negotiate.

639
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,740
And if we had that,
if we had that as a society,

640
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,010
I can virtually guarantee you there
would be almost no criminality.

641
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,621
I agree,

642
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:23,630
but don't you think that
there's an economic aspect
of that that really can't be

643
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,770
norm? You have the ability to
do that and very few people do.

644
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,460
That's the real issue is
that so many people do.

645
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:32,860
You have a working mom and
a working dad and the kids,

646
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:36,580
by the time they see their parents,
they mean they're ready to go to bed.

647
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I mean it's four or five o'clock at
night if they're lucky, you know,

648
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:43,030
most of the time they see their parents
afterwards. So it's six, seven, you know,

649
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,330
and they've been in there since eight
o'clock in the morning and they're

650
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:47,370
exhausted and everyone, they
got to feed them, bathe them.

651
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,490
They don't really have time for quality
interaction. It's very different

652
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,940
called the idea that
people have been sold,

653
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:57,470
that you can raise a child and have
a full career. I think it's madness.

654
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,390
It's kind of do it. You can't do it. Yeah.

655
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,370
And this idea that daycare just kind of
use you put him in daycare and that's

656
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:05,500
fine. Um, it's just not true. I mean,

657
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,680
statistically for actually scientifically
there kids who are in daycare from

658
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:11,770
other 20 hours a week experience exactly
the same symptoms as those who have

659
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:15,100
been abandoned by their mothers.
Like it's, it's the experience,

660
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:18,400
maternal abandonment at a very fundamental
level of changes their neurological

661
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:18,701
system.

662
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:22,120
It changes their stress responses to
changes that cortisol levels permanent,

663
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,160
that you measure it 10, 20 years
later. It's still the same.

664
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,760
So this idea that you can just
march, people have to work, hey,

665
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:29,410
it's great for the government.
I mean,

666
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:33,060
government loves it when both parents
work because then they got to taxes to tax

667
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:36,010
basis to tax capital out there,
spending money into the treasury.

668
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,860
Plus then they got to
put the kid in daycare.

669
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,710
So then there's somebody else who they
can tax, who's taking care of the kids.

670
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:44,010
So the government loves
it really. Absolutely. GDP
because everyone's working,

671
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:47,640
they get much more taxes and the
problems of having kids in daycare, well,

672
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:49,970
they get shuffled down to
the next generation and who
the hell do you know it's

673
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:53,390
about that gets done vote, right? Yeah.
But what's the solution to that? I mean,

674
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,810
it's going to be so difficult as a vice
sacrifice, you know? I mean, I mean,

675
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,720
people got a war,
you know what I mean?

676
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,200
Millions and millions of people went to
war in the Second World War in the first

677
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:07,360
world war. I mean marching into
hailstorms and bullets and,

678
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:11,310
and typhus and all that, going to
horrible stuff that went on. You know,

679
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:13,860
where we say to people, I say to people
all the time, you know, you know,

680
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,380
if you went to college,
you know you live like a dog.

681
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,980
He most people live like dogs when they
go to college for four years because it

682
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:23,550
was a good investment. Well, take that
same approach. If you want to have kids,

683
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,850
you don't both have to work, just
downsize, get rid of the second car.

684
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,480
Just we're not asking you to go
fight the Japanese, you know,

685
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,370
in some godforsaken island in the Pacific.

686
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,230
And it was just maybe
move to a smaller house,

687
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,600
moved to an apartment just a couple
of years when the kids, you know,

688
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,650
kids personalities, 90% done by
the time they're four, you know,

689
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,840
so all you got to do the first
couple of years, just sacrifice.

690
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:45,210
Have someone at home, breastfeed
your child, look at and say,

691
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:48,330
cause that's what nature
intended and sacrifice. You know?

692
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,980
So maybe you don't get the big screen TV,

693
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:52,950
but you will know what you get is like
a happy child throughout your life

694
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,010
and you get to develop a human being
in the correct way. Yeah, it's,

695
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,810
it's so easy for us to say, you
know, my wife is a stay at home wife,

696
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,060
stay at home mom and uh, you know,
we have three children and you know,

697
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,800
we're very fortunate and
everything works out great,

698
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,400
but I'm in a unique financial
situation that can happen.

699
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,980
Whereas I have a lot of friends
that are not in that situation.

700
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,400
They're trying to raise children and
they're also trying to put them in daycare

701
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,740
during the day.
And you know,

702
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,440
the wife just went back to work because
we have bills and this and that and you

703
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:26,850
see it and it's, it's not, it's not
the way a child wants to develop.

704
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,350
It doesn't seem healthy. No.
I mean historically, you know,

705
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,200
you put your kid in the backpack,
he went out and worked in the fields,

706
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,380
you go hunting, you bring your kid. I
mean, that's, they're supposed to be,

707
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,251
it's so weird,

708
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:40,450
the 21st century to say
children's supposed to be
with their parents and I'm a,

709
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,160
how would we ever drifted away that,
that even needs to be said, you know,

710
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:46,010
what do you think that is? Do
you think that's a, just a,

711
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,270
a desire from materialism and
some sort of a rationalization

712
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,750
that you can, uh, you can go after both,

713
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:58,160
that you can acquire all these things and
keep up with the Joneses and just have

714
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:01,640
someone else take care of the busy work
of taking care of your child when you do

715
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:02,540
that?
Is that what it is?

716
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,310
Yeah, I think, I think what happened was,

717
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,490
and this would have happened in the
sixties and seventies I sweat in the 50s

718
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:12,700
this whole amazing series of
labor saving devices came out,

719
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,060
which freed women from the drudgery of
dishwashers came out and laundry machines

720
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:20,080
and vacuum cleaners and all
that kind of stuff. Right?

721
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:23,800
So basically a huge amount of work
was done by machines now, which,

722
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,780
which freed up women. Then of course
a lot of them were like, okay, great,

723
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,860
I'm gonna go work for us or whatever.

724
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,700
But I think what's really
been downgraded is,

725
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,790
is the skills required to
be a good parent. I mean,

726
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,730
I've done some tough stuff in
life. I've built, built businesses.

727
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,850
I started this crazy show and all
that kind of stuff. Nothing. To me,

728
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,270
it's more exciting and challenging
than being a dad. I mean,

729
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,420
I know it's a cliche and it was
all it said was wonderful things,

730
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,650
but it really is an
incredible thing to do,

731
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,990
especially if you don't do
any of the aggression stuff.

732
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,270
Cause then you got to come up with
that other stuff. Right. Other ways of,

733
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,030
of dealing with conflicts, other ways
of dealing with quote bad behavior.

734
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
It's really challenging now if you just
spank and your kids and yelling at them,

735
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,130
I guess it's not that challenging
and hell of a lot. Not Fine. Right?

736
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,370
Because all you're doing is spending
your whole day trying to control someone

737
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,350
who doesn't want to be controlled.
That's not fun.

738
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,850
So I think that because we've got this
head Aman and put them in timeouts and

739
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,490
send them to bed without dinner
and yell at them or whatever.

740
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,800
I mean that's retarded. Anyone
could do that. You know,

741
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:19,000
you can get an angry robot to do that.
Right? But if you don't do that stuff,

742
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,530
then you have a really unique challenge
of negotiating with someone who's three.

743
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,440
I mean, how exciting is that? What
an incredible challenge that is.

744
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,440
But because we've still got the hitting
and the yelling and all of that,

745
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,770
it's retired. And so people say,
well, this is stupid and not fun,

746
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,670
so I'm going to go to work,

747
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,340
but it's only stupid or not fun
because you're yelling and hitting.

748
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,800
If you didn't do that and
it would be really engaged

749
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,850
it. And it's the most important
aspect of our society.

750
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:45,760
The most important aspect of our family
is the most important aspect of our

751
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,010
communities is developing
good human beings.

752
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,180
And it's one that we leave to everybody.
We'll just go work.

753
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,040
I know you fucked your whole life up,
but uh,

754
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:58,210
take care of this person and that person
will in turn transfer everything that

755
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:02,320
you've taught them and that any way that
you fucked them up or made them better

756
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,830
and they're going to go out into
the world and spread that energy.

757
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,210
And it literally changes the tone
of our entire society and culture.

758
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,650
And it's fascinating when
you see different cultures
all throughout the world.

759
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,880
If you study the, the, the different
ways they interact with their children,

760
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,950
how vastly different the,

761
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,690
the culture itself becomes because of
these styles of interaction and our

762
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:30,490
culture, which is thought to be
universally one of the most materialistic,

763
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:35,670
selfish child blood cultures is one of
the cultures that embraces this idea of

764
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:42,670
the, the two parents working the
childcare, the, you know, this,

765
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,031
this,

766
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:48,031
this idea of how we've decided to promote
becoming a human being is one of the

767
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,280
most awkward,
weird examples of it on earth.

768
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,880
Could you imagine, could you imagine
it's your anniversary, but ended,

769
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,480
you got married a couple
of years ago. You'd be with
your wife a long time, right?

770
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,900
Imagine it's your anniversary and she
calls you up and she says, Joe, you know,

771
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,700
it's our anniversary that
for a nice dinner. I got
babysitter and you say, Oh man,

772
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:13,900
I can't believe what a cliche. I
completely forgot. So sorry. Oh my God,

773
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:15,400
that's so embarrassing.
But I'll tell you what I'll do.

774
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,240
I'll call up someone we don't know and
I'm going to pay them minimum wage to go

775
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:26,350
out for dinner with you. Now they may not
speak great English, you know they mean,

776
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,700
I mean they've never met you before,

777
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,850
but I'm sure it's going to be pretty much
the same as going out for dinner with

778
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:31,870
me,
your ever loving husband.

779
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:35,210
So let me just make that
call to the agency to send
out some half broken English

780
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:37,880
speaking guy to go out for dinner with
you and it's going to be exactly the same.

781
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,030
She'd be like, no, it's not the same
because you don't, my husband is some guy,

782
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,010
I don't even know, but why the hell would
we think parenting is any different?

783
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,650
I mean how the hell you
replace the bond of,

784
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,770
of the new grew the bang and challenging
New Valley and you breastfeed the child

785
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:53,000
and you know that child.

786
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:57,020
But I'm sure some minimum wage stranger
who's rotating in and out of a job every

787
00:41:57,021 --> 00:42:00,860
four months is going to be exactly the
same as a parent. It's not the same.

788
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,830
And the consequences to society
a significant, and it's,

789
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,820
it's very frustrating to me
when I communicate with him.

790
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:09,860
People that are,
especially women that are single,

791
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,170
that are thinking about having
a child on her own. Uh, I've,

792
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:17,750
I've had so many as I could and I get it.

793
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,800
I get that they want a child and I get
that they want a child and that they

794
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:22,970
can't find a man.

795
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:25,580
I understand that it's hard to find
someone that you compatible with,

796
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,410
but God damn is that a terrible idea?
It works sometimes.

797
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,461
Sometimes it works.

798
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:34,790
Sometimes you get lucky and you meet
someone and somewhere along the line

799
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,950
some people fall out of the building.

800
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:40,660
And the way that doesn't mean that that
should be your next step engineered.

801
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,290
It's engineered that way. Those God
such a disaster statistically. Right?

802
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:50,291
I mean statistically and factually
there's no single worst predictor for kids

803
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,050
outcome then being from a
single mom household. You know,

804
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:56,150
and I hate to say it cause I mean again,

805
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:58,100
there's lots of single moms out there
really trying to do the right thing.

806
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,670
Some single moms like how he got hit
by a truck terror, you know, and they,

807
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:05,660
you know, all the support, all the, you
know, but the vast majority of it is,

808
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,240
you know, it didn't find the man
or just ditch the man or whatever.

809
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:10,940
And it is catastrophic for kids.

810
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:13,340
I mean the statistics are horrendous.

811
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,090
Like 80% of rapists come from
single parent households.
85% of murderers. I mean,

812
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,280
not again,
not that they all turned out that way,

813
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,590
but when you see these
significantly negative elements,

814
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,880
a lot of it gets traced back.

815
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,530
This is theory that says that is
kind of working this out fairly well.

816
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,540
They say that, um, if marriage rates
have stayed at the 1970 levels,

817
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,450
right, cause you know, marriage
rates are really low these days. Um,

818
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,490
and marriage not necessarily the same as,
you know,

819
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,920
two people committing to say
to get the mother, raise a kid,

820
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:44,810
but we would have almost no deficit in
government spending of marriage rates and

821
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:48,920
stayed as they did in 1970.
You know, when the majority,

822
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,080
vast majority of us got married,
stay married and so on.

823
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,680
Because marital disintegration, I mean,
getting a huge rise in welfare state,

824
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,500
huge and criminality costs huge rise in,
in uh,

825
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,550
every everything you can
think of in society that if
you trace back the deficit,

826
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,460
a lot of it has to do with this, this
breakdown of the family, which is,

827
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,920
I mean some people say it's
all engineered and Abi,

828
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,460
I don't credit the ruling class with
that much. Deviousness. Uh, but um,

829
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,710
I don't even know. So I did. It is,

830
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,950
it is something that is really
has to be talked about. I mean,

831
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,250
particularly for boys, I mean boys these
days are having a real rough, you know,

832
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:21,260
like the schools are really focused on,

833
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,860
on girls and how girls learn and
you know, boys, yeah. Oh yeah.

834
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,180
There's the huge change has been
a boys like to learn hands on.

835
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,230
They like to learn viscerally.

836
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:32,160
They don't like to just sit
there and read about stuff.

837
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:36,270
We'll see the teacher do stuff on
blackboards. And about 30 years ago,

838
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,560
a bunch of feminists said,
well,

839
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,290
girls are getting shortchanged in
school and it's all designed for boys.

840
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,640
And it's really shifted the curriculum.

841
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:44,700
And since then or has it been
just falling behind catastrophic?

842
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:49,560
Like so 60% of like, uh,
people in, in university does
and our girls and you know,

843
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,930
I think it's like nine times the number
of voids around these psycho tropic

844
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,830
brain killing meds are because they just,

845
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,720
the boys don't want to sit still all day,

846
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,770
but the society views girls as great
and boys is like broken girls. You know,

847
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:04,380
if we could just get them to be like
the girls and sit quietly and you know,

848
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:06,960
with their legs crossed and
all that. Uh, but why boys?

849
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:09,240
It just getting a real reference
school these days. And again,

850
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:10,860
because they're growing up without dads,

851
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,730
they don't have that role model of how
to channel that aggression. And so,

852
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:15,271
you know,

853
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:19,050
it's real rough and this is why they
just get medicated so rapidly and then it

854
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:21,110
escalates. You talked about
escalation escalates from there.

855
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:23,730
You get one drug for Adhd
and then you can't sleep.

856
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:26,700
So you get another drug for that and then
you start developing bipolar symptoms,

857
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:28,370
you get another drug for that.
And that all went down.

858
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:31,200
I think he's getting so kind of you get
another drag for that next thing you

859
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:33,540
know, living in a facility for the
rest of your life. It's masters

860
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,820
and that's a huge issue in the society.

861
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:40,080
The amount of money and the amount
of influence that pharmaceutical drug

862
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:44,650
companies have a our society, the fact
that this money is something that they,

863
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:45,630
they count on.

864
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,470
This is money that has been coming in
and once you have a corporation that's

865
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,470
used to acquiring wealth
or we have a bottom line,

866
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:55,530
this is what we make and why we're
making less now, why would it be no,

867
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,430
they're not going to step in and say,
listen, I think we be better for society,

868
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,040
society so that we earn
less money smoking crater.

869
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,920
But that CEO is and someone else
has to be is going to do that.

870
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,990
Whether you talked about
this in the show yesterday,

871
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,630
guess a gator roll oh data role. When
you're a gator grabs a hold of its prey.

872
00:46:13,631 --> 00:46:14,464
They roll.

873
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,101
But yeah,

874
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:19,330
I'm not going to a big clarity cause you
gotta see this and I gotta tell you I

875
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:22,660
was haunted by that when I drive.
I like the idea of you spinning around.

876
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:28,500
It's like, oh my God, there's
not enough in the world.

877
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,250
We see them alligator bite
on to a, yeah, they spin,

878
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,460
they were seeing and they try and rip
it out of the joint down on the side or

879
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:37,294
something.

880
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,660
That's how the Ted is not helping my
mental image to think of your mental image

881
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,820
with an alligator next.

882
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,160
That's this whole kind of people who don't
know my job or like what the fuck are

883
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:47,850
they talking about? But go see it
because it's worth breaking it. But,

884
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,390
but you had to scrape it
when you're talking, talking

885
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,090
about like it's pharmaceutical companies.
Well you know,

886
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:54,880
try masturbating and
with pot and stay awake.

887
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,390
But I think that's something else
too, which is that, you know,

888
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,950
why is tobacco legal and part is
not? Well, as it never discussed,

889
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,510
it just kills 5,000 people in there.

890
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,870
And because tobacco is a factory farm
product part, you can grow at home, right?

891
00:47:07,871 --> 00:47:11,290
So if you enable people to self medicate,
you know,

892
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,300
and I don't mean that in a bad
way, but to self medicated, right?

893
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,580
Like you having trouble sleeping,
I smoke a bit of part and you fall asleep,

894
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:18,370
right? You can grow that shit
at home, in your basement,

895
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:20,950
in your backyard or whatever.
There's no profit to anyone.

896
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,350
So that stuff like the
stuff you can grow tobacco,

897
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:26,460
you can't grow tobacco in your backyard.
Will you be affected for tobacco?

898
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,200
You wouldn't have to have a license
to do so. Right, right, right.

899
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:30,010
It's not like you can grow

900
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,680
tomatoes,
like you can grow your own tomatoes,

901
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:35,560
but when you deal with anything
that affects your consciousness,

902
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,890
you have to have, uh, uh, you know,

903
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,360
the government has to step
in and allow you to do so,

904
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,860
which is we can just make your own ooze.
Oh, right, right. Your own moonshine.

905
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,650
Isn't it elite? I mean, this has
got to be some sort of regulations.

906
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,310
It's like you can, you craft beer
making, right? But how does that work?

907
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,443
Do you have to?

908
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,910
Well I think as long as you don't sell it,

909
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:56,340
I mean I think you can make your
own stuff at home or whatever,

910
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:59,130
but I think that tobacco, you
need like a big, you know,

911
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,490
certain only certain places and a big
crop and stuff like that and process that

912
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:04,120
you just really hyper as pot use grow,
it's not.

913
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,660
So I think it would be really tough,
you know,

914
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,020
cause we measure economic
productivity this weird way, you know,

915
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:13,530
like if someone gets sick that GDP
goes up. Like how is that same?

916
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,580
I mean surely it's sickness,

917
00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:17,880
it's a bad thing that you shouldn't
reflect a negative result. But you know,

918
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:20,010
they go spend a lot of money on
treatments and suddenly he's like woo,

919
00:48:20,011 --> 00:48:22,140
we're richer. You know?
And, and so same thing,

920
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:26,220
if you then have people smoking
pot but they ground themselves,

921
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,930
your GDP is going to take a huge crater.

922
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,550
And then all these people that
are going to be out of work,

923
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,900
who's supplying all this horrible
stuff to people and so on. And I mean,

924
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,260
the way we measure stuff now,

925
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,470
I mean it's just completely as
forces everyone into these really,

926
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:38,610
really bad decisions.

927
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,543
Yeah.
I wonder,

928
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,810
one of the things he said that I really
agree with about how boys are so much

929
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:46,750
different than girls, uh,
when it comes to learning.

930
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,500
I just recently started volunteering
at my daughter's school and she's in

931
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:55,070
kindergarten and I watch boys.
Do you volunteer like these?

932
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,970
They have these tables
set up and you have to,

933
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,450
everyone has to put together this little
book and cut these pieces out and put

934
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:05,710
it in order and you watch boys do it
as opposed to girls and they're sturdy.

935
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,590
They're a different animal.
I mean it's a completely different thing.

936
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,960
They are almost like they're there.

937
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,810
They're so challenged like the
girls can just do, do, do, do,

938
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:16,890
do it nicely and humming
to themselves and attend.

939
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,650
These aren't the hunting and the lines
and that they're barely paying attention

940
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:24,220
to what's going on. They want to run, they
want to go do something. And it's like,

941
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,670
that's how I felt growing up.
I always felt like,

942
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,780
I can't wait for this fucking bell rang
so I can run outta here. Yeah. And it,

943
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,310
I thought at the time,

944
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:36,670
well obviously I'm not very smart and
I'm not going to be good at school and it

945
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:41,080
wasn't that at all. But what it
was was I am not designed for this.

946
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,010
Like there is a society and this society
has a broad spectrum of human beings

947
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,090
and we have various tasks that we will
do and we will be really good at and

948
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:52,820
we'll have different occupations that
we can choose and different one suit,

949
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:53,860
different personalities,

950
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:57,160
but this fucking cookie cutter
shit that they do in school,

951
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:01,570
they want everyone to be the same way
because that's all they have money for.

952
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,520
That's all we have resources for.
We have,

953
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:07,500
we have the ability to stick you in
this class from 9:00 AM to whatever,

954
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,820
2:00 PM and do this stuff
and then you know, we,

955
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:14,590
we need you to listen and then you go
and then you leave and we'll give you a

956
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:19,110
grade on it. And it's madness. The idea
of that as an educational backbone, that,

957
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:22,720
that, that has an educational foundation
for a human being. It's madness. No

958
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,390
nothing to give to their
history. You know, there's,

959
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,360
there's two things that are best, the
best predictors of empathy, right?

960
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:31,760
Empathy is what we really,
really need as a species.

961
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:34,040
Like we're fucked with that empathy
because we've got these weapons of mass

962
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:34,551
destruction,

963
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:38,030
we got to do your weapons and we go like
if we don't really work on empathy is

964
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:40,160
the most important resource.
So the question is how do you grow it?

965
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,360
Two things seem to Kim come up on the top
of the list for how to grow up empathy.

966
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,520
Uh, I would never have guessed them,
so I'm like, let's get a driver.

967
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,940
And the two things that,
that rice at the top,

968
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:53,000
when it comes to developing empathy,
number one, the presence of a father.

969
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,451
Isn't that interesting?

970
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,900
Because men are considered to be less
empathetic and women are more empathetic.

971
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,750
Presence of the father is the number one
predictor of their further development

972
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:04,330
of empathy. Number two, it's free
plate in nature, free play in edge.

973
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:05,870
And my daughter's really
into this right now.

974
00:51:05,871 --> 00:51:08,900
Like we have toads that live by our house,
so we have a froggy pardon,

975
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,140
I'm far away. And she's learning
a lot about how to handle things,

976
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,540
delicately had a play with them
and all of that. She's great,

977
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:18,290
great with the animals and frequently
in nature and the presence of a father.

978
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,650
Now what's happened over the
past 40 years and as society,

979
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,990
kids don't get free
play in nature anymore.

980
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,450
Most of it's scheduled shit in the gym,
you know,

981
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:28,850
with the dance classes and
all that thrombus that was,

982
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,870
but give them free play in nature of
the glorious anarchy of childhood where

983
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:33,830
it's just like he doesn't have
to do and go do something. Right.

984
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,480
That's number one.
And number two,

985
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:38,780
of course it's dads and vanished
from so many households.

986
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,760
And this is why in the last 15 years
sociopathy one of the most malignant forms

987
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:47,720
of distractive personality
traits, sociopath, he has
doubled in the last 15 years.

988
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,340
I'm not sure what that term means. What
sociopathy, uh, people who, um, uh,

989
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,410
grandiose zero conscience,

990
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:58,670
they use other people there superficially
charming but never keep their promises.

991
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:01,970
So especially if they have no,
they have no conscience at all.

992
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:03,200
And then we'll know measurable conscience,

993
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:06,710
like you can show that the most horrifying
stuff where you and I is our brains

994
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:10,160
would light up like Christmas trees.
Right? And they just, they don't care.

995
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:13,910
They don't have any particular, and
this is doubled in our society, uh, to,

996
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:18,800
to the point when Alec Between One and
25 and one in 20 people are sociopaths.

997
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,130
I mean that's tens of direct correlation
between that growing up with a father

998
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,700
and not being, well, those
are two significant risk
factors. There's other stuff,

999
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:29,100
you know, physical abilities, how
do they calculate and all that.

1000
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:33,050
So they just find sociopath and work
backwards, back end what they do big,

1001
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,650
you know, the big studies, uh,

1002
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,880
and they asked people all of the
questions and sociopath's filled reliant,

1003
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,660
you'd get stuff wrong because they just
don't have empathy. They can fake it,

1004
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:43,730
you know,
they kind of know that's what's expected,

1005
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,760
but they don't actually feel
empathy for other people.

1006
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:48,710
And you can find that with
a series of questions.

1007
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:51,890
You can also measure their brains and
find out how they react to certain stimuli

1008
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,960
and how it's different for
the rest of the population.

1009
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,430
And they do big studies on that.

1010
00:52:55,431 --> 00:52:57,770
And then they extrapolate that
to the population as a whole.

1011
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:02,450
We were talking about Fm Ris, uh, on
the, before this recording started,

1012
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,110
he was gripping. Shit,
we've got another crappy,

1013
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,110
we audio engineer and put it all together.

1014
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:12,030
But the fascinating thing about Fmis,

1015
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:16,280
being able to measure various aspects
of the brain and reactions to certain

1016
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:19,640
things, um, on my television
show and have you ever seen it?

1017
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:21,840
It's called Joe Rogan
questions. Everything. Well,

1018
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:23,810
one of the things we did was watching.
We've talked to,

1019
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:26,030
can you want a new word rather?
It's beautiful thing.

1020
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,850
It's actually from that finding
bigfoot show there. Yeah.

1021
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,160
Yeah. Talking about it long
before my show, but we, um,

1022
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,390
I spoke to a woman who is a,
an,

1023
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,660
she was an expert on,
uh,

1024
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:42,090
use of the EEG and Mri and she said that
there was actually a court case where a

1025
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:46,920
woman was convicted because she had
functional knowledge of a crime scene and

1026
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:49,200
it's based on Fsri wow.

1027
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,730
That she had functional knowledge of
a murder scene and the woman who was a

1028
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:58,590
neurologist felt that it was very
dangerous because she said there can be

1029
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:02,940
functional knowledge of something based
on how much have they talked to you

1030
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:05,880
about this crime scene.
Have you formulated imagery in your head?

1031
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,770
Have they shown you
photographs of the scene?

1032
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,380
How do they like what places
and how do we know what,

1033
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,420
what aspect of it relies on personal
creativity or the imagination to sort of

1034
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:21,711
conceive him and played out in your head
and then that this is registered on the

1035
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,600
FM awry.
It's fascinating,

1036
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:28,050
fascinating stuff where we're getting
to really understand the various

1037
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:30,330
components of what makes us a human being.

1038
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,710
What memory is really tricky. Do
you, do you have these things?

1039
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:33,420
I have these things,
Joe,

1040
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,210
where like I had stories about
my childhood and I swear to God,

1041
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,800
I could not tell you if they're true or
not. I don't know if I heard that story.

1042
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:46,830
Somebody told it so many times now I
don't know if I'm in France and there's a

1043
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,580
rep half of the planet or Deborah, I
mean I'm not sure. Like I don't know.

1044
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,710
I did the stories like, oh, I
remember when you did this and I mean,

1045
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,600
I don't know if it got
extrapolated or it got nec.

1046
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,330
I don't honestly know like you know,
pictures of it. It didn't happen.

1047
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,020
But I don't know. And I think that's
true for a lot of people like you,

1048
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,200
you can tell you talk
yourself in and how to stuff.

1049
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:07,930
They did a study recently that blew my
mind about people's ethical integrity,

1050
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,380
right?

1051
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:13,380
So they did a study where they got
people to agree with a particular ethical

1052
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:16,910
statement. I agree with
this ethical statement ever
abortion is bad or whatever.

1053
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:20,650
They get ethical state and then they
had them close the book and then they,

1054
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,060
the book stuck a new word that made
it exactly the opposite statement.

1055
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,500
Right. And now agree with this thing
that I formally condemned as the youth.

1056
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,490
Right.
They opened it up and they ask them,

1057
00:55:30,491 --> 00:55:32,320
can you just read that again
and tell us what you think?

1058
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:37,810
About 70 to 80% of the people would read
it again and completely agree with the

1059
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:41,350
exact opposite statement that they've
made, not three minutes before.

1060
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,230
And had great reasons
for it too. Wow. I mean,

1061
00:55:44,231 --> 00:55:48,610
this is the level of fluid unreality
that people live in and it's really

1062
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:49,990
dangerous and we all live in.
Yeah.

1063
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,820
And we all have to fight
this tendency for sure.

1064
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:52,091
Well,

1065
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:55,630
I've had real issues with people when
you talk to them about past events and

1066
00:55:55,631 --> 00:55:59,350
they start giving it an incredibly
distorted, self-serving version of it.

1067
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,750
And I wonder whether or not they really
believe this or not. And then I'm,

1068
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,450
I'm really,
um,

1069
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:08,380
I'm a big proponent of
if I criticize something,

1070
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,880
I criticize myself first because I think
that if I criticized the various aspect

1071
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:17,590
of human nature, like memory, my memory
is fantastic and yet fucking terrible.

1072
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:21,460
You know, I can go like when I do
the ultimate fighting championship,

1073
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,250
when I do the broadcast for
the fights, I, you know, I can

1074
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,780
run a law statistics. You are, um, you
are great with names. Thank you. Yeah,

1075
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:29,220
no you are.

1076
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,190
Because for me people might as well just
introduce themselves to me with like,

1077
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,330
Hello Andrew. Angela. Cause that's all
I got. Three minutes. Same concept.

1078
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:38,550
But you just like Blah Blah remains just
trip off of your time. And I think grab,

1079
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,280
well especially when it comes to like
mixed martial arts or something that I'm

1080
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:45,760
passionate about, I can remember details
of fights, very important things.

1081
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:49,660
But like last night,
last night show was amazing.

1082
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:54,460
I've been looking forward to it for a
longest time as a rod to be part of like

1083
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:58,090
that was a killer chef. Oh, it's real.
A lot of fun. So it's 3000 people.

1084
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:02,770
I'm on stage for an hour and 20 minutes
and if you had access to my memory of

1085
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:06,480
that night,
it would be blurry snap shots.

1086
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:12,190
Remember Hacivat oh yeah. Did I do that
job? I don't remember if I did that. Joe.

1087
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:16,450
I have notes.
I mean I have it in the moment.

1088
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,060
If you can remember it too well
and you were watching yourself.

1089
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:23,440
You weren't in it. Yes, but it's,
but it's a huge event for me.

1090
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:28,450
Important once a year thing where I come
to Toronto and yet my memory of it is

1091
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:32,260
this incredibly cloudy thing
and it's like that is the case.

1092
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:35,440
I think with most human beings when it
comes to memory and we were looking at,

1093
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:40,360
we look at memory and we try to pretend
as if my memory is locked solid,

1094
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,290
you know, it's, it's in there. I
bolted in, it's screwed in place. Yeah,

1095
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,070
it's not going anywhere. And that's
nonsense. The mind doesn't work that way.

1096
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,960
There's various things you can remember.

1097
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:54,610
I remember how to use this
espresso machine and pushed
a little carton in there.

1098
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:58,850
I press that button and the junk
comes out. But you know, the, the,

1099
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,880
the reality of my day, like what
went on today, it's just snapshots,

1100
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:07,330
like weird flashbacks of food,
Iaa,

1101
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:12,010
jokes that we tell them. It's
very strange, the human mind.

1102
00:58:12,011 --> 00:58:17,011
I think one of the emerging aspects of
technology that I'm incredibly fascinated

1103
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:20,530
with is this symbiotic relationship
that we're starting to have with,

1104
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,920
with computers, machines, Google glass.

1105
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,450
I think we're going to develop an
artificial way of recording things or an

1106
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,310
artificial way of recording
life that's going to be like,

1107
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:31,840
I'm going to be able to, you know, Stefan,

1108
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:36,100
please check out my day and drop off my
day and you're going to roll with like,

1109
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:38,080
Holy Shit, why don't you fucking
terrified in this as well.

1110
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:41,730
This is a crazy moment. Like
what? We won't be able to
call each other I man. Yeah.

1111
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,860
It'd be a little bit fast
forward into this lives and,

1112
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:46,460
and share what you know that

1113
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:50,640
a bunch of lawyers and trying to get in
touch with the NSA these days because

1114
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,380
the NSA records everything. Right?
And so they're saying, look,

1115
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:58,250
I mean for my court case,
you guys know his cell phone was here,

1116
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:01,400
but he was talking on it and they say
he was here, but then sell a company,

1117
00:59:01,401 --> 00:59:03,320
doesn't have records.
Go back two years. You,

1118
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,670
you guys can get this guy had a Jane
doe and the freedom of information acts.

1119
00:59:07,671 --> 00:59:10,400
They're just hammering these guys trying
to get facts out to get people out of

1120
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:11,540
jail or put people in jail.

1121
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,460
I think they don't want to really
completely admit that they are recording

1122
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:18,310
everything. I mean, when Obama
addressed that situation,

1123
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,130
it's easier to record everything. And then
some things. What if we applied this on

1124
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,340
and off when he said something important?
We were just recording about a data.

1125
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:30,080
It's not a concern. We're not
spying on Americans. Yeah, yeah.

1126
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,310
The fuck you're not man.

1127
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:35,000
They're spying on everyone and they're
putting it all in these gigantic hard

1128
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:37,930
drugs and the APP.
No,

1129
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:41,150
I mean hydride spaces so cheap now,
but I've always lived like, it's all,

1130
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:44,270
it's being recorded ever since I
went online. Smart. Oh, come on.

1131
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,990
It makes a smart way to do it. And
it's showing now at this point in time,

1132
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:51,470
but that is if you send something,
if you transmit something,

1133
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,980
someone can receive it. If
someone can pick it up, someone
can enter, intercept it.

1134
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,940
It's a, it's a very strange aspect, but
again, as as we were talking about before,

1135
00:59:58,941 --> 00:59:59,774
I think it,

1136
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:04,460
we are in an adolescent stage of this
relationship that we have to technology in

1137
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:06,440
this relationship that
we have to information.

1138
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,010
I think ultimately it's going to get
to a point where there is no boundary

1139
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:12,170
between your information
or my information.

1140
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,980
And I think with that really gets weird
is with money because money essentially,

1141
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:20,060
right now it's just ones and Zeros
and when you get down to this,

1142
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:25,170
there's a finite point of this finite
barrier and that barrier breaks and there

1143
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:29,390
is no, there's no boundary
between anyone in information.

1144
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:33,800
Mine is just information. It can start
getting really fucking weird. Yeah.

1145
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:36,880
Money is agreed bullshit.
It is. It's like that's,

1146
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:40,100
both will give me this bullshit and real.
Right. That's how churches get built.

1147
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:44,750
Yeah. But money is just
this complete fiction as you
pointed out. I mean, you know,

1148
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:46,040
it used to be used to be old.

1149
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,900
It used to be some stuff you
had to dig out of the ground.

1150
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:51,160
You couldn't just make it up like that.
Right. But the main effect buying this,

1151
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,200
you mentioned $85 billion worth of
treasuries. They didn't have that money.

1152
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,450
It's not like they went
out and made it out. Man,

1153
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:59,840
that was a long shift at the weight at
the pizza had to get those tips, man.

1154
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:00,380
They just,

1155
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,780
they type whatever they want into their
bank account and we don't think that's

1156
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:06,650
going to corrupt human beings. I
mean Kippy a breath. It's so strange.

1157
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,410
It's so strange.
And W we,

1158
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,420
we live in the weirdest time when it comes
to money as well because of the whole

1159
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:16,340
collapsing the banks and the bailouts
and the president getting on television

1160
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,780
and saying he's going to limit the Ala,

1161
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:23,830
the guys who we bailed out and he's going
to limit their fucking bonuses to half

1162
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,300
a million dollars. And we're like,
what? Where's that money coming from?

1163
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,640
Is that all our money? You're going to
take our money? Who are you to give it to?

1164
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:35,660
These guys, it's a bonus for
failing, like the banks failed.

1165
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:38,750
And so they get a boat.
Like what are you saying?

1166
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:42,080
Like what is this madness we're living?
Well, Obama of course, you know,

1167
01:01:42,081 --> 01:01:45,200
there's some theories that the, one of
the main reasons he got elected, he took,

1168
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,660
he took the most money at all
the candidates from Wall Street,

1169
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,740
from the financial companies. And I mean,
what's he gonna do? Throw them in jail?

1170
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,220
Like they just did this fine.
I think it was yesterday, um,

1171
01:01:55,490 --> 01:02:00,440
at JP Morgan got hit with a fine of
$920 million. Right? And first of all,

1172
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,380
that's just bail out money.
They're handing back, you know,

1173
01:02:02,381 --> 01:02:05,660
the boob burning money here. You, oh,
it's back. Right? But secondly, I mean,

1174
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,600
let's say that they did, they seem to
have admitted to some legal stuff, right?

1175
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,910
So they did the legal stuff,
which costs their clients a lot of money,

1176
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,010
or the client's getting the money back.
No government gets it.

1177
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,180
It's like phoning the cops and say,
somebody stole my car. The Cop said, we,

1178
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,620
we found it. Are we gonna keep it,
but we found it. I mean, government,

1179
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:20,310
why would the government

1180
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,100
get the money for what JP Morgan
did to ripoff it's customers.

1181
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,220
Plus the JP Morgan employees aren't
going to get racist because I mean,

1182
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,730
but the JP Morgan executives, they
don't pay anything. It's a corporation.

1183
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:30,780
I mean they can't pay,

1184
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:33,950
I mean the corporation is just this
abstract fiction that people make up that

1185
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,750
shield themselves from legal consequences.
So everyone's like,

1186
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,250
oh well they got fine. So they, you know,

1187
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:40,950
somehow the JP Morgan executives
are out that money and it's like,

1188
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:44,160
no they're not. I mean they're never
going to get thrown in jail for anything.

1189
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,343
Never,

1190
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:50,060
never going to get thrown in jail for
things that the average person would be

1191
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:54,260
locked up for the rest of their life
if they were involved in fraud at that

1192
01:02:54,261 --> 01:02:57,140
level, if they were involved.
I mean just think about,

1193
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,920
just think about what when people go to
jail for just for what they do with the

1194
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:07,410
stock market for manipulation, the stock
market. I mean that is essentially a,

1195
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:12,020
how much different is that really?
Then what goes on with the banking crisis?

1196
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,420
I mean,
you're talking about moving money around,

1197
01:03:14,421 --> 01:03:17,930
you talking about manipulating things
and figuring out a way to profit from

1198
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:20,060
these manipulations. Yeah. How is,

1199
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:23,180
how was insider trading any different
from what these guys have done?

1200
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,520
Well, it's not any, I mean,

1201
01:03:24,521 --> 01:03:26,650
if you want to talk about
manipulating the stock market,

1202
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,180
I mean the Federal Reserve buying the
treasury bonds just because nobody else

1203
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:34,640
wants those pieces of shit frankly. Right?
I mean, the Chinese are sick of them.

1204
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,250
The Indians,
it's a sick of them.

1205
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:39,280
The Japanese are sick of them because
they know that they can't possibly be

1206
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:42,390
redeemed without hyperinflation
or some other defaults. Right.

1207
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,920
As either a software heart, he thought
they know that that stuff is junk.

1208
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:48,040
So the Fed is buying them just to prop
up the prices and they're doing that.

1209
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:50,740
So all the other governments don't have
to admit that they're basically toilet

1210
01:03:50,741 --> 01:03:53,550
paper's in Bob Wheaton, you know,
Donald Mill toilet paper. Yeah.

1211
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:57,440
And it's all just this crazy thing
that they can't possibly sustain.

1212
01:03:57,441 --> 01:04:02,270
You know that this show, once they'd
been about 240, like just paper,

1213
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:05,540
only coffee accounts, right? Paper
only money in a history of the world.

1214
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,580
240 240 different ones, different, just
different, you know, they, you know,

1215
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,340
some government gets in power,
the issue,

1216
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:14,750
some bullshit currency and then it
blows up and then they issue some new

1217
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:15,584
currency,
whatever.

1218
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:19,430
And there's only one of them that's
still in circulation from a couple of

1219
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,360
hundred years ago.
It's the British pounds though.

1220
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:24,680
It's last like 97% of its value in the
dollars last like 98% of it's value since

1221
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:29,270
the Fed came in in 1913. Uh,
and um, and people say gas,

1222
01:04:29,271 --> 01:04:33,500
it's expensive. It's not, if you guess
it's cheaper now than it was in 1960.

1223
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:35,520
If you pay for it and silver,
if you pay for it.

1224
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:38,060
And this paper a shit that the
hand around pretending it's money,

1225
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:40,400
it's really expensive because
it's been devalued so much.

1226
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:44,180
When I first came to Canada in
1977 I was like 11 years old.

1227
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:48,610
I can get a candy bar for it now.
You don't now and within like 10 years.

1228
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,410
So it was like a buck because they're
just printing all this crazy money.

1229
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:54,410
Printing money is a great gig because
you get to hand it out to all the people

1230
01:04:54,411 --> 01:04:57,380
who are voting for you and then the
inflation hits like two years later and

1231
01:04:57,381 --> 01:04:59,090
nobody can connect the dots.
It's beautiful.

1232
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,720
And plus everyone blames
the local supermarket for
raising the prices as if they

1233
01:05:02,721 --> 01:05:06,500
want to write. But it's all the central
printing money stuff is just really,

1234
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,860
really dangerous. And it brought down the
Roman empire was exactly the same way.

1235
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:13,390
They just kept putting more and more crap
into their money until what was Sylvan

1236
01:05:13,391 --> 01:05:15,110
and areas which originally 100% silver.

1237
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,980
It ended up being like one and a half
percent silver with basically like,

1238
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:21,910
you know, Zombie teeth, that
Harish shit thrown into it. Right?

1239
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,970
And it just destroys the entire,
the entire economy.

1240
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:27,400
And this is going to have to be this
huge reset and the global economy.

1241
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,320
So what's,
how is that?

1242
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:30,203
I'm going to happen.

1243
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:35,160
I mean w w what's fascinating is that now
that we have this incredible access to

1244
01:05:35,161 --> 01:05:37,320
information and now that you know,

1245
01:05:37,321 --> 01:05:40,870
people like you were putting
this stuff out there and it's,

1246
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,130
it's become a part of the narrative.
People understand what's wrong.

1247
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:48,030
It's not just a matter of it goes wrong
and it takes years for people to put the

1248
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,300
pieces together and then you have to
go to school and learn what's wrong.

1249
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:54,330
It's really right in front of your
face. What's wrong? What happens now,

1250
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,980
do you think that there's
an adjustment period?

1251
01:05:55,981 --> 01:05:58,810
Do you think that because of this ink,

1252
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:02,520
this incredible
groundswell of information,

1253
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:07,170
do you think that it can be re engineered?
Can it be redesigned? Can it, can we,

1254
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,720
can we somehow or another
bitcoin our way out of it?

1255
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,670
Well, there's a long term solution
which I think is multigenerational,

1256
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,480
which has to do with
treating kids batterer right?

1257
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:18,330
Raising them rationally and not using
aggression on them and all that.

1258
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,510
So there's a long term solution. I mean,
the short term solution I think is just,

1259
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:21,901
you know,

1260
01:06:21,901 --> 01:06:25,800
trying to invest in human capital and
try and convert paper currency into

1261
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:28,740
something tangible like real estate
or gold or something like that.

1262
01:06:28,741 --> 01:06:31,650
I think those are sensible strategies
that lots of people who've been on my show

1263
01:06:31,651 --> 01:06:35,100
and all the economists will talk about.
I think that's all good stuff. Um,

1264
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,840
I think what's going to happen in the
short run is obviously the government's

1265
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,020
going to run out of money. I mean,
no matter how much they print,

1266
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,070
they're just going to run out of money.

1267
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:46,490
And then what happens is there's
going to be talk a sacrifice now,

1268
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:48,930
not the kind of sacrifice
like forget the second car,

1269
01:06:48,931 --> 01:06:50,670
stay home with your kids that
we've been talking about before,

1270
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,220
but like real hard and sacrifice.
So they're gonna say, well,

1271
01:06:53,221 --> 01:06:56,070
we spent the on remains for
so long. You've seen this
happened before in history.

1272
01:06:56,071 --> 01:06:58,220
And they just basically turn
on the dependent classes, they,

1273
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:02,610
of welfare recipients to live on less
social security recipients who live on

1274
01:07:02,611 --> 01:07:06,210
less and they're just start squeezing
the dependent classes because that's the

1275
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:08,520
biggest single bail. And
also you'll, you will see,

1276
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,950
which of course is the goal of
a lot of overseas terrorists.

1277
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:15,340
You will see the u s begin to withdraw
the imperial presence in the world. Right?

1278
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,080
They got over 700 military bases all over
the world. That's an expensive stuff.

1279
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:23,850
Is that really the number now? Seven over
700 I think 720 now. That's incredible.

1280
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,460
Oh, it's crazy. When we talk
about like the Roman Empire,

1281
01:07:26,461 --> 01:07:28,930
when people talk about getting
this con constantly in the world,

1282
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:33,670
like it was nothing. Okay, this guy was
basically just a fuck machine. You know,

1283
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:36,720
like I took a third of people in that
section of the world can trace their

1284
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:39,570
lineage back to that guy. I mean he
was working overtime and he like,

1285
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,740
he never did the gate of all.

1286
01:07:40,741 --> 01:07:43,260
I think that by trying to
say it was pretty amazing.

1287
01:07:43,261 --> 01:07:44,960
When you think about how
much damage they did though,

1288
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:48,840
you really will read or listen to Dan
Carlin show hardcore history. Yeah,

1289
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:51,450
he's been on my show actually. Yeah,
he's got a great show. Great Guy.

1290
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:53,580
He's his piece on the con,

1291
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,990
the wrath of the cons with
five part piece. Um, the, the,

1292
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,760
the incredible accomplishments
of Ganga scars.

1293
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:05,990
Mongol hoards, no. Yeah,
they're responsible for the
death of at least 20 million,

1294
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:09,110
perhaps 70 million people
like depending on the ass.

1295
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:13,200
How over the course of his lifetime
and the lifetime the sons like

1296
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,040
that's the bad shit man forces pad

1297
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,450
stuff, horses, horses, arrows, the killed
at least 20 million people. I mean that,

1298
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,210
I mean, once you're on hook in
a while, like that's a lot of,

1299
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,410
you haven't tried pulling a boat.

1300
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,220
I mean those are real close
to the of the compound. Yeah.

1301
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:30,490
Those clothes would acquire 160
pounds of pressure to pull. Yeah.

1302
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:34,150
I mean like at one point you just give
him a fucking arm flies off, you know,

1303
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,320
that you don't even like,
it doesn't even shoot an arrow anymore.

1304
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:37,940
You're just arm goes
across like a boomerang.

1305
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,110
I don't know what you do at that point.

1306
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:43,000
And they had women that could pull those
bolts and shoot from a horse like that.

1307
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:47,360
A Bullseye while you're awesome thundering
along. I mean also shoots sideways,

1308
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,250
talked under the Horse. Oh, right, right.

1309
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:51,820
I couldn't get hit from
arrows from the side. Right.

1310
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:55,130
There were like shielding themselves.
I mean if that was still going on,

1311
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,020
would you take narrating that job?

1312
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:03,340
That's my costume come up with. That'd
be pretty exciting stuff. It would.

1313
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:07,490
Right, right. It's a completely violation,
but the non aggression principle,

1314
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:08,970
sorry Theo.

1315
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,470
The beautiful thing about the UFC is
it's a mutually agreed upon competition.

1316
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,333
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1317
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,450
A character contest,

1318
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:19,900
a contest of will and planning and
discipline and to me it's, you know,

1319
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,600
the ultimate fighting championship
is to me literally the ultimate in

1320
01:09:24,601 --> 01:09:28,470
competition for a human being. As far as
like, I don't think it's for everybody,

1321
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,240
it's certainly not,

1322
01:09:30,241 --> 01:09:35,241
but I think as far as like the amount of
time and energy and focus and then the

1323
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,440
maintenance and the control of
your emotions during a contest,

1324
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:43,770
because you're literally putting your
health online and your consciousness,

1325
01:09:43,771 --> 01:09:45,750
you can get incredibly badly hurt.

1326
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:50,040
I think it's one of the reasons
why it's so incredibly exciting

1327
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,340
and the discipline you,
I can't remember the name of the final,

1328
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:54,650
but you're saying it's one guy who
keeps a list of everything he wants to

1329
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:57,920
accomplish by his bed and like [inaudible]
first thing that he gets up and I'm

1330
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:01,610
finding it just focuses on that stuff.
Favor doesn't, same thing. Yeah.

1331
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:05,240
They both hate each other.
Twin smelling. Let me,

1332
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,820
let me spin your theory
because we're talking about
the fighting stuff and I was,

1333
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,250
I was watching the show
last night and I was,

1334
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:13,040
I was thinking about like
why is this occurring?

1335
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,490
Like why people could be doing anything
with their time and money that come in

1336
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:18,830
here to see some really funny stuff.

1337
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,850
I was thinking about a
lot of the stuff that,

1338
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:26,180
that you and the other two comics
talked about is pretty visceral, right?

1339
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,400
I mean you, you've, you've got
this great phrase that you use. Um,

1340
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,490
the monkey energy,
you know,

1341
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:34,340
like you've got this crazy monkey energy
when you can't pay your mortgage and

1342
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:34,750
you know,

1343
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,090
you've got to go out and do something
physical because your body thinks there's

1344
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,850
like a tiger jumping at you and stuff
like that. And I was really struck by,

1345
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,640
you know, Dick fart jokes
and stuff like that. I mean,

1346
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,830
come jokes and stuff like that.
They're funny.

1347
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,160
But I think it's really interesting the
degree to which people respond to that

1348
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,870
because it's not polite conversation.
You know this,

1349
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,830
I've never seen a sign outside
the box office relative to yours.

1350
01:10:54,831 --> 01:10:59,420
It says the most extreme possible
language will be used. Like do not,

1351
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:02,660
if you, if you like Jane Austen,
your head is gonna explode in here.

1352
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:03,494
Like it's just not

1353
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:09,120
same sign since like the 1990s
actually that sign I put up,

1354
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:12,860
it's on my first CD, which is
called, I'm going to be dead Sunday,

1355
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,330
which released in 1999. And the, the,

1356
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:19,230
that sign was something that I started
putting up in comedy clubs because I got

1357
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,630
tired of people complaining
and I said it would contain,

1358
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:24,590
this show will contain the most
extreme content. Imagine that.

1359
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,220
Yeah. And it really did like I
have a pretty good imagination.

1360
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:33,110
They might have less did and
cam class. Well, no, that's
good. I mean that was good.

1361
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:36,080
That was good. So I was thinking, okay,
but why are people so drawn to this?

1362
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,780
Because it is a very common
component of comedy and all that.

1363
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:42,290
And let me give you a tiny theory and
then you can tell me that as an outside

1364
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:44,390
non comedian, I'm completely
bullish yet, which is fine, but,

1365
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:49,450
but I just sort of idea like we supposed
to be United in what to me is just a

1366
01:11:50,091 --> 01:11:54,500
lot of crap. You know, like
countries, patriotism, socialism,

1367
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:59,230
uh, our God, our saints are
whatever our client are like,

1368
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,740
it's all nonsense.

1369
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,520
And it doesn't actually connect people
because it's kind of fantastic. Right?

1370
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:07,790
I mean nobody, even countries,
they don't even really exist.

1371
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:10,220
They really colors on a map.
They call them tax farms,

1372
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:11,840
but they don't really
exist like a real thing.

1373
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:15,440
But where we can connect.

1374
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:19,910
And I think where this comedy show last
night really did help people connect was

1375
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:22,220
we are all mammals,
you know,

1376
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:26,180
and we have these bodily functions and
we have these impulses and these urges

1377
01:12:26,181 --> 01:12:28,950
and these fantasies. Like the first
guy talking about his fantasy of yeah,

1378
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,050
it'll Gadol Brian Cowen. Yeah.
Brilliant stuff. Brilliant stuff.

1379
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:34,610
And anything again.

1380
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:37,180
And I'm English enough to know that
anything that marks the French gets up

1381
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,690
anyway. But, um,

1382
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:42,860
so I think that there's this like monkey
meetup club that goes on in comedy

1383
01:12:42,861 --> 01:12:47,540
clubs where we do connect to that really
visceral level of, you know, of shitting,

1384
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:51,860
of fucking, of farting, of, of,
of sex drives of, of, you know,

1385
01:12:51,861 --> 01:12:53,150
the guy took it and got in the elevator,

1386
01:12:53,151 --> 01:12:55,910
was talking to said that one of the
funniest things to be that night with the

1387
01:12:55,911 --> 01:12:57,890
noise you made when he was done,

1388
01:12:57,891 --> 01:13:02,310
forgot to breathe when he's eating
so much that you'd be here. Right.

1389
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,200
But it's hilarious because we walk
in there like, this food is so good.

1390
01:13:06,201 --> 01:13:07,510
Why am I can't see out of my

1391
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:14,030
to do like that is that we want and
these are also really common experiences

1392
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:17,810
that we really can't talk about because
we live in these refined abstracts and

1393
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:20,660
countries and religions
and clubs and all that,

1394
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:22,370
but here at this level we really do,

1395
01:13:22,371 --> 01:13:25,640
I think connect in a very visceral way
and there was so much talked about it in

1396
01:13:25,641 --> 01:13:28,640
terms of connection and I
think the audience is laughing
because we never get to

1397
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:30,980
talk about how we connect
and an animal level.

1398
01:13:30,981 --> 01:13:32,690
Then I was thinking about the UFC as well,

1399
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,990
that a lot of your life I think is around
getting people to connect at a very

1400
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:38,750
visceral animal level and animal level.
Sounds bad.

1401
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:40,640
I don't mean it that way at all.
I think it's really,

1402
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:43,910
this is where we do connect at the
beginning. You know, we connect in sex,

1403
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:46,790
we connect and fighting,
we connect finally primally and there.

1404
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,180
I think a lot of your work has to do with
that and fear factor is also involved.

1405
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:53,630
That's really primal stuff. Primal
fears that people have confronted them,

1406
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:57,110
overcoming them. People watching that. I
think can really connect with that fear,

1407
01:13:57,111 --> 01:14:00,200
with that desire for the money and the
fear of the circumstances and all that.

1408
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,100
But the prime

1409
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:05,480
fear of competition itself, the, the,
the fear of failing, the fear of, uh,

1410
01:14:05,481 --> 01:14:08,840
overcoming adversity or not
being able to, that's, that's a,

1411
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:13,840
a real part of being person is
the challenges of life itself.

1412
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:17,690
And with fear factor is a stupid
show. You know, don't give me all,

1413
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:21,100
I don't have any grandiose ideas
of what taglines for that. Right.

1414
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:22,090
How was the factor?

1415
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:27,270
It's a stupid show really show it was
entertaining and I know people enjoyed it,

1416
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:30,640
but the, what is, what was
fascinating to me, it was,

1417
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,490
I have a background in martial arts and
in competition. More importantly, um, I,

1418
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:39,880
I thought most of my life
from age 15 to age 22,

1419
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:41,620
it's basically all I did with my time.

1420
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:46,750
And so I understand what it's like to
be confronted with a daunting task and

1421
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:49,630
understand what it's like to be standing
there when the referee looks at you and

1422
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:52,210
goes, are you ready? You know and
then looks at the other guy and goes,

1423
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:56,880
are you ready? Go. You know, in that
moment that like here it is, Whoa,

1424
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:00,430
like a cliff, right? I mean it's a very
strange thing for us to just say, ready,

1425
01:15:00,431 --> 01:15:03,490
go and then go do something.
It's, it's really hard to do,

1426
01:15:03,491 --> 01:15:06,940
to do it like to anticipate and also
as human beings we can counter and all

1427
01:15:06,941 --> 01:15:09,760
these different variables and one of
the things about being an intelligent

1428
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:12,010
person and facing a difficult competition,

1429
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:15,040
whether it's fighting or anything
incredibly hard, he's like,

1430
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,490
you were aware of the variables,
you're aware of the failure,

1431
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:19,810
the wear of the humiliation,

1432
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,770
your well where have the embarrassment
of failure you where we are.

1433
01:15:22,771 --> 01:15:25,930
If the personal dissatisfaction with
your own performance in depression that's

1434
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:30,931
going to come with that and all those
variables they can combine to create like

1435
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:36,150
a constriction effect where you
just almost can't perform you,

1436
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:36,681
you're,
you're,

1437
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:40,630
you're overwhelmed by the possibilities
and you would just freak the fuck out.

1438
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:45,310
It's called being dwarfed by the moment
the moment comes and it's one of the

1439
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:48,970
things that I was good at on fear factor
is to talk people through that and just

1440
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:51,220
to let them know like, look,
you can fucking do this.

1441
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,310
You just go out and you don't think
about anything else but doing it.

1442
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,160
All those other things are attract.
Those other things are demons.

1443
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,940
You got to keep those demons
at bay. Don't, don't entertain
them. Don't feed them.

1444
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:04,190
Don't give them water. Push them
away. They don't exist. Well,

1445
01:16:04,191 --> 01:16:06,730
you're going to concentrate
on as repeating the mantra
that you can do this and

1446
01:16:06,731 --> 01:16:09,070
this is how you're going to do it.
Be in the moment and go do this,

1447
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:13,720
and I helped a lot of people get through
that show because of that and that that

1448
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:15,170
has a primal thing that's up.

1449
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,630
That's the difference between someone
who survives an encounter with a Jaguar

1450
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,650
and someone who does it.

1451
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:24,640
You know that someone who packs and
freezes up and gets killed and someone who

1452
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:26,890
runs away,
someone figures out how to climb a tree.

1453
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,280
Somebody figures out how to pick a rock
and smash it into had the, the, the,

1454
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:34,900
the difference between
someone who encounters an
incredibly difficult situation

1455
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:39,820
and learns from it or dies because of it.
That's a primal thing,

1456
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:40,151
man.

1457
01:16:40,151 --> 01:16:44,590
I mean that is one of the reasons why
we're here is because people did confront

1458
01:16:44,591 --> 01:16:45,370
predators.

1459
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:49,450
And the reason why children are afraid
at night of monsters is because we have

1460
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:54,130
genetic, they're monsters,
jaguars and leopards eating us.

1461
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:54,980
I remember reading

1462
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,800
a story about a guy who got
bitten bike, right? Right.

1463
01:16:57,801 --> 01:17:01,220
Shot and not like it bitten went
off like it took his whole torso.

1464
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,430
It is math and it's math and it swam in
the water with him and he was so dazed.

1465
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,740
He said he remembered it all very vividly
and cause like he wasn't a head injury

1466
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:10,010
right here.

1467
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,170
You forget stuff then. Right. But he was,

1468
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:14,630
he was under the water and he was just
being basically pulled along into the

1469
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:15,530
deep water by the shark,

1470
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,460
which hadn't been this in his joints
and he was just dates and he was like,

1471
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,370
I'm fucked. You know? Okay, well,
what am I going to do here? Right.

1472
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:26,270
And then did the image of his kids
came up and his wife and he's like,

1473
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:29,540
no fucking way. And he just
reached up and he jammed his hand,

1474
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:34,040
the end of the eye of the sharp.
Wow. And it shook him free.

1475
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:37,580
They'd let go because you know, I
guess that hurts. I can imagine. Right.

1476
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:41,690
And he's slammed at the surface and
he lived and he made it back to shore

1477
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,660
because there's that moment where
you just go like, no fucking way.

1478
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:48,590
I'm not going out like this. And that I
think is that thing. That's the primal,

1479
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:50,600
visceral response.
Whereas before it was just like,

1480
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:54,500
I'm going to surrender to this God awful
thing. And then it's just like, no,

1481
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,540
no way. No Way. I'm fighting back this.

1482
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:57,960
Well, that's what's fascinating. Well,

1483
01:17:57,961 --> 01:18:01,670
martial arts competition is that
everyone has a sort of no way thing,

1484
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,780
but the reality of no way is if you're
in the octagon with John Jones and you

1485
01:18:06,781 --> 01:18:09,060
say, no way, it doesn't
matter what you think.

1486
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,620
He said,
no way he's going to kill you.

1487
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:15,460
I won't keep it that I'm like a fine red
mist of nothingness in about 10 seconds.

1488
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:16,820
Some has been,

1489
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:22,140
they've prepared their entire life for
this moment and it's not just the no way

1490
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,300
that you get when you're
getting bit by a shark,

1491
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:30,560
but it's also knowing that that no
way is coming every fucking day.

1492
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:34,040
Getting up at 5:00 AM when the alarm
clock goes off and eating healthy and

1493
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,500
running and making sure you have the
right amount of rest and take the right

1494
01:18:36,501 --> 01:18:39,590
amount of vitamins and all that.

1495
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:43,700
Knowing that you have that instinct
to say no way, but so does he,

1496
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,730
and that's not going to be good
enough. Right, right. You're going to,

1497
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:50,060
you're going to have to control your body,
control your mind,

1498
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:54,320
developed your skills and
have an intelligent approach
to this very difficult

1499
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:55,730
task in front of you

1500
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:57,280
and you you've talked about,

1501
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,730
but when you were a kid that
you saw violence in your home.

1502
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:04,150
Fortunately of course, incredibly sorry.
Is it true that for a lot of these guys,

1503
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:08,500
they come from rough backgrounds and
some aggressive or violent backgrounds?

1504
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:12,280
A lot of them, almost all of them. And
what do you think the connection is there?

1505
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:15,610
Because in some ways you sort of think,
well, if you saw that kind of stuff,

1506
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:20,470
wouldn't you want to get away from it?
Well you would,

1507
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:23,830
but sometimes you can't. And so you
want to learn to protect yourself.

1508
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,490
And that's what a lot of it is. And a
lot of it is, a lot of guys were bullied.

1509
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:32,140
I was bullied not too badly.
I'm a, nobody really hurt me,

1510
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,840
but I was intimidated by a lot of guys,
you know,

1511
01:19:34,841 --> 01:19:36,970
like scared and it gets in your head,
the bullying,

1512
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:40,960
it just circles around your house,
humiliating. It's humiliating it, it can,

1513
01:19:40,961 --> 01:19:44,110
you know, it causes people to jump off
buildings. You know, it's, it's, it's a,

1514
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,750
it's a huge,
huge problem with human beings,

1515
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:50,530
this natural inclination to pick
on the weak, to satisfy our own,

1516
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,270
our own insecurities, you know?
And um, uh, for me, I was,

1517
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,000
I was a small kid.
I wasn't big.

1518
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,930
And there was just too many moments
where I was scared and I was like, okay,

1519
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:05,320
this is not how I want to live my life.
So I started taking martial arts.

1520
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,890
I was like, I got to learn how to
fight cause this just too scary.

1521
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,550
You don't want,
environment doesn't get an end.

1522
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:13,290
You get exactly the fraternity like this
is going to be the rest of my life and

1523
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:15,630
the environment is not going to change
at the teachers aren't going to stop it.

1524
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:19,260
There's no way for my parents to stop it
like if I don't act this is going to be

1525
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:20,970
the same fucking day
for the rest of my life.

1526
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:21,980
It was clear to me,

1527
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,910
it was clear to me that no one was
going to help me and as a boy it was a,

1528
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:29,900
one of the core issues of being a boy
growing up was dealing with the other boys

1529
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:34,400
and this balance of power which
was so against me. I was like,

1530
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:35,700
this is one of the things,
a lot of the findings,

1531
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,310
you know that story of
the kids in the jungle,

1532
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:40,610
they think it's like some island
somewhere. When a plane goes down,

1533
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,330
I mean it's high school. I went to
boarding school. I mean it's, it's not,

1534
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,950
it's not some island out there.

1535
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:49,280
It's like walking into the end of the
school building. It's human nature,

1536
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:52,170
nature. And there's the dance,
like who's the Alpha? Like what's,

1537
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:53,100
what's going to go on here?

1538
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:55,410
Like who's going to be the one
that controls the situation?

1539
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:59,130
Who's going to get the first pick of the
girls? Who's going to get, you know, what,

1540
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:01,620
who, who gets to pick on
people and get away with it.

1541
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:04,530
And that is a part of
being a human beings.

1542
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:07,140
And it's also a part of being a
human being. The, as you said,

1543
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:11,130
is developing in a society where children
not being raised correctly. So you're,

1544
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:15,620
you're not, if a child grows
up with martial arts as a,

1545
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,530
as a young boy,

1546
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:21,300
you'd be incredibly embarrassed to be a
bullying because that is the worst thing

1547
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:22,740
you could ever be in a martial arts class.

1548
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:28,070
I am a black belt in Jujitsu and I roll
on a regular basis roaming spar with

1549
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:31,380
people who are complete novices
and I don't hurt them ever.

1550
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,950
I've never heard one and you know I just,
I and I coached them along the way.

1551
01:21:34,951 --> 01:21:36,380
I'm like you've got to,
you've got attorneys that right

1552
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,700
does it like they don't want to keep
hitting my daughter cause were play

1553
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:39,061
wrestling.

1554
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:43,170
It's like for what have I been doing that
for mean sometimes it's big strong men,

1555
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,070
they're on trend.
But

1556
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,370
the point is like if,

1557
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,660
if I like humiliated them or beat
them up or something like that,

1558
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,800
it would be a massive
embarrassment for my school.

1559
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:58,110
A massive verus would for
me as a martial artist,

1560
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,050
like everyone in class
would hate me because of it.

1561
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:05,970
There are people like that that do like
bully and tried to hurt like lesser

1562
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:10,960
ranks or or novices. Those people are
kicked out of class like they, they,

1563
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,020
there's no place for them.
In martial arts,

1564
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:18,260
it's about developing character and then
about representing that development and

1565
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:18,961
character,

1566
01:22:18,961 --> 01:22:23,940
like having honor and having respect
and if kids learn that at an early age

1567
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:26,790
there'd be no bullying in class,
there would be none of that.

1568
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,850
There's always going to be people picking
on people and people make making fun

1569
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:34,140
of people. But bullying is specific like
ganging up on people and taking them.

1570
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:34,960
That's that.

1571
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,900
That is one of the scariest aspects of
growing up and it motivates a lot of

1572
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:43,830
martial artists to to learn
and that's what motivated me.

1573
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,660
So ultimately it's like this terribly
negative force channels itself into an

1574
01:22:48,661 --> 01:22:52,800
incredibly positive thing that really
became a developing factor for every

1575
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,970
aspect of my life and it became a,
it became a real vehicle.

1576
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,960
One of the, I love music sprays a
vehicle for developing human potential,

1577
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,290
so there's no, no, go
ahead. When you find out,

1578
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,740
because it's so you find out what you can
do and then other things become easier.

1579
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:12,250
Yeah, I think the mastery of
anything that's really challenging.

1580
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,020
I think great things for self esteem.

1581
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,440
Now when you started taking the martial
lights, what happened with the bullying?

1582
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:17,741
I mean,

1583
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:20,530
did you end up beating people up or did
you end up having the confidence that

1584
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:21,970
they then found a week or prey?

1585
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:27,080
Very few physical altercations
outside of competitions?

1586
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,651
You know,

1587
01:23:27,651 --> 01:23:31,850
I have like one or two small ones in
high school that were really no big deal.

1588
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,430
Um,
the nothing like crazy,

1589
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:39,110
but the fights that I had in
tournament's were so extreme, you know,

1590
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:43,200
like so many knockouts and
just so, so much. Craig,

1591
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:48,170
the violence of physical competition is
so much more intense than anything you'd

1592
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:51,740
ever experience in, in, uh, your
average street fight. You know,

1593
01:23:51,741 --> 01:23:55,040
like you're dealing with trained killers
like you and another train killer dude.

1594
01:23:55,080 --> 01:24:00,020
So like there was no motivation for me
to prove to anybody that I knew how to

1595
01:24:00,021 --> 01:24:04,310
fight. And then somewhere along
the line other kids do like, oh,

1596
01:24:04,311 --> 01:24:07,970
that's a, he's a black belt, he's this,
he's that. And they just left me alone.

1597
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,280
So it became just become scary enough.

1598
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:13,190
They leave you alone and then you
don't, you know, you avoid the fight.

1599
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,740
Even voice is always better than cure.
Right.

1600
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,590
And you have very little aggression
because you're always training.

1601
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,560
So like when you train all the time,
you're always tired.

1602
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:25,630
Like you know you have no, yeah.
People Think, oh my God, he's so fit.

1603
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:27,620
I think of all the energy you'd
have. It's like, oh my God,

1604
01:24:27,621 --> 01:24:30,230
I just got to get from the Futon, but the
cash, somebody give me a wheel better.

1605
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,190
It was a famous,
yeah.

1606
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:34,970
Karate master who once said
that the, the, the Tara Tika is,

1607
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:37,200
or not a nicer,
yeah,

1608
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:38,270
just tired from training.

1609
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:44,350
They avoid these things because they just,
it's too hard to just get up for it.

1610
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:48,700
Right, right. But I think that human
beings have a massive amount of,

1611
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:53,110
you know what I, I called Chimp Dna,
that th the, the monkey instincts,

1612
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:58,030
there's a massive amount of those that
are not being represented by the way we

1613
01:24:58,031 --> 01:24:59,500
live our lives,
the,

1614
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:04,070
the bodies that we have are essentially
the same bodies is the humility,

1615
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,740
is that live to a hundred thousand
years ago or 50,000 years ago?

1616
01:25:06,741 --> 01:25:09,830
It was very little
variation. Yeah. And the the,

1617
01:25:09,831 --> 01:25:14,831
the need for physical movement and the
need for just the activity and all these

1618
01:25:15,941 --> 01:25:16,570
different,

1619
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:20,500
these different hormones and chemicals
that your body just naturally produces.

1620
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,680
They have to be satisfied. They have
to be, they have to be moved around.

1621
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:28,600
And I think it's a huge part of
balancing your perspective in life,

1622
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,670
balancing your view of the world.

1623
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:34,900
It just to exercise these things out
of your system and for boys especially.

1624
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,420
Huge,
huge part of being sane.

1625
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:41,430
Yeah. Certainly learning how to
manage aggression is really important.

1626
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:42,840
I think one of the,
yeah,

1627
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:46,740
I'm in a strong atheist and I think one
of the things that was really harmful

1628
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:49,680
about religion was this
idea that we are antibody,

1629
01:25:49,681 --> 01:25:52,800
that we are souls trapped in this
prison of the flesh and we're,

1630
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,580
you know him to be these rockets that
rise up to meet the glory above and

1631
01:25:56,581 --> 01:26:00,330
someone, because I think that gave us
this feeling that the body is somehow,

1632
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:04,040
and it's very explicit in some forms of
Christianity and other too that the body

1633
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,550
is Satan's device to draw you away from
God the lasts and then all that other

1634
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,550
stuff that the comedians
make fun of it and celebrate.

1635
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,990
I think it's very probiotic,
right?

1636
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:14,210
Cause it's funny and it's
an enjoyable place to be.

1637
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:17,030
And I think that this hostility towards,
it's called in philosophy,

1638
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:19,010
the mind body dichotomy
that we have this glorious,

1639
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:23,210
my attracted this horrible fleshly chorus
kind of thing. I think it's really,

1640
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:26,540
really unhealthy. And I didn't really
get that when I was young. Like when,

1641
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,080
when I was 20 I went to the
national theater school,

1642
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,360
I was going to be an actor
and a playwright. And then
some of that for a bit.

1643
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:35,540
But what they did there,
which I thought was amazing,

1644
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:40,670
was real bodywork, which I'd never been
exposed to before and grew up in England,

1645
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:43,700
you know, evens relationship to the
body is, you know, and it's crazy,

1646
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:44,900
right when you can clean their teeth.

1647
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:51,110
I love the taste of ginger fighters in the
morning and I was like, empire. But, um,

1648
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:55,220
when I did this body work, which was like
a, I don't feel the Alexandra technique,

1649
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:58,550
which is a binary repositioning
technique that we did gymnastics,

1650
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:00,230
we did a sword fighting,

1651
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:02,510
we did play yellow stage fighting
and all that kind of stuff,

1652
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:06,560
which is like in some ways more
challenging. And uh, we did, um,

1653
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,830
the stretching and,
and I got into yoga and stuff like that.

1654
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,670
And I always encouraging this in my
shell because an idea with a pretty hyper

1655
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:15,860
intellectual audience, and I keep
trying to remind people, you know,

1656
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:17,420
drive your brain back into the body,

1657
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:20,510
drive your brain back into the idea that
as a seed of everything that you are,

1658
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,190
and you know,
if that doesn't do well,

1659
01:27:22,191 --> 01:27:24,920
you're not going to do well in the long
run and don't split yourself off from

1660
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:25,310
the body.

1661
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:29,240
But there's this weird thing in society
where we are somehow not our bodies and

1662
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:30,530
it has to do with the sole idea.

1663
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:33,830
We can continue afterwards and I don't
think I'm going to have any more reality

1664
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:36,950
after I'm death. And I did before I
was born, which is to say not at all.

1665
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,840
And this is,
this is where we are.

1666
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,140
And I really try to encourage people to
really root themselves in that. You know,

1667
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:43,790
we have a second brain called the gap,

1668
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,700
which is almost as complex as the one
we've got up here. And people say,

1669
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:49,700
I've got to get instinct. That's, that's
real. That's not an imaginary thing.

1670
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:52,490
There's this great book by
Malcolm Gladwell called Blink.

1671
01:27:52,491 --> 01:27:55,550
You should pick it up if you haven't read
or have. Yeah. Okay, so when he says,

1672
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:55,731
you know,

1673
01:27:55,731 --> 01:28:00,731
people get stuff like so incredibly
quickly and that's not a intellectual

1674
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:04,490
process. That is a full body
process and I think the people,

1675
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,800
you know in terms of you say,
well how do we heal the world?

1676
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,880
I think our bodies detect in morality
a lot quicker than our brains do.

1677
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,120
Like you don't have those people.
They'd come around, you're like, man,

1678
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:15,710
there's something not
right about this guy.

1679
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:18,310
I don't know if body language they
look perfectly normal or whatever.

1680
01:28:18,311 --> 01:28:21,410
If it's a slight vacancies in the eyes
or something like that or was overly

1681
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:25,880
stiff body posture or something like that.
I think that if we could see,

1682
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,830
you call them, I think exquisite noose
bags they you're talking about now,

1683
01:28:29,831 --> 01:28:32,000
but it takes down hopes
the party in the desert.

1684
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,390
Then he could have these parties but
there'd be a thousand cool guys and then

1685
01:28:35,391 --> 01:28:38,030
one unbelievable Douche bag who
would just ruin it for everyone.

1686
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,530
I think we can see those people,

1687
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:42,080
but I think we can mostly see them
with the body and heart with the brain

1688
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:44,030
because the brain,
we can talk herself in and out of stuff.

1689
01:28:44,031 --> 01:28:47,780
But the Bonnie I think really connects
at a very visceral level with the people

1690
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:50,750
that were around us. And I think if we
could train people to be more in the body,

1691
01:28:50,751 --> 01:28:53,690
I think they'd be better at detecting
bullshit and better at detecting bad

1692
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:54,650
people and shunning them.

1693
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:58,370
And then we kind of isolate them in
quarantine them not breed with them that

1694
01:28:58,371 --> 01:28:59,930
having motor fucking upper kids.

1695
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:03,810
And I think then we'd be able to pass
that gene out of the pool so to speak.

1696
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:05,010
Sorry,
there's a hell of a lot rent.

1697
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:06,890
No,
absolutely on.

1698
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:10,830
And I think that the idea that the
body is separate from the mind,

1699
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,410
it's really kind of silly.
It's they, they, they, they,

1700
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:18,470
they work together and if the mind is
working overtime and the body is falling

1701
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:21,460
apart though the mind's
not to be at its optimum.

1702
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:26,480
Even if you have an incredibly advanced
mine and beautiful knowledge and

1703
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:29,550
information, it would be better
if your body isn't shaped.

1704
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,620
It'd be better if you were limber.

1705
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:34,170
It'd be better if you
were weren't stressed out.

1706
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:38,550
Like we experience a physical
stress of the deteriorating bodies.

1707
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:43,150
It's legitimate. It's 100%
real. It's not just a um, uh,

1708
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:47,220
a vain thing. Do you want to keep your
body in shape to look good? You know,

1709
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:49,920
it's an ego thing. It's
not, it's, it's, you're,

1710
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:53,120
you are some weird symbiotic thing,
you know,

1711
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,850
it's the mind and the body and
then also the intestinal flora.

1712
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:59,820
It gets really freaky when
you start realizing that
you're actually an ecosystem.

1713
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:02,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was one thing.

1714
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:05,940
And the ecosystem is even within the mind
as this great therapy called internal

1715
01:30:05,941 --> 01:30:08,310
family systems therapy,
which basically says that we are,

1716
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:13,110
we don't have like a single south, like
we are competing ecosystem of, you know,

1717
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:16,120
our parents and those who want
stuff from us in our, you know,

1718
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,960
some of our own needs, which is also
to please those who wants that from us.

1719
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:22,230
And it's all it competing. And if you
think that you've gotten like one ego,

1720
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:26,160
you end up being a kind of tyrant because
all these other voices in your head

1721
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,230
telling you to do stuff or
encouraged me to do stuff,

1722
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,500
kind of kept him down cause we need unity.

1723
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,520
But I think the idea that we are always
in a state of negotiation with ourselves,

1724
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:37,460
uh, is really positive. And you know,

1725
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:40,350
I spent years in therapy and I think
it's just fantastic to work for that kind

1726
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:44,790
of approach that we have. I call it the
Mikko system like me as an ecosystem. Uh,

1727
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:45,151
and,

1728
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:49,560
and it really is a lot of give and take
and a lot of negotiation with yourself.

1729
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,390
And of course,
if you can negotiate with yourself,

1730
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:54,210
I think you'll end up with a society
where people negotiate with each other.

1731
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:57,670
I think that the people who are tyrannical
with their own identity and that

1732
01:30:57,671 --> 01:31:00,990
being tyrannical, but with others, I
think that the way the world is out there,

1733
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:03,300
it's very much a mirror of
the way we live internally.

1734
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,810
And if we can be more at
peace and negotiating with
ourselves and recognize that

1735
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:09,750
we should not have a single
dominant authority within ourselves,

1736
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:11,670
but everything is a negotiation,
you know,

1737
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:13,290
do I want to work out or I
don't want to have an APP.

1738
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,800
I mean I have those negotiations with
myself all the time and that way I can

1739
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:18,740
negotiate with my wife and
my daughter and my she,

1740
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,110
my listeners and all that and I don't have
a tyrannical part of myself that says,

1741
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:24,180
well you just got to do this.
God Damn it no matter what.

1742
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:27,870
Because I'm always afraid that if that's
the way it is for me in there, in here,

1743
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,690
that's how it's going to
translate to the world out there.

1744
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:32,760
I always feel that the, the, the,

1745
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:36,060
the most massive structures in the
world and the government states,

1746
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:39,750
armies and all that, just a reflection
of how we deal with ourselves internally.

1747
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:43,230
And I think try and get people to relax
about how they deal with themselves

1748
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:46,020
internally and negotiating more than
dictate. I think it's really important.

1749
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,780
I'm completely rambling,
but I hope that makes some makes sense.

1750
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,810
And the,
the rigidity,

1751
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:54,350
being rigid and not being able
to be flexible about things.

1752
01:31:54,351 --> 01:31:58,310
There's also you just shoo the ability
to alter your ideas about things and not

1753
01:31:58,311 --> 01:31:59,980
feel like you're loser because you

1754
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,660
changed your mind.
You know,

1755
01:32:01,661 --> 01:32:06,661
like the ability to admit mistakes and
to be able to express where the mistake

1756
01:32:08,501 --> 01:32:12,670
went wrong and what, what he believed.
Now. I think that that's very important.

1757
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:13,710
I think one of the,

1758
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:18,550
the things that I see in people that I
admire is one of the things I admire most

1759
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,670
is the ability to make, make wrong,
the ability to make mistakes,

1760
01:32:21,671 --> 01:32:23,830
the ability to admit,
admit personal failures,

1761
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:27,100
and then the ability to grow
from learning about that mistake.

1762
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:31,720
And one of the things that I find to be
one of the most incredibly weak and I

1763
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:34,600
intolerable things is someone
who cannot admit they're wrong.

1764
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:38,270
I can't communicate with people like
that. I can't, I can't. Yeah, I've,

1765
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,900
I make mistakes all the
time. If you don't, you know,

1766
01:32:40,901 --> 01:32:44,020
maybe you're the perfect person,
but if you do and you don't admit it,

1767
01:32:44,021 --> 01:32:44,750
we can't talk.

1768
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:48,080
Okay. We can't, well, isn't
most of life not working out?

1769
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,120
I mean this is most of the
most of life failure. I mean,

1770
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:54,560
that's one of my favorite writers is
Charles Dickens or you take Shakespeare.

1771
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:59,720
Charles Dickens wrote like 35 novels
of which like four or five or famous.

1772
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:00,160
So He's,
well,

1773
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:04,130
he's the best novelist that we've ever
produced as a species and he's got a

1774
01:33:04,131 --> 01:33:08,270
success rate of 20% if it shakes me,
we're one of 54 plays,

1775
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,550
hundreds of sonnets and of his plays,

1776
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:14,930
maybe 10 are regularly produce.
No, the hamlets off dollars,

1777
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:15,890
motion events and all that.

1778
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:20,030
So he had a success rate of about 20 so
the greatest conceivable genius is in

1779
01:33:20,031 --> 01:33:22,370
human history,
you have a success rate of about 20%

1780
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:25,810
I've had some of my biggest
breakthroughs from failures,

1781
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:30,990
from my disgust in the
failure or my discontent and
my recognizing where it went

1782
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:37,171
wrong and then my reenergizing and
refocusing my standup comedy failures.

1783
01:33:37,931 --> 01:33:41,440
I can literally point
to the moments on stage,

1784
01:33:41,441 --> 01:33:43,990
like the worst bombings and
the history of my career,

1785
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:47,320
and then the giant leaps that
I made and progress after that.

1786
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:50,770
It's always been the case.
And I now to this day,

1787
01:33:50,771 --> 01:33:54,640
if I have a set that's not so good,
I recognize that I hate that.

1788
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:58,870
So I will now refocus and then this is a
good thing because it's taught me well,

1789
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:02,860
you got a little sloppy there or you got
overwhelmed by responsibilities or what,

1790
01:34:02,861 --> 01:34:04,630
you didn't put enough focus in it,
whatever it was.

1791
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:09,700
Now is the time to recognize that just
like every other time in the past,

1792
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:12,880
you are now going to grow and you'll
be better than you ever were before.

1793
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:15,870
Yeah, I did. I didn't want to show and
I thought I did the right research,

1794
01:34:15,871 --> 01:34:17,310
but I didn't at all.

1795
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,010
I did a show on healthcare and then
this woman who was a doctor, uh,

1796
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,710
who was pretty high up in the profession,

1797
01:34:22,711 --> 01:34:26,470
she wrote me this long email
detailing every single thing.

1798
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,010
But I kept running in my shell. And so
what I did was I, you know, I am like,

1799
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,760
I just read this whole email
believe sorry. I just, you know,

1800
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:35,550
I thought I knew what I was talking about.

1801
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:38,640
It turns out I had to had come so far
in my ass and we see him back out of my

1802
01:34:38,641 --> 01:34:40,090
own eyeballs. Good on you. Yeah.

1803
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,870
And it's a read the whole thing because
if you're not correcting yourself,

1804
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,510
how you're going to have any credibility
because nobody believes that your ride

1805
01:34:45,511 --> 01:34:46,840
all the time.
That's just impossible.

1806
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:51,410
I correct myself all the time on the
podcast because a lot of times during the

1807
01:34:51,411 --> 01:34:53,660
podcast we're completely
talking out of her ass.

1808
01:34:53,661 --> 01:34:56,570
I remember something and then I'll
be like, fuck. And now I go, hold on,

1809
01:34:56,571 --> 01:35:00,560
let me Google. Like I'll, I'll constantly
Google things when the middle I go, okay,

1810
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:05,030
I'm full of Shit because actually they
proved it in 1972 that this is, you know,

1811
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:07,400
and I think that's really,
really, really important,

1812
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:12,410
especially when you have
this weird responsibility.
Like as I know that you do,

1813
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,460
you have a massive following online and
a lot of people very much respect your

1814
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:20,030
opinions, your thoughts on things
and consider them very highly.

1815
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,180
So when you know,
you,

1816
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:26,060
you say something or you go over something
and then it turns out that it was

1817
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:28,190
incorrect or it was you,

1818
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:30,920
your original assumption was
based on some bad information.

1819
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:34,100
It's so important to
be flexible like that.

1820
01:35:34,101 --> 01:35:38,540
So important to be honest like that and
so that people recognize like you're a

1821
01:35:38,541 --> 01:35:42,350
human being and everyone is listening as
a human being and we're all essentially

1822
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:43,460
in the same boat together.

1823
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:47,000
One of us may have focused more on a
particular topic or one of us may have had

1824
01:35:47,001 --> 01:35:50,150
more talent in a particular area,
but we're the same goddamn thing.

1825
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:54,090
No, I think, I think it is
important. And uh, yeah,

1826
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,110
especially when you put out a lot of
chefs you can just going against that.

1827
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:58,830
You can't be an expert in everything.

1828
01:35:58,831 --> 01:36:01,230
And that's the question
that you have to read.

1829
01:36:01,231 --> 01:36:03,930
And you also might want to model that
behavior for people, right? I mean,

1830
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:06,330
because if you're the defensive guy
who can't admit that he's wrong,

1831
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,640
I mean the kind of people who are going
to end up being comfortable with you are

1832
01:36:09,641 --> 01:36:11,730
not the kind of people you
want to have around. Oh,

1833
01:36:11,731 --> 01:36:14,100
this guy never admits he's wrong.
He's an okay guy for me.

1834
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:17,410
Like you want to have that forcefield
that repels the people who,

1835
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:19,070
who want that because
that's not a good place.

1836
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,250
I have a very critical forum and
sometimes critical in a bad way.

1837
01:36:23,251 --> 01:36:26,190
Like there's a lot of congee behavior
and a lot of people just are really just

1838
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:27,840
negative people.
Uh,

1839
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:30,790
but a lot of really intelligent
people too that are really rely on it.

1840
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:34,290
And sometimes if I have a show that
doesn't go well or if something happens or

1841
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:37,050
there's a dispute about
something, Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

1842
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:39,530
The criticism I think is hugely important,

1843
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:43,470
especially if it's honest and it's
intelligent because that wasn't available

1844
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:43,951
before.

1845
01:36:43,951 --> 01:36:48,600
And one of the resources of the internet
that's so fantastic to me is that you

1846
01:36:48,601 --> 01:36:51,840
can get opinions and you
can get intelligent ideas
from people that you would

1847
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:56,220
never be able to contact with a 10 2030
years ago. You just wouldn't be able to,

1848
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:59,190
and now you get them and you can
interact with them in real time.

1849
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:03,090
And it's a beautiful thing and it's so
enriching and it's so important for your

1850
01:37:03,091 --> 01:37:06,270
personal growth and for the growth of
anything you're trying to do to have these

1851
01:37:06,271 --> 01:37:10,170
intelligent people giving their point
of view. You may or may not agree.

1852
01:37:10,171 --> 01:37:11,670
And that's one of the
things I find along the way.

1853
01:37:11,671 --> 01:37:15,900
Like I'll have a read it and really
intelligent review of why something that I

1854
01:37:15,901 --> 01:37:19,200
did was not right. And I'm like,
I see where you're coming from,

1855
01:37:19,201 --> 01:37:23,700
but I disagree entirely. I can
respect that, but I don't like that.

1856
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,130
I don't like this that you're
saying is good. I don't like,

1857
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,980
I don't like smashing pumpkins.
I don't like grateful dead.

1858
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,410
There's a lot of things,
a lot of people like that I don't like.

1859
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,720
Actually I do like smashing pumpkins.

1860
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:37,840
Shouldn't say that both blue
skies of the songs, it was due to,

1861
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,510
what does that one song?

1862
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:42,120
I know the 79 I think.
Is there any song that I know

1863
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:44,730
was that world is a vampire.
Do you know that one?

1864
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:48,260
You are the person who is more of that
kind of music, I think, than I am.

1865
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,030
I love that song.
So I shouldn't say

1866
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:56,340
my temptation though. I gotta
tell you my, my weakness is a Joe.

1867
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,580
You gotta stop me if I do this, I
want to nit pick back, nit pick back.

1868
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,480
So I talked to a lot of libertarians
and libertarians, God loved them.

1869
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,660
Greatest people in the world.
But if you make one factual slip,

1870
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:09,990
like 6 million guys are going to come
down with you and Ricky reed references

1871
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:13,020
coming down eyeballs. So at
the end of the day, I was like,

1872
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:16,320
I said something about tigers
in Africa, right? You know,

1873
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:18,660
and like 6 million people email me.
Do you know God?

1874
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:21,210
How can you believe that there is high
cause an affricate tigers are native to

1875
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:25,570
India. There's no tigers in Africa and
Africa. Completely true except goal.

1876
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:30,470
No, no. Yeah. As soon as I'm like, I
bet you there's one taiga in Africa, so,

1877
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:35,000
oh no, no, don't do that. When you're
rolling the wrong, I guess in Africa,

1878
01:38:35,001 --> 01:38:35,630
I'm with that.

1879
01:38:35,630 --> 01:38:37,250
Yeah. Well, you know,

1880
01:38:37,251 --> 01:38:41,330
people love that sport of
calling people out on the stakes.

1881
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:46,110
There's a certain like scorecard that you
keep, you know, we can bust someone out.

1882
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:50,780
A why or by someone on
a misquote or a mistake.

1883
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:55,220
It's a, that's a big part of the deep
bumping movement. I had a guy on recently,

1884
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,290
a guy named Mick West, uh, who's, uh,

1885
01:38:57,470 --> 01:39:01,820
who runs contrail science.org.
Oh, the contrail snap. Yeah.

1886
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,380
And it's all about in his,

1887
01:39:04,381 --> 01:39:08,480
his website is he runs metal bunk
dot award, which is a message board.

1888
01:39:08,481 --> 01:39:13,070
It's all about deep bunking conspiracies
and ideas and incorrect. Awesome.

1889
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:17,510
One of the things that these guys love
doing is debunking things for like a

1890
01:39:17,511 --> 01:39:21,050
score they like for them it's
like, you know, incorrect,

1891
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:25,200
this is what's right and this is,
and they like calling people out on state,

1892
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:29,930
right. It, it gives them with, oh my God,

1893
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:33,390
I'm sorry. That's the wrong number
of grains of coffee for my coffee.

1894
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,240
I've explicitly tells you the right
number. That's just off by three.

1895
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,310
So they're right with the right,
you know,

1896
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:41,630
I don't think I should be happy,
you know,

1897
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:44,670
and also the level of importance of stuff.
See like I've had,

1898
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:48,390
I've done write speeches about really
important stuff and make one little error

1899
01:39:48,391 --> 01:39:51,030
and people are like, ah. It's like you
have a big picture of people, you know,

1900
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,540
the sun has spots. It doesn't
mean it's not like they're
right. Right, right, right.

1901
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:58,460
Yeah. Oh, I just wanted to ask
you a penis knowledge. Absolutely.

1902
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:00,630
And everybody felt that this
was essential, uh, to add you,

1903
01:40:00,631 --> 01:40:01,860
and I don't know if you
ever figured this one out,

1904
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:05,200
but I watched the stuff you did.
UNCIRCUMCISION [inaudible] cause we did a,

1905
01:40:05,201 --> 01:40:08,430
it was Mike's idea actually. Yeah. We
did a video on, on circumcision as well,

1906
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:11,700
which started off with a video of
someone getting circumcise the baby.

1907
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:14,190
And it's like, if you can watch
that and still go ahead with it.

1908
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:17,110
I mean already checked yourself
in against the meds, right? Yeah.

1909
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,230
You had a question about,

1910
01:40:19,231 --> 01:40:23,730
because I think that the show got the
opinion that women said that the sex was

1911
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,690
uncircumcised penis was
better. And I think you were
looking that up in the show.

1912
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:30,180
And I don't know if you ever
got the answer, but we found,

1913
01:40:30,181 --> 01:40:33,300
I think we've found the answer, uh,
through various experimentation with it,

1914
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:37,860
with fruits and veggies. I'm kidding. Um,
but what, what it is is because the, the,

1915
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:40,560
the four skin, uh, has, um, it,

1916
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:43,400
it makes less friction for the woman,
right?

1917
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:46,380
Cause when you thrust the foreskin
has some gift, right? Right. So it's,

1918
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,910
it's less friction for the woman. Uh,
and because it's less friction is more,

1919
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:52,770
more comfortable because, you know, it's
just kind of rubbing, rubbing, rubbing.

1920
01:40:52,771 --> 01:40:53,640
Right. So, right.

1921
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,100
So you trust and the four skin
has a give back and forth.

1922
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:01,180
And so it doesn't stress the woman's
vagina as much through that friction.

1923
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,170
That's apparently,

1924
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,080
which is why I think guys who was second
inside and you need more lubricants and

1925
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:07,540
stuff like that. Uh, you
know, like a good spray,

1926
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:11,020
probably be 40 before you go in
or whatever. But I'm no expert.

1927
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:14,710
I just want to do, as I mentioned
that and this, this, this,

1928
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:18,190
it prevents aids kind of stuff. What
the fuck is that about? Yeah, I mean,

1929
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,500
well first of all,
those studies are heavily suspect,

1930
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:24,190
then rely on self reporting and stuff
like that. And secondly, it actually,

1931
01:41:24,191 --> 01:41:26,380
let's say it does reduce,
ate a certain amount,

1932
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,630
which has not actually been proven to do.

1933
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,820
It's actually kind of dangerous
because then the guys think,

1934
01:41:30,821 --> 01:41:32,860
well I have seven size,
I don't need a condom.

1935
01:41:33,110 --> 01:41:36,220
But that even if you're circumcised,
they still say, well for God's sake,

1936
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:37,740
wear a condom if you want to,
if still.

1937
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:40,270
So it can actually be kind of dangerous
and increase the spread of AIDS if

1938
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:45,030
people believe that study. So,
so the 60% decrease in eating,

1939
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,800
fracturing people sort of sense like,
well okay document.

1940
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:50,170
So 60% are you still gonna
roll those dice? You know,

1941
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:55,120
I don't need a condom because you know,
how do you,

1942
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:56,980
how do you justify those numbers are,

1943
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:58,810
I wouldn't love to see
how they figured that out.

1944
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:02,580
It's that guy and you have a lot of
sex with a guy with aids, you know,

1945
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:08,310
and then you know you circumcise him and
a well now he's even less 80 like you.

1946
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,550
How are you doing it? Not known
for an excess of soap, right?

1947
01:42:12,551 --> 01:42:15,460
I mean this is really rough down
there. Right? So there's that problem.

1948
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:16,840
The penile cancer thing,

1949
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:20,630
I mean even the American Society of
Pediatrics because they say, you know,

1950
01:42:20,631 --> 01:42:23,770
you put P and l and cancer together,
you usually we'll get a man's attention.

1951
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:28,690
As you know, these were like,
Hey, I wasn't listening before.

1952
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:33,130
I pricked up my ears a penile. When
you added cancer to it, I really,

1953
01:42:33,131 --> 01:42:34,580
really began to listen. But the, the,

1954
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:37,990
the numbers that go down
are so infinitesimally small
and the chances of getting

1955
01:42:37,991 --> 01:42:39,250
in are so teeny tiny.

1956
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:42,280
I mean it's like saying well but remove
the baby's breasts because she might get

1957
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:46,000
breast cancer. Like this support is
about then the support for circumcision,

1958
01:42:46,001 --> 01:42:50,830
the unit, almost universal support
though we find it's in America or Europe,

1959
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:53,350
it's hard to find any non
Muslim kids who are circumcised.

1960
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,430
What does it in America,

1961
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:58,270
I mean it's a barbaric mutilation of a
baby's genitals as far as I'm concerned.

1962
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:03,040
Yeah. I think it's some
ancient Paul Scheer removing
half the skin of the penis.

1963
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:06,910
I mean it's not just the tip. I mean,
sorry, let's put it that bluntly.

1964
01:43:06,911 --> 01:43:10,410
And you have to put put shit
into wedge it because the, the,

1965
01:43:10,411 --> 01:43:14,170
the baby's born with the forced again in
here, physically adhere it to the penis.

1966
01:43:14,171 --> 01:43:15,310
You got to go and anyway,

1967
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:19,570
we don't have to handle everything on
page details of deaths or mutilations,

1968
01:43:19,571 --> 01:43:23,890
which are numerous. But the idea that
it's still exists is troubling to me.

1969
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:28,870
I don't, it doesn't, there's no rational,
it's not rational sense to it. There's,

1970
01:43:28,871 --> 01:43:32,080
there's things that I get,
I see if cause and effect and I see,

1971
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,840
I see why people do it. I don't see
that one. I don't understand it.

1972
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:38,950
The only thing that I see is perhaps a
justification of the old ways and the

1973
01:43:38,951 --> 01:43:42,070
fact that it's been done for so long.
It's been a style. And people say,

1974
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:44,650
I want the sun to look like the dad.
And I mean,

1975
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:47,620
how often a your son and your
husband comparing penises,

1976
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:51,230
is that a big family hobby? I mean, we've
been at our dinner saying, well you know,

1977
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,190
as longer and bigger. So I think, I think
a lot of it has to do with, you know,

1978
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:57,770
why does trauma repeat, why does
trauma, it's a big question.

1979
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:59,000
Why does trauma repeat?

1980
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:03,890
And I think Ponti white trauma repeats
as it gets normalized, right? I mean,

1981
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:06,290
so you obviously made the
great decision after seeing,

1982
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:09,130
you already had to do normalize what
your dad did cause it hitting your mom.

1983
01:44:09,131 --> 01:44:11,710
I mean you,
you said like this is not how men are,

1984
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:15,110
this is not how I'm going to be.
Right. So you, you normalize it.

1985
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,020
But if you totally worshiped him and he
thought he was the best kind of ever,

1986
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:21,570
and this is what men do, you would be
most likely to be enacted. Well, actually,

1987
01:44:21,571 --> 01:44:21,790
yeah.

1988
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:26,790
Did until I saw that it was one of the
most did when I saw my dad hit my mom

1989
01:44:27,341 --> 01:44:30,790
when I was about five. It was the
first time I'd ever seen him striker.

1990
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:33,100
And I never forgot the fee.

1991
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:37,150
I mean it's really difficult to
remember exactly what I remember,

1992
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:41,630
but I do remember very,
very clear feeling now.

1993
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:46,180
Very feel clear feeling was,
oh he's fucked up too.

1994
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:49,210
Like oh I thought that my dad was my hero.

1995
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:52,180
And I remember being
massively disappointed.

1996
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:55,030
I'll never forget that
feeling of disappointment.

1997
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:59,650
Like this is not what I thought. I
thought my dad was awesome. Perfect guy.

1998
01:44:59,651 --> 01:45:04,420
And he's not at all, you know, he's a bad
person. Right. And this is a bad scene.

1999
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:08,010
No mine. But why do you think you had
that response? Because some kids wouldn't,

2000
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,750
some kids would be like, oh I can't wait
to grow up and hit my own woman. Right.

2001
01:45:10,751 --> 01:45:12,880
I mean why do you think
you had that response?

2002
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,590
Cause I, cause I love my mom. You
know, my mom was not a bad person.

2003
01:45:16,591 --> 01:45:21,200
She was not an angry person. And when
she got all that cause it, she was,

2004
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,240
she was a strong woman.
She is still at,

2005
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,780
but she realized at that moment
like this is not happening.

2006
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:29,640
And she packed up our
stuff and we were gone.

2007
01:45:29,641 --> 01:45:34,050
But I'll never forget the
feeling of disappointment.
They're like, oh, you know,

2008
01:45:34,051 --> 01:45:36,870
like when you're a child,
you hope that your father is a hero.

2009
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:41,710
And to know that he's not.
So I think for me it was this,

2010
01:45:41,711 --> 01:45:46,380
this very young introduction
to close violence,

2011
01:45:46,381 --> 01:45:50,040
violence within the household was, um, uh,

2012
01:45:50,130 --> 01:45:54,000
sort of a defining factor why
I was terrified of violence,

2013
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,970
why I wanted to learn to defend myself,
like really early on.

2014
01:45:56,971 --> 01:45:59,850
Like the idea that someone could just
do that to you or that someone could do

2015
01:45:59,851 --> 01:46:03,260
that to my wife or someone can
do that to my mother. Right?

2016
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:07,670
Yeah, it is. Um, I think that kind of
recoiling from it. So you do normalize it.

2017
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:11,360
It was a bad thing. I do. Do you as a
dad? I mean, I know me as a dad, I mean,

2018
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:15,420
I'm the idea that I would ever see that
and look at my daughter's face or the

2019
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,310
fall from grace. Doesn't that terrify
you? Terrifies me. I mean, I'm not like,

2020
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,030
you know,

2021
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:23,390
constantly trying to be like some statute
of perfect fatherhood or whatever,

2022
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:27,320
but the idea that I would
disappoint my daughter, uh,

2023
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:31,460
in that fundamental way where she have
that crossroads with me and no longer

2024
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:34,550
look at me in that same, you
know, look up to kind of way.

2025
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:38,270
I really think about that like every day.
I would never want to see that. I think

2026
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:41,300
the love that people have for their
children often motivates them to be better

2027
01:46:41,301 --> 01:46:45,890
person, be a better person. I know it does
for me, you know, I, I couldn't imagine,

2028
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:50,070
you know, I mean, if I even raise
my voice to my daughter, it's like,

2029
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,360
come on, seriously, you can't do
that. We can't hit each other camp.

2030
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:56,580
Throw things through a
window. You can't, you know,

2031
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:01,830
the idea of hitting my daughter is insane.
It's alien.

2032
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:02,790
It's impossible.

2033
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:06,810
And the idea of hitting my wife is so
completely out of the idea of what's

2034
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:09,090
possible.
It's,

2035
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,910
I wonder what my feelings would be if I
didn't grow up in a house with violence.

2036
01:47:14,911 --> 01:47:18,720
I wonder if I wouldn't be so repulsive
to me having actually physically

2037
01:47:18,721 --> 01:47:22,200
experienced it in person up close.
But I did, you know, so I was,

2038
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:27,150
I was inexorably the, that that's,
that's a part of my psyche,

2039
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:30,240
you know, that's that, that,
that being a negative thing,

2040
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:34,830
that being a horrific crime.
And there's also just a weakness.

2041
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:39,750
I can never forgive a man that's willing
to do that. To hit a woman like that,

2042
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:43,320
it's just so weak. It's so
incredibly, we just, it's such a,

2043
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:48,180
such a failure of character and such a,
a negative,

2044
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:53,100
selfish impulse to hit
someone like that. It's, uh,

2045
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:57,500
you know, it's, it's one of the
major things it's wrong in, in,

2046
01:47:57,501 --> 01:48:01,530
in human interaction is the
ability to hurt each other too.

2047
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,850
To want and leave,

2048
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:06,930
to just reach out and injure each other.

2049
01:48:06,931 --> 01:48:11,500
And then he didn't express
our ignorance and such a, uh,

2050
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,410
a violent and selfish way.

2051
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:16,300
Yeah. And I, I feel that,
I'm sure you do too,

2052
01:48:16,301 --> 01:48:20,530
but I feel that even more strongly with
parents to kids who is so much bigger,

2053
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:21,710
you know,
that your wife can,

2054
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:24,510
my wife can leave me your wife and leave
you anytime. If you're a jerk, right?

2055
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:27,430
Your kids can't think of no way to
go. They got, they can't just say,

2056
01:48:27,431 --> 01:48:28,700
well that's it. You know, I'm, I'm,

2057
01:48:28,701 --> 01:48:31,870
I'm getting a divorce from you dad
and I'm going to go find a better dad.

2058
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:34,930
Or they have no where to go. They
have no choice. There are so tiny.

2059
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:38,590
And I think mine, it's always makes you
smaller than you're a victim. You know,

2060
01:48:38,591 --> 01:48:40,870
and I,
I kept kind of ne four year old,

2061
01:48:40,871 --> 01:48:44,560
I mean you really so far out of options
as an adult with all the choice in the

2062
01:48:44,561 --> 01:48:47,590
world that you actually have to end
up hitting someone. So tiny dependent,

2063
01:48:47,591 --> 01:48:48,424
I mean that makes you

2064
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:52,210
smaller than that was really some account
of a guy who was losing custody of his

2065
01:48:52,211 --> 01:48:53,810
child and um,
the,

2066
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:58,850
the him and the wife had gotten divorced
and I was reading this articulate,

2067
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:04,120
well written account of the horrors of
the legal system until I came upon this

2068
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:07,390
thing where he said that his daughter
went back, the daughter was three,

2069
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:11,530
went back to the wife and told of a mild
spanking that he gave her. And I'm like,

2070
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:16,030
Oh, you're a douche bag. You're
aligned. Douche bag or a piece of shit.

2071
01:49:16,031 --> 01:49:17,200
You spank your baby.

2072
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:22,240
And what you're doing here is manipulating
reality with your blog to try to

2073
01:49:22,241 --> 01:49:25,330
paint yourself out to be a
victim. You're fucking kid, man.

2074
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:27,430
I don't care if it's a mild spanking,
you know,

2075
01:49:27,431 --> 01:49:30,850
mildly spank a fucking three year old
when you're a grown man. It's nonsense.

2076
01:49:30,851 --> 01:49:33,820
It's crazy. You don't have to do
that. They throw a temper Tantrum,

2077
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:35,050
hover over them,

2078
01:49:35,051 --> 01:49:39,910
communicate with them until it's over
and then give them a hug no matter what.

2079
01:49:39,911 --> 01:49:43,000
And this is when I know it gets
frustrating. It's been fresh.

2080
01:49:43,001 --> 01:49:44,730
I've had frustrations and what,

2081
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:48,040
that's the number one thing that
I always do when I, with my kids,

2082
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,620
I always tell them,
when I was your age,

2083
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:55,240
I was even worse at that when I was
your age. I just to lie all the time.

2084
01:49:55,390 --> 01:50:00,130
When I was your age, I used to do this
all the time. I always wanted to be first.

2085
01:50:00,131 --> 01:50:02,740
I always was selfish.
I wanted to have all the toys.

2086
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:06,130
But then I realized that when you
share it toys, it makes it better.

2087
01:50:06,131 --> 01:50:08,130
It's hard to realize
that as a four year rule,

2088
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,660
but one day you're going to figure it
out and that's why I'm telling it to you

2089
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:15,050
and, but I have, you know, I
have a lot of time. I have a,

2090
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:17,200
I'm a relaxed person.

2091
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:21,820
I'm not constantly under the pressure
to perform in life and like to,

2092
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:25,060
to, you know, to do better. I'm
in a good financial position.

2093
01:50:25,061 --> 01:50:26,560
I'm in a good relationship position.

2094
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:30,650
When I see people that are stressed out
by life and then life is overwhelming in

2095
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:33,790
the legs and it's like,
it's almost like they're,

2096
01:50:33,791 --> 01:50:37,900
they're overwhelmed by their plate
and it's terrible. I'm a child.

2097
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,220
Yeah. I always want to my daughter
to remember that I was a kid too.

2098
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:43,630
And that's what you're talking about.

2099
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:46,480
I don't want her to think that I'm some
giant authority figure that is in her

2100
01:50:46,481 --> 01:50:48,990
life. In fact, I told her
so much about my child did,

2101
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,940
she likes to play with me
as a kid. He goes, okay,

2102
01:50:51,941 --> 01:50:52,990
I want to play with little staff.

2103
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:56,980
And then she wants me to come into the
room as little staff and play that way.

2104
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:59,350
And I think that's great cause
I wanted you to remember that.

2105
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:02,500
And I think the God, if we could
just fix language, you know,

2106
01:51:02,501 --> 01:51:04,690
if you can fix language,
I think we'd fix so much in the world.

2107
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:05,790
There's an old confusion saying,

2108
01:51:05,791 --> 01:51:09,310
it says at the beginning of wisdom is
to call things by their proper names.

2109
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:12,750
I hate the word bank. Just say,
yeah. You know, just say, Hey,

2110
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:17,140
I hit my head a mild spank and come on.
I mean, don't call it war colon murder.

2111
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:21,040
That's what it is. Spanking. Yeah. Don't
call it a rest. Call it kidnapping.

2112
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:23,320
Don't call it taxation.
Call it theft. I mean,

2113
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:26,410
just use the proper words for things.
And we'd solve so many problems.

2114
01:51:26,411 --> 01:51:28,390
Euphemisms are, you know, they just,

2115
01:51:28,391 --> 01:51:31,150
the plaque in the arteries of the
brain that confused so many people.

2116
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:34,030
You hit your child. It's not as
banking, we say while it's mild,

2117
01:51:34,031 --> 01:51:36,340
it's just a little swat on the button.
Oh No, no, no. If you're spanking,

2118
01:51:36,341 --> 01:51:38,560
it's to deter behavior
is to change behavior,

2119
01:51:38,561 --> 01:51:40,120
which means the child
has to hate and fear it.

2120
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:42,640
And I wish people would
just be honest about it,

2121
01:51:42,641 --> 01:51:45,460
but they can't even be honest
with themselves. And then
they get mad at the kids.

2122
01:51:45,461 --> 01:51:46,090
For me,

2123
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:49,060
I agree that the categorization and this,
this,

2124
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:52,540
this thing that we do where we make
one thing better than another thing,

2125
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:56,770
even though it's exactly the same,
like spanking is better than, you know,

2126
01:51:56,771 --> 01:52:00,190
but they're the same goddamn thing.
You know? Like how about this?

2127
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,020
I mean it's sort of unrelated,

2128
01:52:02,021 --> 01:52:06,990
but not really this thing
that's going on with with this,

2129
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:11,740
the pouring of chemical weapons that
somehow another murdering people with

2130
01:52:11,741 --> 01:52:16,120
chemicals in that fashion is
way worse than using drones.

2131
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:21,330
These robots that shoot Hellfire
missiles into buildings and killed 98%

2132
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:25,360
innocent,
90% women and children.

2133
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,600
There's that. Is that the actual
statistic is that 80% Jesus

2134
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:32,460
there, they're so bad at
killing only the targets.

2135
01:52:32,461 --> 01:52:35,190
Like the idea that these
are pinpoint precise.

2136
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,040
It's fucking terrifying shit.

2137
01:52:38,041 --> 01:52:43,041
But yet Obama will be on TV talking
about how these chemical weapons,

2138
01:52:43,771 --> 01:52:47,030
we have to deplore the of a father holy,

2139
01:52:47,031 --> 01:52:50,240
his children begging for them to
get up when the mother fucking kids,

2140
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:51,860
you blew up from the sky.

2141
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:57,190
What about rockets launched from robots
like some Orwellian nightmare flying

2142
01:52:57,651 --> 01:53:01,730
around cities with night vision where
someone's got a remote controller in

2143
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:06,560
Nevada and they're pressing the fire
button and launching these missiles. The,

2144
01:53:06,561 --> 01:53:11,270
the, the, the, you know, this, this idea
that we need to take military action.

2145
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:14,600
We need to kill because
people have killed, you know,

2146
01:53:14,601 --> 01:53:17,790
we need to go murder innocence
because innocence have been very good.

2147
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:20,610
Can I Syrian? So to solve that, we're
going to kill some more Syrians,

2148
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,150
Syrians not to kill the,
yeah.

2149
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:25,550
And we're going to do it with pinpoints
strikes when meanwhile they know for a

2150
01:53:25,551 --> 01:53:28,880
fact they're going to move innocence
and civilians into those areas that are

2151
01:53:28,881 --> 01:53:33,110
high risk military targets. They're gonna
move prisoners into those, those areas.

2152
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,750
They're going to up the body count.
You're going to do it on purpose.

2153
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:36,671
And do you know,
I mean,

2154
01:53:36,671 --> 01:53:39,580
the terrifying thing about it's
not just the American weapons,

2155
01:53:39,581 --> 01:53:43,690
it's modern weapons in general is the
fact that they will fuck with entire

2156
01:53:43,691 --> 01:53:48,220
populations. Genetics. Like this is
something I just, I just did this, um,

2157
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,480
study up this sort of
review the Syrian staff,

2158
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:55,810
Americans outrage and chemical weapons
and neat without even getting into

2159
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:59,560
Vietnam where millions of people were
destroyed by these unbelievably horrendous

2160
01:53:59,561 --> 01:54:03,370
weapons. The only thing America didn't
use was mustard gas and nuclear weapons.

2161
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:03,971
Everything else.

2162
01:54:03,971 --> 01:54:08,820
They just through from Amr stand on this
population in Fallujah in 2007 they use

2163
01:54:08,821 --> 01:54:09,680
this white phosphorous,

2164
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:13,450
which is basically just exploding the Lou
that melts human beings and they just,

2165
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:17,860
it's fired indiscriminately into the
city and they use these depleted uranium

2166
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:20,830
shells because they're good at piercing
armor of which there really wasn't much

2167
01:54:20,831 --> 01:54:21,760
of interact anyway.

2168
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:26,140
But this stuff has a half life longer
than the planet itself and it's so screws

2169
01:54:26,141 --> 01:54:29,200
with the genetics of the
population because it goes
into the desk that goes into

2170
01:54:29,201 --> 01:54:33,850
the lungs have been a 600% increase in
leukemia and in the years after this

2171
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:38,620
Volusia attack run by America binding
by the special forces by the army,

2172
01:54:39,370 --> 01:54:42,990
50% of the children were born with
birth defects. And, uh, again,

2173
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,350
a geneticists who's kind of studied the
city says that he's never seen a more

2174
01:54:47,351 --> 01:54:48,071
compromised.

2175
01:54:48,071 --> 01:54:51,070
It's a nice way of putting it basically
more fucked up genetic population.

2176
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,320
This is going to go on for generations.

2177
01:54:53,321 --> 01:54:55,840
These genes have been completely
destroyed by these weapons.

2178
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:57,720
And then they're saying,
well,

2179
01:54:57,730 --> 01:55:01,990
you know this guy in Syria as see
he use these chemical weapons.

2180
01:55:01,991 --> 01:55:02,824
Then someone is like,

2181
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:06,430
but at least that stuff is not going to
completely rewrite the genetic code of

2182
01:55:06,431 --> 01:55:08,050
the population for generations to come.

2183
01:55:08,210 --> 01:55:11,320
Or they deny the use of depleted uranium
even though there's a lot of evidence

2184
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:13,360
that shows that they
used it in Serbia too.

2185
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:17,470
I had to apologize to people because I
was talking about where they used all

2186
01:55:17,471 --> 01:55:20,250
these depleted uranium and all these
guys from Serbia. Right, and say what?

2187
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:22,180
We don't count.
I mean come on and we will with,

2188
01:55:22,181 --> 01:55:23,830
they used it with us too
with the same effects

2189
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,450
and then that's also the cross of this,
this,

2190
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:30,110
this Gulf War syndrome that all these
people have come back was horrible

2191
01:55:30,111 --> 01:55:34,190
illnesses that mirror radiation sickness
and then the government has denied them

2192
01:55:34,191 --> 01:55:38,060
medical treatment, so there's
nothing wrong here. There's
something going on here.

2193
01:55:38,370 --> 01:55:39,150
It says

2194
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:44,040
sad, sad statement that that's how we
are today. Most of the people that I

2195
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,400
need a really nice, they just find
that to be a lot more people than I do.

2196
01:55:47,401 --> 01:55:51,330
They say the average famous person meets
like 10,000 people a year or some crazy

2197
01:55:51,331 --> 01:55:54,490
number. Right. And, but don't you
find that most of the people that you,

2198
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,470
this is the weird thing.

2199
01:55:55,620 --> 01:56:00,620
The world is insane and so full of
like the most soul destroying evil.

2200
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:05,670
Like yet most of the people that I meet
are unbelievably nice. It's a weird,

2201
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,430
I mean like who are these
reptiles who run everything?

2202
01:56:08,431 --> 01:56:11,280
Cause I meet these really nice people
and there's all the horrible stuff in the

2203
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:15,900
news. Well in all fairness, you live here.
Yes, that's true in Toronto. That's true.

2204
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:18,780
I don't live a beautiful place.
Yeah,

2205
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:21,550
it's a lovely place and people are
pretty nice and trying to actualize

2206
01:56:22,430 --> 01:56:24,690
overall I say 20% less

2207
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:28,800
douchebags in Canada than America.
Well you got the BMW factor,

2208
01:56:28,801 --> 01:56:31,860
which we ran into a couple of times
on the drive down the BMW factory.

2209
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,770
You know that old joke about BMW?
What's the difference?

2210
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:38,640
I'm going to tell a joke to go
to a fucking line and a BMW,

2211
01:56:38,641 --> 01:56:41,160
the BMW and the porcupine and
the brakes are on the outside.

2212
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:44,160
So other than the BMW factor,
very,

2213
01:56:44,161 --> 01:56:46,560
very nice people and they must bring
them in from Casa bar or something.

2214
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:50,550
That's also always going to be the case
when people are privileged or when they

2215
01:56:50,551 --> 01:56:53,970
have more money or when they feel like
they've worked harder and the other

2216
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:57,780
people are weak and lazy. You get the
fuck out of my way. I've got the Mercedes.

2217
01:56:58,190 --> 01:57:01,010
People love to think that the accidents
of birth, their personal virtues,

2218
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:03,740
I mean then it's all, you know,
it gets a lot of, you know,

2219
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:06,740
a lot of people who make it big,
you know, like put in a Poncho.

2220
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:09,410
Isn't there a godfather like Steven
Spielberg or something like that.

2221
01:57:09,411 --> 01:57:11,240
And she's a talented actress,
a lovely lady,

2222
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:14,690
but she got a bit of a leg
up in the business. Right?
But a lot of people like, oh,

2223
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:16,910
you know,
I happen to be born to this great family.

2224
01:57:16,911 --> 01:57:19,760
I happened to be born in the west. When
you and I am born in Kenya. I mean,

2225
01:57:19,761 --> 01:57:21,980
what the hell are we
going to do with time?

2226
01:57:21,981 --> 01:57:23,870
The rubber tires to
our feet to run around.

2227
01:57:23,871 --> 01:57:28,871
And I mean it's so much of the good stuff
in our life is kind of accidental 100%

2228
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:33,440
and you always take that
for personal virtue is a,

2229
01:57:33,441 --> 01:57:37,310
is a really great failing cause it
really kills your empathy. The flip side,

2230
01:57:37,311 --> 01:57:38,500
it's also a,

2231
01:57:38,530 --> 01:57:41,510
an incredible weakness that people have
when they point to successful people

2232
01:57:41,511 --> 01:57:45,010
going, oh they go look, you
know? Yeah, it's good enough.

2233
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:48,230
If I got a funny every 10 years
you end up in a lot of lack, right.

2234
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:52,190
Bust her ass and then you get lock all
the time. It's weird cause I, you know,

2235
01:57:52,191 --> 01:57:52,881
in your life,

2236
01:57:52,881 --> 01:57:57,050
of course you find here's a standup before
you got anywhere near TV or anything.

2237
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:00,830
I got right. In that sense I got
super lucky cause that's really rare.

2238
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:04,580
It's really rare to get on a hit sitcom
when you're five years in a stand up.

2239
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,270
Well yes.
But I bet you when you got that Sitcom,

2240
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:09,880
you work pretty hard and rough.

2241
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:13,730
I got to coaching from the people who
were more experienced on the sat and you

2242
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:17,600
really, really think about it
as fast as we want you to fail.

2243
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,230
No, it's not hard. It's not an,
it's not a difficult process.

2244
01:58:22,231 --> 01:58:25,080
Color of all the things that
have ever done in my life.

2245
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:26,400
Acting is without a doubt.

2246
01:58:26,401 --> 01:58:29,010
The easiest is that because it's
like other people's words and you,

2247
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,710
you just have to be credible and
hit your mark and it's certainly,

2248
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:35,490
that's a part of it, but it's also, it's
just not that difficult to just pretend.

2249
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:35,941
I mean,

2250
01:58:35,941 --> 01:58:39,120
we all know what happens when someone
gets upset about something would all know

2251
01:58:39,121 --> 01:58:42,360
what happens when someone's confused.
We can pretend and it's your,

2252
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:46,960
it's also when you're,
you're acting, you're, it's,

2253
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:52,300
you're, you have chance to do it over
again. If you fuck it up, it's not hard.

2254
01:58:52,301 --> 01:58:55,720
It's coming from martial arts and
then coming from standup comedy,

2255
01:58:55,721 --> 01:58:56,554
those two things.
Yeah,

2256
01:58:56,650 --> 01:59:00,120
but you don't get to walk back and say, I
do that joke again. Maybe once, you know,

2257
01:59:00,121 --> 01:59:02,670
but after that, people are like, well,
he's not, he's just screwing up, man.

2258
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:06,050
I got to wake up from being knocked
out and we're going to fight again.

2259
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,350
Ice On my head.
Mulligan we do.

2260
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,890
Right then. Not only that, it's,

2261
01:59:11,891 --> 01:59:15,440
it's one of those things that
when you see someone on a camera,

2262
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:16,780
you see them on a screen,

2263
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:21,080
see them and this weird Alpha Male,

2264
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:26,140
those primate thing that we have where
we think that the person who gets to talk

2265
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:30,530
especial the person that's
on camera special because
like that would be like the

2266
01:59:30,531 --> 01:59:32,600
leader of the tribe or something.
There's this weird,

2267
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:37,210
it's the sort of hijacked
our human reward system with,

2268
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:40,070
with media.
And so because of that,

2269
01:59:40,130 --> 01:59:42,800
when you see someone who's
on film and someone's crying,

2270
01:59:42,810 --> 01:59:46,310
you give them incredible accolades. You
are amazing. That film to change my life,

2271
01:59:46,311 --> 01:59:49,820
it was amazing. All it is, pretend
they pretending to be a murderer there.

2272
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:52,540
I do what it does it for 12 hours a day.
So not hard.

2273
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:55,480
Anything a four year old can do.
And I think Marlon Brando who said that,

2274
01:59:55,481 --> 01:59:57,970
you know, anything that four year olds,
Shirley temple, he was talking about,

2275
01:59:57,971 --> 01:59:59,740
you know,
anything full year old can do,

2276
01:59:59,741 --> 02:00:03,430
I'm not sure we should get big prizes
for watch Ricky Schroder and the champ,

2277
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:05,930
it was like six years old
and he's fucking incredible.

2278
02:00:05,931 --> 02:00:08,460
The job like mine to sixth
sense, Dylan, hey on this,

2279
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:11,860
I remember that kid just gives you
goosebumps to see. It's not hard to

2280
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:15,210
do and it's not something
that requires like,

2281
02:00:15,330 --> 02:00:19,140
like learning to play the piano or
learning to speak French requires a lot of

2282
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:22,490
brain surgery or stuff, which
is really significant. You know,

2283
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:25,230
standup comedies infinitely
harder than acting.

2284
02:00:25,231 --> 02:00:29,430
And then granted I was
acting in a very limited way.

2285
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:32,310
I was doing a sitcom, which is one
of the more limited forms of acting,

2286
02:00:32,730 --> 02:00:37,120
but we also created a lot of the
dialogue and effect. Dave Foley, um,

2287
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:41,790
was probably responsible for maybe 50%
of everything that got made on that show.

2288
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:42,211
Is that right?

2289
02:00:42,211 --> 02:00:46,290
He was like a secret producer because he
was such a brilliant guy and so good at

2290
02:00:46,291 --> 02:00:48,600
ad libbing that when he
would do is we would,

2291
02:00:48,601 --> 02:00:53,040
we had an amazing executive producer,
Paul Sams, brilliant, brilliant guy,

2292
02:00:53,041 --> 02:00:53,940
and created the show,

2293
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:56,760
the head writer and executive producer
and a great writing staff as well.

2294
02:00:56,761 --> 02:01:00,330
But Paul was really open to us experiment.
And so he would,

2295
02:01:00,331 --> 02:01:02,370
they would give us a framework,
they'd give us a script,

2296
02:01:02,371 --> 02:01:06,090
but Dave would rewrite entire scenes.
And so,

2297
02:01:06,091 --> 02:01:10,060
so much of what we do on that show
was ad libbed almost maybe 50%. Right.

2298
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:14,760
So it wasn't just about reading
people's lines being easier.

2299
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:19,920
It's just an easier gig. It's,
it's easy. It's like, so my, um,

2300
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:22,320
my stumbling into a sitcom,

2301
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:27,480
it was because of a bunch of lucky
factors wouldn't lock number one that they

2302
02:01:27,481 --> 02:01:30,090
saw me on MTV and they
saw I got this on my,

2303
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:35,180
my comedy special or be half hour comedy
hour when I was on a television show

2304
02:01:36,481 --> 02:01:39,150
where I did like 10 minutes.
They saw that and it went well.

2305
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:42,470
And then I got these opportunities.
So just opened up from that.

2306
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:46,250
And then this show came about and then
I got on it and it was a show that was

2307
02:01:46,251 --> 02:01:48,860
already created. So it was
all luck. That was all luck.

2308
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:52,850
And the idea that you get that successful
after five years of doing standup is

2309
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:56,960
really, really rare. So I
can't take any credit for that.

2310
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:58,160
But then from there,

2311
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:02,140
yeah, for the area and even that, I mean
to, to do the half at MTV special ed,

2312
02:02:02,141 --> 02:02:04,660
but it was a hell of a lot of work and
that comes out of the years on the road

2313
02:02:04,661 --> 02:02:07,270
and no one had to work in the audience
and the timing and what works and what

2314
02:02:07,271 --> 02:02:08,290
doesn't and all that.
So

2315
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:12,930
that's all work. Anybody who is good at
standup, that shit does not come here. No.

2316
02:02:13,150 --> 02:02:15,070
No one who gets up there and can,

2317
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:19,330
can kill an audience of strangers.
That's all work.

2318
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:23,320
You just can't do it from the beginning.
Yeah. Anybody who gets that, you know,

2319
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:26,410
lots of agro tries just, just go
give it a shot. I wouldn't, you know,

2320
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:27,940
they do it once.

2321
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:31,300
Maybe you will have a couple of good
lines that you've accumulated or do you

2322
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:33,220
have, uh, developed over
the course of your life?

2323
02:02:33,221 --> 02:02:35,480
Some observations that you think are
really fun and you wrote them down.

2324
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:38,740
They might be valid, they might be good.
And then my work a couple of times,

2325
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:42,440
but not when people are paying, you
know, people pay 30 bucks for a ticket,

2326
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,300
you know,
one after another.

2327
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:47,690
I mean I was just amazed because the
hour and 20 that you were on stage last

2328
02:02:47,690 --> 02:02:51,530
night I flew by for me, you know, at
a match. Are you saying it the coach,

2329
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:54,890
do you remember? It kind of flew by to
you. But I'm thinking the amount of work,

2330
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,770
I mean the amount of material that's
written and discarded and tested and

2331
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:58,221
discarded,

2332
02:02:58,221 --> 02:03:01,610
the amount of concentrated work that does
an hour and 20 of making people laugh.

2333
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:06,110
But that's it. I mean men
typically I spoke last night,
huge amount of work entity

2334
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,550
when I'm not working on other things.

2335
02:03:08,551 --> 02:03:11,730
If I'm not doing the UFC or if
I'm not working on my podcast,

2336
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:15,810
I am always thinking of stuff like,
is this funny as it's interesting,

2337
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:17,250
but it's also,
I've,

2338
02:03:17,430 --> 02:03:21,090
I've kind of designed my life in that.

2339
02:03:21,091 --> 02:03:24,690
The creation of material outside of
the actual sitting down in front of the

2340
02:03:24,691 --> 02:03:27,480
computer and writing, which is critical.
You have to, it has to be done.

2341
02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:32,100
That's one of the things that a lot of
lazy comedians don't do post its and

2342
02:03:32,101 --> 02:03:34,500
stuff like that. You can't just
do that. You have to do both.

2343
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:37,860
You have to do the writing down
notes and stuff is important too.

2344
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:42,540
But the actual sitting down and crafting
the bits and putting them in order and

2345
02:03:42,541 --> 02:03:46,110
figuring out a way you free ball when
you're on stage and let it come when it's

2346
02:03:46,111 --> 02:03:46,531
on stage.

2347
02:03:46,531 --> 02:03:49,940
Because when you're on stage you never
know what the hell can happen but this

2348
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:51,300
you have to be in the moment.

2349
02:03:51,301 --> 02:03:53,700
Like when the guy came up to me at the
beginning of the show and handed me the

2350
02:03:53,701 --> 02:03:55,200
hockey puck or what
the fuck are you doing?

2351
02:03:55,470 --> 02:03:58,770
And then it became like five minutes
of me goofing on this guy. But it was,

2352
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:02,820
I had to do it. It was this is,
this is the thing that happened.

2353
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:05,310
You know this is, but it's also,
it's stitching everything together.

2354
02:04:05,370 --> 02:04:08,460
It's the bridges between the stories
that I was watching for last night.

2355
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:10,290
How do you get from one bit to another,

2356
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:13,170
and I hate the word bit cause it just
sounds like such an insignificant thing,

2357
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:17,370
but that's what we call them. Yeah.
So getting logically from one,

2358
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:20,670
one bit to another. Is it real? How
do you audit them? How'd you feel?

2359
02:04:20,910 --> 02:04:23,760
Do that. Because if you
don't, people don't want to
follow your train of thought.

2360
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:24,930
The when you're doing,

2361
02:04:24,931 --> 02:04:27,210
when you're doing your
standard performance is not
just telling you a bunch of

2362
02:04:27,211 --> 02:04:29,190
jokes, but you're borrowing
someone's consciousness,

2363
02:04:29,490 --> 02:04:33,060
you borrowing someone's mind and the
only way it really works as if someone

2364
02:04:33,061 --> 02:04:35,780
trusts you enough,
your thoughts are as the there.

2365
02:04:35,810 --> 02:04:40,010
They're there as as they can
be. They're unique. They're,

2366
02:04:40,011 --> 02:04:43,410
they're surprising. They're stimulating
to the point where someone saying, okay,

2367
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,930
take me on this rod through your mind.
Take me on this ride.

2368
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:50,130
Because if you're talking like I've seen
a million comedians and there's so many

2369
02:04:50,131 --> 02:04:52,900
that I've seen that they start talking
and I go, okay, get the fuck out again.

2370
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:57,150
I can't listen to this guys mind because
what he's doing is he's got like a one

2371
02:04:57,151 --> 02:05:00,960
stop. Like his premises are
short. They're, they're obvious,

2372
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:03,310
they don't mail is nicely,
which is a challenge.

2373
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,350
And there's, there's no depth
to, the thought is there's
no unique point of view.

2374
02:05:07,351 --> 02:05:08,200
There's nothing there.

2375
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:11,040
They haven't done the work or they're not
capable of doing the work. What did we,

2376
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:14,500
whichever one it is, I gotta get Outta
here cause I can't give them my mind.

2377
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:15,410
You know?

2378
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:18,230
Now do you want us, cause you
know, you talk about, you know,

2379
02:05:18,231 --> 02:05:21,860
being a positive force in people's lives
and bringing happiness and you suddenly

2380
02:05:21,861 --> 02:05:26,730
get that last night. Do you
want to lead the witness? Right?

2381
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:31,730
Do you want people to come out
of your show better? Why Sir? No.

2382
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:34,160
How do you want them to
come out of the shell?

2383
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:36,620
Like it's not just having
to calorie entertainment,

2384
02:05:36,621 --> 02:05:39,960
that's all I would argue that you
actually do put some, you do puts,

2385
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:42,560
I mean you're selling, you're intelligent
enough to put some real wisdom,

2386
02:05:42,561 --> 02:05:44,000
I think into what you do.

2387
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:49,070
And I think that people can come out
of your shelves with some interesting

2388
02:05:49,071 --> 02:05:50,750
connections that they
hadn't thought of before.

2389
02:05:50,751 --> 02:05:52,310
I'm not saying you're an educator,
obviously,

2390
02:05:52,311 --> 02:05:55,720
but I think that there's stuff that
can, it's not just a burger, you know,

2391
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:58,550
it's not empty calories. Right. Cause
there's a lot of thought in what you do.

2392
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:02,610
Well, um, last night's
said was particularly, uh,

2393
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:06,500
rich and ideas because some of the new
things that I've been working on are, um,

2394
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:11,930
there's a lot of stuff that I'm working
on about the sort of a weirdness of

2395
02:06:11,931 --> 02:06:14,060
progressive thought later,
like this,

2396
02:06:14,061 --> 02:06:18,500
a really aggressive progressiveness
that's going on where people are denying

2397
02:06:18,501 --> 02:06:20,480
reality and they're doing it.

2398
02:06:20,481 --> 02:06:24,020
So because they feel like people
have been marginalized in the past,

2399
02:06:24,021 --> 02:06:24,854
which is true,

2400
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:28,100
but it doesn't mean you spring it back
the other way and say a bunch of stupid

2401
02:06:28,101 --> 02:06:29,060
shit.
It doesn't make any sense.

2402
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:32,150
Oh, you judge people too harshly for
judging people harshly. It's like, yeah,

2403
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:35,970
how does that work? Getting people
for hit it. Exactly. Right. Exactly.

2404
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:38,070
And some of the most aggressive
people I know are liberals,

2405
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:41,580
so it's really strange.
I mean there's an amazing video of,

2406
02:06:41,581 --> 02:06:42,840
of University of Toronto,

2407
02:06:42,841 --> 02:06:47,650
of this guy who was speaking about
men's rights wiring foul is it?

2408
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:49,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2409
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:54,590
These feminists are protesting these
students screaming in their face.

2410
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:59,570
The students that want to go see
this man talk about women's Oh,

2411
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:03,300
about men's rights and about
that you hate women and all this,

2412
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:07,530
and they're incredibly aggressive.
Younger hate I see is in the protesters.

2413
02:07:07,531 --> 02:07:12,130
The only not good with, and by the way,
incredibly ignorant to what this guy,

2414
02:07:12,131 --> 02:07:15,330
his actual words are,
and they weren't even aware.

2415
02:07:15,331 --> 02:07:17,250
They didn't even bother
doing the research.

2416
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:21,300
They didn't even bother formulating a
true opinion on these this guy's ideas.

2417
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:24,810
They just decided that this guy
hates women and that's a weird thing.

2418
02:07:24,811 --> 02:07:29,811
Like I've had made some posts about
feminism on online before and one of the

2419
02:07:29,821 --> 02:07:34,821
things that I've found it
incredibly strange is that
I got called an Mra asshole

2420
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,630
and so I go, what does it, what
does that mean? What's the Mra?

2421
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:42,700
So that I had the events that be fighting.
I didn't know what it meant at all.

2422
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:47,560
It's men's rights advocate or
an activist and I was like,

2423
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:50,290
wait a minute.
A feminist,

2424
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:55,710
a person who wants equal rights for women
is saying that being a man who wants

2425
02:07:57,821 --> 02:08:00,370
equal rights for men is an idiot.

2426
02:08:00,371 --> 02:08:04,510
Or I could call the Dodo and Mra
Dodo and I'm like, oh Jesus Christ.

2427
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:07,450
Like love as a compressed
Socratic argument.

2428
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:11,560
I could call an MRA asshole worried
toto and I didn't even know what an MRI,

2429
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:15,460
I mean I'm not a men's rights advocate
by any stretch of imagination.

2430
02:08:15,461 --> 02:08:18,430
I don't visit any blogs,
I don't visit any forums,

2431
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:23,550
but I'm a believer in equality as far
as like the laws and regulations as they

2432
02:08:24,341 --> 02:08:28,360
apply to human beings and I do not believe
that the laws and regulations as they

2433
02:08:28,361 --> 02:08:32,530
apply to human beings in this country
aren't even for men as the and women.

2434
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:36,190
I don't think they're even for women
and I don't think they're even for men.

2435
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:40,840
I think the three fourths laws are fucking
horrendous for men and some of them

2436
02:08:40,841 --> 02:08:44,040
are atrocious.
Some of them are Canada or God awful.

2437
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:48,730
Dave Foley for the longest time.
I don't know if he's resolved a horrible,

2438
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:53,650
anybody who's listening to this, just
Google Day Foley, Joe Experience divorce.

2439
02:08:53,651 --> 02:08:54,101
And there's a,

2440
02:08:54,101 --> 02:08:58,290
there's a youtube video that someone
compiled of just him talking about his

2441
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:03,190
divorce. It will make your head spin.
And, and I know that because TV,

2442
02:09:03,570 --> 02:09:07,720
because what? He lost $10
million in his last divorce.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. As he said,

2443
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:12,130
it's not alimony. It's all your money. I
mean, that's a, it is. It is. It's insane.

2444
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:16,240
It's insane. And that's not fair. It's
not fair. I don't care what anybody says.

2445
02:09:16,430 --> 02:09:19,510
I think that absolutely.
If a man and woman get divorced,

2446
02:09:19,511 --> 02:09:21,280
the match pay child support.
Absolutely.

2447
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:24,610
And if the woman was not working
during the time of the marriage,

2448
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:27,490
I think there should be some sort
of compensation, something fair.

2449
02:09:27,491 --> 02:09:28,211
It's something reasonably,

2450
02:09:28,211 --> 02:09:31,330
that's some of the assets
that he developed by focusing
on whatever. Yeah, sure.

2451
02:09:31,450 --> 02:09:35,500
Absolutely. But there's a terrible
payments. That's just not right. It's not.

2452
02:09:35,501 --> 02:09:39,610
It's not right. And I have a friend who
has to pay his ex wife. Um, they were,

2453
02:09:39,611 --> 02:09:40,870
they were married for 12 years.

2454
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,020
He has to pay her for the rest of
her life until she gets married.

2455
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:45,220
So she plays this game.

2456
02:09:45,221 --> 02:09:48,880
She has a boyfriend and the boyfriend
that was of her and he sends a,

2457
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:52,480
the investigators over to figure it out
and the boyfriend's not there and then

2458
02:09:52,481 --> 02:09:54,940
he leaves and the investigators leave in,

2459
02:09:54,941 --> 02:09:57,990
the boyfriend moves back in and so
he has to continue paying it like,

2460
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:02,350
like she's cohabitating with a man and
he still has to continue to send her

2461
02:10:02,351 --> 02:10:04,480
money. And it's just a
manipulation of the legal system.

2462
02:10:04,481 --> 02:10:07,240
And this guy has paper millions and
millions and millions of dollars.

2463
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:10,300
She's in his $4 million
Pacific Palisades home.

2464
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:12,670
I mean it crippled him financially.

2465
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:15,700
And on top of that he had a pay for
her lawyer, whether they want to,

2466
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:18,400
it's gone through divorce and
here's where it gets really crazy.

2467
02:10:18,401 --> 02:10:22,000
She went to every lawyer in
town and consulted with them,

2468
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:26,680
every good lawyer in town that she knew
of so that he could never use them as

2469
02:10:26,681 --> 02:10:29,200
counsel. Oh. Because there'd
be conflict of interest.

2470
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:33,620
This is madness. I mean, she planned out,

2471
02:10:33,621 --> 02:10:37,010
she planned this divorce out for a
long time, was incredibly calculating.

2472
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:42,400
And the idea that men don't deserve
rights and because of the fact that women

2473
02:10:42,891 --> 02:10:45,050
have been marginalized, which
is true, they have been.

2474
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:47,630
But that doesn't mean that men
haven't been either. I mean,

2475
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:52,520
human beings deserve to be treated
fairly. That's, that's true to you.

2476
02:10:52,521 --> 02:10:56,600
You deserve, everyone deserves to be
treated humanely. I don't believe men are,

2477
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,630
I don't believe women are,
I don't believe humans are.

2478
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:04,400
But the idea that you could separate and
be a feminist, but be anti men's rights,

2479
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:08,180
well, you're a fucking crazy person
then. You know, you're not a humanist.

2480
02:11:08,181 --> 02:11:11,060
You're not a person who's looking at
all human beings as your brothers and

2481
02:11:11,061 --> 02:11:15,920
sisters. You're a person with that agenda.
You're a, a person with an ideology.

2482
02:11:15,921 --> 02:11:17,690
And that ideology is
that you're on a team,

2483
02:11:17,691 --> 02:11:21,230
you're on team vagina and everything
that's on the penis can go fuck itself.

2484
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:23,510
And that was the, that
was the, the feedback.

2485
02:11:23,511 --> 02:11:27,530
The blow back that I got for
a joke about male feminists.

2486
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:28,221
Yeah.
No,

2487
02:11:28,221 --> 02:11:31,250
I mean I've stepped on that landmine a
couple of times and I keep going back to

2488
02:11:31,251 --> 02:11:34,550
it. Cause it is, it is an important one.
Uh, you know, men in the legal system,

2489
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:35,640
I mean not just the divorce,

2490
02:11:35,641 --> 02:11:37,910
but I mean the sentencing
disparities between men and women,

2491
02:11:37,911 --> 02:11:40,670
like they called it pussy pass, you
know, I mean it's, it's horrendous.

2492
02:11:41,150 --> 02:11:43,040
Call Feminism Marxists with pennies

2493
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:46,680
because I socialism socialism,
socialism with tits.

2494
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:49,770
But that was a bad character
in one of my novels.

2495
02:11:50,050 --> 02:11:53,160
But now I just go on the feminism,
socialism and panties.

2496
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:56,250
And it's very true because I mean,
and then people call, oh my God,

2497
02:11:56,251 --> 02:11:57,110
that's so terrible.
It's not,

2498
02:11:57,111 --> 02:12:00,060
I just went through all the founding
matriarchs of the feminist system.

2499
02:12:00,061 --> 02:12:03,030
They're all Marxists, all
leftist and so on. And also,

2500
02:12:03,031 --> 02:12:07,710
if feminist is so pro woman, then
where are they with Margaret Thatcher?

2501
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:10,980
Margaret Thatcher was like the
first leader of a Western country.

2502
02:12:10,981 --> 02:12:14,100
She struggled up from nothing.
I made him incredibly powerful woman,

2503
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:18,260
but she was on the right QC. So they
hate her. What about Iran? Iran wrote,

2504
02:12:18,270 --> 02:12:20,940
wrote the most influential
book outside the Bible.

2505
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:25,590
And the second most influential book in
according to The New York Times review

2506
02:12:25,890 --> 02:12:27,840
of books after the Bible, uh, you know,

2507
02:12:27,841 --> 02:12:31,950
reshaped a western philosophy in many
ways and western politics and the

2508
02:12:31,951 --> 02:12:34,260
feminists hate or why?
Cause she was on the right cause he's,

2509
02:12:34,261 --> 02:12:34,921
that's what they think.

2510
02:12:34,921 --> 02:12:38,790
She was not actually on the right but so
I mean I have these sorts of suspicions

2511
02:12:38,791 --> 02:12:42,840
when there is sort of the, is it the
leftist ideology or the pro woman?

2512
02:12:43,050 --> 02:12:45,870
Now if it's the pro woman then
they should be incredibly positive.

2513
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:50,160
Where are the feminist when people
insult people like Ann Coulter,

2514
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:54,040
where are the feminists? When
people insult Sarah Palin,
you know, like Bill Maher,

2515
02:12:54,041 --> 02:12:58,620
her called her a cunt. I
mean that's really pretty
vicious. Like publicly, openly,

2516
02:12:58,621 --> 02:13:02,340
right? I mean where are the fee because
they're on the rights and cultural are

2517
02:13:02,370 --> 02:13:05,490
considered to be on the right. So they
get a pass where people go, you know,

2518
02:13:05,491 --> 02:13:07,800
but you then say something
bad about a woman on the left.

2519
02:13:07,801 --> 02:13:11,730
And so I think that it is more left
than it is pro women because when they

2520
02:13:11,731 --> 02:13:13,980
choose between their
politics and the gender,

2521
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:16,320
they always seem to choose
the politics over the agenda.

2522
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:18,900
And that's why I say it's left
as rather than than pro woman.

2523
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:20,580
I agree.
And I think there's,

2524
02:13:20,581 --> 02:13:25,350
there's a lot of really emotional and
non objective thinking attached to

2525
02:13:25,351 --> 02:13:30,150
feminism and there's a lot of, there's a
lot of really strange. The, the, the, the,

2526
02:13:30,151 --> 02:13:32,130
one of the more ones that I find

2527
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,830
incredibly strange is this,
uh,

2528
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:38,160
there's this new trend of accusing men
of rate if they have sex with a woman

2529
02:13:38,161 --> 02:13:40,870
who's had something to
drink. This is a, uh, like a,

2530
02:13:40,871 --> 02:13:45,780
a broad sweeping thing that's going
through the Internet. And a lot of these,

2531
02:13:45,781 --> 02:13:49,470
uh, it's really weird because it seems
to be, there's a lot of it in this,

2532
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:52,520
what they call a skeptical community.
And I,

2533
02:13:52,530 --> 02:13:57,240
the skeptical community
seems to be integrated with
a lot of male feminists and

2534
02:13:57,241 --> 02:14:01,590
feminist. And this is something that
they've adopted this idea that somehow,

2535
02:14:01,591 --> 02:14:05,480
or another skepticism and this idea,
uh, that they, that they combine.

2536
02:14:05,481 --> 02:14:06,720
And it's,

2537
02:14:07,230 --> 02:14:10,170
I don't know if you're aware of the
case that Michael Shermer thing you know

2538
02:14:10,171 --> 02:14:13,600
about all about cues to some
significant sexual impropriety, right?

2539
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:19,120
No evidence other than a person who
doesn't want to reveal their name.

2540
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:22,900
Who He, the guy who wrote the piece
heard about second hand. Yeah.

2541
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:24,930
He didn't even hear about
it directly from the person.

2542
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:26,450
And this is the person
who's supposed to validate.

2543
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:30,400
They not see like I don't understand is
it makes it, yes, he's getting sued now,

2544
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:33,690
but it's the idea of that
being the skeptic community.

2545
02:14:33,691 --> 02:14:37,920
I mean one of the things you learn as
a skeptic when you're breaking down any

2546
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:42,440
idea, whether it's a religious idea
or whether it's an idea about a,

2547
02:14:42,441 --> 02:14:47,441
an event that took place is that a
person's eye witness account of any

2548
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:52,440
individual event is suspect and
that it's one of the worst forms of,

2549
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:53,580
of evidence.

2550
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:56,340
And it doesn't mean that a terrible
thing didn't happen with this person,

2551
02:14:56,610 --> 02:14:58,410
but it does mean that if you look at the,

2552
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:03,500
in the context of the way it was explained
in this guy's blog is that she was

2553
02:15:03,631 --> 02:15:07,130
put in a position where she
couldn't consent. Like what?

2554
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:10,960
What kind of Weirdo language is that?
And then the,

2555
02:15:10,961 --> 02:15:15,270
the corroborating evidence that he uses
in this blog is that a woman went to a

2556
02:15:15,271 --> 02:15:20,271
party with this guy and he kept giving
her drinks and he was flirty and that she

2557
02:15:20,551 --> 02:15:23,340
got drunker than she usually does.
And that's it.

2558
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:27,690
That's the corroborating piece of evidence
that the man and a woman who are both

2559
02:15:27,691 --> 02:15:32,310
adults were drinking together
and she got drunk. I mean, I,

2560
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:37,080
you talk about removing yourself
from personal responsibility that he,

2561
02:15:37,081 --> 02:15:41,550
this guy was responsible for you
getting drunker. Like that's insane.

2562
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:45,240
Like that's insane for a person
to say this, then we'll be drinks.

2563
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:48,760
What choice did I am a
feminist? Like, why would you,

2564
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:53,810
how is it possible that a person who
believes in the power of being woman could

2565
02:15:54,871 --> 02:15:58,170
think that a woman is so
much weaker than a man?

2566
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,710
That she can't control how much liquor
she consumes when she's around a man,

2567
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:03,150
but the man somehow or another,

2568
02:16:03,151 --> 02:16:07,320
by being with her and drinking with her
forces her to consume what you normally

2569
02:16:07,321 --> 02:16:12,060
would. That's madness. And there's
no excuse called I was drunk. I mean,

2570
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:15,300
try that with drunk driving, right?
It's the whole point. Is that okay? Yes.

2571
02:16:15,301 --> 02:16:17,070
You had diminished capacity
while you were driving,

2572
02:16:17,071 --> 02:16:19,070
but you were responsible for
drinking and getting in the car.

2573
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:23,130
It's the one time when we're willing to
alleviate someone of their own personal

2574
02:16:23,131 --> 02:16:27,510
responsibility and only women.
A man is more of a man who,

2575
02:16:27,511 --> 02:16:30,970
if a man and man is more responsible,
a man of women are dropped together.

2576
02:16:31,090 --> 02:16:34,330
But the woman, uh, it feels bad
about the encounter in the morning.

2577
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:36,970
The man raped her leaving.
All the man was drunk as well.

2578
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,060
But the men are always the aggressors
and always therefore guilty.

2579
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:42,610
I mean that's not humanism,

2580
02:16:42,710 --> 02:16:46,310
but that has taken, and this
is a long dock road, uh,

2581
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:49,340
that as a man and you know,
I'm sorry that if you're a woman,

2582
02:16:49,341 --> 02:16:50,630
it's really hard to get this.

2583
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:55,960
We have had so much negativity over
the past 40 or so years paroled and

2584
02:16:56,361 --> 02:17:00,860
masculinity that, I mean, we were like
half criminals just for breathing. I mean,

2585
02:17:00,861 --> 02:17:04,600
if you look at the, the role models on
TV, how, how men to portray, you know,

2586
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:09,050
the homeless Simpson's and the
American dads and that they take,

2587
02:17:09,051 --> 02:17:13,190
we're all just idiots and sex
craze and irresponsible and stupid.

2588
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:16,010
And the amazing thing is that it's true.

2589
02:17:16,011 --> 02:17:18,860
Then if you look at the bell
curve of intelligence for women,

2590
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:20,100
it's kind of spikes in the middle.

2591
02:17:20,180 --> 02:17:23,720
So many more women are of
average intelligence than men.

2592
02:17:24,170 --> 02:17:26,570
Now you still have your brilliant women,
you still have your done with it.

2593
02:17:26,810 --> 02:17:29,450
But if you look at the bell curve
of male intelligence, much flatter,

2594
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:33,650
which means that we have a
lot more geniuses and lot
more complete idiots, right?

2595
02:17:33,651 --> 02:17:36,590
And what's happened is everybody's
focused on the idiots among men.

2596
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:40,460
And I've completely began to ignore all
the brilliance that men bring to the

2597
02:17:40,461 --> 02:17:43,610
world. All of the amazing, incredible
inventions that men bring to the world,

2598
02:17:43,611 --> 02:17:47,360
and it's just we're focusing on this
low cluster, which is incredibly biased.

2599
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:49,310
It's like saying, okay,
what blacks in America,

2600
02:17:49,311 --> 02:17:52,340
they commit more crimes and we're just
going to focus on that and say that's all

2601
02:17:52,341 --> 02:17:54,230
the black are and that's all
we're going to portray as blacks,

2602
02:17:54,231 --> 02:17:56,360
as criminals and blah, blah,
blah. Would we incredibly racist,

2603
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:59,870
but the sexism of portraying men as
idiots because we happen to have more

2604
02:17:59,871 --> 02:18:03,770
cluster as a gender on that side and
completely ignoring all of the incredible

2605
02:18:03,771 --> 02:18:05,630
stuff that that brilliant
men bring to the world.

2606
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:10,550
It's incredibly sexist and it's really
hard for, for for people to see.

2607
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:13,340
I mean like the idea that
you were talking earlier,

2608
02:18:13,341 --> 02:18:16,490
the idea that a woman can competently
raise children without a man around,

2609
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:19,760
it's just taken for granted.
Now it's absolutely not true.

2610
02:18:19,761 --> 02:18:21,800
Men are essential to the
healthy raising of children,

2611
02:18:21,801 --> 02:18:24,920
but the idea that we would
recognize that as a society,

2612
02:18:24,921 --> 02:18:26,450
it's just we were just the disposable.

2613
02:18:27,090 --> 02:18:32,090
It's also a very unfortunate situation
went in in regards to feminism that uh,

2614
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:36,390
a lot of people are dealing with their
own personal experiences that they've had

2615
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:40,470
with a few asshole men in their lives
in regards to them not being sexually

2616
02:18:40,471 --> 02:18:43,380
attractive or not fitting into
a certain social group or not.

2617
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:47,670
And then they have somehow or another
extrapolated that that all men are pieces

2618
02:18:47,671 --> 02:18:51,900
of shit and rapists or a massive amount
of them need to be curved and laws need

2619
02:18:51,901 --> 02:18:55,440
to be changed. And if you get drunk
with a girl and you have sex with her,

2620
02:18:55,441 --> 02:18:56,730
you were a rapist, right? I mean,

2621
02:18:56,770 --> 02:19:01,680
and a lot of this is based on their
own negative interactions with men.

2622
02:19:01,681 --> 02:19:06,030
And the stereotype of feminism
unfortunately is like,

2623
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:10,560
there's a meme online, this is
feminism. And it's a woman who, uh,

2624
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:13,340
has a, um, a, uh, of, of,

2625
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:17,340
of political holding up a sign saying
I'm a feminist and she's fucking 300

2626
02:19:17,341 --> 02:19:21,440
pounds. And you know, and everyone's like,
yeah, that's feminism. You know, like,

2627
02:19:21,441 --> 02:19:24,090
this is, yeah, you're right. It's a big
fat, ugly girl that no one's a fuck.

2628
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:28,070
That's really unfortunate.
But the, the type of person

2629
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:32,600
that is a large, unattractive
woman is going to deal with and uh,

2630
02:19:32,940 --> 02:19:36,930
in measurably,
it's going to be so much harder for,

2631
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:40,040
for her to find people who
are sexually attracted to her,

2632
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:43,870
for her to find a healthy
relationships for her too. If you,

2633
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:48,470
it's an unfortunate reality in this
world is that if you are not sexually

2634
02:19:48,471 --> 02:19:49,250
attractive,

2635
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:52,580
you are not going to have as easy ride
when it comes to the opposite sex.

2636
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:53,443
It's just a fact.

2637
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:57,060
Well, I mean, but sexually
attractive and 300 pounds, I mean,

2638
02:19:57,061 --> 02:20:00,150
somebody who's 300 pounds is for
most people are going to be sexually

2639
02:20:00,151 --> 02:20:03,780
unattractive, but if they
shouldn't lose weight and exercise,

2640
02:20:03,781 --> 02:20:04,830
that's sort of a different matter.

2641
02:20:04,831 --> 02:20:06,870
And that just comes down to
a basic human competence.

2642
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:08,400
But one of the things
that I've thought of,

2643
02:20:08,401 --> 02:20:12,540
like I grew up with a single mom and we
lived because single moms who used to be

2644
02:20:12,541 --> 02:20:14,400
broke, right? I mean,
because it's a test life.

2645
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:16,320
And so when I grew up with a single mom,

2646
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:18,540
everyone around me has single
moms as well. You know,

2647
02:20:18,541 --> 02:20:23,541
what's interesting is that the kind of
men who float through single mom world,

2648
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:27,570
they're not always the best kind of
men, right? They kind of trashy, right?

2649
02:20:27,571 --> 02:20:31,830
Because like the really
competent and successful and
intelligent men on trawling,

2650
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,320
the girlfriend froms at the single mom,
you know,

2651
02:20:34,321 --> 02:20:36,060
they'll rent housing getups right,
right.

2652
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:40,320
And so I think what happens is a lot of
these women have grown up in single mom

2653
02:20:40,321 --> 02:20:43,190
households or, or in this sort of
environment. And Sue who would,

2654
02:20:43,191 --> 02:20:45,750
the men who floating through that,
they tend to kind of be losers.

2655
02:20:45,751 --> 02:20:49,350
They tend to be pretty unstable. They
tend to be kind of parasitical. They,

2656
02:20:49,351 --> 02:20:53,100
you know, they don't tend to be very, the
very best specimens of, of masculinity.

2657
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:56,430
And so I think the breakdown of the
family has created an environment where a

2658
02:20:56,431 --> 02:20:59,910
lot of girls growing up don't have a
positive male role model in their life.

2659
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:03,060
And the kind of end that they see floating
through their mom's bands tend to be

2660
02:21:03,061 --> 02:21:05,190
kind of trashy. So they're
like, well, this is masculinity.

2661
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:08,220
It's also very unfortunate that
in a criticism of masculinity,

2662
02:21:08,221 --> 02:21:11,100
you've removed a lot of allies.
You know,

2663
02:21:11,101 --> 02:21:13,710
by by blanket generalizations of men,

2664
02:21:13,711 --> 02:21:18,390
you removed a lot of people like myself
who I can't support you on that even

2665
02:21:18,391 --> 02:21:23,280
though I'm the entirely approach
human being and, and pro equality.

2666
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:27,140
But when you make these
mass generalizations and
call someone a men's right

2667
02:21:27,150 --> 02:21:30,900
advocate asshole like that, these,
these are nonsense statements.

2668
02:21:30,901 --> 02:21:33,660
And it's unfortunate that
I guarantee you these,

2669
02:21:33,710 --> 02:21:35,370
and it's not saying that all feminists,

2670
02:21:36,030 --> 02:21:40,420
feminists or unattractive or all
feminists or uh, you know, uh, not, not,

2671
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:44,820
not sexually viable,
but I guarantee you almost all of them,

2672
02:21:44,821 --> 02:21:46,800
I've had a lot of negative
experiences with men.

2673
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:49,140
And it doesn't mean that
all men are negative.

2674
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:54,240
And it doesn't mean that there's not
people out there that you would assume

2675
02:21:54,390 --> 02:21:57,890
would be assholes, are actually very
nice people. But you've got this, uh,

2676
02:21:58,020 --> 02:21:58,860
this idea that's,

2677
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:02,850
it's easier to define the world by these
rigid dimensions that you've sort of

2678
02:22:02,851 --> 02:22:05,900
set up for yourself.
And when I,

2679
02:22:05,930 --> 02:22:10,020
when I read things that are from
this feminist point of view,

2680
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:14,750
there's so often aggressive and it's so
often, and I get that there's a blowback.

2681
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:19,230
I do get that I get
that they've experienced
marginalization and they believe

2682
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:19,650
that,
you know,

2683
02:22:19,650 --> 02:22:24,650
society is set up to support rape culture
and all these strange ideas and that

2684
02:22:24,691 --> 02:22:28,680
there's a back to it. But I don't think
that the way it's being handled is,

2685
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:31,530
I think it's, I don't think
it's objective. I don't,

2686
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:35,870
I don't think it's rational and I
don't think it's balanced. And, uh, I,

2687
02:22:35,871 --> 02:22:39,780
I find it really weird when
really intelligent people
have attached themselves

2688
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:41,640
to these feminist ideas.

2689
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:46,390
Yeah. And, and, but the problem
is, you know, in Canada here,

2690
02:22:46,450 --> 02:22:49,860
I had a guy on my show, a great game,
Bill Gehringer who wrote, um, uh,

2691
02:22:50,090 --> 02:22:51,360
the end of the family and what it was,

2692
02:22:52,030 --> 02:22:55,300
and he pointed out that there's
a revolution that occurs.

2693
02:22:55,301 --> 02:22:57,200
I think that initially is necessary.

2694
02:22:57,370 --> 02:22:59,300
And I think this is also
with Latin America too.

2695
02:22:59,350 --> 02:23:01,750
There's a revolution that occurs
that is initially necessary,

2696
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:07,240
but the whole point of a revolution is
to defund itself to end, right? So yeah,

2697
02:23:07,241 --> 02:23:09,890
I mean there was stuff that needed to be
done. Obviously we've talked about the,

2698
02:23:09,891 --> 02:23:13,360
certainly with blacks in the 60s and some
stuff with women's kind of different,

2699
02:23:13,361 --> 02:23:15,940
right? So cause women, there's always
been this women and children first, right?

2700
02:23:15,941 --> 02:23:18,340
Like the vast majority of the
people who died at the titanic,

2701
02:23:18,341 --> 02:23:21,150
we're men offering up their
lifeboats to women, right?

2702
02:23:21,151 --> 02:23:23,710
Cause there has been a sort of women and
children first and women have been kind

2703
02:23:23,711 --> 02:23:27,240
of elevated. There was no black people
for us in the south right there.

2704
02:23:27,250 --> 02:23:29,320
So it's a little bit different.
But there was,

2705
02:23:29,321 --> 02:23:31,720
I think some push for quality
that needed to happen.

2706
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:35,110
But then what happens is you get a lot
of people who get heavily invested in

2707
02:23:35,111 --> 02:23:38,860
this course and the becomes
their ego, their identity, right?

2708
02:23:38,861 --> 02:23:41,380
Like I fight for black wives,
I fight for women's rights and so on.

2709
02:23:41,890 --> 02:23:46,000
But then what happens is
society will often listen and
respond in a positive way.

2710
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:50,530
And then what happens is that course
begins to diminish and people are like,

2711
02:23:50,531 --> 02:23:51,460
you know,
supporting like,

2712
02:23:51,461 --> 02:23:54,070
I'm not going to support
to the abolitionist cause
because slavery is ended,

2713
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:56,140
like I just not tend to do it
and it's over, right? I mean,

2714
02:23:56,141 --> 02:23:59,720
there may be other problems, but that's
not the problem, right? Like ours,

2715
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:01,950
I don't to support a lot
of, uh, you know, let's,

2716
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:04,600
let's deal with polio victims because
we've got this vaccine and we don't really

2717
02:24:04,601 --> 02:24:05,830
have polio victims anymore.
Right?

2718
02:24:05,831 --> 02:24:08,470
So the whole point of a
revolution is to defund itself,

2719
02:24:08,471 --> 02:24:10,450
to end for people to
move on with their lives.

2720
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:12,550
But what happens is when
you have government,

2721
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:15,670
you get these voting blocks and you get,
like in Canada,

2722
02:24:15,671 --> 02:24:17,140
over the last 10 or 15 years,

2723
02:24:17,410 --> 02:24:20,260
Katie government's given $300
million to feminist groups.

2724
02:24:20,710 --> 02:24:23,500
That's not coming from Canadian women
or Canadian men for that matter.

2725
02:24:23,501 --> 02:24:25,720
Because you know,
a lot of it's kind of been dealt with.

2726
02:24:26,050 --> 02:24:29,770
But these groups continue by by poking
these scabs and by continuing these

2727
02:24:29,771 --> 02:24:33,400
grievances and my finding the Trayvon
Martin situation and blowing it up into a

2728
02:24:33,401 --> 02:24:36,610
race war. And all this kind of stuff.
A lot of the stuff has been dealt with,

2729
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:40,000
but because the government's still given
the money, they still need to work up.

2730
02:24:40,001 --> 02:24:42,820
These kinds of hysteria is there
just to justify their own existence.

2731
02:24:42,821 --> 02:24:45,160
I mean the whole point of
a revolution is to end.

2732
02:24:45,161 --> 02:24:49,300
The whole point of I want to deal with
measles is get a vaccine and end measles,

2733
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:51,730
you know, keep taking the same
amount of money that year after year,

2734
02:24:51,731 --> 02:24:53,020
but if you have a government funding it,

2735
02:24:53,021 --> 02:24:54,700
then you have to manufacture
these grievances,

2736
02:24:54,701 --> 02:24:56,530
which just keeps things
going and getting worse.

2737
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:58,510
The point of revolution as a resolution

2738
02:24:59,050 --> 02:25:01,020
and this resolution
never seems to come play.

2739
02:25:01,090 --> 02:25:06,090
It's never going to take place if your
approach is imbalanced and there's just

2740
02:25:07,211 --> 02:25:12,211
some things that are being some proponents
of feminism or endorsing one of them

2741
02:25:12,761 --> 02:25:16,550
being the ability to withdraw
consent equals rape. The ability to,

2742
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:18,600
you mean after the fact
it's after the fact. Yeah.

2743
02:25:18,601 --> 02:25:23,340
That's sending you consented to be giving
you my coffee and then charging you

2744
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:26,390
with theft when you walk out the room.
Yeah. Take my coffee. Oh, officer,

2745
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:28,930
he stole my coffee because I changed
my mind after the fact when he left.

2746
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:29,221
Well,

2747
02:25:29,221 --> 02:25:33,210
the idea is that a man can lie to a
woman in order to get in bed with her and

2748
02:25:33,211 --> 02:25:35,490
then if she can prove that he did that,
that she,

2749
02:25:35,550 --> 02:25:38,430
that he's a rapist because he
tricked her with his words.

2750
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:41,230
Yeah, because of course we're going to
have a lie. I mean they don't use makeup.

2751
02:25:41,231 --> 02:25:42,610
They don't puff up their tits.

2752
02:25:42,611 --> 02:25:47,210
They don't ever falsify any of their like
a man because he's wealthy and hope to

2753
02:25:47,211 --> 02:25:47,380
get

2754
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:48,470
pregnant with the music.
I mean,

2755
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:51,070
I don't see any feminists that
are the crime that, and that's a,

2756
02:25:51,071 --> 02:25:53,050
that's a horrible front to womanhood.

2757
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:56,350
The think that the only way that you could
make a live in is to lie to a man and

2758
02:25:56,560 --> 02:26:00,070
make him get you pregnant so that you
can get money from him. From then on.

2759
02:26:00,071 --> 02:26:04,000
I mean, feminists, true feminists
should be horrified by that.

2760
02:26:04,410 --> 02:26:08,370
It was all focus on the false rape
accusations, false rape accusations,

2761
02:26:08,371 --> 02:26:12,750
which in some studies are 2030 or
40% of the study in the air force.

2762
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:15,960
But they actually, even women who
have withdrawn their accusations,

2763
02:26:15,961 --> 02:26:19,230
2030 or 40% of rent,
rent accusations in some studies,

2764
02:26:19,231 --> 02:26:22,350
who knows what it is universally
are our false. I mean,

2765
02:26:22,351 --> 02:26:25,230
how horrendous that and women
should be coming down so hard.

2766
02:26:25,231 --> 02:26:28,710
I'm women who make false rape accusations
cause they make it so much harder for

2767
02:26:28,711 --> 02:26:30,030
the women who actually happen,
right?

2768
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:32,250
Because then there's that
problem or a false paternity.

2769
02:26:32,430 --> 02:26:35,580
And the problem with false rape
accusations are very few women face

2770
02:26:35,581 --> 02:26:38,700
repercussions for them.
Now in my book, if you can,

2771
02:26:38,730 --> 02:26:41,670
if you accuse someone of a crime and
you lied, you get the punishment,

2772
02:26:41,671 --> 02:26:44,120
they would have gotten you shit.
How it shaped green.

2773
02:26:45,630 --> 02:26:49,440
This football player who has recently
been released, uh, he got on tape,

2774
02:26:49,441 --> 02:26:54,270
this girl a admitting that she lied
about him being him raping her and her

2775
02:26:54,271 --> 02:26:58,910
family received $1 million
or $850,000 and now they,

2776
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:00,660
you know, they, they have
to pay the money back.

2777
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:02,130
But that's the extent of her punishment.

2778
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:04,830
This guy went to jail for
five fucking years, you know,

2779
02:27:04,831 --> 02:27:09,360
and now he's just trying to read, pursue
report. He'd still be there. Well,

2780
02:27:09,361 --> 02:27:11,220
not only that,
he's just one of many.

2781
02:27:11,221 --> 02:27:13,920
I have three friends that
were falsely accused of rape.

2782
02:27:13,950 --> 02:27:18,000
I also have friends that were raped. I
know that there's, I know rape is real.

2783
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:20,880
You know, I have friends who've
have been roofie and you know,

2784
02:27:20,881 --> 02:27:23,690
got out of danger because someone
recognizes the hadn't been drug. It's,

2785
02:27:23,910 --> 02:27:26,850
it's very common. You
know, rape is a disgusting,

2786
02:27:26,851 --> 02:27:31,240
Horrible Anti Human Crime
and I think rape is,

2787
02:27:31,241 --> 02:27:33,120
should be treated the same
way as murderers. You're,

2788
02:27:33,330 --> 02:27:37,230
you're denying someone
their humanity you're doing,
you're taking away something,

2789
02:27:37,231 --> 02:27:40,490
some part of them,
you're removing a part of the w

2790
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:43,270
who they are as a person that's
kind of permanent. Yeah. Somebody,

2791
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:46,830
you can get a new car, but there's
something about sexual violation,

2792
02:27:46,831 --> 02:27:47,790
but it's kind of a permanent,

2793
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:52,760
it's horrible, but so is lying about
it. That's horrible to lying about.

2794
02:27:52,761 --> 02:27:56,590
A rape is just as hard a lot of it. But
often we get a man, right? Yes, yes.

2795
02:27:56,660 --> 02:28:01,100
And this idea of this idea
of withdrawing consent,

2796
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:01,880
you know,

2797
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:04,760
and that somehow or another you could
do that and turn a guy into a rapist.

2798
02:28:04,761 --> 02:28:07,880
That's, that's like hating thing
that's, uh, you don't, you,

2799
02:28:07,890 --> 02:28:10,220
you know what you're doing
is you're, you're, you're,

2800
02:28:10,221 --> 02:28:12,290
you're hating someone who's manipulative.

2801
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:15,350
You're hating someone
who can con you into bed.

2802
02:28:15,530 --> 02:28:20,530
But that's been what men have been
trying to do since the beginning of time.

2803
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:24,020
Like you're heating of the
game of courting a woman.

2804
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:28,220
And there have been men that wear shoes
that they would never wear and watches

2805
02:28:28,221 --> 02:28:29,840
me would never buy.
And cars,

2806
02:28:29,841 --> 02:28:33,650
they don't give a shit about an apartment
that they decorate just to get the

2807
02:28:33,651 --> 02:28:37,790
woman to believe that they're like
this. It's all alive. My friend Brian,

2808
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:42,650
we saw earlier tonight, last
night for sure. Um, Brian
Callahan, so hilarious guy,

2809
02:28:42,651 --> 02:28:44,810
the first time that came over his
house back when he was single,

2810
02:28:44,990 --> 02:28:49,990
he had Jack Kerouac on the road
sitting on his night table opened up.

2811
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:55,370
And I, you know, I'm a Predator,
so I came over his house. I'm like,

2812
02:28:55,371 --> 02:28:57,140
did she may have written
that? You know, I,

2813
02:28:57,141 --> 02:29:00,200
I find weakness that people very
quickly. So I saw that. I go,

2814
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:02,540
you're not fucking reading that.
I go, you're, you're hoping to.

2815
02:29:02,541 --> 02:29:05,930
Chick comes over and she sees
that and she's like, Oh, you read.

2816
02:29:05,931 --> 02:29:09,390
So polling are amazed that he's
there. He started laughing. He goes,

2817
02:29:09,690 --> 02:29:14,480
true, true. I decorate my house to
pretend I'm smarter than I am. I did that.

2818
02:29:14,481 --> 02:29:17,630
There was a Stephen Hawking book, a
brief history of time or whatever, right?

2819
02:29:17,631 --> 02:29:21,020
And I had that on my desk and this woman,
I loved her to death.

2820
02:29:21,021 --> 02:29:24,080
We went out for a while. This woman came
over and she's like, I call bullshit.

2821
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:29,480
I call bullshit on stuff later. And I'm
like, no, no, no. I've read it. And she,

2822
02:29:29,510 --> 02:29:33,290
what she did is she went over and she
opened it and it creates like an old boat

2823
02:29:34,770 --> 02:29:36,380
and it never made it open before.

2824
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:40,130
And it didn't go into his spine was
completely unvetted. They're like,

2825
02:29:40,131 --> 02:29:41,030
you know what?
You got me.

2826
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:45,760
That's nurses. That's hilarious.
We lie, we pretend, you know,

2827
02:29:45,761 --> 02:29:48,100
I've always,
I have this thing and I say people,

2828
02:29:48,101 --> 02:29:51,340
and I think a lot of times we lie and
pretend it was a big part of us because

2829
02:29:51,341 --> 02:29:54,820
we're not happy with who we are,
where we're not really and we like to be.

2830
02:29:54,930 --> 02:29:58,600
We would like to wish that we were
somewhat better. I always tell people,

2831
02:29:58,780 --> 02:30:01,150
be the person that you pretend to
be when you're trying to get laid,

2832
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:06,490
you are your life optimally.
You want to really be an admirable person.

2833
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:10,660
Be The hero of your own story and be the
guy that you pretend to be when you try

2834
02:30:10,661 --> 02:30:13,840
to get laid and if you can find people
who love you for who you are. I mean,

2835
02:30:13,841 --> 02:30:16,810
my God, isn't that easier? Yeah. The
problem with the pretenses, you know,

2836
02:30:16,811 --> 02:30:19,090
it's fine in the moment, but man,
you've got to keep that shit up.

2837
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:23,290
That's a lot of work and you have to
love yourself to, in order to be loved.

2838
02:30:23,291 --> 02:30:27,520
If you have all sorts of flaws that you
don't fix and you don't like various

2839
02:30:27,521 --> 02:30:30,860
aspects of yourself that you
don't correct what normal person,

2840
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:32,950
they're normal and they're,
they're, they're sensible.

2841
02:30:32,951 --> 02:30:36,670
Mine would want to engage in a
longterm relationship with some of this

2842
02:30:36,910 --> 02:30:40,060
incredibly flawed knows it
and does nothing about it.

2843
02:30:40,270 --> 02:30:41,380
Like that sounds like a nightmare.

2844
02:30:41,381 --> 02:30:44,370
That's how like taking out
a dog that shits all over
the house, you know, you're,

2845
02:30:44,371 --> 02:30:47,890
you, you, you're just taking out a giant
problem. You gotta fix this person.

2846
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:51,340
And some people do do that. They take
on projects, you know what I mean?

2847
02:30:51,341 --> 02:30:53,120
I have a friend who every
fucking girlfriend and dates,

2848
02:30:53,121 --> 02:30:58,090
it's always broken and that he can never
see that your problem is your own life

2849
02:30:58,091 --> 02:31:00,250
is a mess and you don't
want to deal with that.

2850
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:03,880
So you bring people into your life that
are more fucked up and you could fix up

2851
02:31:03,881 --> 02:31:07,850
some of their problems. Advice,
yeah. We constantly give them advice.

2852
02:31:07,851 --> 02:31:09,850
So you're going to fix them,
but fixing yourself, bitch.

2853
02:31:10,030 --> 02:31:12,970
And if you did fix yourself, you
wouldn't want these people in your life.

2854
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:16,120
If I did a 300 pound woman, the fact
that I'm to 80, it looks better.

2855
02:31:16,210 --> 02:31:20,280
So I don't have to diet. I look
smaller right next. Her. Yeah. I mean,

2856
02:31:20,281 --> 02:31:25,281
I think that that is a huge part of w
what's wrong with people in relationships?

2857
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:28,470
What's wrong with a lot of people
in relationships is internal.

2858
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:29,700
It's what's wrong with you?

2859
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:34,200
What are you bringing into a relationship
until you are happy with who you are

2860
02:31:34,201 --> 02:31:37,340
until you're, you're,
you're, uh, just a, a,

2861
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:42,380
a reasonable person who's objective about
your own actions and objective about

2862
02:31:42,661 --> 02:31:45,570
your own path in life and
enjoying your own path in life.

2863
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:48,480
You're not worthy of a healthy,
happy relationship.

2864
02:31:48,481 --> 02:31:51,810
You haven't gotten your own shit
together yet. Wow. This is terrible.

2865
02:31:51,870 --> 02:31:54,690
I think dichotomy where,
you know,

2866
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:58,330
women get married to guys hoping that
they'll change and you guys getting back

2867
02:31:58,331 --> 02:32:01,760
to women hoping that they wound, you're
not going to cut that long hair. I,

2868
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:04,830
you like when you have kids,
right? I mean, you're going
to keep exercising, right?

2869
02:32:04,831 --> 02:32:07,530
You're still going to look right.
Right. And, and all that. And I mean,

2870
02:32:07,531 --> 02:32:10,620
the idea that you're with someone
in the hopes that they'll change,

2871
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:13,290
it's just completely insane.
It's like buying a Buick and helping.

2872
02:32:13,291 --> 02:32:15,270
It's going to be a boat. I mean,
it's not what you bought it.

2873
02:32:15,410 --> 02:32:18,000
Them thinking about
bogus, ridiculous. Well,

2874
02:32:18,001 --> 02:32:20,100
there are a lot of women
who like to do that though.

2875
02:32:20,101 --> 02:32:23,760
They would like to fix fixing change
definitely at him and he's going to be

2876
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:26,950
right. It's a throw things out. Like,
where's that, where's that book?

2877
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:27,970
I shouldn't read that.

2878
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:32,710
Or, or you know, there's still three
Adams holding my underwear together.

2879
02:32:32,711 --> 02:32:34,110
How dare you put them in the garbage.

2880
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:38,050
I have a friend and uh,
his, uh, girlfriend, uh,

2881
02:32:38,250 --> 02:32:42,660
he went to the bathroom and his girlfriend
was confronted by my other friend's

2882
02:32:42,661 --> 02:32:45,690
girlfriend about the kind
of car he drives cars.

2883
02:32:45,691 --> 02:32:49,490
He drove a sports car and he had a
Ferrari. He's a wealthy guy. And the,

2884
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:51,870
the girlfriend was like,
why don't you let him drive that car?

2885
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:55,200
He let him drive that car.
That was her words.

2886
02:32:55,440 --> 02:33:00,220
Like your guy driving a car like that.
It's like, you know, he's like, he's like,

2887
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:01,300
why do you let them have that college?

2888
02:33:01,301 --> 02:33:06,150
She was correcting him because she was
concerned that her boyfriend might get

2889
02:33:06,151 --> 02:33:10,060
ideas. Like I can get a car like
that too because my friend has a dog.

2890
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:11,670
So she wanted to,
what?

2891
02:33:11,671 --> 02:33:14,260
She was worried about her and
she did it in front of her man.

2892
02:33:14,261 --> 02:33:15,180
I like to check him.

2893
02:33:15,470 --> 02:33:20,470
She went to this girl and was correcting
her situation of a fucking car.

2894
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:23,160
I mean it was like decisive.
You've got time.

2895
02:33:23,161 --> 02:33:25,070
Don't you have shit to do with
your life rather than a woman.

2896
02:33:25,100 --> 02:33:29,220
Trouble them manipulate.
And she was incredibly
manipulative. This woman and uh,

2897
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:31,350
you know those,
those people are not in my life anymore.

2898
02:33:31,351 --> 02:33:35,770
But this woman was incredibly manipulative
and she, she would, the guy was like a,

2899
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:38,850
a wealthy, strong guy.
But for whatever reason,

2900
02:33:38,851 --> 02:33:42,090
this attractive woman came in and was
life and just started dominating him.

2901
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:43,073
She didn't work.

2902
02:33:43,140 --> 02:33:48,120
I paid for everything and she
wouldn't let him do shit. She,

2903
02:33:48,130 --> 02:33:51,930
she chose everything that he did.
She dressed him.

2904
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:55,410
She bought clothes for him and he
was not allowed to buy a sports car.

2905
02:33:56,020 --> 02:33:58,560
She not as anything great
about having a sports car.

2906
02:33:58,561 --> 02:34:00,930
But I don't understand if
you're going to be a capitalist,

2907
02:34:00,931 --> 02:34:04,740
you've gotta be a materialist, which
they clearly worry this big giant house.

2908
02:34:04,970 --> 02:34:06,840
She would buy whatever
the fucking car you want.

2909
02:34:06,990 --> 02:34:09,480
If you're really going to bust
your ass and work 12 hours a day.

2910
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:13,680
I'm not saying there's any great honor
or no ability and buying a Ferrari,

2911
02:34:13,860 --> 02:34:17,410
but if you really want a Ferrari and
you've got a lot of money by a fucking

2912
02:34:17,411 --> 02:34:18,790
Ferrari,
who gives a shit

2913
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:22,420
that reminds me best moment into
Peter Joseph interview because I'm,

2914
02:34:22,510 --> 02:34:25,450
we're doing it. I'm doing a debate
with him on Monday. Ah, cause uh,

2915
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:28,900
we have slightly different ideas about
how the future should go and we'd have a

2916
02:34:28,901 --> 02:34:31,270
debate and as I listened to your,
uh, your, your show with it,

2917
02:34:31,271 --> 02:34:36,120
which is really enjoyable and I love
the, where he said, you know, you know,

2918
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:38,590
they, they could make better
cars, you know, like the Ferrari,

2919
02:34:38,591 --> 02:34:40,630
they could make that
better. And you're like, no,

2920
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:43,550
they absolutely could not make that
car any better than it is anyways.

2921
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:45,490
With something like that was like,
I mean,

2922
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:49,140
that's the pinnacle of human engineering
to shut the fuck up. Yeah. Like, I mean,

2923
02:34:49,150 --> 02:34:52,260
unless you're going to have like an
angel's wings and wheels that you cannot

2924
02:34:52,270 --> 02:34:53,200
improve that car.

2925
02:34:53,201 --> 02:34:58,201
That's about as good as you get sort of
silly socialist ideology where you don't

2926
02:34:58,751 --> 02:35:01,510
vet your facts out before
you start blabbing. You know?

2927
02:35:01,511 --> 02:35:03,970
You can't say they can make
them better Porsche. No,

2928
02:35:03,971 --> 02:35:06,850
they fucking race the 24 hours a la Mons,

2929
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:09,580
they competing as the
best cars in the world.

2930
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:12,450
They brilliantly
engineered these vehicles.

2931
02:35:12,460 --> 02:35:17,050
Guys know the uptake from the Porsche is
the fucking teleporter and stuff. Right.

2932
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:19,830
There's no better way to get
around that when people talk. Yeah.

2933
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:23,600
To me like that, like they can make
a better car. No, they cannot stop.

2934
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:25,100
You don't know what you're talking about.

2935
02:35:25,101 --> 02:35:26,720
You don't know the history
of what you're saying.

2936
02:35:27,070 --> 02:35:31,370
What you're doing is saying something
that goes along with your ideology.

2937
02:35:31,371 --> 02:35:33,890
You would like it to be true because
it would make you more brilliant.

2938
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:37,640
Good, make your points. But if I have
to bend facts to meet your theories,

2939
02:35:37,641 --> 02:35:40,460
that exit of brilliant. Right. It have
to be a slave to the facts. Right.

2940
02:35:40,461 --> 02:35:41,060
He's got it.

2941
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:42,350
Great thing going on.

2942
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:46,430
He's got a really interesting thing
going on but it's very culty you know is

2943
02:35:46,580 --> 02:35:50,210
there's a lot of, there's, there's a
lot of cultiness to that and it's also,

2944
02:35:50,211 --> 02:35:54,350
it all falls out the window
when you realize that he's
a stockbroker. He was for,

2945
02:35:55,720 --> 02:35:59,660
he still does still does it. So he makes
his money. Really? Yes. He's a day trader.

2946
02:36:00,530 --> 02:36:00,831
It doesn't,

2947
02:36:00,831 --> 02:36:03,140
you get people to like rip out their
kidneys and emailed them to him or

2948
02:36:03,141 --> 02:36:04,960
something that isn't that what the cedars,

2949
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:09,790
it's unlikely the guy trying to run a
call if he's a very smart guy and I don't

2950
02:36:09,791 --> 02:36:13,280
think he believes he's
sort of a frustrated

2951
02:36:13,290 --> 02:36:17,220
musician and a day trader.
Yeah. Very bright guy and

2952
02:36:17,430 --> 02:36:22,430
Moxley play the stock market and mocks
bank has made and then it kicked her out

2953
02:36:23,911 --> 02:36:26,940
when she had a baby. Cause
you know exploiting the
working classes is really bad.

2954
02:36:27,030 --> 02:36:29,580
Right, exactly. It just kind of
do it as well as the capitalist.

2955
02:36:29,610 --> 02:36:30,443
That's my problem.

2956
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:34,700
There's a lot of those guys out there
that become intoxicated with the attention

2957
02:36:34,710 --> 02:36:38,000
that you get from having good
ideas, you know? And that's a,

2958
02:36:38,001 --> 02:36:40,740
that's a real common
occurrence and human nature.

2959
02:36:41,070 --> 02:36:44,910
Whenever someone gets to talk and people
listen and go, you're amazing. You just,

2960
02:36:44,911 --> 02:36:47,940
you know, oh, I'm amazing. You don't
go, hmm. Does that person just dumb?

2961
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:54,460
Maybe like I need, I need more of you
all, all the smart people out the room.

2962
02:36:54,461 --> 02:36:57,880
I even move you and your second cousins,
especially if you've bred together,

2963
02:36:57,881 --> 02:36:59,820
bring me your children.
They'll just fit right in.

2964
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:03,480
I'm always the first point out that
every single thing that ever comes out an

2965
02:37:03,481 --> 02:37:03,820
office,

2966
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:06,890
essentially just some things that I've
read and you've very humbled about that.

2967
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:09,100
And you opened, he said like, I'm
not smart enough to understand this.

2968
02:37:09,101 --> 02:37:12,250
I don't really get that, but she's in my
thoughts. And that is important. Yeah.

2969
02:37:12,251 --> 02:37:15,890
Cause I mean, nobody has the answers the
best. I mean, I like what Socrates did.

2970
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:17,750
The best you can do is provoke thought.
I mean,

2971
02:37:17,751 --> 02:37:21,770
how many answers have we given the people
in this conversation? Not really. Well,

2972
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:25,190
don't get your kids, you know,
that's one reason with your kids,

2973
02:37:25,191 --> 02:37:28,760
maybe you stay home with them if
you can then he of anyway, but,

2974
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:30,163
but those are sort of,

2975
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:34,610
I mean that's such common sense that the
fortunate or unfortunate put me but big

2976
02:37:34,611 --> 02:37:38,500
answers, you know, man, I think the oldest
really worried about that. You know,

2977
02:37:38,630 --> 02:37:42,020
the moral instructors of mankind and
usually complete control freaks and

2978
02:37:42,130 --> 02:37:42,963
ourselves

2979
02:37:43,110 --> 02:37:45,210
Senate grey,
I think it's almost impossible.

2980
02:37:45,570 --> 02:37:50,570
I think we all together can work things
out by talking and exchanging ideas and

2981
02:37:51,991 --> 02:37:55,800
exchanging opinions and agreeing and
seeing each other's points of view.

2982
02:37:55,980 --> 02:37:58,980
I think we could help that way
we can all help each other.

2983
02:37:59,190 --> 02:38:02,310
But the idea that one person is going
to be the more moral authority or the

2984
02:38:02,311 --> 02:38:04,560
voice of Wisdom,
it's a very dangerous position.

2985
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:06,410
It really is.
I been,

2986
02:38:06,411 --> 02:38:08,780
there's a few things that are
uncomfortable saying people shouldn't do,

2987
02:38:09,220 --> 02:38:10,250
but outside of that,

2988
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:13,880
I have no idea what is going to make
you the happiest in life. I mean, yeah,

2989
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:16,310
don't steal. Don't kill dunk.
Right, fine, fine, fine.

2990
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,610
But even how many people really
do that? Not many. Right?

2991
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:22,340
But actually how people should
live. I mean, man, if it doesn't,

2992
02:38:22,350 --> 02:38:25,410
we can start pointing guns at each other
and we can stop having these crazy laws.

2993
02:38:25,411 --> 02:38:27,740
Stop throwing people in jail for
the wrong bits of vegetation.

2994
02:38:27,741 --> 02:38:29,810
I think that would be a
great step forward. You know,

2995
02:38:29,811 --> 02:38:33,410
let's just stop pointing
guns at each other, gets get
stuff done. Outside of that,

2996
02:38:33,411 --> 02:38:36,440
I have no idea what people should
do to make themselves happy.

2997
02:38:36,441 --> 02:38:40,040
And if that's you're
legitimately intelligence and
half the time I'm not even

2998
02:38:40,041 --> 02:38:41,960
sure myself, right? I mean,
you sit there and say, well,

2999
02:38:41,961 --> 02:38:44,030
what should I do with my day that's
going to make me the happiest?

3000
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,950
It's nice to have to try so whatever.
Right?

3001
02:38:45,951 --> 02:38:48,440
But as to what other people should do,
you know,

3002
02:38:48,441 --> 02:38:51,570
who they should be with and what
careers they should follow. I mean,

3003
02:38:51,571 --> 02:38:55,190
that's really, it's impossible. It's
hard to know. It's a very important,

3004
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:57,650
yeah,
you bring up that.

3005
02:38:57,860 --> 02:39:01,040
Especially because there's so many
things that people like that I don't,

3006
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:04,000
there's so many things that I liked the
people don't like. I've had a really,

3007
02:39:04,070 --> 02:39:05,210
really intelligent friends that go,

3008
02:39:05,211 --> 02:39:09,500
why do you like this mixed martial arts
stuff? I don't know. I just do. I like it.

3009
02:39:09,501 --> 02:39:12,620
Did I know, I understand that
it's, it's a controlled violence.

3010
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:16,700
I understand that it's a,
it's a disturbing for some
people to watch, but to me,

3011
02:39:16,701 --> 02:39:20,220
it's been a part of my life since
I was a boy. And, uh, I, you know,

3012
02:39:20,270 --> 02:39:24,530
I find it incredibly fascinating. Sorry,
you don't, it's okay. You know, you know,

3013
02:39:24,531 --> 02:39:25,364
and by the way,

3014
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:28,010
the people that I've met that are
mixed martial artists are fighters,

3015
02:39:28,011 --> 02:39:30,680
are some of the nicest people
I've ever met in my life.

3016
02:39:31,070 --> 02:39:34,160
And one of the reasons is that they've
conquered their ego to a certain extent,

3017
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:37,910
and that they have a much better control
over it because they're being checked

3018
02:39:37,911 --> 02:39:40,520
over and over again on a
daily basis in the gym.

3019
02:39:40,770 --> 02:39:43,590
Oh, discipline is highly
underrated. Virtue.

3020
02:39:43,591 --> 02:39:46,930
I think it used to be more
highly rated discipline. I mean,

3021
02:39:46,950 --> 02:39:49,380
the discipline to say when you're
wrong, you're wrong. I mean,

3022
02:39:49,381 --> 02:39:51,600
that's what bothers me
so much about people.

3023
02:39:51,601 --> 02:39:55,900
It's this lazy edges of their permission
slips. You know? Like I was like,

3024
02:39:55,901 --> 02:39:59,130
when people do like really stupid
shit out of me, it's just like how,

3025
02:39:59,131 --> 02:40:03,000
how has that, how do you give yourself
permission to do that? Like how has that,

3026
02:40:03,210 --> 02:40:06,570
how was that on your list of possible
things to do and still be happy about

3027
02:40:06,571 --> 02:40:09,870
yourself or, or even like how has
that, you know, you know, I hit my kid.

3028
02:40:09,990 --> 02:40:13,830
How is that? Like how was that
even on your list possibilities?

3029
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:16,440
How do you have, like, why
would you just say, no,

3030
02:40:16,441 --> 02:40:19,260
I'm not going to do that and
have the discipline to not do it.

3031
02:40:19,261 --> 02:40:20,420
That seems to be pretty obvious.

3032
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:24,430
It's very underrated aspect of being a
man of being a human is having a code

3033
02:40:24,431 --> 02:40:24,900
that you live with.

3034
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:26,580
Yeah, some self discipline. Like,

3035
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:29,400
I mean the guys would get up at 5:00
AM workout and stuff like that. Like,

3036
02:40:29,560 --> 02:40:31,650
you know, the other day I was like,
yeah I can be like most people are like,

3037
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:34,020
oh I'm kind of tired trying
to work out or having that,

3038
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:35,880
you know and you know part of you's like,

3039
02:40:35,930 --> 02:40:39,520
oh what an app would be nice
right now because she's like,

3040
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:44,430
yeah go do a word better feel better and
just sleep better that night cause you

3041
02:40:44,431 --> 02:40:47,610
didn't have an happen scrub your cycle.
So just that kind of discipline is,

3042
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:48,780
is really lacking.

3043
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:51,600
I think we used to have a lot more of
it when we were really confronted with

3044
02:40:51,601 --> 02:40:52,440
nature a lot more.

3045
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:55,890
And how will you live in this fuzzy city
where you can get everything 24 seven

3046
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:58,140
it's all easy to come by and so on.
And we've got kind of,

3047
02:40:58,330 --> 02:41:00,710
and the material listen to me comes
with the laziness and the lease.

3048
02:41:00,710 --> 02:41:03,480
And this comes with the depth because
we talk about national debts and so on.

3049
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:04,361
I mean in,

3050
02:41:04,361 --> 02:41:08,640
in America and to some degree is almost
as bad in Canada to people like have

3051
02:41:08,641 --> 02:41:12,570
debts and way bigger than their income.
And that's a kind of laziness too. Like,

3052
02:41:12,571 --> 02:41:15,360
what's with the different, like why not
the first and gratification, you know,

3053
02:41:15,370 --> 02:41:18,120
they're gonna study on kids.
It's called the marshmallow study.

3054
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:20,940
They take four year olds and
they sit them down and they say,

3055
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:24,220
you can have two marshmallows now.
Sorry, you can have one. You can't, you,

3056
02:41:24,221 --> 02:41:28,650
you can have two marshmallows now or you
can have for marshmallows if you have

3057
02:41:28,651 --> 02:41:32,400
to. If you have one now and wait,
they're always take two now. Well No,

3058
02:41:32,450 --> 02:41:35,640
there's some of them that that will
differ real and there's some of them that

3059
02:41:35,641 --> 02:41:40,140
won't and they track these kids through
life and they find that consistently

3060
02:41:40,141 --> 02:41:43,380
those were able to defer gratification.
Just do a hell of a lot better.

3061
02:41:43,381 --> 02:41:46,080
I bet you there were times when you got
up to do fear factor and you're like,

3062
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:49,480
if there's one thing I don't want
to do today, it's fear factor,

3063
02:41:51,990 --> 02:41:55,990
but I mean the discipline to just
get up and you know what I mean?

3064
02:41:56,690 --> 02:41:59,610
What Woody Allen says, you know,
90% of success is just showing up.

3065
02:41:59,611 --> 02:42:02,460
That's kind of the discipline to do
it when you don't feel like doing it.

3066
02:42:02,461 --> 02:42:03,720
Then deferral of gratification.

3067
02:42:03,721 --> 02:42:06,030
I'm sure with the training there's
times with the address kicked butt,

3068
02:42:06,031 --> 02:42:08,490
you'd pull the muscle and just like,
well, I'm going to go back and do it.

3069
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:10,530
Or there's times where like that
she's getting looks like I'm,

3070
02:42:10,570 --> 02:42:13,770
well I'm drooling like a tsunami here,
but you just don't do it.

3071
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:15,950
And I think that kind of discipline.
Um,

3072
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:19,050
so you said that the fibers
are like really great guys.

3073
02:42:19,051 --> 02:42:23,010
I think it's because they
probably would've worked
that muscle of discipline to

3074
02:42:23,011 --> 02:42:24,090
the point where they have a code,

3075
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:27,630
they have a set of personal
responsibilities and they
don't let themselves step

3076
02:42:27,631 --> 02:42:28,351
outside of that.

3077
02:42:28,351 --> 02:42:31,260
And so there's a kind of security and
people who have a lot of discipline in

3078
02:42:31,261 --> 02:42:33,290
whatever field it is that
they're working in. A,

3079
02:42:33,410 --> 02:42:36,090
I really like being around people who
have got a lot of discipline because you

3080
02:42:36,091 --> 02:42:38,370
know, they're not just going to
do some random shit. It's awesome

3081
02:42:38,530 --> 02:42:41,660
firing to me. Yeah. I like being
around people that work hard. It's,

3082
02:42:41,740 --> 02:42:45,930
it makes me feel like I should get things
done to accomplish things and people

3083
02:42:45,950 --> 02:42:47,890
accomplish things around you
and they're, they're, they've,

3084
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:51,970
they've experienced joy and success and,
and they experience this feeling of,

3085
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:57,290
wow, I did it. I pulled it
off. That's inspiring. It
makes you want to do the same.

3086
02:42:57,330 --> 02:43:01,060
It makes you want to and the more things
I accomplished and the more things I do,

3087
02:43:01,061 --> 02:43:04,350
well the happier I am as a person
I find as a direct correlation.

3088
02:43:04,630 --> 02:43:08,140
Do you have a, a plan that, I know you
said you was, it's a little bit, you know,

3089
02:43:08,141 --> 02:43:12,040
grab what you can and as far as your
career goes in a little on the lesson plan

3090
02:43:12,041 --> 02:43:15,970
side, but do you have a sort of an
idea of what you want to go five years,

3091
02:43:15,971 --> 02:43:20,230
you know, 10 years kind
of thing? Um, no, no,

3092
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:23,150
I uh, I'm here, this sort of,

3093
02:43:23,880 --> 02:43:27,570
yeah, while I'm here, you know what I'm
doing right now. I love, I really a,

3094
02:43:27,571 --> 02:43:31,440
I like to keep doing it and my plan
is to continue to do it. But if I,

3095
02:43:31,441 --> 02:43:34,320
if everything maintained
exactly where it is right now,

3096
02:43:34,321 --> 02:43:36,120
I don't think I would
do anything differently.

3097
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:38,330
I think it would continue
to work on my standup.

3098
02:43:38,340 --> 02:43:41,460
I continued to do a
commentary for the fights.

3099
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:45,660
I've continued to do podcasting
and I enjoy all those very much.

3100
02:43:45,810 --> 02:43:50,610
I continue to try to be the best father
I can continue to try to be the best

3101
02:43:50,611 --> 02:43:55,560
husband I can, all that good
stuff. But other than that,
no, I don't have any plans,

3102
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:58,650
my plans or just enjoy life.
And I enjoyed life very much.

3103
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:02,460
My plans were to maintain that
enthusiasm and that happiness,

3104
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:04,640
the joy of life.
Uh,

3105
02:44:04,740 --> 02:44:09,150
and it spread as much of that as I
can inspire people if I can. And, uh,

3106
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:11,400
and it just inspired
people by enjoying myself.

3107
02:44:11,401 --> 02:44:14,840
How's other people have inspired
me by enjoying their lives. Um,

3108
02:44:14,841 --> 02:44:17,670
I'm inspired constantly by
people love their craft,

3109
02:44:17,970 --> 02:44:19,500
like people who love their profession,

3110
02:44:19,501 --> 02:44:23,490
but people love what they do is so it's
very infectious, you know? So that's,

3111
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:24,960
that's the only girls in our house.

3112
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:26,290
And that's,
I mean,

3113
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:29,620
that's sort of the definition of a happy
life that if it continues the way it is,

3114
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:30,860
that's pretty damn good.
Yeah.

3115
02:44:31,150 --> 02:44:35,580
Yeah. And you know, and maybe grows
and maybe, uh, maybe gets some,

3116
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:38,200
I would like to get better and
everything that I'm doing that I enjoy,

3117
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:42,040
but you have to, I, in Jujitsu, you
don't maintain to get better. And comedy,

3118
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:43,300
you don't maintain,
you get better.

3119
02:44:43,540 --> 02:44:46,000
If you continue to focus on it
and you learn from your, your,

3120
02:44:46,010 --> 02:44:48,550
your past experiences,
you're going to improve.

3121
02:44:48,610 --> 02:44:51,220
If you apply intelligence
and focus to anything,

3122
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:52,480
you're going to get better at it.
There's,

3123
02:44:52,500 --> 02:44:56,080
it's not like you can become a master
at comedy, even if you are a master,

3124
02:44:56,110 --> 02:45:00,010
you know, you call yourself a black belt.
In comedy, there's, there's, there's room,

3125
02:45:00,040 --> 02:45:04,360
there's always room. This room in
Jujitsu, there's room and martial arts,

3126
02:45:04,361 --> 02:45:05,410
there's room and everything.

3127
02:45:06,210 --> 02:45:09,600
I left the disciplines with no limits.
But you can't ever say this is the end.

3128
02:45:10,950 --> 02:45:15,140
It's never ends. There's no, there's
no like, you're never a total master.

3129
02:45:15,470 --> 02:45:18,390
It's not possible. I mean,
you, you can teach and you,

3130
02:45:18,391 --> 02:45:19,910
you will have a certain amount of math.

3131
02:45:19,970 --> 02:45:23,750
Like there's certain moves that I
cannot teach someone in Jujitsu,

3132
02:45:24,050 --> 02:45:27,480
but could I teach you Jujitsu mastery?
Yeah.

3133
02:45:28,370 --> 02:45:31,510
Something you have to like sort of
pursue on your own and most likely you'll

3134
02:45:31,530 --> 02:45:33,830
never achieve.
You might have a master,

3135
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:37,460
you might be masterful over
one particular skill level,

3136
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:42,410
but then someone else come along that is
much more skillful than you and master

3137
02:45:42,411 --> 02:45:43,990
you. You know, it's, it's,

3138
02:45:44,010 --> 02:45:48,320
it's a constant series of
levels and it's fairly infinite.

3139
02:45:48,530 --> 02:45:51,920
And then there's also, you know, the
physical challenges and, uh, you know,

3140
02:45:51,921 --> 02:45:55,400
athletic ability and all
sorts of intangibles that
different people bring to the

3141
02:45:55,401 --> 02:45:59,210
equation. But I think that
in pursuit of those things,

3142
02:45:59,211 --> 02:46:02,420
it's where you find yourself and
that they're, they're really, uh,

3143
02:46:02,450 --> 02:46:04,250
the interesting aspects of it is the,

3144
02:46:04,460 --> 02:46:06,920
the growth that you
achieve in those things,

3145
02:46:06,921 --> 02:46:10,700
whether it's through the growth in
writing comedy or anything difficult,

3146
02:46:10,701 --> 02:46:12,500
those things manifest itself,

3147
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:15,080
manifest themselves in the
rest of your life as well.

3148
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:17,510
You get better at everything.
Yeah.

3149
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:20,640
I sort of asked you,
is there a dream guest fear

3150
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:24,250
podcasts that we cannot if he was alive,

3151
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:27,750
he had his brother on a fascinating guy.
Um,

3152
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:32,770
the Dreamcast I think I've
already had, you know, I, I
would like more of the same.

3153
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:35,710
You right. Neil degrasse
Tyson was great. Um,

3154
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,380
he's one charismatic guy,
you know,

3155
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:40,810
it's great to have someone in
front and center, rational thinker.

3156
02:46:40,820 --> 02:46:42,570
We're putting it out to the masses,
that beautiful

3157
02:46:42,890 --> 02:46:47,840
Mainer team from tools. Great.
Graham Hancock's, but so
many great guests. I just,

3158
02:46:47,841 --> 02:46:52,290
I just, I enjoy doing it.
I enjoy talking to people,

3159
02:46:52,291 --> 02:46:53,180
but I think it's,

3160
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:57,590
it's broadened my perspective immensely
to be able to have these kinds of

3161
02:46:57,591 --> 02:47:00,320
conversations like you and I sitting
down here for hours just chatting.

3162
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:04,850
I think that's a, it's really difficult
to pull off in the real world, you know?

3163
02:47:04,910 --> 02:47:06,830
Yes.
We're agreeing to have a podcast.

3164
02:47:06,831 --> 02:47:11,060
It's really hard to just set aside three
hours where we're just going to talk.

3165
02:47:11,090 --> 02:47:11,923
It's hard.

3166
02:47:11,930 --> 02:47:13,370
Oh, it's an incredible privilege. I mean,

3167
02:47:13,371 --> 02:47:18,080
I feel incredibly fortunate to have the
opportunity to have conversations like

3168
02:47:18,081 --> 02:47:21,890
this or other people I do.
On my show. I mean, you know,
but it's going to be a dad.

3169
02:47:21,891 --> 02:47:24,860
I got all the parenting experts in
the no university come on my show.

3170
02:47:24,861 --> 02:47:27,980
It was like, Ooh, you know,
so I get to learn it. How do
people get to learn? I mean,

3171
02:47:27,981 --> 02:47:31,550
it's an incredible privilege and this
technology that makes it possible and then

3172
02:47:31,551 --> 02:47:33,020
he's amazing.
It's fantastic.

3173
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:35,640
Yeah. They're like, look how
little we're using here. I mean,

3174
02:47:35,641 --> 02:47:38,240
you have a camera set up and
thank goodness you have them.

3175
02:47:38,380 --> 02:47:41,590
I could record verse 27 minutes.

3176
02:47:41,591 --> 02:47:43,780
We didn't even get this and
that was the gold stuff,

3177
02:47:44,230 --> 02:47:46,850
but this is just a little piece of,
you know,

3178
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:49,750
electronics and it's plugged
into the wall and that's it.

3179
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:52,370
And maybe a million people here.
This molded,

3180
02:47:52,380 --> 02:47:55,630
it goes in the world for ever more harm.
More than a million really?

3181
02:47:55,631 --> 02:47:58,960
Because each one of my downloads is over
half a million. Right. At the minimum.

3182
02:47:59,290 --> 02:48:02,980
1 million. Can we start again then?
Because I was seeing like a little rusty,

3183
02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:09,520
but is that how many times you've been
there, a standup comedy show before? Oh,

3184
02:48:09,521 --> 02:48:10,600
I used to do a lot.
I mean,

3185
02:48:10,601 --> 02:48:12,670
I used to go to a lot when
I was in the business world,

3186
02:48:12,880 --> 02:48:16,510
we'd have clients come up and I'd always
want to take it to a comedy club cause

3187
02:48:16,511 --> 02:48:19,600
it sure beats a movie. Right? And
so I used to go see a lot of comedy.

3188
02:48:19,850 --> 02:48:23,660
I did a little bit, you know, just some
amateur shit when I was uh oh you did?

3189
02:48:24,130 --> 02:48:28,810
Yeah. So and uh, yeah, just open like
stuffing, it wasn't really my thing,

3190
02:48:28,811 --> 02:48:30,420
but uh,
it was fun to go up and try.

3191
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:34,060
I was like doing that sort of stand on
the cliff edge thing. Uh, but I, uh,

3192
02:48:34,090 --> 02:48:38,050
I love stand up. I think, I think
what you guys do is like fantastic.

3193
02:48:38,051 --> 02:48:42,420
I think it's just a real ray of sunshine
in human like, and what you give is, is,

3194
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:46,250
is you give permission for people
to be, to be funny themselves, to,

3195
02:48:46,251 --> 02:48:48,580
to have fun and the
joy that you guys have.

3196
02:48:48,581 --> 02:48:51,460
The one the things I love most about
stand up and you know the breaking bit,

3197
02:48:51,490 --> 02:48:54,790
and you did it a couple of times last
night where you did something that's so

3198
02:48:54,791 --> 02:48:58,030
funny that you yourself found it funny
because maybe it was unrehearsed or

3199
02:48:58,031 --> 02:48:58,861
something spontaneous,

3200
02:48:58,861 --> 02:49:02,410
or you had a thought because that's
seeing somebody who have joined the moment

3201
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:07,680
is really, really enjoyable. If it's real,

3202
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:08,760
that's not really all I know.

3203
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:13,560
There's some people that do like fake
breaks or they'll laugh at their jokes a

3204
02:49:13,561 --> 02:49:16,740
fucking billion times in a row and every
time you see them they'll laughing at

3205
02:49:16,741 --> 02:49:18,030
the same way.
It's kind of gross.

3206
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:20,280
But last night I was working
on a bunch of new stuff,

3207
02:49:20,430 --> 02:49:22,980
so that was one of the reasons why I
thought it was so funny. Yeah, and I mean,

3208
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:26,790
you know, going back and
forth, but the crowd, I mean
it's, it's really amazing to,

3209
02:49:26,791 --> 02:49:29,880
to see the,
the energy that you have a,

3210
02:49:29,881 --> 02:49:33,480
I think people don't see the kind of
energy that really energized standup

3211
02:49:33,481 --> 02:49:35,920
comedian path. They may see
it at a rock show, you know,

3212
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:38,550
but this is the lead singer. Some
Freddie Mercury stuff or whatever. Right?

3213
02:49:38,551 --> 02:49:40,280
But when you go to see standup,

3214
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:43,080
you see somebody who's really
putting out a lot of energy.

3215
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:46,410
And I think it reminds people
that they can be incandescence.

3216
02:49:46,411 --> 02:49:48,390
They don't have to be
like these Dell embers,

3217
02:49:48,391 --> 02:49:51,260
which most people trudge through their
days and their cubicles and whatever.

3218
02:49:51,261 --> 02:49:55,350
I just dragging themselves around. But
I think seeing people really energized,

3219
02:49:55,710 --> 02:49:58,590
it reminds you that it is inspiring.
It reminds you that did,

3220
02:49:58,591 --> 02:50:02,730
you can be energetic, that you can be
powerful, that you can be commanding,

3221
02:50:02,731 --> 02:50:06,900
that you can be generous. Cause stand up
comedy is very generous in my opinion.

3222
02:50:06,901 --> 02:50:08,250
Cause so vulnerable.
I mean,

3223
02:50:08,251 --> 02:50:10,980
you're out there like I made to get
to get a laugh or not, you know,

3224
02:50:10,981 --> 02:50:13,620
like I did the acting and I
didn't do much accommodated some,

3225
02:50:13,621 --> 02:50:16,740
but I mostly did like the serious stuff.
And if the theater is quiet,

3226
02:50:16,770 --> 02:50:19,170
you can just pretend that they're
really moved and you know,

3227
02:50:19,171 --> 02:50:21,660
crying and all that sort of stuff.
But if you're going for laughter,

3228
02:50:21,661 --> 02:50:24,090
I mean it's the hair, it's not,
it's hanging out there. Right.

3229
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:26,760
And so I think I'm not gonna want to
tell you your job because of course,

3230
02:50:26,761 --> 02:50:28,140
you know what,
a million times better than I do.

3231
02:50:28,141 --> 02:50:31,140
But what I really love about the stand
up is just that openness, the honesty,

3232
02:50:31,141 --> 02:50:33,000
the vulnerability,
and the energy.

3233
02:50:33,180 --> 02:50:35,520
It's funny that you should call it
generous to a lot of people think of it as

3234
02:50:35,521 --> 02:50:37,270
selfish because what you're trying to,
you,

3235
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:39,720
you're the only reason why you're being
vulnerable because you're hoping that

3236
02:50:39,721 --> 02:50:41,690
you're gonna get a laugh.
You know your you're yet,

3237
02:50:41,691 --> 02:50:45,300
but you kind of and make them alive. The
life has to come honest, right? I mean,

3238
02:50:45,330 --> 02:50:48,100
if you bomb, nobody laughs out of
generosity. Right? That's true.

3239
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:51,500
And there's ha yeah, or like, and then,

3240
02:50:51,501 --> 02:50:54,720
then the [inaudible] has come out of
the woodwork and then you're fighting a

3241
02:50:54,721 --> 02:50:56,580
losing battle and all that.
Now I do.

3242
02:50:56,581 --> 02:50:59,610
I feel anybody who provides services of
vulnerability and when you're out there

3243
02:50:59,611 --> 02:51:02,190
selling your CD's on the street,
poets is a vulnerability.

3244
02:51:02,580 --> 02:51:06,220
And so I view it as a very generous
thing to stand up, come clean is still,

3245
02:51:06,221 --> 02:51:08,010
of course you get paid and
you know [inaudible] nobody.

3246
02:51:08,020 --> 02:51:10,350
It's not like self sacrifice.
You enjoy what you do,

3247
02:51:10,770 --> 02:51:15,570
but the audience has to know that you
really care about them having a good time

3248
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:16,470
in order for it to work.

3249
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:20,380
I stay around after the show and take
pictures with everybody have to do that

3250
02:51:20,490 --> 02:51:25,490
and you get a helicopter to your layer
and a right Smith could take the Atlanta

3251
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:30,900
tunnels or whatever you do. That to me
is a part of the the the generosity idea.

3252
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:34,560
Yeah. I think it's important
that reinforces the
relationship that aren't even

3253
02:51:34,561 --> 02:51:36,450
appreciate them very much and the,
you know,

3254
02:51:36,451 --> 02:51:39,390
I'd be happy to take pictures with them
and if it takes an hour and a half out

3255
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:42,390
of my day after the show's
over and that's great. Fine.

3256
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:46,760
So far for real work there at that point,

3257
02:51:47,270 --> 02:51:51,480
what I need to lie down and get me some
cold competence and show 'em I actually

3258
02:51:51,870 --> 02:51:55,820
put in work that's a, what is the
prep if you don't get the curtain?

3259
02:51:56,270 --> 02:51:59,600
Well right now I'm working
on a lot of new material.

3260
02:51:59,640 --> 02:52:03,750
So right now there's a lot of writing
involved during the day. The day of show,

3261
02:52:03,751 --> 02:52:06,400
I like to sit down in front of my
computer at least three or four hours

3262
02:52:06,730 --> 02:52:11,260
and write because it really like fires
up all my synopsis and Co Coalesces All

3263
02:52:11,261 --> 02:52:12,190
these ideas together.

3264
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:16,270
And then before the show I write things
down physically in longhand form.

3265
02:52:16,750 --> 02:52:18,220
But like, um, the day of the show,

3266
02:52:18,221 --> 02:52:21,000
like all this stuff that I wrote
about the Toronto Mayor of all that,

3267
02:52:21,001 --> 02:52:24,520
that was all I wrote that the day
that was all new material that I wrote

3268
02:52:24,521 --> 02:52:28,960
specifically because of this
silly guy. It's crazy. Yeah,

3269
02:52:29,130 --> 02:52:32,260
it's amazing. It's about to good stuff.
I'd forgotten about him cause you know,

3270
02:52:32,261 --> 02:52:35,240
I kind of blank out on politics as
much as possible cause I know it's like

3271
02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:40,140
dandelion fluff in the winter. It'll sting
your eyes, but that's my prep. Um, I,

3272
02:52:40,450 --> 02:52:42,700
I feel like I can definitely
do shows without that.

3273
02:52:42,730 --> 02:52:45,880
I mean I can just go and do a show, would
not, you know, I have enough material,

3274
02:52:45,881 --> 02:52:48,190
I could just go and do a show
right now. Like, you know,

3275
02:52:48,191 --> 02:52:51,820
open that door and there's comedy club
and they get on stage and it'll work out.

3276
02:52:51,821 --> 02:52:55,420
But to do it best, I have
to prepare, I have to write,

3277
02:52:55,570 --> 02:52:57,220
especially when the materials new,

3278
02:52:57,550 --> 02:53:00,550
there's like a lot of stuff that I have
to make sure that certain tag lines

3279
02:53:00,551 --> 02:53:01,384
after remember.

3280
02:53:01,390 --> 02:53:05,630
And it's like there's so much memory
involved in somebody past that half to,

3281
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:09,400
and then there's also experiments. I
have to figure out what's the right path.

3282
02:53:09,401 --> 02:53:14,080
Like sometimes I'll, I'll open up with
this and then I'll close with that. Like,

3283
02:53:14,081 --> 02:53:17,530
you know, like last night I close
with all this stuff on being a Vegan.

3284
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:19,750
That's,
I wouldn't give to the last line away.

3285
02:53:19,751 --> 02:53:21,970
But that last line was
like a brand in my head.

3286
02:53:22,030 --> 02:53:25,800
I like thought about that all the way.
Oh yeah. Go see the shallow if yeah.

3287
02:53:25,810 --> 02:53:28,140
Listening to this.
But that last line was like,

3288
02:53:28,150 --> 02:53:29,260
that was the perfect choice for me.

3289
02:53:29,410 --> 02:53:33,190
Oh, thank you. Well, that's how you want
to end it. Boom. Thanks. Tonight. Yeah.

3290
02:53:33,670 --> 02:53:38,330
Leave them wanting more. Yeah. Um,
I wanted to ask you, because I,

3291
02:53:39,330 --> 02:53:41,520
I, this is something that I ask of, uh,

3292
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:45,850
pretty much anybody who I think is a
thinker is like looking at this crazy life

3293
02:53:45,851 --> 02:53:49,300
that we live. Do you have,
do you have a positive

3294
02:53:49,990 --> 02:53:50,630
yeah.

3295
02:53:50,630 --> 02:53:54,350
Outlook for the, for
humans, for culture. Do you,

3296
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:56,890
did you think that we're going
to work this out? Do you,

3297
02:53:56,930 --> 02:54:01,850
are you a voice of doom guy or you, uh,
do you think like, you know what, I,

3298
02:54:01,940 --> 02:54:05,360
I think this is actually moving
in the right direction ultimately.

3299
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:07,613
Yeah.

3300
02:54:07,670 --> 02:54:10,550
Yes. Yeah. How long? Like guy,

3301
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:13,760
after so many words and the most important
question they give you one, but, uh,

3302
02:54:13,770 --> 02:54:15,170
I think that

3303
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:17,330
okay,

3304
02:54:17,330 --> 02:54:22,330
the world will go how the most important
and energetic people will make it go.

3305
02:54:23,570 --> 02:54:26,300
Right. So I don't believe
that I'm along for the ride.

3306
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:30,320
I am not a big movement in
history kind of guy. You know,

3307
02:54:30,321 --> 02:54:33,050
like aliens are Marxists starting
to get old bullshit and technical,

3308
02:54:33,051 --> 02:54:35,730
but they all believe that,
that he's big historical movements.

3309
02:54:35,731 --> 02:54:38,480
Then you know that the, the Zeitgeists
and this and that and the other end,

3310
02:54:38,481 --> 02:54:40,430
we're all just kind of along
for the ride. Like, you know,

3311
02:54:40,510 --> 02:54:42,710
eat grits on the back of the hippo.
I don't believe that.

3312
02:54:42,711 --> 02:54:45,920
I believe in the single great willpower,

3313
02:54:46,010 --> 02:54:51,010
individual theory of history that when
people who have ability and intelligence

3314
02:54:52,070 --> 02:54:53,510
and passion and commitment,

3315
02:54:53,750 --> 02:54:56,720
they're the ones who make the world
go in a particular direction, right?

3316
02:54:56,900 --> 02:54:57,820
Founding fathers did,

3317
02:54:57,830 --> 02:55:01,760
did it one way and it went I think at
a pretty positive direction. You know,

3318
02:55:01,790 --> 02:55:05,060
once the slaves and women got caught up
with the all men are equal kind of thing,

3319
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:08,290
it makes it a pretty positive direction.
You look at Rosa PM,

3320
02:55:08,300 --> 02:55:11,030
the reign of terror in the French
revolution abandoned a break.

3321
02:55:11,090 --> 02:55:14,410
They had direction. If
you look at, um, um, the,

3322
02:55:14,411 --> 02:55:17,480
the Soviets and the
Russian revolution in 1917,

3323
02:55:17,770 --> 02:55:22,310
a lending and company [inaudible]
seriously bad direction and killed like 70

3324
02:55:22,310 --> 02:55:25,220
million people in the Soviet Empire,
right? But these are all individuals,

3325
02:55:25,390 --> 02:55:28,400
all individuals with particular
abilities making choices.

3326
02:55:28,670 --> 02:55:33,670
So I don't believe that the world is going
to get better and less people who can

3327
02:55:34,310 --> 02:55:38,360
make it get better. I think in in entropy
as things get worse, right? I mean, the,

3328
02:55:38,361 --> 02:55:42,170
the, the lowest common denominator and
the worst demagogues tend to take over,

3329
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:44,230
but you can really fight against that.

3330
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:47,120
And I'm a single hero of theory
of history. Like you just,

3331
02:55:47,180 --> 02:55:51,200
you take a stand as best you can and you
shine that light as bright as possible.

3332
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:55,040
And then most people will simply go one
way or another based upon the willpower

3333
02:55:55,041 --> 02:55:57,060
of the individuals that
they listened to and,

3334
02:55:57,070 --> 02:56:00,730
and the clarity and the focus and
humility of the people that listened to

3335
02:56:00,750 --> 02:56:04,430
yourself. Um, I think that it
goes the way we want it to go,

3336
02:56:04,431 --> 02:56:07,430
but it's not going to go there unless
we make it go to a better place.

3337
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:11,120
I think you're right. I think that's a
brilliant way of putting it too. I think,

3338
02:56:11,121 --> 02:56:11,930
um,

3339
02:56:11,930 --> 02:56:16,930
we do get energized from others and the
people that do have power and influence

3340
02:56:17,271 --> 02:56:21,980
do have almost an obligation to energize
people ideas. Yeah. Look, if, if,

3341
02:56:22,250 --> 02:56:24,930
if you know how to do the Heimlich
and someone's choking on a fish bone,

3342
02:56:25,460 --> 02:56:28,730
go help that person. You know, if you
could swim and someone's drowning,

3343
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:29,660
go help that person.

3344
02:56:29,661 --> 02:56:32,660
You have ideas to make the world better
that you think we don't do express them.

3345
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:36,140
Yeah, I mean there's, I
mean I don't believe in hand
chosen positive obligations.

3346
02:56:36,141 --> 02:56:38,360
Like if you choose a contract and
you're bound by that contract,

3347
02:56:38,361 --> 02:56:41,930
I don't think you have to put your
kind of a Dick if you don't, you know,

3348
02:56:41,931 --> 02:56:42,620
like if you're like,

3349
02:56:42,620 --> 02:56:45,740
oh I don't wanna give that
guy a tracheotomy because
this Ravioli is really good.

3350
02:56:45,770 --> 02:56:47,480
Even though you could
say if the guy's life,

3351
02:56:47,481 --> 02:56:50,870
it's not like you should be thrown in
jail for that. But it's really Douchey,

3352
02:56:50,930 --> 02:56:51,171
you know?

3353
02:56:51,171 --> 02:56:55,220
And I think if you have verbal abilities
and you have skills and you have energy

3354
02:56:55,221 --> 02:57:00,200
and your education and you have some
capacity and given how easy it is to,

3355
02:57:00,201 --> 02:57:05,180
to broadcast to the world by God,
you kind of owe it to the future.

3356
02:57:05,270 --> 02:57:05,451
You know?

3357
02:57:05,451 --> 02:57:09,590
Cause all the great stuff that we have
was people putting themselves on the line

3358
02:57:09,620 --> 02:57:12,740
in the past. You know, all the grain,
like the freedoms that we have, the,

3359
02:57:12,741 --> 02:57:13,630
the political freedoms,

3360
02:57:13,670 --> 02:57:16,640
all people fighting hard and a hell
of a lot harder than we have to fight.

3361
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:18,070
You know,
the guys are there,

3362
02:57:18,071 --> 02:57:20,660
the founding fathers they face down
in the British Army for God sakes.

3363
02:57:20,661 --> 02:57:22,190
They could've gotten muskets
through the head, right?

3364
02:57:22,191 --> 02:57:23,580
And Musket ball through the head.
Why do we go,

3365
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:25,820
oh maybe some people might say
bad things about me online.

3366
02:57:25,821 --> 02:57:29,900
It's not exactly Joan of arc stuff,
right? So we have an incredible platform.

3367
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:32,050
We have so little downside to,

3368
02:57:32,130 --> 02:57:36,230
to bringing light to the world that
that's what drives me every day is just I

3369
02:57:36,231 --> 02:57:38,690
want, and especially again, when
you're coming down, you really your,

3370
02:57:38,691 --> 02:57:41,400
your whole timeframe extent, it's
not about your life. It's about,

3371
02:57:41,401 --> 02:57:44,090
and now my daughter's going to outlive
me, but like 40 years, I hope, right?

3372
02:57:44,210 --> 02:57:47,450
50 years.
And it really is about,

3373
02:57:48,680 --> 02:57:51,650
I just can't let the assholes take
over cause assholes love to do,

3374
02:57:51,890 --> 02:57:53,240
to be in charge.
Right.

3375
02:57:53,241 --> 02:57:56,720
And the problem is good people to add
that bossy because good people like live

3376
02:57:56,721 --> 02:57:59,720
and let live. And you know, I didn't want
to be in your face and in your business.

3377
02:57:59,721 --> 02:58:01,890
And you know what? I can to separate
ourselves, love to be in charge.

3378
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:04,830
And they keep congregating
at the top of power.

3379
02:58:05,250 --> 02:58:08,970
And I don't want to be at the top of
power. I don't want to be a politician.

3380
02:58:08,971 --> 02:58:10,430
I don't want to have power over others.

3381
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:12,360
I think that's the ring
has to go in the fire.

3382
02:58:12,370 --> 02:58:14,040
There's no way that they use in our,

3383
02:58:14,640 --> 02:58:19,500
and so the problem is that bad people
are just anal and motivated and Douchey

3384
02:58:19,501 --> 02:58:24,180
and power hungry and they just work
like assholes to get power over others.

3385
02:58:24,210 --> 02:58:25,210
And good people are like,
wow,

3386
02:58:25,211 --> 02:58:27,660
I don't even want that power cause I'm
happy and I'm in love. And you know,

3387
02:58:27,661 --> 02:58:30,150
I've got a great life and so I really
don't want to boss everyone else around.

3388
02:58:30,690 --> 02:58:32,040
But we have through this technology,

3389
02:58:32,041 --> 02:58:34,170
we don't have to have political
power to have an effect.

3390
02:58:34,350 --> 02:58:38,040
And we don't have to be a professor and
teach maybe 5,000 people. They're not,

3391
02:58:38,041 --> 02:58:40,590
we'll Korea or write some book
that maybe 10,000 people read.

3392
02:58:41,010 --> 02:58:44,610
1 million people can listen to this
from what you and I spending a couple of

3393
02:58:44,610 --> 02:58:48,110
hours having a great fucking conversation.
I mean, Ooh, what matters that we,

3394
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:51,000
you know, and we can do that now. First
Time in history. It's interesting.

3395
02:58:51,010 --> 02:58:52,270
There's no burning at the stake there.

3396
02:58:52,500 --> 02:58:55,770
We're not getting burned alive as witches
were not being thrown into, you know,

3397
02:58:55,771 --> 02:58:59,910
Russian lines like soldier Nixon.
I mean we have this, it's when,

3398
02:58:59,911 --> 02:59:01,290
when we have a great conversation,

3399
02:59:01,291 --> 02:59:04,950
the world hopefully gets the nuggets of
wisdom and we turned the ship a little

3400
02:59:04,951 --> 02:59:08,480
bit more towards the light. I agree. I
think there's a great way to end this.

3401
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:12,810
Alright, thank you so much. [inaudible]
your website for my listeners,

3402
02:59:12,930 --> 02:59:16,490
Joe rogan.net Joe Rogan Demos,
freedom Maine radio.com. Um,

3403
02:59:16,740 --> 02:59:18,540
all books are free or podcasts are free.

3404
02:59:18,541 --> 02:59:21,990
Now advertising because I
have the business sense of
a boxer g string and your

3405
02:59:21,991 --> 02:59:25,950
youtube channel. Oh yes. youtube.com
forward slash freedom and reading. Well,

3406
02:59:25,951 --> 02:59:26,784
you know,
I don't,

3407
02:59:27,030 --> 02:59:30,120
I think you have a great business sense
because you've accumulated this massive

3408
02:59:30,121 --> 02:59:34,170
fallen sort of few, few wanted to
sell something. Now it'd be the time.

3409
02:59:34,810 --> 02:59:38,760
How to think about it builds up the
awesome core audience. So that's right.

3410
02:59:38,761 --> 02:59:40,060
And I've held off from Sally something.

3411
02:59:40,061 --> 02:59:43,620
So the first thing I sell is going to
be great baby. Just some gold actually.

3412
02:59:43,621 --> 02:59:47,160
Well, I am. I mean, it's not for sale, but
a documentary is coming out pretty soon.

3413
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:51,600
I've had good fortunate to work with Sean
Lennon and some other great musicians

3414
02:59:51,830 --> 02:59:55,380
too. What's the documentary? It's
called truth because I'm very modest.

3415
02:59:56,010 --> 02:59:57,180
It's basically a,

3416
02:59:57,181 --> 03:00:00,030
it's a documentary about what's wrong
with the world and how we should fix it

3417
03:00:00,460 --> 03:00:02,280
for, on philosophic. Cause
let me know when it comes out.

3418
03:00:02,281 --> 03:00:05,490
I would have you promoted. Thank you
very much Joe time. Thank you very much.

3419
03:00:05,491 --> 03:00:06,324
There's a lot of fun.

3420
03:00:15,800 --> 03:00:20,800
[inaudible].
