1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,530
Hey Joe Rogan podcast by night,
all day he was sitting there was still

2
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:09,780
that kind of prestigious like app after
he lost that and it's like,

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,510
oh fuck it.
Yeah,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,343
we can.
Coach

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,590
coaches were saying that his,
his own mma coach,

6
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:20,430
after he knocked out,
Brett Rogers said that fate or one with

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:23,370
his old tricks,
but he would have liked to have him for

8
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,040
more time training and he thinks he's
not,

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,280
he's not approaching it correctly and he
just won by being fader.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,680
But he also caught,
oh,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,030
uh,
for doom with that old trick.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,190
He caught him,
knocked him down,

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,490
and then the mistake of federal members,
he jumped into his guard,

14
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:41,640
but remember he jumped into pound,
but he caught him really,

15
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,220
really well.
Knocked him down with the exact same

16
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:47,250
time that he did to everybody before
that.

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,570
So maybe maybe,
or maybe Verdugo goes down on purpose

18
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,560
the moment a punch him so he could drag
you into,

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,233
which he does.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,990
He's a smart guy.
We're doing is a very smart guy.

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,860
Fight fights than Saturday.
Definitely did not face first because he

22
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,290
got tagged.
If you watch the stoppage,

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,820
if you see if you can find the
highlight,

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,640
I'll show it to you because this is
something that I wish somebody brought

25
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:16,641
up during the actual commentary.
He got tagged right before he got

26
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,240
knocked out.
He got tagged doing the same thing with

27
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:20,850
the right hand.
He moved forward.

28
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,410
He was making these advances.
He moved forward.

29
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:26,100
He got tagged with that right hand and I
think he was on Queer Street and I think

30
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,540
he went running at steep a on queer
street and got knocked the fuck out and

31
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:34,140
the way they did it was a fucking work
of art.

32
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,360
The angle,
it was like Anderson Silva and forest

33
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:41,361
baby step to the right and even better.
His angle was sick and obviously his

34
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:43,020
right hand was nasty.

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,600
It's also volume did get hit early and
in boardrooms training.

36
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:53,850
If you've seen him train it,
there's this competition within that.

37
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,030
Jim,
when you get hit it's like,

38
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,400
oh,
got to get them back.

39
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,660
I think it was more gets hit and he was
like,

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,900
go charging bull.
And was like,

41
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,630
fuck this man.
I think it's probably a little of both.

42
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:07,890
I agree because I definitely think both.
He got crack crack and I'm like,

43
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,830
well that is a big right hand that he
got hit with and it's in the same

44
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,360
manner.
Same managed charging.

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,880
40 got hit.
That's how although got knocked out

46
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,714
against Mcgregor.
Yep.

47
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,170
You got to be fucking real careful
charging for

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,140
harder because.
And you know,

49
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,160
Steve Bay's not got some great guys,
but he's not a knockout artist per se.

50
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:28,080
If you compare them to like a mark
Nelson,

51
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,800
he's not knockout artist when the guy's
charging in like that and then you're

52
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,990
counting with right hand,
it makes it seem way.

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,600
Well here's my take on steep based
power.

54
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,070
I think Steve Bay has big power,
but I think he fights economically and

55
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:42,060
intelligently.
He's a smooth fighter,

56
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,050
a boxer.
He's a very good boxer,

57
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:48,030
a golden gloves boxer,
but he's smooth and relaxed in the way

58
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:49,740
he spars.
It's one of the things that makes them

59
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,920
so dangerous because as he does things
very correctly,

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,270
you know,
and I think,

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,600
you know,
DC was on the commentary for the UFC

62
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,440
recently.
He was talking about getting the rub,

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,540
you know,
he was talking about that experience.

64
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,610
When you have a tough fight with
someone,

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,040
you get the rub and he fought junior dos
Santos and they went to war.

66
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,980
What do you mean rubbed?
This is what I mean,

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,690
what he was saying.
He's like,

68
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,460
Daniel says,
when you fight someone that's really

69
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,550
good and they're better than you,
even if you lose you,

70
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,600
it elevates you.

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,530
You get the rub like just by sharing the
ring with them just by being in that re,

72
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,320
by competing with them,
you realize how good you are when you

73
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,920
actually get better and you realize how
good that person is.

74
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,210
Yeah.
I think he got the rub when he fought

75
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,930
junior dos Santos in a way because he
went five rounds with a guy who was the

76
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:34,120
one of the toughest of the tough guy was
at Warren,

77
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,780
a champion or knocked out Cain Velasquez
was one punch and he went five hard

78
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,440
rounds with them and the decision will
could have went either way and took his

79
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:44,440
best shot.
And I also think that to go back to

80
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,270
[inaudible] point and your point with
the rub,

81
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,650
I think at the UTC level of special
wouldn't get in that top echelon.

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,610
You know,
you're getting,

83
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:55,810
people are telling you you're good,
but like when he beat Orlowski starched

84
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:55,960
them.

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,760
You don't learn much from that man.
When he go up to a decision with a world

86
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,780
class guy,
then you know,

87
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,670
like you're doing something right,
your camp,

88
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,500
you're doing it right,
you had good gas,

89
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,510
you realize what works,
what does it.

90
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,790
So you learn so much more and he's going
to,

91
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,520
like you said,
more with jds and we see them getting

92
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:17,170
better and better.
What's really interesting now is here's

93
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,130
the dark horse that nobody talks about.
Stephan Struve is only 28 years old.

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,330
That fucking dude is gigantic.
He's seven feet tall.

95
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,240
And if he could put it together and he
put it together on big foot silver the

96
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,260
other night,
knocked him out.

97
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,570
I love the guy has a bunch of knockout
losses.

98
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,880
I know he does,
but he knocked out steepbank.

99
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,170
Struve got steeper
in the UFC.

100
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,990
Yeah,
dude,

101
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,890
Dude Struve do not count that guy out
yet.

102
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,740
Struve did an inside leg kick and then
he's got that heart issue and stuff.

103
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,480
Well,
I don't know what he's got going on

104
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,610
physically,
but I'm saying that kid,

105
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,970
if he puts it all together when you're
seven feet tall,

106
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,750
how long does it take before you even
get coordinated?

107
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:58,090
Right.
I mean it's like you're sending a

108
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:02,290
message and it's got to go so far before
it gets to your fucking hand.

109
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,830
I mean,
have you ever thought you fought guys

110
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,790
are super tall like Jack Man,
those guys.

111
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:11,791
I mean it like.
The thing is is steep aid would be,

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,130
or not Steve,
a strew would be such a fricking handful

113
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:19,090
of could learn to use his reach,
but you guys like Roy Nelson.

114
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,750
When you get these upper echelon guys,
you know,

115
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,080
nothing gets bigfoot but off trt or
whatever the case,

116
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:26,250
he actually needs it off it.

117
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,560
It's,
I think anyone that top 20 kinda them

118
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,150
up,
but with truth,

119
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,860
the real test of me who they give them
next,

120
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,120
that's true.
Got fucked up.

121
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,880
I over him and over and was joy
superintelligent.

122
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,470
Fight the way father,
it took him down.

123
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,950
Beautiful.
Take down on top of him.

124
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:41,820
Just ground and pound.
The thing about struve's,

125
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,320
you've got to realize that kid has I
think 40 fights.

126
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,520
Yeah.
Here's a shitload of miles now.

127
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,210
His heart,
heart and the mark.

128
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,350
What will have it does not.
No,

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,050
but it's.
I don't know what he's got.

130
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,480
What is the medical condition?
I forget.

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,830
We have the same manager,
so he deals with it all the time.

132
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,080
That Mark Hunt knockouts,
Jesus Christ Marco,

133
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,330
would that leaching left hook shattered
his face.

134
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,620
Oh Dude.
Mark on it.

135
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,230
So fucking you've been caged.
Sad scene that.

136
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,240
Oh,
it's fast.

137
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,560
Too
steep a can get.

138
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,540
I'm curious to see if they can get but
within boxing distance of allister and

139
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,400
take away any of those kicks and how he
sets it up.

140
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,010
It's going to be interesting.
Alster combox man.

141
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
He can't.
Oh yeah,

142
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,060
for sure.
Better than to tell you knocked out

143
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,310
junior with one punch.
That's good.

144
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,410
He's the best striker in the UFC
heavyweight division maybe of all time.

145
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:33,770
So.
So.

146
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,840
So Steve,
Steve Bay,

147
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,180
then it's going to have to close that
distance and knocks him.

148
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,530
Not necessarily note Steve Bay could
crack him.

149
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:40,880
Look,
Ben Rothwell knocked him out in the

150
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:42,450
first round cup.
Has better fulfilled,

151
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,920
can happen.
Footwork and house has been stopped a

152
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,870
lot.
Chins the question.

153
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,910
This is the other thing people forget
with allister.

154
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,140
Then we'll fucking grapple.
Oh yeah.

155
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,930
In wrestling.
Grappling his ass off.

156
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,130
So you want to go to the ground with
them?

157
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,150
You're gonna be in a world of trouble.

158
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,440
Well he won the Abu Dhabi European
trials and in pride he submitted tour.

159
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,270
He's got an.
He also submitted Mark Hunt.

160
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,090
He has a nasty guillotine.
Dude.

161
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,910
His team always forgetting about
birthing of just as a striker,

162
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,580
but you want to go to the ground.
I don't think Steve Bay has a lot of

163
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:14,240
submission.
Work under is so steep and I trained for

164
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,300
two years together.
That kid has submission defense.

165
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,950
So you're not were shot as his black
belt.

166
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,850
If you asked Rashad to show you like
Omoplata a real specific,

167
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,770
uh,
offensive move.

168
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,530
It's,
I don't think at that black belt level,

169
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,750
but his defense and that's steep based
defense is nes super nasty.

170
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,250
It's just what?
He's really good at.

171
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,500
Defense.
He's a very smart athlete,

172
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,610
you know,
and it's when you have a guy who's a who

173
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,130
could probably be a professional ball
player,

174
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,250
right?
You Will Bay.

175
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,010
He could probably be a professional
ball.

176
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,130
He didn't make it.
Yeah,

177
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,280
he didn't make it.
He's at this level of an,

178
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,780
of an athlete.
Now.

179
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:54,620
What I'm saying is it's rare that you
see a guy like that who comes over to

180
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,920
mma and fights like super technical,
super smart,

181
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,490
who's also really,
really tough firefighter for

182
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,420
professional,
full time head.

183
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,090
His head is the biggest head I've ever,
ever seen into large set.

184
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,960
Nicest guy.
He's a great guy,

185
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,260
but he's.
He's got a rare set of attributes,

186
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,470
meaning that he's at pro sports athlete
level,

187
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,320
like as far as like like his,
his ability,

188
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:22,010
his movement and his intelligence in his
approach and his training and then on

189
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:27,011
top of that he's tough as fuck stuff is
tough as fuck.

190
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,180
Like in this fight.
Let me tell you something,

191
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:31,850
dude,
I watched this fight very careful and

192
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:36,350
one of the things that I was noticing
was how calm he was through everything

193
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,340
through the walk.

194
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,930
When they watch,
when they're staring each other down.

195
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,680
One of the things you really pay
attention to is the shortness of the

196
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:46,340
breathing.
If you watch people breathing during,

197
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,820
I'm like nervous situations.
A lot of times even if they look calm,

198
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,380
you could sort of see this uneasiness in
the way they're taking in oxygen.

199
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,400
You're sensing tension,
not seeing.

200
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,080
You don't sense any of that shit looking
at,

201
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:01,380
you know what's impressive to if he
doesn't come from like a mastermind

202
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:02,214
camp?
No,

203
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,050
it's just his boys and Cleveland.
Well,

204
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:07,290
he just might have a mastermind can be.
There's a lot of masterminds out there

205
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,590
that don't have the right pupils.
I'm saying he's not from like a

206
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,490
Jackson's Aka the att.
He kicks his shit within Cleveland and

207
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:18,180
does work and then goes and saves people
from burning buildings.

208
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,540
Who else is in that?
That camp is the guard style.

209
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,770
MMA.
There's also the.

210
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,410
Isn't there a Leslie Smith from there?
No,

211
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
it's not.
Raquel Pennington,

212
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:29,570
Right Jessica?
I'm Jessica.

213
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,610
I'm so.
They have tough fighters.

214
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:36,780
It's just like if a guy's like a really
skillful trainer and you know you've

215
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:39,570
only been doing it for a few years,
you have to wait for the right guy to

216
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,600
sort of walk through your door.
Then walking through the door with Eddie

217
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,780
Bravo with Eddie Bravo.
Took forever for him to find someone who

218
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:53,781
could do his style and prove in
competition that it's very effective.

219
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,740
Not just with him.
He had a unique style phase.

220
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,310
Brother or dad.
The guy with the mustache.

221
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,120
I look at that guy with a mustache,
guys.

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,033
Awesome.
Though.

223
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,830
You talked about being calm.
Remember he's fighting right now.

224
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,180
That guy's not that old.
Brian.

225
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:09,390
Why are you calling that guy his dad?
Because his older brother,

226
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,780
his older brother.
I guarantee it all.

227
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,890
Just some fucking thick dude.
You Know Eddie Bravo had a real good

228
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,340
point about this.
We were talking about on the phone.

229
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,520
He was like,
Fabrizio look too relaxed.

230
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,830
He liked.
He was coming up to the,

231
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
to the ring.
He was making that face that he may say,

232
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,500
yeah,
I'm so sick of that face.

233
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,940
Oh,
he's being funny.

234
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,400
It's being silly.
I don't think there's anything wrong

235
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,040
with a fighter trying to stay loose.
Don't at all.

236
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,750
You know.
I think that's one of the things that

237
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,580
fabrizio does to have a good time.
He likes to make that silly.

238
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,720
He's been doing it forever.
He's the man he's bullied for ever do

239
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,240
them.
If you won the fight and made that face,

240
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,570
no one say a fucking word.
If you went out there and head kicked,

241
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,870
steep meo chick,
you know,

242
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,610
no one would say a word,
but it didn't work out.

243
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,610
So when it doesn't work out,
that's when everybody comes shitting on

244
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,444
you.
It's the same.

245
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,520
What's the same with connor?
Connor?

246
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,240
Connor was walking out like,
you know,

247
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:03,360
same with Rhonda.
When Ronda lost everybody's mad at all

248
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,600
the shit that they loved her for,
they love to for don't be a do nothing,

249
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,180
bitch and fuck you.
I'm making it to the top.

250
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,510
Kiss my ass.
Or they hate it.

251
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,680
They now we think she's arrogant to
that.

252
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Same with Canada.
If

253
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,720
he's in Venice right now,
driving around a royals Royce just

254
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,740
wiling out,
look,

255
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,710
I just,
you know,

256
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:26,250
it's just what comes.
It's part of what people love about

257
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,200
people bragging or they want to bring
you down though,

258
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,200
man.
Look how loose deep it looks because

259
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,720
loose.
I mean he's fighting for the title nice

260
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,370
and loose,
so he moves away.

261
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,860
Keeping argued.
He should've got title earlier too,

262
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:41,520
but he's like,
he's just such a nice guy and a lot of

263
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,310
checking to.

264
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,870
Lot of good checking of kicks,
a kid's ties.

265
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,690
Very good luck.
Very educated with his movements and

266
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,840
look for breezy.
Who's got some fucking nasty kicks man?

267
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,090
And he's like right there.
His striking is much improved.

268
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,890
We saw it in the Travis Brown fight,
man.

269
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,160
Dangerous on the feet,
man.

270
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,130
Alaska is dude.
His striking is fucking legit.

271
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,730
He's long shit and he's got confidence
in it.

272
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,550
That nice switch kick there.
Yeah,

273
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,140
but he's a beast.
I think in order to be that dangerous of

274
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,090
a fighter,
you're going to have to open yourself up

275
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,550
a little bit.
Then when you fight a real strategic guy

276
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,530
like steep a,
you're to get a little bit of trouble.

277
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,630
Well,
I think what happened in this fight in

278
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,270
particular is that he forced it.
Yes,

279
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,030
thank.
He was in this gigantic soccer arena.

280
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,420
It's the biggest crowd in history and
mma in Brazil.

281
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,550
Look at that beautiful leg kick though
though.

282
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,360
Yeah,
the inside 90 Chad that to.

283
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,020
Yeah,
it's all nice.

284
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,680
Like the technique is real nice,
but I think for Breesa was just so

285
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,250
ramped up because there's all these
people in Brazil and I think he's a

286
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,650
confident man.
I think he thinks he's the fucking best

287
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,750
in the world.
He just has to get ahold of this dude.

288
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,070
There's a right hand and nailed the.
See,

289
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,280
so now we can take a shot tab.
But now.

290
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,780
But now look,
he's forcing it.

291
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,790
Forcing it because he landed it.
Yeah.

292
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,590
So Watch.
When he starts to force it,

293
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,580
he gets hit real hard and then he gets
hit hard and knocked out.

294
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,540
He tried that knee,
tries forward and when sees he got a

295
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,780
terrible single attempt there.
That was like such a.

296
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,860
you're like getting steeper on that.
He was also,

297
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,370
I mean he might've been just trying to
make them work,

298
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,320
but look,
maybe open up possibilities.

299
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,380
I think you dropped for a single mind.
Right?

300
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,470
And so he's not afraid to just be
writing their girls.

301
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,490
Not though be he's not reading range,
but he's real relaxed.

302
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,220
Even the waste throwing that chap,
that top,

303
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,720
top,
top now like he's economical and when

304
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,230
your economical and a five round fight
super chat.

305
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,830
I was a very nice legs by fabrizio.
He's timing that jasmine great inside

306
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:39,220
leg kick in.
The Jab also is super light.

307
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,340
Like he's just floating it out there.
Pop his nice lots of steps.

308
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,760
20 Jepson.
We stepped to the side there like that.

309
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,540
Like look at that jacket on sale like
that is to talk,

310
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,890
you know he's not,
there's no tension there.

311
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,010
You know what I'm saying?
Like it's like flowing a check that link

312
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,150
again,
nice leg kick by.

313
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,590
Steep.
A nice switch.

314
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,760
So right now for Mesa was realizing
like,

315
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:04,750
okay,
this is an easy part.

316
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,370
That's the one you're reading right
here.

317
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,500
Bang.
That's the chaos.

318
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,140
Now back it up again,
watch just just back it up just a little

319
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,950
bit to where it's chasing them.
So watching these channels,

320
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,920
he got rocky NBA players.
Really?

321
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,450
You're correct.
You're right.

322
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:21,800
I saw the correct though,
Joe.

323
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,140
I didn't see that until.
And he got mad and he came out.

324
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,980
Yes,
yes.

325
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,990
He got his tag.
Yeah.

326
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,400
He got tagged hard with that right hand.
That's right.

327
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,640
And then he kept charging and then he
got face planted with the second one

328
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,010
that,
that first right hand had him on Queer

329
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,600
Street.
I guarantee you because he's moving

330
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:39,110
forward and steep a drops it in on them
and it's the same punch he knocked him

331
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,440
out with and it's when when Steve Bay
throws a punch and this is how,

332
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:45,590
you know he's good at me,
obviously fucking good,

333
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:47,050
but this is how you,
you know,

334
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,710
techniques at a real high level.

335
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,890
His arm is like loose and then he throws
it and then as it gets to his face he

336
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,150
tightens it down.
It does this stack like as he's moving

337
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,480
away,
he's like,

338
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,490
it's a super efficient,
like really technical punch to the

339
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,270
throat that way.
Moving back back.

340
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,770
In that sense,
it's very much like what Anderson did.

341
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,890
Forrest Griffin.
It's also calculated because you threw

342
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,050
it twice and they both land and there
built.

343
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,300
You can tell they're working on it.
So he threw.

344
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,050
He threw the,
the,

345
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,400
the,
the left hook twice to check,

346
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,711
right?
Yeah.

347
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,120
Moving back,
moving back and something as he stepped

348
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,370
into the side when he does that or you
had to guess it doesn't even necessarily

349
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,160
have to be that he planned it out and
that was a part of the game plan.

350
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,950
I think Steve Bay does that.
I think he's a really good striker.

351
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,190
If you look at his movie.
Yeah,

352
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,740
and I think you're looking at a guy
who's super fucking determined,

353
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:42,530
man.
Steve Bay is super determined and when

354
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:46,280
you're a guy that's that focused,
you're going to get fucking really good

355
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:48,370
at everything.
So after he gets that fight,

356
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,790
that Jab,
Jab,

357
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,540
it's like an upper customer.
It is too.

358
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,300
It's so everything he's doing is so
relaxed and efficient.

359
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,260
You don't see a lot of jazz for
Bluetooth.

360
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,400
Can you see a lot of jobs?
Like my all time favorite fighter?

361
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:04,310
Probably if I were to tell you who I was
most excited to see you fight is

362
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,470
probably vandelay phone.
Boom.

363
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:08,970
See that right hand?
Russian is fucking hurt here.

364
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,810
Yeah,
he got mad.

365
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,680
He didn't just get mad.
His legs jolted.

366
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,460
He had like you could see his legs
stiffen up when he got hit by that first

367
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,210
right hand.

368
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,570
He got hurt and then the second one face
plant some steep.

369
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:24,350
Pays a dangerous guy.
He's not going to make mistakes.

370
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,800
They Cleveland.
Let's get our boy a goddamn parade.

371
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:27,670
No one.
When Shit.

372
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:28,540
No Shit.
He.

373
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,020
Lebron.
You want a jacket?

374
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,980
Real other UFC fighters.
How would you tweet out about steepen

375
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,840
your boys from your home town.
He jumped off the fence.

376
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:36,890
He goes,
I'm the world champ,

377
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,010
the world champ.
He was like,

378
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,430
it was like coming into his,
his,

379
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,680
his,
his mind like,

380
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:45,020
is this real information?
Hey Lebron.

381
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,810
Did that just fucking game of fucking.
Yeah,

382
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,730
I love it.
I love that man.

383
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,860
I love him.
I love what he stands for.

384
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:55,310
I love watching him as a fighter.
I love that he could do that.

385
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,650
I love it.
I love that he did it in Brazil.

386
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,180
Look at this.
Watch this.

387
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,150
Watch how fish.

388
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,490
Stupid.
See it's pink.

389
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
Oh yeah.
He just dropped it in,

390
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:04,810
um,
to,

391
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,100
to be able to time it that good to look
at this.

392
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Watch the timing.
He pushes his hand away and then put the

393
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,220
same hand.
Did you see overeem?

394
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,330
Overeem's tweet and crack.
Yeah.

395
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,500
Yeah.
He wants to fight him.

396
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,990
You said your neck and he did the
bloodsport me see that?

397
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,500
That one showed both that.
That highlight right there was the

398
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:30,650
perfect high left to the right because
it showed the first one that how much

399
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:34,730
impact the first one had on them.
The first punch was a big factor there,

400
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:36,380
man.
That first punch had him.

401
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,610
Cole.
Weird up.

402
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:40,040
Unbelievable man.
So cool.

403
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,870
I like that.
You could still say Queer Street and

404
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:43,920
you're not a homophobe queer streets.
Fun.

405
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,550
It's just strange.
You know,

406
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,280
like what,
where am I at?

407
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,110
The heavyweight division is

408
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,970
fun right now,
man,

409
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,070
because I don't think we're gonna see a
champ.

410
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,030
Rain for a long time.
