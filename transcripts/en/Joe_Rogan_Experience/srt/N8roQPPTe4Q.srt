1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,740
Yeah,
he's a,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,330
I think he's too smart,
too smart to talk to regular people.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,130
Boom.
Powerful big wave surfer.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,720
How are you buddy?
I'm great.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,940
We just got back from playing little 
techno hunt.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,190
We did manage a greatest thing of all 
time,

7
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,024
right?
I was just saying I don't care what the 

8
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:18,840
price is.
It's worth it.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,800
It's a bargain at twice the price of 
whatever it is.

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,390
Yeah.
Where people don't know what it is.

11
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:27,050
It's his game that it simulates 
bowhunting.

12
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:27,910
So what it is,
is,

13
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,380
is a giant screen that's made out of 
Kevlar and then uh,

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,540
it's got us like a projector projects,
hd images of elk and deer.

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,660
You could set it up for a bunch of 
different animals,

16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,823
but elk and deer walk across the screen 
and you shoot at them and it's like the 

17
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:47,060
perfect.
There's a,

18
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,090
we show a little video,
Shane bannon earlier.

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,510
It's really cool,
man.

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,373
It's a perfect practice for bow hunting 
because one of the things about bow 

21
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,480
hunting is you get nervous and the more 
you could do something like this,

22
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,460
we just shot a perfect shot.
The more you could do that.

23
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,870
Over and over and over again,
the more it becomes ingrained in your,

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,710
your,
your nervous system,

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,900
ingrained in your muscles,
ingrained in your memory,

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,450
and then it becomes natural.
Yeah,

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,470
it's awesome.
Yeah,

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,333
it's pretty dope.
We're going to make this podcast about 

29
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:16,390
15 minutes long.
Go back and shit.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,993
Yeah,
that's what we were actually talking 

31
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:20,750
about.
Cutting off the podcast.

32
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:23,120
Short for that.
So tell me about this movie man.

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,250
Yeah.
So I'm in La for the premier,

34
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:30,070
the HBO Premiere of the Momentum 
Generation.

35
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,060
It's a,
it's a,

36
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,980
uh,
it's a sports documentary that,

37
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,610
that,
uh,

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,460
that Hbo and Robert Redford did.
So it's cool,

39
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:36,851
man.
It's,

40
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:37,930
it's,
it's really cool.

41
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,690
It's um,
it's a story about my friends and I,

42
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,291
we,
you know,

43
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,124
we all grew up a competitive surfers and
in high school we all sort of met each 

44
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,410
other through,
through competitions competing.

45
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,080
So this tells a story of how he,
basically,

46
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:51,700
how we met,
how we grew up,

47
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,603
um,
and how we became friends and family 

48
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:55,930
basically like traveling around the 
world,

49
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,453
you know,
together as basically like little kids 

50
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,750
with no with no chaperones on,
on tour around the world.

51
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:02,980
So it's fucking crazy.
It's,

52
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,330
it's a,
it's a wild story.

53
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,640
Pulled us up to keep this like a fist 
away.

54
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,310
How old were you when you first started 
surfing?

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,600
Started surfing on a standup surfboard 
when I was five.

56
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,190
And when did you start traveling?
Serve?

57
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,533
When I was 12,
I went to England for the world amateur 

58
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:21,404
championships.
So I was on the Hawaii Team doing this 

59
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,830
traveling surfing thing most of your 
life?

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,480
Yeah.
Wow,

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,850
that's crazy.
That is nuts,

62
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,150
man.
I been,

63
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,003
I been putting my surfboards in a board 
bag and walking out the door with my 

64
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,324
passport since I was 12 and going to so 
many different destinations around the 

65
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:43,394
world,
literally just for surfing wire nuts 

66
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,810
does such a crazy way to grow up and 
that.

67
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:47,644
That's a cool thing about the film is 
all of us have that in common and it's 

68
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,153
crazy the way the story set up too 
because there's so many things in it 

69
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:57,170
that I didn't really realize were 
happening at the time.

70
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,970
Like,
like I came from,

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,490
I came from a broken family,
alcoholic father,

72
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,653
kind of radical situation at home and 
then like a lot of us had like broken 

73
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,914
families,
a lot of us had that in common so we 

74
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:15,880
sort of have like this weird fucked up 
family dynamic in common.

75
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,360
So we all became sort of like our own 
family on the road.

76
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,560
So we were competing for a world title.
We're all competing and going around the

77
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,180
world all the time,
staying together.

78
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,463
So we became best friends like this 
nucleus of surfers and we all just 

79
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,244
became ultra close and then when things 
get really serious with a surfing 

80
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,014
competition and there was a lot on the 
line with sponsors and money and big 

81
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,910
brands coming in.
The shit hit the fan.

82
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,000
And then we started like breaking up.
It got two series.

83
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,983
It was almost like a band who just 
couldn't stand each other anymore or 

84
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,240
things got too radical,
you know,

85
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,960
girls got in the way or money got in the
way.

86
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,080
And so there was like this kinda like 
breaking up element,

87
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,730
you know,
throughout our group.

88
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,983
Wow.
I would imagine when you're living like 

89
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,120
that,
those people must be so valuable for you

90
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:01,954
though.
People that can understand your way of 

91
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,984
life because it's their way of life too,
because like to to a regular person who 

92
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,940
commutes every day and goes to an office
comes home like your life is alien.

93
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,350
Yeah,
it is.

94
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,963
I still get like,
I still get uncomfortable when people 

95
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,840
asked me what I do for a living,
you know,

96
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,020
like I'll be in like a normal random 
setting and some of you,

97
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,780
the Leo,
what do you do for a living?

98
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,620
And I'm like,
no,

99
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,190
do not ask me that because nobody 
understands.

100
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,024
You know?
It's like,

101
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,180
what do you tell them?
I tell them the truth,

102
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:36,390
but it's,
I just always tell them like it's,

103
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,050
it's really hard to explain.

104
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,380
But I served for a living and do,
what the fuck is that?

105
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,310
Yeah.
Did they go?

106
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,870
How does that work?
How do you get paid?

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,550
Yes.
All the time.

108
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,680
And I just go.
I have no idea.

109
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,603
Well,
you don't really compete any longer 

110
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,170
right now.
Just not at all ride big waves.

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,400
I do.
All right.

112
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:55,234
Big Waves,
that's my focus and I also write all 

113
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,850
kinds of waves.
I surf every day and you know,

114
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,020
the waves don't get big that often when 
the waves are biggest,

115
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:04,030
I'm on it.
Yeah.

116
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,893
For a person that like is just meeting 
you for the first time and doesn't 

117
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:13,270
understand surfing and is trying to wrap
their head around making a living,

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,530
riding the waves of the ocean.
It was a house wife.

119
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,510
Wait a minute.
No,

120
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:22,210
I went to accounting school and I and I 
don't have,

121
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,890
there's not like a,
there's nothing.

122
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,723
I mean there's,
there's not like another category I can 

123
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,701
really point to,
to,

124
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,710
to,
to make the point go quicker to.

125
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,113
There's not like,
um,

126
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,790
you know,
it's like there's basketball players and

127
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,624
football players and all of them were 
like scoring goals and getting these 

128
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,000
brand endorsements from that,
from competition element.

129
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:44,110
So because I'm a free surfer who doesn't
compete at all,

130
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,910
it's just,
it's hard to wrap your head around,

131
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,170
but they've been harder.
Yeah.

132
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:47,951
Basically,
I,

133
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:48,590
you know,
I,

134
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,091
I,
I,

135
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,940
uh,
you know,

136
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,703
I have a,
a large surfing profile and so like I 

137
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,530
work with a lot of brands and that's 
just the kind of,

138
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,160
the way it works.
It just sponsors.

139
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,013
Yep.
Yeah.

140
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,220
Now this movie,
this documentary,

141
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,440
did they have footage of you guys from 
when you were really young?

142
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,180
Oh yeah,
yeah,

143
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,490
they do.
Is that weird watching that stuff?

144
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,713
Yeah,
very weird because we're all in our 

145
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:13,070
forties now.
We all got kids and for most of us,

146
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,510
except for Kelly Kelly still going,
you 40,

147
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,110
46 years old.
I,

148
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:17,944
I,
I saw him on your show the other day is 

149
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,480
pretty classic,
but so,

150
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,940
so he's like a focal point in the film.
He's,

151
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,570
he's part of the momentum generation and
um,

152
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,703
and so he,
there is incredible footage of him when 

153
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:31,610
he's nine years old or 10 years old and 
he's in Florida,

154
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:35,660
like a little rat,
like a little sunburn rat and it's neat.

155
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,190
You know what I mean?
I mean we all had that in common.

156
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,630
That's we,
we all grew up in,

157
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,170
in different places and then we all fell
in love with surfing,

158
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,490
you know,
separately,

159
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:46,100
and then we all just became super tight,
so.

160
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,170
Wow.
It was great.

161
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,050
It's a,
it's great.

162
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,390
And then now we're all like best friends
again because there's no,

163
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,050
there's no points on a line or a world 
title on the line or like brands getting

164
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,670
in the way or girls getting in the way.
We're all,

165
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:56,760
we're all,
you know,

166
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,473
we're finally growing up that.
I mean that had to be strange though to 

167
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:08,081
be so tight and then everything sort of 
get bottlenecked by the pressure.

168
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,643
Yup.

169
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,340
Anything serving,
how much pressure could there be?

170
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:13,930
But you know,
we're all trying to make a living,

171
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:14,441
right?
It's like,

172
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:15,430
no,
you know,

173
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,264
that was our dream to surf as much as 
possible and see the world and that's 

174
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,970
the only way you could do it for us.
Whenever there's competition,

175
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:24,010
there's got to be massive amounts of 
pressure.

176
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:24,844
Whenever there's someone trying to 
achieve something or someone trying to 

177
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,270
rise to the top of a profession and 
you're surrounded by a bunch,

178
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,143
but you also must have pushed each other
to and it must have been beneficial to 

179
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:40,141
have people like you around as well.
I think it's part of,

180
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,671
it's just,
you know,

181
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,620
I think it's like part of our,
our human DNA to,

182
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,170
you know,
to be naturally competitive.

183
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,004
So I think especially men,
I think that we feel like we have 

184
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,300
something to prove,
you know,

185
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,550
like where we stand compared to the 
other guys were,

186
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,630
whether it was like in the cave man days
or,

187
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,800
or like the,
you know,

188
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,873
the first hunters.
Whereas it was like for sure they were 

189
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:01,274
there.
They were competitive too so you could 

190
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,460
bring home meat for the,
for the tribe.

191
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,550
And then it just kept going from there.
And,

192
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:07,961
and,
and,

193
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:08,860
and now we,
we,

194
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,260
we compete with whatever we're into and 
you know,

195
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,103
for us with surfing we came hyper 
competitive and especially me like from 

196
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,040
the time I was like maybe 16 or 17 total
time,

197
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,883
I was like my mid twenties.
I was like super competitive where I 

198
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:26,390
want to rip people's heads off my heat,
like I would like visualize horrible,

199
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:31,391
horrible things happening to them while 
I was competing against them and it's so

200
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:35,660
crazy how that's gone.
One hundred percent gone from my.

201
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,590
My being now,
I can't even imagine doing that.

202
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,610
I'm like the most relaxed,
non competitive person.

203
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,830
I have no competitiveness left in my 
body.

204
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,150
Well,
I've only known you for what,

205
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:48,270
four years or something like that in 
those years I could not imagine you have

206
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:51,620
an evil thoughts towards someone who 
seem so chill.

207
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,090
I was a shit talker.
Or are you really?

208
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,470
Yeah,
I,

209
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,170
I,

210
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,900
I remember I was surfing as this Guy 
Damien hardman and,

211
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,550
and he was like an Australian world 
champion.

212
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,423
He was like an older generation.
We were from the young new school 

213
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,453
generation were coming up and there's 
these established guys who didn't want 

214
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:08,731
it,
but you know,

215
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,070
like bd thrown in.
There was this Guy Damien hardman who is

216
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:11,904
a bad ass competitive surfer,
but he was a very like tactician 

217
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,660
conservative.
You'd never fall.

218
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,670
He seemed like a nerd in me.
You know what I mean?

219
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,683
I was like raw kid from Hawaii and this 
guy was like so presentable and 

220
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:25,404
professional and I just presented it and
I was in a heat with him and he got 

221
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:29,904
priority,
which means that he had first right of 

222
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,100
wave and I just needed a tiny little 
score to win and he basically sat on me,

223
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:38,214
which means he uses it.
He used his priority to chase me around 

224
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:45,600
the lineup and sit on me and keep me 
from cutting a wave and let the time run

225
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:45,960
out.

226
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,690
And the whole time I was like,
you surf like a girl?

227
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,843
He served for like a little bitch.
Like I was like totally shit talking to 

228
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,690
him.
And did it work?

229
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,410
Did he get you?
He got me because he wrote the I,

230
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,483
I,
I,

231
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,120
I basically cracked and started like 
getting emotional and he loved it.

232
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,890
He went,
I got this guy beat.

233
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,900
He started to shit talk me.
He loved that.

234
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:07,820
I any,
any,

235
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,673
uh,
he actually came up to me later and he 

236
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,310
goes,
I love it that you're that passionate.

237
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,144
I love it that you got that site.
And that emotional where you just 

238
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,450
started,
like trying to like insult me.

239
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,523
He's like,
that's my goal when I'm in heats with 

240
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,800
people is to get them to that point.
You know?

241
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,650
It must like,
that's good.

242
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,720
There's got to be a lot of parallels.
The fight world,

243
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,280
right?
Yeah.

244
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,263
Well it's also when,
when you can get someone emotional than 

245
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,670
fighting in particular is so dangerous.
And so when you lose,

246
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,730
you're not just losing like someone's 
taking a piece of you,

247
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,160
you know,
because they're fucking you up.

248
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,710
They're not.
It's not just beating you on points.

249
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,990
I mean there are beating on point 
sometimes,

250
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:48,760
but they're punching you in the face to 
beat you on those points here,

251
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,360
the kicking you in the body,
they're fucking your legs up.

252
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,223
There's,
there's something about that that's so 

253
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:57,120
intensely emotional.
So when you're fighting,

254
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,223
you're fighting at your best.
You have to be in this sort of flow 

255
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,160
state,
this sort of Zen,

256
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,880
not thinking about anything but what's 
happening and reacting and just going on

257
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:10,020
your training and your instincts.
And if you can get a guy to be angry and

258
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:10,854
emotional,
it will severely impair for most 

259
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,920
fighters,
severely impair your ability to perform.

260
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,980
Most fighters,
they lose to get tense.

261
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,113
They tighten up,
they look to wind up instead of just 

262
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:23,484
letting things flow.
We're talking about this guy style 

263
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:29,760
bender who fought this weekend.
That guy follows like when you watch him

264
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:31,530
fight,
he just flows.

265
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,050
I mean he walks into the octagon 
dancing.

266
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,273
Yeah,
I mean like full on dancing like pop in 

267
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,480
and moving and has that mindset.
He's just,

268
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,700
he just gets loose and when he gets in 
there,

269
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,420
he's switching stances and he's what?
What?

270
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,254
There was a mad shit talking session 
between these two guys for the last six 

271
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:49,824
weeks,
but he stayed calm through the whole 

272
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,190
thing.
And you could when the two

273
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,890
gun into the octagon,
Derek Brunson just couldn't wait to just

274
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:01,180
grab a hold of them and style bender 
just avoided all that shit.

275
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:03,010
And one of Kale and I'm in the first 
round.

276
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:07,140
But the emotional aspect of the shit 
talking and the,

277
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:07,974
the,
the tension that it brings because it 

278
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:11,800
tightens guys up.
Like we were talking about bow hunting.

279
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,880
Like you see a big elk,
you have one shot at a big elk,

280
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,520
one shot,
you draw back your bow and you're like,

281
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,354
Holy Shit.
And it's literally a life or death 

282
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,440
moment.
So there's all this tension.

283
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,440
And if you could alleviate that tension,
that pressure,

284
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,880
you will,
you would perform better.

285
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,650
The mindset is everything.
It's everything.

286
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:30,910
It's everything.
It's everything.

287
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,600
It's everything with golf,
it's everything with pool.

288
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,300
It's everything with any,
anytime there's something on the line.

289
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,283
But what's fascinating is like for you,
like you've watched thousands of fights 

290
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,610
like ringside,
right?

291
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,580
Yeah,
sure.

292
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,760
So like you must be like,
hey,

293
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,890
we're in the second round and this guy 
is,

294
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,870
you know,
these two guys are like up and up.

295
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,561
It's,
you know,

296
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,394
it's like a,
it's like a super tight fight and you 

297
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:56,350
guys have a good fight and there must be
an inflection points where you instantly

298
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:00,100
know that one guy is going to lose.
Like something happens with their psyche

299
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,380
or something happens out there.
You can see in their eyes,

300
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,930
you can see it in their body language.
All of a sudden they lose that,

301
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,400
that edge,
that mindset,

302
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,234
and they are basically have already lost
even though it's like right in the 

303
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:12,620
middle of the round.
So then you see one guy that's like the.

304
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,550
One of the crazy things about fighting 
is it's so unpredictable.

305
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,170
Even when you think God is going to 
lose,

306
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,150
sometimes they come back and win by 
knockout,

307
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:20,050
like out of nowhere.

308
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,900
I just had a fight sport.
Who are those?

309
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,760
Yeah,
the guy with an awesome instagram.

310
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,390
Yeah.
Black Dude.

311
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,940
Dude.
He was losing that fight.

312
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,220
I'm not a fight nerd.
No,

313
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,870
he was getting fucked up.
He was Lou.

314
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,461
I'm like,
dude,

315
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,180
the guy's losing the fight.
There's zero chance to win next year.

316
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:35,790
No,
he,

317
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,330
yeah.
That was so exciting.

318
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,303
Volkov,
the guy he beat had just beaten for 

319
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,030
overdoing who's a former heavyweight 
champion.

320
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,900
Beat him by knockout.
So,

321
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:45,970
uh,
Alexander's the real deal.

322
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:46,510
I mean,
he's a.

323
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,660
He was what I thought was the dark horse
in the heavyweight division,

324
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,853
but he stood in front of Derek for too 
long and derrick hit him with a fucking 

325
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,903
bomb.
He had heard them earlier too because 

326
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,423
derrick derrick hit him and knocked his 
mouthpiece out and he didn't know his 

327
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:01,234
mouthpiece was gone.
The referee was trying to get into the 

328
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,570
Nazis.

329
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,001
He's like,
no,

330
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,650
that's not my mouthpiece.
That's his mouthpiece,

331
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,880
and the referee was like,
motherfucker,

332
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,040
you don't have a mouthpiece.
I'm holding your mouthpiece,

333
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,870
your mindset.
He's in the zone.

334
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:12,310
Dude.
I don't think he was in the zone.

335
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,144
I think he was in space.
That's that mindset of either had been 

336
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:22,030
clipped,
but fighting like the nature of fighting

337
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,670
is built for competition.
It's perfectly suited to competition.

338
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:28,630
Surfing's not right surfing.
I think surfing is like the least suited

339
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:29,464
for competition.
I don't see surfing as a sport 

340
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:32,740
whatsoever because when you're on the 
wave,

341
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:33,574
you have to be zen.
You have to go with the flow of the 

342
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,604
wave.
You're not really competing against 

343
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:39,190
another person per se,
even though you are.

344
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,040
You're really riding the wave and you're
being judged.

345
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,470
Which is weird because it's artists,
I humans.

346
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,310
Yeah.
But I think the,

347
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,173
I think the single most important aspect
of surfing that makes it not good for 

348
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,020
competition is you're dealing with 
mother nature.

349
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,070
It's completely unfair.
Right?

350
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:56,840
Right,
right.

351
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,490
Like,
you might get an awesome wave.

352
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,470
The next guy might get a shitty one.
Yeah.

353
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:01,304
Some kid who on a scale of one to 10,
their ability levels like a three can 

354
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:10,391
beat the Kelly slater in a heat easily 
because it is just like if that kid gets

355
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,730
the best waves in the heat and Kelly 
accidentally falls,

356
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,050
he loses,
you know,

357
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:17,300
like that's just the way it is.
Where like if I was playing,

358
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,590
you know,
Lebron James a thousand games in a row,

359
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,480
I'm never going to win.
Never gonna win.

360
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,240
It's impossible.
Um,

361
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,380
but I mean surf competitions,
cool that I,

362
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:28,214
I've surfing it just as a lifestyle as 
like a way to stay sane and have peace 

363
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,260
in your life and meet friends.
That's what surfing is about.

364
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,000
Servings.
Fucking awesome for that.

365
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,640
Do you think you appreciate it more now 
that you're not competing?

366
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,640
Yeah,
I do because I don't see it as,

367
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:44,474
it's my,
My,

368
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,433
my surfing to me is tied to like only 
happiness and only like surfing with my 

369
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:55,400
son and his friends and surfing with my 
daughter and going to the beach and,

370
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:56,234
and traveling to get epic waves.
It's not about like pressure and points 

371
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,393
and a world title and sponsors putting 
pressure on me and my me putting 

372
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:06,780
pressure on myself that basically like 
the,

373
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,550
the,
the,

374
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,760
the,
the pressure part of surfing has gone,

375
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,400
which is amazing,
you know,

376
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,443
I still put the pressure on myself to 
serve at a high level and perform at a 

377
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:19,410
high level to myself.
Um,

378
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,120
and,
and you know,

379
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,420
and be able to,
you know,

380
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,130
have having a game still for sure.
I love that.

381
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:25,964
I love the,
I love the performance aspect of 

382
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,873
surfing,
but the actual competition part is gone 

383
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,270
for me.

384
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,103
It's so cool though that you kept the 
love of it after the competition was 

385
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:39,260
gone because one of the things that 
happens to some,

386
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,130
what definitely happens to fighters,
they retire and they get fat.

387
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,990
They don't want to work out anymore 
because the working out was so torturous

388
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,150
and it felt so much like work that after
it's over,

389
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,163
whatever love they had for martial arts 
sort of goes out the window and they 

390
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,570
start putting on weight.
They don't want to.

391
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,443
They don't want to train anymore,
but you even after the competition was 

392
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:01,070
over,
you kept the love.

393
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,240
Yeah.
I just.

394
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,573
Surfing is this unique thing.
I don't know how you can fall out of 

395
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,520
love with surfing.
Surfing,

396
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,670
surfing.
I.

397
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,503
When I'm in the front of the moment,
I stood on a surfboard and rubbed my 

398
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,560
first wave.
I knew that was out.

399
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,240
That was who I was in my DNA.

400
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,550
Wow.
Like pure and simple.

401
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,630
This is.
This is why.

402
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,640
This is who I am.
First wave,

403
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,040
my yoga teachers become obsessed with 
DNA,

404
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,933
with the DNA.
My Yoga teacher's been become obsessed 

405
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:28,400
with surfing all over instagram now is 
just surfing.

406
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,263
She just surfs everyday and it's so 
weird not to nowhere and like 35 years 

407
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:35,240
old.
She found surfing surfing's weird thing,

408
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,850
but it takes takes.
It's,

409
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,310
it's A.
There's not very many things that are,

410
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,520
that are really similar to surfing in 
that way where you can fall in love with

411
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,130
it being five years old or 80 years old.
Well,

412
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,890
I would think being a yoga teacher too,
she's got incredible balance,

413
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,843
right?
Like having balanced probably really 

414
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,260
help your ability to pick that up.
You know,

415
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,050
what's cool about surfing is it's,
is it's a,

416
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,210
you know,
like if I,

417
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,853
if I,
uh,

418
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,693
let's see if I,
if I take 100 people and said all you 

419
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,380
guys are gonna learn how to drive a race
car and you had like a six week course,

420
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,393
just pure race car driving hundred.
The 100 of those people are going to 

421
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,143
become really good at driving cars and 
going super fast and racing and they'll 

422
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,090
how this really accelerated learning 
curve and get pretty damn good at it.

423
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,160
Snowboarding,
Yoga,

424
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,740
like almost anything surfing.
I like,

425
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,150
I know people who have been serving for 
three decades and they suck.

426
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,950
I'm serious.
What is it?

427
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,640
They've never gotten a tube like in the 
two.

428
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,490
That's like the,
that's like the Holy Grail of surfing,

429
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:44,491
like writing inside the waves,
like right in the center of it surfing's

430
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,140
fricking hard,
man.

431
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,760
It's like,
it has.

432
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,770
It's like,
um,

433
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,790
I don't know.
It's,

434
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,953
it's uh,
but it doesn't mean you have to be good 

435
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:55,140
to enjoy it.
Surfing's awesome.

436
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:57,180
No matter what level you're at.
And that's the beauty of surfing.

437
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,630
But surfing is hard to do,
man.

438
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,473
It's really hard to get good at.
So that's why you get people with 

439
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:02,940
surfing,
you know,

440
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,774
five years and they're pretty good and 
there's people who sort of 50 years and 

441
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,650
they've never been good.
But what is,

442
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,080
what is it is a balance issue.
Is it,

443
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,810
um,
ability to adjust your,

444
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,660
your ability to correct while things are
happening.

445
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:19,430
Like what is it?
I think a lot of is body awareness and,

446
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,543
and,
and is adapting to something that's 

447
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:22,590
changing all the time.

448
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,420
Like say it's like,
you know,

449
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,230
say for instance like basketball did 
know the hoops,

450
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,310
they're the basketballs in your hands.
It's the elements never changed.

451
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,150
There's no variables really besides some
dude tried to block it or,

452
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,750
or golf.
You've got the club,

453
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:37,800
you got the ball,
he got the whole,

454
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,800
but with with surfing,
you got your board and you got you,

455
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,030
but that waves never the same.
There's literally never want to waves,

456
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,270
not the same to any others in the world,
and so every single time you're adapting

457
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,460
to things that are changing in the real,
in real time,

458
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,563
like up to the millisecond,
the waves changing shape as you're 

459
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,074
writing insecure,
so you're never like reacting to 

460
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:57,954
something that is going to stay put.
You're like anticipating the wave 

461
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:04,080
changing shape and that's what you're 
going to like.

462
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:04,914
I'm going to do a bottom turn into a big
turn on aerial maneuver or whatever it 

463
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:08,724
is,
but you're not reacting to something 

464
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,020
that's happening now.

465
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,510
You're reacting to the future.
Does that make sense?

466
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,560
Yeah,
it does make sense.

467
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,143
Now,
if I was a guy who had been surfing for 

468
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:20,540
30 years and I sucked and I was friends,
we would still love it still.

469
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,930
Yeah,
surfing's awesome.

470
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,360
You can be the biggest Kook in the world
and have the most fun.

471
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,180
That's why surfing's is that when 
someone who sucks,

472
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,120
what's called a Kook?
No,

473
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm a quick look.
Who is someone who has,

474
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,950
who has no awareness in the water,
uh,

475
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,860
that's really what a cookie is like,
like if like,

476
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:42,120
if I'm out there surfing and I'm sitting
out there and I'm waiting for a wave and

477
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,020
you paddle out and I've been waiting for
a wave or a long time or some,

478
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,800
some,
some girl,

479
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,100
16

480
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,380
year old girls out there serving and 
she's been waiting for,

481
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,101
you know,
15,

482
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:52,960
20 minutes and you paddle out and you 
paddle,

483
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:53,481
right?
Pastor.

484
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:55,300
And the next way that comes in,
you just turn around and go,

485
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
you're a Kook.
Okay.

486
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:58,114
So that's,
that's if you're unaware of the 

487
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:00,820
situation.
Yeah.

488
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,490
That's just,
that's how people get in fights surfing,

489
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,990
right?
Which is common.

490
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,890
Yeah.
Um,

491
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,670
well a lot of surfers are really into 
Jujitsu.

492
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Probably pretty dangerous to pick a 
fight with a surfer.

493
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,380
Oh yeah.
What does that.

494
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:16,760
One guy's named Joel,
uh,

495
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,590
from Hawaii.
From San Diego with the old tutor.

496
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,080
Yes.
He's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.

497
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,980
He is.
Yeah.

498
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,280
And you would never know it.
He,

499
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,190
yeah,
he looks like so unassuming.

500
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,150
He looks like a guy who fixes computers.
He is,

501
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,560
he's,
and he's a Stoney Bologna.

502
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:36,220
Super Skinny,
hippie cruisy dude,

503
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,230
like stony eyes,
but he'll fuck you up.

504
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,080
He will fuck you up.
But he's cool,

505
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:41,620
man.
He's,

506
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,330
he's awesome.
And he's an incredible surfer,

507
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,080
incredible surfer.
I've seen some footage of him surf,

508
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,400
amazing style and stuff,
but he's,

509
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,263
he's,
um,

510
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,460
he's very unassuming.
Joel,

511
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,990
his Jujitsu is super legit too.
Yeah,

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,460
I've talked to people that have trained 
with him.

513
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,180
He's super legit.
He'll tell you a real quick.

514
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,210
I would imagine that from that 
background,

515
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:05,170
like surfing and that body awareness and
the ability to adjust and change.

516
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:08,890
That's one of the things about Jujitsu 
is like every role is different.

517
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,773
Your,
you have your rolling with different 

518
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:11,494
people,
different size people and your ability 

519
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:16,120
to adjust and change is always changing.
There's always movement.

520
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,690
So he's exactly right.
Adapt that weirdness of the movement.

521
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:20,524
So Jujitsu and surfing or you know,
they totally have their similarities 

522
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:23,404
because you're,
you're sort of anticipating the guys 

523
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:25,564
next move,
which is very similar to surfing on the 

524
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,430
wave,
you know,

525
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,520
reacting to what that guys going to do 
in the future.

526
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,960
Not to what happening.
Right.

527
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:33,250
That very second,
right?

528
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,084
A lot of times if I was a guy that had 
been surfing for 30 years and I sucked 

529
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,250
and I knew you,
I'd be like,

530
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,330
Hey Shane,
Dorian,

531
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,780
what the fuck am I doing wrong?
How do I fix this?

532
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,270
Yeah.
I don't know.

533
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,020
Is there fixing servings?
Not like golf where you,

534
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,430
where you need to get better all the 
time.

535
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,120
Hmm.
You know what I'm saying?

536
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,050
Like,
like,

537
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,050
like if you can enjoy it even if you 
suck,

538
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,200
is that what you mean?
Like if you're a golfer and you and your

539
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,103
[inaudible] I'm not a golfer,
but if you're a golfer and your average 

540
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,720
game is like an 82,
and I said,

541
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:05,554
Joe,
if you buy this putter for a thousand 

542
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,530
dollars,
your average score will be an 80.

543
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,113
You're going to buy that,
that putter because it's the freaking 

544
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,600
world to you to shave two strokes off 
your game.

545
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,580
That's the biggest thing in the world to
improve.

546
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,983
No one gives a shit if they're slightly 
better at surfing is all you care about 

547
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:22,744
is like the is like waking up at the 
crack of dawn and having your coffee 

548
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,343
cruise down to the beach,
seeing the waves and reading the tides 

549
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:31,690
and the wind and the and like going 
surfing with your buddies and having fun

550
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,320
and then you go get breakfast and get 
some breakfast tacos and go to work.

551
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,850
That's the lifestyle is like keeps 
people sane.

552
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,703
That's why they do it.
They don't do it to get better or surf 

553
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,000
super good at or go really fast and that
stuff's fun.

554
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:48,001
But I mean I don't have any more fun 
than a guy who serves.

555
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,840
Have as good as me.
We have the same run,

556
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,680
but I bet he wishes he could surf as 
good as you.

557
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,670
Yeah,
for sure.

558
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,683
So,
and I wish I served as good as the best 

559
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:00,110
stuff on earth,
but it doesn't make it more fun,

560
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:00,944
which is,
that's,

561
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,410
that's why I love surfing.
That's so cool.

562
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,990
That's fascinating.
So what does it make it more?

563
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,960
If you want to get better at it,
if it doesn't make it more fun,

564
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,420
what does it make it more?
It does something.

565
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,533
It doesn't make it more fun.
Does it make it more satisfying if 

566
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:17,210
you're better at it,
like when you surf at a high level,

567
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,403
which is important to you,
now it gives you more options because 

568
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,120
the waves get big.
Right?

569
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,113
Which makes it more fun.
So it's really difficult to surf really 

570
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:26,900
big waves with,
with really low ability.

571
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,823
Right?
So when the waves get big and really 

572
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,404
heavy and technical,
you can't go out there and unless you 

573
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,340
have really good ability to level like 
in,

574
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,750
unless you have a high ability level,
you really can't perform in really great

575
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,920
great conditions.

576
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,963
Right?
So like when you see the crazy 

577
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:47,900
conditions were that you guys get towed 
out and you ride those 80 foot waves,

578
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,660
that shit.
No one who's goofy's doing that?

579
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,213
There's some goofy guys doing that 
because you're using machines to tell 

580
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,010
you in the waves.
Is that you?

581
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,250
Jesus.
Shane.

582
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,370
Oh fuck.
That just gives me such anxiety watching

583
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:02,570
this.
How big is that wave?

584
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,740
Uh,
I dunno.

585
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,370
Probably Sixty feet on the face of 
start.

586
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,000
Damn son.
Oh,

587
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,860
what does that feel like right there 
when it's over.

588
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,030
This part's cool.
Watch.

589
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,680
I get air on the way down.
Oh my God.

590
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,330
See my board because completely an error
right there.

591
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,650
Do you are so high.
That is so high.

592
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,993
Is so giant.
It's like 40 feet above your head right 

593
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,590
now.
Oh my God.

594
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,660
This gives me anxiety.
You know what's cool about surfing is in

595
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,494
those moments,
like there's very few things in the 

596
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:34,970
world other than like,
I don't know.

597
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,250
I don't know how to relate that,
but I'm like,

598
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:41,930
that moment right there for me was like 
the pinnacle of like who I am,

599
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,230
what I do best.
That moment,

600
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:47,870
that wave coming in at that,
at that minute in my life where I was in

601
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,320
a right square foot of the ocean,
when that wave came in,

602
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,630
that was Beth.
That was one of the best days in history

603
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,430
at that of spot.
Wow.

604
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,630
Um,
and I was there.

605
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:57,710
I was prepared.
I was healthy.

606
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,030
Have the right board,
the right equipment,

607
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:00,740
the right energy level.
I wasn't sick.

608
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,360
I didn't have any,
you know,

609
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,823
everything was just lined up and the 
waves are lined up and the swell was 

610
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:06,674
lined up and the wind was line up and 
the tide was lined up and I was in a 

611
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:11,360
perfect spot when that wave came in.
Do you watch the video all the time?

612
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,310
No,
but every time I do,

613
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:16,010
I remember all those things because it 
seems so much so,

614
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,873
so much luck had to do with it.
It's just like a line in the stars 

615
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:20,174
aligning.
That almost seems like something I'd 

616
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,520
want to watch every day.
Like,

617
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,050
get,
get the day going.

618
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
You know,
your first kiss from a girl.

619
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,760
That's what that is.
Wow.

620
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,590
That like mind blown.
Whoa,

621
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,543
this is,
this is like an important moment in my 

622
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:37,730
life and I need to like have this moment
in time frozen.

623
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:40,610
That's what that is right there.
And so I think as an adult,

624
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,410
you very rarely have those moments left.
I mean,

625
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:43,990
I

626
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,150
really like mind expanding mind 
exploding moments where you're like,

627
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:51,300
Holy Shit,
this is life 100 percent life right now,

628
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,120
and that's,
that's what I think we're all chasing.

629
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:54,954
You know what I mean?
Those people sitting in traffic outside 

630
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:58,410
right now driving on the freeway,
they're not having those moments.

631
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,980
Not right then.
That's a real problem.

632
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,023
Yeah.
That's a real problem with life is that 

633
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,610
people aren't having enough of those 
moments

634
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,443
and when you're a 75 yards away from 
that elc a few weeks ago and you had an 

635
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,473
hour to to really think about what 
you're doing and where you were in your 

636
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:18,581
life and how you know how you got to 75 
yards away from this animal to the whole

637
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,143
year of practicing on the target and all
the millions of arrows you shot and all 

638
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:23,954
the preparation that isn't in this thing
stands up and time's ticking and that 

639
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:32,930
moment is there for the taking and it's 
so easy to fuck up and it.

640
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,290
It all happens the way that you.
You hope to visualize it.

641
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,100
Those moments don't happen very often,
man.

642
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,503
No they don't,
and that is what would a lot of people 

643
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:46,990
like yourself or myself or chasing,
you're always chasing these,

644
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,380
these above average moments,
these high level moments,

645
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:55,060
these moments where it just.
Everything's elevated.

646
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,273
Yeah,
like when you're drawn back on a big 

647
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:00,430
elk,
there's not another thing in your mind.

648
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,453
There's nothing on your mind other than 
your shot execution and getting it done 

649
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:07,570
and everything's heightened and all this
pressure around you.

650
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,553
Some guys shake,
like I've seen some guys drawn back on 

651
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:13,900
an animal and that their arms are 
shaking like they're shaking.

652
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,780
Yeah.
Like did you see it in everything?

653
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,030
So much anticipation that could barely 
keep it together.

654
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,410
I mean,
that's what target panic is,

655
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:23,010
right?
It's like there's all this freak out.

656
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,210
Just different.
You know,

657
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,030
there's,
there's

658
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,380
a lot of different levels.
Yeah.

659
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,970
Well I've seen guys do that where they 
had a perfect shot opportunity,

660
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:31,923
animal standing 20 yards away.
Broadside exactly what you pray for and 

661
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:37,930
they get into the shakes and you have to
let down,

662
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,490
let down.
Wow.

663
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,480
Didn't even take a bad shot.
They'd let down and just got.

664
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,420
I can't do it.
Just too much anxiety.

665
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,140
It's probably better than shooting.
Oh,

666
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,280
that's much better.
Yeah,

667
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,150
for sure.
Smart.

668
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,850
Yeah,
that's,

669
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,460
that's,
that's an aware person.

670
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,720
Yeah,
it is.

671
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,530
But I mean,
I think human beings are meant to have a

672
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:55,364
lot of those kinds of experiences.
Those experiences make life richer and 

673
00:28:58,221 --> 00:28:59,560
more satisfying.
Yeah.

674
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,613
You know what I mean?
Sounds like two people who love animals 

675
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:02,901
like,
oh,

676
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:03,734
you piece of shit.
You want to kill an animal that makes 

677
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:07,960
life better.
It's not that like you're,

678
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,090
you're eating meat no matter what.
I feel better when I eat meat.

679
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,163
I believe it's healthier.
Have had these discussions with 

680
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:17,840
nutritionists and scientists and I just 
think it's better for you.

681
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,733
I really do.
And for me to get it that way is way 

682
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:22,514
better because I'm getting my meat along
with this insane hobby that's super 

683
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:28,814
difficult to do.
I mean I could go out and just shoot a 

684
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:31,304
bunch of pigs with a rifle and I could 
get my meat that way and it would still 

685
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:35,720
be fun.

686
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,700
It would still be thrilling.
It would still be ethical.

687
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,060
Wouldn't be the same though.
Is it not the same experience?

688
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,280
No.
I mean,

689
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,114
do you,
do you,

690
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,100
do you want 100 percent?
Just for meat.

691
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,950
You can get me to the store.
Like the experience of that,

692
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,900
of those moments out there with your 
friends and the under the pressure and,

693
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:51,790
and,
and,

694
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,880
and just putting yourself in that 
position where you like,

695
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,720
you need to make it count.
That's right.

696
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:57,554
That's part of our human existence.
That's part of what makes life worth 

697
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:03,040
living is,
is his habit.

698
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,480
Having to,
I don't even know,

699
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:09,481
but just were like,
you know,

700
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,423
um,

701
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,493
I don't know,

702
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,430
but yeah,
I know what you mean.

703
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,473
You can get me to the store,
but you can get wild elk at the store 

704
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,923
and you can't get it that way.
There's just such a giant difference 

705
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,810
between your relationship with the meat 
that you're eating.

706
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,990
When I take an elk steak out of the 
freezer and defrost it and I season it,

707
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,490
your food looks amazing by the way.
Like really,

708
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:34,670
really good at it.
Yeah.

709
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,583
They are getting good at it.
The week after you were in an elk camp 

710
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:40,510
and Utah,
we were there with Chad Ward,

711
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,330
a whiskey whiskey bent barbecue on 
instagram.

712
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,290
Who's a master chef.
He's a fucking wizard.

713
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,960
He's a pitmaster winds like those world 
championships.

714
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,510
And he taught me how to cook it 
properly.

715
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,710
That was awesome.
And you know,

716
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:54,544
it's all about doing it slow and then 
searing it afterwards and you just 

717
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,800
maintain all the people threw that up.

718
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,350
Everybody.
Yeah.

719
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,253
Even one of the guides,
one of the guides was talking to me 

720
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,440
about,
you know,

721
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,210
who said wild game is kind of tough.
And we're like,

722
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:08,650
well how are you cooking?
It was like,

723
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:09,880
well I'll just throw it on the grill.
Like,

724
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:10,960
okay,
you can't do that.

725
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,420
You can't just do it on high heat,
high heat.

726
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,550
Basically sear it and then serve it.
This is not Sashimi,

727
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,820
right?
Well you can if you do it real thin,

728
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,770
slice it crazy thin.
Yeah.

729
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,870
You can click.
It's not bad,

730
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,600
but it's way better if you do a low and 
slow.

731
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,220
I've brought it down to 2:25
now I like to cook it at 2:25.

732
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,140
Yeah,
I just set it at 2:25

733
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:36,090
and I'll,
I'll cook a,

734
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,510
an elk steak for fucking an hour,
you know,

735
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,900
whatever.
It's a trigger.

736
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,280
Yeah.
Because you.

737
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:43,114
If you set a trigger to 25 users setting
called super smoke and so just fills 

738
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:47,914
that,
the inside of those things are so good 

739
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:50,524
for wild game.

740
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,940
It really fast it.
Yeah,

741
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,893
it's all just.
The beautiful thing about them is the 

742
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:55,840
people don't know what we're talking 
about.

743
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,703
A trigger is a pellet grill and these 
pellet grills like this tables made out 

744
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,210
of Oak,
right?

745
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,043
When they cut this table,
they would take the sawdust from this 

746
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:08,570
table and they compress it and just 
using the natural sugars in the woods.

747
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:12,100
They create these pellets and then these
pellet grills,

748
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,653
they have these,
a worm drives that feed these pellets 

749
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:18,220
into a heating element and the heating 
element,

750
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,083
it just,
it just gets hot and then fire and then 

751
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,383
a fan blows in the fire to keep the fire
going and it's all computer controlled 

752
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:29,090
so it calculates exact same temperature 
and it maintains that temperature.

753
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,150
It's so good,
but it's just so pure.

754
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,450
It's just wood and fire.
No Gas,

755
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,990
no.
No chemicals like on charcoal briquettes

756
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:40,210
or no bullshit,
so it tastes so good off the things.

757
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,953
Every time I.
Every time I have people over at my 

758
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,750
house and I cook wild game on my 
trigger,

759
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,820
I have these people like,
what the hell I need to get one of these

760
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:48,290
things.
I've made lots of sold like a million of

761
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:51,410
them right now.
Once you learn how to cook with them and

762
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,100
learn how to do it correctly,
they have those little ones.

763
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,510
Especially wild game.
Wild game is really easy to screw up and

764
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:57,344
it's really hard to screw it up on a 
trigger really because of the fact that 

765
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:01,450
it doesn't have much fat in it.
Yeah,

766
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,490
it doesn't dry it out.
Doesn't cook out though.

767
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,583
You know the moisture and the right.
Do you take yours afterwards and set it 

768
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:11,000
in a cooler to let it rest?
I don't do that.

769
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:12,830
That's next level.
Is it excellent.

770
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,060
I'm getting gems here.
Gold.

771
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,120
This is from Dudley.

772
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,643
He does is.
He'll sear it and then he'll cover it 

773
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:24,470
with aluminum foil and put it in a 
trigger or put it in a Yeti.

774
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:25,304
Rather.
Put it in a cooler clothes seal that 

775
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:27,794
cooler up for like 10 minutes.
And what's in the cooler besides the 

776
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,070
meat?
Nothing.

777
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,540
There's no like a little like ice 
packard and like that'd be nice.

778
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,413
You don't want to just let it sit.
It's actually still cooking so I let it 

779
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,260
sit.
I let it sit,

780
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,810
but I don't,
I don't wrap it up.

781
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,510
And if you wrap it in aluminum foil and 
then let it sit inside the cooler,

782
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:48,050
the cooler actually allows it to 
continue coaching just a little bit.

783
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,913
Okay.
So how many degrees do you take it out 

784
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,020
before?
One 15.

785
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,913
I like to take it out at 1:15.
Then I see her the outside of it and 

786
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:55,094
then I seal it up with aluminum foil and
then I put it in the Yeti and I let it 

787
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,560
sit in that Yeti for 10 minutes.

788
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,190
So it's continuing to slowly,
slowly.

789
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:06,890
Because if you take something warm and 
you put it in the Yeti,

790
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,140
it'll keep it warm.
Yeah.

791
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,253
If you take something called it just 
insulate and incredibly fantastically 

792
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,490
insulated.
And so it works with heat or with cold.

793
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,231
All right.
All right.

794
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,370
All right.
I'm going to try it.

795
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,170
I talked to Doug,
he's the wizard at this stuff,

796
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,263
you know,
I mean,

797
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,210
and he's constantly cooking wild game.
He essentially,

798
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,260
that's all he does.
A good cook.

799
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,380
So very good cook.
Yeah.

800
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,230
Have you ever been to.
It should be.

801
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,740
She freaking does a lot of hunting.
He better be doing a to cook and to.

802
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,663
Yeah,
he just drove all the way from Oklahoma 

803
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,870
to Kansas.
He,

804
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,320
he shot a deer in Kansas,
drove from or not Kansas,

805
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:41,270
Oklahoma.
Shot a deer in Oklahoma,

806
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:46,070
drove all through the night in Oklahoma 
and parked his truck and got into a,

807
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:48,110
a blind in Iowa.

808
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,400
I mean,
he just lives it and he's hard core.

809
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,770
He's as hardcore as you get.
Yeah,

810
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,440
but that's all he eats.
I mean he's,

811
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,453
he's constantly eating deer and cooking 
deer and he loves cooking for other 

812
00:34:58,731 --> 00:34:59,564
people are like large groups of friends 
and family and he's always cooking and 

813
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:03,560
entertaining.
I,

814
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,850
I,
I love that about him.

815
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,450
Like when he cooked for 10 of us.
Yeah.

816
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:11,210
That was awesome.
Incredible meals and everything was well

817
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:12,470
games.
It's frigging awesome.

818
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,850
That Lanai trip,
man,

819
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,420
I look forward to that every year.
It's like a highlight of my year,

820
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,490
you know,
what are we doing it this year?

821
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,140
I know,
right?

822
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,973
We got to talk with you.
GotTa.

823
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,213
You gotta talk dates.
We've got to figure out the dates 

824
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,790
because that last year was so amazing to
have everybody down there and you know,

825
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,290
everybody is such a good crew.
So fucking cool.

826
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,120
You know,
green tree and cam and.

827
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,280
Yeah,
it's just awesome.

828
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,173
And then the first,
first year we invented the cat lady 

829
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:37,574
drink.
Yeah.

830
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,020
That

831
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,870
one.
Yeah.

832
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,363
That was ridiculous.
I think Dudley might be still drinking 

833
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:45,630
it.
I don't think anybody else has died off.

834
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,240
Red Bull and wine.
And what was it?

835
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:51,530
Tequila.
That was the lab a little bit ambitious.

836
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:55,140
So that was a fucking nasty because it 
definitely was a deadly concoction.

837
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,100
Yeah,
he was already hammered.

838
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,800
He was just rated my mini bar.
Just take whatever's in.

839
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,240
There is like a mad scientist at 
liquors,

840
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,970
isn't he?
He's not afraid.

841
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,260
That was such a fun podcast.
So we're all just enjoy it.

842
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,123
It's something about Lanai to where you 
can hunt in paradise and it's such a 

843
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:15,000
small island.
It's like you'd use,

844
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,610
there's not very many people there.
The whole island,

845
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,473
last 3000 humans and shitload a deer.
It's crazy around every Bush scene it 

846
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,440
seems like sometimes.
Yeah,

847
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,070
that's a great thing is it's so easy to 
screw up hunting those access deer,

848
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,913
especially with a bow that it's so neat 
to go and like find your Arrow and then 

849
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,703
you know,
five minutes later you got a whole 

850
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:34,530
nother group of stock.

851
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,821
That's awesome.
Well,

852
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:36,654
it's also the most ethical form of 
hunting because they literally need to 

853
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:40,950
be hunted.
They have to be.

854
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,290
They don't have any predators.
It's a.

855
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,220
and it's not something that some person 
who was a greedy person said,

856
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,054
oh,
I'm going to put all these deer in the 

857
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:49,500
silent.
Then I'm going to go hunt them.

858
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,743
Now they were brought there for a gift 
for King Kamehameha in the 18 hundreds 

859
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,733
and it doesn't take a wildlife biologist
to tell you that the numbers will get 

860
00:36:58,471 --> 00:36:59,900
out of hand if you don't hunt them.
Yeah.

861
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,500
Like when you're there,
it's really obvious.

862
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,290
That's a perfect example of,
of,

863
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,900
of how somewhere needs to be managed.
Yeah,

864
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,883
and I know those guys on Maui have that 
project going on where they're hunting 

865
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:13,490
deer and then giving the meat to poor 
people,

866
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,840
which is the best meat in the world.

867
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,673
I mean it's such an accident right here 
is so delicious and that's a great 

868
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:22,230
program.
It's a fantastic program.

869
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,750
What is the name of that?
It's got some.

870
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,163
That's a.
that's Jake Muse and like a Hickey knew 

871
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,500
he project.
Yeah,

872
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:31,470
that's the name he knew he project.
See you're from Hawaii.

873
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:35,550
You can spit those words out my mouth.
Yeah,

874
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,983
it's funny.
It's a.

875
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,580
You should have jake on the show.
He's,

876
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,443
he's a,
he's a really good dude and he's got 

877
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:41,214
some great stories and he's really well 
educated and knows this business really 

878
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:45,300
well.
So he started meat company.

879
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,630
Yeah.
So he does eradication in Hawaii because

880
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:50,470
it needs to be done and needs to be 
managed.

881
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:51,570
So.
And they're on Maui.

882
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,740
Yeah.
And so he,

883
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,120
you know,
he wanted to,

884
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,760
you know,
to be able to actually utilize that meat

885
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:57,511
because he,
you know,

886
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,160
these big ranches and golf courses and 
stuff,

887
00:37:59,161 --> 00:37:59,994
they,
they actually pay him to come in there 

888
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,614
and do it and so he actually flipped it 
and figured out a way to start a neat 

889
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:06,000
company.

890
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,833
So it's like a win win situation because
the deer need to be managed and you 

891
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:10,664
know,
he's feeding people and then the Kikino 

892
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,543
he projects totally different.
Like he doesn't have a meat company for 

893
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:14,784
that,
but he's able to harvest the animals in 

894
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:17,664
a really good way and then he's able to 
utilize that meet by giving it to 

895
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,410
families who need it.
Simple as that.

896
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,680
It's just phenomenal.
And it's great.

897
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,733
Again,
it's meat that people would pay a 

898
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:30,210
shitload of money for.
It would be like if,

899
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,133
if,
if you could buy commercially raised 

900
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,220
access dear,
it would be one of the prized meets

901
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,880
because it's such an unusual flavor.
It's extremely delicious.

902
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:42,430
And people that don't like wild game and
they were like,

903
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,273
oh,
I'm not really into Venice and I would 

904
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,550
like to cook access to care for them.
I'd be like,

905
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:48,740
just let me cook this for you and tell 
me what you think because I've cooked it

906
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:49,574
for like,
I cooked it from my mother in law and 

907
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,280
she,
she was,

908
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,620
she like took one bite of it and raise 
her eyebrows.

909
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:54,790
And she goes,
what is this?

910
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,620
I'm like,
it's access dear.

911
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,360
She's like,
what kind of direction?

912
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,590
I hadn't showed her a picture of it.
She says,

913
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:02,290
if this is unbelievable,
so delicious.

914
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,200
It's cool to baffle somebody with wild 
game.

915
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,120
Yeah,
if you,

916
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,320
if you can cook it right.
Especially access drgs.

917
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,750
That's incredible.
And how beautiful they are.

918
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,300
They just in general walking around and 
then we'd get one.

919
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,930
They're like,
I don't know.

920
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,020
It's just incredible animals.
I think they're my favorite.

921
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,590
The favorite to hunt?
Yeah.

922
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,713
Well what I like about them is we 
generally go on this access to your 

923
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:24,580
haunt like a couple of months for elk 
season.

924
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,580
So you get all the jitters out of the 
way because they are,

925
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,290
they are like seven times faster than 
you think.

926
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:36,160
An animal that size can be like when 
they move you like how did you,

927
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,880
how did it even do that?
Like how does something move that fast?

928
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:40,714
It's that didn't straighten matrix,
straight matrix and the access to 

929
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,543
arrows.
I'm probably going to Piss some people 

930
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,890
off by saying this,
but the axis deer in Hawaii or different

931
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,490
axis deer in Hawaii or different Benny 
O'bryan when we're on the NIH and he was

932
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:56,590
hunting access to her,
he had.

933
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,570
It was very challenging,
very,

934
00:39:58,571 --> 00:39:59,380
very challenging.

935
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,213
They were ducking arrows and matrices.
Just he was having a hard time and he 

936
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,040
went back to.
He went back home,

937
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,870
back to Texas,
back to the drawing board and said,

938
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:08,351
I got.
I got,

939
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:09,184
I got to go hunting.
He went and hunted access deer first 

940
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,910
morning,
shot a huge buck and he called me.

941
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,900
He goes,
I shot a huge buck,

942
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:15,160
and he goes,
but I got to tell you,

943
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,823
they're fucking different in Texas.
Did the deer just don't react the same 

944
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:21,790
way?
I mean,

945
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,200
in,
in Hawaii,

946
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,660
Hawaiians,
there's no season,

947
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:26,494
they're,
the Hawaiians are eating that meat 365 

948
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,330
days a year.
They're,

949
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:32,720
they're hunting them with high powered 
rifles all year long.

950
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,900
My Maui,
Molokai,

951
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,530
Ella and I,
and uh,

952
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:38,290
those deer are,
they just react like crazy.

953
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,830
Yeah.
They're living in hell every day.

954
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,940
The Paradise,
but living in paradise,

955
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:43,600
it's also a hell.

956
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,130
Every day they're getting shot at.
There's,

957
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,870
there's a good reason they're paranoid.
Yeah.

958
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,810
I mean,
Dan said in Texas,

959
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:51,670
they were just like head down feeding 
children.

960
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,590
They had no idea.
He was like,

961
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:54,550
dude,
it's like a different breed.

962
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,650
But he was also there during the Rut to 
get a little bit more relaxed during the

963
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:00,251
rough.
Sure.

964
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,710
They're switched on in Texas,
but in,

965
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,821
in,
in Hawaii,

966
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:04,654
they're hyper switched on.
If anybody ever wanted to understand 

967
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:10,030
human biology,
like male versus female biology,

968
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,800
they should see deer and elk in the Rut.
Yup.

969
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,330
To see animals in the Rut that normally 
would be super spooky,

970
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,250
afraid of everything jumping at every 
snap twig and they just walking right up

971
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,084
to people like they don't know what's 
going on there in a horny for you get 

972
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,063
you ever see that video of the guy who 
taps the deer on the antlers with as 

973
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,350
well as Arrow?
He's got an arrow and this deer in front

974
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:33,800
of him.
He just tapped on the antlers.

975
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,913
The deer is like,
what?

976
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,890
Yeah,
well I think that would ever happen.

977
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:39,170
It wasn't right in the meeting season 
once.

978
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,363
Once they get those throbbing boners 
they don't know what the fuck's going 

979
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:43,760
on.
Just wandering around.

980
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,310
I saw an elk actually having sex this 
year.

981
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,230
You ever seen that in real life?
Up Close?

982
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,490
Like not through binoculars.
Yeah.

983
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:53,290
So it was only like 30 yards and it's 
elk and they met.

984
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,780
They get up in mount and then they go 
back one big thrust.

985
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:57,561
Yeah.
I was like,

986
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:59,660
that's how they get down.
Like that's crazy.

987
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,170
That's crazy.
It's literally like our double.

988
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,033
Yes.
And he was so proud of himself and he 

989
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:07,190
got down and he was just like,
Shit.

990
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,000
Yes.
Got that moved on.

991
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:14,350
There was like 20 other 20 other 
calories right there that he had the.

992
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,640
He had the service.
That's ridiculous.

993
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:17,870
Just wandering around.
Yeah,

994
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:21,740
I saw it from about 60 yards out.
It sounds crazy,

995
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:22,730
right?
It's,

996
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,623
it's a fascinating experience to just to
be around them when they're behaving 

997
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:27,854
like that.
They're screaming and yelling at each 

998
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,040
other and,
and running and mating.

999
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,040
It's because it only happens once a year
for those animals.

1000
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:34,830
Oh,
we're gonna.

1001
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,790
See it right here on top.

1002
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,570
It's very climactic.
I would wonder how accurate it is.

1003
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,780
It's got to be here,
man.

1004
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,570
I got to line it up.
Yeah,

1005
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,010
I,
he just didn't align in that up.

1006
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,130
I guess he's lining it up,
but does he really know what he's doing?

1007
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,700
He only does it once every six months or
once every 11 months.

1008
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,670
Let's be frustrating on.
You can see why they'll fight each other

1009
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:03,470
for it.
They run for about a month,

1010
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:05,150
right?
Yeah.

1011
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,810
But how cool is it?
How one bowl,

1012
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,240
if he's a bad ass.
And a good fighter,

1013
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:17,230
he can have like the first bull that I 
actually arrowed with my bow,

1014
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,883
he had a Harem of 45 cows,
one bowl and there was like three 

1015
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:24,674
satellite bulls,
but there was one bowl and he had 45 

1016
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:30,500
cows with him that he was hurting that 
were his girlfriends.

1017
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,050
And they're all basically in heat.

1018
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,190
Yeah.
So they're,

1019
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:36,740
they're like relying on him to service 
all of them.

1020
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:38,600
40th five cows.
And I,

1021
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,493
from what I hear,
there's places where it's like there's 

1022
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:43,820
like one bowl for 80 cows.
It's crazy.

1023
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,100
It's a lot of work.
It's a lot of work.

1024
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,160
It's too exhausting.
You really want like three.

1025
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,020
That's like,
that's like Dan Bilzerian,

1026
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,850
he's like a human bowl boil.
Very similar isn't that is fucking logo.

1027
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,320
Did you have him on your show?
Yeah,

1028
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:00,970
yeah.
Yeah.

1029
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,803
So good.
He's always invited me to parties and 

1030
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,130
I'm like,
listen man,

1031
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,950
I'm married.
I can't go to your fucking pointless.

1032
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,730
Pointless to go to a party of his.
If you're married.

1033
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,950
I think his,
his logo was a bowl.

1034
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,190
Not a bull elk,
but a bowl because it go.

1035
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,360
Is it a goat to go?
Really?

1036
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,380
Yeah,
I think so.

1037
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,040
So yeah,
it does it go.

1038
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,030
It's like who's your move lawn,
right?

1039
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,160
That's what it looks like.
I moved onto the sheet,

1040
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,290
but yeah,
that's a goat I think.

1041
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,150
Hmm.
But uh,

1042
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,890
so is a super random

1043
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
who's the best podcast you've ever had?
Every time I think I have the best 

1044
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,260
podcasts,
we'll have another one that's better.

1045
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,513
I talked to someone that I respect 
recently and they said that the Elan 

1046
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,400
Musk one was the best podcast ever.
It's pretty damn good in history.

1047
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,210
Yeah.
That one is wherever.

1048
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,600
The best podcasts in history.
That's a strong word.

1049
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,370
Best podcasts ever been made.
Well,

1050
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,670
he's such a unique mind mean he just.
So they just,

1051
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,900
he just posted a video of one of the 
boring tunnels,

1052
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:04,340
first a completed tunnels.
And so the.

1053
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,850
Let's see Jamie on.
Yeah,

1054
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,780
it's an insanely long tunnel through La 
and they,

1055
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,790
they've been doing this only for a few 
months,

1056
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,090
but apparently in December they're going
to start doing this.

1057
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:16,260
Like,
look how long this is.

1058
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,630
This is inside La.
I mean this is his actual completed real

1059
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:24,840
tunnel.
That's underneath la right now.

1060
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,240
Kay,
can we talk about how there's no like,

1061
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:27,403
like a,
like a prototype that we heard about is 

1062
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:30,440
like all of a sudden he was just like,
ah,

1063
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,460
how do you get a.
Who owns the land underneath?

1064
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,323
That's a real good question.
I don't think he understood what I was 

1065
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:36,360
asking when I asked him that.
I'm like,

1066
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,890
how do you,
how do you do this?

1067
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:38,724
Like who do you ask to do this?
Like all of a sudden he called my 

1068
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,483
project manager.
I'm like no shit house to make a well 

1069
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,490
and they want to dig under their house 
to make a well and they'd go through the

1070
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:52,410
roof of your tunnel.
Are they allowed to.

1071
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,543
I love that there's humans like him that
are thinking on such a massive scale 

1072
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,430
that are trying to fix the biggest 
problems that humans are facing.

1073
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,540
Guys like you were out there riding 
waves and I'm telling Dick Jokes.

1074
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,080
This guy is digging holes under the 
earth.

1075
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,003
Yeah.
I mean he's also sending cars in the 

1076
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,170
space.
Right?

1077
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,540
He sent his own car.
He shot into space.

1078
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:21,570
He's got space x.
he's talking about colonizing Mars,

1079
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:26,430
he's got a Tesla company that makes the 
best electric cars on the planet earth.

1080
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,683
I mean,
he's got so many different things going 

1081
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:32,370
on simultaneously.
I just don't understand his capacity for

1082
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,210
work.
He's trying,

1083
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,410
he's trying to fix the energy,
you know,

1084
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,620
the energy problem with,
you know,

1085
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,890
you know,
getting energy from,

1086
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:41,803
from the sun to power your house to 
power your car to power cities and you 

1087
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:47,070
know,
it's crazy.

1088
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,933
He makes solar panels now that are 
actually tiles for your roof or your 

1089
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,180
solar roof.
Incredible.

1090
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,610
Like you replaced the tiles on your roof
with these solar time.

1091
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,680
Solar's fricking cool dude.
I just got it on my house.

1092
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,680
I got,
I got it on my house and it and have one

1093
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:02,514
of those tests,
the powerwall two batteries and things 

1094
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,004
insane.
And it's got like this crazy smart 

1095
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:10,230
algorithm that knows when a hurricane's 
coming to Hawaii and it'll like power up

1096
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,300
my,
my battery deal 100 percent.

1097
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,493
Even if I'm not home,
even if I'm not watching the weather 

1098
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,710
channel,
it just does it automatically because it

1099
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:18,910
knows it might need to back up my house.
Wow,

1100
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:19,561
so my,
all,

1101
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:23,190
my elk doesn't go bad in my freezer.
So are you on the grid?

1102
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,033
Are you off the grid on the grid,
but you have the solar power as well as 

1103
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:30,070
a backup power comes from

1104
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:30,923
the,
the solar and you could sell some of it 

1105
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:34,630
back to the grid.
No,

1106
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:36,110
mind you that.
No,

1107
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,993
they used to do that in Hawaii,
but I think they stopped in the power 

1108
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,440
companies weren't down with solar 
really.

1109
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:42,783
It's hard to establish solar.
It's hard to get permits and everything 

1110
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:47,220
to have your house set up.
Like they,

1111
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,880
they try to make it kind of difficult 
for it.

1112
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,620
Try to make it very difficult.
Yeah.

1113
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,800
But I,
it's pretty cool.

1114
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,960
I've,
I've offset my,

1115
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:53,823
my,
my power needs with solar by like 80 

1116
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:56,460
percent.
Wow,

1117
00:47:56,461 --> 00:47:57,294
that's great.
So you could conceivably just exists 

1118
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,120
purely on solar.
Yeah.

1119
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,400
Now you're on the big island.
Yup.

1120
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,270
No wild is fucking crazy.
Volcano Shit is going.

1121
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,680
How's that?
You freaking out about that at all?

1122
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,990
Not freaking out.
I was freaking out.

1123
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,123
Yeah.
So,

1124
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,860
so I live on the west side in Kona.

1125
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,240
The volcanoes on the east side.
So is the east side,

1126
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,610
is that near?
Just south of Hilo.

1127
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,890
Okay.
And that's where the,

1128
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,870
the,
that's where the volcano was,

1129
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:29,410
but the wind like the tradewinds blow 
east to west.

1130
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,500
So.
So where I live,

1131
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,020
it looked like Shanghai for like three 
months.

1132
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,030
The air sucked like crazy.
It was like La smog times 10.

1133
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,000
That freaked me out.
I just pulled up vog bog vogue like.

1134
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:44,420
Yeah,
like,

1135
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,253
like volcanic hayes.
My daughter is severely allergic to 

1136
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:49,204
that.
Really?

1137
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,670
Yeah.
We went to a store on the big island.

1138
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,513
We were staying at the four seasons and 
we left and went down to a store to get 

1139
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:56,944
something for a cell phone.
She came with me and she just starts 

1140
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:02,410
sneezing and sniffling and her eyes were
puffing up.

1141
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:03,220
I'm like,
UK,

1142
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,070
like,
what's going on?

1143
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:04,871
Are you sick?
She's like,

1144
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:05,710
I don't know what's going on.

1145
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,320
And the guy at the counter said,
oh,

1146
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,490
it's probably the vog.
And I said,

1147
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,270
what the fuck is the Vog is volcanic 
smog?

1148
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,260
And it just didn't bother me at all.
But with her,

1149
00:49:17,261 --> 00:49:21,070
she's allergic to cats and a couple 
other things like make her sniffle.

1150
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,900
It was bad for about three months where 
I live.

1151
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,350
It's horrible.
Yeah,

1152
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,440
that's what it looks like.
That's insane.

1153
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,450
That does look like it looks like 
Beijing,

1154
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,800
you know.
And the crazy thing was,

1155
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,743
you know,
like if the,

1156
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,740
if the,
if the wind goes the wrong way,

1157
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:36,930
then like Maui Allahu,
it's all foggy,

1158
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,720
like all throughout Hawaii.
But it was basically like the whole,

1159
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:41,563
uh,
the volcano essentially at a crazy 

1160
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:46,510
eruption for about three and a half 
months.

1161
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,580
Yeah.
And then not digit stopped.

1162
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:50,560
And the air quality is incredible.
Where I live now.

1163
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,490
Real?
Yeah.

1164
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,520
Just so blue off blue skies,
crystal clear,

1165
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:56,410
like just insane.

1166
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,690
Sunset sunrises.
Uh,

1167
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,193
it's just beautiful.
So what did geologists best air quality 

1168
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,340
in 10 years for sure.
Yeah.

1169
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:04,263
Why is that?
I don't know because there was like a 

1170
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:11,110
constant interruption for like 25 years,
but it was just kind of small,

1171
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:11,944
but it was continuously going.
But now it's like nearly shut down 

1172
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:16,204
completely.
So there's hardly any kind of anything 

1173
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:20,410
going in the air.
So the volcano blew its load.

1174
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,780
Did kinda like that elk?
Yeah.

1175
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:24,721
Bang.
It was.

1176
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:25,554
It was.
It was lining us up for awhile and just 

1177
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,270
big old bank.
So the Vog is gone.

1178
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,130
So now it's probably a good time to go 
there.

1179
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,750
It's a very good time.
Wow.

1180
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,640
Come over and visit.
Does it fuck with the.

1181
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,400
That's why I texted you and said come 
over and hunt.

1182
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:38,933
We're going hunting.
I ain't getting hit in the head by a 

1183
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:41,240
giant chunk of lava.

1184
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:43,963
Oh my God.
Dude.

1185
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,270
Did you hear about the fricken boat that
had a big like a lava rock,

1186
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,050
like a boulder lava boulder.
And go through the roof of it.

1187
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:52,730
Yeah.
There's like a spectator boat.

1188
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:53,743
Yeah.
They were a tourist boat watching the 

1189
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:57,230
volcano psycho there.
They were so close.

1190
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,193
Yeah.
Do you have a soda that Jamie that you 

1191
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:00,770
can bring up?
It's nuts.

1192
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,310
These tour boat companies,
if they're.

1193
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,330
They're pretty opportunistic.
You know,

1194
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,343
it's not,
it's not easy to make a living on the 

1195
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:09,134
big island.
And so you get these people that all 

1196
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:14,300
want to go see the eruption.
That all the lava going into the water.

1197
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,363
Oh,
if you can look for a photo of the boat 

1198
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:19,544
near the eruption,
there's some images of these boats that 

1199
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:23,174
were like,
it looked like they were like 50 feet 

1200
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:27,170
away from this mega eruption.
Like crazy.

1201
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:28,943
Really scary stuff.
But you don't have to mess with lava 

1202
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:31,350
man.
Yeah,

1203
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:32,184
and especially when it's spitting things
out as the year before that watches 

1204
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,810
molten rock,
the earth pissed.

1205
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,980
That's when it happened to veer off the 
coast of Hawaii's big island.

1206
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:46,310
Monday.
Well back then a buyer.

1207
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,860
I want to watch it fly through the air 
and hit them and I will think what would

1208
00:51:49,861 --> 00:51:52,770
I do?
Look at it flying into the air.

1209
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:58,180
The time to think about what you would 
do is before you get on the boat.

1210
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,190
Yeah.
Once you're in that boat,

1211
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,780
you're.
You're just locked in.

1212
00:52:01,781 --> 00:52:03,310
Dude.
That's crazy.

1213
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:08,080
The whole on the fucking boat roof,
you see the redness and the whole of the

1214
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:08,914
boat.
Just the hot shit just tore right 

1215
00:52:11,231 --> 00:52:12,340
through the roof.
Well,

1216
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:13,174
and all,
all of these tour boat guys are 

1217
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:17,523
competing right there.
They're like jockeying for position to 

1218
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:20,044
get the closest,
unobstructed view so everyone can take 

1219
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:26,350
videos and posted on their instagram.
Wow,

1220
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,380
but you're 23 people injured.
Okay.

1221
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:32,830
Let's talk about if one of those like 
little like lava nuggets.

1222
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,520
Just having a flight to you just blow 
right through you.

1223
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,220
Yeah.
What if it hit someone in the head?

1224
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,453
How about the guy next to you?
It's headless and you're sitting there 

1225
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,620
with your fucking camera out trying to 
get a selfie for instagram,

1226
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,810
but the thing is that everybody trips 
out and like,

1227
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:48,310
oh my God,
is this unprecedented?

1228
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,143
Is Lava just,
can you believe this lava volcanoes 

1229
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:52,450
happening?
I'm like,

1230
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:54,880
are you kidding me?
We live on an active volcano.

1231
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:55,714
That's where we live.
I born and raised on this island 

1232
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,100
erupting almost every day since I was 
born.

1233
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,391
True,
right?

1234
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:02,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

1235
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,330
Most of your life that is interrupting.
Yup.

1236
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,760
Yeah.
You can go almost anytime of the year,

1237
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:09,900
any year and see lava.
Pretty cool.

1238
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,940
Kona,
because terrence Mckenna used to live in

1239
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:15,720
Kona is is that you don't know who turns
candidate.

1240
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:16,923
He's a very famous psychedelic,
I guess you would call them a 

1241
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,730
psychedelic speaker.
Scholar.

1242
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,073
He's a,
he was a botanist who I'm an 

1243
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:26,700
ethnobotanist

1244
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,360
who set up this place and Kona and uh,
he was,

1245
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,194
uh,
he was off the grid completely off the 

1246
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:34,740
grid.
Like he has Iowasca oh yeah.

1247
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,990
Camp,
everything.

1248
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,660
He,
he,

1249
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,910
he had his,
I don't know what,

1250
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,810
what's going on with his old property,
but I think some of it burnt down.

1251
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,170
There was a fire up there and I think he
lost like,

1252
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:46,711
oh no,
no,

1253
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:49,050
no.
The fire was up in northern California.

1254
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,880
He had some of his books up in northern 
California,

1255
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:51,714
but he has a place up in the big island 
that there was like 30 different types 

1256
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:59,270
of psychedelic plants growing on his,
you know,

1257
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,770
and like 10 acres up there.
That's a spot up there.

1258
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,040
And he had been in that house high as a 
kite or.

1259
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:05,520
Well,
no,

1260
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
I'm friends with his brother.
I would like to go there.

1261
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,950
He's dead now,
unfortunately.

1262
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:10,783
Really?
Yeah.

1263
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,493
Yeah.
It looks like a pretty frequent cosmic 

1264
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:14,730
joint right there.
Well,

1265
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:15,990
that's a weird picture,
right?

1266
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,780
It looks very.
See that picture?

1267
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:19,614
Yeah.
He had a dope place so he would get all 

1268
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,030
his water from the rain.
He would.

1269
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,043
He had like these cisterns,
I guess they would call them what do 

1270
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:27,024
these containers that catch rainwater 
and he had a everything filtered that 

1271
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:31,764
way and say horny hippies a,
there's probably some freaky shit going 

1272
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:37,790
on up there,
late night activities of,

1273
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:42,270
but he was doing a lot of lectures on 
psychedelics and school,

1274
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,193
one of the most influential speakers 
ever on psychedelics because he was so 

1275
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:48,750
interesting.
Such an interesting guy to listen to.

1276
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,300
A lot of people like that really 
gravitate to the big island.

1277
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,353
Yeah.
There's something about the big island 

1278
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:55,050
where we live that has just.
It's alive.

1279
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,120
It really is.
The island is fricking alive.

1280
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,530
It really is.
Yeah,

1281
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,950
and you feel that there's like this,
there's like an energy there and there's

1282
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,780
people who are like,
I'm meant to live here.

1283
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:04,614
I had moved across the earth to live 
here because it's like just pulled me 

1284
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:09,660
here,
meet people like that all the time.

1285
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,290
Did your brick and he's one of those 
guys.

1286
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,520
I mean he's from Colorado.
He was originally from Colorado,

1287
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,893
but I mean for him he was a bit of a 
recluse and he would fly six for six 

1288
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:23,604
months of the year.
He would fly and give these lectures in 

1289
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,710
Austin and San Francisco and all over 
the world really,

1290
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,903
and then he would fly back and live on 
the big island to write books and the 

1291
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:33,803
cool place to live.
Man,

1292
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:34,743
it's awesome.
I love living there and if you're a bow 

1293
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:37,680
hunter,
so in a bad place either.

1294
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:38,160
Right?

1295
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,790
It's not a bad place either.
Why isn't incredible for awning boss?

1296
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:42,624
This is incredible for people.
Everybody's got a really good attitude 

1297
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:46,890
there.
It's like it's more,

1298
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,750
you know,
I just got back from Manhattan,

1299
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,930
which I love a logo in New York City 
and.

1300
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:54,120
But every time I go there I'm like,
I don't think I could do this.

1301
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,960
I don't think I could live here.
It's just two stacked on top of things.

1302
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:01,620
And there was this one thing that I had 
seen there that I'd never seen before.

1303
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,693
They had like this rotating,
rotating machine that you parked cars 

1304
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:06,684
on.
So say if you parked your car in here 

1305
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:09,084
with lift up like this and then your car
would go like up here and then 

1306
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:14,310
underneath there and be like 30 cars 
underneath you.

1307
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,230
I was like,
what the fuck is that?

1308
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,660
I see not in Tokyo.
Crazy dude.

1309
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,510
That's.
And You can rent one of those spots.

1310
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,000
One of those,
one of those car spots for like

1311
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:24,923
huge bucks in Tokyo.
I'm sure like 50 grand a year will 

1312
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:30,340
tougher like for,
for like a parking spot at your building

1313
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:31,870
where you live.
Have you been to Tokyo?

1314
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,450
Yeah.
Lots.

1315
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,720
So condensed.
Yeah.

1316
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,260
Yeah.
It's such a strange.

1317
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,710
It's another Tokyo strange too because 
it's so polite.

1318
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,940
Yeah.
I love Tokyo.

1319
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:40,903
It's like everyone's.
It's almost like you're visiting an 

1320
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:44,530
alien culture because I don't 
understand.

1321
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,513
I don't know what they're writing is.
I see it but I recognize it as Japanese 

1322
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:51,760
but I have no idea what it says.
And then the people there,

1323
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:56,050
they're all like super polite and very 
orderly and then everything's electronic

1324
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:57,910
and it's almost like times square,
like with big,

1325
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:02,800
like this is almost like a,
like a parallel civilization.

1326
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,320
Like on another planet and how the hell 
they get there.

1327
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,243
That's where they ended up.
Like if you look at the history of 

1328
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:09,430
Japan,
it's the opposite of that.

1329
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:10,723
Right?
Right.

1330
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,370
Means true old school,
Japan.

1331
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:16,330
It's the opposite of that.
Like all of a sudden they have like this

1332
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,790
full on,
like forward technology,

1333
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:22,060
hyper futuristic civilization there now.
Yeah.

1334
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:24,160
That's a fascinating thing about Asian 
period,

1335
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:25,960
right?
Like Samsung in Korea,

1336
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:26,794
they make the,
some of the best electronics in the 

1337
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:28,924
world and you drive just outside the 
city and there's like rice fields 

1338
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:31,970
everywhere and people weren't,
you know,

1339
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,333
working with those cool hats on and like
everyone has no shoes and just on their 

1340
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:37,114
new mud.
Then you drive right to the city and 

1341
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:40,720
it's just like this giant electronic 
city.

1342
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,540
Yeah.
Wonder what it is.

1343
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,383
Kind of cool.
Good food though in Japan and all over 

1344
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,150
Asia,
but I love Japan.

1345
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:47,370
Dig It.
No,

1346
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,333
Japan's pretty.
I'm just fascinated by the culture 

1347
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:51,274
period.
I mean that's obviously the birthplace 

1348
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:54,340
of a lot of martial arts.

1349
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:57,220
Judo came from their karate.
A lot of.

1350
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,380
Whoa.
A lot of,

1351
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,373
a lot of.
I'm not the exact thing you want to be 

1352
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,623
spilling into the crack.
I was afraid that we're going to have 

1353
00:58:11,351 --> 00:58:12,184
nothing to talk about that was going to 
be interesting or we get stuck on like 

1354
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,840
our tree for like two hours.
So I looked up a couple of things.

1355
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,850
What did you look up?
I was looking.

1356
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,693
I was geeking out in the car.
Was that impressive when I just pulled 

1357
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:25,390
up in like a big Old Cadillac bug?
A black cadillac with a driver or what?

1358
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,343
No,
it's normal.

1359
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,570
Everybody does.
That was really,

1360
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,900
really weird.
Weird view because you live in Hawaii.

1361
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:32,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

1362
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,020
Don't do that very often.
But when you drive like a Tundra,

1363
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,863
some shit I do.
I drive a Toyota Tundra from big on a 

1364
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,190
Toyota.
Every bloody in Hawaii has a Toyota kill

1365
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:41,780
break.

1366
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,170
This fricken state car.
It's the move,

1367
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,190
right?
They don't break.

1368
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:46,360
They don't break.
They don't.

1369
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:49,880
I've had three lexuses,
Lexus Suv.

1370
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,640
Those fucking things never break down.
They never have a single thing.

1371
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:55,483
Goldwater.
Amazing.

1372
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:56,960
Nothing.
No.

1373
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,050
They're incredible vehicles.
Yeah.

1374
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,290
They just won't.
And,

1375
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,124
and you know in,
in Hawaii you're going off road so much 

1376
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:05,180
that.
Yeah,

1377
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:05,920
I,
I,

1378
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,920
for surfing and hunting,
I'm always going off road and campaign,

1379
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,813
taking my kids and stuff.
So you want something reliable and you 

1380
00:59:11,921 --> 00:59:12,754
can fricking.
You can buy a Toyota truck for like 35 

1381
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:18,730
grand in like six years later.
You sell it for 32.

1382
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:19,783
Yeah.
The resale values nuts and it'll go for 

1383
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:22,760
200,000

1384
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,593
miles.
They're great with zero problems and 

1385
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:25,964
drive a big Tundra.
That's the other thing that Japanese 

1386
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:28,364
figured out how to do.
Like how they figure out how to make 

1387
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:31,160
things.
So God damn reliable.

1388
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,750
Yeah.
You know,

1389
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,280
is that you?
There's my truck.

1390
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,600
Yes.
Look at that.

1391
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,790
Lifted Toyota,
Hawaii.

1392
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:38,683
That's my last truck.
I got the exact same truck now though 

1393
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,653
too.
Good truck.

1394
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,580
Get anywhere you want to go.
Yeah.

1395
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,760
I'm actually sponsored by the local 
dealership where I live.

1396
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,830
Oh really?
Big Island.

1397
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,980
Toyota.
Shout out,

1398
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:49,814
shout out to your Toyota.
We'll get the fender flares and 

1399
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:52,634
everything.
I thing is google drive straight up a 

1400
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:57,620
mountain or a bet it will.
And up hold about 10 deer in the back of

1401
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:00,500
it.
Have you ever seen that company called a

1402
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,740
Dev Rolo?
They take those things.

1403
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,970
They make a bulletproof and they,
they,

1404
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:07,340
uh,
they spray the outside of.

1405
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:07,820
Um,
what,

1406
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,820
what does that fucking coding that makes
some bulletproof?

1407
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,250
I might need to get that for all the 
Peta people.

1408
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,860
Do you get paid?
People don't,

1409
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:20,630
you don't get any hunting and surfing.
You would think that they're both.

1410
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,593
You're actually natural,
but you'd get a little bit of it just 

1411
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:26,510
because there's a lot of Granola crunchy
people that get upset.

1412
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,410
There was a lot of like dolphin writers 
in the surf world that are like,

1413
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,010
you know,
we're from that.

1414
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,270
It's peaceful from the earth.
Why do you got to kill the Shane?

1415
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:38,000
Why you got to kill the.
Why'd you have to kill the animals?

1416
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,350
Man,
let him let him live.

1417
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:41,000
I always get these guys.
Let them live.

1418
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,980
Always,
always,

1419
01:00:42,981 --> 01:00:43,550
always,
always.

1420
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,360
They understand that if you don't kill 
them,

1421
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,360
there's going to be way more problems 
for them.

1422
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:49,570
If you don't,
not only do they not understand it,

1423
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,770
but they're never going to understand 
it.

1424
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,330
No,
that's it.

1425
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,090
I used to consider like trying to 
explain that to people,

1426
01:00:56,091 --> 01:00:56,924
but there's,
there's,

1427
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,750
there's really not because what is,
there's a coating that they,

1428
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:03,000
it's called Polyuria is the,
um,

1429
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,230
is the type of material.
But uh,

1430
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,720
there's a,
there's an actual name for it.

1431
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,560
Uh,
Adam green trees got a really,

1432
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,570
really bad ass Toyota.
Yeah.

1433
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:19,230
Well he had his built his whole back 
area where the cabin is,

1434
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,083
is all like stuff.
He's not just looks though he doesn't 

1435
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:25,430
have like red wheels.
He's got like real shit,

1436
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,264
like frigerators in there and enter 
fricking shower to shower off all the 

1437
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:30,404
mud and we actually drove to his 
property and he was so mudded out that 

1438
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,310
it was impossible to get up the road 
because it's pure mudslide.

1439
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:41,030
And he uses winch to winch us up up his 
road,

1440
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:44,330
like all the way up his road with the 
winch.

1441
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,560
So.
Cool.

1442
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,090
So it's just,
I mean the thing is like bad.

1443
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:48,530
It's actually good for something.
You know,

1444
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:50,960
he's been in America now for like a 
month and a half,

1445
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:51,863
just hunting.
He's been almost getting killed in a 

1446
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,950
tree stand last couple of days.
Hell yeah.

1447
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,710
So he's texting to get the hell out of 
that tree.

1448
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:01,550
If you go to Adam Green trees,
a instagram page,

1449
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,610
there's a video of it where he's in a 
tree stand.

1450
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,940
He's waiting like he's trying to hunt 
deer and he's waiting for a deer to walk

1451
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:08,774
by and he hears guns go off and then he 
hears the leaves crack because bullets 

1452
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:16,820
are whizzing by his head and hitting the
leaves and they literally.

1453
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,920
And there's video of it and he's like,
well,

1454
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:20,070
what?
Fuck mate.

1455
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,080
Because he's fucking as.
Yeah.

1456
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:26,340
He said there was 200,
200 gunshots in six hours.

1457
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,181
Oh yeah.
Where's he?

1458
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:28,014
Kansas?

1459
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,340
Kentucky,
Kentucky,

1460
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,340
Kentucky.
Not a lot of Tundras.

1461
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:35,910
And have you ever been to the Midwest 
during opening day?

1462
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,730
If you drove a Tundra in Kentucky,
it would need to be bulletproof.

1463
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,200
They would shoot at it.
Yeah.

1464
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:44,850
It'd be like fricking Chevrolet man.
They have a lot of toyotas down there.

1465
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:45,511
Do they?
Yeah.

1466
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,344
They given not only that Toyota is 
Toyota trucks are actually made in 

1467
01:02:48,691 --> 01:02:49,680
America.
Believe they are.

1468
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,600
Yeah.
Am I Tundra was made in Texas.

1469
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,800
Yeah,
there you go.

1470
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,510
There there's a lot of toyotas are made 
in America,

1471
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:55,200
you know,
uh,

1472
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,830
the Acura Nsx,
which is a Honda that's actually made in

1473
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:01,070
Ohio.
They construct,

1474
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,390
they designed it and constructed in 
Kentucky.

1475
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,910
There you go.
Holla at your boards.

1476
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,120
So they employ people.
They deal with people.

1477
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,550
That used to be an issue in Detroit.
If you're in Detroit,

1478
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:13,800
you were driving a non American car,
they'd shoot at it.

1479
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,420
But now,
I mean,

1480
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:18,780
so many car companies moved out of 
Detroit selling cars.

1481
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:21,490
They kind of gave up on that line X.
is that the coding?

1482
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:22,290
Yes.
Next.

1483
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,700
Thank you.
That shit.

1484
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,800
You could take a line.
Exit is crazy.

1485
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:26,843
That black coating,
that plastic coating that they put on 

1486
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:32,310
those trucks,
you can take line and cover a watermelon

1487
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:35,610
with it and drop it off of a building.
Bouncing around.

1488
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,830
Yeah.
That's.

1489
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,970
So they take that,
that,

1490
01:03:37,971 --> 01:03:41,910
that matte gray,
matte black sort of cover that they look

1491
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:43,800
sick.
That is a line x.

1492
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,023
and so these line x covered trucks,
they make them and they also make them 

1493
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:52,530
with Kevlar windows and door panels and 
bulletproof plates underneath them.

1494
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:53,364
They make like a.
I feel like just a total piece of shit 

1495
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:56,184
and everybody wants to kill you.
You get one of those things just drive 

1496
01:03:58,821 --> 01:03:59,860
around a lie.

1497
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:00,723
Next armored vehicle.
How much of an idiot do you look like 

1498
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:05,040
driving that thing around?
Pretty bad ass.

1499
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,580
Just were mirrored.
Sunglasses tell to fuck themselves.

1500
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,373
I like the like,
I love the fricking Lynox the whole 

1501
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:16,170
thing.
That's like I'm watching the watermelon.

1502
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,460
Watch this.
Look at this.

1503
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,070
Boom.
That's a watermelon bro.

1504
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,770
Yeah.
I was thinking look at this.

1505
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,290
Bullying.
Well almost like a basketball.

1506
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,153
Yeah.
So any scratches that you would 

1507
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,310
ordinarily get from like branches and 
shit.

1508
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,970
Like I bet you're the kind of travel it.
Look at this.

1509
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,630
It is doing that to my truck.
Do you get scratched up?

1510
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:37,603
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1511
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,520
There you go.
Just like that.

1512
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:39,354
You can just like pressure wash it.
You have to worry about decals coming 

1513
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:42,870
off.
You have to worry about anything.

1514
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:44,520
You just shoot the shit down.
And it's clean.

1515
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:45,773
Yeah.
One of our guides in had his truck was 

1516
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,070
lynette.
It was green.

1517
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,060
Completely.
Yeah.

1518
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:51,751
Yeah.
Yeah.

1519
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:52,890
That's great.
That was Alex.

1520
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,890
it's good stuff.
Yeah.

1521
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,840
Alex love him.
Yeah.

1522
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:55,674
That stuff just doesn't scratch too.
You can go so many key your car and it 

1523
01:04:57,751 --> 01:05:02,751
just fucks up their key.
It's pretty impressive stuff.

1524
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,000
Bunnies that we.
When you,

1525
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,660
when you see trucks like mine here in 
La,

1526
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,580
it funnier one.
Oh,

1527
01:05:08,581 --> 01:05:11,550
there's a lot of them look like bad 
asses.

1528
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,190
This one looked like a killer and a 
lifted truck.

1529
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:16,590
You can't park in any structure.
You just true.

1530
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,870
You can underneath

1531
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,530
like any underground parking attendant.
You look cool.

1532
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:23,090
That's important out here.
You look cool.

1533
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,780
And like gridlock traffic at like 5:00
PM.

1534
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,760
Four.
Oh five.

1535
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,060
Yeah.
But you're above her buddy.

1536
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:33,150
You got to look down on losers.
I got my lifted monster truck.

1537
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,080
Is it a strange thing when you come from
your place?

1538
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,790
I mean,
what is the big one and have 100,000

1539
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,500
people or something like that.
And the entire island.

1540
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,180
It's the biggest island.
All of Hawaiian.

1541
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:44,550
Yeah.
And you know,

1542
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:47,200
you go from there to here where there's 
100,000

1543
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:48,610
people,
you know,

1544
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,610
go to West hills right here.
There's probably 100,000

1545
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:53,680
people for every,
like three blocks.

1546
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,163
It is weird coming here.
I spent a lot of my life in California 

1547
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,510
actually,
even though I was born and raised on the

1548
01:05:58,511 --> 01:05:59,344
big island and every time I get off the 
plane I just so baffling that freaking 

1549
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,743
lax airport and getting on the fricking 
shuttle for the rental car and then 

1550
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,880
getting a rental car and then getting on
the four.

1551
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,900
Oh five.
And everyone's going 90.

1552
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,430
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1553
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,600
There's always an adjustment period of 
like a half an hour.

1554
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,560
So when I'm driving I'm like in the slow
lane,

1555
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:18,394
like why this is really happening 80 
miles an hour and then cost flyby going 

1556
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,430
80 miles an hour and everyone's going 80
and no one's getting stopped.

1557
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:26,470
And I don't know,
it's just a shock.

1558
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,333
Well,
you're used to place where people don't 

1559
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:29,860
even pass people in the highway.
Yeah.

1560
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,410
Lived on those roads.
If someone passes people in those little

1561
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:34,600
single lane roads,
people get mad,

1562
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:35,643
right?
Yeah,

1563
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:36,850
yeah.
We get mad,

1564
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:39,680
they get mad if you're going too fast,
like slow down.

1565
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:41,230
Yeah.
Well the same,

1566
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:41,960
the mainland.
That's,

1567
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,080
that's,
that's whole Hawaii is Hawaii.

1568
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:44,943
Like I think,
I think we were talking about this on 

1569
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:47,914
the,
on the last,

1570
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:51,010
last time I was here,
but Hawaii is just a,

1571
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,050
it's a different kind of place where 
yeah,

1572
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,013
you don't,
you don't pass people just because 

1573
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:58,110
they're going a little bit slower on 
the,

1574
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,033
on the highway and if you do,
you better make sure they're not the 

1575
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:00,844
wrong person.

1576
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:02,300
They're gonna fuck you up.
Yeah.

1577
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:03,134
You to,
you want to show respect to the people 

1578
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:04,930
and,
and uh,

1579
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,440
I,
I,

1580
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,520
you know,
I think there's like a,

1581
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,380
there's like this dynamic in Hawaii 
where,

1582
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:11,830
you know,
I mean everyone who moves there is,

1583
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:13,990
that's fine.
I don't think anyone gets mad at that,

1584
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:14,824
but you just don't want those people to 
move to Hawaii because they love Hawaii 

1585
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:21,700
and then try to turn it into California,
respect their culture,

1586
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,073
the way people act and then respect the,
the vibe that everything is more 

1587
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,080
relaxed.
But that's why it's so cool to visit.

1588
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:29,890
Yeah.
Because you,

1589
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:34,450
you literally feel relaxed when you get 
there because everything's relaxed.

1590
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:36,460
It's a different.
It's a different vibe.

1591
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:37,533
People forget that though.
People move to Hawaii for that and then 

1592
01:07:40,091 --> 01:07:41,860
they moved to.
Didn't want to turn it into California.

1593
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:42,843
Does that happen?
Do you want to buy a big house on the 

1594
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:44,434
beach and put a big wall around it and 
keep everyone out of the private beach 

1595
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,330
and had like their own little zone and 
this is,

1596
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,860
this is my zone and my stuff and my 
giant house and you'd actually go on the

1597
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,450
beach is kind of her hilarious.

1598
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,450
Holding like a chunk of beach.
Like you don't own that bitch.

1599
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,930
Like you decided to put a giant.
Don't try next to the ocean.

1600
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,170
Do they have security guards in Malibu?
Yeah.

1601
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:06,340
Try to keep people off of public 
beaches.

1602
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,190
They say this is a private beach,
like no,

1603
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,510
no,
it's connected to the ocean.

1604
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:12,820
Motherfucker.
Like your yard is the ocean.

1605
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,190
Yeah.
Like my friend has kids.

1606
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,100
He has a

1607
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,933
beach house and my friend has kids and 
the kids Surf and the kids were surfing 

1608
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,260
just,
you know,

1609
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:24,920
a few hundred yards from their house and
they were in front of this guy's house.

1610
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:27,470
The guy comes out of the House fucking 
screaming at them saying,

1611
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,530
get the fuck Outta here.
You're not supposed to be here.

1612
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,320
Like,
nope.

1613
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,153
You can't tell people that just because 
you spend a lot of money on a house 

1614
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,440
that's on the beach.
It doesn't mean you own the beach.

1615
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:38,060
You don't.
That's the beach.

1616
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,223
It's the whole Earth's beach.
Like someone can come here from all 

1617
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,020
around the world and walk on that beach.
That's,

1618
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,000
that's your yard.
You fucked up.

1619
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,223
You bought this $15 million dollar house
that anybody could walk 30 feet from 

1620
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:54,050
your house.
Like that's just how it is,

1621
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:55,250
dude.
Sorry.

1622
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:56,143
Isn't that weird that people don't get 
that they've finally gotten to super 

1623
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,200
ultra rich category that the rules don't
apply anymore?

1624
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,010
Well,
they're just trying that.

1625
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:05,853
I'm disgraced peaches,
mind they're trying to scare people off 

1626
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,074
of it,
so they've hired a lot of security 

1627
01:09:09,801 --> 01:09:11,500
guards.
See if you can find the article.

1628
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,823
How miserable of those people imagine 
being that person who's like yelling at 

1629
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:17,180
kids because they're in front on the 
beach.

1630
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,103
Yeah.
That guy is living in his own personal 

1631
01:09:19,131 --> 01:09:20,490
hell.
I don't care how rich it is.

1632
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,300
It's just.
It's just stupid.

1633
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:24,463
Like if you live on the beach,
you have to kind of accept that your 

1634
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:28,454
house is next to this public park.
You're essentially living in a public 

1635
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:35,390
park.
Mean you have his dope view.

1636
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:38,240
You get to look at the ocean.
What's.

1637
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:39,074
Yeah,
but what's in front of your house is 

1638
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,170
everybody's.
It just is everybody's.

1639
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,633
You don't.
You can't own it and it's never not 

1640
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:46,190
going to be.
And it moves.

1641
01:09:46,191 --> 01:09:47,024
It goes,
and that's one of the weird things that 

1642
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:48,464
happened.

1643
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,620
Apparently they did something in Santa 
Barbara.

1644
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,080
They did something to the,
to the ocean.

1645
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:56,480
They did something like they put up some
sort of a barrier,

1646
01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:01,630
some sort of break in Santa Barbara and 
it affected broad beach in a crazy way,

1647
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:03,404
like it pushed the water way closer 
because one of the good things about 

1648
01:10:06,381 --> 01:10:07,214
broad beach,
these I think they call a billionaire 

1649
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,280
beach,
was that these people,

1650
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:11,114
these crazy fucking houses,
they had this long stretch of sand 

1651
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:18,950
before the water and then the water came
way up to almost to where the houses are

1652
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:20,210
now.
So it's all gone,

1653
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:21,283
but now the people that utilize the 
beach are literally right from these 

1654
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,930
people's houses.
So they're fucking freaking out crazy.

1655
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,940
We've seen.
Is there any articles about.

1656
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,803
Yeah,
so these people have hired security 

1657
01:10:31,701 --> 01:10:32,534
guards to kick people off and then 
people are getting together and these 

1658
01:10:35,271 --> 01:10:37,860
lawsuits against these people that own 
these houses.

1659
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:42,290
So you can't keep us off the hatches and
I never want to be those people dark.

1660
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,140
Can we establish that and I just,
I just want to keep those people here.

1661
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:46,003
I just want to keep going.
Surfing and bowling and how the 

1662
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,164
wealthier laying claim to the cow,
to California's coast complaints have 

1663
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:54,120
been streaming about security guards,
uh,

1664
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:57,800
hired by wealthy homeowner homeowners,
removing people from public beaches.

1665
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:00,740
You can't,
those security guards,

1666
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,290
they can't do anything.
Like if they touched you,

1667
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:04,603
like be assault.
Like you can't tell me I can't walk on 

1668
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:09,110
the beach.
You can't,

1669
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,390
you can't do anything.
I was trying to read through this.

1670
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,980
The first case says that security guard 
went

1671
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,813
and got a sheriff and the sheriff told 
them that they're going to get a ticket 

1672
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:17,730
if they didn't cut off the beach.

1673
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,480
The sheriffs are all scared because 
they'll,

1674
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:24,600
all those people won the influence of 
all these wealthy people.

1675
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,000
The wealthy people influenced the 
politicians.

1676
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:29,130
The sheriff's want to keep their jobs.
I mean,

1677
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:33,780
the whole thing is just crazy.
But the thing is now today this stuff is

1678
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:34,614
getting out and it's getting out on the 
Internet and it's getting out in these 

1679
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:40,230
stories and articles that are on the 
Internet.

1680
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:44,550
Homeowners have employed several tactics
to keep their beach front properties.

1681
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:45,384
Private.
Recent example of a case in Malibu and 

1682
01:11:47,031 --> 01:11:47,864
vibe involved a property owner charging 
people $40 to walk on the beach and 

1683
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:52,314
banning surfing.
Unless the person was a resident or a 

1684
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:54,840
friend of a resident.

1685
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:58,550
What you can't.
You can't just decide.

1686
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:59,683
That's crazy.
That's like literally going up to a 

1687
01:12:01,011 --> 01:12:03,620
state park and saying,
no one can go in here.

1688
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:05,960
It's too close to my house.
Yeah,

1689
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:08,730
there's nothing right about that stuff 
and I don't get,

1690
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:12,410
I don't,
I just hate that kind of right there.

1691
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:15,620
That mentality that gives me the 
gnarliest anxiety.

1692
01:12:15,621 --> 01:12:17,570
I just don't want to be anywhere near 
those people.

1693
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:18,693
I just want to get a far far away from 
them and like live in the mountains in 

1694
01:12:20,721 --> 01:12:21,554
Hawaii or.
I do

1695
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:22,723
look at this.
She had been on the beach with just a 

1696
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,180
few minutes with a tall uniform security
guard approached.

1697
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:27,223
He said he told Schwartz she was 
trespassing on private property and 

1698
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:34,250
threatened her with a $1,500
fine and a court citation

1699
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,380
if she didn't leave,
she's an employee to have the uh,

1700
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:39,250
mission,

1701
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,450
right?
She said yeah,

1702
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:41,284
she's a commissioned employee.
Was asked to do some reconnaissance 

1703
01:12:43,451 --> 01:12:47,470
falling stream of formal complaints.
At that point I pulled out the maps that

1704
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:49,000
I had and said,
you know,

1705
01:12:49,001 --> 01:12:51,010
this is a public area.
Swartz were called,

1706
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:51,844
but the guard disregarded her insistence
after telling her she needed to provide 

1707
01:12:55,211 --> 01:12:56,830
legal proof that she had a right to be 
there.

1708
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,664
The guard left and returned 20 minutes 
later with two sheriff's deputies who 

1709
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:00,934
slipped swiftly.
Advisor Schwartz at the beach was not 

1710
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:06,550
for public use.
Then I got a bit unsettled.

1711
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:09,250
She remembers as brave as I like to 
think I am.

1712
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,280
I kind of started shaking a little bit 
and started to get a little nervous.

1713
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:13,420
Did you read it?
That was,

1714
01:13:13,421 --> 01:13:14,254
um,

1715
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,170
if you go back up,
Jamie,

1716
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:19,090
it'll say,
whose house that was?

1717
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:22,840
I think it was David Geffen's daily that
happened also near his house.

1718
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,570
Same.
Deliberately restricted public access.

1719
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:29,920
That same thing happen with Mark 
Zuckerberg on quiet.

1720
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:30,953
It's 2013.
The Guardian reported how entertainment 

1721
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,150
mogul David Geffen had deliberately 
restricted,

1722
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:35,984
deliberately restricted public access to
the beach near his home and carbon 

1723
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:39,780
beach.
Yeah,

1724
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,230
that's another really.
You can't do do

1725
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:42,070
that.
Yeah.

1726
01:13:42,071 --> 01:13:44,650
Mark Zuckerberg did that.
Alkali real.

1727
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,513
Yeah,
he bought up this beautiful property on 

1728
01:13:46,181 --> 01:13:48,340
the north coast of Clive's.
Incredible,

1729
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:49,174
beautiful place with incredible waves 
and not that many people live there and 

1730
01:13:51,971 --> 01:13:52,804
he bought this insane like thousands of 
acres right there when the most 

1731
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:56,464
beautiful places on earth and then try 
to keep everybody out and like 

1732
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,630
completely blocked all the access and 
all the Hawaiians,

1733
01:14:01,631 --> 01:14:05,080
all the local people got extremely angry
with him and if he just would have been.

1734
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,090
I mean he.
He's going to be a resident,

1735
01:14:07,091 --> 01:14:09,220
right?
You wouldn't think this little island on

1736
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,630
coal eyes.
People been living there.

1737
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,453
You can't just like storm in there by 
all the property up and block everyone 

1738
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:18,190
out.
How you got to deliver and I don't know,

1739
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:21,600
but is it like alumni sized or smaller?
Malott more than.

1740
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,453
Yeah,
a lot more.

1741
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,850
Yeah,
probably be 40,000

1742
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:25,400
or something like that.

1743
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,800
Maybe 30,000,
but you know,

1744
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,733
the people on choir really territorial 
and protective of where they live and 

1745
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,624
they live in a really beautiful place 
and a lot of people who aren't from 

1746
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:38,980
there.
We have lots of money,

1747
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:40,570
want to live there,
people,

1748
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,000
people inquire hypersensitive to that 
already.

1749
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,880
So you got like Mark Zuckerberg,
you know,

1750
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,620
probably worth $80,000,000,000
or something.

1751
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:50,140
Come in there and buy up all the land 
and try and block everyone.

1752
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:53,470
It's not a good move.
While he's probably a terrible move,

1753
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,080
but he's probably super insulated to 
people.

1754
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:57,940
Right?
I mean everywhere that guy goes,

1755
01:14:57,941 --> 01:15:00,180
he brings security guards with them or 
you'd have to.

1756
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,203
And he's probably like,
he probably has almost no interaction 

1757
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,740
with regular people you would think.
So these young man so young,

1758
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:11,380
he's like 34 some shit.
How old is he,

1759
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:12,214
Jamie?

1760
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,660
What's your worth?
$80.

1761
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,490
Billion.
Imagine being in your thirties and worth

1762
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:20,290
$80,000,000,000.
Still working.

1763
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,910
How about that?
That's cool though.

1764
01:15:21,911 --> 01:15:23,860
I love that about these guys.
Like um,

1765
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:25,610
I wouldn't do it,
but like Elon Musk and,

1766
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,580
and,
and Zuckerberg,

1767
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:28,560
it's,
it's cool.

1768
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,540
Those guys believe so much that they can
actually make a difference,

1769
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:32,374
that they're still,
that's the only reason that's keeping 

1770
01:15:33,361 --> 01:15:35,900
them where it's not the money.
He paid $100,

1771
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:38,740
million dollars to purchase 700 acres of
land.

1772
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,500
Wow.
It's 34,

1773
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,630
34.
That's crazy.

1774
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:47,260
Straight up bowling ball and out.
Woo As balling.

1775
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:49,660
There's a big difference in him and 
Nealon Musto.

1776
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,093
He's got a weird reputation of fucking 
over the people that he'd made made 

1777
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:57,490
facebook with.
I don't know if that's correct or not,

1778
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:58,810
but that movie,
man,

1779
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:00,970
I sue the fuck out of those people made 
that movie.

1780
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,010
If that's not true,
right in the movie,

1781
01:16:03,011 --> 01:16:04,870
they kind of set it up like he stole the
idea.

1782
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,100
Well,
he had to settle.

1783
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:06,993
He settled out of court.
Paid a lot of millions to like the 

1784
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:11,630
winklevoss brothers I think to,
to uh,

1785
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,190
because they said it was their idea.
Yeah.

1786
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,200
They made him look like a Dick in that 
movie though.

1787
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:16,923
They shared it.
It's kind of heavy that that movie 

1788
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:19,810
actually got made.
You would think that they would have got

1789
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:21,190
paid off to not make it.
Well,

1790
01:16:21,191 --> 01:16:22,930
it's weird to make a movie about a 
person,

1791
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:28,090
even if they got accurate reports from 
other people.

1792
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:28,953
It's so weird to make a movie about a 
person who's still alive right now and 

1793
01:16:31,861 --> 01:16:34,080
put words in his mouth.
Has a lot of it is speculation too,

1794
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:35,560
no matter what.
For sure.

1795
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:36,650
Yeah.
Off Light.

1796
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,133
It says that the settlement was $20,
million in cash and $45 million in 

1797
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:44,740
facebook stock price.
They're worth billions.

1798
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:46,060
Yeah,
he got off light.

1799
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,770
Yeah.
If he did dick them over.

1800
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,090
But who knows if they're telling the 
truth version,

1801
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:53,530
there's always.
There's always two sides to every story,

1802
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,373
but a movie about you.
Like if somebody made a movie about you 

1803
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,753
and you know,
had you on the beach saying some shit 

1804
01:16:59,021 --> 01:17:00,550
you never really said like,
Hey,

1805
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:01,773
I didn't say those words.
You can't have me say those words with 

1806
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:09,931
an actor's inflection and his decisions 
to make whatever creative he makes with

1807
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,963
the way he talks.
And Ninety nine percent of the people 

1808
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:15,410
watching that movie aren't having this 
conversation with people.

1809
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:17,450
They just automatically think that 
Zuckerberg,

1810
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,470
that's what happened.
Dick,

1811
01:17:18,471 --> 01:17:19,610
he's a dick.
He did that.

1812
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,350
He did those.
That's the perception.

1813
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:22,790
It's like if you,
uh,

1814
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,680
if like Jamie was like,
hey,

1815
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:26,840
you know what,
I just got fired by Joe.

1816
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,620
Fuck that guy.
You know what?

1817
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:29,943
Joe's Joe.
Joe Tried to touch me this one day when 

1818
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:35,540
I was shooting the techno target target.
He tried to touch me.

1819
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:36,643
Everyone had maybe believe Jamie,
especially if he was like a really 

1820
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,040
pretty girl.
Yeah.

1821
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,620
Jamie can be a pretty girl if he shaves 
hair.

1822
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,553
It goes.
I tried to stop it being God damn ad 

1823
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:47,144
blocker.
He did try to stop it being made 

1824
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,140
according to this.
Yeah.

1825
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:50,643
Shin.
You would though would need to stop the 

1826
01:17:52,161 --> 01:17:53,900
movie,
the social network for being made.

1827
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:56,680
I was from those leaks on emails that 
came out in that hacking thing.

1828
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,760
Oh,
of course he did,

1829
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,610
but I think he has a right to it 
honestly.

1830
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:02,480
Yeah.
Here's the thing,

1831
01:18:02,481 --> 01:18:06,550
pretty heavy that someone can make a 
movie about you without your consent and

1832
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,930
put words in your mouth.
That would be the thing.

1833
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,380
It'd be one thing if you were convicted 
in a court of law for that stuff,

1834
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:14,090
but if,
if this is just like,

1835
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:15,620
yeah,
I swear this happened.

1836
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,360
See,
here's the thing though,

1837
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,390
it's one thing if there's a documentary 
and the documentary,

1838
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:21,224
they're showing footage where Zuckerberg
is doing certain things and saying 

1839
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:25,670
certain things.
It's a total different situation.

1840
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:26,504
If you decide to put words in that guy's
mouth and you have fucking Justin 

1841
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:34,610
timberlake plan in a movie.
Who Played Him in the movie?

1842
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,450
I think it was justin timberlake.
Was it Justin Trudeau?

1843
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,443
Yeah,
he's in it.

1844
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,150
Jesse Eisenberg.
So you have a famous actor.

1845
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:48,020
The famous actor plays you in a movie 
and makes you out to be a con.

1846
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,610
That sucks.
It's his choice.

1847
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:52,240
He sucks and then the director is like,
make it a little more country.

1848
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,410
Can you do a little more contained?
Like,

1849
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:55,490
okay,
I'll go a little more of a dick.

1850
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:58,550
I'll be a little more removed here.
We'll try a little more removed.

1851
01:18:58,551 --> 01:18:59,810
This next take.
Yeah.

1852
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,180
It's like you can't do that.
You should.

1853
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:03,583
You should be able to sue the fuck out 
of those people because at the end of 

1854
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,030
the day,
it's one thing to tell a story.

1855
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,010
Hey,
I worked with Zuckerberg.

1856
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:11,870
That guy was a dick.
He stole my ideas.

1857
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,823
It's another thing to have someone play 
him in a movie and make up a bunch of 

1858
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:19,250
words that he didn't really say or you 
don't know.

1859
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,100
He really said,
Oh,

1860
01:19:20,101 --> 01:19:20,934
you don't have any proof that.
He really said that's a fucking snitch 

1861
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:23,873
range.
Like I've always felt that way about 

1862
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:27,014
historical movies.
Like they make a movie about Abraham 

1863
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,200
Lincoln.
Like someone was saying,

1864
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,960
how the fuck did they do a movie?
Abraham Lincoln,

1865
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,850
vampire killer,
you know?

1866
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,100
See,
that's too heavy.

1867
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,050
It was really ridiculous.
Abraham Lincoln was killer.

1868
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:42,560
Was one of the dumbest movies ever take 
to make it east killing vampires.

1869
01:19:42,561 --> 01:19:44,750
I think with an ax,
think he killed them with an ax.

1870
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,270
It was really stupid,
but I was saying,

1871
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:48,200
yeah,
it's dumb,

1872
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,290
but is it any dumber than any other 
Abraham Lincoln movie?

1873
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:54,140
You have a bunch of movies about Abraham
Lincoln where he's just hanging out with

1874
01:19:54,141 --> 01:19:55,880
his kids and talk.
You don't know what the fuck.

1875
01:19:55,881 --> 01:19:56,714
He said,
you don't know what kind of interaction 

1876
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:00,800
he actually had with his wife.
You weren't there.

1877
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,450
How do you.
How do you pitch that movie to a studio?

1878
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:06,591
You know what,
guys?

1879
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:08,340
I got this concept,
I got this concept.

1880
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,533
That's when you know you've got way too 
much money is when you're making movies 

1881
01:20:10,981 --> 01:20:13,320
about Abraham Lincoln and being a 
vampire killer.

1882
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,100
Yeah.
Pull up.

1883
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,740
Pull up the trailer for Abraham Lincoln,
vampire slayer.

1884
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,920
I was trying to remember if I remember 
correctly though.

1885
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:20,754
This came at a time to the guy that 
wrote the book that this movie was made 

1886
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:27,720
from wrote pride and pride,
pride and prejudice and zombies were.

1887
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:29,400
He rewrote pro,
excuse me,

1888
01:20:29,401 --> 01:20:30,234
pride and browse,
but added a zombie like plot throughout 

1889
01:20:33,781 --> 01:20:36,030
it,
so we had to say he mashed up the story.

1890
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,850
It was successful.
So he did it again with like an amber,

1891
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,820
Abraham Lincoln,
a biography,

1892
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:42,683
but added vampires to it.
Is there demand and it went and the 

1893
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:48,300
demand that is there enough people on 
earth that wants to watch shit movies?

1894
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:51,220
Seriously.
I don't know,

1895
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,800
man.
Time is precious.

1896
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:55,440
I want to watch something really good.
Not really bad.

1897
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:56,881
I don't know,
man.

1898
01:20:56,881 --> 01:20:58,260
There's nobody walking into that movie 
like,

1899
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,663
this is going to be sick.
You might be operating on a higher 

1900
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,124
frequency than most.
There's a lot of people out there that 

1901
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:06,390
just want to be entertained but 
stupidity.

1902
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,850
He'll give me.
Give me full screen on this stupid piece

1903
01:21:08,851 --> 01:21:09,684
of shit.
I watched this thing high as a kite to 

1904
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,910
you watch this movie.
Oh yeah.

1905
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,380
Were you.
Were you.

1906
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,340
Were you in that shack on the big island
when you watch this?

1907
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,053
Tim Burton?

1908
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,383
Yeah.

1909
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,153
This,
this trailer actually looks pretty 

1910
01:21:34,491 --> 01:21:39,491
fucking cool.
See watching him tell Liam Neeson.

1911
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,000
Look,
it's fucking up all these vampires.

1912
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,400
Wow.
Abraham Lincoln,

1913
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:08,450
vampire hunter.
He chopped down that tree with one swing

1914
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,910
duty.
So bad ass.

1915
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,210
Very high percentage of people watching 
that movie.

1916
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:16,740
Where high.
Yeah.

1917
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:17,574
Well see,
I think I see things that are not good 

1918
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,630
for my job.
See,

1919
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:22,830
I will.
Yeah.

1920
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:23,753
I will go.
I will watch movies and television 

1921
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:27,360
shows.
I will watch things hoping.

1922
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:30,210
Hoping it's sucked bad enough to become 
a part of my.

1923
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,190
He didn't have to hope very hard to do.
That.

1924
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:34,920
Doesn't make it in there.
I watched this as where the whole thing.

1925
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:36,180
I was like,
fuck.

1926
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:38,670
It looks like jokes like a,
like a,

1927
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,770
like a,
like a joke factory does.

1928
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,300
It looks like it should be a joke 
factory.

1929
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:43,981
It's not.
Well,

1930
01:22:43,981 --> 01:22:47,380
maybe someone better than me came out 
like two months before the.

1931
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:51,080
The Lincoln movie with Daniel Day Lewis,
like rushed it out to.

1932
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,020
That guy is amazing.

1933
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,340
By the way,
Daniel Day Lewis.

1934
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:55,380
Holy Moly.
But that was another movie that bothered

1935
01:22:55,381 --> 01:22:56,550
me.
I saw the Daniel Day.

1936
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:59,220
Lewis Lincoln movie was kind of dull to 
slow.

1937
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,133
Yeah,
but it bothered me that we don't really 

1938
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:05,350
know what the fuck this guy said.
It's one thing like there will be blood,

1939
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:06,750
which was fucking amazing.
Yeah,

1940
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:09,070
but those are fake people.
Man.

1941
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:11,200
He looked good as Lincoln.
Crazy.

1942
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,850
Crazy.
How good they made them out.

1943
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:16,260
Remember gangs in New York when he was 
bob the butcher bill.

1944
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,980
Billy butcher.
Yeah.

1945
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,780
He's phenomenal.
He's great in everything.

1946
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,720
So good man.
He's just one of those guys.

1947
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:24,580
It just becomes completely.
There's one.

1948
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,443
There's a few people that a lot of 
people that are actors that are just 

1949
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,540
Weirdos.
They're just these really strange people

1950
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,374
that desperately want attention.
They figured out a way to use their 

1951
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:37,870
mental illness to,
to navigate the waters of Hollywood.

1952
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:41,530
In some strange way where their virtue 
signaling and and,

1953
01:23:41,531 --> 01:23:42,364
and,
and behaving exactly the way Hollywood 

1954
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:48,280
wants them to behave to get themselves 
into these positions of fame,

1955
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:51,790
and then they become movie stars and 
they say a bunch of nonsense and these,

1956
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,340
you hear them interviewed you,
like you're not even a person.

1957
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,890
Like,
this is not a person.

1958
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,030
It's not a person talking.
There's no sincerity,

1959
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,013
there's no reality to it.
You just painfully aware of every word 

1960
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:04,270
you're saying and how people going to 
perceive it.

1961
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,740
And you just know there's no Ouzo your 
guards never down.

1962
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:09,783
They're just Weirdos.
And then there's people like Daniel Day 

1963
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:16,420
Lewis who is just this savage.
You just figures out how to become these

1964
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,940
real deal.
Yeah.

1965
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,100
Yeah.
I mean he fucking stays in character.

1966
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:22,660
That was great.
Last the Mohicans.

1967
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:25,030
He's so good.
He's fucking great and everything.

1968
01:24:25,031 --> 01:24:25,850
You retired,
you know,

1969
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:26,540
he does now.

1970
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:27,760
Huh?
Make shoes.

1971
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,870
Are you serious?
Yeah,

1972
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,110
he is a cobbler.
He makes shoes by hand.

1973
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,270
That's what he does.
Wow.

1974
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:35,290
Yeah.
He's a legend.

1975
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:36,340
I back,
dude,

1976
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:39,520
are you kidding me?
And he was so good.

1977
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:40,770
Hilda the butcher.
Yeah,

1978
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,080
I would fly to wherever the fuck he is.
You get a shoe made by him.

1979
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,360
Should do it.
I should.

1980
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:47,343
I wonder if you make shoes for people 
probably just makes shoes for his 

1981
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:52,450
friends would like,
does he have a company?

1982
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:53,613
Like I know he makes shoes,
but like what does he do at these God 

1983
01:24:55,741 --> 01:24:57,490
damn shoes?
What's his lifestyle like?

1984
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,170
You know what I mean?
After all that like,

1985
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:00,673
you know,
I was saying like all those crazy 

1986
01:25:01,211 --> 01:25:03,520
moments I got human potential like you 
know,

1987
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,413
his human potential of his,
like acting craft like during like last 

1988
01:25:07,211 --> 01:25:08,630
Mohicans and,
and uh,

1989
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:12,160
gangs in New York and stuff like going 
from that like extreme,

1990
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:16,780
those extreme highs and yeah,
know performance levels to making shoes.

1991
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:20,170
That's crazy.
Usually people go up not,

1992
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,220
not,
you know,

1993
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,820
up in intensity,
not down intensity.

1994
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:24,693
Right,
right.

1995
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,583
Yeah.
The intensity aspect of it is really 

1996
01:25:26,711 --> 01:25:28,000
interesting.
But I think for him,

1997
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:28,923
like he's,
he's such an artist that I don't think 

1998
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:34,060
he cares whether or not people are 
looking at his art.

1999
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:37,060
I think he cares about the process of 
creating.

2000
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,220
So I think the same to him.
Yeah,

2001
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,640
I think the process,
well maybe even more pure because of the

2002
01:25:42,641 --> 01:25:45,160
fact that it doesn't have any adulation.
There's no.

2003
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:47,890
There's no spotlight on it.
There's no publicity team.

2004
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,020
There's no stupid interviews he asked to
do.

2005
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,480
You know what I mean?
I'm like,

2006
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,313
yeah,
that stuff must be maddening for him to 

2007
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:56,800
sit down with someone from fucking e 
entertainment television.

2008
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,810
So mad.
You got another dope movie coming out.

2009
01:25:59,020 --> 01:25:59,853
Tell us about.
It sounds like you need a Daniel Day 

2010
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,100
Lewis on the podcast here.
He'd

2011
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,600
be freaking amazing,
but maybe he would have.

2012
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:07,940
Cool.
That'd be to talk about shoes.

2013
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:08,774
You probably be cycling on that.
Maybe I will talk to that guy for three 

2014
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:14,320
hours just about shoes.
If he was into.

2015
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:16,070
Just tell me about your stitching 
process.

2016
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:18,920
Like what do you choose your leather?
I don't think,

2017
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,110
from what I just read,
I don't think that he does it.

2018
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:21,944
It says that he took time off from 
making movies to study under this very 

2019
01:26:25,341 --> 01:26:29,110
well known shoemaker for 10 months 
specifically and only did thou.

2020
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,313
Then he came back though.
He made a movie like last year called 

2021
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:32,720
the phantom thread,
which were,

2022
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,670
he was a designer,
a fashion designer,

2023
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,520
and then he learned to,
uh,

2024
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:39,570
in order to do that he reverse 
engineered a Valencia,

2025
01:26:39,571 --> 01:26:44,320
Aka dress and to just to learn how to 
become a fashion Jaga dressed.

2026
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:44,820
You know what,
that we,

2027
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:47,150
we pulled up at the blend stock as a 
company.

2028
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:50,190
It's that they make that shirt we made,
we put up a few weeks ago,

2029
01:26:50,191 --> 01:26:52,340
he doubles shirt thing.
So it's a high end,

2030
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:53,910
very high end stuff.
Um,

2031
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,333
so yeah,
and then put it back together again so 

2032
01:26:57,591 --> 01:26:59,270
he could understand the process of doing
it.

2033
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,940
That was like his for us,
how he became it,

2034
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,610
got into character for the,
for that movie.

2035
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,410
So I don't know if he's retired all the 
way.

2036
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:07,633
It doesn't seem like he makes a believer
he retired and when he made that movie 

2037
01:27:10,521 --> 01:27:13,070
last year though,
since 2017 for a while,

2038
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:14,690
he likes six.
There's only one way to find out.

2039
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,670
He did retire.
It took some time off as Daniel.

2040
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,630
If you're out there anytime to just 
Holler at me.

2041
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,310
I don't know.
I know you don't have a dog,

2042
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,440
but I know you don't have a twitter,
but I got people.

2043
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:25,274
You got people.

2044
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,890
He was amazing in the movie.
The boxer two,

2045
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,000
in my opinion,
he did.

2046
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,103
He played the most believable 
professional boxer in a film because a 

2047
01:27:37,781 --> 01:27:42,781
lot of films like even like the movie 
with Marky mark where he played,

2048
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:44,410
um,
micky ward.

2049
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:47,800
It was like Mark Walberg knows how to 
punch.

2050
01:27:47,801 --> 01:27:48,634
He knows how to throw punches,
but there's a difference between 

2051
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:54,340
throwing punches in a movie and a guy 
throwing punches in a fight.

2052
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,593
And if you look at the way Daniel Day 
Lewis is performing in that boxing 

2053
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:00,154
movie,
he looks like a guy who's throwing 

2054
01:28:02,081 --> 01:28:04,540
punches in a fight.
It's way more realistic.

2055
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,613
Any boxing movie I've ever seen.
And he boxed for a full year before we 

2056
01:28:08,891 --> 01:28:12,400
did that movie.
You mean just lived in a boxing gym.

2057
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,650
He trained all the time,
sparred,

2058
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,350
hit the pads.
He got real coaching from.

2059
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,333
He played a guy who is an Ira guy who 
got out of jail and then got back into 

2060
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:24,430
boxing and then there's a bunch of 
terrorists,

2061
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:26,890
shit involved in the film's very good 
movie,

2062
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:29,770
but see if you can find footage of him 
from that movie.

2063
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,280
So when,
when you see boxing movies,

2064
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,100
guys are throwing punches like they know
they're not going to get hit back.

2065
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,470
Like this is a certain thing about 
boxing.

2066
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:40,510
Like if you watch a guy actually 
fighting,

2067
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:41,463
there's a tension,
there's a tension to worry about her 

2068
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,230
getting hit back and you see a movie 
about a boxer goes like,

2069
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:49,210
hey man,
it's just too much.

2070
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,580
The myths are down,
their chins out.

2071
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,430
It's not just that.
It's like the way they're moving.

2072
01:28:54,431 --> 01:28:58,000
There's no anticipation.
There's no offense.

2073
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:00,850
Right?
Even when they're getting hit,

2074
01:29:00,851 --> 01:29:02,130
it's bullshit.
It's

2075
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:06,870
like you can tell it makes it drives me 
crazy to watch him in here.

2076
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:08,880
I mean,
this guy,

2077
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,710
he,
he studied and trained,

2078
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,260
I forget who was training,
um,

2079
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:16,020
but it was like legit professional 
boxers see crazy.

2080
01:29:16,021 --> 01:29:16,854
That commitment that these guys do to 
take their acting to the next level 

2081
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:21,053
because it's like there's not that many 
people who have noticed that he fights 

2082
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:25,410
more like a real fighter.
You know what I'm saying?

2083
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,431
No,
there's not.

2084
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:27,264
But even like see like other ways 
throwing these punches like this is the 

2085
01:29:29,341 --> 01:29:33,120
way a real boxer throws punches.
Like they're not wide.

2086
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:37,520
Everything's real tight.
Pretty fucking impressive.

2087
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:40,850
But I mean I would expect nothing else 
from this guy.

2088
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:42,900
Yeah,
he's legit.

2089
01:29:42,901 --> 01:29:44,670
He's a madman.
Yeah.

2090
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:47,390
Legit.
But it'd be a real Weirdo to talk to.

2091
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:48,480
Yeah,
I know.

2092
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:50,250
It's only one way to find out.
Yeah.

2093
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:52,740
You want me to get them on?
When are we going hunting?

2094
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:56,400
I Dunno.
I think June you want to do may or June.

2095
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:57,700
Let's try to plan something.
Yeah,

2096
01:29:57,910 --> 01:30:00,090
for sure.
The Nih does the next one.

2097
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:01,043
You should come with us to Dudley's 
place in Oklahoma and in March we're 

2098
01:30:04,801 --> 01:30:06,480
going to go pig hunting.
That'd be fun.

2099
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,550
It's infested march

2100
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,193
actually.
The size of that gigantic pig that he 

2101
01:30:12,561 --> 01:30:13,560
shot down there.
Yeah,

2102
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:17,150
I did monster 450 pound pig.
Shit.

2103
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,650
It's like a tank,
so it's as big as this table,

2104
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:24,470
these huge big pork chops.
It's the three of us stack together form

2105
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,270
the form.
It's so mark shake.

2106
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:28,403
Yeah.
We're going to do it in March and it 

2107
01:30:29,501 --> 01:30:30,331
sounds like fun.
Yeah.

2108
01:30:30,331 --> 01:30:34,590
He has a giant place that he leases in 
Oklahoma and it's all.

2109
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,890
It's all just just beautiful,
wild,

2110
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:40,470
open country.
Oklahoma's very underrated.

2111
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,510
You ever been to Oklahoma?
I've never been to the Midwest.

2112
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,110
Ohio tomorrow.
Oh,

2113
01:30:45,111 --> 01:30:46,950
you're going white tail hunt the first 
time ever.

2114
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:48,150
Is that the Midwest?
Yes.

2115
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,253
See,
I've never even know where the Midwest 

2116
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,620
is.
Hawaii.

2117
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:57,860
Yeah.
Know Ohio's shit.

2118
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,420
I'm a Midwest Virgin,
so I'm going back to Ohio.

2119
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:01,800
That's actually where my mom is from,
so.

2120
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:02,730
Oh,
that's cool.

2121
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,070
What part of a why or what part of Ohio 
rather?

2122
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:07,270
I think the southern part.
I'm going,

2123
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,970
I'm going to white tail hunting right 
now.

2124
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:10,760
I've got to go.
And what part of Mrs?

2125
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,620
Right in the middle.
So that's Portsmith Kentucky area.

2126
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:16,590
Maybe you're Cincinnati.
I'm is my favorite spot.

2127
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,590
I'm hoping it's not too cold.
Columbus,

2128
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:22,440
the Shit I'm a big fan of Cleveland to,
but God Damn Columbus is a shit.

2129
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:24,520
Columbus is awesome.
I'm excited to see it.

2130
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,620
Just for whatever font,
what I.

2131
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,450
I'm guessing it's foreign lands flat,
is that right?

2132
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,120
Not Flat.
That's the misinterpretations.

2133
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:34,343
It's flatter than most areas for sure,
but like especially down from Columbus 

2134
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:39,600
down to the South area where the rivers 
go,

2135
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:40,434
there's a spa,
there's Indian mounds and there's all 

2136
01:31:42,391 --> 01:31:45,510
sorts of a glacier cut out spaces.

2137
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:46,523
Yeah,
the hocking hills is a very cool spot 

2138
01:31:47,631 --> 01:31:50,670
and there's also this old man's cave is 
a really cool spot to.

2139
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:51,953
It's like a traditional.
I think Columbus is one of the most 

2140
01:31:53,971 --> 01:31:56,040
underrated cities in the country.
Yeah.

2141
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,810
Yeah.
People don't think about it as it's like

2142
01:31:57,811 --> 01:32:02,270
the people are fucking cool.
It's a really good place to stand up for

2143
01:32:02,271 --> 01:32:04,540
stand up comedy.
So one of the best places in the world.

2144
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:07,300
It's just fucking phenomenal.
They're smart,

2145
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,880
but they're also like midwest type 
people,

2146
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:10,900
but they uh,
but they,

2147
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,580
they're not stuck up.
Right.

2148
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,600
You know,
it's like,

2149
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,360
it's like a,
almost like Chicago.

2150
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:18,130
It's like a lot like Chicago.
I think.

2151
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:19,990
Well,
I'm not going to see it.

2152
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:21,880
I'm just gonna.
Go straight to my tree stand.

2153
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,660
Yeah.
Treestand hung.

2154
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:24,623
Have you ever done it before?
I've done a little bit of trees down 

2155
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,250
hunting,
but it's a mind fuck.

2156
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,540
I'm really bad at.
I'm.

2157
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,830
I'm,
I'm impatient.

2158
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,480
I like to be stocking.
I like to be on the move.

2159
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:37,330
I like to be finding deer.
I like to be,

2160
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:38,750
you know,
I like that being.

2161
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:42,280
I like to hunt.
I want to be the hunter and so for me,

2162
01:32:42,281 --> 01:32:45,580
like sitting in a tree for four days 
straight,

2163
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,470
it will be interesting to see if I have 
what it takes.

2164
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:50,770
It's weird too because oddly aware that 
if you fail,

2165
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:51,604
you're fucked.
Like you have to wear a harness and all 

2166
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:55,990
that jazz.
Like I did it with Dudley the first time

2167
01:32:55,991 --> 01:32:59,440
I ever treat.
I've hunted deer before on the ground in

2168
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:01,630
a ground blind,
but the first time ever did it in a tree

2169
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:04,210
stand was at Dudley's place.
That's where you gotta go.

2170
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:07,060
Dudley.
Dudley has the craziest spot.

2171
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:08,580
I'm going to hit up.
Dudley then Doug,

2172
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:12,520
he's got like 600 acres all bowhunting.

2173
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,410
He lives in,
he lives in.

2174
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,440
He literally lives in White Tail 
Paradigm.

2175
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:18,303
Wow.
He lives in Iowa right in one of the 

2176
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:22,600
best places in the world.
For him to send me a text,

2177
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,610
send him a text.
Have you down.

2178
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:28,120
You got to check it for an Iowa tag 
though.

2179
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:30,070
It's going to be cold this week.
Cool as fuck.

2180
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:31,590
Son.
Prepare for girl.

2181
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:32,680
Hi.
Era Hawaiian.

2182
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:33,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2183
01:33:33,970 --> 01:33:36,490
Does under armour have some good white 
tail close?

2184
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:36,941
They do,
yeah.

2185
01:33:36,941 --> 01:33:38,530
They sent.
They sent me some really,

2186
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:39,364
really warm clothes for hunting.
You might want to get one of those 

2187
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:44,530
thermal fucking things.
Have you seen the heated sleeping bags?

2188
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,000
Oh yeah.
Those are dope.

2189
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:47,950
Dude.
You could wear one of those up there.

2190
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,510
I could.
Yeah.

2191
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:51,400
Yeah.
They have those things.

2192
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:54,970
What are they called in inferno suits or
something like that.

2193
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:56,470
What are those things called?
See,

2194
01:33:56,471 --> 01:33:58,210
the thing is I like.

2195
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:00,520
I like hunting and cold weather.
I love it.

2196
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:03,640
Super cold weather.
Even if I can in my stocking around,

2197
01:34:03,641 --> 01:34:05,530
I can walk around.
You can move.

2198
01:34:05,710 --> 01:34:07,300
It's not that cold,
but if you.

2199
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,310
The whole point of sitting in a tree 
stand,

2200
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,293
you have to try and sit completely 100 
percent still and move as little as 

2201
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:15,580
possible and you're freezing your dick 
off.

2202
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:17,440
You don't have to.
It doesn't even have to be that cold for

2203
01:34:17,441 --> 01:34:18,760
you to freeze.
Right?

2204
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:21,150
If you're trying not to move,
yeah,

2205
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,770
it can be in the fifties and you'd be 
freezing your balls off.

2206
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,520
Right?
Because you're not moving so your body's

2207
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,000
not generating heat.
But I've hunted when it's like,

2208
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:28,973
you know,
eight degrees or 10 degrees in eastern 

2209
01:34:29,951 --> 01:34:32,950
Colorado and I was okay because I could 
move.

2210
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,490
You know that you're taking layers off 
if you're going up hills.

2211
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:37,383
Right?
Like that is one of the things that's 

2212
01:34:38,351 --> 01:34:39,184
really interesting to me about hunting 
and cold weather is the whole layering 

2213
01:34:42,131 --> 01:34:46,450
system is that you have to really be 
aware of when you're sweating.

2214
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:50,980
So the whole key is to get yourself to 
the point where you're never sweating so

2215
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:51,814
as your mood,
because if you're sweating and then you 

2216
01:34:52,781 --> 01:34:54,730
have to cool off and then you have to 
sweat,

2217
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:58,040
it kills herself up.
Your clothes are wet from

2218
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,060
sweat,
you're fucked.

2219
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,050
Yeah,
you know,

2220
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:00,913
that's one of the beautiful things about
wool is that will allow you to retain 

2221
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:05,420
your body heat,
even if it's wet,

2222
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:06,320
you know,
he doesn't,

2223
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,153
doesn't really fuck with you the same 
way that a lot of synthetics and 

2224
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:12,170
particularly cotton cotton's the worse.
Yeah.

2225
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,880
Synthetics are good because they,
it,

2226
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:14,840
they,
they'll,

2227
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:16,180
they'll dry quickly.
Yeah,

2228
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,270
yeah,
yeah.

2229
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,373
Have you ever seen that rewarming drill 
that John Barklow from Sitka did where 

2230
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:26,651
he jumps in a river with wet clothes and
chose how to heat your body back up now.

2231
01:35:27,141 --> 01:35:27,974
But I just did a hunt with a um,
I just had a hunt with John Hart from 

2232
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,420
Sitka.
Yeah.

2233
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,010
Yeah.
He's a great guy.

2234
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,873
He's a great guy.
He was a lot of fun hunting with and we 

2235
01:35:42,261 --> 01:35:44,660
talked about survival stuff a bit like,
you know,

2236
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:45,494
stuff like that.
Like what do you do if you fall in a 

2237
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:47,354
river and it's cold.
That guy who attend me is like one of 

2238
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:51,530
the,
I mean because he owns the company.

2239
01:35:51,531 --> 01:35:52,364
He's one of the best representations of 
what you would want from a guy who owns 

2240
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:57,403
a big company,
who was a ceo of a big company that's 

2241
01:35:59,241 --> 01:36:01,280
involved in hunting.
Super Smart,

2242
01:36:01,281 --> 01:36:04,850
really articulate conservation minded,
very ethical,

2243
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,010
just solid,
super solid.

2244
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,780
I was with him in Utah.
Yeah.

2245
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,190
Great Guy.
Yeah.

2246
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,450
Awesome company too.
I know you're a good stuff.

2247
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:15,310
Yeah.
There's,

2248
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,010
there's,
there's,

2249
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:16,341
you know,
I mean,

2250
01:36:16,341 --> 01:36:18,530
there's a lot of good stuff out there,
but I just,

2251
01:36:18,531 --> 01:36:19,250
uh,
yeah.

2252
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:19,910
I'm,
I'm,

2253
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:23,460
I'm hoping I stay warm on this,
on his hunt in BC.

2254
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:26,360
Where were you guys were in Hawaii.
Oh,

2255
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:27,530
that's right.
That's right.

2256
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:28,364
I was thinking you were in that Moose 
hunt that they just come back from 

2257
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,040
China.
We're hunting in Hawaii.

2258
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:34,460
So you were in that crazy ranch.
That's somewhere on the big island.

2259
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:35,480
The people never hunt,
right?

2260
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,910
Um,
some big area.

2261
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:39,590
Yeah,
we were,

2262
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,660
we were hunting on the big island.
Um,

2263
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,440
we're hunting pigs.
It,

2264
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:46,880
I was,
I was hunting in an area that was like,

2265
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,190
um,
I explain it.

2266
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:49,491
We're,
yeah,

2267
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:50,324
we're,
we're hunting these big bars on the big 

2268
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:53,190
island.
And uh,

2269
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:54,860
it was a lot of fun.
It was great.

2270
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:55,580
But he's a,
he's,

2271
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,290
he's a really good dude.
Yeah.

2272
01:36:57,291 --> 01:37:00,950
Did they have like numbers that they 
have to keep the pigs down to,

2273
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,080
do they have like a point where the pigs
reach?

2274
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:04,063
Because for people who don't know,
it really does have several litters a 

2275
01:37:06,021 --> 01:37:10,340
year and if they're not because there's 
no predators on Hawaii.

2276
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,830
So if the pigs aren't kept in check by 
people,

2277
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:13,693
they'll get completely out of hand.
So do they have wildlife biologists who 

2278
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:20,480
manage the numbers and try to decide 
like what to do?

2279
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:21,343
They just try and kill as many as again.
So they just have people hunt 

2280
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,593
constantly.
Yeah.

2281
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,360
And is it not a problem because so many 
people hunt there?

2282
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:29,930
I mean it just sorta depends who you 
ask.

2283
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:30,860
It's,
it's,

2284
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:31,693
it's crazy because like with the pigs,
the pigs can thrive and really thick 

2285
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:36,733
areas.
So there is very difficult to do like a 

2286
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,790
to figure out how many pigs there are.

2287
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:43,400
Like if you try and count the number of 
deer on Maui,

2288
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,110
people count them.
My friend Jake does it,

2289
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:49,250
he'll fly in the grid and they'll get a 
pretty darn accurate reading of how many

2290
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:50,084
deer on the island,
but try and figure out how many pigs on 

2291
01:37:51,801 --> 01:37:53,660
the big island.
It's impossible.

2292
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,040
They live in the jungle,
right?

2293
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:57,820
Because they're all in underbrush.
They.

2294
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:59,311
Yeah.
But the deer,

2295
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:00,480
they come out in the open,
you know,

2296
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:03,030
and you chased him with a,
with a helicopter and you can see them.

2297
01:38:03,031 --> 01:38:04,440
They're all running pigs.
Don't do that.

2298
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:08,910
Just go right into the thick.
So basically there's infinite numbers of

2299
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:12,690
pigs on the big island.
So do they also have sheep?

2300
01:38:12,691 --> 01:38:14,080
We have,
we have moved on sheet.

2301
01:38:14,081 --> 01:38:16,050
We have like a,
like a hybrid sheep.

2302
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:18,710
We have um,
we got goats and,

2303
01:38:18,711 --> 01:38:21,690
and those you can,
you can get numbers of and you can knock

2304
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:23,490
them down really quick if you're trying 
to eradicate them.

2305
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,260
Pigs.
It's really difficult.

2306
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:28,170
How did the move launch?
Cheap taste move on.

2307
01:38:28,171 --> 01:38:29,004
Cheaper.
Amazing.

2308
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,030
Yeah,
that's what I've heard.

2309
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:32,890
They're really fantastic.
They're great to hunt.

2310
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,433
Did you see that controversy that 
happened pretty recently where a woman 

2311
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:40,770
shot a shot,
a wild sheep?

2312
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,453
I did one year up goat Europe in Europe 
and people were upset at her and all 

2313
01:38:47,341 --> 01:38:49,920
these Ricky Gervais',
of course he has to jump in.

2314
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:52,860
That's his favorite thing.
Glenn Greenwald,

2315
01:38:52,861 --> 01:38:53,694
all these people jumped in.
What would they don't understand is 

2316
01:38:55,541 --> 01:39:00,541
these wild goats are invasive species.
They have no natural predators and they.

2317
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:05,340
They hunt them to preserve the wildlife.
That's indicative,

2318
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:10,380
that's native to the area.
Whether it's the plant life,

2319
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:12,420
animal life,
I mean these,

2320
01:39:12,421 --> 01:39:15,510
these goats,
if their populations are left unchecked,

2321
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,240
they hunt them for a very specific 
reason,

2322
01:39:18,241 --> 01:39:19,074
like really.
Have you talked to some wildlife 

2323
01:39:20,401 --> 01:39:21,234
biologists?
They should be eradicated because there 

2324
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:23,640
are.

2325
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:24,473
A lot of them were left on islands.
People don't realize this by whalers 

2326
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:30,243
the.
They left them on these islands because 

2327
01:39:31,441 --> 01:39:32,274
this was an island off of a,
I believe it was off of Ireland or 

2328
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:36,840
Scotland.
See if you can find that story.

2329
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:37,703
Scotland,
a lot of them are left there by by 

2330
01:39:40,051 --> 01:39:43,260
travelers so that they would have food 
there when they came back,

2331
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,393
so they would drop these things off on 
these certain islands and in fact there 

2332
01:39:47,701 --> 01:39:51,300
was a real area,
a real problem where they drop them off,

2333
01:39:51,301 --> 01:39:52,134
so this was the woman and people got all
over this lady for shooting this wild 

2334
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:56,154
goat,
which is really kind of crazy because 

2335
01:39:56,941 --> 01:39:58,830
they eat them,
they're delicious.

2336
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:01,200
They either have his food,
they're invasive.

2337
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:02,173
I mean there's so many things going in 
in toe pointing towards the direction 

2338
01:40:06,661 --> 01:40:10,290
that this was actually a smart 
conservation thing to do,

2339
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:14,490
but I guess maybe it was because of the 
way she talked about it.

2340
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:16,213
No,
because she said it was a really fun 

2341
01:40:16,981 --> 01:40:19,800
hunt or something like that,
but like I get it,

2342
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:21,023
it's like a,
it's like a beautiful creature and it 

2343
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,630
would have still been alive if she 
wasn't there.

2344
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:28,290
So that perspective of people just like,
you know why you got to kill it?

2345
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,020
It's,
it's,

2346
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:29,853
it's a,
it's a,

2347
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:31,290
it's,
it's a wild animal.

2348
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,300
Living on an island,
you can't just let them live.

2349
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,193
It's a natural perspective.
It's as simple as that normal human 

2350
01:40:36,301 --> 01:40:37,134
nature to think that,
but you know all the people who think 

2351
01:40:40,381 --> 01:40:41,214
that if you dig a little deeper,
there's a lot more information there 

2352
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:43,733
with those.
You just can't let those go to get out 

2353
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:46,020
of hand.
There was hardy as hell.

2354
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:49,400
They don't die,
but that's the problem with Greg.

2355
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:56,470
I'm Ricky Gervais' or Glenn Greenwald,
someone like that,

2356
01:40:56,471 --> 01:40:57,304
that has a giant platform that loves 
animals and I appreciate that and that 

2357
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,193
instantly post something like this,
very inflammatory without looking into 

2358
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,184
it deeper.
They use their platform and they think 

2359
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:10,330
to expose something they think is 
horrific,

2360
01:41:10,331 --> 01:41:12,280
but they don't understand what's going 
on behind the scenes of this.

2361
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:13,503
There's a thing called Judas goats,
and what they do is they'll take a goat 

2362
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:17,733
and they'll noodle that goat and put a 
gps tag on it and send it out because 

2363
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:22,243
goats always flock together in this goat
will go near the other goats and then 

2364
01:41:26,021 --> 01:41:26,854
they fly over with helicopters and gun 
these goats down and this is just to 

2365
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:33,620
keep goat populations in check so they 
kill every goal,

2366
01:41:33,621 --> 01:41:35,810
but the Judas Goat and then the Judas 
go,

2367
01:41:35,811 --> 01:41:36,644
we'll find other goats and then they fly
over again and gone all the goats down 

2368
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:43,330
and this is done by wildlife biologist,
right by my house.

2369
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:47,650
They do this just because those goats 
eat everything.

2370
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,513
I have a friend who lives in Topanga and
they bought goats to clean their 

2371
01:41:50,891 --> 01:41:52,180
property.
They thought,

2372
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:53,380
oh,
this would be a good idea.

2373
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:54,363
We'll bring these goats in and they'll 
eat all the weeds and they'll know they 

2374
01:41:56,501 --> 01:41:57,460
eat everything.
Everything.

2375
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:58,323
Every last thing they keep going and 
still they'll decimate local wildlife 

2376
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:03,063
like whatever their their habitat is.
They'll devastate all these local 

2377
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:07,054
plants.
I mean things that are supposed to be 

2378
01:42:09,161 --> 01:42:12,130
there that have been there forever.
When these invasive species get there,

2379
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,113
they have a really hard time maintaining
and then it gets to a point where they 

2380
01:42:16,871 --> 01:42:18,280
have to do something about it.
Well,

2381
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:21,460
this,
this woman paid to do that so that money

2382
01:42:21,461 --> 01:42:24,100
goes towards conservation.
She gets to eat the meat,

2383
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:25,173
you know,
she has this enjoyable experience 

2384
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:30,670
hunting these things in the mountains,
but people don't want to look at that.

2385
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:32,470
They just want to look at it.
It shouldn't die,

2386
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,443
and it's really particularly crazy when 
it's a guy like Ricky Gervais' who eats 

2387
01:42:35,831 --> 01:42:36,950
meat.
Yeah,

2388
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,430
so like the whole thing is just.
It's so strange.

2389
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:40,293
It's just so strange that people refuse 
to look deeper into these things and 

2390
01:42:43,811 --> 01:42:44,644
they immediately have these knee jerk 
reactions where they want to complain 

2391
01:42:46,931 --> 01:42:47,764
about it and do so publicly in a way 
that gets all these people to attack 

2392
01:42:50,741 --> 01:42:51,431
this woman.
Well,

2393
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:54,080
the photo of that dead animal,
that's what.

2394
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:56,650
That's what initiates that,
that response,

2395
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:02,160
emotional response.
That gets smiling and then they'll go to

2396
01:43:02,861 --> 01:43:07,600
the fridge and grab some steak and cook 
it and think nothing of it.

2397
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:10,030
Nothing at all of that meat is.
They don't.

2398
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:10,893
They don't see the parallel there,
they just think that it's completely 

2399
01:43:13,151 --> 01:43:15,220
different than weird that someone wants 
to go hunt them.

2400
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:19,330
Yeah,
it's fucked up in this weird accepted,

2401
01:43:19,331 --> 01:43:20,260
hypocritical way.

2402
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:22,180
I mean it's,
it's oddly accepted,

2403
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,253
but we all have freezers full of the 
best meat there is and eat it every 

2404
01:43:26,081 --> 01:43:28,180
night and it's amazing.
I'm never going to stop.

2405
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,260
We do.
Yeah.

2406
01:43:29,261 --> 01:43:31,300
We that hunt.
We do that.

2407
01:43:31,301 --> 01:43:32,920
We actually have that connection with 
that meat.

2408
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:34,630
We killed it.
We skinned it,

2409
01:43:34,631 --> 01:43:35,770
we got the meat,
we de-bone it.

2410
01:43:35,771 --> 01:43:36,604
We packed it out.
We packaged it and put it in our 

2411
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:39,840
freezers ourselves.
But this is the first step.

2412
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:40,713
Second.
Awesome.

2413
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:41,683
It's the first ever seen someone get 
attacked at something that's immediate 

2414
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:45,970
animal because a,
I've seen people,

2415
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,620
maybe they don't know what's a meat 
animal,

2416
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:48,573
but I've seen people get attacked for 
obviously for anything like that it's 

2417
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:52,340
appliance

2418
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:55,250
and yeah,
the Predator one is the biggest one I'll

2419
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:56,720
give you.
Kill something that's a predator.

2420
01:43:56,721 --> 01:43:59,690
People for whatever weird reason,
freak out more than anything.

2421
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:01,980
Well,
and if there's any,

2422
01:44:01,981 --> 01:44:03,260
if there's like a,
like a,

2423
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:04,123
like a,
like a general idea that they're 

2424
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,890
endangered.
Right.

2425
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,873
You know what I mean?
Like everybody thinks that lions are 

2426
01:44:08,841 --> 01:44:09,674
endangered or elephants are endangered 
or even bear bears are embarrassed or 

2427
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:13,900
danger.
Yeah.

2428
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:14,980
So,
um,

2429
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:16,273
yeah,
there's a lot of misconceptions out 

2430
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:17,684
there for sure.
But I don't really eat lions or 

2431
01:44:20,121 --> 01:44:21,770
elephants or.
And like that idea.

2432
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,810
And there's millions of deer.
Millions.

2433
01:44:24,410 --> 01:44:25,220
Yeah.
Literally.

2434
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,053
Yeah.
I mean where we hunt in Lanai has 3000 

2435
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:32,540
people more.
They estimate somewhere over 20,000

2436
01:44:32,541 --> 01:44:36,130
deer and they don't even know.
I mean it's just an Nana's.

2437
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:39,400
I'm on a text thread with,
with Benny O'Brian and Rennie and,

2438
01:44:39,670 --> 01:44:41,030
and I'll and all you guys.

2439
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:43,460
And there was a stat that they were 
saying yesterday,

2440
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:47,150
I don't know if you're on that text and 
they were saying that like in one of the

2441
01:44:47,151 --> 01:44:48,860
Midwest states,
I don't know which one it was.

2442
01:44:48,861 --> 01:44:51,680
Do you remember in one of the Midwest 
states,

2443
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:52,903
like 850,000
deer die during gun season and half of 

2444
01:44:57,201 --> 01:45:00,530
them like 400,000
deer die in the first two days because.

2445
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:02,450
Because we were talking about Adam being
in the tree.

2446
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:05,240
That's crazy.
In one state alone,

2447
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:07,730
850,000
deer die during gun season.

2448
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:08,993
So you think of how many deer that is.
Imagine if no one hunted for like three 

2449
01:45:11,031 --> 01:45:13,040
years.
What was that stat?

2450
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:18,070
How many deer there would be the number 
of car accidents nationwide with dear?

2451
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,970
I think it's a million and a half.
I mean,

2452
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:24,103
but the people who get angry at the 
photos don't think of what it would be 

2453
01:45:26,961 --> 01:45:28,490
like if you just stopped hunting.

2454
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:29,563
Yeah.
No.

2455
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:34,660
How many goats Arab he imagined,
dear nature would sort itself out.

2456
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,160
It wouldn't.
Well,

2457
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:38,030
it would eventually be.
You'd have to bring in wolves.

2458
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,240
If you're comfortable with wolves,
eat and your kids.

2459
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,353
I mean that's what it is.
Yours and all that big bad wolf shit 

2460
01:45:43,251 --> 01:45:45,230
from when we're little kids like little 
pig,

2461
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:46,160
little pig.
Let me in.

2462
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,890
That's because wolves were everywhere 
and they were bad.

2463
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:52,880
It was dangerous.
Like you would go through people's kids.

2464
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,140
That really did happen.
Yeah.

2465
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:57,800
We just.
We've got so far away from that.

2466
01:45:57,801 --> 01:46:01,340
We forgot about it as a possibility,
so now we think of them as dogs that are

2467
01:46:01,341 --> 01:46:02,174
living their natural,
that dogs just living his best life out 

2468
01:46:04,881 --> 01:46:07,420
in the woods.
How other one,

2469
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:08,750
they howl,
they're trying,

2470
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:10,190
they're trying to figure out how to eat 
you.

2471
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:11,183
They want to get through your house,
which they're trying to figure out how 

2472
01:46:12,801 --> 01:46:15,560
to eat your kids and if you reintroduce 
them into yellow stone,

2473
01:46:15,561 --> 01:46:16,700
they're never going to leave 
yellowstone.

2474
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,833
You're going to stay there.
They're going to stay right in this 

2475
01:46:18,891 --> 01:46:21,530
little pocket of where they like to 
live.

2476
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:23,960
They're never going to reproduce into 
like thousands.

2477
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:26,870
Yeah,
there are those people think,

2478
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:29,560
but really they're going to just start 
roaming and.

2479
01:46:29,561 --> 01:46:31,940
Yeah,
and recreating thousands,

2480
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:32,833
thousands and thousands of walls that 
are all going to go into neighborhoods 

2481
01:46:34,941 --> 01:46:38,570
eventually when that's what's happening.
That's what's happening in Montana.

2482
01:46:38,571 --> 01:46:40,160
That's what's happening in Idaho.
Yeah.

2483
01:46:40,290 --> 01:46:41,123
I mean,
these are all reintroduced wolves that 

2484
01:46:41,931 --> 01:46:42,764
are mean and they also go on the surplus
kills or they'll kill like 15 elk and 

2485
01:46:46,461 --> 01:46:48,650
just leave them there and they just go 
nutty.

2486
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:49,920
Yeah,
that's what they do.

2487
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,873
My friend lives in Montana and he was 
telling me that the wolf population is 

2488
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:55,134
so out of hand that the,
that the elk population has been 

2489
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:58,920
decimated.
It was,

2490
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:01,530
it's down by like 80 percent or some 
crazy stat.

2491
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,310
Crazy though.
Yeah.

2492
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,263
They weren't there in 1994.
I mean that's when they reintroduced 

2493
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:09,750
them right.
In the nineties.

2494
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:10,603
So Yah,
I mean there's,

2495
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,513
there's,
I mean now that I mean now that human 

2496
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:17,124
population is,
is so established and a lot of these 

2497
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:22,080
areas and you can't just reintroduce 
wolves with no plan to keep,

2498
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:23,100
keep a lid on it.
Well,

2499
01:47:23,101 --> 01:47:23,934
there is a plan,
but the problem with the plan is the 

2500
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:26,694
established numbers that they needed to 
achieve in before they start managing 

2501
01:47:29,701 --> 01:47:30,534
the population than there was immediate 
lawsuits by animal rights activists who 

2502
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:35,390
don't want them to ever hunt wolves.
Right.

2503
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:37,800
So in Montana they've opened up seasons.

2504
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,010
They've opened up seasons in Idaho,
they've opened up seasons for wolves and

2505
01:47:41,011 --> 01:47:43,470
they would like to do the same for 
grizzly bears and all of these areas,

2506
01:47:43,471 --> 01:47:45,090
and there's a lot of pushback on that 
too,

2507
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:48,090
but it's the same sort of thing,
the established numbers that they needed

2508
01:47:48,091 --> 01:47:48,924
to achieve in order to make it a 
sustainable population they've been 

2509
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:53,730
reached and then the wildlife 
biologists,

2510
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:55,590
the ones are objective about are saying,
hey,

2511
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:56,633
we need to keep these populations in 
check in order to keep the deer 

2512
01:47:58,621 --> 01:47:59,454
populations healthy and the Moose 
populations healthy because these bears 

2513
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:04,830
and these wolves,
they're just destroying these calves and

2514
01:48:04,831 --> 01:48:07,920
they just run around and the populations
of these animals go way down.

2515
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:12,600
Now there's also an argument and a 
really good one that you need predators,

2516
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:17,990
and this good argument is you don't ever
want to be recreated in Montana,

2517
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:18,690
right?

2518
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:22,020
Where there's just these deer and these 
elk.

2519
01:48:22,290 --> 01:48:23,123
You want a certain natural balance,
and so there's an argument that there 

2520
01:48:25,951 --> 01:48:29,340
should be a certain amount of wolves,
and I agree with that argument.

2521
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:30,383
I agree too,
but the balance can be really difficult 

2522
01:48:31,831 --> 01:48:32,760
to maintain.
Yeah,

2523
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:33,623
that's.
That's my point is like if there's too 

2524
01:48:35,011 --> 01:48:36,900
many elk and you want to control that 
number,

2525
01:48:36,930 --> 01:48:39,480
say there's $100,000,
but there should only be $50,000.

2526
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,740
That's,
that's the perfect number.

2527
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:43,760
It's actually pretty easy to go from 
100,000

2528
01:48:43,761 --> 01:48:44,760
and 50,000
to trial.

2529
01:48:44,761 --> 01:48:48,510
That elk herd back pretty easy through 
through management and through hunting.

2530
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:49,643
Same with deer.
You can pull that number back pretty 

2531
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:53,760
quick.
Wolves are fricking hard to kill,

2532
01:48:53,761 --> 01:48:54,570
Dude.
Yeah.

2533
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:57,330
You had to kill a wolf and you had a 
gun.

2534
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,513
Fricking hard real.
If you had to kill a deer and you had a 

2535
01:49:01,171 --> 01:49:02,220
gun,
not that hard.

2536
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:05,730
You can find deer.
Finding a wolf is freaking hard,

2537
01:49:05,731 --> 01:49:06,920
dude.
So once those.

2538
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:10,500
What my point is is once those wolf 
numbers get out of hand,

2539
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,620
trying to manage that population,
the wolf population is very,

2540
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:14,454
very difficult.
We'll places that are used to dealing 

2541
01:49:16,231 --> 01:49:17,820
with them.
They know what the fuck to do.

2542
01:49:17,821 --> 01:49:20,450
Like Alaska he had to them and 
everything and trap them.

2543
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:23,190
They fly around and planes and shoot 
them out of the,

2544
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:26,760
out of the air with helicopters.
I mean they eradicate them.

2545
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,000
And then that Sarah Palin,
I don't think she's doing that anymore,

2546
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,073
but there's a lot of people up there 
that do do that and you can buy wolf 

2547
01:49:34,201 --> 01:49:35,640
skin rugs that they,
they,

2548
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:36,683
they sell those skins and turn them into
rugs and do all sorts of different 

2549
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:41,280
things with the pelts.
Got To do something.

2550
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,540
Yeah,
they do something with it.

2551
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:43,373
So it's.
But they do that because they have a 

2552
01:49:46,321 --> 01:49:47,154
vested interest in keeping the 
population of their game animals alive 

2553
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,870
for a couple reasons.
And there's criticism about that too,

2554
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:56,140
that they may be killed too many wolves 
because they don't.

2555
01:49:56,310 --> 01:50:00,460
They want you to be able to go there.
And a lot of their tourism dollars comes

2556
01:50:00,461 --> 01:50:01,294
from people that fly in to hunt.
Moose are flying to hunt deer and they 

2557
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:06,460
want to make sure they keep certain 
populations of them there.

2558
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,230
So it's,
it's all,

2559
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:09,213
there's a real problem when you get 
emotions and you have those emotions 

2560
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:16,300
tied into this idea of wildlife biology 
and what an animal is,

2561
01:50:16,301 --> 01:50:20,890
and keeping healthy numbers of these 
animals in a certain area that's a real,

2562
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:22,700
becomes a real issue,
you know?

2563
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:26,560
And that's why when this goat thing 
happens and everybody freaks out over,

2564
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:30,100
it's like you should probably educate 
yourself as to what you're talking about

2565
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:30,934
before you start complaining because he 
just throwing gasoline on this fire and 

2566
01:50:34,511 --> 01:50:37,720
you don't necessarily understand all the
circumstances involved.

2567
01:50:37,950 --> 01:50:39,200
Let's go there.
Not only to because it,

2568
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:42,730
because they live where I live and they 
on,

2569
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:47,320
they love shorelines and they love like 
ridges and berms and stuff like that.

2570
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:48,154
And they're,
they're,

2571
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:50,650
they're,
they create so much erosion because they

2572
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:53,200
love those edges on,
on cliffs and stuff.

2573
01:50:53,201 --> 01:50:56,010
And so they,
they ran all the berms that original.

2574
01:50:56,130 --> 01:50:56,963
They,
they ruin all the cliffs and then 

2575
01:50:58,061 --> 01:51:01,510
there's all this runoff and erosion and 
they,

2576
01:51:01,511 --> 01:51:04,150
I mean they completely decimate all the 
grass,

2577
01:51:04,151 --> 01:51:05,320
all the weeds,
all the way down.

2578
01:51:05,321 --> 01:51:06,640
They don't,
they don't just trim things,

2579
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:08,110
they're not,
they're not selective eaters.

2580
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,700
They'll just chow down all the way to 
the,

2581
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,500
to the roots and then eat the roots.
Also,

2582
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,450
there's nothing holding that dirt in 
place.

2583
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:14,613
So when it rains,
just everything spills downhill because 

2584
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:17,260
of the goats.
They really.

2585
01:51:17,261 --> 01:51:18,100
I see,
I see it.

2586
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,660
And with deer,
you can see some,

2587
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:24,040
some impact that they have for sure as 
you let those numbers get out of hand,

2588
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:27,040
they have the same effect,
but goats go through radical.

2589
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,960
They,
the populations explode and,

2590
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:32,590
and if,
if someone's not managing them,

2591
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:34,570
that you can see the impact that they 
have on the land

2592
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:38,280
and that'll have an impact on all the 
native species to all the ground nesting

2593
01:51:38,281 --> 01:51:40,140
birds,
all the animals that use that,

2594
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:44,790
those,
the grass and those different things for

2595
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,760
cover and for life.
Yeah.

2596
01:51:46,761 --> 01:51:47,700
It's a.
and what they,

2597
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:50,550
the things that they feed off of all 
this stuff gets eaten by the goats,

2598
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:51,190
you know?
Yeah.

2599
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:52,900
If there's a large population of goat 
somewhere,

2600
01:51:52,901 --> 01:51:53,850
you'll know it.
Yeah.

2601
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:56,200
That was like almost nothing left.

2602
01:51:57,530 --> 01:52:00,020
Appreciate these people like Glenn 
Greenwald.

2603
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:01,970
I appreciate the sentiment behind it.
Uh,

2604
01:52:01,971 --> 01:52:02,804
really do.
I just wish they would look into it a 

2605
01:52:03,891 --> 01:52:06,950
little bit deeper and you know,
this woman's not bad person.

2606
01:52:06,951 --> 01:52:08,690
She's just,
that's how she gets her meat,

2607
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:10,860
you know?
Yup.

2608
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:12,283
Like I said,
especially a guy like ricky who I've 

2609
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:13,510
met,
I've,

2610
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:14,343
I've actually talked about hunting with 
him on a radio show before on the open 

2611
01:52:18,441 --> 01:52:19,274
anthony show.
I had explained to him that I'm a 

2612
01:52:20,151 --> 01:52:23,000
hunter.
I hunt animals and I eat them because he

2613
01:52:23,001 --> 01:52:23,834
was talking about hunters and I and he 
was actually very friendly with me and 

2614
01:52:27,081 --> 01:52:28,280
we were cool about it.
We had a good.

2615
01:52:28,430 --> 01:52:29,580
He's like,
as long as you eat it,

2616
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:30,980
that's what you're doing it for.
I'm like,

2617
01:52:30,981 --> 01:52:33,710
that's exactly what I do at four.
But he eats me too.

2618
01:52:33,711 --> 01:52:35,450
Which is so the whole.
It's weird.

2619
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:36,661
It's the,
the,

2620
01:52:36,661 --> 01:52:37,494
the,
the fact that people think like that 

2621
01:52:39,681 --> 01:52:40,514
they are morally disconnected from the 
act of killing an animal just because 

2622
01:52:43,941 --> 01:52:46,250
they use a credit card to buy is so 
hilarious.

2623
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:49,280
But you hired a supermarket Hitman,
that's what you did.

2624
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:52,730
Supermarket Hitman took a prisoner and a
prisoner,

2625
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:56,180
you know,
cow and fucking put a bolt through.

2626
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:57,200
It said.
And you feel.

2627
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:59,390
You feel completely detached from it.
Yup.

2628
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:01,430
No Karma.
Well,

2629
01:53:01,431 --> 01:53:02,264
and when someone needs a hamburger,
they think nothing of eating a quarter 

2630
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:05,990
of it or half a mil.
I'm really full.

2631
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:07,290
He can just take that away from me.
Yeah.

2632
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,640
You'd never do that with your elk do?
No,

2633
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,680
no,
I eat it all it all.

2634
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:13,490
Yeah.
I'm making sure that if I cook it,

2635
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:17,510
I Cook enough so that me and my family 
eat it and whatever's leftover,

2636
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,050
uh,
no.

2637
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:20,140
I'll eat in the morning or eat the next 
day for lunch.

2638
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:21,083
Huge difference is you have so much 
respect for that meet and for that 

2639
01:53:24,321 --> 01:53:25,154
animal because all the effort it took 
and you watch that thing live in the 

2640
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:28,070
wild.

2641
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:31,340
You have a completely different 
perspective of that meat then you do.

2642
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:32,740
If you just,
you know,

2643
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:35,520
order a hamburger at that restaurant,
you know?

2644
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,010
Yeah,
for sure.

2645
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:38,870
Yeah.
But that,

2646
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:40,340
again,
that's one of those,

2647
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:41,203
I mean,
you and I have developed this 

2648
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:42,914
perspective from years of,
of hunting and being around people hunt 

2649
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:46,934
and we understand it for the average 
person that's never going to encounter 

2650
01:53:50,181 --> 01:53:51,860
that in their entire life.
Now it's,

2651
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:56,270
we've developed this very weird society.
We have insulated people from all of the

2652
01:53:56,271 --> 01:53:59,930
ugly realities of eating meat and of 
wearing leather.

2653
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,460
I mean,
we're sitting on leather chairs.

2654
01:54:01,461 --> 01:54:03,980
Didn't think about it once.
This used to be a fucking cow.

2655
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:04,853
Yeah,
it's some a shot this cow and turns it 

2656
01:54:06,471 --> 01:54:07,304
into a nice chair.
No one minds sitting on a cow that's 

2657
01:54:10,311 --> 01:54:11,144
dead,
but no one wants to see that dead cow 

2658
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,033
laying on the ground.

2659
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,860
The eyes open and blood hanging from his
ankles people,

2660
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:19,970
and I think it's important for people to
see that.

2661
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,340
I mean,
my kids have seen a lot of dead animals.

2662
01:54:23,410 --> 01:54:25,160
It's not sad.
It's a little sad,

2663
01:54:25,161 --> 01:54:27,020
but it's not like they don't think of it
as sad.

2664
01:54:27,021 --> 01:54:30,560
They think of it as just like a part of 
life and that's what we eat.

2665
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:34,160
Yeah.
Dad brings a deer home in a cooler.

2666
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:37,310
Dad brings a pig home in the front of 
the quad with his bow,

2667
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,530
with a buddy earl.
It's totally normal.

2668
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:40,423
They see me drag it off the quad and 
shoot down with the hose and quarter it 

2669
01:54:43,391 --> 01:54:44,224
and debone it and,
and they help me package it and grind 

2670
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:49,700
immedion's totally normal to them it 
should be normal,

2671
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:53,000
but there's a connection between the 
death and what we're eating,

2672
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:56,060
which a lot of people just don't have.
And I love that.

2673
01:54:56,061 --> 01:54:58,040
That to my kids already have that.
It's a good thing.

2674
01:54:58,041 --> 01:54:58,880
I think.
Well,

2675
01:54:58,881 --> 01:54:59,714
I,
I think that we have a real problem in 

2676
01:55:00,921 --> 01:55:01,754
this society where so many people,
somewhere in the neighborhood of 95 to 

2677
01:55:04,491 --> 01:55:05,324
97 percent of the people you meet and 
the number of people that have actually 

2678
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:09,170
seen animal die.
It's like,

2679
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:11,690
you know,
two or three like what is the,

2680
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,810
what's the population of people that 
hunt in North America?

2681
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:19,100
Let's just guess,
guess the prop population of the US that

2682
01:55:19,101 --> 01:55:20,840
hunts.
I'm going to say it's

2683
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:25,070
three percent that,
that might be high.

2684
01:55:25,071 --> 01:55:27,770
Even three out of 100.
What do you think it is?

2685
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:31,640
It's probably less than three for sure.
Let's see what it is.

2686
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:34,383
What population of the United States of 
America hunts Jamie's raising his 

2687
01:55:37,421 --> 01:55:39,100
eyebrows,
right?

2688
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:43,110
It might be it set on technicality here,
but it says there's 100,

2689
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,670
one point 6 million

2690
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:48,890
Americans that have participated 16 and 
older that uh,

2691
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:49,733
yeah.
Fishing fish and wildlife shows that 

2692
01:55:51,331 --> 01:55:52,370
100,
$100.

2693
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:55,110
A lot of people behind you.
But that must have painted.

2694
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:56,053
Yeah.
Participated in wildlife related 

2695
01:55:56,851 --> 01:55:58,350
activities.
Oh Wow.

2696
01:55:58,351 --> 01:55:59,380
That's really,
that's,

2697
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:02,160
that includes like pig fuck.
That includes wildlife watching.

2698
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:04,310
Oh,
wildlife watch it.

2699
01:56:04,311 --> 01:56:06,620
And I typed in popular.
That's definitely a lot of difference.

2700
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:08,770
That's a lot different.
Um,

2701
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:10,260
does,
that's all they came up.

2702
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:13,000
There's got to be a population of actual
number of hunters.

2703
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:14,040
I mean this is back in.

2704
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:17,250
That's the other thing too,
is like there's a hierarchy,

2705
01:56:17,251 --> 01:56:19,080
like people don't have a problem with 
people fishing.

2706
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:20,460
No,
no,

2707
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:21,323
no problem.
Or posting a photo with their fishing 

2708
01:56:22,951 --> 01:56:24,030
pole and catch.
Yeah.

2709
01:56:24,031 --> 01:56:25,020
Hey,
you got some food.

2710
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:25,854
What's different between that present?
Maybe that's what's the difference 

2711
01:56:28,951 --> 01:56:30,780
between now and a deer,
but here's,

2712
01:56:30,781 --> 01:56:32,940
there's a warm,
here's the will.

2713
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:35,990
They're warm and they have for a movie 
made about them.

2714
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,200
Uh,
they talk.

2715
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,150
What about Nemos fuck.
Nimo.

2716
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:44,180
Nobody cares about finding nemo gets no 
love.

2717
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,800
He doesn't get any less.
I was thinking of this though,

2718
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:47,550
like,
you know,

2719
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:49,470
because I have kids and my kids eat 
meat.

2720
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:50,633
Right?
And I feel like imagine if you made a 

2721
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:54,960
law that after the age of 16 years old 
in America,

2722
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:56,700
if you want her to eat another 
hamburger,

2723
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:59,010
you had to kill two hours to two 
animals.

2724
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:02,730
Like,
like you can go to a place like whatever

2725
01:57:02,731 --> 01:57:03,564
it is,
like a of a ranch where they processed 

2726
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:07,890
me and there's a cow there and there's a
rifle there and you go,

2727
01:57:07,891 --> 01:57:08,724
okay,
if you want to be a meat eater from now 

2728
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:10,980
on,
from their 60th birthday on,

2729
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:15,000
the only way to eat meat in the future 
is if you got to do it yourself at least

2730
01:57:15,001 --> 01:57:15,390
twice.

2731
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:17,250
Can't just do it once now.
Kill a cow,

2732
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:18,690
watch,
get processed,

2733
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,210
and then you got to,
you got to wait like a month or whatever

2734
01:57:21,211 --> 01:57:23,640
it is and go back and take another 
animal's life.

2735
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:26,160
And then you earn the right to eat meat 
the rest of your life.

2736
01:57:26,161 --> 01:57:28,530
Imagine how many people wouldn't be able
to do that.

2737
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:29,933
They're happy to eat meat,
but there's that disconnection with the 

2738
01:57:32,011 --> 01:57:32,970
actual death part

2739
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:35,503
problem with forcing people to do it.
Just like got to have a problem with 

2740
01:57:37,671 --> 01:57:42,671
forcing people to think people should be
forced to get rid of their garbage.

2741
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:45,290
It's just a wild concept that it is an 
interesting concept,

2742
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:50,120
but I think there's services like,
like taking your garbage and bring it to

2743
01:57:50,121 --> 01:57:50,954
the garbage dump.
I don't think you should have to go to 

2744
01:57:53,541 --> 01:57:56,510
the garbage dump,
go to the landfill and drop your garbage

2745
01:57:56,511 --> 01:57:57,370
off.
I'm,

2746
01:57:57,371 --> 01:57:58,204
I'm happy that there's someone that gets
paid to pick up the bins and dumped the 

2747
01:58:01,461 --> 01:58:02,294
garbage into the garbage truck and then 
drive it to the bit that I'm happy that 

2748
01:58:05,271 --> 01:58:06,980
that exists.
I liked that.

2749
01:58:07,610 --> 01:58:09,770
I liked the fact that someone takes care
of your sewage.

2750
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:13,270
I agree.
I like the fact that I can buy a steak

2751
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:15,710
for sure.
All I'm saying is like,

2752
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:16,573
yeah,
if you could earn the right to eat 

2753
01:58:17,691 --> 01:58:19,520
steak,
you know,

2754
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:21,740
say you have to do it every time.
You wouldn't.

2755
01:58:21,741 --> 01:58:24,710
You wouldn't have to like kill a cow 
every time you learn to eat more.

2756
01:58:24,711 --> 01:58:27,120
It's like once you finish that cal,
you need to kill another one.

2757
01:58:27,121 --> 01:58:30,380
I'm just saying everyone should know 
what it's like to take an animal's life.

2758
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:32,360
No,
I agree with you to eat meat.

2759
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:33,283
I agree.
Everyone should probably know what it's 

2760
01:58:34,011 --> 01:58:36,140
like because.
Because if you don't,

2761
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,590
it's hard to respect that animal enough.
Like,

2762
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,680
like I was saying,
like my,

2763
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:40,910
my,
my kids don't.

2764
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:41,980
We don't

2765
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,170
waste deer meat.
Like if it's on their plate,

2766
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:45,310
they eat it.
If they don't eat it,

2767
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:47,110
I put it in there,
eat it next day or whatever it is.

2768
01:58:47,111 --> 01:58:47,830
You know,
there's,

2769
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:48,663
there's always a lesson to be to be 
taught when you're eating wild gained 

2770
01:58:50,801 --> 01:58:52,480
that you,
that you've hunted yourself.

2771
01:58:52,481 --> 01:58:53,314
I think.
Well I think there's a problem whenever 

2772
01:58:54,701 --> 01:58:56,110
there's a disconnect,
right?

2773
01:58:56,530 --> 01:58:57,363
It's like,
I think there's a problem with if money 

2774
01:58:59,441 --> 01:59:03,300
just comes for free,
there's a problem with your meat.

2775
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:04,660
Just comes from a store,
is it?

2776
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,613
There's a weird disconnect between the 
actual thing that's living and then 

2777
01:59:09,761 --> 01:59:10,594
eating it and most people,
the vast majority of people are 

2778
01:59:14,141 --> 01:59:14,974
completely disconnected from that.
Maybe that's all that's the case with 

2779
01:59:17,861 --> 01:59:18,694
farming vegetables to most people.
I don't think they have an appreciation 

2780
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:24,710
for vegetable being a life form.
You're,

2781
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:26,740
you're consuming that,
you know,

2782
01:59:26,741 --> 01:59:27,940
there's a growth process.

2783
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:30,400
It's a living thing.
He pulled it out of the ground.

2784
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:31,480
You Cook it,
you eat it.

2785
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,373
I mean,
this disconnect I think is real too 

2786
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:35,463
because there's a real good feeling that
I get when I eat vegetables that have 

2787
01:59:37,871 --> 01:59:39,690
grown in my garden,
you know?

2788
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:40,570
I mean,
I love it.

2789
01:59:40,571 --> 01:59:41,870
I really,
I really enjoy it.

2790
01:59:41,871 --> 01:59:42,704
I get a kick out of it and there's a lot
of people who look down on us for 

2791
01:59:44,801 --> 01:59:48,580
hunting who are say like,
you're a Vegan who just eats nothing but

2792
01:59:48,581 --> 01:59:50,500
vegetables and fruit,
whatever it is.

2793
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:52,090
And uh,
you know,

2794
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:53,740
they're looking at us like we're crazy 
for,

2795
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,113
for,
you know,

2796
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:57,670
the impact we have on the animals,
killing them,

2797
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:58,513
whatever.
But like a lot of the vegetables that 

2798
01:59:59,801 --> 02:00:03,640
people eat nowadays are grown in places 
that used to be rainforest,

2799
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:06,670
like the Amazon just getting whacked 
down just to grow corn,

2800
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:07,780
stuff like that.

2801
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:10,300
You know what I mean?
Like there's a lot of it is just cattle,

2802
02:00:10,301 --> 02:00:11,134
right?
Isn't that Amazon a lot of the 

2803
02:00:11,590 --> 02:00:14,200
deforestation.
I think that the primary,

2804
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:17,680
a lot of ethanol to though isn't for,
for corn,

2805
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:21,100
you know there's.
But I think hardwoods,

2806
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:22,213
the chopped a lot of it down for 
hardwoods and they dropped a lot of it 

2807
02:00:24,131 --> 02:00:27,970
down to in order to provide grazing 
lands for cattle.

2808
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:28,973
They going the future.
All of the vegetables and stuff we're 

2809
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:31,510
going to be.
I was talking to Kelly about this a lot.

2810
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:32,403
There's a lot of things that are 
happening now with technology that I 

2811
02:00:35,381 --> 02:00:36,214
think a lot of like the vegetables and 
stuff that we're going to eating or 

2812
02:00:38,291 --> 02:00:39,124
going to be grown vertically instead of 
on these massive farms have like these 

2813
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:45,940
huge,
like 100,000

2814
02:00:45,941 --> 02:00:46,774
Acre ranch is full of vegetables.
It's all gonna be grown like in smaller 

2815
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,130
spaces,
you know,

2816
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,083
super,
super efficient growing and smaller 

2817
02:00:53,561 --> 02:00:55,990
spaces to feed more people with less 
space.

2818
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:59,590
I wonder if they could do be crazy.
It's gonna be crazy.

2819
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:01,330
Yeah,
that would be crazy.

2820
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,430
I mean there's probably some real 
benefits to that,

2821
02:01:03,431 --> 02:01:04,990
but I wonder if they could do that with 
grain.

2822
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:06,003
We're going to have to do something with
our population keeping growing and more 

2823
02:01:09,071 --> 02:01:13,210
people and more demand for food and less
space to grow it.

2824
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:14,133
You know,
there's gonna be an inflection point 

2825
02:01:14,921 --> 02:01:16,480
where somebody's going to have to do 
something.

2826
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:18,670
But I think technology is moving in that
place where.

2827
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:20,590
And that's the thing.
I,

2828
02:01:20,591 --> 02:01:21,424
I,
I fully get like the people who hate on 

2829
02:01:22,661 --> 02:01:24,300
me on say,
social media,

2830
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:26,650
whatever on my instagram,
if I post a photo of my,

2831
02:01:26,890 --> 02:01:27,723
if I did post a photo of me getting an 
elk or whatever it was and all these 

2832
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,500
people get uppity.
But um,

2833
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:35,170
because a lot of people can't go 
hunting.

2834
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:38,470
I don't live in a place where they can 
go hunting and get their own meat.

2835
02:01:38,471 --> 02:01:39,304
They live in a city,
live in New York City or Shanghai or 

2836
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,910
Buenos Aires or whatever,
and they did so unrelatable to them,

2837
02:01:43,911 --> 02:01:44,820
you know?
No,

2838
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,160
I understand that.
I appreciate that.

2839
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,233
And you know,
I think that social media is very 

2840
02:01:49,221 --> 02:01:50,054
strange in that regard too because 
people are always looking for people or 

2841
02:01:52,671 --> 02:01:54,000
things.
You get pissed off out.

2842
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:56,180
Oh yeah.
They don't get mad if I post pictures of

2843
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:57,620
cooking though.
No,

2844
02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:59,390
they don't.
I mean a few.

2845
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:01,630
There's a few like proselytize very 
games.

2846
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,640
You're going to get cancer,
man.

2847
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:06,650
There was one of the alleys do that.
I think cancer comes from meat.

2848
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:09,680
He if all meet gabby cancer now fucking 
stupid.

2849
02:02:09,681 --> 02:02:10,514
That is everyone would have cancer,
like literally 95 percent of the 

2850
02:02:13,071 --> 02:02:17,960
population with cancer.
So there's a few epidemiological studies

2851
02:02:17,961 --> 02:02:21,650
that have fuck people's heads up because
they've Kerr corresponded.

2852
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,490
They're related.
The idea of eating meat to poor health,

2853
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:28,610
but these people that have eaten meat,
they don't just eat meat.

2854
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:32,790
They've eaten meat along with sugar and 
alcohol consumption.

2855
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:33,643
Cigarettes and lifestyle.
They don't factor those things in there 

2856
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:37,600
like a,
like a,

2857
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:41,720
like a 30 ounce prime rib.
Your body is impossible for your body to

2858
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:42,554
process that.
Like more likely they're eating burgers 

2859
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:47,880
with sugary bonds and processed meat and
bullshit.

2860
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:49,980
When I eat meat,
I normally meet the.

2861
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:52,280
That's like the size of my palm or a 
smaller,

2862
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:54,440
you know,
eight wild game and it's that size.

2863
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:56,690
I think it's easy for my body to process
that.

2864
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,720
Eating like a prime rib that's hanging 
off both sides of your plate,

2865
02:02:59,721 --> 02:03:00,554
like Fred Flintstone.
That's difficult I think for your body 

2866
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:03,930
to process that.
I just got it.

2867
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:06,350
That's not scientific.
I just look at it and go,

2868
02:03:06,351 --> 02:03:07,190
there's no way I can.

2869
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:09,410
My body's going to deal with that.
Where's it going to fit?

2870
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:11,420
It's going to stay in it for 30 years.
You know?

2871
02:03:11,421 --> 02:03:13,670
They always say that it's going to stay 
true to.

2872
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:16,910
That's all nonsense to.
Wasn't Kelly's talking about like,

2873
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:20,410
are they shooting his butt out and 
stuff?

2874
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:23,830
He was talking about talk.
Yeah,

2875
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,673
he was talking about um,
when you go on these extreme fasts and 

2876
02:03:28,371 --> 02:03:32,540
then all this weird stuff that comes out
of the inside of your gut comes out.

2877
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,613
Yeah,
I would try that just to look at that 

2878
02:03:35,361 --> 02:03:36,980
stuff,
see what this stuff looks like.

2879
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:38,420
Yeah.
I would try it,

2880
02:03:38,421 --> 02:03:40,100
but I wouldn't want to.
I wouldn't want to look at it.

2881
02:03:40,101 --> 02:03:41,690
I definitely would want like the,
like the,

2882
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:42,603
you know,
when like when you have a baby and they 

2883
02:03:43,011 --> 02:03:46,040
put up like a curtain sometime to see 
anything like that.

2884
02:03:46,041 --> 02:03:46,400
Like,
okay,

2885
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,570
I'm going to put my legs up.

2886
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:52,580
Someone's got a visual of that,
cut my legs up and somebody,

2887
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:56,600
someone out there doing all that stuff.
You grow your own vegetables.

2888
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:59,450
I don't know.
I travel half the time.

2889
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:01,880
I'm gone from home like literally half 
the time.

2890
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:02,714
So it's really difficult to.
Is it hard getting good vegetables on 

2891
02:04:05,061 --> 02:04:07,250
the Big Island?
Um,

2892
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:09,520
no there's not,
it's,

2893
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:10,910
it's,
it's actually really easy.

2894
02:04:10,911 --> 02:04:13,450
It was really good farmer's markets.
I'm lucky because my,

2895
02:04:13,690 --> 02:04:16,130
my mom and her boyfriend have a really 
neat,

2896
02:04:16,131 --> 02:04:18,650
like a hydroponic killer vegetable 
garden.

2897
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:19,850
Oh Wow.
So like we'll trade,

2898
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:20,684
a lot of times I'll,
I'll give them venison and I'll get 

2899
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:24,720
really good ideas from them and stuff 
like that.

2900
02:04:24,721 --> 02:04:26,810
That's great trade.
That's cool.

2901
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:27,530
Yeah.
So there's,

2902
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:32,060
there's a lot of meals that we do where 
like no one has touched that meal except

2903
02:04:32,061 --> 02:04:33,560
for my family was.
It's cool.

2904
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:37,830
I love Zan has a,
she's got a macadamia farm

2905
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,160
on the big island and she raves about it
up there.

2906
02:04:41,161 --> 02:04:42,090
Man,
she loves it.

2907
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,280
I listened to part of her podcast if you
haven't finished it yet,

2908
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:47,350
but she's amazing.
She's funny.

2909
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:47,980
She's,

2910
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:49,750
you know what man?
They fucked up.

2911
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,820
They really did fuck up.
They fucked up when they blew it on.

2912
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:56,230
That lady is not racist.
She's definitely mentally ill,

2913
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:59,600
but she's open about it.
She's not racist and they,

2914
02:04:59,601 --> 02:05:00,434
they just,
they just jumped on the opportunity to 

2915
02:05:02,021 --> 02:05:06,430
virtue signal and to cry out against 
racism and to take a stand.

2916
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:09,550
But they took a stand against a woman 
that has mental problems,

2917
02:05:09,551 --> 02:05:12,010
who's on all sorts of medication?
Who they knew about it.

2918
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:13,243
I mean,
she's been.

2919
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:18,600
She was put in a mental hospital for 
nine months when she was a kid and she's

2920
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:22,690
hit by a car.
I mean she had a severe brain injury and

2921
02:05:22,691 --> 02:05:25,420
ever since then she's had multiple 
personality disorder.

2922
02:05:25,421 --> 02:05:28,540
She's been on a host of different 
medications and they knew about this.

2923
02:05:28,630 --> 02:05:31,070
Everybody knew about this.
They should have known that.

2924
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:31,973
It's basically like taking a person 
who's got a broken leg and getting mad 

2925
02:05:34,661 --> 02:05:35,494
that they limp.

2926
02:05:36,230 --> 02:05:37,180
It's what they did.
Yeah.

2927
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:40,480
I mean they have a person who had brain 
problems who,

2928
02:05:40,510 --> 02:05:44,560
who tweets a bunch of wacky shit.
She's on Ambien and drinking and smoking

2929
02:05:44,561 --> 02:05:47,320
pot and even then she wasn't being 
racist.

2930
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:49,450
She wasn't.
She didn't know that lady was black.

2931
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:51,670
The lady didn't even look black.
If you look at her,

2932
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:54,250
you look at a picture of her.
She does not look black.

2933
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:58,840
She just thought she was being funny and
she thought she was making a solid point

2934
02:05:58,841 --> 02:05:59,674
that she was going to expand upon what 
you woke up in the morning as she 

2935
02:06:01,901 --> 02:06:02,734
literally said,
that just all fucked up on Ambien and 

2936
02:06:04,601 --> 02:06:06,880
pot and drinking.
I listened to as crazy.

2937
02:06:07,150 --> 02:06:07,871
Yeah.
That was fucked up.

2938
02:06:07,871 --> 02:06:10,150
That happen to her and it sucks that or 
show got canceled.

2939
02:06:10,420 --> 02:06:12,800
Well the new one sucks.
The nuanced sucks.

2940
02:06:12,820 --> 02:06:14,020
It's going down the toilet.

2941
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:14,933
So.
Hey,

2942
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:18,160
I'm sorta the same subject.
Did you see the,

2943
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:19,203
that Rad documentary about the white 
woman who ran the Naacp and fricken act 

2944
02:06:23,851 --> 02:06:25,740
like a black lady?
I know who she is,

2945
02:06:25,810 --> 02:06:26,643
but Rachel Dolezal best,
best frigging documentaries or as well 

2946
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:32,430
as incredible documentary.
Yeah,

2947
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:34,890
insane.
She out of her mind,

2948
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:36,413
they kept asking her if she was black 
and she would just straight up like at 

2949
02:06:39,121 --> 02:06:39,954
first she said yes.
And then she said like it's not that 

2950
02:06:41,701 --> 02:06:42,534
important.
And then she was like tanning herself 

2951
02:06:44,401 --> 02:06:45,234
and like putting all this brown on 
herself and getting like weaves and 

2952
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:51,354
doing her nails,
like how she thought like black people 

2953
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:55,860
would do their nails.
Like it was super weird.

2954
02:06:55,861 --> 02:06:58,410
And then she ran.
She ran the NAACP.

2955
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:02,220
It was just a wild documentaries.
That chick was just in outer space.

2956
02:07:02,221 --> 02:07:06,060
It's hilarious that she ran the NAACP.
Yeah,

2957
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:09,120
probably did a good job and she had a 
huge impact.

2958
02:07:09,121 --> 02:07:11,660
She was like amazing at her job.
Supposedly in the,

2959
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:12,633
in the documentary is saying that she 
got all this stuff done at that they 

2960
02:07:15,271 --> 02:07:16,950
were trying to do for a long time and 
she was really,

2961
02:07:16,951 --> 02:07:17,784
really good at doing her job.
It just sucked that she was actually a 

2962
02:07:20,551 --> 02:07:22,200
white lady who was acting the whole 
time.

2963
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:23,480
Well,
what's really fucked oct

2964
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:24,333
is Naacp stands for the National 
Association for the advancement of 

2965
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:28,713
colored people.
You cannot call African-american's 

2966
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:34,300
colored people.
That is a fucking slur.

2967
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:36,100
They have slur in

2968
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:37,990
their title.
We're leaving in weird times.

2969
02:07:37,991 --> 02:07:42,991
Men can say people of Color,
which is fucking bizarre.

2970
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:46,080
Yeah.
You can't say colored people as well.

2971
02:07:46,081 --> 02:07:49,690
You can say people of color.
The same words just twisted around.

2972
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:50,870
Dude.
I had a um,

2973
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:54,280
it's messed up.
It's like you can just be like labeled a

2974
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:56,950
racist or sexist or whatever for like 
saying like,

2975
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,370
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2976
02:07:58,371 --> 02:07:59,490
that's wild.
Um,

2977
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,640
I had a 23 and me DNA tests done and 
they're pretty good.

2978
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:05,770
Yeah.
And I was hoping I was.

2979
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:08,910
If I was more than 10 percent black,
I was going to start dropping bombs,

2980
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:13,360
but a one point six.
So one point six,

2981
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:16,300
one point six percent African,
pretty strong,

2982
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:18,370
it's all Dick.
And uh,

2983
02:08:19,970 --> 02:08:22,660
when,
when they did that thing about Elizabeth

2984
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:24,580
Warren,
I did find out what percentage.

2985
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:29,650
She is a Elizabeth Warren who claim to 
be native American and she did a test,

2986
02:08:29,890 --> 02:08:33,460
she's like one,
one,

2987
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:38,550
100th of what I am like,
it's literally like her saying she's,

2988
02:08:39,011 --> 02:08:39,844
yeah,
her saying she's a native American is 

2989
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:48,031
literally like me saying I'm African 
American but I have more of a claim,

2990
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:53,080
have far more like more than I think 
some,

2991
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,033
some insane number,
like a factor of more African in me and 

2992
02:09:00,281 --> 02:09:04,180
she has native American and I'm not even
remotely native American.

2993
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:05,930
Remotely African.
Yeah.

2994
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:07,343
I'm one point six percent of one point 
six percent African in me and she has 

2995
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:15,720
like some fucking really stupid number.
What is the dump?

2996
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:16,913
It's like point zero zero.
I don't even know how to make sense of 

2997
02:09:20,471 --> 02:09:21,304
all that stuff she had.
That was what happened was a harvard 

2998
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:29,530
researcher looked into it and gave a 
number that was very vague.

2999
02:09:29,531 --> 02:09:34,531
That would be like one and 500,
12 to one and 1020 fourth,

3000
02:09:36,370 --> 02:09:37,660
something like that.
That sucks.

3001
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:41,080
It sucks.
It sucks that that's the thing,

3002
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:42,203
like who gives a shit,
but she got into Harvard because of 

3003
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:46,474
this,
which she claimed she was native 

3004
02:09:47,321 --> 02:09:51,530
American when she got in.
That was claiming that she was a minor.

3005
02:09:51,610 --> 02:09:52,443
Was Hartford,
right?

3006
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,280
Correct.
I'm being honest with that.

3007
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,280
Was it Cambridge?
Whatever.

3008
02:09:57,281 --> 02:09:58,114
The university.
Shenandoah university by claiming that 

3009
02:10:01,211 --> 02:10:03,790
she was native American,
so she got a special scholarship because

3010
02:10:03,791 --> 02:10:07,810
of that.
Literally like me going to Morehouse and

3011
02:10:07,811 --> 02:10:08,920
saying,
I'm African American,

3012
02:10:08,921 --> 02:10:13,921
except I have a far better claim.
You have a much higher percentage.

3013
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:14,853
Much higher.

3014
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:18,460
That's so crazy.
Wild.

3015
02:10:18,461 --> 02:10:19,294
Meanwhile,
she's so nuts like because trump was 

3016
02:10:21,131 --> 02:10:23,930
always calling her pocahontas and trump 
said that if,

3017
02:10:25,310 --> 02:10:26,800
how,
how is it that you can't.

3018
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:28,960
If you said the wrong thing on your 
podcast,

3019
02:10:29,190 --> 02:10:30,023
people will be up in arms,
but it's unreasonably president can say 

3020
02:10:31,691 --> 02:10:32,524
whatever the hell he wants to say.
He's making tending to be a native 

3021
02:10:35,961 --> 02:10:38,020
American.
He was joking about heart.

3022
02:10:38,021 --> 02:10:41,000
She's not really native American,
and he called her pocahontas and he said

3023
02:10:41,001 --> 02:10:43,850
if she took a DNA test and showed that 
she was native American,

3024
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:46,670
he would donate a million dollars to a 
charity of your choice.

3025
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:47,713
So she,
after this fucking test that basically 

3026
02:10:50,661 --> 02:10:55,340
showed she has these smallest measurable
possibility.

3027
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:59,780
Native American in her was requiring him
to pay.

3028
02:11:01,570 --> 02:11:06,570
You should pay Harvard for the money 
back built from them were at school.

3029
02:11:08,121 --> 02:11:11,990
Did she go to trying to find the actual 
thing it seems.

3030
02:11:11,991 --> 02:11:14,090
I think she actually got a job at 
Harvard.

3031
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:15,143
Not.

3032
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:19,630
Didn't go there for education.
Oh,

3033
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:22,620
she got a job there because of trying to
find out.

3034
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:23,870
Okay,
we'll figure it out.

3035
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:26,000
But that's hilarious.
The I.

3036
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:31,150
The idea that that is something you can 
lean on is so goddamn crazy.

3037
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:33,740
Listen,
you're a white lady.

3038
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:36,800
I'm a white guy.
Shut the fuck up.

3039
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:37,663
Okay.
You're not.

3040
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:38,623
There's no.
There's not a part of you that has been 

3041
02:11:40,761 --> 02:11:43,970
discriminated against because of the 
fact that you're native American.

3042
02:11:43,971 --> 02:11:45,920
It just doesn't exist.
It's not true.

3043
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,580
That's just so fascinating to me.
People love to be a victim.

3044
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:50,860
They love to say,
you know,

3045
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:53,320
it was my growing up was hard because 
I'm one,

3046
02:11:53,321 --> 02:11:56,570
150,000
native American.

3047
02:11:56,571 --> 02:11:58,010
Crazy,
crazy.

3048
02:11:58,420 --> 02:11:59,810
And where does it stop?
Like is it,

3049
02:11:59,870 --> 02:12:01,330
is it,
is it like,

3050
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:05,270
is it cool to say that if you're two 
percent or 10 percent or 50 percent,

3051
02:12:05,271 --> 02:12:06,230
like where's it,
where's it?

3052
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:08,420
That's what I'm saying.
At one point six percent,

3053
02:12:08,421 --> 02:12:10,660
I really don't feel like I could drop 
right.

3054
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:13,370
10,
it's not 10 percent.

3055
02:12:13,610 --> 02:12:14,443
Like I'm mostly Italian.
I'm like three quarters of Italian so I 

3056
02:12:17,061 --> 02:12:19,670
can call someone a Guinea Guinea no 
problem,

3057
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:23,240
but two times don't give a fuck if you 
call them guineas like okay,

3058
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:28,900
like there's no really,
there's no good slurs for Italians work,

3059
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:30,673
you know,
they have successfully integrated into 

3060
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:33,584
society.
But when my grandfather used to tell me 

3061
02:12:35,271 --> 02:12:37,190
about,
he came over here when he was a boy from

3062
02:12:37,191 --> 02:12:38,024
Italy and he would tell me about how bad
it was about how much they were 

3063
02:12:41,691 --> 02:12:43,770
discriminated against.
It was,

3064
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:44,783
it was hard core.
I mean they were treated a lot of the 

3065
02:12:47,121 --> 02:12:49,220
same way.
Racist People Treat Mexicans today.

3066
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:50,510
An Irish,
same thing.

3067
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:51,330
Same thing,
yeah.

3068
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:52,163
Yeah,
and that's my background is Italian and 

3069
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:54,710
Irish.
Mostly.

3070
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:58,340
Someone got fucked by a black person 
somewhere,

3071
02:12:58,700 --> 02:12:59,250
somewhere.

3072
02:12:59,250 --> 02:13:01,880
One point six percent know how many 
generations.

3073
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:03,343
I guess the claim is that she used her 
claim that she's native American to get 

3074
02:13:06,741 --> 02:13:07,760
a job.
Yes.

3075
02:13:07,810 --> 02:13:09,650
Not.
Not to get into school,

3076
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:12,470
get a job at Harvard,
at one at Harvard,

3077
02:13:12,471 --> 02:13:14,690
one at Pennsylvania.
So she did it twice.

3078
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,680
Give that money back.
But I love the DNA test though.

3079
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:22,820
I love the DNA test just proves it.
We're all like something.

3080
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:24,110
We're all a bunch of shit.
Like,

3081
02:13:24,650 --> 02:13:28,010
you know what I mean?
I'm like 30 things of whatever.

3082
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:30,070
You know what I mean?
Like it does.

3083
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,290
Does it matter?
Not really.

3084
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:33,510
Shouldn't matter.
Well really we're all African.

3085
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:34,493
All of us.
Because that was the original human 

3086
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:36,960
being.
It depends who you ask.

3087
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:40,890
I mean we came from our human beings 
evolved from Africa.

3088
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:41,724
If you believe in evolution,
if you believe in evolution is where it 

3089
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:45,730
gets a big f.
