1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
And

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,503
three,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,643
two,

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,143
one.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,173
No.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,910
Yes.

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,181
Okay.

8
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:12,960
It's a lot.

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,340
It's been fucking up a little bit lately.

10
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,883
How are you man?

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,670
Thanks for having me.

12
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,241
My pleasure.

13
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:18,721
My pleasure.

14
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,080
Yeah,

15
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,000
you brought me a nice conspiracy book.

16
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,930
I want you back.

17
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,253
I want you to

18
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,813
get bored with it.

19
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,480
I know.

20
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,510
I just had a lunch with Eric von,

21
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,344
Danica.

22
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:32,430
Uh,

23
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,230
he's the author of Church of the Gods.

24
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,630
The last two hours we've been
talking to ancient aliens.

25
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,210
I was deep when I was like in,

26
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:39,330
in my late teens.

27
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:44,331
I was deep in Zachariah stitching and
Inaki filium I'm pronouncing it wrong.

28
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,860
That lead my thing.

29
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,703
Nephilim,

30
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,650
planet x Nibiru all over.

31
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,311
Yeah.

32
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,010
That's a lot of the conversation
we had today at lunch.

33
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,030
It's very interesting.

34
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,530
The problem with someone,

35
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:55,801
I mean,

36
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,380
it's not that he's not a dishonest person,

37
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,071
I'm not saying that,

38
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:03,000
but the problem with anybody
that is involved with like
a book like this is that

39
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,830
you're so all in,

40
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,350
you're so committed to this idea.

41
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,341
Like I asked him,

42
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,091
the first thing I asked him,

43
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:09,301
I was like,

44
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,340
what is the most compelling
piece of evidence?

45
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,211
And,

46
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,044
um,

47
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,490
he said the,

48
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,340
the tablet and [inaudible] I don't
know if you're aware of that one.

49
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,030
Yeah.

50
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,863
The one of the,

51
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,370
the Aztec Aztec or a mine
I guess the mind guy.

52
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:24,140
It's mine.

53
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,810
Um,

54
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,160
who's laying back.

55
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,670
Uh,

56
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,530
it looks like in some sort of a throne
with five below him and he's manipulating

57
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:33,540
these knobs and shit.

58
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,320
And that means that aliens landed
and seeded them with technology.

59
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:37,951
Yeah.

60
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:39,630
They always make a little bit of a jump.

61
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,890
It's a big one that's like evil Knievel.

62
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,760
It's a little bit of a jump between
that bird is really a symbol of a flying

63
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:48,181
saucer.

64
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:48,961
I've heard that too.

65
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:50,760
I've heard that one like that bird.

66
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,091
And I'm like,

67
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:51,211
well,

68
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,230
let me ask you a question.

69
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,890
Why didn't they ask you a flying
saucer right into the cave?

70
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:56,941
And they're like,

71
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,171
well,

72
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,950
let you don't know how things work.

73
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,790
The more interesting ones and the art
depictions that there's some really

74
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,590
ancient depictions of people that look
like they're in these flying saucer type

75
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:08,011
things,

76
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:11,750
like flying through the air and
they're in some sort of a like,

77
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,180
you know,

78
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,600
some,

79
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,530
some painting.

80
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,280
Yeah.

81
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,671
Those are,

82
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,250
those are really interesting cause
like what were they trying to say?

83
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:17,880
Like what were they,

84
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,870
what were they depicting?

85
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,704
And those things.

86
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,060
I mean it's all very interesting,

87
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:21,930
but I think you,

88
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,300
and you've had Graham Hancock on.

89
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,290
So to me when I heard him,

90
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:25,561
I was like,

91
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:30,561
that makes more sense that we were just
a civilization that had reached an apex

92
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,270
and it got wiped out by some cataclysmic
event and then we had to rebuild.

93
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,680
But is does he think that we got all
of our technology from other worldly

94
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,580
sources or no,

95
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,030
not really.

96
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,620
It doesn't,

97
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,380
it doesn't.

98
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,200
Ram is much more in line with this.

99
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:46,980
Um,

100
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,800
this theory that doctor Robert
Schoch has been putting forth,

101
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,650
he was one of the weirder ones
that I've had on the podcast.

102
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,101
First of all,

103
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:55,230
because he's a rock solid geologist,

104
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,390
professor at Boston University,

105
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,310
like really well established.

106
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,700
His credentials are,

107
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,803
you know,

108
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,651
they're,

109
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,030
they're as good as it gets.

110
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:08,440
And he was saying that he thinks that
there was a mass coronal mass ejection

111
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,330
somewhere around 12,000 years ago and
it was literally raining lightning all

112
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,021
over the world.

113
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,970
And decimated the population
of land mammals and,

114
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,760
and people.

115
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,230
Just what got the dinosaurs?

116
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:20,810
No,

117
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:20,991
no,

118
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:21,370
no.

119
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,150
This was way late.

120
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,983
I apologize.

121
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,300
This is like my bad.

122
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,703
This is a,

123
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,230
they think in the neighborhood
of 12,000 years ago.

124
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,100
They think this is recent.

125
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,620
Yeah.

126
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,710
This is what Graham Hancock's
work indicates as well.

127
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,101
See,

128
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:41,101
Graham Hancock and him were together on
the Sphinx because Robert Schoch was the

129
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:46,330
geologist they brought in to examine
the erosion marks on the temple.

130
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,920
That's Sphinx.

131
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,440
Yeah.

132
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,370
And his conclusion was that this is
the result of thousands of years of

133
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:52,204
rainfall.

134
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:52,510
Right.

135
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,260
The problem with that was the last time
there were significant rainfall in the

136
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,000
Nile Valley was 9,000 BC.

137
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,370
So you'd have to have thousands of years
before that to create these deep water

138
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:05,190
based fishers or water
created fissures to,

139
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:08,260
they're saying the Sphinx was there
a lot longer than we imagined.

140
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:08,651
Yeah.

141
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:11,560
So that coincides with a lot of these,

142
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,060
the,

143
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,241
the,

144
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,010
the people that want to push
back the dates of civilization,

145
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,390
what they think is that it all points
to something big happening at the end of

146
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:19,921
the ice age.

147
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:20,350
Yeah.

148
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,980
So something big happening between
12,000 and 10,000 years ago.

149
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,070
Why don't mainstream
scientists just go now?

150
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,090
I'm sure there's a reason for this.

151
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:32,530
And I think there's a reason
that mainstream thought
leaders in any area don't

152
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,840
allow the fringe in why?

153
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,040
What's the big thing here
with keeping these guys?

154
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,230
Is it that they would just have to go
back and relook at every history book?

155
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,741
Well,

156
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,210
in the beginning there was nothing,

157
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,631
right?

158
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,280
So when these guys were proposing this,

159
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,510
there was very little evidence,

160
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,660
but now that evidence is stacking up
and there's all these ancient structures

161
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:52,410
that they're finding like
go Beckley Tepi yeah.

162
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,610
If once they found that one and they
realize that it was intentionally covered

163
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,290
up 12,000 years ago.

164
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,370
So this is like,

165
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,990
this is undeniable.

166
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:02,950
Everyone agrees on it.

167
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,370
Yeah.

168
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,480
And so then they have to say,

169
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:04,721
okay,

170
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,720
well then hunter gatherers must've
made this cause 12,000 years ago.

171
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,010
That's all we had was a hunter gatherers.

172
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:12,700
But it's really sophisticated construction
and it's very difficult to do.

173
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,960
And they're enormous.

174
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:17,410
And they have three dimensional
animals that are carved into them,

175
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,060
which means they actually had to carve
away the outside to create the animal.

176
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,050
Instead of carving the
animal into the stone,

177
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,560
they actually carved the
stone out around the animal.

178
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,890
So these animals are like climbing on
the outside of these stone columns.

179
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:30,890
It's really weird stuff.

180
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,743
Yeah,

181
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,370
but who the fuck knows I,

182
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:33,911
I'm,

183
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:38,911
I lean more towards cataclysmic disaster
because there's so many of them that we

184
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,720
know for sure have happened.

185
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:41,230
Right.

186
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,790
But between the one 65 million years
ago in the Yucatan that killed the

187
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,600
dinosaurs,

188
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,260
just reading about the ARkStorm
that's going to hit la,

189
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,410
which he'll just be 60
days of rain Wednesday,

190
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,070
it happens every 200 years.

191
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,341
I mean,

192
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:54,521
I,

193
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:54,940
you know,

194
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,100
this is an article I read every 200 years.

195
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,160
La in the area

196
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,900
gets 60 90 days of rain and
everybody has to move and things.

197
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,960
This is supposedly what somebody sang,

198
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,850
somebody with a bunch of panicked
comedians who are all thinking about,

199
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,050
they're worried about the ARkStorm now
it's fun to think about stupid the best.

200
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:19,110
It's thinking about like
conspiracies and big foot.

201
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:19,400
Yeah.

202
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,760
Ufo shows and shit like that.

203
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:22,370
It teaches you how to think a little,

204
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:23,900
like when I was a teenager,

205
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,980
I was smoking weed with my buddies.

206
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:26,000
Like we would,

207
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,520
you'd have to research these things.

208
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,770
You'd have to cross reference information.

209
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,380
You couldn't just swallow the narrative.

210
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,470
You had to literally go well and then
you'd have to use critical thinking to go,

211
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,730
does this make sense?

212
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,200
Would this have happened?

213
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,380
Could maybe could Lee Harvey Oswald at?

214
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,771
What about,

215
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:42,981
you know,

216
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,240
would he have acted alone?

217
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:44,780
Hah.

218
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:44,991
You know,

219
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,310
you have to think about all these things.

220
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,541
I mean,

221
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:47,701
I,

222
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,700
I do think since Trump got elected,

223
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,660
conspiracy theorist had been
demonized and nobody talks about that.

224
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,441
This is a little bit,

225
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:54,621
well,

226
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:55,580
it was always going on.

227
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,770
It was even before that
there were being demonized.

228
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,011
But yeah,

229
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:58,610
for sure.

230
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,840
Cause worried about the other groups,

231
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:00,674
which is fair.

232
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
I get that there's the
people in the cages.

233
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,470
No good.

234
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,580
I'm not for any of that.

235
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,420
People in the cage,

236
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:05,601
they will.

237
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,400
The kids in the cages is not good.

238
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,170
What do you mean the family separation?

239
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh,

240
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,833
all the course.

241
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,713
Real stop.

242
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,160
But I think that people think that
conspiracy theories got Trump elected,

243
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,640
so now it's like cool to hate conspiracy
theorists or people that are like,

244
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,090
let's take another look at this.

245
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:25,760
There's so many factors
that got Trump elected,

246
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,140
right?

247
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,580
And it was a perfect
storm of people getting,

248
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,920
getting fed up of political correctness.

249
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,070
Someone coming along
that's not a politician.

250
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,671
You know,

251
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:39,170
the system is so rigged that after
a while you just like Jesus Christ.

252
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,110
How many more of these fake puppets
were going to put an office?

253
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,530
There's,

254
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,520
I say this to comics.

255
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:43,761
I'm like,

256
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:47,870
everybody's done a show where everybody
goes out and bombs with their material

257
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,910
and then one guy gets up and just goes,

258
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:54,911
fuck this and screams and
yells and destroys because
that's what the room wanted

259
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,151
the whole night.

260
00:07:56,151 --> 00:08:00,320
They wanted somebody to come up and just
realize how fucked everything was and

261
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,640
how nobody was having a good time.

262
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:03,020
And that's kind of what Trump was.

263
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,300
Trump was the guy that
came out and just riffed.

264
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,310
He went out there with no material.

265
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,510
He just went out there
and rift and he went and,

266
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,340
and I,

267
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,480
when I heard,

268
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,670
and I'm sure you've seen this speech where
he talks about Ben Carson going after

269
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:19,430
his mother with a hammer and
trying to stab his friend.

270
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,140
This was one of the funniest things.

271
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,690
He was speaking and he
was given a stump speech.

272
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:24,800
I don't know where it was.

273
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,910
I think it was,

274
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,810
wasn't in I will,

275
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:31,580
but he was referencing Iowa and he's
talking about Ben Carson's book and that

276
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:36,050
Ben Carson had admitted to going after
his mother with a hammer and trying to

277
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,090
stab his friend with an,

278
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:37,401
I mean,

279
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,030
these are,

280
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,220
these are in and Trump
is talking about it.

281
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,900
Me and my friend would driving,

282
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,410
uh,

283
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,370
at in New York City.

284
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,110
We were laughing so hard.

285
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,944
I said this guys,

286
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,061
I said,

287
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:47,894
he's going to win.

288
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,321
I said,

289
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,550
I'll tell you why he's going to win.

290
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,720
I cannot stop watching this.

291
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,763
I can't,

292
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,960
I am so fixated by the idea that there's
a guy like this on the national stage

293
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,930
and he sang whatever he won.

294
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,560
There was something
intoxicating about that.

295
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,300
And a lot of the things you
were saying were horrible,

296
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,950
but he was saying them.

297
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,890
And then on the other side you
had Hillary Clinton who was just,

298
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,320
they scripted Oh,

299
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,910
careful person.

300
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,744
And I'm like,

301
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,420
it's just boring to me.

302
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:26,190
I'm like sometimes he entertaining person
wins because you can't take your eyes

303
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,024
off them.

304
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,680
Well in this case for sure,

305
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,750
I mean in the that it was a perfect,

306
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,830
you know,

307
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,870
polar opposite between him and her,

308
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,100
you know,

309
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,610
no experience versus vast
amounts of experience.

310
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,040
No real experience in the real world
versus vast amount of experiences.

311
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,730
Yeah.

312
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,890
I mean there was a lot going
on between the two of them.

313
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,281
It was a,

314
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,114
it was,

315
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,430
it's,

316
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,540
it's a bad way to choose

317
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,510
runs really.

318
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,640
It's very bad to look
at candidates and go,

319
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:58,050
who's the most entertaining?

320
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,561
Well,

321
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,960
it's also a bad idea to have one person,

322
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:01,201
right?

323
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,850
It's a bad idea to have this,

324
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,660
this same system that was in
place back when there was fucking,

325
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,350
you know,

326
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,610
a thousand people here.

327
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,630
But I think we've really dealt,

328
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,020
like we have one person that
seems like we have one figurehead,

329
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,530
but we have kind of this permanent
political class of people.

330
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:16,980
Yeah,

331
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,270
a nexus of powerful institutions
where you have career politicians,

332
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,620
career diplomats,

333
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,640
career military service people
that kind of don't leave.

334
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,150
So I think that's one of the reasons
that we haven't changed the system is

335
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:33,960
because one person
can't ever do that much.

336
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,440
Even though Trump is wild and crazy
and he's done a lot of bad things.

337
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I don't think he would be allowed to
deviate from many of the policies like

338
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:44,971
that.

339
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,400
His predecessors had kind of established,

340
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,500
I think that like the American government,

341
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,480
and that's why this the
like the deep state,

342
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,640
which a lot of people ridicule.

343
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,770
It's an undeniably true thing.

344
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,341
I mean,

345
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,330
our policies are not just one
guy gets into office and he goes,

346
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:01,170
here's how it is.

347
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:01,560
Right?

348
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,380
I mean it's the result of a lot of,

349
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,010
you know,

350
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,920
private corporations lobbying,

351
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,641
forming,

352
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:11,490
all kinds of forming an agenda
and a non democratic way.

353
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,400
You know,

354
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,630
they're not accountable at a lot of these
people that work at the CIA or the FBI

355
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:17,464
or the NSA.

356
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,810
A lot of them are appointed.

357
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,590
They're not elected.

358
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,800
Right.

359
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,820
We have no oversight.

360
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,600
Um,

361
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,080
we have,

362
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,230
I think it's 22 intelligence agencies now.

363
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,550
It's really that money.

364
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,271
I mean,

365
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,500
it's something absurd.

366
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,540
How many could you name the FBI?

367
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,201
CIA,

368
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,070
NSA?

369
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,760
Uh,

370
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,840
probably DEA,

371
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,770
DEA,

372
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,603
and intelligence.

373
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,010
I wouldn't say it's an intelligence
that they probably have intelligence

374
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:38,880
capabilities.

375
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,870
I would imagine.

376
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,501
FBI,

377
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,220
CIA,

378
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,053
NSA,

379
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,600
uh,

380
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,910
there's one and yet the dia,

381
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,290
director of intelligence,

382
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,611
the Pentagon.

383
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:47,881
I mean,

384
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,110
I don't know if that's an entire agency,

385
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:49,570
but I think it,

386
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:49,831
I mean,

387
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,360
I think it has the capabilities,

388
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,190
but we have all of these different,

389
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,160
I don't know if it's 22,

390
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,940
but it's a lot.

391
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,350
And they're all competing with each other.

392
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,060
They're all competing
because they all want money.

393
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,170
They want budget.

394
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,981
They all want,

395
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,000
and that's the thing that
people talking about,

396
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,480
the deep state.

397
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,530
It's like we got them all.

398
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:02,930
Yeah.

399
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,630
Look at these guys who they are.

400
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,310
Jesus.

401
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,700
Here are all the people that are,

402
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:06,931
you know,

403
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:07,410
what?

404
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:07,770
Listening.

405
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,270
Excited.

406
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,740
Yeah.

407
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,740
The fucking space troops that we have
space that's going to be good and why not?

408
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,150
Why not a space for it will eventually,

409
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:16,451
right?

410
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,010
Eventually you're going
to have to have it.

411
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh yes.

412
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,121
Why not have it?

413
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:19,930
Now we have,

414
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,410
I don't know what the national
geospatial intelligence thing does.

415
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,000
They can't be any more
relevant than space force.

416
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,711
Click on that one.

417
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:31,120
National Geospatial Intelligence Agency
shouldn't be any less important than the

418
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:31,954
space force.

419
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Who the fuck knows how many people were
working on employs 16,000 thousand look

420
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:38,590
at it.

421
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,460
Look at their motto.

422
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,510
Scroll down a little bit.

423
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,500
Scroll down.

424
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,300
No earth show the way.

425
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,510
Understand the world what that's
founded in [inaudible] 96 yeah,

426
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,940
Clinton probably did.

427
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,660
It's probably where he keeps his chicks.

428
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,190
I mean this,

429
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,390
right,

430
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:50,950
but this is,

431
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,641
this is what I mean.

432
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,890
Like what the hell are
these people doing now?

433
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:54,311
What is it?

434
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,740
16,000 employees with their motto?

435
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,251
No,

436
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:59,020
the earth show the way.

437
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,280
Understand the world.

438
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,740
That sounds like a year
like on a yoga studios,

439
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,250
you know?

440
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,431
I mean,

441
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,181
it's absurd,

442
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,360
but they get billions of
dollars to do whatever.

443
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,593
Listen,

444
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,320
put that back up there
with the description.

445
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:11,900
Look at,

446
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,280
we're good.

447
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,113
It says there,

448
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,230
it's a,

449
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,640
it's under the United States Department
of Defense and Intelligence Agency of

450
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:22,000
the United States intelligence community
with the primary mission of collecting,

451
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,240
analyzing and distributing geospatial
intelligence in support of national

452
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:28,180
security,

453
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,013
which is why,

454
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,680
what does that mean?

455
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,660
What the Hell is geospatial intelligence?

456
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,250
I mean this is what I mean.

457
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,540
This is insane.

458
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,591
And if any,

459
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:36,670
if you ask a question,

460
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:36,941
if you go,

461
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,031
well,

462
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:37,811
what do these guys do?

463
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,620
People yell at you and they started with,

464
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,270
Oh,

465
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:40,711
you're the,

466
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:42,880
you're a conspiracy theorist
and you don't know this.

467
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,070
I just want to know what
geospatial intelligence is.

468
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,830
It's probably something simple and
now I'm going to look like an idiot.

469
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,790
It says it's intelligence about the
human activity on earth derive from the

470
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,820
exploitation and analysis of imagery and
geospatial information that describes,

471
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,330
assesses and visually depicts physical
features and geographically referenced

472
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,020
activities on the Earth.

473
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,130
I mean this is,

474
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,980
I think that's how we would know like
that North Korea has a bomb size of

475
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,960
satellites.

476
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,510
Satellite Imagery I think.

477
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,201
I guess,

478
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:14,351
well,

479
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,120
there's probably a satellite agency too.

480
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,740
I think we've uncovered a scam.

481
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,300
I think we've uncovered a
pretend agency that nobody in,

482
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,370
that there's a guy right
now panicked in the table.

483
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,490
Spatial 16,000 other employees going,

484
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:27,941
shit,

485
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,380
we're going to have to find a real job.

486
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,330
We would study and
shipping docs from space.

487
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,511
Yeah,

488
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:35,500
we just got outed.

489
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:35,681
Yeah.

490
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,514
What did they

491
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,531
just got outed on?

492
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:40,620
Rogan is completely [inaudible].

493
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,760
It's not really there.

494
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,990
That was an actress.

495
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,041
100%.

496
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,060
That's an actress.

497
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,961
But this is what I mean,

498
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:47,321
if you could,

499
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,400
if you look into this stuff,

500
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,720
it starts to get crazy.

501
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,040
The amount of people that are doing

502
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,281
things,

503
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:53,190
we have no idea what they're,

504
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,571
I mean,

505
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:54,404
10.

506
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,620
I just did a private Gig at the
Bethesda country club in Maryland.

507
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,670
Okay.

508
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,150
It's,

509
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,481
you know,

510
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm still doing it.

511
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,490
Private gigs say,

512
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,390
but you gotta you know,

513
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,420
it is got to do what you gotta do.

514
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,370
How to do what you gotta do.

515
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,650
I go to the Bethesda
Contra called Maryland.

516
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,513
Um,

517
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,940
it's the entire 10 counties
around Washington DC are
the wealthiest counties in

518
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:13,850
the world.

519
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,151
I mean,

520
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:14,261
in,

521
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,094
in our country,

522
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,561
they,

523
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,390
and it's not because
they're selling crab cakes,

524
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,230
you know what I mean?

525
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,910
It's all defense industry,

526
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,900
Raytheon,

527
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,400
uh,

528
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,650
you know,

529
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,210
DynCorp things you've never heard of.

530
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:23,741
And they're all there.

531
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:24,021
And they were,

532
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:24,741
it was a good gig.

533
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,191
They were funny.

534
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,030
I got up and I was like,

535
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:26,690
what are we,

536
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:26,801
oh,

537
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,400
we a carving up Venezuela.

538
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:28,731
They all,

539
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:30,950
after all clapping there in new way,

540
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,671
you know,

541
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:32,350
they liked it.

542
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,570
They,

543
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,403
some people get mad.

544
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,641
I was,

545
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,850
like I said,

546
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,520
last week I did a fundraiser
for human trafficking victims.

547
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,870
This week I'm with the traffickers.

548
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,010
You guys were a lot more fun.

549
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,060
And they're clapping.

550
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,420
They're clean,

551
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:41,901
they love it.

552
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,780
They're leaning in to being good.

553
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,463
They're,

554
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,270
they're,

555
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,840
you know,

556
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,220
they're morally compromise.

557
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,521
Well,

558
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:52,040
there also hired a
comedian to fuck with them.

559
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,460
Yes,

560
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,293
that's a good point.

561
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,601
I mean,

562
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,460
they expected,

563
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,910
it's not like that came out of nowhere.

564
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,360
Well,

565
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,631
you know,

566
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:56,871
I mean,

567
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:57,171
it's like,

568
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:57,741
so that's the thing.

569
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:58,670
It's like Trump bad,

570
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,880
but I don't know what the
geospatial people are too.

571
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,960
I don't have to,

572
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,480
I don't want to throw my hat in
with geospatial intelligence.

573
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,620
Yeah.

574
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,610
I don't know what that means.

575
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:07,851
I mean,

576
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:08,690
maybe we need it,

577
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,920
you know?

578
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,920
But listen again to standup comedians
talking about what the world needs.

579
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,560
Yeah,

580
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,340
it's not great.

581
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,450
It's fucking terrible,

582
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,000
right?

583
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,340
I mean,

584
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,920
I've been trying to stress this more than
ever because of the fact that I have a

585
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:22,731
microphone.

586
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,031
Right.

587
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,110
And people are listening.

588
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,060
Don't fucking pay attention to me.

589
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,800
Okay.

590
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,890
I am not right.

591
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,161
Well,

592
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:28,994
the best thing is,

593
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,910
listen,

594
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,270
you don't,

595
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,711
you don't know.

596
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:31,560
You might be right.

597
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:31,791
You're right.

598
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,170
But I'm definitely not an expert.

599
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,220
The best thing is if you go on Twitter
and a comedian will tweet something

600
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,054
really,

601
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:38,931
you know,

602
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,910
it's like we're living in
fascism and then again,

603
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,550
like 400,000 likes and
then the next tweet,

604
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,630
have you ever seen this to go?

605
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,310
And while you guys are here,

606
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,260
check out my web series

607
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,411
and he'd go,

608
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:51,771
are we,

609
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:52,880
are we living in fat?

610
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,560
If we're living in fascism,

611
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,040
you too.

612
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,140
I have a web series.

613
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,970
You can't have a Webster's.

614
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,970
And do I have the time to luxuriate in
your web series or should I start arming

615
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,314
myself?

616
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,503
Throw the gun?

617
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,673
What should I,

618
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,880
what should I look at my phone?

619
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:08,091
I'm like,

620
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,140
which way should I go?

621
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,191
But that's all they do.

622
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:10,611
They go by,

623
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:10,971
by the way,

624
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:11,804
while you're here,

625
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,550
I have a patriot.

626
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,440
We're doing a project.

627
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,910
I'd like you to throw a few bucks there,

628
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,250
but we're living in fascism and you know,

629
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,750
well the signal to noise ratio
in terms of like people tweeting,

630
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,970
it's almost mostly noise.

631
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,151
Oh,

632
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:26,690
it's nice.

633
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,100
There's a few people that are great.

634
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:31,370
You could fall a few people that
are really posting about real news.

635
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:34,160
And for some journalists,

636
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,240
17 of them,

637
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,600
I think journalists are maybe the best
people to follow on Twitter right now it

638
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:39,434
seems like.

639
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,300
But the problem is who's a journalist?

640
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:44,930
There's very few real
journalism takes a long time.

641
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,850
It's expensive.

642
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:48,200
Like real investigative journalism.

643
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,034
And I've had some of these guys,

644
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,681
my podcast,

645
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:50,161
they come on,

646
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:50,994
they go,

647
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,050
they've ruined their life.

648
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,580
They spend five years
looking into something.

649
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:54,361
Nobody cares about it.

650
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:55,320
They figured out it was true.

651
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:55,381
And,

652
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:56,640
and nobody wants to talk to them.

653
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,990
They will have white hair.

654
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,190
They're families hate them.

655
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,080
They live in a little
apartment in New York City.

656
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,370
That's a journalist.

657
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:02,581
Well,

658
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,140
sometimes people do journalism,

659
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:04,500
right,

660
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,240
and they,

661
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,090
they do spend a long time working on a
project and it's in something like the

662
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,190
New York Times and no one cares.

663
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,001
No one cares.

664
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:12,900
Like the thing about Trump,

665
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,040
like the report on Trump,

666
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,240
this scathing report,

667
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,290
they thought it was
going to bring them down.

668
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,260
Literally it was in and out of
the news cycle on a day or two.

669
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:19,351
Yeah.

670
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:19,920
They don't care.

671
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,650
That guy just pops an extra
Adderall and doesn't give up.

672
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:23,460
He doesn't care.

673
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,200
He doesn't give a fuck.

674
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:28,330
He is the only guy that should ever
write a motivational HealthSouth hop

675
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,200
the secret.

676
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,560
Right.

677
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,520
Whenever the secret is,

678
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:33,240
he's got it.

679
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,073
I think it's speed.

680
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,460
It's speed.

681
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,270
You think he's really,

682
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,740
yeah.

683
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:36,961
Yeah,

684
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:37,340
I do.

685
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,173
Yeah.

686
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,180
I think it's speed.

687
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,560
I think he's on something.

688
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,071
I mean,

689
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:44,520
I think this is the only way that it
makes sense to me that a 70 plus year old

690
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,630
man has that much energy.

691
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,730
A guy doesn't exercise,

692
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:48,780
eats fast food,

693
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,430
and he's fucking bouncing off the walls
and he can campaign for days and days.

694
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,170
Just,

695
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:54,550
Ooh,

696
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:54,991
KFC,

697
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,610
double downs and flay a fishes.

698
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:57,690
And let me ask you this,

699
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,470
how often,

700
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,260
if he gets his dick sucked and question,

701
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,011
who's doing it?

702
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,870
Great question and not asked enough,

703
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,380
right?

704
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,640
Probably not that much.

705
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:08,220
I don't think a guy like
that is driven by sex.

706
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,661
I don't get that.

707
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:10,770
Maybe he'd be,

708
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:15,540
but Milania seems to
be not into it as much.

709
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,440
It seems a little upset with them.

710
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,520
She seems a bit cold,

711
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,110
but there she Slovenian or something,

712
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,093
something like that.

713
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,933
They're cold.

714
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,550
I don't know.

715
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:21,700
That's,

716
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,280
well that's some of the generalizations.

717
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,821
They're white,

718
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,990
so I can generally say
what I want about them.

719
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,760
Ciao.

720
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,270
Okay.

721
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,500
Let me say what the Hell I want.

722
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,240
And Eastern Europeans.

723
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,820
Can I not have Slovenians you can.

724
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,181
Okay,

725
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:33,980
thank you.

726
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,290
Ah,

727
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,123
she's called.

728
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,491
Well,

729
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:35,641
she,

730
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,020
I think she's a little annoyed with them,

731
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,141
you know what I mean?

732
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,050
She was very humiliating for her.

733
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,130
They had the pest life.

734
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,521
Yeah.

735
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,930
Up until he ran for president.

736
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,470
He,

737
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:43,711
I mean,

738
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:44,730
imagine telling his kids,

739
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:45,031
he's like,

740
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,380
I know you got world billionaires,

741
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,940
you'll party every day.

742
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,710
You do coke with impunity.

743
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,260
It's some New York City nightclub.

744
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,440
When you boarded that,

745
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,274
you go to Europe,

746
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,250
do it on a boat when you bought it
that you go to some origene Athens,

747
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,570
that's all done right.

748
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,650
But we're going to Canton,

749
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:03,090
Ohio and I'm giving a speech
and you can stand there because,

750
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,110
and every camera,

751
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,770
every news reporter is going to watch
every move you make the rest of your life

752
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,680
you're going to crawl up your ass with
a microscope to and everyone hates you

753
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,380
and some of them might be going to jail.

754
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,621
I mean,

755
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:13,981
we don't,

756
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:16,860
we really don't know what's going
on with this Mueller investigation.

757
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,491
And I think a lot,

758
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:17,761
I mean,

759
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:18,930
I think it's going to be disappointing.

760
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,030
Everybody's preparing
anything for disappointment.

761
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,490
Everybody has prepared
us for disappointment.

762
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:23,980
Yeah.

763
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,000
CNN is actually was saying
that that don't expect much.

764
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,130
It's like when you get a report
card and you'd tell your parents,

765
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:29,964
you're like,

766
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:30,421
no,

767
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:33,680
I've changed but I'm still
me still know what I mean.

768
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,540
I'm still the guy who gets high before
he goes into school and was caught

769
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,600
smoking by the priests.

770
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,710
Like I used to get caught smoking weed
by the priest who driving it in my

771
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,630
Catholic school and he would
drive me to the school.

772
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,561
So I would be like,

773
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:46,711
yeah,

774
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,070
I've made some changes,

775
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,790
but I'm still very much that
person that you guys raised.

776
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,080
So that I think is what the Mueller
report is going to be like Trump.

777
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,730
But the thing about Trump is he's corrupt.

778
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,140
He's a con man,

779
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,981
you know,

780
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:02,290
he said he had this whole
wall that there was no wall.

781
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:02,981
Well,

782
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:03,814
this is not coming.

783
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,663
Little links,

784
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,620
the walls,

785
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,940
not in some wall.

786
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,133
There's no wall.

787
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,490
This is a little signs.

788
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:10,630
It's a finished the wall.

789
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,411
But this part,

790
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,670
this part of a wall,

791
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,573
there's more,

792
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,230
there's more of a wallet
around houses in Belair,

793
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,760
right.

794
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,930
Then there is at the border.

795
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,681
But you know,

796
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:21,620
it's a smaller area,

797
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:22,454
a pillar.

798
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,781
It's,

799
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,110
yeah.

800
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,120
And there's probably more
of a reason to have a wall,

801
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,081
you know,

802
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:28,420
and the people that run bel
air or probably more serious.

803
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,470
Yeah,

804
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:29,710
yeah.

805
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,850
That's definitely something that,

806
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,751
you know,

807
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:31,900
I,

808
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,280
I don't know,

809
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,020
uh,

810
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,470
about this whole wall thing.

811
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,160
I really feel like it was
one of those campaigns,

812
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:39,700
slogans that he got stuck with,

813
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:39,971
you know,

814
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:40,990
build that wall.

815
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
And then once he got in he was like,

816
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:42,971
oh Christ,

817
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:44,320
I really got to build this fucking thing.

818
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,370
It's his slogan,

819
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,080
someone whispered into his ear,

820
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
you think he and culture probably said,

821
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:50,920
get out there and say build the wall.

822
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,311
And he goes,

823
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,144
that's good.

824
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,740
And then you just went out there,

825
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,850
build that wall.

826
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,900
I love the,

827
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,010
one of the speeches,

828
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,360
he doesn't really build things.

829
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,850
He lent his name to be franchised.

830
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:01,571
Yeah,

831
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,351
he definitely does that.

832
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:05,530
He's not a bit like this idea that he's
like a bit the things he's built or

833
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:06,364
disgusting.

834
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,170
If you go to Atlantic city,

835
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,290
what can any building
he has built it is to,

836
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,760
Chris Hedges wrote a book,

837
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
he's an interesting guy.

838
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,850
He wrote a book called America,

839
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,770
the farewell tour and he goes,

840
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:18,350
he went,

841
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,840
he went to Trump tower in Atlantic city.

842
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:20,380
He goes,

843
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,820
there's junkies in the bathrooms,

844
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:25,690
does like rats running
around is falling apart.

845
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:26,231
And he's like,

846
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:27,940
that's kind of what you
know America will be,

847
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,350
but no anything he's built.

848
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:30,184
He's not nice.

849
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,151
Did you watch it?

850
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:35,160
There was a documentary about an architect
called Costas carry on us and he had,

851
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:39,730
and a lot of the documentary is about
him convincing Trump to not make his

852
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:43,910
building gold in New York City and I,

853
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,040
and it's like,

854
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,380
is it Golden New York City?

855
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,600
But it's Golden Vegas
gold a lot of places.

856
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,760
But like he was going to ruin the,

857
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,310
the downtown of Manhattan
with a gold building.

858
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,280
Why is that ruining it though?

859
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,750
A gold building.

860
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,350
Why not?

861
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,270
You've spent too much
time on the west coast,

862
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,200
but why is that bad?

863
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:04,510
Why is it bad for it to be one car?

864
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,270
Is it better if it's all
black or all white or silver?

865
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:07,871
It's a look.

866
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:08,830
It has a feel.

867
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,480
You can't come in with a gold building.

868
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,350
It's not Vegas.

869
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,520
It's not Atlantic city.

870
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,321
This is not right.

871
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:13,930
You know,

872
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,890
like Mandalay Bay,

873
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,570
what goes on in a gold building.

874
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,130
I've never looked at a
gold building and said,

875
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,870
I bet what goes on there is honest,

876
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,910
like decent gold buildings should
be for doing coke and losing money.

877
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,680
That's what it's about.

878
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,870
You don't walk in with a
building and get a checkup.

879
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,281
That's good point.

880
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:30,530
Yeah.

881
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:30,940
Yeah.

882
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,870
That was a very good point.

883
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,063
Gaudy.

884
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,150
It's disgusting.

885
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,660
Yeah.

886
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,001
God,

887
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:36,761
he is a weird thing,

888
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:37,060
right?

889
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,601
Like who's that?

890
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:38,500
Who's that good for?

891
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Like when you go to a place and it's got
opulent Chandelier's guilded furniture,

892
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,750
sociopaths who sacrifice human beings.

893
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,390
That's the way they want to lift.

894
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,350
They want to live in a,

895
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:50,920
uh,

896
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,510
a palatial opulent environment.

897
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,890
And then just,

898
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,370
you know,

899
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:55,990
I think Matt,

900
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,391
he be,

901
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,224
he said this,

902
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,330
he said that Trump is a poor
person's idea of a rich person.

903
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,164
Absolutely.

904
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,210
That's what a rich person thinks.

905
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,720
When a poor person thinks
about a rich person,

906
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:07,190
they think,

907
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,371
oh,

908
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:10,040
he's got his name on his jet and
he's got his name on his building.

909
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,630
And the guys I grew up
with in long island,

910
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,890
if somebody went to them and said,

911
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:13,580
hey,

912
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,950
you could own the Miss Universe pageant.

913
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,740
You could have a building
with your name on it.

914
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,230
You could be in the WWE,

915
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,850
that would be amazing.

916
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,840
You'd be a winner.

917
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,710
They would be a winner.

918
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,360
Where I grew up in long island,

919
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:27,230
that would be,

920
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,940
that is the highest you can go.

921
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,500
So I think that's kind of what it is.

922
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,483
It's a very,

923
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,420
what's,

924
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,260
see what's appealing.

925
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,580
That's also what's appealing about them.

926
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,970
What's appealing about
him is there is no veneer,

927
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,330
right?

928
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,160
You don't get the idea
that you're being played,

929
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,480
you get the idea,

930
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,770
you know you're kind of being played,

931
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:45,080
but you're being played on
a level that you accept.

932
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,060
It's like when you go buy a
car and you know the salesman,

933
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,260
I used to be in sales,

934
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,030
so like when I'll go to buy something,

935
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:52,970
sometimes I know the salesman
needs the sale because I used to.

936
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,290
So like sometimes it'd be like,

937
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:54,381
yeah,

938
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:55,970
whatever it is what it is,

939
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,960
you know,

940
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,320
I just,

941
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,153
I'll do it.

942
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,330
That's kind of with Trump,

943
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,320
you know you're being sold,

944
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:01,250
but you're okay with it.

945
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,690
You let it happen.

946
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,610
What do you think is
going to come after him?

947
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,380
It seems like he's throwing a
giant monkey wrench into the gears.

948
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,790
Twitter is any indication,

949
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,650
a prolonged civil conflict,

950
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,603
uh,

951
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,013
where there will be,

952
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,850
where some will emerge as
a few different nation.

953
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,790
States will barter with each other.

954
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,570
Um,

955
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:23,961
I don't know,

956
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,730
maybe Joe Biden and then nothing.

957
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,020
He's got no chance.

958
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,331
He's,

959
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:28,200
he's who do you,

960
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:29,034
who's coming.

961
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,340
She's got no chance.

962
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:31,731
Bernie.

963
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,564
They hate now.

964
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,450
They hate me.

965
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,790
Know a lot of people hate Bernie.

966
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,450
What happened?

967
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,283
I don't know it,

968
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,840
some kind of staff was
accused of sexual assault.

969
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,651
Oh,

970
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,520
and now they hate burning.

971
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,300
He's a rapist.

972
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,421
Well,

973
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:41,571
that's,

974
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:41,841
you know,

975
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,680
that's what happens.

976
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,783
Bernie's,

977
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:44,931
he's a white,

978
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:45,890
straight male.

979
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:46,724
He doesn't get it.

980
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,530
He doesn't get it.

981
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,090
Plus he has like two houses.

982
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,790
He's worth like $300,000.

983
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:53,690
You know,

984
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,710
that offends people.

985
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,580
Yeah.

986
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,490
How'd you get that money off the
backs of poor people in a country,

987
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:58,821
by the way,

988
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,160
where people make that a
in and hour on youtube.

989
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,611
You know,

990
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:02,444
some people do

991
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,511
Logan,

992
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:06,350
Paul and all those guys.

993
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:07,190
Those guys,

994
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,090
you know,

995
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,260
you see people in la.

996
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:10,760
I'll see a kid in la on a skateboard.

997
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:10,971
I'm like,

998
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:11,804
he's a millionaire.

999
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,380
He owns three houses because
he used youtube live streamer.

1000
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:15,681
Yeah.

1001
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,540
He's probably playing
video games on twitch.

1002
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,120
Yeah.

1003
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,470
Everything my parents told
me to do go to school.

1004
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,580
That implies impoverished my generation,

1005
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,260
everything they told us not to do,

1006
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:25,370
which is play video games,

1007
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:26,031
watch TV,

1008
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:28,220
get high is making people billionaires.

1009
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,000
It's amazing.

1010
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,360
Yeah,

1011
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,193
they were wrong.

1012
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,150
They were definitely wrong.

1013
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,330
Boomers were wrong about everything.

1014
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,010
Well they didn't see this coming.

1015
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,750
They didn't see this craziness come
in and see any of that come in.

1016
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,080
You know what concerns me is,

1017
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:39,983
uh,

1018
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,480
the rise of people that think
that everyone owes them something.

1019
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,210
Sure.

1020
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,371
You know,

1021
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:46,580
that's,

1022
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,130
that's the door.

1023
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,300
That's the weird one.

1024
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:50,660
Like we were talking about AOC who,

1025
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,150
you know,

1026
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,940
said she seems like a nice
girls cause looking woman.

1027
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:54,661
She's young,

1028
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:55,650
she's got energy,

1029
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,330
she wants to do good things.

1030
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,740
She wants to do some good ones.

1031
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,600
But I saw the one thing that said
give money to people who are unable or

1032
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,070
unwilling to work.

1033
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,431
Yeah.

1034
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:05,720
That's,

1035
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I saw that and I'm like,

1036
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,470
I'm going to work.

1037
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:07,981
Well it's not,

1038
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:09,000
and they pulled that out.

1039
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,050
They pulled that part out.

1040
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:12,810
The unwilling park in her unable
to work makes total sense.

1041
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:13,061
You know,

1042
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:13,130
we,

1043
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,980
we as a community,

1044
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:14,940
we should take care of the people.

1045
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:17,490
Most of the people that are now
in comedy or unable to work,

1046
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,120
most of us,

1047
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,881
most of us,

1048
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:19,260
yes.

1049
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,430
This is the only thing we can do.

1050
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,990
But her thing was a
weird one because that,

1051
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,843
that thing,

1052
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,960
unwilling to work.

1053
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,320
It's like,

1054
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,880
hey,

1055
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,713
hey.

1056
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,683
He just,

1057
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,750
he just crossed over into
crazy town like this is,

1058
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,350
but that means that crazy
town was always in the back.

1059
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,700
You always had that.

1060
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,331
Yeah.

1061
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:37,650
When you put that on paper,

1062
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,900
that means this is something
that's been discussed,

1063
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,580
like part of the appeal and she just,

1064
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:44,730
I don't know how influential she wasn't
getting Amazon to drop out in New York,

1065
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,990
but I live in Queens,

1066
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:46,980
so everyone is paranoid.

1067
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:48,000
Amazon was coming,

1068
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,380
was a Bagel.

1069
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:49,501
I,

1070
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,011
no carbs,

1071
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:50,311
no good.

1072
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:51,330
But I was in a Bagel shop.

1073
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,270
I gave up dairy two weeks ago.

1074
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,193
I'm turning it around,

1075
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,103
trying to get around.

1076
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,010
I was in a Bagel shop.

1077
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,170
It was paranoid about Amazon.

1078
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,380
Amazon is going to come.

1079
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:02,070
We're all going to get priced out of my
little shoebox is it we live in or the,

1080
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,570
some of the people that own
those shoe boxes were like,

1081
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:07,700
I'm a millionaire now because
Amazon's coming and the,

1082
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,730
but here's the thing,

1083
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,320
it's hard to have a rational discussion
about a co inequality right now because

1084
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:14,490
in a place like New York City,

1085
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,300
it's so expensive to live and the reason
for that is that it's a destination for

1086
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,460
foreign capital.

1087
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,860
So essentially a lot of the
buildings in New York City,

1088
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,960
foreign people buy apartments.

1089
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:25,794
They don't live in them.

1090
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,820
They use it to like launder money and
they buy them not even under their real

1091
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:30,031
name.

1092
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:34,380
They buy them under the name of a Shell
Corp like an LLC and then they have like

1093
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,360
these investments and it,

1094
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,790
it really makes everything
insanely expensive.

1095
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,870
That's what's making everything.

1096
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,970
That's what's making a lot of
real estate in New York City.

1097
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:42,600
Expensive.

1098
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,660
What do you what like what if you got to
guess what percentage of like expensive

1099
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,660
apartments are owned by?

1100
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:46,981
I'll tell you,

1101
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:51,981
between 2008 and 2014 I
think 50% of apartments going
into contract were cause I

1102
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:52,681
do a shell,

1103
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:53,001
but I,

1104
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:56,310
I used to be a double decker tour guide
in New York City and so I do a show,

1105
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:58,140
like a funny comedy show where I take,

1106
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,071
I sell tickets,

1107
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,740
I put people on a tour bus and then
we'd go around to these building,

1108
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,510
just scream at these buildings.

1109
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,320
It's fun.

1110
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,153
It should be illegal,

1111
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,660
but it's fun and,

1112
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,170
and no one cares because they're
not home because there somewhere,

1113
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,100
I mean it feeling,

1114
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,480
if you look at who owns these buildings,

1115
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:16,500
just a guy who like is maybe a guy who
owns a mining company and he poisoned to

1116
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:17,460
river in Zambia.

1117
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,430
The a lot of these guys are doing things
they shouldn't be doing and they want

1118
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,740
to stash their money in real estate.

1119
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:23,990
London is insane.

1120
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,590
It's more expensive than New York
because London is all essentially shell

1121
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:29,520
corporations.

1122
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,570
You know these phantom buyers
buying up real estate in London,

1123
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,140
in New York.

1124
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,020
So you have people in New York
that know the system is fucked.

1125
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,600
They know the markets being
artificially manipulated.

1126
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,890
Bloomberg thought it was great.

1127
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,471
Bloomberg is,

1128
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:42,760
we want all of the billionaires.

1129
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,361
He said it,

1130
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:44,110
that was his quote.

1131
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,943
We want all the bay.

1132
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,580
It's like some of those billionaires have
done things that would make you would

1133
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:50,170
keep you up at night.

1134
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:50,680
They've,

1135
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,230
you know,

1136
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,870
numbers like bring them in,

1137
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,520
they eat shrimp and steak,

1138
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,730
they'll go to Peter Luger's.

1139
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,530
We love him as a businessman.

1140
00:29:59,531 --> 00:29:59,711
Right?

1141
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:00,191
That's a thing.

1142
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:02,230
So people get fed up with death and dude,

1143
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:02,830
and when I was,

1144
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,663
had my tour bus,

1145
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,920
people would get on from regular places
like Pennsylvania now just point and go

1146
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,983
10 million,

1147
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,243
20 million,

1148
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,111
30 minute.

1149
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:12,190
And these people just shift
uncomfortably in their seats.

1150
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:14,260
Like what the Hell is going on here?

1151
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:14,771
This is the,

1152
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,071
you know,

1153
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:19,870
I saw Trump getting elected during those
tours because I'm like $100 million and

1154
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:20,704
they're like sitting there like,

1155
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,850
what?

1156
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,380
I can't afford a knee operation.

1157
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:23,681
Well,

1158
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:26,070
the idea that Trump's not a
part of that as he increases,

1159
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,130
listen in his bit,

1160
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,110
his building was a huge destination.

1161
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,580
Russians love his building.

1162
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,511
They love it.

1163
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:32,410
They love a brand name.

1164
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,460
They love the plaza.

1165
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,840
They love his building,

1166
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,110
and a lot of interesting
characters lived in Trump tower.

1167
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,920
Didn't they take the Trump tower
name off of it in New York?

1168
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,300
Yeah.

1169
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,580
Wasn't,

1170
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:42,761
no,

1171
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:43,594
I don't want to else.

1172
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,690
There was one of the buildings where
the people that own the co op decided to

1173
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:47,590
take the name off of it.

1174
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,990
Maybe there's another,

1175
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,150
there's a lot of shitty like
Trump nursing homes too,

1176
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,630
as I've been in New York.

1177
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:52,991
Oh yes.

1178
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:53,681
Nursing homes,

1179
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:55,420
you know those elderly
people getting beaten.

1180
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:56,254
It's hard to say

1181
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:58,780
Joe.

1182
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,021
You know,

1183
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:00,010
they're getting fleeced.

1184
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:00,844
The beaten.

1185
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,571
You go by,

1186
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:03,010
you see like Trump pavilion.

1187
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,350
It's like a Soviet era architecture.

1188
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:08,770
Horrible like old age home that's
been there since the 70s and I'm like,

1189
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:09,341
man,

1190
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:11,140
I feel for the people in there,

1191
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,910
the screams,

1192
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,830
it must other New York condo
votes to remove Trump from name.

1193
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,053
Yeah,

1194
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,440
New York City condominium.

1195
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,161
On Thursday,

1196
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,470
we removed president Trump's
name from the buildings facade.

1197
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,790
The second time at four months,

1198
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,830
his name has been removed
from a condo in the city.

1199
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:32,130
55% of Trump plays condo owners at
120 Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan.

1200
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:36,550
Voted in favor of removing the
large sign above the front door,

1201
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,620
the buildings.

1202
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,740
I mean that crazy.

1203
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,640
Who Cares?

1204
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,500
These are self important people,

1205
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,610
but when care is,

1206
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:43,470
they're worried about their,

1207
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,680
their secure attachment.

1208
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,341
Oh,

1209
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:46,150
that's a good point.

1210
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:46,690
Yeah.

1211
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,590
I think if you try to sell it and it's
Trump place and you know you're going to

1212
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:54,640
eliminate 50% of your buyers dictators
that are buying those apartments,

1213
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,660
I think it's great.

1214
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,120
They die.

1215
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,971
Maybe they don't.

1216
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:58,631
Maybe they're like,

1217
00:31:58,631 --> 00:31:59,440
you know,

1218
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,260
probably we'll probably go down the
street to this no name building.

1219
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:03,130
We'll be better off.

1220
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,950
But a lot of his condos were sold to,

1221
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,350
you know,

1222
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,430
Mafia and you know,

1223
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,030
Russian business guys and
he's always hide that,

1224
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,230
you know,

1225
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:11,891
he did deals.

1226
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,560
It was his firm located in Trump
tower called Bay rock financial,

1227
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:15,400
which was a,

1228
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,330
it was headed by this guy,

1229
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,050
Felix Sader.

1230
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,780
Felix Sater was a guy who the FBI,

1231
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,330
uh,

1232
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,790
convicted in like a Russian
pump and dumps stock scam.

1233
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,910
And he worked in Trump tower with Trump.

1234
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,750
Like he worked very closely with
Trump and Felix had like informed,

1235
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:32,140
I think on the Russian mob for the
feds and the feds kind of let him earn.

1236
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,070
And so Trump has had this labyrinth
of shady connections forever.

1237
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,790
Wow.

1238
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,680
And I don't know if that
means that he's ness.

1239
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't think he's an asset or
of Putin or anything like that.

1240
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:41,870
I don't believe that.

1241
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,550
I think that's kind of just,

1242
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,503
you know,

1243
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,081
I think it's,

1244
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:46,940
a lot of people would
like to believe that,

1245
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,620
but he's a shady guy.

1246
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,390
So if you have all these people pouring
over his business deals for the last 50

1247
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:53,990
years,

1248
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,830
it can't be good.

1249
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,620
There could be an amazing movie about him.

1250
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:57,771
Oh,

1251
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:58,604
there will be.

1252
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,380
And who would play him?

1253
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,340
Ah,

1254
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,173
good question.

1255
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,590
Hopefully not a white man.

1256
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:04,424
Christian Bale.

1257
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,090
Uh,

1258
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,990
let them get fat.

1259
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,310
Just like he did with Dick Cheney.

1260
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:07,840
We played Dick.

1261
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,870
If he could play Dick Cheney,

1262
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:09,880
he can do Trump.

1263
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,790
He can put a truck.

1264
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,660
He was a great Cheney.

1265
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,830
I thought I heard.

1266
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:13,800
I haven't seen him yet.

1267
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,690
I heard it was amazing.

1268
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,180
I,

1269
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,970
you know the movie with
like a lot of people,

1270
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,230
the movie was good.

1271
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:19,010
It was not,

1272
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:19,460
you know,

1273
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,740
it's like the big short to me was amazing.

1274
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,820
I don't think it was as good as that,

1275
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,790
but Christian Bale is phenomenal.

1276
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,840
He's a phenomenal act.

1277
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:27,950
I mean,

1278
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,300
to gain that much weight,

1279
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,950
to become another person.

1280
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,220
That's all thing with Jesse Small.

1281
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,670
It's like they're all,

1282
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,340
all these actors are sociopaths.

1283
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,390
They're all sociopaths.

1284
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,550
Watches Good Morning America
interview and try not to laugh.

1285
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,890
Well now it's,

1286
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:42,980
it's crazy what he said.

1287
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,360
He's the gay Tupac like

1288
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,560
85 back and great.

1289
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:49,400
Those guys like,

1290
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,300
oh my God,

1291
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:53,090
crisis PR firm is telling him to do that.

1292
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,290
The Gay Tupac,

1293
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,580
no one's telling them to do that.

1294
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:58,640
This is all so this is
Bridget Fetisi said it best.

1295
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,530
She says she's hilarious.

1296
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,101
She said,

1297
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,080
this is what happens when you
let actors write the script.

1298
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,231
Well,

1299
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:03,680
that's true.

1300
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,390
See the plot twist coming a mile away.

1301
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,630
I had dinner the other night.

1302
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,920
I was in La and an act was at the
table and he was talking and I'm like,

1303
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,240
I don't know who this guy is,

1304
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,310
but he's not even the
person he is at this table.

1305
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,711
Right,

1306
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:14,544
right.

1307
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,300
He's trying out a person right now.

1308
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,520
Have you ever been in that situation?

1309
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,590
I don't know who he is,

1310
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,730
but he's not this guy.

1311
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:23,780
He doesn't know who he is either.

1312
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:24,740
He says no clue.

1313
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,570
It's just good looking guy that vapid.

1314
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:27,351
He's full of nothing.

1315
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:31,010
He wants to get famous
asap and they say things.

1316
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,550
Oh yeah.

1317
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,720
Other people are saying,

1318
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,730
here's one good to see you.

1319
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:35,210
Yes.

1320
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:35,931
When they meet you,

1321
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,261
they say,

1322
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:38,670
good to see you because they might have
met you and they don't want to forget

1323
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,760
100% so I've said that before.

1324
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:41,511
Nice to me and they're like,

1325
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:42,440
actually we met before.

1326
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,340
I'm like fuck.

1327
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,280
They'll ask in a very strange way,

1328
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:46,790
they'll be like,

1329
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,623
what's going on?

1330
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,183
Like what's up?

1331
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,001
What's going on?

1332
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:50,480
Like you want it,

1333
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,030
they want it.

1334
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,351
You want,

1335
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,040
they want you,

1336
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,030
they want to be fed.

1337
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,890
They want to be fed information.

1338
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,490
Yeah.

1339
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,301
It's like what's going on?

1340
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:56,631
And I'm like,

1341
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:56,990
wow,

1342
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:57,823
you know,

1343
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,871
a lot of projects.

1344
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:00,650
He Shit Bro,

1345
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,270
guest spotted flappers Ah,

1346
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,400
lots of things happening and uh,

1347
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,480
cause you're always trying to move.

1348
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,590
That's the thing about La New York is
just pound yourself into the ground until

1349
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:10,424
you get funny.

1350
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,260
That's kind of what the New York scene,

1351
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,190
the New York scene is
like two 57 shows a day.

1352
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,110
Give up on your life,

1353
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,910
don't speak to your family,

1354
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,620
they're losers are holding it back.

1355
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,050
Go hard.

1356
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,270
La is like make a friend,

1357
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,133
have lunch,

1358
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,310
see what happens.

1359
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,770
I talked to some of the
people out here and I'm like,

1360
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:31,580
what's the plan?

1361
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,450
I get nervous for them.

1362
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,433
I'm like,

1363
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:35,751
they're getting high.

1364
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:36,650
It's mid day.

1365
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,650
I'm like,

1366
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,011
okay,

1367
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:38,970
it's Wednesday too.

1368
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:39,480
They're like,

1369
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,410
we just had a meeting.

1370
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:40,651
I'm like,

1371
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:41,484
what'd you do?

1372
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:41,941
They go,

1373
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,320
we're talking about starting a podcast.

1374
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:43,531
I'm like,

1375
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:44,370
that's not a meeting.

1376
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,710
You're just friends with someone else.

1377
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,200
You're talking about stuff that's nothing.

1378
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,310
But here's the thing,

1379
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,920
it does work here and there are people
that I know who've made the right friend

1380
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:53,940
and then their life changes.

1381
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:54,811
Yeah,

1382
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:55,800
there's a little of that.

1383
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,160
But those people were super transparent
and if you don't have any talent that's

1384
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:01,200
never going to never work.

1385
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,700
And then everybody resents you.

1386
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,340
There's a few of those people
that really don't have any talent,

1387
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:08,730
but they made the right friends and they
cling on to folks and everybody gets

1388
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,480
real uncomfortable.

1389
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,010
And that was thing,

1390
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,610
I think the first time
we spoke is I've written,

1391
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:13,980
I think about Louis and after
Louise and the whole news,

1392
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:14,814
but Louie happened,

1393
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,440
you had all this love that
piece by the accurate an honest,

1394
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,681
yeah,

1395
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:20,461
it was on Facebook,

1396
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:21,950
which where I did a lot of my best work.

1397
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,920
Blame what you were saying.

1398
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,020
[inaudible] didn't read it after Louis.

1399
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:29,610
A lot of people were rightly criticized
and conduct and you know the whole me

1400
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:30,080
too thing.

1401
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,280
That's all valid in short.

1402
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,520
100% needs to happen.

1403
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,110
But then there were people that were like,

1404
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:34,830
you know,

1405
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,500
Louie was never funny or Louie was just,

1406
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:37,801
you know,

1407
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,180
of course he got all these things.

1408
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,230
He was a white guy or,

1409
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:40,800
and I'm like,

1410
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,311
wait,

1411
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:41,850
what?

1412
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,331
And they were like,

1413
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:42,421
well,

1414
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:43,770
he said this word I don't like.

1415
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,570
Well look at this joke and I'm like,

1416
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,070
guys,

1417
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,410
a week ago he was a comic genius.

1418
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,370
We all agreed on that.

1419
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,840
That was a widely held belief.

1420
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,120
Now out of nowhere,

1421
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,260
he's not that funny.

1422
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,160
And,

1423
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,370
and these people are tweeting this from
parking lots where they're performing

1424
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,040
some of these shows in la or
in like someone's driveway,

1425
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,233
you know,

1426
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,350
and which is fine.

1427
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:04,861
I do them,

1428
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:05,694
I've no problem with that.

1429
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
But they're getting on Twitter and,

1430
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,740
and knocking Louis from the back of a
parking lot where they're doing a show.

1431
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,840
But what the reason you gave for why,

1432
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:13,230
well,

1433
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,140
because these,

1434
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,910
there's,

1435
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,080
in any industry,

1436
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:19,800
people are going to get
ahead by being agreeable,

1437
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,450
by having the right opinions,

1438
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,520
by crowd sourcing their opinions,

1439
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,350
by taking the temperature
of the room and going,

1440
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,820
how does everyone feel?

1441
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,790
And those people are,

1442
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,331
you know,

1443
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,490
they're careerists are very
good at office politics.

1444
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:34,560
They're very good at
having the right friends,

1445
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,710
but their contributions
are never really important,

1446
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:42,030
are long lasting because they never get
great because they don't take any risk.

1447
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,480
Because I think greatness is something
you have to risk constantly to get to

1448
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:48,504
that level.

1449
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,850
So a lot of these people do very well.

1450
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,684
They make money,

1451
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,200
they're,

1452
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,250
they're successful,

1453
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,300
but they are careerist and
they're looking for comfort.

1454
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,610
And so when it was comfortable and safe
to attack Louie and to bring Louie down

1455
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:03,900
and to elevate themselves,

1456
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,973
they did it.

1457
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,030
But they didn't do it when it could
have hurt their career a week earlier,

1458
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,163
you know?

1459
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,200
So to me it was very disingenuous and
the fact that more people weren't calling

1460
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:15,601
it out.

1461
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:15,711
And,

1462
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:15,981
and I,

1463
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:19,620
and I made that point where I said the
same thing on the other side of people

1464
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:20,760
who styled themselves.

1465
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,530
Like I'm a free speech warrior.

1466
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:28,050
I'm this anti PC in their
whole entire persona is,

1467
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,030
is that the need to say the n word?

1468
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,841
They're like,

1469
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,910
I can't do a joke if the
punchline isn't fact.

1470
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,541
Like they're like,

1471
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,374
we have to.

1472
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,160
So those to me are kind of the same

1473
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,910
people and they're the people that are
just trying to arrange the world in a way

1474
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:41,320
that allows them to succeed.

1475
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,030
Those are the types of people.

1476
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,140
Also like you were talking
about the actor in the retail,

1477
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,830
you mean they're,

1478
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,010
they're putting on a facade,

1479
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,310
not who they've adopted a
predetermined pattern or behavior.

1480
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:54,430
100% that predetermined
pattern of behavior might be,

1481
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,560
I'm a guy I drink every night.

1482
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:57,460
We go hard,

1483
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:57,730
right?

1484
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,570
I'm an artist,

1485
00:38:58,571 --> 00:38:59,620
I smoked cigarettes,

1486
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,330
I don't give a fuck.

1487
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:01,930
No,

1488
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,340
I'm not trying to get on TV.

1489
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:03,761
Yeah.

1490
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:06,150
So to me it was like
incredibly disingenuous.

1491
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:09,040
He had all these people and a lot of
them are angry and they're doing fine.

1492
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,200
Like some of them were talent.

1493
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:14,680
Like some of these people have their
own shows and they're getting angry at

1494
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,570
Louie and angry and I'm like there's,

1495
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,381
there's a real,

1496
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:18,101
because here's the thing,

1497
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:20,290
Ari Shaffir told me something that
made a lot of sense once he goes,

1498
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,660
it's,

1499
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,390
it can really be a waste to get into
this type of business and end up in an

1500
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:30,391
office writing for a show you don't
care about in a job you hate punching a

1501
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:31,384
clock.

1502
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,220
And that stuck with me and always take,

1503
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:37,390
it might be harder to go the other way
and to build a fan base and to do what

1504
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:38,224
you want,

1505
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,220
but it's going to be,

1506
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,070
it's going to be better in the end
and you're not going to be angry.

1507
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,690
You're not going to be resentful.

1508
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,910
And I think a lot of the people that
were were again shitting on his comedy,

1509
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,980
not so much his behavior,

1510
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:52,990
but it's comedy are people that are,

1511
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,910
would want more in this than they have.

1512
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:57,390
And they're resentful at
guys like Louie because it,

1513
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,170
it's not fair how talented he is.

1514
00:39:59,590 --> 00:39:59,771
Well,

1515
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,150
it's not just how talented he is,

1516
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,260
his work ethic,

1517
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:03,500
there's a lot of the factors,

1518
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,320
the risks that he does take.

1519
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,210
I mean,

1520
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:06,421
he,

1521
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:07,930
he says controversial things.

1522
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:08,651
He always has.

1523
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:09,670
Whether you agree or not.

1524
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:11,680
Like one of the things
about the Parkland thing,

1525
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,481
you know,

1526
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:13,690
and when he got in trouble about,

1527
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,230
uh,

1528
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,501
you know,

1529
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,930
saying that all you did was put
some fat kid out of the way.

1530
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,980
Yeah.

1531
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,920
That is so consistent with his material.

1532
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,550
Yeah.

1533
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,530
The idea that anybody's saying like,

1534
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,191
oh my God,

1535
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:25,150
he's punching down.

1536
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:30,151
Like you need to go review his material
again because he said a lot of risky

1537
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:35,620
shit because it was funny and he
had really good points about it.

1538
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,220
Yeah.

1539
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,900
Is that something that I would joke about?

1540
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:38,800
Probably not.

1541
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,220
Right,

1542
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,450
but he did.

1543
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,830
He wouldn't joke about fat people.

1544
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,250
Uh,

1545
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,083
yes I would,

1546
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,570
but I don't think I would
joke about kids getting shot.

1547
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,800
It's a tough take.

1548
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:48,851
Yeah.

1549
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:49,451
To make funny,

1550
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:50,090
but that's right.

1551
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:50,440
Yeah.

1552
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,760
But I think he could.

1553
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,380
I think honestly we were,

1554
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:54,220
you're dealing with,

1555
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:54,701
first of all,

1556
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,590
the embryo of a bit.

1557
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,130
I mean he's really only been doing
standup again for a couple of months in

1558
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,580
Pakistan.

1559
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,413
It was even less.

1560
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,690
And I think ultimately his idea that bed
is that bit rather is that kids today,

1561
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:11,890
like they want to be a VA and have them
when they have a 78 different genders.

1562
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,610
And why am I,

1563
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,630
why are you interesting?

1564
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,640
You're interesting because
you didn't get shot.

1565
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,110
That is his take on it.

1566
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:21,970
And he probably with overall reaction
and anticipation of reaction probably

1567
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,960
would have eliminated
that part of the bit.

1568
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:24,370
Sure.

1569
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,151
And you know what I'm saying?

1570
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,110
Like you know how it works.

1571
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,200
I'm still shocked.

1572
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,690
I think part of it is too,

1573
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:32,050
I was attracted to comedy because of
guys like Bill Hicks or Patricia people

1574
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:33,710
that can pick the things
that those guys said.

1575
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:36,260
You could only say on a stage
if you were really funny.

1576
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:36,830
Right.

1577
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,170
That's what I love about common.

1578
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,660
Me Too.

1579
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,280
That doesn't mean that
everyone has to love that.

1580
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:42,050
There is people that love it
for a million different reasons.

1581
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:42,440
Sure.

1582
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,400
But I love when Bill Hicks got
up and he said I was for the war,

1583
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,690
but against the troops.

1584
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,891
That's still,

1585
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:49,191
to me,

1586
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:51,530
one of the most amazing jokes
I've ever heard when he goes,

1587
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:52,640
we had a war in the states.

1588
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,250
I was in the unenviable
position of being for the war,

1589
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,323
but against the trip,

1590
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,040
it's like all those men living together.

1591
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,940
Yeah.

1592
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,340
I just don't like young
people or whatever.

1593
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:01,160
He fight.

1594
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,821
It's just great.

1595
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:02,150
I'm like,

1596
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:02,271
Oh,

1597
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:05,250
you couldn't say that in
a human resources May.

1598
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:06,530
You couldn't say that in an office.

1599
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,860
Right.

1600
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,611
He couldn't say that.

1601
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:09,170
If you were out to lunch
with a bunch of people,

1602
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:12,350
probably couldn't get away with
that unless you were really funny.

1603
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,810
But these guys have gotten
so funny and they've,

1604
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,650
you know,

1605
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,830
perfected their craft to the point where
they can get away with these things

1606
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,290
that the goal is to elicit laughter.

1607
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,041
It's not really,

1608
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,300
you're not going to change your mind,

1609
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:27,080
but the goal is to make you laugh about
something that's dark and horrible.

1610
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,000
That's what I love about calm.

1611
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:29,900
Yeah.

1612
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,790
It's some of my favorite material.

1613
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,070
Some of my favorite material is fucked up.

1614
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,450
It's wrong.

1615
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,940
You probably shouldn't have said
it would make me Howell out.

1616
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,050
Have you seen Holtzman?

1617
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,070
No.

1618
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,450
You never seen Brian Holtzman?

1619
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:41,870
No.

1620
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,570
Oh my God.

1621
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,380
Like store.

1622
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,180
Yeah.

1623
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,020
You should check them out.

1624
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,370
How long are you in town for?

1625
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,770
I'm a temporal of widely
early March for wedding.

1626
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,140
Oh,

1627
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,330
I'll call him back like a week.

1628
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:51,164
A month now.

1629
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:51,741
Well,

1630
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:52,580
he'll be here.

1631
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,400
I'm sure he's here either Friday or
Saturday cause he doesn't really do the

1632
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,150
road.

1633
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,650
He mostly just does the store.

1634
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:57,920
Yeah,

1635
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,360
I don't even think he does other clubs.

1636
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,750
I think I lost as a story
when I started in 94.

1637
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:03,650
He was coming up.

1638
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,960
He was there at the
store in [inaudible] 94.

1639
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,480
Wow.

1640
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:06,980
And uh,

1641
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,020
he was already there when
I got there and I was like,

1642
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:09,321
Whoa,

1643
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:10,370
this guy is going to be huge.

1644
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,750
And for whatever reason,

1645
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,613
he never left.

1646
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,640
He just does the store.

1647
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:14,480
But he's a legend,

1648
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,201
but it's the best room.

1649
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:15,381
I mean,

1650
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:16,730
I just did a few guest
spots here and I'm like,

1651
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:17,241
oh,

1652
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:18,680
this is the best room in the cut.

1653
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:19,520
Like I wouldn't leave.

1654
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:19,971
I'm like,

1655
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:20,804
this is amazing.

1656
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,160
Yeah,

1657
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,220
but you gotta leave.

1658
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,240
Like I'm doing the Improv tonight or what?

1659
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,430
I did the Improv the other night.

1660
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:29,270
I'm doing the Improv tomorrow and I
mix it up and I did the ice house last

1661
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,330
night.

1662
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,080
Right.

1663
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,800
I mix it up.

1664
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,191
You got,

1665
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,090
I think you have to,

1666
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,410
but it's the best room in the world.

1667
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,360
Is he one of those guys who does
this stuff where you're like,

1668
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:36,410
I can't believe I'm laughing.

1669
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,050
When Susan Smith drown her kids.

1670
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,380
Remember that he got gauge that night.

1671
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:44,900
He's like laser gentlemen heard.

1672
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:45,770
Those were bad kids.

1673
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,540
I heard they sat that closer to TV.

1674
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,130
They never put away their blocks.

1675
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,020
They're constantly spelt the fucking milk.

1676
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,220
Those kids would not be missed.

1677
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:52,901
It's all A's.

1678
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:53,270
I was like,

1679
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,800
Jesus Christ.

1680
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:55,220
Wow.

1681
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,850
Mitzi shore would not let him go onstage
after nine 11 she would not let him go

1682
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:02,870
and she told me because she was like,

1683
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:04,850
you were on the bench and how long?

1684
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:05,780
Like weeks.

1685
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,680
Oh my God.

1686
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,330
He got,

1687
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:08,891
she's like,

1688
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:10,220
don't let him on.

1689
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,370
He got benched after
nine 11 by Mitzi shore.

1690
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:14,204
That's great.

1691
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:14,960
Sure.

1692
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,520
Let you get away with fucking anything.

1693
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,560
That's a while now.

1694
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,600
And this is pre social media too.

1695
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,370
She wasn't worried about a tweet storm.

1696
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:22,810
No.

1697
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:23,643
No,

1698
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:24,260
you can't.

1699
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,100
It can't let him up.

1700
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,530
I love pre-twitter to not let someone up.

1701
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,240
It has to be so gracious.

1702
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:30,880
He's a fucking animal man.

1703
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:31,410
It's,

1704
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,460
he's so funny.

1705
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,860
He's so far the things
you laughed the heart,

1706
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:35,640
you know when you're,

1707
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,960
I was looking at it as like when I was
going through a Taco bell drive through

1708
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:40,350
in 11th grade and we were all stoned.

1709
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,090
The things you would make jokes,

1710
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:43,260
nobody in the car would ever go.

1711
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:44,100
That's too much.

1712
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,660
If they did get rid of them,

1713
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,500
they're done.

1714
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,651
They,

1715
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:47,280
you know,

1716
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,330
no one means that.

1717
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:48,961
No,

1718
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:51,750
we would let each other's families.

1719
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,100
You,

1720
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,360
my mother's just gets a phrenic.

1721
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,250
We would make fun of my mother,

1722
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,001
you know,

1723
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:57,541
and it,

1724
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:58,620
it was great.

1725
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,070
Yeah,

1726
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,910
I still do.

1727
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,540
Yeah.

1728
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,980
If you're someone in your
family's mental wheel,

1729
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:02,910
you're not making fun of them.

1730
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,121
Your,

1731
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:06,690
it's your problem because difference
is between east coast and west coast

1732
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:07,051
comedy.

1733
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:08,280
Is it west coast comedy?

1734
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:11,740
They hold that carrot of a Sitcom or uh,

1735
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,220
you know,

1736
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,820
hosting the tonight show or
something like that above your head.

1737
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,320
We had health insurance always there.

1738
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,960
East Coast comedy is just be funny,

1739
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,530
be funny till you die
and be funny and mean.

1740
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,780
There's a lot of meanness and
there's a lot of holes in the winter.

1741
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,980
It's cold and mean.

1742
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:26,600
And that's really,

1743
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:26,820
you know,

1744
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,230
it's real.

1745
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,770
But you know what I like about
west coast coming to choose,

1746
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,340
it's a lot of performing cause he's,

1747
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,203
the rooms are big.

1748
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:31,830
Yeah.

1749
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,960
And use your big east coast
rooms are a little smaller.

1750
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:35,250
She have a lot of like writers.

1751
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,140
I love the performing style so I kind
of like seeing people in the store with

1752
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:41,010
big acts.

1753
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,461
Yeah.

1754
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:43,320
There's not a lot of room to move.

1755
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,760
Like if you're at the stand or the seller,

1756
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,980
something you are a little small.

1757
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:47,341
Yeah,

1758
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,720
they're tight little rooms.

1759
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:52,530
You can't use [inaudible] on stage
performers in those rooms that rock out in

1760
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:53,290
the stroller.

1761
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,360
But like when I was in the store
I was like oh there's huge rooms.

1762
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,520
Big performers and that's awesome.

1763
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:00,690
Especially like the main room,

1764
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,830
the main room is amazing.

1765
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,940
Giant stage.

1766
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:03,390
Yeah,

1767
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,170
it is interesting.

1768
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,990
I like those really small
intimate rooms in New York.

1769
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:10,530
They lend themselves a lot to talking
to the crowd and being sharp and having

1770
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:12,870
really sharp bits that hit.

1771
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:14,910
And then I think,

1772
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:17,040
and that's why you get to go
everywhere because you need the,

1773
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:17,731
when you go on the road,

1774
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:18,001
you want to,

1775
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:19,230
you want a little bit of everything,

1776
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,570
you want to be able to perform
and you want to have sharp jokes,

1777
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:22,890
but you gotta be able to do crowd work.

1778
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:23,161
You've got to,

1779
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:23,994
you know,

1780
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,361
yeah.

1781
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:26,940
I started on Boston and Boston was always,

1782
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,550
no one has a long attention span.

1783
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,850
Everybody wants to do the jokes
quick and if you start bombing,

1784
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,930
you're not going to recover.

1785
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:34,590
Really.

1786
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,880
Nobody recovers in Boston.

1787
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:36,680
It's tough out there.

1788
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,270
And once you start eating
shit they've done with Bobby,

1789
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:41,700
Kelly would tell me stories about
like the rooms he came up to him.

1790
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,660
They are rough rooms.

1791
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:42,901
Yeah.

1792
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,734
We came up together.

1793
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,960
I mean I did a lot of road gigs go.

1794
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:46,201
Yeah,

1795
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:46,421
yeah,

1796
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:46,810
yeah.

1797
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,760
We actually lose that.

1798
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,290
Like what area of boss is that?

1799
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:50,280
Like outside of Boston?

1800
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:50,491
Yeah,

1801
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:52,800
we did a lot of the
Dick Dardy comedy huts.

1802
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:53,290
Okay.

1803
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,660
Out in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1804
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:56,010
Sounds great to Worcester.

1805
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:56,731
Other were great.

1806
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,090
There were [inaudible] which is
like a Polynesian restaurant.

1807
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,670
Yeah.

1808
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,700
And they would have comedy hut.

1809
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:03,241
I went,

1810
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:03,661
I did it.

1811
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:05,790
I did one the 50 minutes Netflix specials.

1812
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:10,680
I went the next day to two days later I
went to a room in Massachusetts outside

1813
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:12,300
of Boston and I bombed so bad.

1814
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,531
It was amazing.

1815
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:13,861
I was like,

1816
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:17,040
well this is why the funniest people
in the world come from this state.

1817
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,053
Where was it?

1818
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,490
Where was I?

1819
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,020
I forget it was a,

1820
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:22,770
um,

1821
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,460
I don't want to say the
actual show who did bucket.

1822
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,110
This guy booked and he knows exactly.

1823
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,130
He would probably tweet me or something.

1824
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:32,590
But it was in God,

1825
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,281
it was outside.

1826
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:34,540
It was like 20 minutes outside.

1827
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,081
It was in,

1828
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:35,690
it was in,

1829
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,410
I'm not Hingham,

1830
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,470
but it was,

1831
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,470
it was somewhere and it was not good.

1832
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,400
It was just a bar.

1833
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:47,230
It was a circular bar and I got up and
then nobody was like w in the middle of

1834
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,370
my set of woman to Trump,

1835
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:52,540
woman started yelling me and then I yell
back at her and then it was okay cause

1836
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,070
we yelled at each other for 20 minutes.

1837
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,250
That was just show.

1838
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,243
What did she yell?

1839
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,950
I think it was something
you have that funny.

1840
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:04,951
If fat fucks up something that was
justified at that moment in the set.

1841
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,310
I went back at her,

1842
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:06,611
I was like,

1843
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:07,031
listen to me,

1844
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:07,864
you fucking animal.

1845
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,740
And then it was great.

1846
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,220
And then they,

1847
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,920
they perked right up and then
the material worked after that.

1848
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,980
It's always exciting when
something like that happens.

1849
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:15,040
It's like finally that was,

1850
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:15,970
it was the Trump moment,

1851
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,460
this moment where people are like sat
up in their chair and they're like,

1852
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:18,851
okay,

1853
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:19,390
we can,

1854
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,110
you know,

1855
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:20,560
um,

1856
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,970
when I was living in Boston,

1857
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,520
you could make a living and not leave.

1858
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,150
Oh Wow.

1859
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,990
You could stay in Boston and
you could go 20 minutes here,

1860
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,090
30 minutes there.

1861
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,080
You go to Andover,

1862
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,240
you go to hang them,

1863
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,400
you go to Framingham who go to all these
different places and you got two gigs

1864
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,920
and I mean you wouldn't get rich,

1865
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:41,590
but you could pay your
bills and never leave town.

1866
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,230
And so there was so much comedy.

1867
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:45,670
There was so many rooms.

1868
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,630
Like Barry Katz had a bunch of rooms
and the common connection had a bunch of

1869
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:53,350
rooms and Mike Clarke had a bunch
of rooms and there were slower.

1870
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,440
That's what really got you really strong.

1871
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:56,921
Yeah.

1872
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:01,600
Because you're mostly doing these hell
gigs during these hell gigs everywhere.

1873
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:02,980
And so when I came to New York,

1874
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,400
what got me was that
everything was like small.

1875
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,930
There were small crowds,

1876
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,370
small stages,

1877
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,990
and you would do a short amount of time.

1878
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:11,441
Yeah.

1879
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:11,920
And I was like,

1880
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,310
Ooh,

1881
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,320
I don't like this that much.

1882
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,940
I could showcase set like 1510 15 minutes.

1883
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:16,060
Yeah.

1884
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,830
Because I was doing like middle sets.

1885
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:19,500
I do a half hour and then I,

1886
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,460
I was headline and I do 45 minutes.

1887
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:21,580
Well,

1888
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,870
so come out to long island.

1889
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:23,440
We have kind of,

1890
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,520
it's an approximation,

1891
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,630
you know,

1892
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,770
of a Boston,

1893
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:27,640
they're wild folks.

1894
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,821
Oh,

1895
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:29,790
I did a lot of gigs in row on long island.

1896
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,873
A lot of gigs along.

1897
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,460
They'll tell you the benefit
of the doubt is nonexistent.

1898
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,061
Yeah.

1899
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:34,811
When I got out there,

1900
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:36,340
east side comedy club was there.

1901
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:36,790
Oh Wow.

1902
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,920
That was back in the day
when Jenny was still around.

1903
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,701
I remember,

1904
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:40,930
I tell this story all the time,

1905
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:42,320
but it's so crazy.

1906
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,650
Like people forgot how God damn good.

1907
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:45,484
Richard Jenny was,

1908
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,840
he was there one night.

1909
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,410
He did four different hours
on Friday and Saturday.

1910
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,880
So he did two shows Friday,

1911
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,271
two show,

1912
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:54,880
Saturday four completely different hours.

1913
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:55,841
And the,

1914
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:56,201
the,

1915
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,130
the opening act and the this,

1916
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,243
uh,

1917
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,610
what the fuck was it?

1918
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,030
How the fuck was the,

1919
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:02,310
uh,

1920
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,580
the MC was a friend of mine,

1921
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,443
Peter.

1922
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,010
God,

1923
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:05,380
it,

1924
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:05,951
Peter Boyle.

1925
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,760
Peep your pill.

1926
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,593
I forget his last name.

1927
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,420
Peter Bales.

1928
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:08,740
Yeah.

1929
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,160
Yeah,

1930
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,450
I know acid is a good dude.

1931
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:10,690
Yeah,

1932
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:11,523
older guy.

1933
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,581
Younger.

1934
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:15,170
Back then this was back in the Disney,

1935
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,770
but he was just like
shaking his head like,

1936
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:18,880
what the fuck man?

1937
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:20,860
The guy did for different hours.

1938
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,340
Yeah.

1939
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:21,881
And I remember,

1940
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:22,031
you know,

1941
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:25,840
I was just barely starting out and
I was sitting back on what the fuck,

1942
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,010
how does a man do for different hours?

1943
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,191
He goes,

1944
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,840
he didn't repeat a premise.

1945
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,550
He did repeat a punchline.

1946
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,241
He did.

1947
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,200
And he crushed.

1948
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,430
And this is one weekend,

1949
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,293
one weekend,

1950
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,811
two shows,

1951
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:36,441
Friday two shows.

1952
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:36,711
Saturday.

1953
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:38,060
He was a genius man.

1954
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:42,620
He was responsible for so many people's
acts two he would tighten up people.

1955
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,850
He worked a lot with rock.

1956
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:44,410
Yeah.

1957
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,320
Work with a lot with
Chris on the road and,

1958
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,390
and worked on.

1959
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,770
Helped them with a specials.

1960
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,633
Was He from Boston,

1961
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,080
Jenny or was he was in New York guy.

1962
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:51,350
Okay.

1963
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:51,680
Yeah.

1964
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,030
I think he was from Brooklyn.

1965
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,280
He was fucking amazing man.

1966
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,680
But that was the east side
comedy club back in the day.

1967
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,130
Yeah.

1968
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,700
Yeah.

1969
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:58,911
No,

1970
00:50:58,911 --> 00:50:59,211
it's good.

1971
00:50:59,211 --> 00:50:59,631
Those rooms,

1972
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:00,530
like governors of brokerage.

1973
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:01,720
I liked those rooms because you,

1974
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:03,530
you go out there and if you're funny,

1975
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:03,921
you're funny,

1976
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:04,754
you'll kill.

1977
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:05,241
And if you're,

1978
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:09,410
if you're like lacking or I feel
like a bit half done to let you know,

1979
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,250
they'll let you know.

1980
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:10,790
Yeah.

1981
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,710
They paid the money to let you know.

1982
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:13,790
Ah,

1983
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:14,660
you'll hear it audibly,

1984
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,071
but that's good.

1985
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:16,904
You need that.

1986
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,920
Like Holly Quinn builds,

1987
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:18,850
he shows there and it,

1988
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,420
they're amazing because,

1989
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:20,870
and there,

1990
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:21,081
you know,

1991
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:21,591
his new shows,

1992
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:22,101
great red state,

1993
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:22,461
blue state.

1994
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:23,660
But like did he filled it out there?

1995
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,870
I don't know if he did this one be built
a lot of his shows out there because

1996
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:29,510
like he goes out there
and he says if it's good,

1997
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:30,500
they're really going to let you know.

1998
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,750
So it's where a lot of
comics will go and test.

1999
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,160
Similar to the reloads rooms in Boston,

2000
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,450
you really test,

2001
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,860
you get coddled a little bit.

2002
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:37,461
In New York City.

2003
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,220
In La you get cuddles.

2004
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,900
Who'd got to go out there to
somebody who doesn't give a shit?

2005
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:42,560
That's,

2006
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:42,861
you know,

2007
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:43,581
the people who were like,

2008
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:44,360
listen,

2009
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,630
I'm either those people out
there don't choose to laugh.

2010
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,003
They laugh or they don't.

2011
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:49,600
Right.

2012
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,480
You got to echo park.

2013
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:51,314
They choose.

2014
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,800
Yeah.

2015
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,670
They sit there and they go,

2016
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:53,980
ah.

2017
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,400
Or they'll go like this and go,

2018
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:56,323
no,

2019
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,470
look in their face you'll see it.

2020
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:57,920
They'll be like,

2021
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,753
no.

2022
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,500
Out in those areas like [inaudible].

2023
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,880
It's an instinctual,

2024
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,620
guttural laugh.

2025
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,071
Yeah,

2026
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:04,904
it's not,

2027
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:05,940
it's,

2028
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,320
it's,

2029
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,730
it's not the,

2030
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,030
yeah.

2031
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:12,550
The thing about like laughter
when you're choosing to laugh,

2032
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,820
he in here and there,

2033
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:16,460
it's so pretentious.

2034
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,383
It's not fun.

2035
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,020
Yeah.

2036
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,660
It goes back to that example
of like growing up you,

2037
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,740
you're making people laugh.

2038
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,570
Who the hell's choosing to laugh?

2039
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,750
What psychopath is sitting there going?

2040
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,590
Ah.

2041
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,960
Also they're mostly in the business.

2042
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,660
Like a lot of the
audiences in the business,

2043
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:37,010
the whole thing is to this weird entire
thing is agents who are like 22 years

2044
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:37,340
old.

2045
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,060
Yep.

2046
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,620
They're like embryos to so young.

2047
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:42,890
The agents and agents and
managers for the most part,

2048
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,040
excluding mine who I love
by agents and managers,

2049
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,730
they're rich kids who
can't do tech or finance.

2050
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,560
Let's be a lot of them.

2051
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:52,850
There's quite a few,

2052
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,421
let's be honest,

2053
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,790
he's a rich kid whose parents go,

2054
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,713
hey,

2055
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,000
can you do something because I don't want
to look at you anymore and they're not

2056
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:03,350
going to get a job at jolly bee.

2057
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,070
Right?

2058
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,700
So they're going to go get a desk
at UTA or CAA or WME and most,

2059
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:08,331
I mean,

2060
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:09,680
everyone needs one too.

2061
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:10,670
That's the other big thing.

2062
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:12,230
Like you're not going to
negotiate on your own.

2063
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,370
You're going to do a terrible job.

2064
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,830
If you negotiate your own gigs.

2065
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,290
I will take any amount
of money to do anything.

2066
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:19,580
I mean,

2067
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,361
I mean,

2068
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:21,930
I'm horrible at negotiating.

2069
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,600
I was bad in sales,

2070
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:24,560
sales didn't work.

2071
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:25,290
And now I'm here.

2072
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:25,531
You know,

2073
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:25,980
apparently

2074
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,500
Bill Murray doesn't have
an agent or a manager.

2075
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:33,510
He has an answering machine and people
call them up and they make them offers to

2076
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:36,390
do things and he'll like listen
to those messages and go,

2077
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,990
hmm,

2078
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:37,823
I'll do that one.

2079
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,210
And he just goes and does it.

2080
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,391
Well,

2081
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,070
if you're like a legend like that,

2082
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:41,610
yeah,

2083
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,190
I guess you can do that and
you can do whatever he wants.

2084
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,090
What an interesting says.

2085
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,271
No,

2086
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:46,740
I need an agent like blackmail,

2087
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,603
paypal,

2088
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,840
CIA level,

2089
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:50,790
blackmail to get me into rooms.

2090
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:51,921
Well the thing is,

2091
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:53,250
it's not just that,

2092
00:53:53,251 --> 00:53:57,990
like you need someone to actually do
the talking for you to like get gigs.

2093
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:58,440
Oh yeah.

2094
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,071
Or you know,

2095
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:02,580
to negotiate your money
or to do your air travel.

2096
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:03,780
It's not call me and she'll be like,

2097
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:05,940
they wanted 85 shows over the weekend.

2098
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,810
I got a dentist,

2099
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,643
you know,

2100
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,360
cause I'm looking at newer
comics so if they want nine,

2101
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:09,900
seven shows,

2102
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,733
I do it.

2103
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,490
Y'All do it.

2104
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,380
Do you get when you
five shows on Saturday,

2105
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,750
I'll do it two or three
shows on Saturday night.

2106
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:16,250
Yeah.

2107
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,150
Three at the same clubs sometimes.

2108
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:18,600
Yeah.

2109
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,291
Those are weird.

2110
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:19,951
That third show,

2111
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:21,310
you don't know what the
fuck you already shows.

2112
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,500
Not even comedy anymore.

2113
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,540
I don't know what is happening.

2114
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,000
I don't know what's
happening at that point.

2115
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,170
But um,

2116
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,130
it can be really foot.

2117
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:30,840
The third show a lot of times is people,

2118
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:33,480
the audience is people who have
been asked to leave other venues,

2119
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,260
so their trunk and walking by the
club Nigga and that you're just,

2120
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,580
their friend brings him in.

2121
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,541
This is literally,

2122
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:40,374
I've heard,

2123
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,520
I've literally spoke to somebody,

2124
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:41,761
I'm like,

2125
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:42,391
why are they here?

2126
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:43,160
And they were gone.

2127
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,050
Well we were asked to leave and they
saw it and they just saw the lights and

2128
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:46,884
they like lights.

2129
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,580
So we brought them in and
now you're talking about,

2130
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,360
you know,

2131
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,910
frozen yogurt or whatever and they're,

2132
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:53,571
you know,

2133
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:54,320
if it's nuts,

2134
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,620
what's the show's crazy.

2135
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,170
What's the latest set you can
get in New York City these days?

2136
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,411
Oh,

2137
00:54:58,411 --> 00:54:58,880
you can get like,

2138
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,330
I think it's like a two 45 or something.

2139
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,240
You can get something crazy.

2140
00:55:01,241 --> 00:55:05,010
45 maybe it's two 30 maybe it's till
you can get something really late.

2141
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,940
Wow.

2142
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,200
People are up.

2143
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,600
Who the fuck is there
to 45 there's people.

2144
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,080
Really?

2145
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,440
Yeah.

2146
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,273
What's it like?

2147
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:11,820
It ain't,

2148
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,570
I mean I think it,

2149
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,970
I think it's pretty good
depending on the night,

2150
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,160
like a Saturday night to 45 probably.

2151
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:17,970
Great.

2152
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,950
Why don't you listen or it gets,

2153
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:20,161
yeah,

2154
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:21,210
I think the seller is the latest.

2155
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:22,044
I think you can get,

2156
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,550
but as it gets louder,

2157
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,450
I mean as it gets later,

2158
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:25,284
people get drunker.

2159
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,710
I used to do danger
fields that's in there.

2160
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,190
Yeah.

2161
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,870
And we do prom shows.

2162
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:31,410
Yeah.

2163
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,790
Do you ever do the prom show thing?

2164
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,110
I'm not a prompt show act.

2165
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:37,140
This is what they do with a bunch of
kids are sitting there and I walk out on

2166
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:37,560
stage.

2167
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,580
It's a bad prom.

2168
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,971
Well,

2169
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:40,140
it's always a bad prom.

2170
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,550
Prom shows a terrible,

2171
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,350
but what they do is they,

2172
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:44,223
they don't,

2173
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,870
and back in the day at least,

2174
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,720
they didn't change the crowd.

2175
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,093
So you would,

2176
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,210
you would go out,

2177
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:53,440
like say if there's like
four comics on the light up,

2178
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,250
there's an MC and three other comics
and then there's the next show,

2179
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,090
it starts all over again.

2180
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,530
We see the same three comics,

2181
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,000
the audiences there.

2182
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:04,650
So they want you to do the exact same
acts so that the kids will leave because

2183
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:05,850
they have no account of the kids.

2184
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,300
So that buses pulled up and they're
just stuffing these kids in there and

2185
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:11,100
they're hoping that if
you do the same bits,

2186
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,390
the kids will get bored.

2187
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,070
And they got mad at me cause I'm like,

2188
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:14,370
look,

2189
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,410
I'm not doing the same material.

2190
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:17,640
I see the same faces.

2191
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,230
It's boring.

2192
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:18,330
Yeah.

2193
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,770
I'm only doing a 15 minutes set.

2194
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:20,041
I go,

2195
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,180
I have more material,

2196
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,050
I'm going to do other,

2197
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,943
other bits.

2198
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,351
And they're like,

2199
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:24,460
you got to do the same jokes.

2200
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:25,600
We're trying to get
these people out of here.

2201
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,021
I'm like,

2202
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:26,854
how about just the cast?

2203
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,783
Just grab him.

2204
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,140
Just get him Outta here.

2205
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:29,291
Yeah,

2206
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:30,490
just light a fire.

2207
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,390
But we would do them til
five o'clock in the morning.

2208
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,830
Dangerfield,

2209
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,830
the last time was in danger fields.

2210
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:36,850
It was four people in a room,

2211
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,533
two couples,

2212
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,240
waiters about in his mid eighties.

2213
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,050
I,

2214
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,210
it's dark and I'm performing
in front of a piano.

2215
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,890
It's one of those nights where you go,

2216
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,353
you know,

2217
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,120
this was a choice I made
to get into this business.

2218
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:50,423
Um,

2219
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,410
but there's something haunting about
that room and it was actually fun.

2220
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,390
I'm just entertaining to couples.

2221
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:56,020
Yeah,

2222
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,853
it's crazy.

2223
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,190
I did one cup of once at the end.

2224
00:56:58,191 --> 00:56:58,900
Your fields,

2225
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,650
there was no one,

2226
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,483
there was no show.

2227
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,820
I had a nine o'clock spot,

2228
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,560
isn't it?

2229
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,280
There's never a show.

2230
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,270
I had a nine o'clock spot.

2231
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,080
Yeah,

2232
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,220
I got there at eight 45.

2233
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,810
The comics are sitting around the bar.

2234
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,321
I go,

2235
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:08,890
what's going on?

2236
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:09,101
They're like,

2237
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:09,934
there's no one here.

2238
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,121
I go,

2239
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:10,954
there's no one here.

2240
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,310
And then right when I said that,

2241
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,940
this couple walked up and Bobby,

2242
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:15,521
who was the,

2243
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:15,611
uh,

2244
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:16,240
the doorman,

2245
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,090
there's this fucking
Scottish power lifter guy.

2246
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,180
He was like five foot 10
and five foot 10 wide.

2247
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:22,760
Oh,

2248
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,593
interesting.

2249
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:27,820
I saw him grab a kid by his neck at one
of these prompts shows and pick him up

2250
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:30,230
by his neck and carry
them out of their cheese.

2251
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:30,701
Anyway,

2252
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:31,960
he was this tank of a man.

2253
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:34,870
He was always fucking hilarious
and ruthless on the comedians.

2254
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:35,190
Yeah,

2255
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:35,500
yeah.

2256
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,010
You got to try that bag of Shite.

2257
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:38,080
You call it a fucking act.

2258
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:38,770
And,

2259
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:39,603
and anyway,

2260
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,170
these people walk in and he's like,

2261
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:41,791
ladies,

2262
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,100
gentlemen,

2263
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,060
welcome to danger fields.

2264
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:43,894
Come on right in.

2265
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,890
And he brings him in and these people
walked into his empty room and sit down

2266
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:48,611
and they're like,

2267
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,590
what the fuck is going on?

2268
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,320
Like it crazy.

2269
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,970
And then all of a sudden the lights come
on and then the MC comes out and they

2270
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,680
sat through all of us.

2271
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,160
Wow.

2272
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:57,551
Sat through.

2273
00:57:57,551 --> 00:57:58,060
I was like,

2274
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,690
you know,

2275
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,530
fourth on the lineup
or something like that.

2276
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,290
I did my fucking 15 minutes in front of
these two people and they were into it.

2277
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,070
They were great.

2278
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:06,460
Yeah,

2279
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:06,881
they were great,

2280
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:07,541
but it was weird.

2281
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:07,751
You know,

2282
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:08,460
it's the,

2283
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,790
those shows what's good
about those shows build you?

2284
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,081
Well,

2285
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:11,470
they may,

2286
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,280
they let you know what's bullshit and
your act because you feel embarrassed

2287
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:14,740
saying it.

2288
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,700
That's a great point.

2289
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:15,971
Yeah.

2290
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:18,130
You feel it feels clunky
coming out of your mouth,

2291
00:58:18,131 --> 00:58:18,431
right.

2292
00:58:18,431 --> 00:58:19,660
Especially to three people.

2293
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,020
Well,

2294
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,710
there's always,

2295
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,120
things are always clunky,

2296
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:22,680
right?

2297
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,440
Like,

2298
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,180
and when it's a small crowd,

2299
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:26,470
they're really clunky.

2300
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,880
Like when you're working on material,

2301
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:29,590
every time I have a premise,

2302
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:31,630
or even if I'm fucking telling a story,

2303
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,471
a lot of times,

2304
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:34,120
like as I'm starting to tell the story,

2305
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:37,930
like the beginning part is a little
fucking clunky and maybe I'm saying

2306
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,510
something the wrong way and
it doesn't make total sense.

2307
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,860
And then eventually it catches on.

2308
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,140
If you do that in front of two people,

2309
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,001
they're like,

2310
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:47,170
what are you doing?

2311
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,800
Yeah.

2312
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,740
The best story about the age of fields
was there was a guy who walked in once I

2313
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:52,210
was hitting in the bar area,

2314
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,590
he had a Rodney Dangerfield,

2315
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,730
a doll,

2316
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:55,841
and he walked in.

2317
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:56,081
He goes,

2318
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:56,860
listen,

2319
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,060
I've had a business for t,

2320
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,450
you know,

2321
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,340
for 10 years up the block I,

2322
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,570
we found the stall.

2323
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,530
I'm moving to,

2324
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:02,740
you know,

2325
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,490
wherever he was going.

2326
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:03,910
He's like,

2327
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:04,900
we're closing up shop.

2328
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,393
Here you go.

2329
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,360
I thought you might like it.

2330
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,070
And then the guy took it,

2331
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,120
he said to the owner,

2332
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,350
he said he just,

2333
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:12,640
there was no speaking right.

2334
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,700
He just showed him this doll and then
the owner just pointed and then the guy

2335
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:19,300
carried this Rodney Dangerfield doll
down the stairs and just put it in like

2336
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,134
storage.

2337
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,240
And it was the darkest moment,

2338
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,780
which is such a dark
moment to sit there silent.

2339
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,970
Just the owner went and pointed in.

2340
00:59:28,971 --> 00:59:32,050
The guy just took this Dangerfield
doll and he walked it down into caught,

2341
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,140
only know the phantom of the opera,

2342
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,240
whatever the hell goes
down under that club.

2343
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:35,751
But yeah,

2344
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:36,231
that's a real,

2345
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:37,490
that's like the oldest
club in the country.

2346
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,720
How's it still open?

2347
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:38,991
I,

2348
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:43,340
that is a great question that the
FBI would probably want to look into.

2349
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,473
I don't know

2350
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,390
cause everybody's getting the same story.

2351
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,230
People who was there,

2352
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,090
people go 25 years ago,

2353
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,290
25 years ago.

2354
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:52,270
There was no one there.

2355
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,490
I mean the fucking show
that I'm telling you about,

2356
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:55,960
that was 25 years ago.

2357
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,160
There's never been anyone there.

2358
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,313
I don't know.

2359
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,970
Money off those prompts shows though.

2360
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:01,660
They were packed.

2361
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,050
It's like a great joke about like
Nanette that my buddy nick Mullane is an

2362
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:06,220
amazingly funny comedian,

2363
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:07,120
said he's like in the net.

2364
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:07,691
No one's seen,

2365
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,450
it's just a trailer like
no one seemed to net.

2366
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,980
It's just a trailer and everyone's like,

2367
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:12,800
it's brave.

2368
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,840
It's really amazing.

2369
01:00:13,841 --> 01:00:14,860
It's my number one.

2370
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,641
It's just a trailer.

2371
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:16,540
It literally doesn't exist,

2372
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,021
so maybe,

2373
01:00:17,021 --> 01:00:17,471
I don't know,

2374
01:00:17,471 --> 01:00:18,040
but it is.

2375
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,840
It's one of those rooms in New
York that's kind of haunting.

2376
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:20,591
Yeah,

2377
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:21,610
it's a strange place.

2378
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:21,851
It did.

2379
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,560
You ever listen to the
day the laughter died?

2380
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:24,880
No.

2381
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,470
Dice Clay's a double album that
he filmed there with no audience.

2382
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:31,060
No one knew he was coming.

2383
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,890
He had no material.

2384
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:33,970
Zero.

2385
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:34,511
That's amazing.

2386
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:39,160
He just started talking about shit and
ad libbing things and he was as big as a

2387
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:42,970
fucking comedian could be at the time
and he called it the day the laughter

2388
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:43,300
died.

2389
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:43,570
Right.

2390
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:44,590
Ruben produced it.

2391
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:45,431
That's no,

2392
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:46,031
I've heard of it,

2393
01:00:46,031 --> 01:00:50,050
but I didn't know it was fucking
brilliant and horrible at the same time.

2394
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:50,411
Really.

2395
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:51,910
Some guy gets up in the middle of his set,

2396
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:52,091
he goes,

2397
01:00:52,091 --> 01:00:54,070
you're about as funny
as our gloss or milk.

2398
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,300
Oh my God.

2399
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,150
What a polite apple.

2400
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,170
What an old fashioned heckle.

2401
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,160
I've never heard that.

2402
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:01,750
Usually people are like,

2403
01:01:01,751 --> 01:01:02,840
shut up faggot.

2404
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,601
You're a baptist.

2405
01:01:04,601 --> 01:01:05,720
Funny as a glass of milk.

2406
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:06,281
It's lovely.

2407
01:01:06,281 --> 01:01:06,491
Yeah.

2408
01:01:06,491 --> 01:01:08,680
Some guy from Connecticut
or something like that,

2409
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:09,370
you know?

2410
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,270
Then he got mad.

2411
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:12,260
He got mad at dice and you know,

2412
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,830
it's just shitting on him
and shit on everything.

2413
01:01:14,831 --> 01:01:16,250
That's probably just destroyed it.

2414
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,280
Well was it was destroying them,

2415
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:19,061
but I'm telling you,

2416
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:20,500
he wasn't even trying.

2417
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:21,760
It was,

2418
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,760
it was like he was at some crazy place
in his career where he just decided to do

2419
01:01:28,391 --> 01:01:29,860
a set or he's bombing.

2420
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,240
Do you ever think of
doing something like that?

2421
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:31,860
Crazy.

2422
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,500
Never think it just called crazy into it.

2423
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,390
Something completely.

2424
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,790
I'm just trying to do,

2425
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:37,893
first of all,

2426
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,450
I would feel bad.

2427
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,780
I can't do something bad on
purpose because then people,

2428
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:44,920
if I do something bad,

2429
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,000
like if you,

2430
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:46,901
ladies and gentlemen,

2431
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:48,160
if you hear it and it sucks,

2432
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,323
I fucked up.

2433
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,140
That's it.

2434
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:50,501
I've made it.

2435
01:01:50,501 --> 01:01:51,131
I made a mistake.

2436
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:51,960
I didn't do it good.

2437
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,270
Right.

2438
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:52,751
I didn't,

2439
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:53,110
uh,

2440
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:53,861
didn't put it together.

2441
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:54,161
Right.

2442
01:01:54,161 --> 01:01:54,260
A,

2443
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,240
it's trial and error.

2444
01:01:55,241 --> 01:01:56,200
Sometimes it's an error.

2445
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,000
I'm not going to do
anything bad on purpose,

2446
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:02,410
but he was so big and no one
had been that big before.

2447
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:02,611
Right.

2448
01:02:02,611 --> 01:02:04,390
Have to realize no one had
done arenas before him.

2449
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:04,601
Right.

2450
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:06,040
He was the first arena caught first.

2451
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:06,190
Yeah,

2452
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:06,761
the first.

2453
01:02:06,761 --> 01:02:07,120
Yeah.

2454
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,610
And a fucking hundred of them.

2455
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,640
He would do them all over the country
and he just had had enough for whatever

2456
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:17,580
reason of fucking everybody loving him.

2457
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,030
Yeah.

2458
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:18,461
And he's like,

2459
01:02:18,461 --> 01:02:21,990
fuck you just went out and
just said fucking double CD.

2460
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,540
It's grey wt Broadway show,

2461
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,460
like a live album recording
of a Broadway show.

2462
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,770
Hours of no material.

2463
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,030
Just rambling,

2464
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,410
talking about stuff,

2465
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,060
punch lines that don't make sense.

2466
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,470
He's just out there,

2467
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:36,630
do whatever you want can great.

2468
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,171
To this day,

2469
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,150
it's one of my favorite
comedy albums of all time.

2470
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,940
I'll listen to it every now and
then for like 15 minutes in my car,

2471
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:42,301
I just go,

2472
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,520
what the fat to me.

2473
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,940
Is it all at Dangerfield?

2474
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:45,270
Yes.

2475
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,840
All of that.

2476
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,630
All that danger fields.

2477
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,730
No one knew he was coming.

2478
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:48,420
Yeah.

2479
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,021
And when they saw him,

2480
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:49,231
they're like,

2481
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:49,951
holy shit,

2482
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:50,760
it's dice clay.

2483
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,130
It was probably 20 people in
the crowd who were so excited.

2484
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,020
They probably did it on
a Tuesday or some shit.

2485
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,273
He's an animal.

2486
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,220
That's amazing though.

2487
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:57,800
Yeah,

2488
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,270
that's amazing.

2489
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:58,651
That to me,

2490
01:02:58,651 --> 01:02:59,311
that type of stuff.

2491
01:02:59,311 --> 01:02:59,790
I like,

2492
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,560
I liked that to have to stop
because to me it's like,

2493
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:04,080
it's the raw essence of what this is.

2494
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:06,120
I found out about it
from another comedian,

2495
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:06,211
they,

2496
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:07,011
Mike Donovan,

2497
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:08,490
a hilarious guy from Boston,

2498
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,410
and he was crying,

2499
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,010
laughing,

2500
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:16,010
describing it and describing this bit
the dice was doing about Nixon eating ass

2501
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,213
fucking,

2502
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,711
and he was doing,

2503
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:23,640
this is crazy,

2504
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:24,120
whatever.

2505
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,230
It was so ridiculous.

2506
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:26,011
But for whatever reason,

2507
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:26,850
Mike Donovan was,

2508
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:29,160
tears were coming out of
it so he couldn't breathe.

2509
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,390
He was describing it.

2510
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:30,901
I was like,

2511
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:31,201
God,

2512
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:31,861
I gotta listen to this.

2513
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:33,150
Fucking nice is one of those guys,

2514
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:33,691
when you watch them,

2515
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:34,170
you're like,

2516
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,580
this guy can just talk.

2517
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,090
Yeah.

2518
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:36,923
And it's funny.

2519
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:37,681
Well,

2520
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:38,760
he's going to interesting.

2521
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:42,060
He's been around for so long and you know,

2522
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,640
to me he's always represented to me,

2523
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:48,900
my childhood because when I was like
19 was the first time I listened to his

2524
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,950
cassette in my car with
my girlfriend and I could,

2525
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,430
we were just crying,

2526
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:53,850
laughing.

2527
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,080
I couldn't believe how funny was.

2528
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,280
Is that what made you with these?

2529
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:57,270
He one of the guys what you will like?

2530
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:58,650
I want to start doing stand up.

2531
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,011
Yeah,

2532
01:03:59,011 --> 01:03:59,611
for sure.

2533
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:00,780
He was definitely one of them.

2534
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:03,390
Him and Kinison him and kittens and prior,

2535
01:04:03,391 --> 01:04:07,740
but prior was see like I remember watching
those guys and then watching prior

2536
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:08,160
and we're like,

2537
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,590
God prior was so smooth.

2538
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:14,010
He was so the way he was so
personable and vulnerable.

2539
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:16,680
He was something different
because he was vulnerable.

2540
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:21,120
He would talk about like his life and
his problems and all these different

2541
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:24,210
things about being addicted to drugs
and all these different Indian,

2542
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,760
it was so intelligent,

2543
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:29,670
but vulnerable and honest and,

2544
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,040
and the timing was so good.

2545
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,240
He was such a master.

2546
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,450
I remember we were watching was
me and my roommates at the time.

2547
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,470
We watched the Kinison special and then
we watched Richard Pryor and my friend

2548
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:44,310
who was never a comedian and everyone
thought he goes dot fucking guys the best

2549
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,540
cause he's just the best.

2550
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:46,500
And it was just,

2551
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,850
we were both in agreement like,

2552
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:48,001
yeah,

2553
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:48,834
he's just better.

2554
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,330
It's just the way he did it,

2555
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:52,231
you know.

2556
01:04:52,231 --> 01:04:52,801
And this is,

2557
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:53,634
you know,

2558
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,830
we're talking like 1988 sure.

2559
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:00,890
So it was still fairly fresh and
prior was still alive and it was just

2560
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:01,800
different,

2561
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,131
you know,

2562
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:02,611
he was,

2563
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:03,390
uh,

2564
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,680
he was like the first,

2565
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:10,130
I mean obviously Lenny Bruce was the
first really honest comedian like,

2566
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:14,150
or one of the first honest social
commentators and then Carlin,

2567
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:18,570
but prior took it to a weird
personal place where you like,

2568
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,200
we're rooting for him.

2569
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:24,100
It was the most personal of all of those
guys because the Hex and Collin were

2570
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:25,510
famously like not personal.

2571
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,080
Yes.

2572
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,160
And prior was personal.

2573
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:27,940
Yes.

2574
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,773
Yes.

2575
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,613
Personal and,

2576
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:30,820
and you know,

2577
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:31,481
he,

2578
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:33,970
he would like emphasize humanity.

2579
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:34,420
Yeah.

2580
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:38,620
Like you would emphasize like loving
each other and being kind to each other.

2581
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,431
Like that was a thing.

2582
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:39,790
Yeah,

2583
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:40,570
absolutely.

2584
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,230
Yeah,

2585
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,063
absolutely.

2586
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:42,371
But,

2587
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:42,790
uh,

2588
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:43,331
you know,

2589
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:46,420
I tell my parents took me to see live
at the sunset strip and I was a little

2590
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:46,840
kid.

2591
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:46,991
Oh,

2592
01:05:46,991 --> 01:05:47,591
you saw it,

2593
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:48,401
the actual none.

2594
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:51,150
And all of a sudden in the movie
theater when a movie theater and that,

2595
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:53,350
that was probably the big seed.

2596
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,131
That was the impact.

2597
01:05:54,131 --> 01:05:54,190
Yeah.

2598
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:54,490
Yeah.

2599
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,040
Because I couldn't believe how
funny this guy was just talking.

2600
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,400
I remember looking around the theater
and these people were like falling out of

2601
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:01,720
their chairs laughing and I'm like,

2602
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,090
I can't believe this guy is just talking.

2603
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:04,930
And it's amazing.

2604
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:05,021
Yeah.

2605
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:07,450
Because all these movies that
I'd seen that were really funny.

2606
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:07,641
Yeah.

2607
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:11,130
He was a bunch of things happen
and explosions and fucking stripes.

2608
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:11,830
Yeah.

2609
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:13,150
But this was not that.

2610
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:13,421
Yeah.

2611
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:13,931
I saw,

2612
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:17,440
I sat Eddie Pepitone tape his
special a few days ago at a dynasty,

2613
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:21,220
a typewriter and he's one of those guys
who still funny and so electric that you

2614
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:22,270
have a room full of,

2615
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,170
you know,

2616
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,320
the type of people were kind of
talking about your more buttoned up,

2617
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:27,300
you know,

2618
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,110
the more of that kind
of alternative crowd.

2619
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,540
They were barking and howling.

2620
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,660
And how funny he was and
some of the things he said.

2621
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:35,620
The first thing he does,

2622
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,300
he grabbed the microphone and he's like,

2623
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,620
I'm on Molly.

2624
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:46,250
The hall just exploded and he's one
of those dudes I watch and I'm like,

2625
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:47,643
man,

2626
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,540
intensity.

2627
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:49,480
Just raw power.

2628
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,730
He's announced such a nice guy too.

2629
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:52,600
He's a great too,

2630
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,500
if you know him.

2631
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,010
Yeah.

2632
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:54,910
Route Forum.

2633
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:59,950
A sweetheart of a car and an odd guy like,

2634
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:01,750
I don't know any other Eddie Pepitone.

2635
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:01,991
No.

2636
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:03,280
That's what makes him so great.

2637
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:03,590
Yeah.

2638
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:03,761
He's,

2639
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:04,241
he's like,

2640
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:05,800
this is an experience and the beat,

2641
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,161
to me,

2642
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:06,851
the best comedy,

2643
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:08,140
I think is a comedy where you go,

2644
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:08,771
Oh,

2645
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:10,600
I'm having an experience
now I can't have again.

2646
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:11,051
Right,

2647
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:11,201
right,

2648
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:11,470
right.

2649
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,600
I can't have this again
or especially a live show.

2650
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:13,930
Yeah.

2651
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,610
I can't go down the block and see this.

2652
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,530
It's not as a steak house.

2653
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:18,700
It's the same in every city.

2654
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:24,540
This is a fucking unique human individual
that's having this experience at this

2655
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:25,510
moment,

2656
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,590
and I'm lucky to be here with,

2657
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,173
yeah.

2658
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:28,550
Yeah.

2659
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,530
Live shows,

2660
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:30,220
man.

2661
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,280
There's something about it that
it's so hard to translate when you,

2662
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:34,360
when you did your Netflix,

2663
01:07:34,361 --> 01:07:35,860
but if you did one of the 15 minute ones,

2664
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,510
how many they're doing a lot of those,

2665
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,830
which I think is a good move.

2666
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:40,240
Four to 5,000 jobs.

2667
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,103
It's a great movie.

2668
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:44,920
It's a great move to have
everyone have a special,

2669
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:46,180
I think my mother's doing one.

2670
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:47,290
It's very exciting.

2671
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:47,800
Uh,

2672
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,590
you don't even have to do comedy
and have a special anymore.

2673
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,520
You can just sit in a car and talk.

2674
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:53,890
That's my next admission tape
will be me speaking in a,

2675
01:07:53,891 --> 01:07:55,450
in a car going through an in and out,

2676
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,110
um,

2677
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:00,580
bill burrs videos of him driving around
his fucking 40 funnier than just talking

2678
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:00,711
about,

2679
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:01,620
this is the funniest thing.

2680
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,800
Most specials.

2681
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:03,820
Um,

2682
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:04,991
the Netflix,

2683
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,860
he was a lot of fun,

2684
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,300
but here's the reality.

2685
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,920
I watch it back and I'm like,

2686
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,451
it was fun.

2687
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:10,284
Or in the room,

2688
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:11,290
you know,

2689
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,370
it's just one of those things,

2690
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:12,701
I bet.

2691
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:14,770
Bring the pain was better in the
room even though it's amazing.

2692
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,140
Right,

2693
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:15,261
right.

2694
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:15,980
You watch that and you're

2695
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,101
like,

2696
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:17,930
this is the highest heights of anything.

2697
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,231
Yeah.

2698
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:21,800
That's why when someone makes you
laugh really hard on a special God,

2699
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:23,420
imagine what it'd been like being there.

2700
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:23,871
Oh yeah.

2701
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:24,390
I mean the,

2702
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:29,270
the comedy is an act I have one of my
friends always says comedy should be seen

2703
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,800
live in,

2704
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:31,580
and listen,

2705
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,740
there's something different
about a smaller venue,

2706
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,600
like when people go see what the store,

2707
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,430
there's something different
than seeing you in a theater.

2708
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,050
The level of intimacy,

2709
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:39,681
you know,

2710
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,090
seen you work stuff out,

2711
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:41,990
seeing you in,

2712
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:42,920
you know,

2713
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,753
in the moment.

2714
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,070
There's something
different about that 100%.

2715
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:46,700
Yeah.

2716
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:47,120
Yeah.

2717
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,090
I like 150 to 300 seat room.

2718
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:50,870
That's what I like.

2719
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:51,400
But I also,

2720
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,240
I like 11,000 seats too.

2721
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:54,110
It's kind of crazy.

2722
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:55,190
It's fun in a weird way.

2723
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,001
That's amazing.

2724
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:59,060
And if you could make those people
like feel like it's intimate,

2725
01:08:59,090 --> 01:08:59,400
it's uh,

2726
01:08:59,400 --> 01:08:59,721
it's like,

2727
01:08:59,721 --> 01:08:59,990
uh,

2728
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,823
you can,

2729
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,010
you can treat 11,000 people the
same way you treat the main room.

2730
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,250
A hundred seat room that's
filled with about 80 people.

2731
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,113
That's good too.

2732
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,760
This is low expectations.

2733
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:10,281
What I like.

2734
01:09:10,281 --> 01:09:14,210
I like a big room full of the very small
amount of people and they could sit

2735
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:16,790
back and get really
drunk and that were lax.

2736
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:20,090
All the wait staff home
shut off most of the lights.

2737
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:20,721
Yeah.

2738
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:21,554
There's something,

2739
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:25,430
there's something going on when you're
doing a live performance that no one's

2740
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:26,660
ever really quantified.

2741
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:31,430
It's some kind of a mass hypnosis or some
energy transfer because I was an actor

2742
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:32,211
for when I was a kid.

2743
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:34,040
I was six years old to 12.

2744
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:34,874
I was an actor.

2745
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,500
You know your parents' idea.

2746
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,520
Oh it was my idea,

2747
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:38,570
Joe and uh,

2748
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,160
like most six year olds or six.

2749
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:40,371
Yeah,

2750
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:41,000
it was great.

2751
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,300
I was,

2752
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,070
I knew what your cabaret license,

2753
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,960
it was on sesame street twice.

2754
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,863
We really,

2755
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,110
for it to all legit.

2756
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:48,200
Was It really your idea?

2757
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:48,830
Yeah.

2758
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,270
I pointed at the TV and said,

2759
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:50,481
well,

2760
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:54,170
unless my parents are lying cause I
don't remember and they are liars.

2761
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:58,010
So they needed muddy all south.

2762
01:09:59,240 --> 01:09:59,751
They said,

2763
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,910
I pointed to the TV and
said I want to be on that.

2764
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:02,541
And I just,

2765
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:02,811
and I,

2766
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:06,200
and I made them take me on auditions
that maybe they were looking over their

2767
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:09,500
bills and I was a good looking little
kid and they said he needs to start

2768
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:12,470
pulling his weight and you know,

2769
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,333
we've got to start taking him up.

2770
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:13,490
Yeah,

2771
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,450
it was on sesame street.

2772
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,860
I was in a bunch of plays and stuff.

2773
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:17,630
That live performance is different.

2774
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:18,470
It's still energy,

2775
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:24,070
but there's nothing quite like
being alone on a stage doing comedy.

2776
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,030
Well there's all doodle much later.

2777
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,920
It's all your shit.

2778
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,150
You're writing it,

2779
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,310
you're figuring out your per se it,

2780
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,030
yeah,

2781
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,230
you're crafting it,

2782
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,220
putting it together.

2783
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,950
And that's why the
rejection is the deepest.

2784
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:37,963
How do you write?

2785
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:43,120
I go on stage with an idea and I've
started doing these little videos on

2786
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:46,520
Instagram where I actually kind of rant
about an issue and if people kind of

2787
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:47,690
respond positively to them,

2788
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:51,440
sometimes I'll take that to the stage
and I'll just try to rant about an issue

2789
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:56,060
and like find a few lines that are
keepers that are funny and that's,

2790
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:59,240
and then I'll sit down and rewrite
it and we look at the bit and re,

2791
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,890
but a lot of what I do has to be like,

2792
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:01,910
how does it sound?

2793
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:02,130
What's,

2794
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,410
what's the inflection was to pay.

2795
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:05,750
Saying so like being onstage helps a lot.

2796
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,811
But there are things that I,

2797
01:11:06,811 --> 01:11:10,490
and what's hard for me and what I have
to get better about is writing about

2798
01:11:10,491 --> 01:11:12,450
things I don't care about somehow.

2799
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:13,770
So like if

2800
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,701
like if you said,

2801
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:16,830
give me 50 jokes about the Kardashians,

2802
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:17,111
I,

2803
01:11:17,111 --> 01:11:18,330
I would not want to do that.

2804
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,740
But why would you need to?

2805
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:20,281
Well,

2806
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:20,971
I'm not saying I do,

2807
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:22,560
but I mean that's a
skill some people have.

2808
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,270
There's great monologue
joke writers and stuff,

2809
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:29,600
but if I see something that's ridiculous
that I'm like perplex by or I think is

2810
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:31,020
funny,

2811
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,100
I can devote attention and
energy into making that funny.

2812
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:35,731
Yeah.

2813
01:11:35,731 --> 01:11:37,110
I say just concentrate on that.

2814
01:11:37,111 --> 01:11:38,010
Fuck all that other stuff.

2815
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:38,460
I mean that's,

2816
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,211
that's what I do.

2817
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,640
I am in awe of certain
people where you could go,

2818
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:41,860
oh,

2819
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:42,693
here's a topic.

2820
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,890
Give me 50 jokes.

2821
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:45,270
And they'll have them and they're good.

2822
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,570
But you notice that those guys usually
wind up working as writers and they

2823
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:49,160
always,

2824
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:49,331
yeah,

2825
01:11:49,331 --> 01:11:50,490
I feel kind of shitty.

2826
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:51,990
That's a lot of them do.

2827
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,100
That's not a good guy.

2828
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:57,000
When you're a great comic and you're
working as a writer on a Sitcom,

2829
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,840
that's a,

2830
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,500
that's a bad,

2831
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,640
and you were talking about it earlier.

2832
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,860
I know a few guys like Owen Smith,

2833
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:02,150
you know,

2834
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:02,951
and I don't know him.

2835
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:03,300
No,

2836
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,480
but I've heard the name one of the
best fucking standups in the country.

2837
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,890
He's so good.

2838
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:08,971
He has his bit.

2839
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:12,480
I don't want to tell you much about it
because it's about adopting a white son.

2840
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,320
It is one of the funniest bits
I've ever seen in my fucking life.

2841
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,270
It's so good that you're like,

2842
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:19,650
holy shit,

2843
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,431
it's so,

2844
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:22,290
it's so fucking twisted.

2845
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,370
And so,

2846
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:23,530
uh,

2847
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,000
it's so like you can't believe
what he's saying while he's saying,

2848
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,950
but this is a guy that is,

2849
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,230
I mean skill wise,

2850
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,730
one of the best standup
comics in the country.

2851
01:12:32,731 --> 01:12:33,030
Yeah.

2852
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:37,740
But he's not known for it as much as
he's got a real career as a writer,

2853
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:38,120
you know,

2854
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,170
and he's trying to branch
out and move away from that.

2855
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,930
But God damn that guy murders
when he's in the comedy store,

2856
01:12:42,931 --> 01:12:44,250
I always sit in the back
of the room and watch.

2857
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:44,420
Yeah.

2858
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,330
When a lot of people,

2859
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:47,200
I guess with families and
kids get to make decisions

2860
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,570
that already think stuck with me when
it's like you want to be doing something

2861
01:12:51,571 --> 01:12:52,404
you don't care about.

2862
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,401
So to me,

2863
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,500
I have to write about things
that I'm interested in.

2864
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:55,681
Like,

2865
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:56,461
I think people,

2866
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:57,990
the people's careers that I wanted,

2867
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,833
the people that I envy,

2868
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,620
their careers seem to be
led by their interests.

2869
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,430
Yeah.

2870
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:03,360
Things that interest them.

2871
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,960
Yeah.

2872
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,190
Well that's a better life.

2873
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:05,820
Yeah.

2874
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,271
You know,

2875
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:06,601
I,

2876
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:06,901
uh,

2877
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:07,860
I've done both.

2878
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:08,401
I've done,

2879
01:13:08,401 --> 01:13:09,630
like when I was doing fear factor,

2880
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:13,170
I wasn't remotely interested in it other
than the paycheck and it was a good

2881
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:13,620
gig.

2882
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,400
I'm not like,

2883
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,111
I'm not shitting on,

2884
01:13:15,111 --> 01:13:15,960
it was a great gig.

2885
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,670
I love that I had that job.

2886
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,250
I love being financially stable,

2887
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:20,590
you know,

2888
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,510
at the time I was like,

2889
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,140
good,

2890
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,940
now I don't have to worry
about paying my bills.

2891
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:24,840
It's a nice thing.

2892
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,970
It was a great group of
people that I work with,

2893
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,710
producers and everybody network.

2894
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:29,544
Everyone's great.

2895
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:33,030
But there's such a difference between
doing that and then doing a podcast.

2896
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:33,720
Oh yeah,

2897
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,890
there's a giant difference.

2898
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:35,740
But that's the way the,

2899
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:38,010
the way that I've kind of
done my podcast is like,

2900
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:39,450
what do I care about?

2901
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,160
What do I want to know about?

2902
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,860
Who can I feasibly get
on to talk about it?

2903
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,960
Those are the things that
are interesting to me.

2904
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:51,380
Not so much like let's just pick a topic
that's in the news that everyone will

2905
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:52,674
have a take on.

2906
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,240
But I mean even even that,

2907
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:55,470
if that's what you're interested in,

2908
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:56,340
something wrong with that.

2909
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:56,670
Of course,

2910
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,421
if you're interested in that.

2911
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:57,660
Yeah,

2912
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,880
but it has a comic to have no boss.

2913
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,250
So that's something nice.

2914
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,800
That's so nice.

2915
01:14:04,801 --> 01:14:05,730
These comics a kit,

2916
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:10,710
they get pigeonholed and stuck into these
gigs where they don't want to fuck up

2917
01:14:10,711 --> 01:14:11,260
the,

2918
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,480
so they don't want to say
anything controversial.

2919
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:16,900
So their material gets bland and some
of them take these big moral stands and

2920
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:17,230
it's like,

2921
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:17,321
well,

2922
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:18,850
you're making a crazy amount of money.

2923
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:19,540
Like some of them are like,

2924
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,830
I won't work here and I will work.

2925
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,970
If that person is on a lineup,

2926
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:22,481
I won't do it.

2927
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:22,841
And I'm like,

2928
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:23,021
yeah,

2929
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:25,320
but you're making a lot of money that,

2930
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,650
that drives me crazy.

2931
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:28,210
It's crazy that I'm
not going to work with,

2932
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,610
unless someone's stealing.

2933
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:30,140
Right.

2934
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:30,610
Just stop.

2935
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:33,790
Unless someone is stealing or they're
punching people or there being a rapist or

2936
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,190
something.

2937
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,470
I mean this is something so egregious.

2938
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:36,550
They should probably be in jail.

2939
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:37,623
Like what?

2940
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,010
You got creative differences.

2941
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,450
You fucking baby,

2942
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,673
get over it.

2943
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,850
Just get up there.

2944
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,150
Yeah.

2945
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,440
I've worked with a lot of people.

2946
01:14:44,441 --> 01:14:46,800
I don't enjoy working and I
don't have the luxury of light,

2947
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:47,460
you know,

2948
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:48,100
I'm going to,

2949
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,230
I won't work this venue because
this person worked here.

2950
01:14:50,231 --> 01:14:50,860
It's like that's it.

2951
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,450
That's good.

2952
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:51,940
You know?

2953
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,121
Well,

2954
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:52,954
I still don't,

2955
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,900
I mean at the store that this,

2956
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,340
I'm there all the time with
people I don't even hardly know.

2957
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:57,880
Right.

2958
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,331
You know what I mean?

2959
01:14:58,331 --> 01:14:58,541
You're,

2960
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,730
you're on a lineup with 1415 people.

2961
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,300
Yeah.

2962
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:01,511
That,

2963
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:02,470
but that's good too.

2964
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:06,440
That's true to half of those people
could be rapists more than half.

2965
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:07,443
Right.

2966
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,910
So that sounds like who is definitely,

2967
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,860
it's a clip right there.

2968
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,640
Depends on whose
definition the actual rape.

2969
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,080
Right now it's like words,

2970
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:17,963
right?

2971
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,690
You gotta be fucking careful.

2972
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,333
Trill.

2973
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,710
That's where we come in.

2974
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,790
That's where it's very confusing,

2975
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,211
right?

2976
01:15:25,211 --> 01:15:27,040
Because we as comics,

2977
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,560
especially comics like you
and I that say fucked up shit,

2978
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:32,890
you can get away with things that are
really not supposed to be in society

2979
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:33,490
anymore.

2980
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:36,370
So sometimes people will get up and
leave and like it's fine to believe like,

2981
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:36,910
hey,

2982
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:37,960
I'm joking.

2983
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,190
Don't you get that?

2984
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:39,940
I'm joking.

2985
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,010
You drunk in a room,

2986
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:43,730
isn't it 1130 at night,

2987
01:15:43,731 --> 01:15:45,190
eight or your if you perform earlier.

2988
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:45,761
But with me,

2989
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:46,031
I'm like,

2990
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:48,640
isn't it 4:00 AM what's the problem?

2991
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:48,971
Right?

2992
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:51,350
If you can't take this opinion
now when you get a tick,

2993
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,001
yeah,

2994
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:53,830
and sometimes it's not good.

2995
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,131
Yeah.

2996
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:55,350
Sometimes the materials,

2997
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,490
not those Parkland kids had
never worked where I said,

2998
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,080
I don't want anyone to get shot,

2999
01:15:59,081 --> 01:15:59,501
but the kids,

3000
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:00,970
these kids are knowing
these five are annoying.

3001
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:01,571
I said,

3002
01:16:01,571 --> 01:16:02,740
I don't want anyone to get shot.

3003
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,400
I don't want any.

3004
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:03,880
So I said,

3005
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,810
let's ban guns.

3006
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,730
But first we have to shoot these kits.

3007
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,350
We have to kill the pocket kits.

3008
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:08,861
These five,

3009
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:12,640
we have to shoot the phones out of their
hands and they're going to be the last,

3010
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:13,331
and we could explain to them,

3011
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:13,990
we're going to go,

3012
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,860
we're banning guns.

3013
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,180
You'll be less five people to ever die.

3014
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:17,920
And it didn't work.

3015
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,910
And people's people were not
exactly thrilled with it,

3016
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,370
but it's like you should be able to trust,

3017
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,510
you should be able to try.

3018
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,970
You've got to trust sometimes like,

3019
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,250
you know,

3020
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,120
you were saying you go onstage with a
premise and then in the middle of doing

3021
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:31,631
that premise,

3022
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:32,710
you'll find the beats.

3023
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,820
Sometimes you don't find the beats and
he think maybe there's something there.

3024
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,240
I've,

3025
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,600
I've had a few bits where I was
sure there was something there.

3026
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,070
I've never been offended by a joke.

3027
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:42,970
That's me personally.

3028
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:43,991
Like I've never,

3029
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:45,400
have you ever been offended by a joke?

3030
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:45,671
No,

3031
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:46,840
I've never been offended,

3032
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:47,770
but I've been like,

3033
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,160
oh,

3034
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,300
that one wasn't good.

3035
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:49,760
You,

3036
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,593
but that's normal.

3037
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,150
Yeah.

3038
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:52,780
It's um,

3039
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,021
the,

3040
01:16:53,021 --> 01:16:57,130
the finding the beats on stage
in front of a live crowd too.

3041
01:16:57,131 --> 01:17:00,850
There's something about that high wire
act that makes your brain go to these

3042
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,890
weird places that comes
up with punchlines.

3043
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,020
You have to fucking find a punchline.

3044
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,340
You have to find something funny.

3045
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:06,821
You have to,

3046
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:07,750
these people paid money.

3047
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,221
It's like,

3048
01:17:08,221 --> 01:17:08,410
dude,

3049
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,130
it's like waving a steak
in front of our junk

3050
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,520
yard dog and you keep tossing them
little bits and then eventually like you

3051
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:17,100
don't have to tromp mistake and
sometimes there's no punchline.

3052
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,890
This is part of the fucking Gig.

3053
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:20,510
Then you got to shit.

3054
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,730
Trump rally just screaming.

3055
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:23,743
She sent us.

3056
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,060
If he doesn't get elected,

3057
01:17:26,061 --> 01:17:29,360
do you think he goes and starts
a podcast TV network he took?

3058
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,260
Totally could.

3059
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:30,680
Yeah.

3060
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,570
He totally could probably
be better for him,

3061
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,110
honestly.

3062
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,550
That's what he thought he was gonna do.

3063
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:35,990
I think before he got elected,

3064
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:40,040
I think he was having high level meetings
with people in the media space to

3065
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:41,300
start something like that.

3066
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:41,511
Well,

3067
01:17:41,511 --> 01:17:45,560
once NBC fired him and BC fired him
while he was running because of the stuff

3068
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:49,280
that he said about Mexico and the thrill
of rape is someone's doing the raping,

3069
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,373
right?

3070
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:51,121
To Hey,

3071
01:17:51,121 --> 01:17:51,830
talk to this.

3072
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,310
So fucking crazy out of control
for a person running for president.

3073
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,031
NBC is like,

3074
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:56,391
that's it.

3075
01:17:56,391 --> 01:17:56,901
We're getting rid of you.

3076
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:59,420
And then they put Arnold in his
place and that was a disaster.

3077
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,231
Do you remember that?

3078
01:18:00,231 --> 01:18:01,450
People Forgot Arnold,

3079
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,600
the host of the apprentice.

3080
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,593
You'll fire.

3081
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:03,900
Yeah.

3082
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,270
Was it was horrible.

3083
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:06,104
It was terrible.

3084
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,460
Trump was shitting on them.

3085
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,550
Did they just scrapped
the show after that?

3086
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,793
Here's a question.

3087
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,350
Does he go back to the apprentice?

3088
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,151
Well,

3089
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,980
if NBC has had the presidency,

3090
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,180
I think he's too toxic.

3091
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,063
Toxic,

3092
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,233
toxic.

3093
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,460
Maybe you could come up with
something like that for Fox.

3094
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:25,611
Oh,

3095
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,290
Fox is in the scoop him up.

3096
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,360
That's what's great about Fox.

3097
01:18:28,361 --> 01:18:29,194
They'll play ball,

3098
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:30,723
play ball.

3099
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,660
They're not going to
leave money on the cable.

3100
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:33,471
You know what though?

3101
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,220
They did want Megan Kelly back to like,

3102
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:36,830
well she did a thing.

3103
01:18:36,831 --> 01:18:39,080
I used to do the show red eye on Fox News,

3104
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,050
which was comics would
just try to be funny.

3105
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:45,680
It was the air did it like 3:00 AM east
coast time and I saw her the week she

3106
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:49,070
was doing that and she was in like the
dressing room and she knew she shouldn't

3107
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:49,850
have left.

3108
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:50,690
She can feel it.

3109
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,220
She had already made the decision,

3110
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:56,300
but you could kind of see it in her
face that I think she knew that she was

3111
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:58,700
going to try to be this
daytime TV queen and like,

3112
01:18:58,701 --> 01:18:59,750
let's bake cupcakes.

3113
01:18:59,751 --> 01:19:00,380
You know,

3114
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:03,200
I just spent four years on Fox News
talking about Santa Fe and white,

3115
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,210
but now let's bake cupcakes cause I'm,

3116
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:06,710
I'm America's sweetheart.

3117
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,630
That's never going to work.

3118
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:08,781
Well,

3119
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:11,750
it's weird when you
publicly change your image,

3120
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:13,483
it's insane.

3121
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:14,960
Publicly changing your image.

3122
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:17,690
Her shirts or skirts got longer.

3123
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,230
Oh yeah,

3124
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,780
she covered her neck or yeah.

3125
01:19:19,781 --> 01:19:20,010
You know,

3126
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,200
it was no more cleavage.

3127
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,940
Every show was about sexual assault.

3128
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:23,620
She was trying to make,

3129
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,520
every single show is about sexual assault.

3130
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,700
I think she was trying to ingratiate
herself in with the people that hated her,

3131
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,410
which is like the New York media types.

3132
01:19:31,411 --> 01:19:32,570
The people that did not like her.

3133
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:33,404
And then she was like,

3134
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,420
but it wasn't even just
about sexual assault.

3135
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:40,430
One of them was a lady who fuck Matt
Lauer and she knew she was fucking him and

3136
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:41,540
she was talking about a lot of shit.

3137
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:41,901
Fucked him.

3138
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:42,290
Well,

3139
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,041
I didn't know any better.

3140
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:43,880
I was 25

3141
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,910
25 if fuck the guy,

3142
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:48,740
fuck what happened.

3143
01:19:48,741 --> 01:19:49,610
It's bad here.

3144
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:50,180
Right?

3145
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,800
Well he shouldn't have fucked
it cause he was married.

3146
01:19:51,801 --> 01:19:52,220
Okay.

3147
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,053
After that,

3148
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:53,900
what happened?

3149
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,970
What's going on then you just fucked him.

3150
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,290
But who cares?

3151
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,300
Why is this a segment of a show?

3152
01:19:59,301 --> 01:20:00,500
Is it because it's scandalous?

3153
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,970
Get an interview with her.

3154
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:03,050
Great.

3155
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:03,321
Yeah,

3156
01:20:03,321 --> 01:20:03,721
it was like,

3157
01:20:03,721 --> 01:20:03,971
you know,

3158
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:04,611
and she was saying,

3159
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:04,821
you know,

3160
01:20:04,821 --> 01:20:06,730
I was young and I was impressionable.

3161
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:08,343
Sure.

3162
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:08,671
Of course.

3163
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:11,310
It's funny to see them all put
nails in each other's coffins.

3164
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,280
Right.

3165
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,113
He's not great.

3166
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:14,580
Media is like this blood feud.

3167
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:16,800
There's only a few families that
control all of this information.

3168
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:17,700
They all hate each other.

3169
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,010
That's why succession
is such a great show.

3170
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,900
Well I think with Megan it was like that.

3171
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:26,280
She had been sexually harassed while she
was at Fox News going after all those

3172
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:27,030
two gals.

3173
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:27,780
Yeah.

3174
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,360
So she was going after and
I think bill O'Reilly too.

3175
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,420
I think there was some
something he paid 38 million.

3176
01:20:33,421 --> 01:20:34,254
So it's like,

3177
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:35,910
what did he do?

3178
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:42,050
I think it was 32 32 and
38 guy and my grants,

3179
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,110
my grandfather still hasn't bill
O'Reilly patriots welcome doormat.

3180
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,153
Wow.

3181
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,360
You know it's a good Matt.

3182
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,010
I mean a mansion.

3183
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:52,050
That's a giant amount of money.

3184
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:55,500
It's the amount of money
where what he did should be,

3185
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:56,430
I mean it seems like it's an,

3186
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:58,110
it could be a Netflix documentary.

3187
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:59,270
Let's going to be hot.

3188
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,330
It's like horrific.

3189
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,190
Like he offered her 37 million.

3190
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,870
She's like no,

3191
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:04,970
keep going.

3192
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:05,630
Yeah.

3193
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,463
Yeah.

3194
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:07,860
Right.

3195
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:11,700
I'm going to need more after what you
did to me is a $32 million offense.

3196
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:12,601
We'll do.

3197
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:17,100
Is that one recording that had left on
some assistance entry and macrus woman.

3198
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:17,590
Yeah.

3199
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:19,760
Touch loofa sponge or something.

3200
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,290
That's what he was trying to do.

3201
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,990
That's how creepy old guy move.

3202
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:27,300
Get you with a sponge to an interesting,

3203
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,830
he tried to have his ex wife.

3204
01:21:28,831 --> 01:21:31,530
You tried to have his ex wife
excommunicated from the church.

3205
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,200
What great did it.

3206
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,101
Oh he tried.

3207
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:36,000
I mean know the why.

3208
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,950
Well cause he wanted her to go to hell.

3209
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,260
A church.

3210
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:43,140
You do what kind of donation you have to
make to get your ex wife sent to hell?

3211
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,190
Probably 32 million.

3212
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:45,743
He's got it,

3213
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,580
but he wanted her ex communicated.

3214
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:48,510
That's type of guy.

3215
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:48,990
He is.

3216
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:49,111
Well,

3217
01:21:49,111 --> 01:21:50,730
the crazy thing is even after all this,

3218
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:55,080
the guy's still had the number one book
in The New York Times because people dig

3219
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:55,320
it.

3220
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:55,831
They still,

3221
01:21:55,831 --> 01:21:56,820
those old fuckers,

3222
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:57,570
they just give in.

3223
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:58,111
They dig in,

3224
01:21:58,111 --> 01:21:58,590
they don't care.

3225
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,310
They like him.

3226
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,660
They might know who he is.

3227
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:01,290
Folksy.

3228
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:02,550
He's like my uncle.

3229
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,660
He's a good man.

3230
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,540
He's spent $40 million for some woman.

3231
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:07,374
He touch it.

3232
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,730
The tide goes in,

3233
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:11,040
the tide goes out with God.

3234
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:12,060
I'm with God.

3235
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,970
That what he was doing that
that fucking Todd goes in,

3236
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:15,661
the tide goes out.

3237
01:22:15,661 --> 01:22:16,471
You can't explain it.

3238
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:16,681
One.

3239
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:17,161
I was like,

3240
01:22:17,161 --> 01:22:17,820
wow,

3241
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:18,750
you went to Harvard,

3242
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:19,950
you fucking piece of shit.

3243
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:20,261
Yeah.

3244
01:22:20,261 --> 01:22:23,520
Well you could explain
that those guys are,

3245
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:27,240
they were religion like a fuck.

3246
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:28,860
It's fashionable to wear it.

3247
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:29,873
They wear it.

3248
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,753
They know

3249
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:32,933
Trump does.

3250
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,230
He gets out and he goes,

3251
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:35,160
I'm a Christian.

3252
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,390
I may not be the best Christian,

3253
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:39,150
but I'm a Christian
leadership quality enough.

3254
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,193
It's good enough.

3255
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:40,920
You know?

3256
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,500
And you're like not the best Christian.

3257
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:48,740
You're a thrice married guy who owns
gambling and a Miss Universe pageant.

3258
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:54,870
You're a biblical fig that's like a
biblical figure that would be like a Roman

3259
01:22:54,871 --> 01:22:59,100
king that everybody was warned
about like gay in terms of like,

3260
01:22:59,101 --> 01:22:59,934
I mean,

3261
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:01,470
I want him to shave his head.

3262
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:02,940
What do you think that will do?

3263
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:04,440
I just freedom.

3264
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:07,570
I think it would funny if you shaved it
like somebody had a cancer issue and he

3265
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:09,730
just shaved it with them to be a good guy.

3266
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:10,061
Well,

3267
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:11,170
it doesn't look good.

3268
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,400
That's what's confusing to me.

3269
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:13,840
Like when I realized as a style,

3270
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,000
when my hair wasn't looking good,

3271
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:16,730
you got rid of,

3272
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,010
it was impossible to look good.

3273
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:19,270
It was fallen out to the point where like,

3274
01:23:19,271 --> 01:23:20,380
this is just a mess.

3275
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,150
Then I went and buzzed it,

3276
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:22,961
but he,

3277
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:23,320
uh,

3278
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,600
I just can't this to my generation,

3279
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:26,730
I always remembered she would like the,

3280
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:28,250
just the herald virile.

3281
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:29,310
Yeah.

3282
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:29,950
It's nice.

3283
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:30,400
I've been,

3284
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,780
I've been like this for a long time.

3285
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,530
Yeah,

3286
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,071
I'm solid.

3287
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:34,950
Eight plus years bald.

3288
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,780
You want Trump to just go,

3289
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,370
hmm.

3290
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,690
I think you'd be better off.

3291
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,620
It'd be easier.

3292
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,880
Like he's not good looking.

3293
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,460
He was know that he would,

3294
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,860
that would complete his
transformation into a supervillain,

3295
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,200
I guess like a Lex Luthor type Gal.

3296
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:51,020
Yeah,

3297
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,240
but it just like,

3298
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:53,074
I just

3299
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,740
gotta be so much work to
put that hair together.

3300
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:58,210
I think someone does it from,

3301
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,030
but even then you've got to talk to
them while they're putting it together.

3302
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:02,380
I bet you he hasn't talked to them.

3303
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:02,741
Everything.

3304
01:24:02,741 --> 01:24:03,820
He does just tweets angry.

3305
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:07,690
I bet he's not concerned with the
human relations with his staff.

3306
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:07,970
No.

3307
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,040
Let's just get that vibe.

3308
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:10,540
Five.

3309
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:10,961
I get that.

3310
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:11,201
Five,

3311
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:13,900
the person who's in charge of
the hair just does the hair.

3312
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,420
I hope he retired when he
retires or when he's done.

3313
01:24:16,421 --> 01:24:18,160
I hope he goes right into podcasting.

3314
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,200
Would you have them on right now?

3315
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:20,950
Yes.

3316
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:21,101
Yeah,

3317
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:21,491
of course.

3318
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:21,970
You have to.

3319
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:22,510
You have to.

3320
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:22,870
Yeah,

3321
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:23,410
yeah,

3322
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:23,740
yeah,

3323
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,310
for sure.

3324
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,940
Yeah.

3325
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:25,420
Yeah.

3326
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:25,811
Why not?

3327
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:29,410
Why wouldn't he come
on a three hours hours?

3328
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,660
He's busy and I had some jokes about them.

3329
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:33,910
He's petty.

3330
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:34,900
He hates comedy.

3331
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,000
He does not like to be made fun of.

3332
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:38,530
He doesn't like to be made fun of.

3333
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:43,180
I'm sure Michelle Wolf got him on Twitter
a few times of correspondence center

3334
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:44,110
and he went after her,

3335
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:45,830
but she can't write back at him and shit.

3336
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,580
I bet you'd be on my side
if I killed the journalist.

3337
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:49,443
Yeah.

3338
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,340
Yeah.

3339
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,460
Michelle is a kill shot.

3340
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,700
Kill Shot.

3341
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:53,533
You're not going to win.

3342
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:54,161
Yeah,

3343
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:54,611
she's,

3344
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:57,460
she's snuffed him out and
she'll just forget it.

3345
01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:00,430
He just dropped off the face of the
earth without always duck out and it was

3346
01:25:00,431 --> 01:25:01,264
done.

3347
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:03,580
She neutered him one tweet.

3348
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:04,300
Neutered.

3349
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:04,661
Yeah.

3350
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:08,140
There's some people that go after him
though and it doesn't work and he doesn't

3351
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:09,730
respond that it looks so weird.

3352
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,620
It's weird when I see
my aunt tweeting at him,

3353
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:12,483
I'm like,

3354
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:16,240
what do you think this is going to do?

3355
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,760
My aunt with 43 followers,

3356
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,713
she say,

3357
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,363
um,

3358
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,120
you were disgusting
representation of this country.

3359
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:27,370
She'll tweet this and then I have another
hand who's the other side that'll be

3360
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:28,060
like,

3361
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,040
I believe in you keep going.

3362
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:33,640
And I just imagined him scrolling
through these messages and reading this.

3363
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:34,441
Do you think he looked,

3364
01:25:34,441 --> 01:25:35,310
looks at and he,

3365
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,570
I think he only looks
at verified accounts.

3366
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,561
I think he's got,

3367
01:25:38,561 --> 01:25:40,780
like if you're thinking about how
many people he follows on Twitter,

3368
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:41,950
I think if he's wise,

3369
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,390
he doesn't see the mentioned.

3370
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,320
I'll tell you right now,

3371
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:46,090
his biggest fans are not verified.

3372
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:51,820
His biggest fans and not have a blue
check are under a hundred followers.

3373
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:53,950
They have dog like the,

3374
01:25:53,951 --> 01:25:54,670
his biggest fan,

3375
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:55,630
not just the people that voted for him.

3376
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:57,920
The people that are still
like in love with them.

3377
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,840
A lot of them have dog profile
pictures like a dog that recently died.

3378
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,460
There's a lot of dead dogs,

3379
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,323
floating flies,

3380
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,060
book flags and the banners and Marilyn,

3381
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,950
none of them have ever
served in the military.

3382
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:10,640
Right.

3383
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,690
But they will have the flag.

3384
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,800
They all have the flag.

3385
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,873
No one's ever served.

3386
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,330
And I'm 43 to 48 followers.

3387
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,473
Magda,

3388
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:22,420
I know in the proffer
Hashtag Maga Hashtag Mag,

3389
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:22,671
you know,

3390
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:23,630
a lot of them aren't real.

3391
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:24,750
Do you know that?

3392
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,460
What are they,

3393
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:26,390
the Russian bots?

3394
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:28,250
It's real.

3395
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:28,431
Yeah,

3396
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:30,380
it was a guy in Russia who's got that job.

3397
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,120
It's not kind,

3398
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,110
it was personnel on long island.

3399
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,450
There's a lot of people that have them.

3400
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:37,390
They have various accounts
they use interested.

3401
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,130
There's a woman named Renee duressed it,

3402
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:40,310
she's coming on the podcast soon.

3403
01:26:40,311 --> 01:26:42,510
She did a study of this for,

3404
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,583
uh,

3405
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:44,540
I forget what she did it for,

3406
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:46,310
but she was on Sam Harris' podcast,

3407
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:47,180
which she went in depth with it.

3408
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:47,321
I'll,

3409
01:26:47,321 --> 01:26:48,440
I'll send it to you after we're done,

3410
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:48,950
please.

3411
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,360
It's fucking amazing.

3412
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,160
But they did all kinds of crazy shit.

3413
01:26:52,161 --> 01:26:55,640
Like they would have like a pro
Muslim group and they would put on a

3414
01:26:55,641 --> 01:26:59,000
demonstration right across the
street from a pro Texas group.

3415
01:26:59,001 --> 01:27:00,350
And they would organize both of them.

3416
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:01,431
They would really,

3417
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:01,571
yeah.

3418
01:27:01,571 --> 01:27:01,761
Yeah.

3419
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:02,531
They organize.

3420
01:27:02,531 --> 01:27:03,364
So discord,

3421
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,550
they would organize,

3422
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:04,971
uh,

3423
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:06,360
African Americans at Kent's,

3424
01:27:06,361 --> 01:27:07,460
Hillary Clinton,

3425
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:08,930
anyone but Hillary,

3426
01:27:08,931 --> 01:27:10,130
we got a vote for Jill Stein.

3427
01:27:10,131 --> 01:27:10,881
We've got to vote for anyway.

3428
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:11,714
And they would like,

3429
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,430
she doesn't represent us.

3430
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:14,420
And this is all Russians.

3431
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:14,661
Yeah.

3432
01:27:14,661 --> 01:27:18,800
And then they would have other people
that were like pro Bernie and then Hillary

3433
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:19,970
fucked over Bernie.

3434
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:21,260
And these were Russians as well.

3435
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:21,591
Hey,

3436
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:24,440
we'll just fall meant coups
and overthrowing their leaders.

3437
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:25,251
It's nice.

3438
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:26,420
It will just kill their people.

3439
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,010
We don't fuck with their social media.

3440
01:27:28,011 --> 01:27:29,370
I think we fuck with her social media.

3441
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,710
I'm sure we do.

3442
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,161
I'm sure there's,

3443
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:34,310
like I wrote off a lot of that Russian
stuff is like people's wishful thinking,

3444
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:35,450
but the more and more I read about it,

3445
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:39,830
the more there is like a coordinated
attempt seemingly to institute this social

3446
01:27:39,831 --> 01:27:40,880
media and so this girl,

3447
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:41,420
yeah,

3448
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:41,661
yeah,

3449
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:45,350
there's 100% a real thing going on
because this woman documented it and two,

3450
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:48,350
it was also really funny like she was
talking about how many of the memes that

3451
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:49,910
they created that were really funny.

3452
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,151
Oh,

3453
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:50,984
they're hilarious.

3454
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,310
And they came out of Russia.

3455
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:57,170
So there's a bunch of guys in a room in
Moscow creating memes and it's so funny.

3456
01:27:57,171 --> 01:28:00,860
This is like they went to KGB
training or whatever it is now FSP,

3457
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:04,220
and this is where they
ended up just hiring people.

3458
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,490
This is the frontier of the
war against the United States.

3459
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,570
The thing is though,

3460
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:13,190
if they can do that and get people
really upset if they really can't do it,

3461
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:15,020
that's a really effective strategy.

3462
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,910
It's a great strategy.

3463
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:19,130
Can make things happen now cause it's
just sewing internal discord and we're

3464
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:20,420
going to collapse her own system.

3465
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,080
Like I wonder how many of these Jesse
Small lay a is that I see his name,

3466
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:24,950
Jesse smell A's,

3467
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,341
Russian.

3468
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,310
The whole thing is rushing.

3469
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,630
Not even real thing is rushing.

3470
01:28:28,631 --> 01:28:30,020
Jessie Smollett doesn't exist.

3471
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:34,190
I wonder how many of the memes were
created by Russians to try to get people

3472
01:28:34,191 --> 01:28:34,581
upset.

3473
01:28:34,581 --> 01:28:35,750
I bet there's bunch.

3474
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:39,590
I bet there's more people stirring things
up then just Temaze Americans that are

3475
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:40,011
upset.

3476
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:40,370
I know,

3477
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:41,540
I'm sure it's people that are,

3478
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:44,690
but then there's also just a lot
of Americans that hate each other.

3479
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:45,540
Does that?

3480
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:45,850
Yeah.

3481
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:46,683
Yeah.

3482
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:47,420
There's that.

3483
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,200
But then you also,

3484
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,400
what do you think happens with Jesse?

3485
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:53,000
Small light his empire because
ABC got rid of Roseanne for tweet.

3486
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,770
You got to get rid of this guy.

3487
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,060
I thought he was getting canceled.

3488
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,530
He was getting written out rather.

3489
01:28:58,650 --> 01:28:59,481
Did I read today?

3490
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:00,080
But yeah,

3491
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:00,500
I don't know.

3492
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:03,600
I thought he was getting written out
before and this is one of the reasons why

3493
01:29:03,601 --> 01:29:04,170
he did it.

3494
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:04,291
Well,

3495
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,460
I support him if that's the case,

3496
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:06,600
cause he's a very hard business.

3497
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,110
This is a very tough business.

3498
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,273
It is hard.

3499
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:12,240
It's hard to make it.

3500
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:14,520
I loved that they had to plan that
out and he said to the two guys,

3501
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:14,731
he goes,

3502
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:15,564
listen,

3503
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:16,880
get a noose.

3504
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,340
Yeah,

3505
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:17,531
cool.

3506
01:29:17,531 --> 01:29:18,720
Get rope and doing this.

3507
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,640
All a lot of these hate crimes,

3508
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:21,300
it,

3509
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:21,631
first of all,

3510
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:22,950
I hate crimes happen and they're horrible.

3511
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:24,510
But some of these things are fic.

3512
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,890
Do you know he showed up at the hotel
with the new still around his neck holding

3513
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:30,060
a subway sandwich.

3514
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,650
Just that alone,

3515
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:32,670
the people,

3516
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,170
the people at the hotel
should have been like,

3517
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:35,004
what?

3518
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:36,173
What happened?

3519
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:37,163
That's amazing.

3520
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:37,830
Okay,

3521
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:38,663
what happened?

3522
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,710
Why Sandwich juice?

3523
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:41,910
It's still at the sandwich.

3524
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:45,210
And why are you eating at subway or
you're not sick to your stomach or on

3525
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:46,044
empire?

3526
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,310
What the Hell's wrong with you?

3527
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:47,751
[inaudible] so,

3528
01:29:47,751 --> 01:29:49,080
but the subway subway's not good.

3529
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:50,610
It's not bad if you're hungry.

3530
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:51,030
Listen,

3531
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:52,140
I've clearly hating it,

3532
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,453
but it ain't great.

3533
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,590
But if it's like two
o'clock in the morning,

3534
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:56,700
it's the only thing open.

3535
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,400
Why is he open to 2:00
AM that's a great place.

3536
01:29:59,401 --> 01:30:00,170
It's open.

3537
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,130
It's a good move to be open
when nothing else is open.

3538
01:30:02,131 --> 01:30:02,790
It's a good point.

3539
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:03,830
You get a nice Italian.

3540
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:04,800
So I would double meat.

3541
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:06,900
I like to have the oil and vinegar,

3542
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:09,180
salt and pepper ball with the Mozzarella,

3543
01:30:09,181 --> 01:30:09,780
whatever.

3544
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,250
And then you don't toast it.

3545
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:13,680
You let the hot and
meatballs melt the cheese.

3546
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:14,040
Oh,

3547
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,671
I agree with that.

3548
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:15,090
Yeah.

3549
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:15,923
That's a good move.

3550
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:17,093
And he posts up.

3551
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:18,140
It's always a good mark.

3552
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,490
Especially after faking a hate crime

3553
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,970
after he was the hate crime.

3554
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:24,661
I meet both.

3555
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:26,460
How nervous you after you do that?

3556
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:28,170
I'm such a pussy.

3557
01:30:28,171 --> 01:30:29,220
I could never go.

3558
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,210
I could never do what.

3559
01:30:30,211 --> 01:30:31,760
He did some level associates,

3560
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,870
but then I saw that act right dinner
with the other night and I went,

3561
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:34,980
oh he could do that.

3562
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:35,580
Yeah.

3563
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,280
Oh these people can do it cause
they were on another level.

3564
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,630
Well the other thing is that people
say who would want to be a victim?

3565
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:44,010
Who'd want to fake being a victim?

3566
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:45,780
I heard that during the cabin off hearing.

3567
01:30:45,781 --> 01:30:46,614
I was like,

3568
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,960
that is a ridiculous thing to say.

3569
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:52,650
Cause there's a lot of
currency in our business,

3570
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,620
in our business.

3571
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,980
It's a lot of conflict.

3572
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:55,650
Yay.

3573
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:56,483
In the world.

3574
01:30:56,580 --> 01:31:00,360
Like people like praise victims for
showing out and they support them.

3575
01:31:00,361 --> 01:31:01,800
You get a tremendous amount of love,

3576
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,500
especially if you're a legit victim.

3577
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:04,470
Something of course,

3578
01:31:04,471 --> 01:31:04,860
you know,

3579
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,360
I mean there's a lot to that.

3580
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,160
Yeah.

3581
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,120
The idea that no one would do
that is so there's so against it.

3582
01:31:10,121 --> 01:31:11,460
So contrary to human nature,

3583
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:12,660
everyone would do it.

3584
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,740
I want to do it.

3585
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:14,760
What would you do?

3586
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,950
What kind of hate crime would you fake?

3587
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,280
It was great idea.

3588
01:31:17,281 --> 01:31:20,130
I don't know if I got punched
and people saw my face,

3589
01:31:20,131 --> 01:31:21,060
they'd go good.

3590
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:24,300
It deserved it.

3591
01:31:24,301 --> 01:31:25,020
You know what I mean?

3592
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,760
Like nobody would look at my face ago.

3593
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:27,361
Yeah.

3594
01:31:27,361 --> 01:31:28,194
Okay,

3595
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:29,123
good.

3596
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:29,971
Well I wrote,

3597
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:30,930
I tweeted something today.

3598
01:31:30,931 --> 01:31:31,201
I was like,

3599
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:31,321
Hey,

3600
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:34,170
I'm at flappers on a J W was hit.

3601
01:31:34,171 --> 01:31:34,680
Uh,

3602
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:34,960
my,

3603
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,270
the 26 of flappers I was,

3604
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:38,220
it was two guys was
Hollywood would Maga hats.

3605
01:31:38,221 --> 01:31:38,821
They beat me up.

3606
01:31:38,821 --> 01:31:39,631
They poured something on me.

3607
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:40,231
I don't know what it was.

3608
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:43,730
I think it was come
please come to farmers.

3609
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:44,311
But I mean,

3610
01:31:44,311 --> 01:31:44,671
that's the thing.

3611
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:45,504
Listen,

3612
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,060
I watched good morning America
interview this morning.

3613
01:31:48,061 --> 01:31:49,110
I left,

3614
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:50,700
I sent it to my buddy.

3615
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:51,750
I go,

3616
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,590
there's a moment in it.

3617
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:53,340
When they go,

3618
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,600
how'd you know it was he attackers?

3619
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:55,381
And he goes like this.

3620
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:56,214
He goes,

3621
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,570
you could see the insanity.

3622
01:31:57,571 --> 01:31:58,440
You can see in his eyes.

3623
01:31:58,830 --> 01:31:59,261
He goes like this.

3624
01:31:59,261 --> 01:31:59,980
He goes,

3625
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,760
I was there and he just
doing that Shitty actory.

3626
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,720
Oh,

3627
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:06,880
like just fucking shitty acting class.

3628
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,040
That horse shit.

3629
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:11,140
I was there and I'm like,

3630
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:12,670
this is fucking crazy.

3631
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:13,030
Oh,

3632
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:17,440
he was going to inform on two guys if
there were two white guys with Maga hats

3633
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,513
who got caught,

3634
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:21,770
they'd be in jail right now
because the detective said to him,

3635
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:24,160
we have two suspects on camera.

3636
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:25,101
Do you think it's Sam?

3637
01:32:25,101 --> 01:32:25,391
And he's like,

3638
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:25,990
yeah.

3639
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,730
Then he found out it's just
two buddies and he's like,

3640
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:28,121
well,

3641
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:29,380
I can't testify against them.

3642
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:33,220
He was going to testify against two
people who they thought were guilty.

3643
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:34,930
So he said that he thought it was dumb.

3644
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:35,950
Yeah.

3645
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:36,280
Yeah.

3646
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,570
There's a good morning America interview.

3647
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:38,051
Oh,

3648
01:32:38,051 --> 01:32:38,980
have him going?

3649
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:39,641
Yeah.

3650
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:42,760
It's those two that takes it
to another level and then Fox.

3651
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:42,971
He's like,

3652
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:43,091
well,

3653
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:43,811
we start with,

3654
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:44,530
hey,

3655
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:45,910
he's good on the show.

3656
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,110
We stand behind them.

3657
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:50,620
That takes it to a completely different
than there would be people in jail right

3658
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:50,921
now.

3659
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:51,640
He wouldn't care.

3660
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,530
Could you imagine?

3661
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,470
It's crazy.

3662
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:55,960
Could you imagine not
just faking a hate crime,

3663
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:57,970
but then putting people in jail?

3664
01:32:57,971 --> 01:33:00,820
Magic being those two guys
were just sitting in jail like,

3665
01:33:00,821 --> 01:33:04,150
what the fuck you're on the cover
of the New York Post nabbed him,

3666
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:04,841
got him,

3667
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:06,160
got up and they're sitting there like,

3668
01:33:06,161 --> 01:33:07,060
what the fuck?

3669
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:09,040
And everybody wants to kick
their ass every empire.

3670
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,110
Next season is all about Jesse smaller.

3671
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:15,930
They fire everyone else on the show and
it's just to Jesse smallest story and

3672
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:16,840
two innocent people.

3673
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,200
The Gay Tupac wandering
the streets of empire.

3674
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:21,430
That's why people in Ohio,

3675
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:22,280
whenever Hollywood is like,

3676
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,171
here's how to vote.

3677
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:23,590
They go,

3678
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:24,130
you know what?

3679
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:24,963
No.

3680
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:25,600
They go,

3681
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,081
you know what?

3682
01:33:26,081 --> 01:33:26,800
No thank you.

3683
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,700
I see what you're doing.

3684
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:29,560
You fucks fake and hate crimes.

3685
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:31,570
What kind of hate crime would you
fake if you were going to do it?

3686
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:32,810
It's a great class to get ahead.

3687
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:33,970
That's a great question.

3688
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:34,481
What if,

3689
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:36,880
what if someone gave you a
license to fake a hate crime?

3690
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:40,030
Like what if there was a television
show about faking a hate crime?

3691
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,330
That's how they do like punked,

3692
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,060
you know you are fake things like that.

3693
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:44,230
How about you fake a hate crime?

3694
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:45,400
I'd love to do something like that.

3695
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:46,900
True TV presents.

3696
01:33:46,901 --> 01:33:47,261
Yes.

3697
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:48,220
Fake a hate crime.

3698
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:48,910
Yeah.

3699
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:49,061
Yeah.

3700
01:33:49,061 --> 01:33:49,601
It's interesting.

3701
01:33:49,601 --> 01:33:50,350
I don't,

3702
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:52,290
I'm trying to think how this
conference a whole deal.

3703
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:56,170
Maybe a Halaal guy would
attack me in New York City,

3704
01:33:56,171 --> 01:34:01,000
like a Halaal guy would attack me because
he views me as a symbol of imperialism

3705
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:01,834
and oppression.

3706
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:02,970
There'll be good,

3707
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:03,370
you know?

3708
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:05,710
Even though I patronize
his stand all the time,

3709
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,180
he still feels the need to attack.

3710
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:07,391
I mean,

3711
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:07,960
I don't know.

3712
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,130
I could never do that.

3713
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:09,820
No.

3714
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:11,140
I'm one of those people who would get,

3715
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,550
and I wouldn't get caught.

3716
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:13,391
Well,

3717
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:14,920
this would never think
I'd get away with it.

3718
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:18,070
Wanting everyone to think you're a
victim when nothing really happened is

3719
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:20,110
insanely selfish thing.

3720
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:20,860
Yeah.

3721
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:23,410
That's an insane like
faking physical crime.

3722
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:25,960
Ikea to have someone punch
him already hit himself.

3723
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:26,230
Yeah.

3724
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:29,980
These marketers face maggot hat wearing
gangs and everyone's talking about in

3725
01:34:29,981 --> 01:34:32,050
Chicago and La and New York do not exist.

3726
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,660
If you have a maggot hat
on at 2:00 AM in New York,

3727
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:36,200
you're getting bleached poured on you.

3728
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:36,850
Yeah.

3729
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:40,280
Probably reality will also like just,

3730
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:45,310
he was saying that he like punched him
back and he fought back and I love how he

3731
01:34:45,311 --> 01:34:45,880
was like,

3732
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,460
first of all he was on camera
for everything except one minute.

3733
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:49,930
So they ask them to good morning America.

3734
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:50,620
They go,

3735
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,241
how long was this?

3736
01:34:51,241 --> 01:34:52,074
He's like,

3737
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:53,470
it felt like several minutes,

3738
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:55,210
but it could have been 30 seconds.

3739
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:57,440
Like he's covering the
span of time in his,

3740
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:58,550
in his lie,

3741
01:34:58,551 --> 01:34:59,384
he's going,

3742
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:02,570
I got to say it's less than a minute
cause I'm only off camera for a minute.

3743
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:07,180
Whenever you heard about a guy like
kills his wife and blames a black guy.

3744
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:07,670
Yeah.

3745
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:07,881
You know,

3746
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:09,110
there's been a bunch of those,

3747
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:09,291
right.

3748
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:10,124
It's been a ton of,

3749
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:12,380
and then you see the
Energy Simpson for example.

3750
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:13,970
Did he blame something?

3751
01:35:13,971 --> 01:35:14,661
What do you know?

3752
01:35:14,661 --> 01:35:15,740
Somebody probably blamed him,

3753
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:16,690
you think?

3754
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:16,820
Nah,

3755
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:17,200
I'm kidding.

3756
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,010
I remember there was a recent one,

3757
01:35:19,011 --> 01:35:20,330
people were saying that his son did it.

3758
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:20,680
Yeah,

3759
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:20,811
yeah,

3760
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:20,961
yeah.

3761
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:21,980
My mother always believed that.

3762
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:22,370
But again,

3763
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:24,680
that's so fractured
conspiracy theory though.

3764
01:35:24,681 --> 01:35:24,921
Right.

3765
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:26,510
And that's why I don't really get into,

3766
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:27,740
I don't want,

3767
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:28,130
yeah,

3768
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:28,580
that's,

3769
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,930
those are the ones that are out there.

3770
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:30,800
I don't really get into that.

3771
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:31,940
I don't get any of the moon.

3772
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,200
I don't go near a,

3773
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:38,201
I'm not an Oj truther are you a a Gulf
of Tonkin guy or operation Northwoods?

3774
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:39,770
Those are all true.

3775
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:40,710
There's nothing,

3776
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:41,480
there's nothing.

3777
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,790
Those are all true operation
Northwoods is my favorite.

3778
01:35:43,791 --> 01:35:44,624
Crazy.

3779
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:45,200
Yeah.

3780
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,420
They stay talked about bombing a ship.

3781
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:48,080
Yeah.

3782
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,040
With people on it.

3783
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:52,610
And they were going to blow up a drone
jetliner and blame it on the Cubans.

3784
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:53,530
They were gonna.

3785
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:56,270
They were gonna attack Guantanamo Bay arm,

3786
01:35:56,271 --> 01:35:59,090
Cuban friendlies and have
them attack autonomo crazy.

3787
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:00,290
Yeah.

3788
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:00,411
Yeah.

3789
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:01,130
That was not,

3790
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,090
that was not that long ago.

3791
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:02,480
I know.

3792
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,740
That's why we need you back.

3793
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:05,023
I can't do it.

3794
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,940
We know what mercy's are too fucking.

3795
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:08,940
It's too exhausts.

3796
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:11,660
I got exhausted cause I would do a shell
and then somebody would come up to me

3797
01:36:11,661 --> 01:36:13,130
after this show and they'd be like,

3798
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,440
they'd show me a pizza menu.

3799
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,001
I swear to God.

3800
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:15,530
And they go,

3801
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,363
you see that?

3802
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,440
And I got nice.

3803
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,121
Well what is it?

3804
01:36:18,121 --> 01:36:18,321
They go,

3805
01:36:18,321 --> 01:36:19,460
that's the nambla symbol.

3806
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:20,481
And I'm like,

3807
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:22,790
it says like it says garlic knots.

3808
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:23,683
And they're like,

3809
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:26,271
no.

3810
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:26,541
They're like,

3811
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:27,650
you had to really look at it.

3812
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:28,250
Oh.

3813
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:28,791
And I'm like,

3814
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:29,060
all right,

3815
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,670
I can't go with the rest
of my life with that.

3816
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:33,590
Well they look for it and everything.

3817
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,060
Everything's a conspiracy.

3818
01:36:35,061 --> 01:36:38,270
And then when it comes
back to you and they say,

3819
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:38,631
oh,

3820
01:36:38,631 --> 01:36:39,980
Tim is involved in this,

3821
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:40,370
right?

3822
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:40,910
And then you go,

3823
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:41,211
oh,

3824
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:42,140
I see how this works.

3825
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:43,220
You don't just make shit up.

3826
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:43,550
Yeah.

3827
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:44,630
And then they believe it.

3828
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:45,531
Yeah.

3829
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:47,630
The CIA is now getting
involved in podcasting.

3830
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,111
Yes.

3831
01:36:48,111 --> 01:36:48,651
Do you guys,

3832
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:49,610
you're their first shelf,

3833
01:36:49,611 --> 01:36:52,050
but they're going to get a few
others on the deeply involved in.

3834
01:36:52,051 --> 01:36:54,330
Steve started the rush and Troy,

3835
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,350
I love the idea of the CIA going
and watching PSATs and be like,

3836
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:02,420
who's getting passed at the store?

3837
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:02,781
Oh,

3838
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:03,590
you don't know.

3839
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:08,590
I have a friend of mine who thinks that
the CIA started Jim Morrison and Jimi

3840
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:09,290
Hendrix.

3841
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:13,400
There's a book about that called Weird
scenes inside the canyon written by a guy

3842
01:37:13,401 --> 01:37:15,530
named Dave McGowan and I'm
going to tell you right now,

3843
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:15,771
Joe,

3844
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:16,610
it's kind of interesting.

3845
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:18,051
I'm going to tell you,

3846
01:37:18,051 --> 01:37:19,340
it's kind of interesting.

3847
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:22,070
There was a lot of shit
going on in Laurel Canyon,

3848
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:23,330
I'm sure probably about pussy.

3849
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:25,060
There was a lot of weird shit going on.

3850
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:25,581
The CIA,

3851
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:27,350
the Rand Corp was all over there.

3852
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:29,330
It was a lot of shit happening.

3853
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:30,620
Well,

3854
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:32,030
I'm sure there was a
lot of shit happening,

3855
01:37:32,031 --> 01:37:36,830
but there is not a fucking intelligence
agency in the world that can create a

3856
01:37:36,831 --> 01:37:38,000
Jimi Hendrix of course,

3857
01:37:38,001 --> 01:37:39,080
and they're not sitting there.

3858
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,310
That book was like that.

3859
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:41,630
They were managing the birds.

3860
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,100
The CIA was like,

3861
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:43,491
they were like,

3862
01:37:43,491 --> 01:37:43,671
no,

3863
01:37:43,671 --> 01:37:47,650
it's mister tambourine was like a CIA
guy to be like it had marine men's.

3864
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:56,410
Imagine being in that time in the country
when everything was just falling apart

3865
01:37:57,361 --> 01:37:58,770
left and right around us.

3866
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:00,360
Vietnam war,

3867
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:01,560
Kent State,

3868
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:06,780
just fucking Nixon's the president
and it's just chaos left and right.

3869
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,010
There's no internet.

3870
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:08,340
Yeah,

3871
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,840
everyone's doing drugs.

3872
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:11,670
It must have been wild.

3873
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,570
It must've been amazing.

3874
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:13,351
I mean,

3875
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:15,960
I always think about that
hunters Thompson quote about,

3876
01:38:15,961 --> 01:38:16,290
uh,

3877
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:16,650
you know,

3878
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:20,850
like we talked about the sixties and that
in the 70s it was almost like the wave

3879
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:24,040
crested and then just it's crashed
act from fear and loathing in Las gas.

3880
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:24,680
Yeah.

3881
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,380
Yeah.

3882
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:26,011
But I'm a big,

3883
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:27,450
like I'm a Kennedy Guy.

3884
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:29,160
I think there's something
really shady with that.

3885
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:29,491
Yeah,

3886
01:38:29,491 --> 01:38:29,971
for sure.

3887
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:30,541
For sure.

3888
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:30,901
For sure.

3889
01:38:30,901 --> 01:38:33,810
And in that book is some amazing stuff
about this book that you gave me.

3890
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:35,970
His family of secrets is a guy,

3891
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:36,481
Russ Baker,

3892
01:38:36,481 --> 01:38:37,710
who's a legit journalist and it's,

3893
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:39,850
it's been praised by like
Dan Rather and Bill Moyers,

3894
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,460
I'm trying to get you in this.

3895
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:42,061
Let me tell you right now.

3896
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:42,900
This will get you in.

3897
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:44,163
He went,

3898
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:45,270
I don't have that kind of time.

3899
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:46,520
George h did you know the choice?

3900
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:50,760
H W Bush called the FBI and said that
he thought he knew who the killer of JFK

3901
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:51,594
was.

3902
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:52,440
Did you know that?

3903
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,273
No,

3904
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:53,970
no.

3905
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:54,930
He called the FBI.

3906
01:38:54,931 --> 01:38:56,160
The in Houston.

3907
01:38:56,370 --> 01:38:57,060
Hey,

3908
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:57,301
what's up?

3909
01:38:57,301 --> 01:38:58,620
It's George George Bush.

3910
01:38:58,621 --> 01:38:59,281
I'm in Tyler,

3911
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:03,690
Texas and I think I know who the killer
is and he informs on this Guy James

3912
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:03,691
Parrot.

3913
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:06,600
And James Parrot ended up
being like one of his staffers.

3914
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,040
It was this weird cover story.

3915
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:12,240
He kind of planted and that came out
in a memo and there was another mental,

3916
01:39:12,241 --> 01:39:13,740
these are declassified FBI memos,

3917
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:14,790
freedom of Information Act.

3918
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:17,790
There was another memo that
said after the assassination,

3919
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:18,630
j Edgar Hoover,

3920
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,820
Pre George Bush and the CIA.

3921
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:23,820
The problem was George Bush should not
have been working for the CIA at that

3922
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:24,450
point.

3923
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:26,010
He should have been
just a private citizen.

3924
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:30,180
So it was suggested he was working for
the agency for a very long time and he

3925
01:39:30,181 --> 01:39:30,860
was made the,

3926
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:31,041
uh,

3927
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:34,860
the director of the agency for one
year after the family jewels came out,

3928
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:36,510
which was this whole thing with the CIA,

3929
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:39,390
went to Congress and they admitted that
they had done all these things from,

3930
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:40,051
you know,

3931
01:39:40,051 --> 01:39:45,051
coups and the fomenting revolutions and
countries and they made him the director

3932
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:51,770
for one year after that happened to break
to make a clean break from all of the

3933
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:54,510
nefarious activities that the
agency had been involved with.

3934
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:58,890
But if you take that memo to mean that
he had had an existing relationship with

3935
01:39:58,891 --> 01:39:59,520
them,

3936
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,570
he was actually just becoming the cause.

3937
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:01,720
No,

3938
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,760
it made no sense to anyone.

3939
01:40:02,761 --> 01:40:03,031
They were like,

3940
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:05,730
why is this guy that everyone called
the lightweight becoming the head of the

3941
01:40:05,731 --> 01:40:09,870
CIA after the CIA just admitted
to all of these horrible things.

3942
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,860
They call him a lightweight.

3943
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,161
Yeah,

3944
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:11,580
they called.

3945
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:11,761
Yeah.

3946
01:40:11,761 --> 01:40:12,181
He was like,

3947
01:40:12,181 --> 01:40:14,470
I think Kissinger had said
to Nixon to kissed her,

3948
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:15,200
said to Nixon,

3949
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:15,891
he's a lightweight,

3950
01:40:15,891 --> 01:40:17,100
commit him ambassador to China.

3951
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:21,180
He was never a guy that had a serious
political capital and he was made the head

3952
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,500
of the CIA and then after
that memo was on earth,

3953
01:40:23,501 --> 01:40:24,334
people were saying,

3954
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:25,530
oh,

3955
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:26,363
he had,

3956
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,900
this was an extension of the coverup.

3957
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:29,460
He was being made,

3958
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:33,510
the director at this very interesting
time in history because he actually had

3959
01:40:33,511 --> 01:40:36,780
worked with the agency forever and
he was not at all a lightweight.

3960
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,250
He was a serious operator and he was
going in there to kind of clean up and

3961
01:40:41,251 --> 01:40:43,200
transition them into a new era.

3962
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:43,710
It's,

3963
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:44,191
I'm telling you,

3964
01:40:44,191 --> 01:40:45,420
I'm already out you.

3965
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:46,390
Yeah.

3966
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:47,100
How are you out?

3967
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,090
I can't listen to them.

3968
01:40:48,150 --> 01:40:48,660
It's good.

3969
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:49,493
It's great though.

3970
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:51,210
I need current shit.

3971
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:54,280
I ended up need like Julian Assange.

3972
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:55,541
I need something bright.

3973
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:57,540
I need some Edward Snowden done.

3974
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:57,970
All right.

3975
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:59,630
You know to the Bush anymore.

3976
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:02,140
I'll get an a Sanje buck.

3977
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:02,990
You can get in there.

3978
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:05,200
I'll listen to Abilene and a clinic.

3979
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:05,830
If you read it,

3980
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:06,430
if you,

3981
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,380
I'll dabble in the clinic.

3982
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:08,920
If you read a chapter of this.

3983
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:09,670
Yeah.

3984
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:10,503
If you read a chapter,

3985
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:11,180
this,

3986
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:12,040
I give me a cookie.

3987
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:14,500
I don't have a cookie.

3988
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:15,491
And if I do,

3989
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:16,324
I'm taking it.

3990
01:41:17,410 --> 01:41:18,520
But you will be.

3991
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:19,150
You'll be,

3992
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:22,150
it's very interesting and it's a well
written book cause it's not reckless and

3993
01:41:22,151 --> 01:41:22,450
slop.

3994
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:23,290
I'll read the first chapter,

3995
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:24,124
I promise.

3996
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:24,551
Thank you.

3997
01:41:24,551 --> 01:41:28,500
I will listen to a buddy
of mine gave me David,

3998
01:41:28,501 --> 01:41:28,780
uh,

3999
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:33,730
liftings best evidence on the Kennedy
assassination and that got me into

4000
01:41:33,731 --> 01:41:34,600
conspiracy theorists.

4001
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:38,170
It's like 92 and I get it.

4002
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:38,620
Sure.

4003
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,390
You're at the end of the
road now where you're like,

4004
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:43,090
this is a lot of people are
full of shit in that world.

4005
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:43,991
A Lot,

4006
01:41:43,991 --> 01:41:44,531
a lot of them.

4007
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:45,940
And that's what people don't realize.

4008
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:49,960
Well then it gets deeper and deeper and
deeper and more and more preposterous.

4009
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:52,900
Have you ever googled Hashtag spaces fake?

4010
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:54,543
No,

4011
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,760
but that's sounds,

4012
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,120
it sounds amazing.

4013
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:02,140
There is a thriving
space is fake community.

4014
01:42:02,141 --> 01:42:03,370
Have you ever been in space?

4015
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:04,571
No.

4016
01:42:04,571 --> 01:42:05,404
Good point.

4017
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:06,583
Could be fake.

4018
01:42:06,610 --> 01:42:07,360
Come back,

4019
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,111
come back to us.

4020
01:42:08,111 --> 01:42:08,321
Joe.

4021
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:09,154
Prove it.

4022
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:11,590
Come back to it.

4023
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:13,300
Well this is an extension of flat earth.

4024
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:16,630
It's like for people to think the
flat earth is too conservative.

4025
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:17,230
They go,

4026
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:17,921
they go deeper.

4027
01:42:17,921 --> 01:42:18,790
It's like it's not stupid.

4028
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:19,560
They go deep.

4029
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,770
Those flat Earth Cox,

4030
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:22,060
they want to move into space.

4031
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:25,820
They want to go to s spaces bank.

4032
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:26,080
Yeah.

4033
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,020
You want to know what's
really up spaces face basis.

4034
01:42:29,021 --> 01:42:29,460
Fake.

4035
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:30,293
Yeah.

4036
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:30,970
Crazy.

4037
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:31,151
What?

4038
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:31,420
I mean,

4039
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:34,510
I think there are hundreds of thousands
of people that think that the earth is

4040
01:42:34,511 --> 01:42:35,230
flat.

4041
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:40,230
Hundreds of thousands educated western
American human beings that think the

4042
01:42:40,631 --> 01:42:41,464
earth is flat.

4043
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:42,700
That is wild.

4044
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,620
It is fucking crazy.

4045
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,310
It's interesting.

4046
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:47,620
It's a lot of people that just
get educated from youtube.

4047
01:42:47,621 --> 01:42:49,180
The Guardian actually
had an article about it.

4048
01:42:49,181 --> 01:42:51,760
I sent it to Eddie and
Eddie's laughed at me.

4049
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:52,031
See,

4050
01:42:52,031 --> 01:42:54,160
I think Eddie's kind of
rational and a lot of ways,

4051
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:58,360
because I had conspiracy talks
with him about what about,

4052
01:42:58,510 --> 01:42:58,811
well,

4053
01:42:58,811 --> 01:42:59,051
yeah,

4054
01:42:59,051 --> 01:42:59,291
no,

4055
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:04,180
the one that we had wasn't saying a
little government was attacking Malibu.

4056
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:04,880
Well,

4057
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:09,130
he's the one that we're talking about
that they were using direct energy weapons

4058
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:09,671
and I was like,

4059
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:11,610
I don't know if this is
tacky Malibu with what?

4060
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:11,921
I was like,

4061
01:43:11,921 --> 01:43:14,020
why would they attack
mallet with of the fires?

4062
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:14,561
But I'm like,

4063
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:14,950
they're rich.

4064
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:16,810
Why would they attack
mal boats to rich people?

4065
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:17,651
Fire started here.

4066
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:18,520
My fucking house.

4067
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:19,550
Did he start a mal?

4068
01:43:19,551 --> 01:43:20,770
But they flew through the air.

4069
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,080
You know I was one of the first evacuated.

4070
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:23,570
Right.

4071
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:24,610
This fucking theories.

4072
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:25,241
You're so stupid.

4073
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,010
It's dry a shit.

4074
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:27,400
Yeah.

4075
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,160
A fire hits and the winds are going.

4076
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:31,660
Co Did they make the wind?

4077
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:32,721
They made the wine.

4078
01:43:32,721 --> 01:43:34,180
I'm sure you always made the wind.

4079
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:37,150
The wind is always been the CIA.

4080
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:38,230
They've always made the wind.

4081
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:38,580
Yeah.

4082
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:39,413
It's fucking,

4083
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,820
it's just any,

4084
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,800
there's no rest.

4085
01:43:41,801 --> 01:43:42,640
There's no peace.

4086
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:43,930
There's no living in the moment.

4087
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:45,820
It's like a certain point.

4088
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:49,390
You got to just don't even want to know
because it's horrible things going on.

4089
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:50,650
There's horrible things going on.

4090
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,590
Okay.

4091
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,040
What do you think is

4092
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,120
like the war shit going on right now?

4093
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:54,380
Human trafficking is very bad,

4094
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:55,250
horrible,

4095
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:55,820
horrible,

4096
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,290
and really dollar industry.

4097
01:43:57,620 --> 01:43:59,120
That's not subway sandwich.

4098
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,290
Artists are paying for that.

4099
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:01,070
Right?

4100
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:02,120
Rich people.

4101
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:06,040
Some of them are involved in
some very bad things and they're,

4102
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:08,090
it's their attraction be they're
covering their own tracks.

4103
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:08,870
Yeah.

4104
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:09,351
Like that.

4105
01:44:09,351 --> 01:44:11,170
Jeffrey Epstein and stuff.

4106
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,770
Dude that the Clinton
visited the least got to.

4107
01:44:13,771 --> 01:44:16,550
I've got some hire anyone with an island

4108
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,370
and hanging out with Bill Clinton.

4109
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,130
If you have an island and you're
hanging out with Bill Clinton,

4110
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:24,013
there's a problem.

4111
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,410
Where's the Mataz?

4112
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:26,740
Yeah,

4113
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:29,500
I mean it's a crazy,

4114
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:32,330
all of that stuff is very disturbing
and he got a sweetheart deal cause he

4115
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:35,690
wouldn't inform on anyone that was on
his plane and now they're low justice

4116
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:36,980
department's looking at that again.

4117
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:38,480
It'll probably be fine.

4118
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:39,590
They'll probably just let it,

4119
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,910
you know with a guy like that,

4120
01:44:40,911 --> 01:44:42,610
like what?

4121
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:43,520
You know,

4122
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,570
how much does he know?

4123
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:48,300
How does it knows every day
alive because it's good the,

4124
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,220
he's not going to say anything.

4125
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:51,673
Not going to talk.

4126
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:54,100
I wouldn't trust him if he,

4127
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,420
I was on that plane.

4128
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:59,120
I think that's the other thing about see
the aversion of conspiracies as you go.

4129
01:44:59,121 --> 01:45:00,560
Like nobody would,

4130
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:01,790
people would talk.

4131
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:05,750
The reality is people wouldn't talk
if you were from a prominent family.

4132
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:08,180
If it had been like a
religion to stay silent.

4133
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:10,640
If you had had CIA training,

4134
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,570
if you would,

4135
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:15,580
these people don't talk and we know that
there been plots that have gone unknown

4136
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:16,480
for a very long time.

4137
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:17,660
Clearly coup in Iran.

4138
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,140
Sure.

4139
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:18,590
So garlic,

4140
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:20,450
Jeffrey Epstein is so involved,

4141
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:21,583
so deep,

4142
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:22,790
he knows he'll get killed.

4143
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:24,050
He won't say anything.

4144
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:24,830
Yeah,

4145
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:25,760
he's not gonna say anything.

4146
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:27,440
Plus he doesn't want to go to jail.

4147
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,290
He just want to go to jail.

4148
01:45:28,290 --> 01:45:29,150
He doesn't want to say anything.

4149
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:30,260
Middle of the things that he did.

4150
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,393
Yeah.

4151
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:32,380
So the,

4152
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:32,531
the,

4153
01:45:32,531 --> 01:45:35,260
the child thing is the
creepiest of all gross.

4154
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:36,480
And unfortunately it's,

4155
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:37,370
it's a,

4156
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:38,420
it's a real thing.

4157
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:39,860
So you know,

4158
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:40,940
people you could talk about,

4159
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:43,640
there's the conspiratorial angles,

4160
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:44,330
the bullshit.

4161
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:46,010
But then there's the real fathers.

4162
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:46,853
Sandusky,

4163
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:48,630
Sandusky,

4164
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:48,660
Catholic Church,

4165
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:49,493
hundred percent.

4166
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:53,690
The people that are in love
with conspiracies never
care about private prisons

4167
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:54,831
or the Catholic Church.

4168
01:45:54,831 --> 01:45:55,101
And I'm like,

4169
01:45:55,101 --> 01:45:55,341
guys,

4170
01:45:55,341 --> 01:45:56,390
this is not even debatable.

4171
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,583
We're not even debating,

4172
01:45:57,630 --> 01:45:58,100
right.

4173
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,090
Private prisons are ruined.

4174
01:45:59,150 --> 01:46:01,400
Kids are being sold into slavery.

4175
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:02,061
Ryan Ababa,

4176
01:46:02,061 --> 01:46:02,420
horrible.

4177
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:04,070
The judge in Pennsylvania.

4178
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:04,790
Crazy.

4179
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:09,320
Taking an underage kids and just giving
them sentence ridiculous sentences for

4180
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:09,680
shit.

4181
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,241
That's crazy.

4182
01:46:10,241 --> 01:46:11,150
Exchange for money.

4183
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:12,140
That's not right.

4184
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:12,973
And now he's in jail.

4185
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:13,581
Yeah,

4186
01:46:13,581 --> 01:46:14,300
it's uh,

4187
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,010
there's some darkness in the world.

4188
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,180
It's undeniable.

4189
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,070
And when something like San Dusky,

4190
01:46:19,071 --> 01:46:21,710
when that Penn state thing
comes out and you're like,

4191
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:22,131
wait a minute,

4192
01:46:22,131 --> 01:46:23,630
how long was this going on for?

4193
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:25,150
And how many people knew?

4194
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,000
Everyone knew.

4195
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,350
How does everyone know?

4196
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:28,340
Yeah,

4197
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:28,850
it's crazy.

4198
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:30,860
It turned out just he died quick,

4199
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:35,690
but this is what I'm course
but doesn't mean he destroyed.

4200
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:39,230
This is what I mean about people where
it's like you tube's gonna like central

4201
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:40,490
conspiracy theory type stuff.

4202
01:46:40,491 --> 01:46:40,731
I'm like,

4203
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:43,670
all of those things would have been
called conspiracy theories at one point.

4204
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:44,953
Catholic church,

4205
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:46,830
San Dusky blue grade,

4206
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:48,230
they said it was a few bad apples.

4207
01:46:48,231 --> 01:46:49,064
It was a labyrinth.

4208
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:50,040
Torture prisoners.

4209
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,750
It was a program designed by the Pentagon.

4210
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:52,291
CIA.

4211
01:46:52,291 --> 01:46:52,950
It's crazy.

4212
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:55,290
What is the youtube going to do?

4213
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:57,630
They're going to censor recommending.

4214
01:46:57,631 --> 01:47:01,260
I think they were stopped recommending
conspiracy videos from what I've heard.

4215
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,810
But I was reading that thing that
you were telling me about Jamie,

4216
01:47:03,811 --> 01:47:08,811
this whole like porn or child
porn or pedophile network,

4217
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:11,490
you're sending an account of what is this?

4218
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:12,301
A pedophile youtube,

4219
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:14,340
what's going to a communication network.

4220
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:17,820
They were communicating with each other
and youtube comments responded yesterday

4221
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:19,800
and they said that they uh,

4222
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:25,100
disabled comments on tens of millions
of videos and deleted a lot of accounts

4223
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:29,363
that were,

4224
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:33,420
they were communicating in the
comment section of like a little kid's

4225
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:34,500
cheerleading and whatnot.

4226
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:39,710
How were they communicating to try to
s to share child porn or were they a

4227
01:47:40,021 --> 01:47:41,700
communicating to molest?

4228
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:44,850
Don't know in the way pedophiles
communicate and their network.

4229
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:45,683
But

4230
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:48,920
I'd like you to do a little bit more work.

4231
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:51,840
Pull up an article on due
diligence on the pedophile.

4232
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:57,190
I want you to go and eat under the dark
web burner computer for that download

4233
01:47:57,210 --> 01:48:00,180
tor and let's get moving cause
we got to figure shit out.

4234
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:04,650
You got to get a VPN or there that's the
FBI will take over child points had on

4235
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:06,660
tour and then Ronnie
for a year on the talk.

4236
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:08,043
What is that?

4237
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:09,360
What's going on.

4238
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:11,350
I imagine what they see too.

4239
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:13,950
That's a problem.

4240
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,500
It is a problem because you're causing,

4241
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,240
that happens at our Kelly Case.

4242
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:21,780
There's a video of him doing something
with an underage girl and like I think

4243
01:48:21,781 --> 01:48:22,890
some people at CNN,

4244
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:24,450
it's like we've seen it but,

4245
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:25,920
and that's led to him going and it's like,

4246
01:48:25,921 --> 01:48:28,860
well what did you watch and is that legal?

4247
01:48:28,861 --> 01:48:31,440
Probably illegal because you're
watching it under the guise of Oh,

4248
01:48:31,450 --> 01:48:32,283
journey out of

4249
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:36,563
rough.

4250
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,050
Yeah.

4251
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:39,210
That kind of Shit is real.

4252
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:44,690
And the fact that there's these
networks of people that are trying to,

4253
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:46,200
you know,

4254
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,090
cultivate these experiences.

4255
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:48,990
It's crazy man.

4256
01:48:48,991 --> 01:48:50,100
But if you're a rich person,

4257
01:48:50,101 --> 01:48:51,810
you have that sick predilection,

4258
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:54,660
you're going to find a way to
think of what they're doing.

4259
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:56,310
Like for example,

4260
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:59,850
the post her remarks that praise the
girls ask whether they were wearing

4261
01:48:59,851 --> 01:49:03,420
underwear or simply carried a string
of sexually suggestive emojis.

4262
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:04,531
Bout two years ago,

4263
01:49:04,531 --> 01:49:08,550
hundreds of companies pulled money from
Youtube over concerns about ads showing

4264
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:13,320
up next to problematic content from
terror or hate groups and videos a seem to

4265
01:49:13,321 --> 01:49:14,790
endanger exploit children.

4266
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:15,541
I think,

4267
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:16,080
you know,

4268
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,750
we've talked about this
before with youtube with the
issues that we've had with

4269
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:19,050
them.

4270
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:19,550
They,

4271
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:24,360
they have way too much content
and way too few people.

4272
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:26,460
There's no way they can watch all of it.

4273
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:29,220
And when Shit like this where people
were doing things in the comments,

4274
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:31,170
it's almost impossible to check.

4275
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:31,710
Yeah.

4276
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:32,543
I mean it's just,

4277
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:37,780
cause they're youtube comments are one
of the rare free range sort of like

4278
01:49:37,890 --> 01:49:41,130
unchecked message boards in the world.

4279
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,330
I'm sure I'll find out later.

4280
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:44,593
Read it.

4281
01:49:44,790 --> 01:49:45,630
Don't read it Bro.

4282
01:49:45,631 --> 01:49:46,770
Who is this fat fuck?

4283
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,390
He's not even a black Valerie.

4284
01:49:48,391 --> 01:49:48,660
Yeah.

4285
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:49,493
Yeah.

4286
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:50,613
Why is he here?

4287
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:52,240
Who is that dope?

4288
01:49:52,241 --> 01:49:52,740
Read it.

4289
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:53,120
Yeah.

4290
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:53,620
Yeah,

4291
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,150
yeah.

4292
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:54,640
Um,

4293
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,940
I wonder if there's ever going to
be a time where that is impossible,

4294
01:49:57,941 --> 01:50:01,000
where like these child pedophile rings,

4295
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,790
they can figure out a way
to snuff all that out.

4296
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:04,431
I'm,

4297
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:05,710
I'm harder now than ever before.

4298
01:50:05,711 --> 01:50:06,480
I'm imagining.

4299
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:11,480
It's very tough and it's tough I think
because so few people want to believe

4300
01:50:12,431 --> 01:50:14,830
that it's a problem in the way that it is,

4301
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:15,280
right?

4302
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,950
Because there's good people in the
world that don't think these things are

4303
01:50:17,951 --> 01:50:18,784
issues.

4304
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:22,510
So I think there's the political will
isn't there because people don't,

4305
01:50:22,511 --> 01:50:24,010
aren't really,

4306
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:25,240
they don't understand that it's,

4307
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:25,871
you know,

4308
01:50:25,871 --> 01:50:28,600
and then the people that are doing
these things are very wealthy,

4309
01:50:28,601 --> 01:50:29,381
powerful people,

4310
01:50:29,381 --> 01:50:32,140
and they have a lot of control and
they can kind of cover their tracks.

4311
01:50:32,141 --> 01:50:34,450
If they're were all
wealthy on all empower,

4312
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,440
poor pedophile,

4313
01:50:35,441 --> 01:50:36,760
you're not going to a ring.

4314
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:37,540
What are you doing?

4315
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:39,040
You snatching some kid,

4316
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:39,670
oh,

4317
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:40,690
I know it's bad.

4318
01:50:40,691 --> 01:50:41,321
But if you're rich,

4319
01:50:41,321 --> 01:50:42,040
pedophile,

4320
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:43,150
it's a nicer experience.

4321
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,490
It's like you go on vacation
versus me going on vacation,

4322
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,140
you go on vacation.

4323
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:47,951
It's a nice experience.

4324
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:48,970
I go on vacation,

4325
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:49,750
you know,

4326
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,501
it's fine.

4327
01:50:50,501 --> 01:50:52,240
Sandals in The Bahamas,

4328
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:57,250
not even no sales where you go in
the cabin or something in the forest.

4329
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:02,770
You know what's crazy about all of us
when you're talking about like child

4330
01:51:02,771 --> 01:51:03,790
molesters and stuff like that,

4331
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:08,820
which crazy is the Catholic church is
still around and still they're catching

4332
01:51:10,301 --> 01:51:12,730
people left and right
when it's known for it.

4333
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:14,170
There's no more,

4334
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:14,880
no,

4335
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,530
nothing is more synonymous
with child molesting.

4336
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:19,180
Then the Catholic church.

4337
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,260
That is the number one thing.

4338
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,670
You were raised Catholic.

4339
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:22,451
I was raised Catholic.

4340
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:23,201
I was never molested.

4341
01:51:23,201 --> 01:51:24,370
I was raised Catholic.

4342
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:24,930
Um,

4343
01:51:24,930 --> 01:51:25,451
you got lucky,

4344
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:25,900
Huh?

4345
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:26,530
I was lucky.

4346
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:28,030
I was fake chem labs Kat.

4347
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,811
We're all fit.

4348
01:51:28,811 --> 01:51:30,550
This Catholic is fake.

4349
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:31,750
It's,

4350
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:33,070
it's stuffed shells.

4351
01:51:33,071 --> 01:51:34,390
It's a nice dinner.

4352
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,520
It's five fishes once a year.

4353
01:51:36,521 --> 01:51:38,260
It's like no one cares.

4354
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:40,210
No one in a Catholic church cares.

4355
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,100
If you turn around to the
guy next to you though,

4356
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,121
is this bull shit.

4357
01:51:43,121 --> 01:51:43,850
They'll go shut up.

4358
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:44,920
I said I'm a bit about it.

4359
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,800
I don't understand the suicide
bombers cause I was raised Catholic.

4360
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:48,280
Right.

4361
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:52,540
And no one is in the Catholic
Church believes in it that much.

4362
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,920
We like nice buildings,

4363
01:51:53,921 --> 01:51:54,970
Catholic suicide bombers,

4364
01:51:54,971 --> 01:51:55,271
and be like,

4365
01:51:55,271 --> 01:51:55,920
you go first.

4366
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:56,040
Yeah.

4367
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:56,471
You go for,

4368
01:51:56,471 --> 01:51:57,304
I'll be over here.

4369
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:58,481
Do it together.

4370
01:51:58,481 --> 01:51:58,871
Ready,

4371
01:51:58,871 --> 01:51:59,261
set,

4372
01:51:59,261 --> 01:51:59,650
go.

4373
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:00,370
Are you still here?

4374
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:00,940
Yeah,

4375
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:01,601
it's our flux.

4376
01:52:01,601 --> 01:52:02,620
Nice architecture.

4377
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:03,280
It's beautiful.

4378
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:03,761
It's great.

4379
01:52:03,761 --> 01:52:04,460
It's nice.

4380
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:05,970
It's fun.

4381
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:07,390
I don't know what's going on in them.

4382
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,280
There's incense going around.

4383
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:11,720
This is the mystery of faith.

4384
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:12,370
Oh good.

4385
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:16,240
I was talking with Bob about this recently
about church has some good qualities

4386
01:52:16,241 --> 01:52:18,790
and one of the things that it
has is it makes you feel like,

4387
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:19,450
you know,

4388
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:20,770
it's like a community thing.

4389
01:52:20,771 --> 01:52:25,080
You sit down and you get a chance to
assess yourself and your life and sort of

4390
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:28,240
reaffirm your moral guidance
in your moral compass.

4391
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:28,720
And there's some,

4392
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,553
there's some,

4393
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:33,700
there's some positive things to a good
church and that's how those rock and roll

4394
01:52:33,701 --> 01:52:37,240
culty Super Hollywood churches
get started because people say,

4395
01:52:37,241 --> 01:52:38,170
I want a church.

4396
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:40,120
I just don't want a traditional church.

4397
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:42,710
I want something spiritual
and funds and killing.

4398
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:43,810
It's not like the church.

4399
01:52:43,811 --> 01:52:44,321
When I grew up,

4400
01:52:44,321 --> 01:52:44,891
I said to my dad,

4401
01:52:44,891 --> 01:52:45,940
why do we go here every Sunday?

4402
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,191
He went,

4403
01:52:46,191 --> 01:52:47,024
shut up.

4404
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:48,830
That was the answer because it was like,

4405
01:52:48,831 --> 01:52:49,520
we just go,

4406
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:49,881
you go,

4407
01:52:49,881 --> 01:52:52,040
you guys don't want your mom to get mad.

4408
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:54,380
But people in Hollywood
and people that they,

4409
01:52:54,381 --> 01:52:55,670
you know want the hip work,

4410
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:56,690
they want to be drawn to it.

4411
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:57,860
They want it to speak to them.

4412
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:58,101
Yeah.

4413
01:52:58,101 --> 01:53:01,610
They played rock and roll
music and religions call.

4414
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,390
My soul is,

4415
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:03,223
you know,

4416
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:03,831
and it's,

4417
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:04,101
you know,

4418
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:05,080
it's just a lot of horse shit.

4419
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:06,153
It is shit.

4420
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:07,640
It makes them feel good.

4421
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,241
Yeah.

4422
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:12,120
My Buddy's a assistant and a buddy of
mine who was his assistant was going to

4423
01:53:12,121 --> 01:53:12,631
one of those church.

4424
01:53:12,631 --> 01:53:15,860
She was a NYMPHOMANIAC and she was
trying to stop fucking everybody,

4425
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:16,873
so she started going

4426
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,000
to church.

4427
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,990
What church is that?

4428
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:22,330
The Stop fucking around church.

4429
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,010
She'll just start fucking get spiritual.

4430
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:25,371
She's like,

4431
01:53:25,371 --> 01:53:26,300
I'm going to be celibate.

4432
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:26,570
I'm like,

4433
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:26,930
Eh,

4434
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:27,540
whatever.

4435
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:27,800
Yeah.

4436
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,760
She was one of those gals.

4437
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:31,100
She'd just have a couple of
pops and then off to the races.

4438
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,761
Listen,

4439
01:53:31,761 --> 01:53:32,840
you live lunch,

4440
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:33,561
you live.

4441
01:53:33,561 --> 01:53:34,570
Once she was on,

4442
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,451
she was attractive.

4443
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:36,410
She was having a good time.

4444
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:36,830
Yeah.

4445
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:37,730
I don't see the problem.

4446
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,820
What church did she go to?

4447
01:53:38,821 --> 01:53:39,531
This one of them cracked.

4448
01:53:39,531 --> 01:53:39,860
I Dunno,

4449
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:41,150
this is decades ago,

4450
01:53:41,151 --> 01:53:41,750
but it was one of them.

4451
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:43,340
Crazy rock and roll type churches.

4452
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:43,460
Oh,

4453
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:44,150
that's so funny.

4454
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:45,590
You know the Catholic I,

4455
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:48,320
I think it's interesting that people
that joined the Catholic religion now,

4456
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:48,651
oh,

4457
01:53:48,651 --> 01:53:49,484
that's ridiculous.

4458
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:50,870
Who's joining it now?

4459
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:51,410
Yeah.

4460
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:52,460
Who's going in and going,

4461
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:53,323
you know what?

4462
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:54,020
I enjoy it.

4463
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:54,853
I don't know who did it.

4464
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,010
You know Glenn Beck joined
the Mormons as a grown man.

4465
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:58,251
Well,

4466
01:53:58,251 --> 01:53:59,084
that makes sense.

4467
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:00,500
That makes sense.

4468
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,410
Yeah.

4469
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:02,240
It's a little off.

4470
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,410
Maybe one the nine whys.

4471
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:03,861
Yeah.

4472
01:54:03,861 --> 01:54:05,400
It's probably why you're
sort of course did.

4473
01:54:05,401 --> 01:54:06,650
So it's a huge benefit.

4474
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,281
Do you know the,

4475
01:54:07,281 --> 01:54:08,510
the whole Mitt Romney store?

4476
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,440
No.

4477
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,070
You don't know?

4478
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:10,670
I don't know.

4479
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:14,900
So I have my cousin married a Mormon
who they excommunicated from the church

4480
01:54:14,901 --> 01:54:19,250
when he was like 17 Mitt Romney's
family all moved to Mexico.

4481
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:23,210
That's why Mitt Romney's dad could never
be president because meant Romney's dad

4482
01:54:23,211 --> 01:54:27,800
was born in Mexico because when they
passed the law making polygamy illegal in

4483
01:54:27,801 --> 01:54:28,850
the United States,

4484
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:31,730
they all packed up their
shit and went to Mexico.

4485
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:32,151
Really?

4486
01:54:32,151 --> 01:54:32,481
Yes.

4487
01:54:32,481 --> 01:54:35,930
Because in the 18 hundreds
it didn't fucking matter if
you were in Mexico or the

4488
01:54:35,931 --> 01:54:36,501
United States,

4489
01:54:36,501 --> 01:54:37,161
it was all the same.

4490
01:54:37,161 --> 01:54:38,430
You're riding a horse everywhere.

4491
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:39,590
Fuck.

4492
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:41,150
They're like that could
have nine wives over here.

4493
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:42,410
So they have these compounds.

4494
01:54:42,411 --> 01:54:43,610
Vice did a whole series.

4495
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:46,420
Now they have compounds down
there with the armed guards.

4496
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:46,641
Yeah,

4497
01:54:46,641 --> 01:54:49,250
because the cartel was fucking
kidnapping them and shit.

4498
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:50,001
Interesting.

4499
01:54:50,001 --> 01:54:51,230
So Mitt Romney's dad was like,

4500
01:54:51,231 --> 01:54:53,430
you can't take nice fucking guys.

4501
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:55,460
They still have a fucking,

4502
01:54:55,461 --> 01:54:59,390
they still have a compound down
there in the Smithsonian magazine,

4503
01:54:59,770 --> 01:55:02,780
but is that the smithsonian.com
au has a story on it?

4504
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,833
Yeah,

4505
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:05,600
the Romney's Mexican history.

4506
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:06,290
Yeah,

4507
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:07,550
the whole family.

4508
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:08,990
That's what I meant from Mexico.

4509
01:55:08,991 --> 01:55:09,470
Amazing.

4510
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:10,191
Amazing.

4511
01:55:10,191 --> 01:55:10,851
That's amazing.

4512
01:55:10,851 --> 01:55:11,610
It's amazing.

4513
01:55:11,610 --> 01:55:12,443
They,

4514
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:17,210
I know they went down there because they
couldn't do what they wanted to do in

4515
01:55:17,211 --> 01:55:17,811
the United States.

4516
01:55:17,811 --> 01:55:19,520
There was no polygamy in the u s anymore.

4517
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:19,850
Anyone?

4518
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:20,250
No,

4519
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:21,300
that's legal interest.

4520
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:22,143
It's just hilarious.

4521
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,311
Yeah.

4522
01:55:22,311 --> 01:55:22,850
Let it happen.

4523
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:24,470
Because here's the thing,

4524
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,350
you could have like nine girlfriends.

4525
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:26,600
Sure.

4526
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,460
And I'll live together
and no one could say shit,

4527
01:55:28,461 --> 01:55:29,660
but as soon as you write it down,

4528
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:31,610
it's a prop you up and put you in jail.

4529
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,710
There was a show called like
sister wives or something.

4530
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:35,030
It was about people that,

4531
01:55:35,031 --> 01:55:37,550
I think they were living in the
state and then like multiple wives.

4532
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:38,420
Was it?

4533
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,170
Yeah,

4534
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,040
it's probably bullshit.

4535
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:40,701
Okay.

4536
01:55:40,701 --> 01:55:42,470
I don't think polygamy Google it.

4537
01:55:42,471 --> 01:55:43,830
Maybe it's like legal in like

4538
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,270
Nebraska or some shit.

4539
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:46,373
Sorry Nebraska.

4540
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:47,221
I liked it.

4541
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:48,930
Then Brasco would be just a place to go.

4542
01:55:48,931 --> 01:55:49,590
You know what?

4543
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:51,390
Let live and let live live and let live.

4544
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:52,410
Live Rask is like,

4545
01:55:52,411 --> 01:55:55,170
we're having a hard time keeping people
here so you can just fuck anything.

4546
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:56,460
Anyone you want Mary,

4547
01:55:56,461 --> 01:55:57,001
your dog,

4548
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:57,301
Mary,

4549
01:55:57,301 --> 01:55:59,370
everything is polygamy nationwide,

4550
01:55:59,371 --> 01:56:00,630
federally illegal.

4551
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:02,581
It is illegal.

4552
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:05,250
But I know what you're talking about
where there is TV shows where people are

4553
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:06,180
still doing it.

4554
01:56:06,181 --> 01:56:11,181
So also have you successfully infiltrated
a pedophile youtube group yet waiting

4555
01:56:11,341 --> 01:56:11,781
for the tweet.

4556
01:56:11,781 --> 01:56:12,630
So Lazy.

4557
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:16,680
But it is crazy that his family was like,

4558
01:56:16,681 --> 01:56:17,191
well fuck it.

4559
01:56:17,191 --> 01:56:19,500
We'll just move to Mexico
and he made a great point.

4560
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:20,221
It's the same thing.

4561
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:21,480
You're on a horse back then.

4562
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:21,661
Yes.

4563
01:56:21,661 --> 01:56:22,470
To Rio Grande.

4564
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:22,681
Yeah,

4565
01:56:22,681 --> 01:56:26,700
because I think when they made it illegal
in the 18 hundreds look at us as a

4566
01:56:26,701 --> 01:56:28,500
polygamous community crumbles.

4567
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,101
Sister.

4568
01:56:29,101 --> 01:56:30,720
Wives are forced from homes.

4569
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:31,980
This is the caliber of life.

4570
01:56:31,981 --> 01:56:32,641
This is interesting.

4571
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:33,480
Saw you get bro.

4572
01:56:33,481 --> 01:56:34,420
If you want nine of them,

4573
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:35,540
you don't get nine good ones.

4574
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:37,620
You need to get one 10 or not in ones.

4575
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:38,970
This is a lot of,

4576
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:40,060
you know this is,

4577
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:41,950
you don't think of nine shitty wives.

4578
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:42,510
No,

4579
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:44,280
you don't think of nine horrible wives,

4580
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:46,110
but the thing is you
could have those wives.

4581
01:56:46,111 --> 01:56:48,150
You just can't have them legally let you.

4582
01:56:48,151 --> 01:56:49,770
They can't be legally your wife,

4583
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:53,580
but you could do like a whole
like roots jump over the broom.

4584
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:54,420
You know you could,

4585
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,160
you could.

4586
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:57,600
You can make your own ceremony.

4587
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:59,970
Of course he just can't
register in the courthouse,

4588
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,650
which is hilarious to me.

4589
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:03,850
Like who the fuck are you
to tell someone that can,

4590
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:04,250
all right.

4591
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:06,120
How about a woman that has five husbands?

4592
01:57:06,121 --> 01:57:06,840
Can we do that?

4593
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:07,591
Yeah,

4594
01:57:07,591 --> 01:57:08,430
you go girl.

4595
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:09,330
Power.

4596
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:10,560
Power for ground for it.

4597
01:57:10,561 --> 01:57:11,370
I'm for polygamy.

4598
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:11,880
Me Too.

4599
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,290
I want to come out short on this show.

4600
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:14,850
Five cucs and one woman.

4601
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,591
Who Cares?

4602
01:57:15,591 --> 01:57:18,960
I'll sit around stroking their half
our dicks waiting their turn crying.

4603
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,430
Perfect.

4604
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:23,760
That is a perfect
representation of 2019 America.

4605
01:57:23,790 --> 01:57:24,840
Who would vote that out?

4606
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:26,670
Who would say no to sick people?

4607
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,750
Someone was a communist.

4608
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:30,840
We need more people getting the
youtube pedophile cults out.

4609
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:31,410
Yes.

4610
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:32,530
And putting the polygamous sin.

4611
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:33,840
We need priorities.

4612
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:38,930
I feel like if you want to marry a guy
with 18 year friends who gives a shit.

4613
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:40,440
Yeah.

4614
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,480
I guess the problem is the divorce.

4615
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:43,650
Yeah.

4616
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:45,270
Isn't that the issue of money for you?

4617
01:57:45,271 --> 01:57:46,104
Sorry,

4618
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,880
I'm splitting it up 18 ways.

4619
01:57:47,881 --> 01:57:48,750
You're not going to get a lot,

4620
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:49,021
right?

4621
01:57:49,021 --> 01:57:50,490
Anyone with 18 of anything?

4622
01:57:50,491 --> 01:57:51,530
Unless you're like assaulting,

4623
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:53,010
you probably don't have a ton anyway.

4624
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:54,360
Unless you Jeff Bezos.

4625
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:55,490
Yeah.

4626
01:57:55,490 --> 01:57:56,640
Well that was a kid.

4627
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:59,370
He could marry a hundred chicks
and give them all a billion.

4628
01:57:59,410 --> 01:57:59,721
Gotcha.

4629
01:57:59,721 --> 01:58:01,770
How sill that 50 leftover.

4630
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:02,580
What?

4631
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:02,761
Yeah,

4632
01:58:02,761 --> 01:58:03,594
he's doing good.

4633
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:04,703
He's doing good.

4634
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:06,360
But that whole thing with him,

4635
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:07,830
that was an interesting thing.

4636
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,670
The uh,

4637
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:11,940
the pictures being leaked and it turns
out it's the brother that leaked the

4638
01:58:11,941 --> 01:58:12,660
pictures.

4639
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,010
I love the brother immediately.

4640
01:58:14,011 --> 01:58:15,120
As soon as I read the article,

4641
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:15,571
because I'm like,

4642
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:16,820
this is Trump supporter.

4643
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,330
Not only is your Trump supporter,

4644
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:21,990
this is a guy who tried to
leverage himself forever
and he found out his history

4645
01:58:21,991 --> 01:58:22,980
was fucking Jeff Bezos.

4646
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:24,720
Can you imagine the
night he found that out?

4647
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:26,340
The night he found that out.

4648
01:58:26,341 --> 01:58:27,180
Where was he?

4649
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,650
What was he doing?

4650
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:30,870
He was somewhere thinking,

4651
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:31,853
this is it.

4652
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:33,181
She's fucked.

4653
01:58:33,181 --> 01:58:35,670
A lot of people that are good now.

4654
01:58:35,671 --> 01:58:36,810
She's fucking basis now.

4655
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:39,240
Some cash in now it's time
to think of something good.

4656
01:58:39,241 --> 01:58:40,074
How do we do it?

4657
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,590
This is a plot guy.

4658
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:42,603
Yeah.

4659
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,620
I wonder what the enquirer gave him.

4660
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:46,630
How much money you get
for something like that?

4661
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:47,650
Half a mil.

4662
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:48,550
Bayzos Dick.

4663
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,420
I want more.

4664
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:50,410
I want a solid mill.

4665
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:51,401
Solid male.

4666
01:58:51,401 --> 01:58:52,630
You think your life,

4667
01:58:52,631 --> 01:58:53,464
he's going to kill you.

4668
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,633
You think he will?

4669
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:55,751
If he doesn't,

4670
01:58:55,751 --> 01:58:56,531
I'll be disappointed.

4671
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:57,364
It's a good point.

4672
01:58:57,530 --> 01:58:58,600
Make it look like an accident.

4673
01:58:58,601 --> 01:58:59,470
If you're a fucking,

4674
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:00,723
you know

4675
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:02,710
he's,

4676
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:04,630
he's like daddy Warbucks.

4677
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:05,110
Yeah,

4678
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:05,860
he's the guy.

4679
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:06,693
He's the guy.

4680
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,290
He's got a hundred automated,

4681
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:13,420
automated everything and Amazon's
like notoriously like he's an alien.

4682
01:59:13,421 --> 01:59:15,100
He looks like he's
artificial intelligence.

4683
01:59:15,101 --> 01:59:15,790
He's Ai.

4684
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,120
Yeah.

4685
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:17,110
He has that look already.

4686
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,480
He's super smart and he's
going to play it real slow.

4687
01:59:19,510 --> 01:59:19,661
Yeah.

4688
01:59:19,661 --> 01:59:21,190
Helen's slave the world and you know what?

4689
01:59:21,191 --> 01:59:21,550
Let him,

4690
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:24,970
he's probably going to hire somebody
to fuck up that guy's life slowly.

4691
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,140
I'm sure he already has.

4692
01:59:26,190 --> 01:59:26,650
Yeah,

4693
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:27,483
we'll slow.

4694
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:28,780
This is your new job.

4695
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:33,190
Your new job is to slowly make
that guys lodash everything.

4696
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:33,921
Everything.

4697
01:59:33,921 --> 01:59:35,260
Flat tires every day.

4698
01:59:35,290 --> 01:59:35,431
Yeah,

4699
01:59:35,431 --> 01:59:35,581
yeah,

4700
01:59:35,581 --> 01:59:36,030
yeah,

4701
01:59:36,030 --> 01:59:36,863
yeah.

4702
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:43,750
I love the henchman that's going
at nailing flat tires set up.

4703
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:45,550
He's going to check for cameras.

4704
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:46,713
That's amazing.

4705
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:46,991
Yeah.

4706
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:47,290
The paint,

4707
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:49,860
the base says those are the new type.

4708
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:51,730
Like cause I studied a lot
about like Rockefeller,

4709
01:59:51,731 --> 01:59:52,121
Carnegie,

4710
01:59:52,121 --> 01:59:53,680
guys like that and those guys,

4711
01:59:53,681 --> 01:59:54,121
nobody's,

4712
01:59:54,121 --> 01:59:55,480
he amassed a fortune of those guys.

4713
01:59:55,481 --> 01:59:59,020
Had Rockefeller at like 336
billion in today's dollars.

4714
01:59:59,530 --> 02:00:02,020
Laura Carnegie at 372 billion.

4715
02:00:02,021 --> 02:00:02,650
I mean these,

4716
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:03,460
these were the first,

4717
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:04,720
how much did they have in their time?

4718
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:06,010
Ah,

4719
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:07,420
cause the questions and their time,

4720
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:08,231
I don't know,

4721
02:00:08,231 --> 02:00:08,561
but in,

4722
02:00:08,561 --> 02:00:09,760
in it was millions.

4723
02:00:09,761 --> 02:00:10,630
Well I don't think it was billions,

4724
02:00:10,631 --> 02:00:11,800
but in our time it's about,

4725
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,240
it's the over 300 million.

4726
02:00:13,241 --> 02:00:13,780
Both of them.

4727
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:15,740
These were the first generation of B,

4728
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:16,750
B.

4729
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,080
B.

4730
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:19,060
This was the first
generation of Robert Bat.

4731
02:00:19,061 --> 02:00:21,400
Like the first generation
of entrepreneurs,

4732
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:21,911
you know,

4733
02:00:21,911 --> 02:00:22,960
the country was new,

4734
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:25,780
all of these industries would just
emerging and these guys took it over.

4735
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:28,270
Bayzos tech is,

4736
02:00:28,271 --> 02:00:28,811
and somebody said,

4737
02:00:28,811 --> 02:00:29,770
it's on my podcast recently.

4738
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:33,610
Tech is the closest thing we have
now to that where you have these,

4739
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:34,630
you know,

4740
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:37,360
masters of the universe
that are going to be,

4741
02:00:37,361 --> 02:00:38,350
I mean those guys would be,

4742
02:00:38,351 --> 02:00:40,030
JP Morgan was like bailing
the government out.

4743
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,220
These guys had an insane amount of power.

4744
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:43,180
Um,

4745
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:44,013
they what's really,

4746
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:45,310
really interesting figures.

4747
02:00:45,311 --> 02:00:45,460
Yeah.

4748
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:46,210
I was just,

4749
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:47,350
when I told you I was doing this,

4750
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:52,090
chariots of the gods lunch today with a
bunch of very influential people and one

4751
02:00:52,091 --> 02:00:52,661
of them said,

4752
02:00:52,661 --> 02:00:57,661
it's really ironic that apple used to be
think different and that was the whole

4753
02:00:57,671 --> 02:00:59,890
thing about silicon valley.

4754
02:00:59,891 --> 02:01:01,120
Think different now.

4755
02:01:01,121 --> 02:01:03,700
It's don't think different right now.

4756
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:06,670
Now let's streamline everybody
into one acceptable thing.

4757
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:06,941
Yeah.

4758
02:01:06,941 --> 02:01:11,770
Now it's literally you have to think
the way everyone else is thinking.

4759
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:13,720
You have to believe what
everyone else believes,

4760
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:15,130
even if it's ridiculous.

4761
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:17,950
I think a lot of that is they want to
just make money and sell things and they

4762
02:01:17,951 --> 02:01:19,210
don't want any discord.

4763
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:20,440
They just want to sell,

4764
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:21,250
make money,

4765
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:22,001
sort of.

4766
02:01:22,001 --> 02:01:23,070
But it seems like,

4767
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:24,071
I don't think,

4768
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:26,930
cause they don't band people after they
do the things they banned him after

4769
02:01:26,931 --> 02:01:28,030
there's a public outcry.

4770
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:29,500
So to me they're not,

4771
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:31,240
they don't have any real values.

4772
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:36,050
Their values are tangible and the values
are influenced by public opinion and

4773
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:37,240
where media is.

4774
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:40,130
The values aren't like when somebody says

4775
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,610
something,

4776
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:42,590
let's ban him right now
this goes against our thing.

4777
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:46,340
A lot of it is if you wait until
there's enough dust kicked up,

4778
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:47,600
then they will ban somebody.

4779
02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:48,290
Right.

4780
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:49,010
That's true.

4781
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:49,843
So to me,

4782
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:52,370
I get in arguments with friends when
they were like their ideological,

4783
02:01:52,371 --> 02:01:54,440
I'm like they have an
ideological bent certainly,

4784
02:01:55,190 --> 02:01:59,300
but their profit seeking enterprises
that just want everyone to be happy.

4785
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:00,620
I think if it was up to Twitter,

4786
02:02:00,621 --> 02:02:02,600
every tweet would be
some type of branded ad.

4787
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:04,130
And on top of that,

4788
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:09,160
now the ideology is skewing and leaning
in that direction in terms of like tech

4789
02:02:09,801 --> 02:02:10,730
and sure,

4790
02:02:10,731 --> 02:02:11,690
there's money in that.

4791
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:15,590
There's money in holding that line and
those guys are the ones that are as

4792
02:02:15,591 --> 02:02:19,300
powerful as Rockefeller
and Carnegie and JP.

4793
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:20,450
Like all of those guys,

4794
02:02:20,451 --> 02:02:24,800
they are the next generation
of people who will,

4795
02:02:24,801 --> 02:02:28,170
their amount of powers is unmatched
anywhere in society they're,

4796
02:02:28,171 --> 02:02:28,880
they're getting,

4797
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,890
they're branching out more and more.

4798
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:32,490
Like the Amazon is now going to have a,

4799
02:02:32,491 --> 02:02:33,590
an electric car.

4800
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:35,540
They're investing in that new,

4801
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:36,351
what's it called?

4802
02:02:36,351 --> 02:02:40,910
Rivan ravion some new electric
car company that's that uh,

4803
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:42,410
Bayzos is investing in.

4804
02:02:42,411 --> 02:02:44,420
They're investing in space travel.

4805
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:45,740
They're investing in all these different,

4806
02:02:45,741 --> 02:02:45,921
I mean,

4807
02:02:45,921 --> 02:02:49,730
he's not going to get poorer
and more and more rich.

4808
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:50,241
No,

4809
02:02:50,241 --> 02:02:51,530
he's gonna take over everything.

4810
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:51,861
I mean,

4811
02:02:51,861 --> 02:02:52,870
these luck we have,

4812
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:53,900
you cannot doubt,

4813
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:56,120
you can't opt out of these systems.

4814
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:58,850
You have to be involved
to live a normal life.

4815
02:02:59,090 --> 02:03:00,200
You have to be online.

4816
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:05,260
Did you see how someone
tried to use to go online,

4817
02:03:05,451 --> 02:03:07,010
live their life without Google?

4818
02:03:07,011 --> 02:03:07,910
Amazon,

4819
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:08,511
good luck.

4820
02:03:08,511 --> 02:03:09,470
A few other things.

4821
02:03:09,471 --> 02:03:11,300
And apple and they said
they couldn't do it.

4822
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:13,820
Now are you should fear is the only
one who can do it with a flip phone.

4823
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:14,810
He's barely doing it.

4824
02:03:14,811 --> 02:03:17,720
He's on his iPad using
his friend I messages.

4825
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:20,080
He messages me all the time,

4826
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,250
all the time,

4827
02:03:22,490 --> 02:03:23,323
pretend these.

4828
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:24,620
But I think I give them that.

4829
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:26,700
I'm impressed that he
still has a flip phone.

4830
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:27,673
Well he,

4831
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:30,140
he knows that he's an addict,

4832
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:30,680
you know,

4833
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:33,050
he knows and he's an honest man,

4834
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:33,891
you know,

4835
02:03:33,891 --> 02:03:34,341
and he's like,

4836
02:03:34,341 --> 02:03:35,180
fuck this,

4837
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:36,560
this is just too much of my life.

4838
02:03:36,561 --> 02:03:37,100
He's right.

4839
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,230
He'd be checking social
media constantly and,

4840
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:40,400
and also if you're,

4841
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:40,851
you know,

4842
02:03:40,851 --> 02:03:42,260
your controversial like he is,

4843
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:44,690
a lot of people are talking shit to him
and that would hurt his feelings and

4844
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:45,830
saying mean things to him.

4845
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:49,220
And social media has gotten to the point
where I'm on it all day and I'm like,

4846
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:50,360
I'm not having any fun.

4847
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:50,990
No.

4848
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:52,400
It's really gotten to the point where,

4849
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:53,690
what does this experience,

4850
02:03:53,870 --> 02:03:55,730
Facebook is a nightmare.

4851
02:03:55,731 --> 02:03:57,380
It's elderly people
screaming at each other.

4852
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,740
This was a website where kids were
trying to get laid in college.

4853
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,650
This is elderly people
screaming and complaining.

4854
02:04:03,651 --> 02:04:06,740
They can't afford knee operations
and I'm just going like this all day.

4855
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:07,730
Yeah,

4856
02:04:07,730 --> 02:04:08,510
it's,

4857
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:09,290
it's not,

4858
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:10,940
you don't get a lot of bang for your buck.

4859
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:14,030
I've dropped off radically
over the last six months.

4860
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:19,480
The last six months I've made a giant
giant shift away from a reading things and

4861
02:04:20,331 --> 02:04:21,620
posting things and just,

4862
02:04:21,621 --> 02:04:25,270
I like look at it and look for a couple
seconds and then I'll put it down on a

4863
02:04:25,271 --> 02:04:26,160
hope your post.

4864
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:26,910
Yeah.

4865
02:04:26,910 --> 02:04:27,311
Yeah.

4866
02:04:27,311 --> 02:04:28,190
I'm more engaged.

4867
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,510
I'm too fucking busy,

4868
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:29,950
you know.

4869
02:04:29,950 --> 02:04:32,810
And so what I'm trying to figure
out ways to better optimize my time.

4870
02:04:32,811 --> 02:04:33,760
That was one of the first ones.

4871
02:04:33,761 --> 02:04:34,670
Stopped reading comments,

4872
02:04:34,671 --> 02:04:35,840
stop reading posts,

4873
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:40,800
don't just it mindlessly c shift
through Instagram pictures,

4874
02:04:40,801 --> 02:04:42,690
looking for something that
strikes me as interesting.

4875
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:46,710
I just stopped doing that and it made
a big difference in my productivity.

4876
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:47,010
Yeah,

4877
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:47,720
huge difference.

4878
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:48,120
Yeah.

4879
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:48,840
Cause you know when the,

4880
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:51,600
when I phone real recently they started
putting that thing on your phone.

4881
02:04:51,601 --> 02:04:53,730
We see how much screen time you had.

4882
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:54,101
Oh yeah.

4883
02:04:54,101 --> 02:04:54,720
That's crazy.

4884
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,411
You look at it,

4885
02:04:55,411 --> 02:04:55,621
you're like,

4886
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:55,801
what?

4887
02:04:55,801 --> 02:04:56,610
Five hours?

4888
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:58,190
I now is 46 minutes.

4889
02:04:58,191 --> 02:04:59,610
That's five hours of nothing.

4890
02:04:59,750 --> 02:04:59,880
Yeah.

4891
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,600
What did I do?

4892
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:01,860
I get a little out of it.

4893
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:02,280
Right?

4894
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:04,800
I'll go find new stories
that can talk about,

4895
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:06,210
but it's like finding,

4896
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:11,040
I found that like finding the perfect
blend seems to be letting the stories get

4897
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:13,380
so big that they get to you anyway.

4898
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:14,490
No,

4899
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:17,460
I've got the fringe stories
to like the Jesse Small age.

4900
02:05:17,490 --> 02:05:19,500
It gets so big you can't hear about it.

4901
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:19,890
Yeah.

4902
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:20,491
And then you hear,

4903
02:05:20,491 --> 02:05:25,290
and I love the day that the day when
we all found out it was social media is

4904
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:28,710
great today that we all found out he was
full of shit because then anyone could

4905
02:05:28,711 --> 02:05:29,544
make jokes.

4906
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:30,810
But the three days before that,

4907
02:05:30,811 --> 02:05:31,710
everyone is posturing.

4908
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:32,270
Oh,

4909
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:33,600
so thought out.

4910
02:05:33,601 --> 02:05:33,900
Right.

4911
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,820
But then when it came out
that it was all bullshit,

4912
02:05:35,821 --> 02:05:36,630
everyone's like,

4913
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:36,781
oh,

4914
02:05:36,781 --> 02:05:37,950
let's just have fun.

4915
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:39,420
And even though it's,

4916
02:05:39,930 --> 02:05:40,410
you know,

4917
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:44,880
I'm not saying that people aren't
getting attacked and things aren't bad,

4918
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:46,470
but this particular thing,

4919
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:47,130
right.

4920
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:48,750
If you can't make a joke about this,

4921
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:50,310
what can you make a joke about?

4922
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:51,480
If you can't make a Joseph,

4923
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:53,730
if you think someone
shouldn't joke about this,

4924
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:54,450
fuck you.

4925
02:05:54,450 --> 02:05:55,080
Fuck you.

4926
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:55,650
Fuck you.

4927
02:05:55,650 --> 02:05:56,220
Absolutely.

4928
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:56,910
Absolutely.

4929
02:05:56,910 --> 02:05:57,290
Yeah.

4930
02:05:57,290 --> 02:05:57,421
Yeah.

4931
02:05:57,421 --> 02:06:00,510
This is one of those things
that it's fucking ridiculous.

4932
02:06:00,511 --> 02:06:01,260
Insane.

4933
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:03,450
Holding the subway with the fucking news.

4934
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,180
He pled not guilty in court.

4935
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:06,481
No,

4936
02:06:06,481 --> 02:06:06,810
he did.

4937
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:07,530
Yes he did.

4938
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:07,950
No,

4939
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:08,191
Jamie,

4940
02:06:08,191 --> 02:06:09,420
he pled not guilty on everything.

4941
02:06:09,421 --> 02:06:09,810
Right?

4942
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:10,860
He denied all charges.

4943
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:12,053
He

4944
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:14,280
denied all charges.

4945
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:16,020
He's going to take his own life.

4946
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:17,190
I believe they have the check.

4947
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:18,023
He wrote to them.

4948
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:20,460
Check 35 hunch.

4949
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:20,971
Ah,

4950
02:06:20,971 --> 02:06:21,990
he wrote a check already.

4951
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:23,850
$500 in cash.

4952
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:25,650
He wrote a check that she has.

4953
02:06:25,651 --> 02:06:28,140
The other thing I could get
punched in five minutes for free.

4954
02:06:29,610 --> 02:06:31,170
I could get beat up so easily.

4955
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:33,300
Why is this guy spending $3,500 well,

4956
02:06:33,301 --> 02:06:33,931
not only that,

4957
02:06:33,931 --> 02:06:35,010
why do you write a check?

4958
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:36,360
Do you have no friends?

4959
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:37,560
He just,

4960
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,350
he just didn't think this
through even a little bit.

4961
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,360
Yeah.

4962
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,210
God dammit.

4963
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:43,163
It's disappointing.

4964
02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:44,220
It's kind of funny though.

4965
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:46,140
There's nothing funnier right now.

4966
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:46,561
Well,

4967
02:06:46,561 --> 02:06:48,120
I think this is what we need.

4968
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:48,511
You know,

4969
02:06:48,511 --> 02:06:52,080
we need to understand the outrage machine
a little bit better and one of the

4970
02:06:52,081 --> 02:06:54,570
best ways to see it as
see manufactured outrage.

4971
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,121
Absolutely.

4972
02:06:55,121 --> 02:06:55,620
And then you go,

4973
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:57,120
oh okay this is a hustle.

4974
02:06:57,150 --> 02:07:00,870
Well the cup and thing was great because
people like wishing death on 15 year

4975
02:07:00,871 --> 02:07:04,260
old kids and it's like the video comes
out exonerates them and then people are

4976
02:07:04,261 --> 02:07:04,890
like,

4977
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:05,723
no.

4978
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:05,981
Yeah,

4979
02:07:05,981 --> 02:07:06,840
people were doubling down.

4980
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:08,960
People like you can't
deny what my eyes saw.

4981
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:09,230
I'm like,

4982
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:10,140
oh yo nuts.

4983
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:13,320
And then I was afraid cause I'm like
tweeting things that supported the kids.

4984
02:07:13,321 --> 02:07:13,920
But I'm like,

4985
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,030
what if the next video,

4986
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:19,540
it's just the kids in Klan outfits
like this and just dancing around with,

4987
02:07:19,541 --> 02:07:20,950
with torches like Charlottesville.

4988
02:07:20,951 --> 02:07:21,271
And I'm like,

4989
02:07:21,271 --> 02:07:22,650
well then now I look like an idiot.

4990
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:22,891
Yeah,

4991
02:07:22,891 --> 02:07:23,580
you can't,

4992
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:24,870
you don't know what to tell them.

4993
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,550
You're better off being an observer.

4994
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:27,061
Yeah,

4995
02:07:27,061 --> 02:07:28,860
just split it up into the fray.

4996
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:29,500
He just,

4997
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:31,260
you make little choke sit back.

4998
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:31,741
Yeah.

4999
02:07:31,741 --> 02:07:32,880
It's like a gang fight.

5000
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:35,070
You better upstairs
standing back and going,

5001
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:35,440
hmm,

5002
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,280
I don't want to jump in there.

5003
02:07:36,281 --> 02:07:36,641
And every,

5004
02:07:36,641 --> 02:07:37,361
every day,

5005
02:07:37,361 --> 02:07:38,081
every hour.

5006
02:07:38,081 --> 02:07:39,850
Another vantage point
of that thing was like,

5007
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:40,091
well,

5008
02:07:40,091 --> 02:07:40,271
no,

5009
02:07:40,271 --> 02:07:41,680
maybe they are guilty.

5010
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:42,280
Yeah.

5011
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:42,580
You know,

5012
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:43,241
I saw that thing.

5013
02:07:43,241 --> 02:07:44,500
It was like a white kid.

5014
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:44,981
I slept,

5015
02:07:44,981 --> 02:07:48,130
they encircled the native American
guy who was banging the drum.

5016
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:48,401
And I'm like,

5017
02:07:48,401 --> 02:07:49,234
fuck these kids.

5018
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:50,643
That's not good.

5019
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:52,030
When you see the first image and you know,

5020
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:52,661
the first image,

5021
02:07:52,661 --> 02:07:53,530
which is even crazier,

5022
02:07:53,531 --> 02:07:55,270
was put up by a troll account.

5023
02:07:55,460 --> 02:07:55,871
Right?

5024
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:56,704
Russians,

5025
02:07:57,070 --> 02:07:58,310
I don't know who the fuck it was,

5026
02:07:58,360 --> 02:07:59,980
what they know all the problems.

5027
02:07:59,981 --> 02:08:04,020
Russian planes that came out of Brazil
because I saw something yesterday,

5028
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:09,270
a few shady social media posts fed a
viral firestorm over coving and Catholic.

5029
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:09,911
Oh sure.

5030
02:08:09,911 --> 02:08:10,780
Why it will happen again.

5031
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:11,470
Yeah.

5032
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:12,610
These co the,

5033
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:14,830
they're doing this on purpose,

5034
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:15,141
the,

5035
02:08:15,141 --> 02:08:18,820
they took that screenshot to try
to get people angry and it worked.

5036
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:22,540
And then they Twitter found out that it
was a bullshit account and banned the

5037
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:23,374
account.

5038
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:25,600
So it's very possible that
account was some troll.

5039
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:26,121
Oh No,

5040
02:08:26,121 --> 02:08:27,220
it's a troll farm.

5041
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:27,820
Wow.

5042
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:28,600
Yeah.

5043
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:29,460
So that's what they'd say.

5044
02:08:29,860 --> 02:08:32,770
We're being manipulated now on a
level that is like unbelievable.

5045
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:33,520
Unbelievable,

5046
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:34,270
unbelievable.

5047
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:35,440
And people are furious.

5048
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:35,951
Dude,

5049
02:08:35,951 --> 02:08:37,090
I hate to cut this short,

5050
02:08:37,091 --> 02:08:38,170
but I gotta get the fuck out of here.

5051
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:38,920
Let's do it.

5052
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:42,370
Tell everybody how to get ahold
of you on Instagram and Twitter.

5053
02:08:42,371 --> 02:08:43,880
D I.

5054
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:43,880
L.

5055
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:43,880
L.

5056
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:43,880
O.

5057
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:43,880
N.

5058
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:44,020
Uh,

5059
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:44,853
Timothy,

5060
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:45,551
Tim Dillon,

5061
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:47,290
comedy.com we're doing a Gig,

5062
02:08:47,291 --> 02:08:47,840
right?

5063
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:48,760
What'd you to tomorrow?

5064
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:49,271
That's right.

5065
02:08:49,271 --> 02:08:51,540
Tomorrow at the Improv and 15 shuttle.

5066
02:08:51,541 --> 02:08:52,810
He attacks me on the way.

5067
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,110
Let's see.

5068
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:55,750
It's going to show up for
the news to the subway,

5069
02:08:55,751 --> 02:08:57,320
so I hope I get in blackface.

5070
02:08:57,390 --> 02:08:58,223
Thank you.

5071
02:08:59,140 --> 02:08:59,770
Thank you,

5072
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:00,041
Tim.

5073
02:09:00,041 --> 02:09:00,281
Down.

5074
02:09:00,281 --> 02:09:01,114
Ladies and gentlemen.

5075
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:02,501
Thanks a lot of fun,

5076
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:02,640
man.
