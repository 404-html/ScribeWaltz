1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,710
Chilson and non coffee enthusiasts.
Coffee,

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,563
coffee,
noninclusive.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,610
Well I drink it every day and I like
coffee,

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,200
but I've got a doctorate a little bit,
you know,

5
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:15,470
I've gotten copy mates and the hazel
nuts.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,333
I've got to do all that stuff.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,030
Uses Jazz Stevia.
No,

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,420
no,
but may I is good.

9
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:20,050
Yeah,
please.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,590
It's stronger than sugar so don't put it
in like you would do sugar,

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,000
but it's a completely natural available
everywhere.

12
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:31,180
All sorts of health food stores and
whole foods carries it.

13
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:33,700
It's a uh,
just a plant based sweetener.

14
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,620
Not Sugar.
Not Bad for you then give you the DAB.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,590
This doesn't,
um,

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,100
doesn't fuck with you.
Like aspartame does.

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,960
Some people don't like the taste of it,
but I like it.

18
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,590
And the fact that I can get away with it
where I can drink and I know there's no

19
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:48,940
sugar at all.
I like it a lot.

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,850
Are they a sponsor?
We do an a plug right now.

21
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,900
I don't like it.
I could say I know about safe sex.

22
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:59,160
We don't even sell it.
So I'm a fan of it.

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,260
So here,
here's my theory on coffee and I think

24
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,620
this is true.
If if coffee wasn't around and I

25
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:08,800
discovered it and I sat you and Jamie
down and I slid a cup across the tape

26
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,920
and go try this guys,
I want,

27
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:13,800
I want $50,000 from both of you.
I'm going to build this coffee.

28
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,330
Taste this.
You'd go,

29
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,400
you're out of your mind.
You want to give me a dollar?

30
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:17,761
They'd go,
no,

31
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:17,910
no,
no,

32
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,960
no.
Not only,

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,570
not only am I going to sell this for a
profit,

34
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,300
I'm going to put sprinkles in it.
I'm going to put it in a fancy cup.

35
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:24,811
I'm,
I'm gonna.

36
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm gonna.
Mix whipped cream on top and sell it at

37
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,190
300 percent profit.
You could just get out

38
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,600
and tell you.
Well maybe,

39
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:35,080
I mean a very small niche market maybe.
I mean,

40
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,400
it's not like it's going to be
everywhere.

41
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,430
It's not bad,
right?

42
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,070
That Stevia is good.
It's not bad.

43
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,170
It's Kinda like a little bit of a
bitterness to it.

44
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,950
It doesn't taste as good as sugar,
but for me it's a good compromise

45
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,140
knowing that there's no,
nothing negative about it,

46
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,620
but I'm going,
this is how you start your show.

47
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:51,970
I like this.
No Big Internet.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,550
You just turned it on.
It's not necessarily share the man.

49
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,160
No one else could pull that off really
good.

50
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:00,190
They just need to do it.
If you just didn't worry,

51
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,750
if everybody just didn't worry,
they would just do it this way.

52
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,440
I suppose you're right.
So whatever we talk about today is,

53
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:09,010
there is nothing going on.
No,

54
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,370
I mean it just seems like it's just
nothing happening.

55
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,880
It's just an average Monday,
a couple of coffee drinkers here.

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,433
I,
uh,

57
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,880
you know,
we're all trying to figure out if

58
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,950
they're going to sell,
sell or not.

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,180
Right?
And I'm on the other side of the fence

60
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,470
from a lot of the reports.
I'm going,

61
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:24,161
God,
I hope so.

62
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,210
What a cool thing.
I mean,

63
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,140
they can sell the work they put in the
risks.

64
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,350
They built this interest in that.
The ultimate thing you want to do with

65
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,750
the business day one,
when you sit down to start a business,

66
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,880
you want to create something so cool.
Somebody else wants to buy it,

67
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,940
so I'm on the other side of the fence.
All of these reports were coming out

68
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:38,620
like this was going to be earth
shattering news.

69
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,790
I'm good.
This is going to be great.

70
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,940
This is if you like them,
if they've done something for you and

71
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:45,190
you're cheering for him than cheer that
this goes through.

72
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,800
Particularly if you retain Dane,
and that was the other part of the

73
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,570
report was that Dane was gonna.
Stay on.

74
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:50,470
Well,
that's relevant.

75
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,200
There's not another.
There's not another guy alive that can

76
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:56,920
run that and that's not some nice
statement to Damon Damon.

77
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,440
That's just the truth.
Like you can't go to a library and check

78
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,040
out a book on

79
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,620
fight promotion.
You can't go to any college and major in

80
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,720
promotion.
You either know it or you don't.

81
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,151
Yeah,
it's.

82
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:10,151
It's difficult and it requires all day.
Like Dana's working all day,

83
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,840
like people for people that don't.
I'll call him at like 1:00 in the

84
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,380
morning and he just got off the phone
and he's doing deals and he's making

85
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,660
things happen and he's trying and he's
obsessed with it.

86
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,680
I mean I got really does love the
business of putting together fights.

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
We will.
I'll,

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,060
we'll talk randomly just in the middle
of nowhere about fights for hours.

89
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,070
He just loves to talk fights.
He really is a big fan and obsessed and

90
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:36,280
not burnt out yet,
which is amazing because the amount of

91
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:40,240
hours that guy puts in and obviously
he's making a shitload of fucking money,

92
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,510
but it's still the amount of hours that
he puts in.

93
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,130
You would think he would be cooked by
now.

94
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,043
Yeah,
you would.

95
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,390
And I know what you mean.
One am is a good time to get ahold of

96
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:49,530
him.
I was in Brazil.

97
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,350
He called and woke me up.
I was doing the ultimate fighter.

98
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:56,400
He walked me as 4:00 AM and I grabbed
the phone and he was talking business

99
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,110
right away and I just said,
Dane,

100
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,670
I got,
I'm not here.

101
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,680
Right.
And whatever I agreed to right now,

102
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,750
I get a pass because if you give them
your word,

103
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,651
that's it.
Right,

104
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:07,410
right.
Whatever I agree to does not see I'm out

105
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:08,590
of it.
It's 4:00 AM.

106
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,331
And he goes,
Oh man,

107
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,800
it's 4:00 AM.
And I said,

108
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:11,634
yeah.
And he goes,

109
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,260
dude,
I thought it was only two.

110
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:16,260
I'm really sorry for calling.
But he was,

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,840
he was serious.
He was serious.

112
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,280
And so it was like,
okay,

113
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:20,881
I get it,
man.

114
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,740
If you're working on.
And it was the office line,

115
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,620
it wasn't his cell line.
He was at the office and I'm going,

116
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:26,580
okay,
well look,

117
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,220
if you're going to work for him in
Brazil,

118
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,590
what time is that in America?
That's got to be 10.

119
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:32,690
They're not that far ahead.
Where are they?

120
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,890
They're there for six hours.
I was in Sao Paulo,

121
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,480
so it was still,
you know,

122
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,980
he's in there grinding.

123
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,840
That was a ballsy move.
Have you to do the ultimate fighter in

124
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:46,841
Brazil after you had talked mad shit
about virtually every legend that ever

125
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,534
came out of.

126
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,670
Yeah.
And to understand.

127
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,690
Thank you for saying it,
but it's also relevant to understand how

128
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:59,480
big MMA is over there.
You get away with that here and there's

129
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:01,700
gonna be some pockets that know exactly
who you are,

130
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,790
but it's going to be just that pockets
in Brazil.

131
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:08,630
It's the number two sport behind soccer.
Everybody knows.

132
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:11,120
And I had a,
I had armed security.

133
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,420
We went everywhere in bulletproof cars
and uh,

134
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
and one night I'm the guns came out and
whatever bravado you think you have or

135
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:24,830
you think you will have when the guns
come out,

136
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,980
you find out it's not true.
You're scared.

137
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,820
What happened there?
This is an actual move,

138
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,460
like there's a name for this and it's
very common in Brazil,

139
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:38,120
but we were going to traffic and a guy
cut in front of us and then what they'd

140
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,540
like to do is cut in front of you,
slow down and they get boxed in.

141
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,170
They jump out and rob you.
So when the guy swerved out,

142
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:44,330
we're in three lanes,
traffic.

143
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,910
There was nobody else on the road.
So when the guy cut in front of us,

144
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,400
security knew right was going on.
They pulled their gun out,

145
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:52,070
my wife was in the back and she was
sleeping.

146
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:55,680
She was laying down,
she had her feet across me and uh,

147
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,150
I woke her and I said

148
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,600
he got his gun and uh,
there was an exit right up and the guy

149
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,430
swerved over as quick as he cut in front
of us,

150
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,380
took the exit was gone.
Nothing happened at all.

151
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,510
But in that moment you find out when the
guns come out,

152
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,470
what ever macho is you think you're
going to have in that situation?

153
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,240
You don't have to,
were you think in like,

154
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,520
why did I talk all that Shit I've just
said,

155
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:22,550
yeah,
I had no way to know I was in the car.

156
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,430
I mean,
I think they were just getting ready or

157
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,090
at least the,
the security thought they were just

158
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:27,320
getting ready to rob us,
you know,

159
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,700
it had.
But yeah.

160
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,050
Yeah,
I did.

161
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,700
Yeah,
that's true.

162
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,570
You know,
that's true.

163
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,990
Getting.
Can nobody here take a joke,

164
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:39,740
am my job,
but ended up being a great time.

165
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
It ended up being a really great time.

166
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,530
The ultimate fighter just isn't
generally.

167
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:46,370
I had the opportunity to have them,
but you build lifelong relationships.

168
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,900
You know,
you stay friends with those guys.

169
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:51,710
You watch them being vulnerable.
You watch them putting their whole life,

170
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,800
everything into it.
These get leaving their families.

171
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,200
The first ultimate fighter I did,
we had two holidays.

172
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,770
I'm counting thing.
A Halloween is when I realized that

173
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,970
isn't a holiday,
but if you have kids that's a big day.

174
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,460
Skies leave their kids.
They don't get to see them dress up and

175
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,160
then we had thanksgiving.
They don't even get a call home.

176
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,560
One guy had the birth of his first
child.

177
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,010
He did not get to call in and check on
his wife.

178
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,570
I mean it's.
It's a big deal.

179
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,770
What goes on and they are very strict.
I don't know why they are joe.

180
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,330
I realized that for reality TV that,
that,

181
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,430
that,
that turmoil is build something,

182
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,590
but I'm kind of looking at going,
you know what?

183
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,350
Let's do this little nine to five deal.
Send them home,

184
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,230
give them their cell phones.
Let these guys just be regular guys.

185
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,010
People talk too much.
They tell too many secrets.

186
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,280
They,
they explain what's going on to talk to

187
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,260
press.
They give inside scoops and will only be

188
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,170
revealed,
you know,

189
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,950
I promise you this won't be revealed
until the show goes to air.

190
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,170
There's a lot of fuckery that goes on
with,

191
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,310
with people that are on reality shows.
That's what they're trying to overlay.

192
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,170
A funny word fucker.
He's one of my favorite words.

193
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
Great words,
but yeah,

194
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:56,480
there's truth to that.
But you are your appearance on the

195
00:07:56,481 --> 00:08:00,770
ultimate fighter in Brazil with vangely
to it sort of changed like vandalize

196
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,820
public opinion right now is very,
very high.

197
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,100
Like people like him again,
and one of the reasons why they like him

198
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,650
is because he got fucked over by the
Nevada state athletic commission,

199
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,484
hardcore.

200
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,950
They banned him for life,
for missing a drug test,

201
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,420
which I just think is fucking tyranny.
I think that's straight bullshit.

202
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,170
I think that that is a fucking horrible
miscarriage of justice.

203
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,120
If you think the guy was doing
something,

204
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,340
then you find him and you,
you,

205
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,450
you banned him for the amount of time
that you need to based on if he was

206
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,440
guilty.
That's it.

207
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,270
You don't get to do life that's fucking
crazy to do,

208
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,880
to be so callous to show that you are a
governing body and that you are taking

209
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:41,540
care of the future of these athletes and
supposedly protecting them from other

210
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:45,320
athletes that are cheating or from from
whatever other nonsense,

211
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,660
whatever other illegal activity might be
going on,

212
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,960
and to take that position of power and
into flagrantly abuse it in that way

213
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:54,740
where you're just,
you're,

214
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,190
you're openly showing

215
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,380
them that you don't give a fuck about
them.

216
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,780
You don't care about their career,
you don't care that this is the only way

217
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:03,750
they have to make a living and you just
going to ban them for life because they

218
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,730
missed a drug test.
So let me,

219
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,350
let me give you another side of this
too.

220
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,160
Vandelay never told his side.
Vandelay got pissed and he yelled and he

221
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,390
went to,
created all of these things,

222
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:14,910
but he never just sat down and told his
side calmly.

223
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:17,910
So here's vandelay side,
and when you hear this,

224
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,790
you're going to,
you're going to side with vandelay.

225
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,120
Here's what happened.
I was the first guy ever tested,

226
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
uh,
in this random out of competition

227
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,920
testing,
so none of us knew what it was.

228
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:32,490
And you have to take that time into
perspective because now guys understand,

229
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:33,660
look,
you get a knock on the door,

230
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,580
you must,
you must comply.

231
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,880
But I was the first one ever took,
we'd never heard of this guy shows up.

232
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,570
Vandelay was to be the second one
tested,

233
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,810
but did it,
did it test.

234
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,290
In hindsight,
I shouldn't have tested.

235
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,090
I'm not even sure they were within their
rights.

236
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,000
And this is relevant.
They show up.

237
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:54,690
The guy has no id,
absolutely no identification of who he

238
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:57,660
is.
I think that's a problem to start with

239
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,980
you then.
He's a huge.

240
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,780
He then wants to take me into a back
room which ended up being a janitor's

241
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,010
closet,
not sanitary,

242
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,480
a backroom at the MGM grand.
He takes me in there where I must

243
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:11,960
disrobe and present to him my penis
because he,

244
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,220
w he watches,
you know,

245
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,580
that's a very private thing.
And the ID,

246
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,570
he wants to see your dad and if there's
a look and they need to.

247
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,690
I understand now and I think a lot more
of us do to that you're going to have to

248
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,130
get naked and do this so you get wisdom.

249
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,010
You got all these weird things going on
at that time though.

250
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:30,480
That's a weird thing that we're in the
back of the mgm grand in a dirty closet

251
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:33,120
and I'm presenting to a stranger who
refuses,

252
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,350
not only doesn't offer id,
refused to give id and I tried to take a

253
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:40,020
picture of the son of a bitch and he
told me I could not do that.

254
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,710
Why I backed down and did it to.
I don't know.

255
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,410
I just accepted his authority,
but in hindsight call me.

256
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,191
I'm at.
Yeah,

257
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,180
exactly.
I should've.

258
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,030
I should've,
but I was caught off guard that had

259
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,620
never been done before and I'm kind of
just going along,

260
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:57,621
but I am caught off guard by this.
He then wants to stick a needle into

261
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:01,230
your vein and draw blood.
I'm in a back,

262
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,380
unsanitary room.
Anything I've ever learned in school.

263
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,780
You don't do things with intermediate
needles.

264
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,790
You don't take.
This guy has no idea.

265
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,070
He's not in a lab coat,
doesn't look the part at all.

266
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,950
Uh,
so now I presented myself naked to him

267
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:18,690
and now he's got a needle in my vein and
I'm signing paperwork that I haven't had

268
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,270
time to read.
So when he goes to now understand,

269
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,330
I speak English,
we at least speak the same language.

270
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,730
Also take into consideration that kind
of got in fairness,

271
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,800
perfectly nice guy trying to feed his
family,

272
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:31,650
but in fairness,
what kind of person says,

273
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,460
I want to go around and collect people's
Pii.

274
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,260
It's an interesting kind of guy.
So I'm with.

275
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,120
I'm with an interesting character to
start with.

276
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:41,610
Now I'm naked.
Now he's poking me with needles in a

277
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:45,540
dirty backroom at the MGM grand.
He leaves there and goes to test

278
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,620
vandelay.
Well,

279
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,630
when you take everything I said into
consideration,

280
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,280
nobody knew about random testing.

281
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,270
Nobody knew about a sudden.
Nobody knew anything about this,

282
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,190
that out of competition,
silver vandelay to go,

283
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,180
hey,
I don't know who you are.

284
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,700
You're not presenting it.
I don't fully understand you.

285
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,750
That's fair.
And vandelay talked to them and said,

286
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,450
you want me to sign a contract?
Get my attorney on the phone,

287
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:06,070
show me what this thing says.
You know,

288
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:09,060
he's Kinda going through the p and the
way the story was told us that vandelay

289
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,910
just turned and ran.
Well,

290
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,010
that wasn't true.
He stood his ground and talk to this guy

291
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:12,821
for awhile.
He said,

292
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:14,600
get on the phone with an attorney.
Prove to me who you are.

293
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,780
He did all of these things and then
finally said,

294
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,580
look,
I got to get to a press conference.

295
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,580
I'm leaving.
Got In his car and drove right to the

296
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,610
MGM for the press conference and I
didn't have this backstory at the press

297
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,960
conference,
but that's what vandelay did.

298
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,360
So when the story came out that he
turned and bolted out the back,

299
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,460
that's not true.
He stood and talked to the guy.

300
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:34,900
He tried to reason with them.
Vandelays never told calmly his side of

301
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,540
the story and that's his side and that
makes a lot of sense.

302
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,580
Even in today's standards.
That makes sense.

303
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:44,110
But back then when no one knew that drug
testers could be showing up,

304
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,830
and once they showed up that you needed
to present yourself naked,

305
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,580
that you needed to accept,
uh,

306
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,140
you know,
that they were going to draw blood.

307
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,530
Yeah,
man vandal.

308
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:54,130
He had the right to say no.
Call my attorney.

309
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,450
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on here.

310
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,290
And the guy wouldn't show id that's
relevant as very relevant when they

311
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,030
banned him for life.
It's crazy.

312
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,770
Come on.

313
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,340
No,
you,

314
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,860
the way you describe it.
I didn't know it.

315
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:04,430
Was that okay.

316
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,160
Yeah.
I never told him what all he's done is

317
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:07,941
yell.
And I've always thought,

318
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:08,480
no.
Wait,

319
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,000
vandelay timeout.
You've actually got a really good site

320
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:13,160
here.
Come and tell it now.

321
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:15,050
Under today's standards is a little bit
different.

322
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,730
Um,
because we know what's going on and we

323
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:18,400
know there's,

324
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,780
don't know that some crazy Internet
troll can't pretend he's a Usada guy.

325
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,210
Show up.
Drag you into a bathroom and take a

326
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:26,560
picture of your Dick.
Exactly.

327
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,050
And they will and won't let you won't.
Let,

328
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,170
won't document who he is.
We'll let you just take a simple picture

329
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:32,801
of him.
Well,

330
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,420
that's insane that they don't have to
show Id.

331
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,010
I mean that.
That's tyranny right there.

332
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,980
There,
there has to be some sort of due process

333
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:42,910
and the athletes are already in a
disadvantageous position in the first

334
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:43,870
place.
I mean,

335
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:45,430
they,
they can be fired.

336
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,950
They mean this,
this random thing that just shows up,

337
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,600
which I don't want.
I don't know what kind of

338
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:53,860
constitutionality or what,
what kind of legalities involved and

339
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:56,710
just randomly testing someone's bodily
fluids.

340
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,770
I mean,
I guess you sign a contract agreeing to

341
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:00,910
that,
but boy,

342
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,830
that feels.
That feels shaky.

343
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,750
Yeah.
It feels like that can be disputed.

344
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,920
And to your point,
you now do sign a contract and you agree

345
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,890
to go into this pool,
but back then we did not,

346
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,401
you know,
I was,

347
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,560
I was the first guy.
Vandelay was the second guy.

348
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,630
Uh,
we both ended up with suspensions,

349
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,150
but it was different.
It's like,

350
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:18,451
well,
Hey,

351
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:19,620
wait,
if you're going to do this,

352
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:21,930
you got to tell us or you or you got to
tell me right on the spot,

353
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,880
but you've got to at least prove who you
are.

354
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,840
And I would imagine the women must have
women testers come out to watch them,

355
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,310
but I don't know that for sure.
You know,

356
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:32,310
you hear this thing about these tsa pat
downs and the women feeling violated.

357
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:34,110
We haven't heard any women's say that
yet,

358
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,680
but at some point,
you know,

359
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,280
I just think there's a fine line there.
They might have to be a little bit

360
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:38,950
careful.

361
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,250
Well,
vandelay had his lifelong suspension

362
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,150
thrown out.
Right?

363
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,300
So now he's still in limbo though
because they haven't decided how long he

364
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,500
gets suspended.
And what they've done is.

365
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,190
And by the way,
how many years ago was this when this

366
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,024
took place?
Three,

367
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,480
three years ago.
So the man has not been able to earn a

368
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,510
living in three years doing what he does
best,

369
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,340
which is fight.
And he is,

370
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,960
he's a legend.
I mean,

371
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:06,920
if you're going to have a mixed martial
arts hall of fame and you don't include

372
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,410
vandelay Silva,
you got a bullshit mixed martial arts

373
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:10,640
hall of fame.
I mean,

374
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:13,880
you talking about a guy who was the
pride champion for a long time,

375
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,470
you know,
had incredible fight,

376
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,490
legendary fights and his beloved.
My point was when you and him went at it

377
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,530
on the ultimate fighter,
his fucking popularity crashed because

378
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:29,840
you made them look foolish.
He looks silly.

379
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,440
He wanted to start a fight with you.
He was trying to intimidate you and it

380
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:35,180
wasn't working.
You're like,

381
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,070
please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

382
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,310
And then finally you wind up taking them
down and just like Jesus Christ,

383
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,690
like,
what the fuck are we doing here?

384
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,351
Yeah,
it was,

385
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,970
it was really weird.
And uh,

386
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,740
you know,
trying to explain that to vandelay on

387
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,150
the set,
what was a battle to and,

388
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,540
and vandelay walked out on the very
first day.

389
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,950
He demanded an apology.
He said,

390
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,450
yeah,
he comes in front of everybody.

391
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,870
Cameras are rolling.
We're about to pick teams.

392
00:15:56,871 --> 00:16:00,290
So it's got all the guys there and his
way of taking the moral high ground was

393
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,990
to demand.
I apologize and if I don't then he

394
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:05,030
quits.
It's like Vandelay,

395
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,940
why'd you put yourself in that position?
I'm not gonna apologize,

396
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:10,010
but why would you say you're going to
quit now?

397
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,210
You have to quit.
Now.

398
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,100
You have to walk out.
So he does.

399
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,470
When I,
when I call his is he walks off the set

400
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,090
camera,
stop everything.

401
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,890
They put us in the back and,
and I'm telling the producers I'm not

402
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,150
going to come out and apologize.

403
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,920
Call Vittorio Vituro.
Come out and do it.

404
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,570
We'll have torn a plane.
That's how we're going to solve this.

405
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:29,450
Now we can't call it a uh,
yeah,

406
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,040
we get.
We got to work this out with Angela.

407
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,120
Could you please a pledge?
I said,

408
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,530
look,
I want this show to go forward,

409
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:37,760
but this is the storyline.
The storyline is the bad guy has come to

410
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,820
Brazil.
Vandelay gets to be the White Knight on

411
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,830
the Horse.
Let's continue the script.

412
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:46,190
So I had to talk to vandelay and a
private room and I had explained that to

413
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,024
him.
Like Mandalay,

414
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,040
I get what you're doing here and you're
trying to be the good guy,

415
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,370
but guess what,
you are just let me go do what I do.

416
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,310
Okay.
You will come off as the knight in

417
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,490
shining armor and I'm okay with that.
You're not okay being the bag.

418
00:16:58,491 --> 00:16:59,324
I am.

419
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,250
You Go,
do you let me do meet the scripts

420
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,050
already out there.
That's why we have this job.

421
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,340
And I couldn't reason with him Joe.
He really did not understand it.

422
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:08,510
And he does.
He's saying,

423
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,650
Oh,
you know,

424
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,310
on and on and on and uh,
you know,

425
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,850
I,
I,

426
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,770
and I broke it down to a zoo.
Yeah,

427
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:17,900
he was doing that.
I was breaking it down and he's telling

428
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:21,070
me how I'm doing everything wrong and in
my sportsmen ships off and,

429
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,370
and my promotions.
But,

430
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,390
and I said,
stop.

431
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,780
I said,
George St Pierre Left Brock list or I'm

432
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,790
the guy.
I'm the highest paid guy in the UFC

433
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,880
right now.
I'm not the guy you tell how to promote.

434
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm the guy you cop and I was just
trying to level with them.

435
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm the guy you copy.
That's the reason that,

436
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,120
that all these things are happening.
And uh,

437
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,070
he,
he agreed with me on that.

438
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,180
He goes,
I understand that,

439
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,610
but I don't like how you did that.
I don't.

440
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:46,251
Like I said,
great.

441
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:48,200
Then here's what we're going to do.
We're going to do this show.

442
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,130
Okay,
I'm going to to be the bad guy.

443
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,410
And then we're gonna fight.
And if you're so sure you're going to.

444
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,271
I mean this,
this,

445
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,010
this is your moment.
And he was ranting on me for the

446
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:56,844
andersons thing,
I,

447
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,770
I said,
did you see how that fight worked out?

448
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,810
Okay.
I took my punishment,

449
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,010
man.
I had to eat it all.

450
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,840
It's an embarrassing thing,
but I did it that,

451
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,020
that's my payback for that.
You and I are on a separate deal.

452
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,880
You're trying to insert yourself in an
Anderson fight.

453
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,860
Anderson already took care of that
matter.

454
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,090
Okay.
He handled his button,

455
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,270
but now you've got to handle yours.
And it was just a weird thing and we

456
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:16,440
just,
we just couldn't.

457
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,490
We just couldn't come around.
Well you are an interesting guy to get

458
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:25,491
into these altercations with because
you're very logical and because you can

459
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:30,900
say a bunch of crazy shit and not take
it personal and I just don't think that

460
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,210
he has that kind of mentality.
His mind,

461
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,630
his
depression,

462
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,550
but that's him.
I mean he just wants to throw down and

463
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,960
so he expected you to butt heads with
them and you're like,

464
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:44,070
hey man,
come on.

465
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:45,540
We're here to make some money.
We're on TV.

466
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,070
We're going to promote this zoo.

467
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,060
And it just,
there was no fucking way he was.

468
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,080
I mean he just came into this with this
idea that he was going to go shoot the

469
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:01,080
buck style that he was going to get in
your face and get angry and maybe you

470
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:03,090
guys were brought on the set,
you know,

471
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,310
but you just weren't having it.
I wasn't having an end,

472
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,000
but I also understood this vandelay I
want to be the bad guy and this is my

473
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:12,570
brand and this is what I'm doing.
I'm the only guy on that side of the

474
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:15,850
pool because I'm the only guy that's
willing to be so I'm the biggest healing

475
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,210
in the business right now,
and I know this.

476
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:22,080
If I come into your country by myself
and not speaking the language and you

477
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,490
team up,
you gang,

478
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,920
you team up on me,
I become vulnerable.

479
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,740
If they see me as vulnerable,
they're going to like me.

480
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,320
I don't want to be like you're ruining
everything.

481
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,080
And I knew if we,
if push came to shove,

482
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,810
they're going to take vandelay side.
I'm going to come and short,

483
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,660
but in the world of public opinion,
I'm going to come out on top,

484
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,200
which I've worked very hard that I don't
want to be on that side.

485
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,210
That's not where I'm trying to be.
I'm down there,

486
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:46,410
okay,
and I'm all by myself,

487
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:51,411
which means I'm ruling that part of the
market and I was pleading with him when

488
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,030
he was trying to get in a street fight.
I remember even saying to him,

489
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:56,550
please stop like Vangelis,
please.

490
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:58,350
I don't this.
I don't want to do this.

491
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,960
Let's get a date.
Let's save it for the octagon and he

492
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:01,680
just,
he,

493
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,020
he saw that as weakness and as soon as
he saw the weakness,

494
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,280
he started picking on me.

495
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,801
He's like,
vandelay,

496
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:08,220
if you pick on me,
I become likable.

497
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,040
I don't want that.
That's what this is all about.

498
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,970
Okay,
I'm down there.

499
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,410
You guys be down here.
Okay,

500
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,720
I'll be the nerd sitting at the end of
the pool by himself,

501
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:20,640
but that's still my end of the pool.
Will you approach this in a very

502
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,280
calculated way,
which is very rare for people when

503
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,980
they're doing promotion for fights.
You know,

504
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:27,570
there's shit-talking,
there's,

505
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,400
you know,
people say I'm the best ever.

506
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,140
They Brag,
they do all sorts of different things,

507
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,440
but it's very rare that they purposely
put themselves in one position and you

508
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,960
did it on purpose and you,
you are the only guy that really had a

509
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,220
vision.
You like,

510
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,070
look,
everybody out here is doing it one way,

511
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,160
but there's a way to do it completely
over the top,

512
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,340
but you obviously

513
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,450
had skills to back it up as well,
but you were completely over the top and

514
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,510
you cherish the role.
Like when you took the microphone,

515
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,870
went

516
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,720
Anderson Silva,
you absolutely suck.

517
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,060
Like the whole place started cheering.
It's like,

518
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,170
ah,
he's.

519
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,560
He's gone straight pro wrestling.
Like you're the first guy to ever do

520
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,220
that,
right?

521
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,360
Yeah.
Let's cut a promo.

522
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:09,850
I mean let's tame attainment.
You know we are an entertainment and I

523
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:14,500
firmly believe when one fight ends,
the marketing for the next fight begins

524
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,850
right then,
right?

525
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:19,090
That are paying attention the most.
When I hear people tell you all the day,

526
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,680
who do you want to fight next and you're
giving them an opportunity where your

527
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,670
softball on them right down the middle
and they say,

528
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,520
anybody in their message what they,
what they want to be related.

529
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,700
I'm not a bully.
I'll take on anybody.

530
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,410
I'll take on all comers.
I don't care.

531
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,960
I get that,
but that's not what people are hearing.

532
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,620
If you say you don't care,
how can you expect anybody else to?

533
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,430
If you tell the whole world,
I don't care who I'm fighting,

534
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,780
well then how in the hell can a fan
care?

535
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,200
How can they care about you?
You got to care whether it's a personal

536
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,180
thing,
whether whether it's a career move,

537
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:50,530
whether it's the title of whatever it
is,

538
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,990
you have to care and there has to be an
answer.

539
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:54,100
If you don't care.
I don't care.

540
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,500
Nobody's ever gotten a job job by
telling the guy,

541
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,470
interviewing him,
I don't.

542
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,140
I don't care.
Well that I can't hire you.

543
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,050
I just can't hire you.
Yeah.

544
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,700
Especially if there's someone who does
care.

545
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
Now there's a mention of when,
when I tried to get in your podcast

546
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,380
today,
if you'd have said,

547
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:09,730
hey,
are you free on Monday?

548
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:10,290
And I go,
no,

549
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,230
I don't care.
You Go,

550
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,360
well then I'll just call somebody else
jail.

551
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,390
I need a guy in the studio that wants to
be here.

552
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,170
What you do?
I want to be here.

553
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,420
Well,
I wouldn't worry about that with you if

554
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,530
you said I don't care.
I said,

555
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,320
but like good sales in a weird mood.
This is going to be a fun podcast.

556
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,660
Fair enough.
But there's a.

557
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:26,240
there's an

558
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,400
psychology that goes along with fighting
and one of them,

559
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,100
one of the things that happens to people
when they're preparing for a fight,

560
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:36,101
and you could speak to this,
is that there's a sort of a compulsion

561
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:37,990
or a,
a,

562
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,710
a feeling that you would like to avoid
thinking about the fight as much as

563
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,310
possible.
There's,

564
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,060
um,
there's a natural sort of attraction to

565
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,980
just putting it aside.
Let's like,

566
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,440
let's just not think about this.
Let's not think about this at all.

567
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,270
Let's only focus on the task at hand and
when the task in hand is over,

568
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,560
then we're going to take a break.
And when a fight is over and the relief

569
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:03,120
has hit,
a guy like to shift gears and go

570
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,730
straight into promo mode.
Sometimes guys have done it and they've

571
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:10,670
done it and it comes off artificial and
it comes off clunky.

572
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,010
It actually hurts them more than it
helps them.

573
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,180
Like it seems like it takes a very
specific type of personality to be able

574
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:18,230
to pull that off.
Correct.

575
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:18,570
Directly.

576
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,710
I think that's fair.
Yeah.

577
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:22,980
And I've seen some guys do it and I.
Ben Rothwell comes to mind.

578
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,650
Yeah,
well we'll have some pocketed and even

579
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:27,990
an awkwardness or something to see
there.

580
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,730
It's not a total miss.
It.

581
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,890
It does come across as pocket and
scripted in.

582
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:36,891
My only advice to Rothwell is if you
have a pocket of statement and you're

583
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:39,840
not ready for the followup question,
drop the mic and walk away.

584
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,600
Here's your bit.
An exit stage left.

585
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,700
And yes,
it's very hard.

586
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,510
It's hard to say something you want to
say.

587
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,210
And when the followup question comes,
you go back into being yourself.

588
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,770
That's very hard.
You've got your look.

589
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,890
If you take a character,
you finished the character until it's

590
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,720
done.
And if you're stuck.

591
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,670
Walkaway.
Yeah.

592
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,820
Like Daniel Cormier,
when I interviewed him after he beat

593
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,950
Rumble Johnson,
John Jones,

594
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,960
get your shit together.
That's it.

595
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,360
Perfect.

596
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,060
Yeah,
it was great.

597
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,680
It was perfect.
So Dan,

598
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,580
let's stay on.
Daniel.

599
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,870
Daniel this week was in one of the.
It was a very weird spot.

600
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,470
So Daniel comes in.
He's not just a good guy of mma.

601
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:19,550
Joe,
he's the great guy.

602
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,090
Daniel never will somebody meet that guy
face to face,

603
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:25,910
but what did your never will?
What's amazing is how much he gets

604
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,560
booed.
That's my point,

605
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:30,890
but everybody hates him.
You then have John Jones who is a real

606
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:35,600
life heal that wants to be loved and for
some reason the crowd used to be against

607
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,910
him and now they find out he's really
find out who he is.

608
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,140
They love it.
They're in.

609
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,120
Why do they?
They love him more.

610
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,280
They love him more.
Now that he's keeps fucking up.

611
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,730
Daniel Cormier was at a press conference
with Jones and Jones says,

612
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,310
I've been sober for three months,
and the crowd goes crazy.

613
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,710
They then shift the camera over to
Daniel.

614
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:53,090
The whole crowd starts.
We hadn't even said anything.

615
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,100
They all start booing.
Daniel takes a mic and goes,

616
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,160
you guys are cheering that.
He's been sober for 90 days.

617
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:01,190
I've been sober for 36 years.
They boom again.

618
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,490
They hated it.
So Daniel gets put in this weird spot.

619
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,900
He brings that momentum into this fight.
He then becomes vulnerable.

620
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,840
His heart's out there.
He shows the world that he takes the

621
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:12,680
high road.
He says,

622
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:15,620
I think that Jon Jones made a mistake.
I've made mistakes before.

623
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:17,120
He starts telling these personal
stories,

624
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,970
his heart that he's in tears.
Everybody loves him.

625
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,580
All of a sudden he goes into the fight.
Anderson,

626
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:23,720
boom,
people.

627
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,920
People love the appreciation.
He stepped up great middle,

628
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,250
all these different things.
Daniel gets beat or rather beats him.

629
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,600
The crowd boos and the Daniel tries to
address the audience explaining himself.

630
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,960
It's like Daniel,
a couple of rules and politics.

631
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,790
First off,
you steer into a problem of a crowd

632
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,400
wants to boot.
You don't ever ask them for their

633
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,520
approval.
You take the mic,

634
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,600
you hold your belt up high.
You thank them all for the percentage of

635
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:50,360
their ticket sales that you got.
You tell him to shove their opinion up

636
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:53,510
their ass and you walk away.
If you're explaining,

637
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,090
you're losing.
Do not explain yourself.

638
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,560
Do not say,
I had to do what I had to do.

639
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,870
There's such A.
I'm tired of the misrepresentations

640
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,540
representations and fighting.
It comes all the way from the top.

641
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,510
We hear that the fans want to guys that
are going to go out there and bang,

642
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:06,321
well,
that's not true.

643
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:07,850
The biggest draw in the history of the
sports,

644
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,100
George St Pierre,
he never went up there and banged with

645
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,460
anybody who finishes it is a very
handsome man.

646
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,500
He's very marketable.
I will concede that,

647
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,850
but the bottom line is that's not
necessarily what people want and the

648
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:24,851
exact same game plan that did is what
lester did five minutes later and

649
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,080
everybody loved it.
That that's not what it's about.

650
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:30,080
What they decided they want to see
Anderson when they weren't upset that

651
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,030
they were on the ground there.
Whereas if they weren't on their feet

652
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:33,740
because they knew that's where I
understood could knock him out and they

653
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:36,950
decided they were going to cheer for
Anderson Cormier.

654
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,410
I should have just told him to shove it
up their ass and they'd be stuck.

655
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,360
Yeah,
but that's not him at all.

656
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,010
But he wants to be liked.
He wants to be like

657
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,360
Joe,
I understand that,

658
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,060
but that's not the way to be.
Like the only way to be liked as him to

659
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:51,780
beat the shit out of John Jones.
I mean that was the only way because

660
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:56,220
right now he's got a title that let's
just be completely honest about what it

661
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:59,070
is.
It's not a title that he beat the

662
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:02,340
champion to get sure he had to take it
away from the champion.

663
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,580
And the public recognizes that and while
John Jones may be screwing up a lot,

664
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,570
he may have all these problems outside
of the octagon,

665
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,750
inside the octagon and no one has been
able to best him.

666
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,400
He's amazing.
And because of that,

667
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,880
because of that,
people are on his side because people

668
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,350
love winners.
They just do,

669
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:25,170
they love Mike Tyson when he was in his
prime and you know,

670
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:28,050
even when he came out of jail for
alleged rape,

671
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,100
he claims he never did it.

672
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,990
I don't know what happened obviously.
Um,

673
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,990
but when he came out of jail,
they were still rooting for him.

674
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,130
I mean,
here's a guy who,

675
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,840
if you have daughters,
I have daughters,

676
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,150
you know,
if you have a girl and you hope,

677
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,310
boy,
the worst case scenario is my,

678
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,870
my daughter finds herself in a position
where a man wants to physically do

679
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,630
something to her that she doesn't want.
People didn't give a fuck.

680
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,800
They were like Mike Tyson's back back
and he's still looking angry and he's

681
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,210
rip now.
He's been doing prison workouts and

682
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,910
there's something about a guy who's just
a bad motherfucker that people love.

683
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,530
Yeah,
and there's a.

684
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:05,790
there's a thing where they know that
Daniel feels that there's a thing where

685
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:10,791
they know that Daniel knows that John is
the guy who won the first fight,

686
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,560
that John is the legitimate linear
champion.

687
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,360
That John is the undefeated fighter and
literally the only undefeated fighter at

688
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:19,560
that level.
There's no one.

689
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,130
I mean he has one loss to Matt Hamill,
which is a bullshit disqualification

690
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:26,160
from a dumb fucking rule which said a
million times.

691
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,010
Nobody's more angry about that.
Then you,

692
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,700
Jon Jones is not as frustrated about
that loss issue.

693
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,290
Our madness.
It's the law,

694
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,540
the law.
The rule is madness and it only exists.

695
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,010
I talked to big John Mccarthy about this
extensively only exists because the

696
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,310
commission was ignorant.
Sure.

697
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,180
They didn't understand that those bricks
breakers,

698
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,570
it's not that hard to break a fucking
brick man.

699
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,710
Seems crazy,
but it's really just not.

700
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,840
Especially when they are spread wide
like that.

701
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,270
But John Jones has that aura of
invincibility about him.

702
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:57,600
Now,
if he fought rumble,

703
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:00,390
Johnson rumble,
Johnson head kicked him into oblivion

704
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,730
and we see John was toes curled,
you know,

705
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:06,660
lying on his back,
snoring which absolutely can happen to

706
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,494
any human.

707
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,890
Then the whole thing would change and I
think the walls would come crumbling

708
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:14,220
down and if John did a press conference
and said he was 30 days sober,

709
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,990
they will start booing them.
They wouldn't give a fuck.

710
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,880
I think that's fair.
Yeah,

711
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,530
you're right.
America does love success.

712
00:29:19,531 --> 00:29:21,360
Fans are front runners.
They've got the right to be,

713
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:22,920
but yeah,
historically that is how it worked and

714
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:25,170
we're talking about rumble Johnson and
John Jones.

715
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,550
Man,
we got to get that match up.

716
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,380
We fuck they fucked up.
I mean,

717
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,420
the whole thing is fucked up and that in
that,

718
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,190
that hasn't happened because he's in
real danger with clover like that.

719
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,370
That air of invincibility was taken away
from him by,

720
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,160
by um,
Daniel Daniel beat him and he broke

721
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,520
Daniel,
beat him down,

722
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,790
took his back and choked him and you
could see rumble,

723
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,270
just having a real hard time with the,
what was going on in that fight.

724
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,990
He had given his all and that first
round he had hit danny with a bomb,

725
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,410
like literally took him off of his feet,
sent him flying across the octagon.

726
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,080
But Daniel is tough as fuck.
And he survived.

727
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:03,670
He gutted it out and then he imposed his
superior wrestling and wound up winning.

728
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,970
So we lost a lot there because that
fight was supposed to be Jon Jones and

729
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:12,510
Rumble Johnson.
And then Jon Jones Rumble Johnson would

730
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:15,730
have been fucking epic.
That would've been really interesting to

731
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,410
see what happens when a guy who hits
like rumble connects with a guy like

732
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,220
John.
And especially back then when we didn't

733
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,750
know what would happen,
we know that Josh Koscheck had beaten

734
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:27,940
him,
that he had real hard time in the later

735
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:31,990
rounds when he was competing at one 70.
But we also knew that there's no fucking

736
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:35,380
way you should have been at one 70 even
when fall [inaudible] 85.

737
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,260
It was kind of the same thing.
He came out like a bat out of hell and

738
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:41,410
then faded.
And then we assumed that he also missed

739
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:44,060
one 85 against veto by seven pounds.
Yeah,

740
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,540
I mean he had a notorious problem with
his weight.

741
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,750
So we kind of attributed a lot of his
failures to that.

742
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,890
And we see him at heavyweight beat the
shit out of our lawsky break as John the

743
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:55,690
first round,
just Tulum for three.

744
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,501
And we say,
well,

745
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,610
okay,
well rumble at two.

746
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:59,980
Oh five is the fucking man.
We missed that.

747
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,300
Ms Dot opportunities.

748
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,081
Yeah,
I agree.

749
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:02,740
And you know,
when you,

750
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,720
when you bring up Rumble Rashad who
trained with both John Jones and rob

751
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,690
says,
rumbled beats him.

752
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,810
Now rumble only does have one problem.
He is a front runner.

753
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:13,690
He does fade a little bit,
but that's a big storm that he brings,

754
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:15,370
you know,
rda fights that way.

755
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,630
He started Amanda Nunez fights that way.
Her own teammates.

756
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:19,151
We're saying,
look,

757
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:20,500
if she gets into the second,
third round,

758
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:22,750
I don't know about this,
but she's going to bring a storm in that

759
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:26,020
first round Ou and I don't think Misha
can survive it.

760
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:28,480
I talked to Dustin Porsche,
he trains with Amanda and he said that

761
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:29,314
he goes,
well,

762
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,670
if it gets into the later round,
she,

763
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,070
you know,
her percentage goes down.

764
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,640
He said,
but I think he or she's going to come

765
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,960
out and she's going to put her foot on
the gas,

766
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:35,920
empty the tank.
And the first,

767
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,800
I don't think she's going to be around.
And he's right.

768
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,060
Isn't that fascinating?
Those fast twitch muscle fiber fighters,

769
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,820
those ones who explode,
the really dynamic ones,

770
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,790
there's a,
there's a fucking given a take to

771
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:47,690
everything.
Sure.

772
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,010
And those,
those ones,

773
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:52,100
they just don't survive into the third,
fourth and fifth round with the same

774
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:52,660
pep.

775
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,890
So.
So let's back up.

776
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,900
I made a note here on that Jon Jones
thing.

777
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,530
Did you follow the whole johnstones
drama and the most recent one?

778
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,030
The only post drama?
Yeah.

779
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,400
Was that he had a press conference the
next day.

780
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,040
Did you follow that press conference at
all?

781
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,800
I saw the crying pictures of Jamie sent
them to me.

782
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,060
I went to that press conference and
there was a couple of takeaways,

783
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,500
and this is all speculative,
but for this doesn't make John innocent

784
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,250
at all.
Well,

785
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,270
John's guilty.
They've got,

786
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,410
they've got the stamp.
Let's guilty,

787
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:22,360
but his actions were not that of a
guilty man.

788
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,060
Historically,
guilty guys go bury their head in the

789
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:26,680
sand.
They tried out run this thing.

790
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,510
They get with their legal teams.
They show up at the hearing.

791
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,460
They hope for the worst,
for the best.

792
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:31,720
They get the worst and they deal with
it.

793
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,900
John face the music.
Twelve hours later he came through the

794
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:37,510
hotel.
His whole life's pulling apart right

795
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,140
now.
I imagine he didn't even sleep that

796
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,580
night.
He comes to the hotel with the fans.

797
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,580
He comes into the media pr one.
One says,

798
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:48,581
you read a script that was written for
you and you exit the stage instead.

799
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,230
He read no script,
he took every question asked of him,

800
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,480
and that's just not what a guilty guy
does.

801
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:56,200
Not understand that he's guilty in terms
of data,

802
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,220
but what we care about,
his intent was he trying to get over on

803
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:02,710
somebody,
was he trying to hide something?

804
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,490
His actions would represent that he did
it,

805
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:06,080
but here's the problem with the press
conference,

806
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:08,210
Joe,
when you hold a press conference,

807
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,090
you have,
you have one goal in mind which is to

808
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:14,300
win over the media and that they say
nice things about you before you do go

809
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:15,890
home and bury your head in the sand.

810
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,260
Secondly,
you want to break something.

811
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,870
You want to get something out there to
get ahead of the store.

812
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,700
That's the whole reason you show up at
these things.

813
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,530
The only car that he had to play is what
did you test positive for?

814
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,790
That was the only thing we didn't know
and they refuse to reveal it so that

815
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:36,140
that was a little bit weird and where I
was sitting because I've been in John

816
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,510
spot in here was the thing that happened
with me.

817
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,400
We're,
we're talking about John,

818
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:44,600
this whole thing is going on with John
based on a test that took place on June

819
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:47,450
16th.
The reason that relevant when I went

820
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:50,920
through my thing,
I was he tested positive for semesters

821
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:53,150
in blockers.
Those don't really have anything to do

822
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,280
with anything.
They don't help you.

823
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,650
They're silly.
I think you might've just revealed

824
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:58,040
something.

825
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,500
Yeah.
He tested positive for two estrogen.

826
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,020
No one else knew that.
There you go.

827
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,680
I'm revealing.
You broke personal information.

828
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,120
That's what we're doing here though.
Right?

829
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,040
Wow.
But this is like,

830
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,200
this is like the only way that anybody
could find that out is if you talked

831
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,910
about it.
Boom.

832
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,840
It's out there.
Right.

833
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:16,010
And that we're doing here,
aren't we?

834
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,560
Creating some news.
It's a big news day,

835
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,230
but let's say,
but here's The relevance and let me tie

836
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,060
myself into this.
When I went through this job,

837
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,010
I had something selling in there.
In fact,

838
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,830
I had an estrogen blocker.
I have something silly in there and

839
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,150
everybody forgave.
I was.

840
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,100
I was going to be suspended,
but fox,

841
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,850
every I was fine.
Everybody looked good.

842
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,291
Okay.
Well,

843
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,760
you know,
we changed the rules in the test and

844
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,380
everything was fine,
but what I had to live with,

845
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,370
what only I knew there was another test
out there,

846
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,190
but the results hadn't come back yet and
I didn't know what that test was going

847
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:44,450
to show.

848
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,270
I know what it could have shown.
I know what it should have shown,

849
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:48,680
but I know what the other test could
have been,

850
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,110
should have as well.
So you're sitting there hoping,

851
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:53,540
how good is this damn test?
That's all you're thinking about.

852
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:53,960
Well,
we,

853
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,310
you and I had a conversation.
You're the guy called you on stage and

854
00:34:58,311 --> 00:34:59,390
I'm blowing you up.
You're like,

855
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,620
hey man,
I'm doing a show.

856
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:04,640
Can I call you tomorrow tonight?
I will stay in capital letters tonight.

857
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,790
I need to hear from you tonight.
Yeah,

858
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,480
I remember the exact words.
He said,

859
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,231
well,
you know,

860
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:12,950
we were wondering how stringent these
new tests are.

861
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,710
Turns out they're really good.
Turns out it's a pretty good test.

862
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,520
Turns out it's not like the old,
a one,

863
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:21,860
800 requests a test that costs $99.
Okay.

864
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:24,470
There's a reason this ca,
this test is 40 plus grand,

865
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,440
but the thing that I'm,
I'm,

866
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:29,720
I'm wondering,
does John have another test out there?

867
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,310
If he does it doesn't mean it's going to
come back,

868
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,390
but that was the same spot I was in.
There was a shoe that could drop for me.

869
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:36,980
It did for him.
Is there another test out there?

870
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,070
And if there's not,
the facade

871
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,430
has got some explaining to do.
If you're telling me a guy that's got a

872
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,090
track record,
the tested positive for cocaine going to

873
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,860
fight in the biggest fight of his career
and the last time you tested them was

874
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:48,420
one month before the bout.
Then it was.

875
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,930
Sod has got some explaining to do,
but there's more to the story now.

876
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:53,610
What do we hear it?
Does he pass his,

877
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,930
the end up in the spot?
I don't know,

878
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:57,000
but that's,
that's the piece that's still missing.

879
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,240
Well,
there's one aspect to his,

880
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,850
uh,
test is positive test that people are

881
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,030
saying could possibly play a factor and
it's a supplements that he could

882
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:12,160
possibly have been taking something that
like,

883
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,110
this is what happened to 10 means this
is what happened to um,

884
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,100
allow Ramiro where they get a supplement
and it says it has a bunch of stuff on

885
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:21,810
it says you look through the
ingredients.

886
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:23,390
Okay.
Creatine [inaudible],

887
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,330
we're good,
we're good.

888
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,630
But then when you run it through a lab,
it turns out there's a bunch of other

889
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:31,530
stuff in there too and that's why it's
so effective and that's why it sells.

890
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,380
So it is possible that that could be the
case.

891
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,120
We don't know yet because then if that's
the case then John has to give them all

892
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:42,330
the supplements that he was taking and
then they have to go to a store,

893
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,300
buy them independently,
test them and verify that these

894
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:47,140
ingredients were in not just the
bachelor,

895
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:49,620
the hands them,
but also in other batches.

896
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:51,750
So it's not like he doctor did show some
stuff in there.

897
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,840
Sure.
But estrogen blockers are usually when

898
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,550
people are getting off of steroids,

899
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,230
right?
When you're coming off a cycle,

900
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,580
it's a blocker.
You know,

901
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:01,770
men don't want estrogen anyway,
but it's a blocker.

902
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:04,200
It's not going to.
So as far as that substance goes,

903
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:06,150
and that's all that's all he's going to
have to live with.

904
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:09,510
You're not going to have to explain how
they work for someone who doesn't

905
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:13,240
understand what an estrogen blocker will
do if you up your testosterone than your

906
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,930
estrogens has naturally ups.
And guys don't want estrogen.

907
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:16,764
So if you're a guy,
you,

908
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,370
you take a blocker that can block that,
bring it to you,

909
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,830
you won't get a,
you know,

910
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,820
I'm trying to think of a word Guy Gasta.
I can't even.

911
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,930
I can't bitch.
Tits is all that comes to mind.

912
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:30,030
I can't think of the word guy.
I'm a guy.

913
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm more closed.
Guy Got a go.

914
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,190
At any rate,
it can stop some of those things.

915
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:38,670
So that's the speculation.
And the reason that that's on the list

916
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:41,430
is they find that that's a way they can
catch you after the fact,

917
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,600
Hey,
if we missed you during this cycle,

918
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:43,434
we can catch you here.

919
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,390
Well,
it's not just that.

920
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,100
The reason why they take it after the
cycle is because you get hypogonadism,

921
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:49,530
your,
your,

922
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,720
your body stops producing testosterone
because you took exoticness

923
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,980
testosterone.
That's right.

924
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,540
And so the.
To restart it,

925
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,630
they'd take this stuff,
these estrogen blockers.

926
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,623
That's right.
Yeah.

927
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,480
I tested positive for an estrogen
blocker and it was that exact thing.

928
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,830
Same thing.
They banned testosterone.

929
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:09,360
I went on something called Hcg.
She'll return your testes back on and

930
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:13,020
then you have to clomiphene,
which is by definition an estrogen

931
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:16,440
blocker for that same thing,
but it can also help get your body going

932
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,450
back on testosterone.
So they're band.

933
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,890
John's got a problem,
and again,

934
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:21,720
this goes back to the press conference.
He said,

935
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:25,770
I have not taken anything new that I
have not taken my entire career.

936
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,840
So somebody gave him a follow up
question.

937
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:29,880
He quickly realized what he just said.
And he goes,

938
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:31,860
wow,
I do have a new supplement company.

939
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:35,040
I have taken some new supplements.
So he realized,

940
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,030
put himself in one point needed to get
out of it.

941
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,020
The supplement company then who dropped
him immediately came out with a press

942
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:42,790
release that do not put this on us.

943
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,730
We don't have anything to do with that
and we'll turn over any samples you want

944
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:48,040
so that that's.
That's the downside to holding a press

945
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:50,530
conference is if there's anything that
commission hates,

946
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,840
it's when somebody isn't honest with
them.

947
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:54,580
Well,
if there's anything who a hates and it's

948
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:59,581
with Lance Armstrong found out it's when
you deny the scientific accuracy of

949
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:03,370
their test,
that's the risk with holding a press

950
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:06,070
conference.
That's why most legal teams will tell

951
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,240
you,
go home,

952
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,880
be quiet,
rewrite right to remain silent,

953
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,040
execute that.
Show up at your hearing date,

954
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,480
gets sworn in,
say your piece,

955
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:13,910
and then go ahead

956
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:18,110
about your life.
How does John not have a trusted

957
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:22,070
handler?
How does John not have someone who

958
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,820
realizes that you don't just have like
a,

959
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,220
a,
a high level athlete?

960
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,550
You have arguably the greatest light
heavyweight of all time,

961
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,960
who has not,
in my opinion,

962
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:37,100
reached its potential yet I think John
has massive potential outside of what

963
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:40,610
he's actually shown because when he
moved to Albuquerque and we saw that he

964
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,760
was training all the time and we saw the
most recent footage before he fought

965
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:47,600
over in St prue waste power lifting.
He looks fucking huge.

966
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,640
He's dedicated.
His eating clean.

967
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:52,490
He's making these instagram videos of
all this healthy food he's eating.

968
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,400
We're assuming he's getting the proper
rest.

969
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,480
All the other things we're assuming,
get the wild man.

970
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:58,310
Days are gone.
He's still got the wild man's mind,

971
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,760
but now he's gonna approach this like a
real competitive athlete.

972
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:06,350
Here's my question to you.
When someone is wild and talented and

973
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:09,110
impulsive,
just a wild motherfucker like Jon Jones

974
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:11,490
is.
Is it even smart terrain,

975
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,750
that guy in Ken,
how can it affect him?

976
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,660
I mean,
is it a positive thing to read them in

977
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,870
or is part of what he is and why he's so
good and why he's willing to open with a

978
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:27,800
flying knee on a shogun was the first
fight.

979
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,260
The first fight for a title,
what was he?

980
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,970
Twenty three,
24,

981
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,940
20.
He opens up with a flying knee on,

982
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,010
you know,
one of the legends of MMA,

983
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,040
former pride champion or fry pride,
a Grand Prix tramp champion and UFC

984
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,320
champion as well.
You'll,

985
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,230
you'll look at a guy like John in the.
The way he competes in the way he's.

986
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,710
He's so creative and wild in there and
impulsive.

987
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,620
It's almost like that's a part of his
success.

988
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,240
I fully agree.
And historically I could bring up

989
00:40:57,241 --> 00:41:00,180
athletes where that is true or they go
sober where they go straight and narrow

990
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:02,730
when they find God,
whatever these things are in,

991
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:07,050
they changed something that yeah,
the dominoes start to fall.

992
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,420
The problem is when you've got a wild
man like John,

993
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,420
he's in a box and it's a loose box and
he's having some fights,

994
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,670
but usually that continues to escalate
so he kinda needs to keep himself right

995
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:21,120
in that framework.
And the bad news is it usually just

996
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:23,400
keeps get.
It just usually just keeps pushing.

997
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:25,380
So that's a very important.
That becomes a problem.

998
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:25,660
That's

999
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,840
a very important point where people
escalate things like billionaires want

1000
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:29,860
more billions,
right?

1001
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,070
They want islands now.
They want fucking jets and spaceships

1002
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,120
and with

1003
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,330
a pro athlete or a wild person who's
doing crazy shit,

1004
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,840
they want to do more crazy shit.
They want to drive 150 miles an hour.

1005
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,550
They want a man,
but it just seems like whatever the fuck

1006
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:49,190
you do,
nerf everything around him,

1007
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,380
you know,
by up the town.

1008
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,820
Fucking have three guys that he trusts,
followed him around everywhere and make

1009
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,890
sure that he doesn't eat anything that
he's not supposed to eat.

1010
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,930
Don't take any pills you're not supposed
to take.

1011
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,030
Don't.
Most of us don't drive.

1012
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,300
I mean that was his biggest problem was
getting behind the wheel in front of

1013
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:06,770
everything else he was doing was like,
John,

1014
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,470
you gotta get you gotTa.
Get a chauffer,

1015
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,040
you got to get uber.
You can take a taxi.

1016
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,160
Don't get behind the wheel.
That was the most of his problems.

1017
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:15,110
He had some other ones,
but that was the most of it.

1018
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,330
If you just took him out of the driver's
seat.

1019
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,340
A lot of this doesn't exist.
Yeah,

1020
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:22,370
a lot of it doesn't exist,
but this most recent one obviously does

1021
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,750
and the like.
Yeah.

1022
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:26,690
He had those.
The two major car accidents,

1023
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:31,691
we had that beautiful Bentley and slid
it into a tree and then obviously the

1024
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,520
one where he crashed and that woman and
left the scene of the crime,

1025
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:37,520
which was horrendous.
He survived that though.

1026
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,700
You know,
he vibe that he came back and the urban

1027
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,030
st prue fight.
He Won.

1028
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,710
They beat a top six guy on short notice
and then this happens.

1029
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,130
And to get positive on something as
small and innocuous as estrogen

1030
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:53,410
blockers.
Yeah,

1031
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,250
I agree.
So you go back to that open state

1032
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,160
approved fight,
single worst performances of a

1033
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:02,090
performance of John's career,
single worst by light years.

1034
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,650
They.
You break it down a little further.

1035
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,230
He won the grappling,
he won the striking.

1036
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,620
He won every round.
He did it.

1037
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,570
He did it back off.
You didn't get tired.

1038
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:11,000
He was stronger.
And that was on a bad day.

1039
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,770
I didn't think it was a bad fight.
I,

1040
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:14,300
you know,
everyone says the single worst

1041
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:17,960
performance.
I have a great deal of respect for St

1042
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,920
prue and I think [inaudible] is a very
dangerous guy.

1043
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,060
He's very explosive.
His left power kick is extremely strong.

1044
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,930
He has a nasty left hook.
He's a southpaw and he fights odd.

1045
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:33,460
He has a very odd style.
I would agree about opens.

1046
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,230
I think your assessment there is fair
and I think his stock went up that

1047
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:37,280
night,
but when I'm watching John,

1048
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:37,791
I'm going,
okay,

1049
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,650
this isn't that.
This is a rusty John.

1050
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,780
This is slow or the outputs a little bit
down.

1051
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,590
The bottom line is on a bad day,
he left with a world championship on a

1052
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:45,740
bed.

1053
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,320
That's how good he is.
The other side of John,

1054
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,200
you know when you're talking about the
car wrecks or one more time about the

1055
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,880
cocaine or what he's going through now,
and again,

1056
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,440
this was my takeaway from the press
conference.

1057
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,120
The biggest takeaway was John won't own
anything and it's like John,

1058
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:02,060
at some point you can't do the routine
about.

1059
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,070
I don't know why God put me in this
spot.

1060
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:06,320
This is,
I don't know why God put me in the spot.

1061
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:08,360
Everything happens for a reason.
I'm going to come out better.

1062
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:09,470
On the other side,
it's like John,

1063
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,370
you're acting like you got diagnosed
with diabetes or cancer or something.

1064
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:15,650
You know that you're the victim.
You weren't a hit and run.

1065
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:17,240
You did the hidden and you did the
running.

1066
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:19,250
That was your fault on the cocaine
thing.

1067
00:44:19,251 --> 00:44:20,850
You didn't say,
somebody slipped me a mickey.

1068
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,330
You said I was at a party in Brazil,
a rolled up 100 and went down to the

1069
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:24,350
tip.
That was your fault.

1070
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,200
Now you're in a jam here for two banned
substance in.

1071
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,980
You're still not taking response and you
think God's put you in this spot.

1072
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,940
It's like John said,
you put yourself in this spot and at

1073
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:35,130
some point if you're the baddest dude in
the world and you are,

1074
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,100
you gotta man up on these things,
you got to man up and go,

1075
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:39,930
Hey,
I'm guilty and I how exactly it

1076
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:41,640
happened.
I'm going to try to figure that out,

1077
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,130
but I'm definitely guilty of Sada does a
good job.

1078
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:46,320
I trust those labs.
Let's get to the bottom of the jail.

1079
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:49,590
Son In public relations is what we need.
We need a need,

1080
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,960
a little earpiece.
You put in John Jones ear,

1081
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,430
you sit behind the screens.

1082
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,030
You have a monitor here you go.
No,

1083
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:55,331
no,
no,

1084
00:44:55,331 --> 00:44:55,681
no,
no.

1085
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:56,730
John,
this is not.

1086
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,920
Just stop.
Stop right there.

1087
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,260
But no more victim.
No more victim role.

1088
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,170
You stand up like Tony Montana and that
fucking restaurant.

1089
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,840
You're looking at the bad guy there.
Say Hello.

1090
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,020
There it is through her bag guy.
Yeah,

1091
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:11,220
I like to party.
Bitch,

1092
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,720
I fucked up.
I took some shit.

1093
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,620
What?
So what supplements would have

1094
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,710
testosterone blockers or estrogen
blockers excuse,

1095
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:21,940
but none that I've ever heard of.
And again,

1096
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:23,163
but,
but if you're there,

1097
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,760
but if they boost testosterone,
estrogen blockers,

1098
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,390
apparently the is more of an effect of
testosterone.

1099
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:32,250
How's it work?
I've never heard that.

1100
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:33,180
No,
that could be true.

1101
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,020
I think of myself as kind of an expert
in this field from being on the wrong

1102
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:38,640
side,
but on both sides of it.

1103
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:39,500
But,
uh,

1104
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,010
I've never heard of that.

1105
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,840
I can't imagine why supplement company
would do that.

1106
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:46,470
And this supplement company wasn't like
Tim means it's company or Yo El Ramirez,

1107
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:48,660
they came out with a press release
instantly,

1108
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,870
so do not put this on us.
Let us know what you need from us.

1109
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:54,240
We'll drop it off at the lab ourselves.
Jamie,

1110
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:58,110
see if you find this online because
someone told me about it this weekend

1111
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:01,410
and I never got a chance to look at.
Someone said that there are certain

1112
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:06,411
things in supplements that you know
could have been sold by a company that

1113
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,310
would allow you to test positive for
these very things.

1114
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,690
See if.
See if you could find that in,

1115
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,580
in relationship to John Jones is test
because I remember someone talking about

1116
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:19,410
it and I said I gotta remember to look
this up.

1117
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,550
What it's owned there.
Only those two chemicals.

1118
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,580
The only exists like in a pharmaceutical
world,

1119
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:26,930
right?

1120
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:27,763
Yeah,
that's right.

1121
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,310
So it's not like it's a root or
something and you know.

1122
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,140
And then what exactly they got upon me
that that's still coming out.

1123
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:35,280
But that was one of the things,
again,

1124
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:37,140
to go back to the press conference and I
think,

1125
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,260
I think John did more good than he did.
I think it was kind of a good thing that

1126
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:41,370
he came out.
He showed courage.

1127
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:42,990
He didn't read the script,
he answered all the questions,

1128
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,000
but the bad was he didn't tell us what
he tested positive for the bad news.

1129
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,240
Now we stuck with speculation.
If he wouldn't come out and tell us

1130
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,350
exactly what it was,
you and I wouldn't have to gas and go to

1131
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,840
the Internet and Springfield and
speculate and rumors is which.

1132
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,380
Which you don't need.
I don't know why he held that with

1133
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,550
understanding who god is going to tell
us.

1134
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,000
Tell us.
I don't think they know.

1135
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,541
No,
I don't.

1136
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,850
I really.
I think if they're gonna charge him and

1137
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:08,640
they keep getting sued,
have they're going to charge them and

1138
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:10,040
they are within the.
Oh,

1139
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,620
that I'm going for breaking one year.
Like medical information.

1140
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:16,050
You'll take it out of it's medical
information.

1141
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,330
I suppose you're right with Hipaa,
but this doesn't fall under that.

1142
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,770
The commission's going to bring charges
against him for certain supplements.

1143
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:24,660
They're going to bring him in,
require that he's there,

1144
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,510
they're going to have to address it.
Then he's going to say his piece.

1145
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,141
Look,
I took this.

1146
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:29,980
I didn't think I'd get caught or I don't
know anything

1147
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,670
about it.
That's.

1148
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,140
That's a route.
Guys go as well,

1149
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,970
but the bottom line is it's going to
come out.

1150
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:38,320
I thought he had a good opportunity to
tell us what it was and perhaps give a

1151
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:41,260
guess as to how it got an assistant.
If he is going to take that path.

1152
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,410
The outright denial path.
That's not a great one historically,

1153
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,510
but some guys taking,
if that's the route,

1154
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:49,630
he's going to go to an outright denial.
Tell us what it is.

1155
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,620
Oh yeah.
Here we go.

1156
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,440
Go

1157
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,330
a substance tests warning.
Bodybuilders and other athletes objected

1158
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,780
to substance testing should never use
this product unless first approved by

1159
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,900
the validating organization product may
cause a drug test result called false

1160
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,630
positive urine or blood.
What does.

1161
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,010
What is this stuff?
Oh,

1162
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:10,780
is this the company that John Uses?
Oh Shit,

1163
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,993
guys.
Clean.

1164
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,190
Second.
Second is taken to just keep the fucking

1165
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:20,890
guy.
Oh my God.

1166
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:26,100
This is hilarious.
When you go to this gap website and you

1167
00:48:26,631 --> 00:48:28,570
know,
I don't know what's in there.

1168
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:32,890
I don't know if this is a good company.
I know nothing other than what I'm

1169
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:35,620
seeing right now.
You're looking at a guy in their photos

1170
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:40,621
that's fucking clearly on steroids.
Fucking clearly test digit.

1171
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,440
He's not testing.
If that's it right there,

1172
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:48,400
Jack Guy,
that massive mountain of muscle is not

1173
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:50,530
on steroids.
Send me that shit.

1174
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,840
Send it to me.
Box it up.

1175
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,720
I'll fucking.
I'll promote it for a month for free.

1176
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,970
If you can get that guy to look like
that and test or test negative like that

1177
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:05,930
guy's not on Anna.
Draw 50 and fucking tests.

1178
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,440
SIP,
sip innate and every other fucking thing

1179
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:12,220
in the book and gorilla come and
whatever the fuck he's on.

1180
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,030
That's a whole that you should not like.
I hate to be the guy.

1181
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,770
Why?
Why is the white guy so skinny in the

1182
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:18,850
background?
Look at that photo again.

1183
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,650
I looked at Greg Jackson's brother a
little bit.

1184
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:23,740
Doesn't mean what's that white guy doing
in the background like that white guy

1185
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:27,870
has a skinny neck and you know,
it was it kind of traps or he's flexing

1186
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:30,660
them but they're not really that
impressive and he's in the back like

1187
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,520
looking at this black guy.
This is like some cuckold type shit.

1188
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,593
That's what this is.

1189
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,290
This black guy just doing curls and he's
about to fuck the shit out of his girl

1190
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,840
and the other guy is like looking
through the curtain like man,

1191
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:43,450
I don't even know what to do here.
Like look at his face.

1192
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:46,120
He's not lifting.
What is that guy doing in the back?

1193
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:49,600
He's got like minimal chest development.
He looks Kinda scrawny.

1194
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,940
I would suspect you have something to do
with the company or his father does a.

1195
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,560
that's generally how these things work
out at the bizarre.

1196
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:58,720
That's a book that is,
that's a bizarre choice.

1197
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,320
Like why is that distracting guy over
that gentleman shoulder?

1198
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,910
Like one guy's looking at me like,
fucking look,

1199
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,520
I'm good and boog got shoot is working
good man.

1200
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,450
I'm getting big Bro on clean.
I've got a dog tag on.

1201
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:16,450
Probably never been in the military,
just sort of look to wear dog tags that

1202
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:21,451
are going to war.
That's like a dog tag with like,

1203
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,560
it's like be dazzled.
See it's got like tuning.

1204
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,670
Not I see has got legs on the outside
edge of it.

1205
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:30,800
It's Kinda like a little fucking
rhinestones and shit.

1206
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,000
It's a black dog tag too.
It's not even a real dog tag is what?

1207
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,400
This is a weird fucking photo shoot.

1208
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,020
I don't understand it.
So there it is.

1209
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,060
So there are directions for tested
testogenix let's,

1210
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:46,460
let's go to that directions.
I want to find out what I'm supposed to

1211
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:49,460
do to get like that guy.
Is this the company that John's.

1212
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:50,810
Whether this is just what we brought up.
Oh,

1213
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:54,400
this is just the company on training and
non training days.

1214
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,620
A dietary supplement take two to three
tablets with breakfast and the other two

1215
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:01,130
to three tablets with lunch every day
after six weeks of continual use.

1216
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:03,650
One month break is recommended.
So it's a cycle.

1217
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:04,580
It's this test.
Okay.

1218
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:05,710
Let's.
What are the ingredients?

1219
00:51:05,711 --> 00:51:08,480
Let's go all the way up.
What do we got here?

1220
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,360
Hm.
Vitamin E,

1221
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:12,350
vitamin B,
six,

1222
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:13,430
magnesium,
zinc,

1223
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:15,980
selenium,
chromium tested gin,

1224
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:17,390
mass.
Strength and size.

1225
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:20,240
Formula Three,
b hydroxy five.

1226
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,930
And Dro Sten Sten Not Steve [inaudible].
Seventeen one.

1227
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,900
Okay,
a three.

1228
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:29,590
One H indol three.

1229
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,703
Okay.
Yeah,

1230
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:35,770
these are tricky little things.
Beta sit toll sterl from solely other

1231
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:37,910
vegetable oils.
Okay.

1232
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:39,850
I don't know why I've told me that.
Uh,

1233
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,820
I provide a bunch of bullshit after
that.

1234
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,440
They always throw.
I'll go wild.

1235
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,140
Yam Root Twenty five milligrams.
That's nonsense.

1236
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,080
Wild yams or where they get testosterone
from,

1237
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,590
they actually extract testosterone.
They make it out of wild yams.

1238
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:59,480
So like when a company throws in like 25
milligrams of Wild Yam,

1239
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,990
what are you doing?
Like you just trying to pretend that

1240
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,410
that's,
that's significant.

1241
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,340
Your Wild Yam root.
A lot of goofy stuff in here.

1242
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,620
Ginseng extract.
Why do you have Jensen?

1243
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:11,570
Yeah.
Well come on.

1244
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:12,710
He's not taking.
What do you think?

1245
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:14,270
Challenge,
jealous was waking up and taking this

1246
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,104
stuff.
Why not?

1247
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,250
If it's.
If it doesn't,

1248
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,700
if Beta alanine works,
it's got 500 milligrams of Beta alanine.

1249
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,780
That stuff's legit.

1250
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,140
I mean a mute me.
How do you say it?

1251
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,230
Mucuna parenthesis,
pure insists is extract that's been

1252
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:30,800
known to boost a human growth hormone,
I believe,

1253
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,610
but I'm looking at all this stuff that
he's doing.

1254
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:37,220
I might be wrong about that.
I don't even know how to say that word.

1255
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,880
I don't even know if he was officially
taking this particular supplement.

1256
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:41,780
I just,
when I googled,

1257
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,010
uh,
that company and just say this is the

1258
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,220
first one that came,
of course,

1259
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:47,390
right?
Yeah.

1260
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:49,790
So this is just by that company we don't
know,

1261
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,070
but none of these things are estrogen
blockers,

1262
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,450
so it doesn't make sense unless he got a
tainted supplement,

1263
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,180
which again,
and this is not the fault of the

1264
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:02,060
company,
happens all the time because the way a

1265
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,570
supplement company works,
like say if you wanted to buy a creatine

1266
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:09,650
or something from a company,
you buy it in bulk from a supplier and

1267
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:12,650
that supplier,
you might be in China or who knows

1268
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:15,110
where,
and they mix these things up and they

1269
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:19,550
use the same Vat.
Like that was the Anderson Silva Story.

1270
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:24,500
That was his alibi,
was that he was buying liquid cialis and

1271
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:29,501
he was buying from a company that also
sold steroids and apparently according

1272
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:33,570
to people that know him,
that is actually what happened,

1273
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,100
which sounds crazy.

1274
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,080
Very well.
And he and he had three.

1275
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,090
He had three.
He tests positive for three things.

1276
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,170
So maybe that knocks one off the list,
but yeah,

1277
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,280
I hear you.
There is some confusion there.

1278
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

1279
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,790
I mean that story is bs,
but I hear what you're saying.

1280
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,380
There is,
there is confusion in there.

1281
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:51,420
Tim Means was innocent 100 percent.
Yeah.

1282
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:53,760
And Yoel Romero.
And they ruled that.

1283
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:55,340
That's not my opinion.
They ruled the World

1284
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,310
Ramiro.
I mean,

1285
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:58,920
you want to talk about not passing the
smell test.

1286
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:04,360
That guy is a goddamn freak of nature.
I've never seen a guy he out of all the

1287
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:06,930
other freaks,
he makes the other freaks look.

1288
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,480
Sure.
And Frank Mir appear.

1289
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:11,730
That's a,
that's a weird one to even their own

1290
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:14,100
science.
They're confused on Frank Mirs because

1291
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:16,750
there's metabolites were so low where
they're going,

1292
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:17,041
what?
Look,

1293
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:18,450
you passed here,
you passed here,

1294
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:21,390
but you did it here.
For your metabolites to be this low,

1295
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,940
you would have had to have taken it six
weeks before,

1296
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:25,000
but we tested you.
They're there.

1297
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,300
They are even confused on their science.
They're,

1298
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:29,310
they've,
they've admitted that they go at the

1299
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:30,780
shows up.
We got to do something with it,

1300
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:33,690
but we don't.
We don't understand how you had this

1301
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:36,330
reading and frankly I'll tell you
everything I did.

1302
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:38,040
I'll tell you everything I ate.
I don't.

1303
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,470
I don't know how this works.
You give me the answer and they're even

1304
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:41,850
confused themselves.
Go ahead.

1305
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,990
This,
this shouldn't be.

1306
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,550
It is.
We've got to deal with it,

1307
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:46,440
but it take the supplements,
the test,

1308
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:47,274
the things that he's.

1309
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,830
Frank hadn't taken any supplements.
That was the other thing he said he

1310
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:51,330
fought in some,
some different country.

1311
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:51,840
He goes,
look,

1312
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,720
and everybody made fun of him for this,
but he was just being honest,

1313
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,910
catering and he knows how he said that
he now that the headlights made them

1314
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:01,680
look bad,
but frank was just being Kennedy because

1315
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:02,760
look,
the only thing I've done different.

1316
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,220
I was in this different country,
some kangaroo meat for the first time.

1317
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,370
Everyone teased him,
but he's going to ask me.

1318
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,330
They asked me,
have you done anything different with

1319
00:55:10,331 --> 00:55:12,450
the IOC is telling athletes we're food

1320
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,760
in certain parts of the world in China
and in Russia in particular to not eat

1321
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:20,270
the meat because if you eat the meat you
could potentially test positive.

1322
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,080
Right.
Depending on when it came it.

1323
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:25,110
So frank offering them that was just,
you know,

1324
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:27,450
he got teased for it,
but he was just being candid.

1325
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:28,820
He might be right.
Yeah.

1326
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,870
I mean he,
he might've got some unscrupulous

1327
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:31,930
kangaroo meat.
Yeah.

1328
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,710
And Frank's always been an open guy.
He was on testosterone.

1329
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:36,870
He wasn't one of the guys that tried to
hide it like the other guys.

1330
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:38,210
He went and asked for the tea.
Frank.

1331
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,190
So a pretty straight up guy.
He's an open book and it's not all great

1332
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:41,821
stuff.
I mean,

1333
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:44,880
he'll tell you this.
I'll tell you what frank says.

1334
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:45,570
I didn't.
I tend,

1335
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,403
I believe him.

1336
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,041
Yeah,
I do.

1337
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,080
I do as well.
Yeah.

1338
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:51,020
He's just an.
He has also a career of being straight

1339
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:53,840
up to start being deceptive now over
something that doesn't really

1340
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:55,710
necessarily make sense,
you know,

1341
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,220
after losing the Mark Hunt like that.
This doesn't make sense.

1342
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,590
It doesn't make sense.
Um,

1343
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,180
the testosterone thing,
that is a,

1344
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:07,700
another thing that I feel like was
medically very irresponsible the way

1345
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:12,701
they handled it and also that they
didn't allow guys to take something like

1346
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:18,221
an estrogen blocker or something that
Hcg or something that restarts your end

1347
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:19,394
to,
consist of,

1348
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:23,560
but yet they allow these guys to fight
and scheduled flights just a couple of

1349
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:25,990
months after getting off testosterone
therapy.

1350
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,170
So you put these athletes in a very
precarious situation where you're

1351
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:31,900
dangling this gigantic financial carrot
in front of them.

1352
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:32,981
You know,
you're saying,

1353
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:34,090
hey man,
we got to fight.

1354
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,370
You know,
you're going to make x amount of dollars

1355
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:38,620
is going to be awesome for you.
But here's the kicker,

1356
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,230
no more testosterone,
so all this stuff,

1357
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,670
it's been making you feel good and
making your camps go better and allowing

1358
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:47,920
you to recover faster.
That shit's out the door.

1359
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,390
So now you have to deal with not just
your 37 year old endocrine system,

1360
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,870
which is fine,
but a 37 year old and inconsistent and

1361
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,020
that needs to be restarted and you can't
restart it.

1362
00:56:59,290 --> 00:56:59,921
Yeah,
that's right.

1363
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:00,381
And,
and,

1364
00:57:00,381 --> 00:57:02,110
and they do put them in a tough spot
too.

1365
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,050
And I would be curious if this was ever
tested in a court because they put them

1366
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:08,020
in an interesting spot where a guy gets
advice from his doctor,

1367
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,100
which you're supposed to listen to and
he has to cross reference that advice

1368
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,550
with an athletic commission will time
out a second.

1369
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:16,940
We're not talking about illegal drugs
here.

1370
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:21,950
We're talking about legal medicine,
FDA approved medicine that I'm taking

1371
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:25,810
appropriately and in conjunction with my
physician and you're telling me I can't

1372
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:27,970
take it.
And that even happens with the common

1373
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:30,700
cold flu and that they'll be in some of
these silly things.

1374
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,310
And Anderson Silva,
so he popped for that steroid,

1375
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,220
but two of the things he popped for were
over the counter.

1376
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:39,970
One of them is a sleep aid that sits on
the shelf next to Nyquil.

1377
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,990
None of us knew was band until he got
flagged for.

1378
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,990
Well,
scratch our head guy.

1379
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,350
Maybe that's on the banned list.
What is a sleep aid provide like as far

1380
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:48,710
as performance benefit?
That's.

1381
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,680
So everybody likes to go back to that
go.

1382
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:52,590
This doesn't help my performance.
That's,

1383
00:57:52,591 --> 00:57:54,730
it's not a performance test.
It's not a steroids test.

1384
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:58,330
It's not a drugs test.
It's a banned substance test.

1385
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:00,640
And that's where they go way out of
bounds.

1386
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:02,650
Sometimes I think back to the,
the,

1387
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,040
the Chinese gymnast where they stripped
her metal,

1388
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,120
uh,
in 2004 and kicked her out of the

1389
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:10,210
Olympics forever because she had a
billionth of a trace of Ibuprofen which

1390
00:58:10,211 --> 00:58:12,120
has a street name of advil.
I'm going,

1391
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,550
this is silly,
you know,

1392
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,240
this is silly.
Good.

1393
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,610
Well,
it's an antiinflammatory in that would

1394
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:19,330
help performance you go,
that's a good thing to take some legal

1395
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,830
to take a legal thing that you've found
that can help you.

1396
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,830
Why would you take anything that could
hurt you?

1397
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,450
That was another thing that John came
out.

1398
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:28,600
He was so adamant that I took nothing to
help my performance.

1399
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:29,711
I'm going,
John,

1400
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:33,010
I don't know why that's the high canon
of bad things you don't want to be

1401
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:34,690
associated with.
You took coke,

1402
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,980
which is a felony and can kill you,
but now you're standing on the moral

1403
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,290
high ground that you didn't take
anything that could help you.

1404
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,300
That's just weird.
That's weird.

1405
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:45,940
It's a weird way to phrase it.
If you say,

1406
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:50,941
I didn't take anything that would help
my performance than yc saying no.

1407
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,270
Say what the fuck you took and why you
took it.

1408
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,840
Sure.
Say what it is,

1409
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,540
but we only white Joe.
Why would you take any of it's a

1410
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,450
supplement or anything else?
Why would you take it if you didn't have

1411
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:03,850
a reasonable expectation that it helped
your performance because you're not

1412
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:05,440
taking it for that.
Then you're taking for the opposite.

1413
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,274
It has to be one of them.

1414
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,930
What are you taking it for?
Something else in life.

1415
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:11,560
Maybe you've taken it for anxiety maybe,
but that doesn't make any sense with

1416
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,450
what he was taking it.
But you know,

1417
00:59:13,451 --> 00:59:13,930
I mean,
look,

1418
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,530
Anderson was taking a liquid.
Seattle's because he likes to party.

1419
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,780
I mean,
why?

1420
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,040
Why do people take different

1421
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,290
things that are not,
that have nothing to do with athletic

1422
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,330
performance?
They take it because there's a desired

1423
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:27,950
result.
Um,

1424
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,200
but what I'm saying,
if you're trying to fall into the scope

1425
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:33,080
of a medicine,
well I can have an estrogen blocker

1426
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:34,130
would be,
or testosterone.

1427
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:37,100
Those are classified as medicine and
then maybe it can call it drugs all they

1428
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:38,840
want.
That's medicine under the FDA.

1429
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,590
You can't become a medicine unless you
can reasonably prove that it's going to

1430
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:44,840
help a patient.
You can't be a doctor.

1431
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:47,930
Give somebody something that brings them
down and makes them worse.

1432
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:49,010
That's malpractice.
Well,

1433
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:52,580
here's what I'm saying is I know for
while he denied that it would help his

1434
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:53,121
performance,
like,

1435
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:54,620
well,
of course you took it to make you feel,

1436
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:56,360
but whatever.
I'm drinking coffee right now for the

1437
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:58,430
caffeine.
That's just what it is.

1438
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,640
That that helps your performance and you
were one of the first people to tell me

1439
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:05,450
that there's a very specific amount of
caffeine that you're allowed to have,

1440
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:07,160
so you would take an for them.

1441
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,810
You wouldn't trust a cup of coffee,
right?

1442
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:10,370
Well,
yes,

1443
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:11,930
that's true.
That is true,

1444
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:14,920
but I just think that's ridiculous.
One to.

1445
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:17,960
They say that to now.
You'd have to be tested your bodies to

1446
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:20,900
all these different things,
but they say that two cups of coffee in

1447
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:23,870
a 15 minute period will make you test
hot.

1448
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,950
Now you'll only test taught for about 15
minutes because caffeine wears off so

1449
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:29,120
fast,
but yes,

1450
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:31,820
if somebody was to come in right now
I've got three different coffees in

1451
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:34,220
front of me.
I could be above the limit on that.

1452
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,340
I'm sitting here going,
Oh,

1453
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,340
I'm getting jazzed up to do a podcast.
I'm not sure that that.

1454
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,940
I'm not sure that that relates,
but the rules are the rules.

1455
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:43,250
I'd be cheating,
but is that out of competition since it

1456
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:46,220
has such a short life,
like if you came in here is because when

1457
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:49,280
John tested positive for cocaine against
Daniel,

1458
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,740
it was three weeks out,
so it was out of competition.

1459
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,480
So it wasn't like he was fighting coked
up.

1460
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,711
Right?
That's right.

1461
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:57,160
And there is two different sets of
standards there.

1462
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,680
Uh,
and caffeine gotTa,

1463
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,910
if you're out of competition,
you must be fine.

1464
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,760
Advils and you know,
we talked about advil or there is some

1465
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,370
that are only band in competition.
There are a lot out of competition and

1466
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:09,860
then there's some no nos forever,
but that's where it starts to get

1467
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:12,170
confusing.
And then the way they've handled it is

1468
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:13,730
to go,
it's on the athlete.

1469
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,421
He was like,
well,

1470
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,350
okay,
fair enough.

1471
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:17,030
But athletes,
particularly,

1472
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:20,330
fighters are the lowest form of society.
You're the government.

1473
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,720
You can't just put it on the athletes.
It's got to be your,

1474
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,850
the government.
You're operating on the taxpayer's

1475
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:27,110
dollar.
You've got offices,

1476
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:29,780
you're making the rule.
You take some responsibility to.

1477
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:30,801
Yeah,
no,

1478
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:31,850
I agree.
I agree.

1479
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,420
And I think especially when you're
talking about a medical issue like this

1480
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:38,390
testosterone therapy issue,
I mean it's worked itself out.

1481
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,040
That does,
did settle in time.

1482
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:43,430
They allowed it to just play itself out,
but I think a lot of guys got fucked

1483
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:45,320
over and I,
I hate to,

1484
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:47,390
um,
be a Vituro apologist.

1485
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,300
Uh,
but because I've been such a,

1486
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,460
I was such a fan of trt.
Veto loved him.

1487
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,910
Oh my God.
And we all did.

1488
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,670
It was such a free is great.
When he,

1489
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,620
when he fought bisping and rockhold
he's,

1490
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:01,460
we'll kick in people and don't be t RTV
tour was fucking terrifying.

1491
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,760
But vituro when he fought Weidman,
I remember feeling when he went into the

1492
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:10,010
octagon and I saw him bouncing around
and it's loose,

1493
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:11,990
skin was moving all over.
His body is like,

1494
01:02:11,991 --> 01:02:13,280
wow,
this guy's fucked.

1495
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,780
Yeah,
like his body is fucked.

1496
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,950
This is not a regular 37 year old guy
who was in shape who hasn't taken

1497
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,180
anything.
No,

1498
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:25,250
this is a fucking world championship
caliber pro athlete whose bodies been

1499
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,110
just compromised,
massively compromised.

1500
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:28,291
So,
I mean,

1501
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,540
he's rebounded.
He looked much better now,

1502
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,010
but God damn you look terrible

1503
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,080
and acg is so important for any doctor
will tell you.

1504
01:02:35,081 --> 01:02:36,530
If you go on testosterone,
you've got it.

1505
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:38,420
Then go on Hcg.
You got to turn that,

1506
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,060
turn that back on.
He didn't have that benefit.

1507
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,150
The rules came in.
He had two different flags and he just

1508
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:47,300
wasn't ready to go down that path,
so he literally stopped everything cold

1509
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:49,510
Turkey opposite of the advice of his
doctrine.

1510
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,950
I've never asked him about the.
I just know his doctor would have said,

1511
01:02:51,951 --> 01:02:52,820
look,
this is what you need,

1512
01:02:52,821 --> 01:02:53,840
and he goes,
I'm out.

1513
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,420
There's no room for error here.
They've changed the rules.

1514
01:02:56,421 --> 01:02:57,254
I'm out

1515
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,410
as crazy as they.
That could affect them longterm,

1516
01:02:59,411 --> 01:02:59,790
Joe.
It,

1517
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,480
it certainly can,
and certainly the beating that he took

1518
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:04,300
could affect them longterm and the
beating.

1519
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,650
There's a big factor of having
incredibly low testosterone and we have

1520
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:11,370
very low testosterone.
When he went into that fight there,

1521
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,500
there would be a possibility.
I actually see that's not true.

1522
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:19,000
I should.
I should recant that because Weidman got

1523
01:03:19,001 --> 01:03:24,001
in his face at the way in and was saying
you took because he tested at 1200 and

1524
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:27,790
Weidman tested it three and he was like,
what the fuck is going on?

1525
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:32,050
How do you have four times as much
testosterone is me and I talked to

1526
01:03:32,051 --> 01:03:33,100
Novitsky about.
I was trying.

1527
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,740
I was like,
please explain to a moron like me,

1528
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,930
what the fuck is going on?
And they were saying,

1529
01:03:37,931 --> 01:03:38,480
well,
it's,

1530
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,900
it's dependent,
it's time dependent.

1531
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,290
It's how much available testosterone to
it.

1532
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,750
Like when did they test him?
Was He recovering from sleep?

1533
01:03:46,751 --> 01:03:48,300
Was he at its peak?
There was.

1534
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:53,510
Did he had he done explosive athletics
like squats or deadlifts very recently,

1535
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:56,740
and then recovered his testosterone ramp
back up.

1536
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:01,300
Did they catch Weidman after Weidman had
a grueling workout and his testosterone

1537
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:02,410
was down?
Right.

1538
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,240
There's a lot of factors apparently
that,

1539
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:07,150
that play into that and Weidman and he
even said himself,

1540
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:07,631
he said,
look,

1541
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:09,850
I,
I kind of have low testosterone while

1542
01:04:09,851 --> 01:04:11,380
this.
While TRT was illegal.

1543
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,000
He's like,
I could qualify for it.

1544
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,260
I can go in and qualify for it.

1545
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,690
Yeah,
I remember that very well,

1546
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,690
but dev toward did not have any,
uh,

1547
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:23,200
he did not have testosterone.
He did his level was high and all of

1548
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:25,240
that,
but he didn't have any endogenous

1549
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:27,700
testosterone in him.
He had no supplement whatsoever,

1550
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:32,050
so that was a little bit misunderstood.
And then also thank you very much.

1551
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:34,790
And then also to his po or to your point
Weidman,

1552
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,940
when he was tested,
if he would have been tested in the

1553
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:39,360
morning,
it would have been down a if he would've

1554
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,920
just had a hard workout and chewed up a
lot of the test,

1555
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:43,980
it would have been done.
So that was a little confusing.

1556
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:48,220
[inaudible] hands were clean there and
Chris was misunderstanding what he was

1557
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:52,480
reading and let loose on him.
And Chris had every right to assume that

1558
01:04:52,481 --> 01:04:54,370
[inaudible] was still trying to slip
that through.

1559
01:04:54,371 --> 01:04:57,130
That was the better part of his career.
But in fairness,

1560
01:04:57,131 --> 01:04:58,480
he wasn't.
When Vitorin goes,

1561
01:04:58,481 --> 01:04:59,231
hey,
I'm out.

1562
01:04:59,231 --> 01:05:00,064
He really,
he,

1563
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,410
he was out and they tested the hell out
of Itar.

1564
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,510
He's passed them off.
Victoria went straight.

1565
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:05,560
Yeah,
he had to.

1566
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,870
And his body really showed it.
Yeah.

1567
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,060
Well,
when did he fought Henderson,

1568
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,021
the,
uh,

1569
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:14,110
the third Henderson fight in Brazil.
Uh,

1570
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:16,240
he looked like he was gaining is muscle
mass back.

1571
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:17,620
You looked it looked a little bit
better,

1572
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:20,650
but he's just,
he just does not look like trt Vittorio.

1573
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,780
Physically.
He's the guy that's had the,

1574
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,510
the,
the biggest difference.

1575
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,740
And I just,
I feel like if you're going to just say

1576
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,110
you have to be off of it,
I think is ridiculous.

1577
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:34,330
I think,
I mean he wanted that title shot and is

1578
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:38,140
really important to him,
but I feel like that medically they had

1579
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:40,900
a responsibility to give the guy a
break,

1580
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,830
like to say we're going to give you six
months of,

1581
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:49,890
of restorative therapy and they'll allow
your body to come back into a normal

1582
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:54,130
testosterone range and then reenter into
the drug testing,

1583
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,370
you know,
and we'll test you during that time to

1584
01:05:57,371 --> 01:06:00,670
make sure that you're not taking
anything else on top of that.

1585
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,300
But to not allow the guy any sort of
medicine that can restart his endocrine

1586
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:11,401
system seems very irresponsible when
it's such a primary factor in

1587
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:15,010
performance in.
You're not talking about like fucking

1588
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:17,260
volleyball,
you're talking about head kicks,

1589
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,720
you know,
and the difference between getting beat

1590
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:22,450
up and not getting beat up there between
getting brain damage and not getting

1591
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:25,240
brain damage could.
That could play a huge factor in there.

1592
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,770
Right?

1593
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,180
Yeah.
And I think in hindsight,

1594
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,130
I think the commission would have
handled it different.

1595
01:06:29,131 --> 01:06:30,330
They've kind of even said that,
hey,

1596
01:06:30,331 --> 01:06:34,200
we pulled the rug out here and they went
as close to taking some,

1597
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:36,360
some of the responsibilities you could
without taking it.

1598
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,440
And the other side was fighters.
We should've been able to myself,

1599
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,010
we should have been,
was just go time,

1600
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,500
time out.
I can't comply,

1601
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,660
but I want to be in compliance,
but I can't right now.

1602
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,240
I've taken my oars out of the water.
I'm going to go do my.

1603
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,710
Leave me out of it.
Don't test me.

1604
01:06:49,711 --> 01:06:50,800
I'll tell you right now.
It's not.

1605
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,860
Give me six months.
To your point,

1606
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:55,530
you'd almost have to retire,
but none of us knew.

1607
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,510
None of us.
None of us knew what we didn't know.

1608
01:06:57,511 --> 01:06:58,860
Like with Vandelay,
when the guy showed up,

1609
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:01,440
when the guy came to me and I'm in the
closet with none of us knew what was

1610
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:01,920
going on.

1611
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,280
It's kind of a different world now.
You have to have that education process.

1612
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:06,720
Whatever John's going through with Tim
means,

1613
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,880
what frame this is,
how we learn,

1614
01:07:08,881 --> 01:07:10,650
you know,
we learned from guys stumbling and

1615
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:13,710
stubbing their toe.
They just don't give a big allowance for

1616
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:15,210
that.
It's pretty black and white on these

1617
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:16,800
rules.
John's going to be out for two years.

1618
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:20,370
I keep hearing things speculative on how
long it's going to be real clear as it's

1619
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:22,350
going to be off for two years.
That's the minimum.

1620
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,590
If he testified he's out for two years.
That's just what it is.

1621
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,120
Well,
Anderson wasn't now for two years.

1622
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,140
What was the person?
Uh,

1623
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:34,250
Anderson beat the clock on the mandatory
how long you're out.

1624
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:37,590
He came in just before that.
Hector lumbar came in just before that.

1625
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:40,890
So those guys weren't subject to that.
Anderson got,

1626
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,510
they could have done whatever they want
for it.

1627
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,120
To him,
the standard was nine to 12 months.

1628
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:47,610
He probably would have got nine,
but he denied it to the event,

1629
01:07:47,611 --> 01:07:50,280
the hate that he shows up.
All of a sudden he doesn't speak

1630
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:53,010
English.
They hate that they were still pretty

1631
01:07:53,011 --> 01:07:57,930
light on him though for three substances
and a guy that still a was resisting the

1632
01:07:57,931 --> 01:08:01,950
test and coming in with the store and
refusing to talk to him 12 months that

1633
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,170
they were pretty reasonable by their
standards,

1634
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,960
by their standard.
What do you think is a reasonable

1635
01:08:06,961 --> 01:08:10,440
suspension?
If a guy does get popped for estrogen

1636
01:08:10,441 --> 01:08:11,550
blockers and he says,
Hey,

1637
01:08:11,551 --> 01:08:12,930
I fucked up.
I want an edge.

1638
01:08:12,931 --> 01:08:15,080
I took it.
What's a reasonable amount of

1639
01:08:15,081 --> 01:08:16,030
suspension?
What?

1640
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,280
My answer will be different because you
said for estrogen blockers,

1641
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:21,100
again,
he's blocking something.

1642
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:23,300
He's not adding something.
He's blocking something.

1643
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:26,450
Now they come back in with their
intellectual approach to go where you're

1644
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:27,920
only blocking it because you did
something before.

1645
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:29,570
We didn't catch it before,
so we're going to get you now.

1646
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,050
Not a terrible argument,
but if you just look at what he did,

1647
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:34,580
I think that.
I think there needs to be some

1648
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:37,040
conversation there.
I was there in front of the Commission

1649
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,550
One day I got approved for a steroid for
testosterone.

1650
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:46,390
That same day,
Nick Diaz took $100,000 fine and lost

1651
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:51,431
his license for a year for pot of which
he had illegal medication for Blah Blah.

1652
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:55,310
You know the story on that,
so you never know what's going to happen

1653
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:57,530
when you get in there.
You never know what's going to happen.

1654
01:08:57,531 --> 01:08:59,570
It's not a courtroom.
Media likes to say he's gonna have his

1655
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:00,500
day in court.
Well that's the.

1656
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:04,520
You don't have a day in court.
Court implies a judge which implies a

1657
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:06,980
disinterested third party.
You're going in front of the people who

1658
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:09,680
have accused you,
so if they clear you there,

1659
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:11,270
now admitting they got it wrong to start
with,

1660
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:15,410
that's literally never happened.
They have never been wrong where they

1661
01:09:15,411 --> 01:09:15,791
go,
hey,

1662
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:17,030
we have this wrong.
Go on about your day.

1663
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:17,690
It's never happened.

1664
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:21,200
Is vandelay the first guy to sue the
athletic commission and when.

1665
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,980
Okay,
was he the for?

1666
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:24,960
I can't think of anyone else,
but I'd have to look.

1667
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:27,180
You know,
Nick Diaz did the same thing and they

1668
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:27,811
finally said,
okay,

1669
01:09:27,811 --> 01:09:28,540
he'll look,
let's settle,

1670
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,070
but I think with Nick Diaz,
they made a compromise and they,

1671
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:33,360
they,
they abandoned for five years for pot

1672
01:09:33,361 --> 01:09:36,000
and the world went crazy and I gave out
the fucking Nevada state athletic

1673
01:09:36,001 --> 01:09:37,080
commission,
his phone number.

1674
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,520
I was like,
call him up,

1675
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,990
tell him it's sucks.
Sure.

1676
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,360
And the whole world went crazy.
Internet was,

1677
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:46,410
they were making petitions and everybody
was emailing and writing people.

1678
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:50,000
People were like justifiably outraged,
but that,

1679
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:53,220
that was a little bit different.
They reduced his sentence and the

1680
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,730
vandelay thing was interesting because
it seemed like a judge outside of the

1681
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:58,590
commission made the call.

1682
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,020
That is who did it and it was really
weird because they came in with two

1683
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:02,771
things.
First off,

1684
01:10:02,771 --> 01:10:04,480
can you banned him for life?
And second,

1685
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,750
did you have jurisdiction over?
Now if you read the statute,

1686
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:10,900
you don't have to be a lawyer.
The statute is very small and it's

1687
01:10:10,901 --> 01:10:14,740
extremely clear.
They did not have jurisdiction over him.

1688
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:17,990
At the same time,
they can do anything they want so they

1689
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:20,470
could banned him for life.
You get in front of the judge,

1690
01:10:20,471 --> 01:10:21,910
the judge rule,
just the opposite.

1691
01:10:21,911 --> 01:10:23,890
You can't ban him for life.
That's too extreme,

1692
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:28,180
which is not true for the statute.
They can do that that historically they

1693
01:10:28,181 --> 01:10:29,050
have,
but they can.

1694
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:34,390
They did not have the right to test him
though because he was not licensed yet

1695
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:38,200
in Nevada and the statute clearly says
to the licensee of which he was not

1696
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,420
kaiser who was in at the time said,
listen,

1697
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,020
the fights been announced in my state.
He's in my state.

1698
01:10:44,021 --> 01:10:45,160
That gives me the right.
Well,

1699
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:49,000
the judge agreed with him that judge got
it just backwards,

1700
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:51,220
but when they did it,
when they didn't realize,

1701
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,300
when the judge did not rule on how long
the suspension would be,

1702
01:10:55,301 --> 01:10:58,420
he sent him back to Nevada.
He still hasn't got that result.

1703
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,580
So for everyday they kicked the can down
the road.

1704
01:11:00,581 --> 01:11:03,730
They when he's still suspended,
so he got his release from the UFC.

1705
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,740
He can go fight in another state he
wants right now.

1706
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,310
Well,
he's preparing to fight fader,

1707
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:08,900
right?
Isn't that a fight that they were trying

1708
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:09,960
to make for reason?

1709
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,870
Not that I know of.
I heard,

1710
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,130
I heard a rumor that he would get to
that eventually,

1711
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,460
but vandelays got some kind of wrestling
thing lined up for like a tag team.

1712
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:20,280
Wrestling matches how it's going to ease
his way back in the pool.

1713
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,720
He just killed it.
Got Hit by a car.

1714
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,970
I read this.
These.

1715
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,940
Okay.
Fortunately,

1716
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:25,290
yeah.
Well I thought I thought he had shoulder

1717
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,700
surgery.
He could have.

1718
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,470
Could have.
I heard it hasn't the latest

1719
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,820
competition.
Okay.

1720
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,640
Yeah.
Well I had heard that he was going to be

1721
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:34,020
fighting.
See if you can find that.

1722
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:36,920
I heard that he was going to be fighting
fate or in,

1723
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:41,340
in Japan and you know,
the doorman seeing his fight with

1724
01:11:41,341 --> 01:11:42,870
Maldonado was like,
wow,

1725
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,340
how far the mighty have fallen.
He does not look the same at all.

1726
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,200
Fatigue's a son of a gun too,
man.

1727
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:51,690
When you get tired it doesn't.
It doesn't matter how good you are.

1728
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:53,160
It doesn't matter what you did before.

1729
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,690
If you get tired,
you got problems.

1730
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:57,060
Now the good news for him is Maldonado
got tired too.

1731
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:00,690
Yeah.
Momo has never been a guy that's been

1732
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:04,380
the most conditioned guy in the world,
but he is a guy with fantastic boxing,

1733
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,930
very good boxing,
and he caught fade or with a couple of

1734
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:08,610
good shots and had them really badly
hurt.

1735
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:09,930
Yeah.
A lot of people think that fight could

1736
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:12,390
have been stopped.
I mean under a bad judge.

1737
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,650
I don't think it should have been
stopped,

1738
01:12:13,651 --> 01:12:15,990
but under a bad referee it could have
been or referee.

1739
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:18,850
That was a little too quick to pull the
trigger or if it wasn't in Russia for

1740
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:19,151
one.
Yeah,

1741
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:21,270
there were.
There was definitely some politics there

1742
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:25,350
and I felt bad for Maldonado Maldonado
thought he was going to get a fair shake

1743
01:12:25,351 --> 01:12:26,161
and I'm looking at it going,
well,

1744
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:26,390
no,
I'm.

1745
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:28,830
Although it makes sure you get a good
paycheck because you're not getting a

1746
01:12:28,831 --> 01:12:32,100
fair shake in Russia.
And then he even filed a complaint after

1747
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:34,860
the fact that petition and he felt too.
It's like Malden,

1748
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:37,080
well maybe you don't know how this works
over there,

1749
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:39,060
but that it's over.
It's over.

1750
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,550
I mean unless he flat lined them,
he wasn't winning.

1751
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:46,920
Who would've had to have knocked him out
and I'm sure whatever referee at the

1752
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:50,010
time would be very hesitant to stop that
fight with.

1753
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,750
Even with theater,
getting his brains beat.

1754
01:12:51,751 --> 01:12:52,980
Sure.
If he thought he could make it to the

1755
01:12:52,981 --> 01:12:55,860
bell and the real controversy,
it was that first round that you're

1756
01:12:55,861 --> 01:12:57,150
talking about with the ref could have
stopped.

1757
01:12:57,151 --> 01:12:59,220
It probably should have.
It wasn't a 10,

1758
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:00,300
eight round and it's like,
look,

1759
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:03,540
if that's not a 10,
eight round that what is in that fight?

1760
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,980
Should have been a dry.
It was.

1761
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,210
It was one round,
but it was 10,

1762
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:06,511
eight,
two,

1763
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:09,030
two rounds for fader.
A lot of people argue rounds two and

1764
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:09,540
three,
but they're.

1765
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,950
They're wrong.
Fader one those rounds.

1766
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:12,150
Maybe they are,
but he want them.

1767
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:13,850
They should have been a drop.
Yeah,

1768
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,590
he.
Him Not being in the UFC during his

1769
01:13:16,591 --> 01:13:19,170
prime is one of the great tragedies of
MMA.

1770
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,660
I really,
really feel that I would have loved to

1771
01:13:21,661 --> 01:13:25,560
seen the fate or that fought cro,
cop fight in the UFC and I think he

1772
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:27,150
would have been heavyweight champion.
I really do.

1773
01:13:27,151 --> 01:13:30,150
I think he.
The only argument against him being the

1774
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:31,680
greatest of all time,
in my opinion,

1775
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:35,550
is Cain Velasquez and I guess you could
kind of make it for overdue,

1776
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:40,020
but I think for doing that got knocked
out by Steve Bay was a healthy Verdugo.

1777
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:43,520
He just got emotional and crazy and he
charged after Steve Bay and steep based

1778
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:44,400
that fucking good.

1779
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,240
Yeah,
he is.

1780
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,100
He's really good.
I mean Steve Bay is a bad motherfucker.

1781
01:13:48,101 --> 01:13:50,820
It was no doubt about it.
He's a deserving world champion,

1782
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,810
but man,
I'm just.

1783
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:56,190
I would've loved to seen primetime cane
versus primetime fatal.

1784
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:58,410
Sure.
I'd love to say to you and I maintained

1785
01:13:58,411 --> 01:14:02,180
that Cain is the most intimidating
figure in the heavyweight division that

1786
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,680
even though he's jerking the curtain on
Saturday night for the,

1787
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:08,130
for the biggest card ever,
he is the most intimidating guy in the

1788
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:10,410
back.
He's a jerk in the curtain jerk and the

1789
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:13,120
curtain is the guy that starts the show.
You've got to pull the curtain out of

1790
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:16,930
the way to start the show that every
started as he started on Saturday night.

1791
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:17,720
Right.
You got the heavy,

1792
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,730
the former heavyweight champion who's
headlining cards and had bills with his

1793
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,980
name on the top of.
Now a sudden he's jerking the curtain

1794
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,690
because it's UFC 200.

1795
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,490
That's what I'm saying.
It was the biggest car there was,

1796
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:28,660
you know,
performance.

1797
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:31,450
He had great performance.
Travis Browne is nobody's fool.

1798
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,980
No.
Travis Browne is ranked number four in

1799
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:34,810
the world,
was ranked number three and he should be

1800
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,360
one of the.
Travis caught him clean straight right

1801
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:39,940
hand at first round.
One of the few guys to beat Josh Barnett

1802
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:42,540
and Travis is a good heavy weight.
You need to be a basketball player.

1803
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,520
You talked about steep a minute ago.
Steve plays a good athlete and we don't

1804
01:14:45,521 --> 01:14:46,660
have a ton of them.
You know,

1805
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:48,430
some of the great athletes that are that
size.

1806
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,400
They go into some other professions.
You don't usually get them in this one.

1807
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,310
Steve Bay's a good looking heavyweight.
He moves well.

1808
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:56,140
He works hard.
He's got the wrestling background,

1809
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:58,600
played baseball.
He's just a good guy,

1810
01:14:58,601 --> 01:14:59,140
man.
Yeah.

1811
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,300
He really.
What?

1812
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:05,440
What came brings to the table is some
freak cardio and perfect technique.

1813
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,263
I mean,
he's just,

1814
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:12,260
he's so unusual in his cardio.
We'll kick incredible,

1815
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,720
crazy through two of them receive a try
in that.

1816
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:16,270
So we're good on that.
Javier,

1817
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:17,081
pull them aside.
He goes,

1818
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:18,490
Hey,
can we can start working on Wilcox?

1819
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,920
I don't know what it was saying,
but they were good.

1820
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,960
There was beautiful.
There was nothing wrong with them.

1821
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:25,190
I mean,
some guy when Weidman through that we'll

1822
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,500
kick against rockhold you like blah
blah,

1823
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:26,741
blah,
blah.

1824
01:15:26,741 --> 01:15:29,230
What the fuck are you doing?
And then he gets taken down.

1825
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,730
Chris.
Why?

1826
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:32,170
And it wasn't a good.
We'll kick.

1827
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:33,580
It was goofy.
We'll kick.

1828
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,260
Yeah.
It just didn't look right,

1829
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:36,480
but when you saw throw,
throw,

1830
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,660
you're like,
oh that's perfect.

1831
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,010
Yeah.
But that's,

1832
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:40,900
that's how he executes.
Punches,

1833
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,020
kicks,
takedowns.

1834
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,260
Everything is perfect.
There's no wind up.

1835
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,690
Nothing.
Nothing has like extra horsepower behind

1836
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:48,280
it.
Everything's precise.

1837
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:51,010
He's one of my favorite all time guys to
watch because of that.

1838
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:51,940
Yeah,
I agree with that.

1839
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:54,670
And that's your porn on for June.
So for doing beats fader who might be

1840
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:55,020
the.
Great.

1841
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,740
So you say you don't know who the
greatest ever was.

1842
01:15:56,741 --> 01:16:00,010
It was it,
was it a fader or was it cane?

1843
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,040
Verdugo.
Unbeatable for doom.

1844
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,490
Doesn't end up in the conversation.
It's one of those does things.

1845
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,240
He does.
I think he does,

1846
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,730
but you know,
I mean because you got to think the

1847
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:14,230
Prime Verducci who beat feet or the
prime for doom that beat cain could

1848
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:16,030
probably have beaten those guys no
matter where.

1849
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:18,190
It's very possible he could have beaten
those guys no matter what.

1850
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:19,930
So I think he does go into the
conversation.

1851
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:24,230
It's just the history,
that cane hat and the history that fade

1852
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:28,060
or had mean canes,
insane wars and the way broke down

1853
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:30,250
junior dos Santos,
it gets knocked out in the first fight

1854
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:34,120
and then the next two fights just puts
off fucking helacious beating on him.

1855
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:36,950
Right.
I think points,

1856
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:38,110
you know,
the MMA,

1857
01:16:38,111 --> 01:16:39,310
math sucks.
Sure.

1858
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:40,690
We,
you just,

1859
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:42,640
it's real hard to say this guy,
be that guy.

1860
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:44,530
So He's number one and that guy beat
this guy.

1861
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:46,270
So.
And when you talk about it,

1862
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:49,390
what are the elements that comes in is
that the guys wins and losses and his

1863
01:16:49,391 --> 01:16:51,620
skills.
It's also an intimidation factor right?

1864
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,830
What kind of intimidation they have,
what we're doing know,

1865
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,530
mix the joker face,
and he's always teasing around so he

1866
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:58,270
gets overlooked,
but I don't think that's fair.

1867
01:16:58,271 --> 01:16:59,560
You know,
the same thing's happening to bisping.

1868
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,900
Weidman comes out,
he says,

1869
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:05,380
bisping's the most undeserving person of
all time to end up at a title spot,

1870
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,920
and I'm going to time timeout and
Christmas a start.

1871
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:10,310
But Chris Timeout.
You become famous

1872
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,040
and world champion by beating Anderson
Silva.

1873
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,980
Bisping just beat the same guy that you
beat.

1874
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,130
Bisbing just beat the same guy that puts
yourself over.

1875
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:20,890
Why does it not put bisbing over?
Now?

1876
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:24,540
He just beats rockhold who beat you.
And but bisping still not over.

1877
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:25,880
Now.
It's kind of a weird thing.

1878
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:30,290
Not only does it put bisping over,
but bisping beat rockhold.

1879
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:33,380
When rockhold was fighting,
he wasn't clowning around.

1880
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,770
When when Chris beat Anderson,
he beat him twice.

1881
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:38,570
He beat him once.
When Anderson dropped,

1882
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,990
his hands was being silly and he got
cracked and everybody was like,

1883
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,330
I can't believe Anderson did that.
It was,

1884
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:47,570
it was a terrible way to lose.
It wasn't just that they were going to

1885
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:50,000
exchange and Chris landed a bomb of a
left hook.

1886
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,400
No,
it was anderson was pretending to be

1887
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:56,270
hurt and then he was like faking
wobbling and trying to duck out of the

1888
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,580
way of punches like he always does and
Chris cracked him.

1889
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,640
Then the second fight,
he breaks his leg and he throws,

1890
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,580
throws a Kyc,
checks it and breaks late.

1891
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:09,140
Granted Chris beat the shit out of them
the first round and almost like head.

1892
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:12,770
I'm in bad trouble in that first round.
Controlled them on the ground,

1893
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,720
beat him up.
So they go into the second round.

1894
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:17,930
He breaks his leg and the second part.
So those are more freakish.

1895
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,580
Sure.
Then what bisping debt,

1896
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,480
what bisbing did is just straight up,
he fucking landed a beautiful left hook,

1897
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,150
heard them moved in for the kill,
closed the show,

1898
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:28,160
legit champion.
One hundred percent.

1899
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:28,880
No controversy.

1900
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,600
I've tried fully agree with that and I
love this next match up.

1901
01:18:31,601 --> 01:18:33,050
You know,
you heard it's going to be Dan Henderson

1902
01:18:33,051 --> 01:18:35,510
and that doesn't go in the rankings.
I get all of that,

1903
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:37,610
but you know,
I liked the UFC when they make the

1904
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:40,070
matches that people want to see and
that's an interesting match.

1905
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,590
If you think,
if you think this is going to just go in

1906
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:44,150
and beat him or you look at dance
record,

1907
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:46,100
you think that bisping doesn't go to bed
at night.

1908
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,200
Remember on what that was like?
The teasing,

1909
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:50,830
the highlight reel,
all the people to everybody telling them

1910
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:51,321
about,
you know,

1911
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:56,321
making fun of him flying through the air
when he pounded bisbing just to hit.

1912
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,400
It was more conscious.
Yeah,

1913
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,720
that's his logo.
Yeah.

1914
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,520
I mean this is highlight reel,
knockout.

1915
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:03,290
I stayed at Dan Henderson's house for a
month,

1916
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:06,560
helping them train for [inaudible] and
when you turn dance tv off at night,

1917
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:10,450
the remote control says lights out and
it's him hitting bisping lights up.

1918
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:12,830
That's what lights up on his remote
control.

1919
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:17,240
So I mean he doesn't have confidence
going into the shittiest competence.

1920
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:18,470
He knows he could beat him.
He already did.

1921
01:19:18,471 --> 01:19:19,760
If you think bespeaks not going,
man,

1922
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:21,440
I really don't want to be in there with
that guy again.

1923
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:23,100
He's going to say,
I want that one back and one,

1924
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,980
he's going to say all those things and
try to convince himself,

1925
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:28,220
but the bottom line is that's relevant.
Dan Henderson will be the world

1926
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:30,050
champion.
It's very possible,

1927
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,470
very possible.
Look.

1928
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:35,530
He just knocked Hector Lombard dead.
Hector's tougher and health tech.

1929
01:19:35,531 --> 01:19:38,360
There's never been given the credit that
he deserved a monster.

1930
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,370
Monster fights it two different ways.
Yeah,

1931
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,120
Nicholas Power and he had Dan hirt and
Dan had hit her.

1932
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,840
He,
Dan hurt him first.

1933
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:47,400
Hector came back,
hurt Dan.

1934
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:52,700
Dan recovered and knocked him out with a
crazy fucking elbow and then another

1935
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:56,130
shot when once he moves basically out
from that back elbow,

1936
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:01,380
but it shows that Dan can still shut the
lights out on a guy in his prime who's a

1937
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:03,480
destroyer,
who's never been knocked out before in

1938
01:20:03,481 --> 01:20:04,080
the aunt.

1939
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,550
I fully agree.
Disagree.

1940
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,220
There's one of those guys of what
happens

1941
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,750
to them and hector stubbed his toe a few
times.

1942
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:12,510
You want to see hector fight.
Hector's got the whole thing.

1943
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,790
He's going to do the promos before and
he's going to mean it.

1944
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,620
He's going to hate that opponent.
It's real,

1945
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:19,140
he's going to look like a million bucks
and he's going to come out fight and

1946
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,290
whatever happens after that happens,
but he's coming to fight when he went

1947
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:23,750
out on his shield.
Um,

1948
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:27,120
and when you look at this fight between
bisping and Henderson,

1949
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:29,010
that's the most exciting fight.
I mean,

1950
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:30,810
that's why I liked the fact that the UFC
made it.

1951
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,210
That's the fight that I wanted to see.
I put it on my instagram.

1952
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:33,750
I'm like,
come,

1953
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,560
yes,
please,

1954
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,880
please,
let's make it happen.

1955
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:36,691
Let's do it.
Yeah.

1956
01:20:36,691 --> 01:20:38,400
That's the fight.
And if Dan goes out,

1957
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,670
Dan came to my,
uh,

1958
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,220
I,
his fight was on a Saturday.

1959
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,580
He came to my show at the Ice House in
Pasadena on Wednesday.

1960
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,520
He said he had been drunk since
Saturday.

1961
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:53,070
That sounds great.
He was so happy.

1962
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:53,701
And I'm like,
well,

1963
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:55,050
what do you think?
Is it possible?

1964
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:56,190
And like,
we're trying,

1965
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:58,550
we're trying to make that happen.
Like the bisping fight.

1966
01:20:58,551 --> 01:21:00,180
I'm like,
that is the fight to make.

1967
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:02,040
And I go,
would you retire if,

1968
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,600
if that would,
if you went out with that,

1969
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:04,453
fine.
He goes,

1970
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:06,060
yeah,
he goes as the only fight I want right

1971
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:06,571
now.
It goes,

1972
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:08,340
I don't even really want to fight
anybody else.

1973
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:10,680
I want to fight him,
and then I think I'm done now.

1974
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:13,980
What about what George St Pierre was
saying he would come back and he wanted

1975
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:15,930
bisping and if George comes to the table
and says,

1976
01:21:15,931 --> 01:21:17,280
I'll come back,
but only if.

1977
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,680
Well then it's only if you're doing it,
you're doing that.

1978
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,890
That's a big fight.
If he comes back and fights bisping.

1979
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:25,200
I don't know if it's a bigger fight than
Henderson.

1980
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,230
I agree that it doesn't sell more,
but I'm saying if that's what you gotta

1981
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:30,340
do to get George back to the table,
I think.

1982
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:32,040
I think you do it.
Don't if you're Dana,

1983
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:32,810
don't you do.
Okay.

1984
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:34,500
You don't think that's what you need to
do.

1985
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,860
I think he's just saying that because
it's an attractive option because you

1986
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:40,380
know bisping has the title.
It's an interesting fight.

1987
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:41,910
He wouldn't have to cut weight.
Mean literally.

1988
01:21:41,911 --> 01:21:44,760
He's walking around at one 86.
This is a much larger.

1989
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:48,750
Got Larger.
You think that Dana told George?

1990
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:49,680
No,
no,

1991
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:50,880
I don't want to do that match.
No,

1992
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:54,450
I just think they probably didn't.
Didn't really have it worked out.

1993
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,610
They were probably discussing it and
trying to figure out what the details

1994
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,220
would be,
but if you look at the most attractive

1995
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:01,710
fight to Bisping,
I would think the Henderson fight would

1996
01:22:01,711 --> 01:22:03,930
be because Dan doesn't have much time
left.

1997
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:06,510
If he misses them this time around,
he might not ever be able to fight them

1998
01:22:06,511 --> 01:22:09,120
again.
This being legitimately wants to get

1999
01:22:09,121 --> 01:22:12,780
revenge and he's the world champion now.
It's his call,

2000
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:15,900
so Kudos to him for taking this fight
for saying,

2001
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:17,540
you know what man,
this guy just blew.

2002
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:20,190
It's not like.
It's not like he called them out right

2003
01:22:20,191 --> 01:22:21,570
after.
He just got knocked out in the first

2004
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:25,620
round by [inaudible] know you called
them out after you just destroyed Hector

2005
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:29,850
Lombard and like that was one of the
greatest knockouts in the history of the

2006
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:31,440
sport.
I mean when that happened,

2007
01:22:31,441 --> 01:22:35,910
because when you consider all that was
at stake when you consider that Dan was

2008
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:37,920
45 years old,
that people thought he was in the

2009
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:41,010
twilight of his career.
That he's stepping in there to fight

2010
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:43,860
hector.
Lumbar was just a fucking monster in his

2011
01:22:43,861 --> 01:22:46,440
prime.
Like that was a great knockout.

2012
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:50,160
An all time great result.
So Kudos to bisping.

2013
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,450
Kudos to bisping for wanting that fight
now and the way bisping needs to handle

2014
01:22:54,451 --> 01:22:57,720
it.
When you factor Shaka Ryan,

2015
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:58,321
who's going,
hey,

2016
01:22:58,321 --> 01:22:59,670
wait a minute,
I have beaten you.

2017
01:22:59,671 --> 01:23:01,830
I got the skills to beat you on the
number one contender.

2018
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,990
Here's how bisping we'll handle it.
No,

2019
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:05,010
you're not.
Wait your.

2020
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,093
That's how they'll handle

2021
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,960
the way to shut those guys down.
Joe.

2022
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,820
It's to go back to the truth,
the truth,

2023
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:10,560
your friend.
Listen,

2024
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,430
Jacques Rey,
you're more dangerous.

2025
01:23:12,431 --> 01:23:15,550
You're more likely to beat me and I'm
not looking to get beat,

2026
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:18,820
so I'm going to go deal with this guy.
It shuts everything.

2027
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:20,540
A bisbing won't do it.
Everybody likes to go,

2028
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:22,860
well wait your turn and this and then
you're not as good as you think you are.

2029
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,640
Go fight your over America.
Whatever it is,

2030
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,290
steer right into it.
Yeah man,

2031
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,090
you're way more like,
here's what I want to do.

2032
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,840
I want to fight the easiest guy in the
biggest stadium for the largest paycheck

2033
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:33,370
and that's what I'm going to politic to
do.

2034
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:34,840
So you do your thing and I'm going to do
mine.

2035
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,033
Well,
the Socceroos,

2036
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:36,710
is that right?
Okay.

2037
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:40,090
Not very good for JOC ray,
because he lost the fight with your

2038
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,440
Ramiro.
I for some reason.

2039
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:42,940
Erroneous.
Yeah.

2040
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:46,060
I had an erroneous memory of jock or a
winning the decision.

2041
01:23:46,061 --> 01:23:48,700
I don't know why.
Maybe it's because of him testing

2042
01:23:48,701 --> 01:23:50,680
positive,
but it was a very close fight too.

2043
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,540
I remember not knowing after it was
over.

2044
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:56,410
I mean I remember you well blasted them
and had them really badly hurt,

2045
01:23:56,411 --> 01:24:00,070
but I felt like Zachary came back a bit
and it was a very close fight towards

2046
01:24:00,071 --> 01:24:01,130
the end,
but it's very tough.

2047
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:03,850
I agree with the decision popped,
but I can see it.

2048
01:24:03,851 --> 01:24:04,960
It was tight.
Jacques raised.

2049
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:07,780
He's fantastic.
They're both fantastic.

2050
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:08,770
Yeah,
they really are.

2051
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:12,430
And when he.
When he lost that fight though,

2052
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:16,810
it's real hard to lose a fight.
Even if a guy that popped for a tainted

2053
01:24:16,811 --> 01:24:20,410
supplement that mean they only give them
a six month suspension,

2054
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,380
it's real hard to make an argument that
you deserve the next shot at the title.

2055
01:24:23,381 --> 01:24:25,480
I think that actually solidifies dance

2056
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:26,560
position.
Sure.

2057
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:28,000
I agree with you.
Can I switch gears?

2058
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:28,960
Yeah.
I got to ask you about.

2059
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,910
You asked me about anything.
Joey Diaz.

2060
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,880
Tell me everything.
How did you meet Joe des [inaudible]

2061
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:35,560
[inaudible].
Then I want you to ask me this.

2062
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,830
I want you to ask me what my experience
with joy,

2063
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,200
but how did you meet him?
How did he come into the fold?

2064
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:44,690
I met Joey Diaz in the late nineties,
uh,

2065
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,280
at the comedy store.
I think I met him in like [inaudible] 96

2066
01:24:47,281 --> 01:24:48,720
or 97,
something like that.

2067
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,510
Uh,
right when Joey moved to La,

2068
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,100
we just started hanging around the
comedy store.

2069
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,190
We became friends and then I started
taking on the road with me.

2070
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,740
Like,
uh,

2071
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,870
the late nineties.
We've been best friends forever,

2072
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,330
so I know of Joey.
I don't know Joey.

2073
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,260
I've never met him.
Never met Joe.

2074
01:25:06,261 --> 01:25:09,760
Whenever I call him up right now,
TV and the whole bit and you know,

2075
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:12,250
I know him from,
from you and I see your podcast and all

2076
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:12,640
that,
but.

2077
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,560
And he's in the circles.
He does some Jujitsu,

2078
01:25:14,561 --> 01:25:16,690
he's funnier than hell and he's a
gangster.

2079
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:18,610
So I like him,
but I don't know anything about him.

2080
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,880
So he comes on my podcast now he has a
podcast,

2081
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:23,680
so of course my opening line to them as,
hey,

2082
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:24,670
how'd you get into pocket?
Right?

2083
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:27,280
I'm going to put here,
here's your plug for your podcast and

2084
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:28,780
we're going to go on and talk about my
agenda.

2085
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,490
So I say,
Joe,

2086
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:32,260
I say to him,
Joey,

2087
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:34,900
how'd you get into podcasting?
And his response,

2088
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:37,750
you know Chael Sonnen,
he wouldn't call me jail.

2089
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:40,330
It was always.
She calls me Joe Rogan.

2090
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:45,250
I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey
and senator Lee said her wig on fire.

2091
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:48,370
It's okay.
We got to.

2092
01:25:48,371 --> 01:25:50,110
There's two moving parts here.
First off,

2093
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:52,000
that is,
I don't know how that answers my

2094
01:25:52,001 --> 01:25:55,420
question of how,
but now I need to know the story here.

2095
01:25:55,421 --> 01:25:59,080
So we ties it all together with.
He went on something,

2096
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,790
just something,
he got an appearance.

2097
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:04,010
He told the story of mugging her a
hooker in New Jersey and setting her wig

2098
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:06,710
on fire and all of a sudden he blew up
overnight and he goes,

2099
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:08,120
yeah.
I realized people like the stores.

2100
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:11,180
I never knew that I had stories from the
part of the country.

2101
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:13,910
I'm in the neighborhood I grew up in.
I thought everybody had these doors.

2102
01:26:13,911 --> 01:26:14,531
He's like,
chill son.

2103
01:26:14,531 --> 01:26:17,060
And I thought I'd tell you I mogul
hooker and lighter wig on fire.

2104
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:17,511
You Go,
yeah,

2105
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:19,940
well I'm up 10 hookers and let 10 wigs
on fire.

2106
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,610
I was like,
I didn't know I had stories and then it

2107
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:23,750
just goes from there.

2108
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:25,880
And he starts telling me about.
So He.

2109
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:28,550
So he,
he ends up doing two years or 18 months

2110
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,420
and I said,
well,

2111
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,190
what kind of jam did you get in there?
And he said,

2112
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:32,330
well,
I was actually,

2113
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:33,860
I was doing the cop's job for them.
You know,

2114
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:35,330
the cops don't want drugs on the
streets.

2115
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:37,640
I went,
took two kilos off the streets form.

2116
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,430
This is how he presents it to me.
He goes,

2117
01:26:40,431 --> 01:26:40,950
yeah,
you know,

2118
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:41,210
the,
the,

2119
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:44,230
the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal.
Oh.

2120
01:26:44,231 --> 01:26:44,910
He said,
Oh,

2121
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,400
I,
I robbed two kilos.

2122
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,660
He goes,
and you know what else?

2123
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:50,300
Chael Sonnen,
I just happened to have a machine gun

2124
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:53,020
and I go,
I can see where that happened because

2125
01:26:53,021 --> 01:26:54,910
she is sometimes you just back into a
machine gun.

2126
01:26:54,911 --> 01:26:57,350
I had a machine gun with me and he goes,
but it's funny.

2127
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:58,700
I wasn't in trouble for the gun.

2128
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,170
I really wasn't that much trouble for
the drugs.

2129
01:27:01,171 --> 01:27:03,230
What they were upset about was the
kidnapping.

2130
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:04,311
I'm going,
okay,

2131
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:06,000
what,
what happened here?

2132
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:07,730
This is my intro to the guy.
I'm like,

2133
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:09,410
what?
What in the hell is this story?

2134
01:27:09,411 --> 01:27:10,880
You probably know the story,
but I did it.

2135
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,040
So he tells me the whole story.
He says,

2136
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:13,560
yeah,
but you know,

2137
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,050
kidnappings,
kind of a weird charge.

2138
01:27:15,051 --> 01:27:16,700
He goes,
when you and vandelay gotten that

2139
01:27:16,701 --> 01:27:19,700
scuffle in the ultimate fighter,
if I come and grab you and take you into

2140
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:23,490
the next room just to cool you down,
taking you into a room against your

2141
01:27:23,491 --> 01:27:24,590
will,
that's kidnapping.

2142
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:27,050
So I think like they got him on a
technicality jam,

2143
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:29,330
like what they're doing with Frank Mir.
Some of these guys were talking about

2144
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,710
and I said,
okay,

2145
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:31,880
is that what happened?
And he goes,

2146
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,520
no,
I duct taped the game.

2147
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,630
He's in my trunk.
And then I held him in the house for a

2148
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:38,390
week before I let him go.
Well then why didn't you tell me?

2149
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:43,550
Why did you bring up the initial example
of taking me next door and cooling me

2150
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:44,960
debt?
What that have to do?

2151
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:48,800
I still don't know because he's crazy.
It's funnier than hell.

2152
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:50,920
And I asked.
So I was trying to talk like some.

2153
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,350
See I try to do more of a Joe Rogan
experience.

2154
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,230
You're,
you're my idol.

2155
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:56,600
I try to do my show the way you do
yours,

2156
01:27:56,601 --> 01:27:58,730
but I'm not there yet.
It takes a while to build that audience.

2157
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:01,160
So I got a stick on MMA and pro
wrestling.

2158
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:03,020
I got to really stay in,
but I don't want that.

2159
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:04,460
I want just.
I want to just talk.

2160
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,400
You could just talk.
You.

2161
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,580
You definitely could just talk was I
bring these guys in.

2162
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,920
I'm trying to do a little more that I go
to Tmz,

2163
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:12,680
I see the local stuff,
I try to ask them pop culture questions.

2164
01:28:12,681 --> 01:28:16,910
So I dip my toe in politics with Joey
Obama had just made this new rule of

2165
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:20,060
going to the bathroom you want.
So I asked Joey about that and he goes,

2166
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,980
chill son.
And I've been taking a dump in the

2167
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:25,490
woman's bathroom since I'm five years
old and believe me,

2168
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:30,970
I have dealt with the consequences,
but he wasn't kidding Joe.

2169
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,630
That's what's made this.
It's a shoot.

2170
01:28:35,631 --> 01:28:38,990
He's being real.
And he tells me he is pro wrestling.

2171
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:39,621
He goes,
well,

2172
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:41,720
my mom used to own a restaurant so you
know,

2173
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:44,060
I kinda had.
I cleaned the bag and then I sit down in

2174
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:44,721
the women's.
He goes,

2175
01:28:44,721 --> 01:28:47,630
you know what happens if you drop,
you drop your coke on a men's bathroom

2176
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:47,840
floor.

2177
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,630
No,
I don't know.

2178
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:52,340
I don't do like,
I've tested positive for everything in

2179
01:28:52,341 --> 01:28:53,890
the world,
but coke was at one of them.

2180
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:55,520
I used.
Since you leave it there,

2181
01:28:55,521 --> 01:28:57,200
you know what happens if I drop my
coconut,

2182
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,050
a women's bathroom floor,
you'd get down and lick it up.

2183
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:01,580
That's what he.
He says,

2184
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:03,860
everybody's trying to say the women's
rooms cleaning he'd been used up,

2185
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:07,650
says he's five years old and he said,
and I have dealt with the consequences,

2186
01:29:07,651 --> 01:29:10,590
which I knew I want the answer to what
those were.

2187
01:29:10,591 --> 01:29:12,390
It's just,
it's like there's too many other things

2188
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:14,430
to talk to this guy,
but I got to get back to the hooker with

2189
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:16,740
the wig that he mugged.
I've known Joe.

2190
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:17,583
He was busy

2191
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:22,750
20 years and he's never stopped running
out of stories and they're all real

2192
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,740
people.
His wife is so fucking crazy that people

2193
01:29:27,741 --> 01:29:27,981
go,
oh,

2194
01:29:27,981 --> 01:29:29,870
that guy just comes on your show and
make stuff up.

2195
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:34,010
That's what people used to say when I
used to have them on these to say like

2196
01:29:34,011 --> 01:29:37,020
when we first started doing the podcasts
that I'm tired of that Joey Diaz Guy.

2197
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,420
He's lying.
He's just making things up.

2198
01:29:38,421 --> 01:29:41,390
Haters would say that,
but then people would come on his show

2199
01:29:41,391 --> 01:29:44,360
and substantiate.
He would call people up in New Jersey

2200
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:46,090
that he grew up with.
They would tell.

2201
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,130
He would go,
Tom,

2202
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:50,450
that fucking story about the time we lit
the whole [inaudible] word on fire and

2203
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:54,290
then they would tell the same story like
he's lived a movie,

2204
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:58,910
not a movie,
like an epic adventure series of novels.

2205
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,710
I kids life is insane.

2206
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,840
Well,
to qualify.

2207
01:30:01,841 --> 01:30:05,830
So he tells this story about Robin,
this guy with a machine gun that he just

2208
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,340
happened to have taken the two kilos off
the street during the cop's job for him,

2209
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:12,340
but then having the guy in his trunk
duct tape before I moved into the house

2210
01:30:12,341 --> 01:30:14,890
before I let him go.
He had that guy on his podcast.

2211
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,990
Yes.
He found him on social media,

2212
01:30:16,991 --> 01:30:18,880
tried to friend him or like him or
whatever you call it,

2213
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:19,810
on faith.
I'm a twitter guy,

2214
01:30:19,811 --> 01:30:22,660
but this was facebook guy ignored him
for about two years.

2215
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,420
Finally responded.
Now Joey's had them on his pockets.

2216
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:27,580
He says,
we catch up about once a month and he

2217
01:30:27,581 --> 01:30:27,910
goes,
yeah,

2218
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,920
and the guy was good people.
He never turned me in.

2219
01:30:29,921 --> 01:30:31,810
He said it was yet,
it was my partner in the whole thing.

2220
01:30:31,811 --> 01:30:34,120
The partner try to double cross me and
we stole the coke.

2221
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,520
Then he was going to steal it from me,
but I knew what time it was.

2222
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:39,130
That's an expression I'd never heard
before,

2223
01:30:39,131 --> 01:30:42,820
but I plan to take with me through my
next years in life,

2224
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,120
whenever.
Wherever you go.

2225
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,470
I knew what time it was.
I just thought that was a great line.

2226
01:30:47,471 --> 01:30:49,540
The whole thing was I asked him about
the gorilla.

2227
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:53,140
The gorilla had just got shot where they
killed him at the zoo and he says,

2228
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:54,040
you know what?
Chill Center.

2229
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:55,460
They don't give us the good gorillas.
I'm.

2230
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,550
I'm down at the zoo last week,
the gorillas,

2231
01:30:57,551 --> 01:30:59,830
they got their hair messed up.
They don't eat bananas.

2232
01:30:59,831 --> 01:31:03,040
They want chicken cutlets.
Shoot the FN gorilla.

2233
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:07,510
It's like you had no idea was going to
ask you that.

2234
01:31:07,511 --> 01:31:10,790
That was so spontaneously funny.
You know that news had just broken,

2235
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:11,950
right?
Then I was like,

2236
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:14,650
this is the guy.
This is a funny guy.

2237
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:15,940
No,
he's unbelievable.

2238
01:31:15,941 --> 01:31:17,920
He's the funniest person I've ever met
in my life.

2239
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,960
He's the funniest comedian I've ever
seen in my life.

2240
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,760
Well,
I've seen them live or you got to see

2241
01:31:21,761 --> 01:31:22,900
him live with.
How long have you.

2242
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:26,450
I'm here until tomorrow.
I'm gonna do fighter and the kid I got

2243
01:31:26,451 --> 01:31:27,440
to see.
Speaking of Qa,

2244
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:30,320
I got to see Adam Hunter last night live
and he lit it up.

2245
01:31:30,321 --> 01:31:32,660
Adam Hunter was very funny.
He was very funny.

2246
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:34,130
He's very good.
He's really good writer.

2247
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:36,730
He worked the whole crowd in he.
He made it a thing.

2248
01:31:36,731 --> 01:31:40,700
Any any sold the venue out is his real
intimate atmosphere at stratos for I

2249
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,680
would guess 100 seats.
A very small,

2250
01:31:42,681 --> 01:31:44,060
but it was packed.
That's perfect.

2251
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,700
Went right around the room.
I mean he rose.

2252
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,990
There's nothing off limits.
Women's jokes,

2253
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,030
gay jokes,
racial jokes,

2254
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:52,760
everything,
and it was awesome and possibly as

2255
01:31:52,761 --> 01:31:54,020
funny.
It's like who's going around to couple.

2256
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:54,920
Hey,
how'd you guys meet?

2257
01:31:54,921 --> 01:31:55,790
Hey,
how'd you guys meet?

2258
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:57,710
You know,
where'd you guys meet Jimmy at the UFC?

2259
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,300
You guys fight phase during the whole
thing there.

2260
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:00,100
A nerdy coupling.

2261
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,900
[inaudible].
Where'd you guys meet?

2262
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,270
Lenscrafters.
It's right.

2263
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,300
See,
brilliance is in it's simplicity.

2264
01:32:07,301 --> 01:32:09,910
You can use that line in school and not
even get a detention.

2265
01:32:09,911 --> 01:32:10,390
I mean,
that's a,

2266
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:14,020
that's a powerful and funny line.
And the teacher can even send you to the

2267
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:15,520
office for me.
Right?

2268
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:17,440
It's not me,
it's just bloody now.

2269
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:18,410
He's a funny dude.
He's,

2270
01:32:18,411 --> 01:32:21,370
he's,
I got in trouble for quoting one of his

2271
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:26,260
jokes during a fox broadcast,
like a Fox sports one.

2272
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:29,920
Who was the fighter that he was telling
a joke about?

2273
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,070
Um,
he said he comes from behind more than

2274
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:34,270
Lance Bass.
Yes.

2275
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:36,310
Who Was it?
Can't remember.

2276
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,350
But that was a funny line.
Yes.

2277
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,030
You use like a paper view though,
or.

2278
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:45,100
I think it was,
it was on fs one that was part of the

2279
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,390
problem.
Okay.

2280
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:47,800
It works.
Martin Kampmann.

2281
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:49,690
Yeah,
it was Martin Cameron and uh,

2282
01:32:49,691 --> 01:32:52,330
I just wanted to credit him because it
made me laugh so hard.

2283
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:54,340
That's why I said as my friend Adam
Hunter,

2284
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,590
so I kind of got away with it because it
wasn't.

2285
01:32:56,591 --> 01:32:59,360
My joke is if I had said it,
sure.

2286
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,031
Well here,
if we're playing,

2287
01:33:01,031 --> 01:33:02,770
if we're playing that game,
I can't tell one,

2288
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:04,300
but if I quote him,
maybe I can't.

2289
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:07,030
He sends me a text after the Orlando
shooting the very next day.

2290
01:33:07,031 --> 01:33:07,780
He says,
Hey man,

2291
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:09,730
let me know you're okay.
I heard there was a shooting at a gay

2292
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:10,810
club.
I just want to check on you.

2293
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:13,540
It's like,
now you got to do that in private.

2294
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:16,150
You
can do anything.

2295
01:33:16,151 --> 01:33:18,550
They want this loophole.
It's hilarious.

2296
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:20,350
I'm just reading that shit.
That's funny.

2297
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:22,090
I wonder how many other people you said
that too,

2298
01:33:22,091 --> 01:33:24,850
but the right mark for that because
that's funny.

2299
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,590
That's funny.
It is funny.

2300
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:27,980
Well,
that's a weird position.

2301
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:28,990
I believe in the rule,
Joe.

2302
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:31,570
If it's funny then you can do it.
Yes.

2303
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:32,830
Yeah.
Well both.

2304
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,850
Funny.
Subjective,

2305
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:35,110
right?
Like what's funded you?

2306
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,540
Other people might get offended and
that's one of the things that people who

2307
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:41,080
love to be recreationally outrage.
That's what they do.

2308
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:43,150
They'll find a joke and they'll say,
that's not funny to me.

2309
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:47,330
It's horribly offensive and it's
degrading and blah blah,

2310
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,330
and they'll come up with a bunch of
reasons why.

2311
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,550
It shouldn't be funny,
but if there's someone out there that's

2312
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:54,370
howling at the same time,
you're protesting the other person's

2313
01:33:54,371 --> 01:33:57,730
howling laughing,
then it did its job for you,

2314
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,620
for me.
You sent out a great tweet.

2315
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,150
You might.
It might've been as recently as

2316
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:03,460
yesterday,
but the for it was a two part.

2317
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:08,050
The first part said this country does.
This country has a mental health problem

2318
01:34:08,051 --> 01:34:13,051
disguised as a gun problem and this
country has a tyranny problem disguised

2319
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:14,590
as a security problem.

2320
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:16,690
It's a security problem and it went
crazy.

2321
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,330
Twitter lit up and when I'm reading that
I'm going,

2322
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:20,860
okay,
Joe's dip it in something here.

2323
01:34:20,861 --> 01:34:23,650
Joe Doesn't usually dip in,
but he's right.

2324
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:26,860
There was no way to say that that
statement is not right and it wasn't

2325
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:29,830
meant to be funny.
That was a very true and I thought a

2326
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:31,360
powerful statement by you.
Thank you.

2327
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,600
It's actually a couple of years old.
It's just a,

2328
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:36,370
it's just going around a lot.
People who are retweeting it.

2329
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:37,300
Okay.
Came back,

2330
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:40,960
but it's um,
there's no way you can't call what

2331
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:42,910
happened in Orlando,
a mental health problem.

2332
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:46,540
There's plenty of guns.
There are more guns than there are human

2333
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:49,570
beings in this country,
and if there was a gun problem,

2334
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:52,930
the way a lot of people like to pretend
there's a gun problem or the way they

2335
01:34:52,931 --> 01:34:54,460
like to,
I shouldn't say pretend because

2336
01:34:54,461 --> 01:34:56,000
obviously there's an issue.
Um,

2337
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,650
the way they like to categorize it.

2338
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,010
There would be people shooting people in
mass all day long.

2339
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:02,750
Every day.
It would be impossible to go out of the

2340
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:05,330
house without looking for gunfire.
That's not the case.

2341
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:09,580
Will you think about how many people are
there are and how many guns there are in

2342
01:35:09,581 --> 01:35:14,240
how statistically rare it is that these
things happen.

2343
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,470
It,
it shows you,

2344
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:20,300
and then you factor in how many of these
people are on anti depressants,

2345
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:23,240
how many of these people are being
weened off of antidepressants?

2346
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:27,170
Those numbers are terrified because when
you look at the correlation and the

2347
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:31,160
correlation does not equal causation is
there's a weird argument,

2348
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:36,430
but it's an undeniable factor that has
to be at least debated and discussed.

2349
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,160
There are so many fucking people in this
country on disassociating meds on things

2350
01:35:43,341 --> 01:35:48,341
that allow you to get away with you.
You could justify and do and act in

2351
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:53,030
horrific ways and not exactly know what
the fuck you're doing.

2352
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:58,180
That is one of the problems that's
associated with certain antidepressants

2353
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:01,310
and too dumb to not connect those two is
crazy and to not,

2354
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,280
and even if they're not medicated,
forget about the medication because the

2355
01:36:04,281 --> 01:36:08,450
medication is one issue with the type of
person that can go into a fucking school

2356
01:36:08,451 --> 01:36:11,150
and shoot a bunch of kids.
If you don't think that's a mental

2357
01:36:11,151 --> 01:36:12,350
illness issue,
oh,

2358
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:14,890
it's only a gun issue.
That's fucking crazy.

2359
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:17,450
It's not a gun issue.
That's like calling nine slash 11 a

2360
01:36:17,451 --> 01:36:18,560
plane issue.
Right?

2361
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:20,240
It's not.
It's not a gun issue.

2362
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:25,190
The gun factor is real.
There is a problem if psycho people and

2363
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:27,890
people with criminal records are people
that are mentally disturbed,

2364
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:29,000
combined guns,
yes.

2365
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:29,840
That's a problem.
You know,

2366
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:32,720
what else is the problem?
The fact that I can get a fucking,

2367
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:35,420
I can get a gun and I don't even know
how to use it.

2368
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:36,860
That's a problem.
Sure.

2369
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:38,780
You have to have a license to drive a
car.

2370
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:41,660
If someone has to sit with you that you
have to take these turns,

2371
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:44,810
you have to turn right here,
you have to fully stop at the stop sign.

2372
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,460
You have to do all these things.
And if you don't do it,

2373
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:48,110
don't.
You don't get your driver's license.

2374
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:50,270
Oh,
you have to do is not be a criminal and

2375
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:51,104
you'd get a gun.
Right?

2376
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:52,310
That is fucking crazy.

2377
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,440
And at any age two.
And that's relevant.

2378
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,240
Uh,
my nephew is eight years old.

2379
01:36:56,290 --> 01:37:00,740
When he got last Christmas,
he got a gun and we live in the country.

2380
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:02,720
That's normal.
Kids have guns by the time they're eight

2381
01:37:02,721 --> 01:37:03,880
years old at three,
four years old.

2382
01:37:03,881 --> 01:37:05,660
They're starting with bb guns.
They advanced to appellate.

2383
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:07,700
You've got a shotgun.
Some parts of the world go,

2384
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:08,481
man.
That's insane.

2385
01:37:08,481 --> 01:37:09,380
You gave a kid a gun.
Well,

2386
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:10,490
where we live out in the car.
Yes.

2387
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,440
The kid has the gun at the other side of
it though,

2388
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,110
there is no crimes where I come from,
done with a gun,

2389
01:37:15,111 --> 01:37:17,630
whether a guy's doing a simple robbery
and I don't mean to dismiss that,

2390
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:21,620
but in the in the eyes of murder,
it is never and one of the reasons that

2391
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:25,100
we maintain is when you have guns and
you grow up with guns,

2392
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:28,100
you learn the dangers of guns.
You never play with those things.

2393
01:37:28,101 --> 01:37:31,460
You never point those things at anybody.
When you're out shooting watermelons and

2394
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:34,100
pop cans or whatever it may be.
You learn real fast.

2395
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:38,450
This is why I don't pull a gun.
This is why I don't do this because we

2396
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:40,130
don't.
We don't know anything about the things

2397
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:42,950
like the cities in New York and all
these people that are trying to take the

2398
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:44,540
guns away.
We don't know anything about that out in

2399
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:45,620
the country.
Never.

2400
01:37:45,621 --> 01:37:48,530
We don't have any gun problems and
everybody's got them.

2401
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,220
Well,
don't you also think that living in a

2402
01:37:51,221 --> 01:37:54,580
place like the country where everybody
does have guns,

2403
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:57,300
that is very different environment than
living in a city.

2404
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:02,370
If everybody had guns in the city,
you have so much more tension going on.

2405
01:38:02,371 --> 01:38:03,870
It's so much.
It's so much different.

2406
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:06,030
Like the environment's different like
that.

2407
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:09,480
I don't necessarily think it would be
great if New York City had as many guns

2408
01:38:09,481 --> 01:38:11,400
per capita as Oregon.
Sure,

2409
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:14,130
sure.
In your original point on this is the

2410
01:38:14,131 --> 01:38:18,330
only thing that stops you from getting a
gun is having a felony is like,

2411
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:20,940
well that makes sense and nobody's
disputing that,

2412
01:38:20,941 --> 01:38:22,790
but there's got to be a few more things.
To your point,

2413
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:25,160
we need to find out if you're medicaid
as simple drug tests.

2414
01:38:25,161 --> 01:38:26,430
This is pretty quick.
You know,

2415
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:29,640
the NRA is real big that a guy gets a
gun today because he might need to say,

2416
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,440
well no,
the guy's got to plan ahead.

2417
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,880
It's just like a driver's license.
Maybe.

2418
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,160
Maybe the 16 year old has a date on
Saturday,

2419
01:38:35,161 --> 01:38:37,920
but if he doesn't have the license and
he's going to have to postpone the date

2420
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:40,590
because there needs to be more things
than just simply going,

2421
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:41,300
you know,
let,

2422
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:44,250
let me run your fingerprints and if
something comes back to your point,

2423
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,330
are you on drugs and medication?
How about a train of thought?

2424
01:38:46,331 --> 01:38:47,880
I've never heard anybody make that
argument before,

2425
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:50,970
but I love that analogy.
You have to get a license for a car.

2426
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:52,920
It's pretty simple process but you have
to do it.

2427
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:55,560
Why you shifted it with a gun too
because people need to know why you

2428
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:59,760
don't use guns 100 percent.
I mean you have to get a hunter safety,

2429
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:04,680
a certificate if you want to hunt and if
you want to use the gun and you know

2430
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:07,740
it's really,
it's very detailed in most states.

2431
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,600
You have to have one in many states at
least.

2432
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:11,100
Actually,
I don't even think you have to have in

2433
01:39:11,101 --> 01:39:12,780
California,
but you,

2434
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,780
which is weird because California is
like one of the most restrictive states

2435
01:39:15,781 --> 01:39:17,710
when it comes to firearms,
but you,

2436
01:39:17,711 --> 01:39:20,730
you have to go through this long
difficult course and you have to pass

2437
01:39:20,731 --> 01:39:24,030
tests and you have to actually know what
the fuck you're doing and if you don't

2438
01:39:24,031 --> 01:39:26,640
you don't get your hunter safety
certificate and then you can't.

2439
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,140
You can't hunt,
can't get a license,

2440
01:39:28,141 --> 01:39:28,381
right?
Yeah.

2441
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:33,381
You can't get a license and I think that
what the NRA does is they take a hard

2442
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:38,370
stance on the side of promoting guns and
they don't move.

2443
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:42,570
Not only do they not budge,
they almost are unreasonable in their

2444
01:39:42,571 --> 01:39:46,590
position,
but I feel like that is because the left

2445
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:50,070
is so unreasonable when anything goes
on,

2446
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:54,270
they immediately want to ban guns and
take guns away that it's not.

2447
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,450
It's not feasible at this day and people
are like,

2448
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:58,231
well,
we're going to do that.

2449
01:39:58,231 --> 01:40:00,300
Australia,
Australia is 20 million people.

2450
01:40:00,301 --> 01:40:02,010
It's the size of the continental United
States.

2451
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:05,730
To Equate Australia with the United
States is insane.

2452
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,970
There's just way too many people here.
It's a completely different and by the

2453
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:10,410
way,
they didn't ban guns in Australia.

2454
01:40:10,411 --> 01:40:12,150
People hunt with guns.
You can get guns,

2455
01:40:12,151 --> 01:40:13,380
you can register guns.
You get them.

2456
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:16,290
You'd go to.
You'd be belong part of hunting clubs

2457
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:18,390
like they do in Europe.
You keep them stored in lockers.

2458
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:22,590
It's not a full on band.
On firearms is just much more

2459
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:25,830
restrictive.
The NRA is trying to stop restrictions

2460
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,810
and the reason why they're trying to
stop restrictions because you know when

2461
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:33,690
anything goes on television,
it's very disingenuous for someone to go

2462
01:40:33,691 --> 01:40:37,830
on television after some sort of a
massacre and not bring up all the

2463
01:40:37,831 --> 01:40:40,680
factors,
not bring up psych meds,

2464
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:44,070
not bring up mental health,
not talk about the correlation between

2465
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:49,490
raising kids in abusive households and
having children grow up with this,

2466
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:52,710
these horrible lives,
and then they go on and become fucking

2467
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,410
psychopaths.

2468
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:55,030
Sure,
there's a correlation there.

2469
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:59,440
It's not simply whether or not the kid
had the tool to do the job.

2470
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,330
It's like,
why the fuck did they want to do that in

2471
01:41:01,331 --> 01:41:04,030
the first place?
And then you find out so many of these

2472
01:41:04,031 --> 01:41:05,710
cases,
like this guy in Orlando,

2473
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:08,680
the FBI had them on a watch list just a
couple of years ago twice.

2474
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:09,310
Yeah.
I mean,

2475
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:10,240
come on man,
that,

2476
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:12,910
that fucking kid in Colorado that killed
everybody at the movie theater.

2477
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:14,950
They knew that guy was out of his
fucking mind.

2478
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,730
He had talked about killing a bunch of
people and there's a lot of those cases

2479
01:41:18,731 --> 01:41:22,450
where they get ignored and that's a
giant issue and I don't know how to

2480
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:26,560
solve that issue because what do you do
when someone comes along and says,

2481
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,660
Hey,
I'm thinking about going into a movie

2482
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:30,640
theater and killing a bunch of people.
I'm just kidding.

2483
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:31,503
You know,
like what do you,

2484
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,090
what do you,
do?

2485
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:34,810
You know how I'm going to go buy your
first statement and lock you up forever?

2486
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:36,010
You know,
I don't know.

2487
01:41:36,011 --> 01:41:37,600
I don't know what to do there.
And I,

2488
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:42,070
I think there's a gigantic argument when
it comes to gun violence in this

2489
01:41:42,071 --> 01:41:44,260
contract,
but there's a gigantic argument when it

2490
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:46,840
comes to mental illness and we're
pushing that one aside.

2491
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,600
Yeah.
And I think they just do it at the wrong

2492
01:41:48,601 --> 01:41:48,991
time,
you know,

2493
01:41:48,991 --> 01:41:51,210
they get emotions involved.
Jfk made a statement,

2494
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,500
uh,
back when he was president,

2495
01:41:52,501 --> 01:41:56,220
never let a good crisis go to waste.
So it is believed by politicians.

2496
01:41:56,221 --> 01:41:58,230
When you have a crisis,
that's when you go on the attack.

2497
01:41:58,231 --> 01:41:59,820
But that's when the emotions are the
highest.

2498
01:41:59,821 --> 01:42:02,670
I disagree with this statement.
It's a good time to get your agenda out

2499
01:42:02,671 --> 01:42:04,950
there,
but you're just pissing people off and

2500
01:42:04,951 --> 01:42:06,310
you're entrenched in them in their own
views.

2501
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:08,190
A great time to bring up the gun
argument.

2502
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:10,470
I'm pro gun,
but I do understand.

2503
01:42:10,471 --> 01:42:11,850
Look,
there's some room to give her.

2504
01:42:11,851 --> 01:42:15,060
I love what you said about a licensed.
You relate that to a driving a car.

2505
01:42:15,061 --> 01:42:17,760
It makes perfect sense.
Bring it when emotions are a little bit

2506
01:42:17,761 --> 01:42:18,780
less comfortable and go,
hey,

2507
01:42:18,781 --> 01:42:20,790
listen,
let's make sure we do this.

2508
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:23,790
And if you're worried about your safety,
kind of get a little bit proactive here.

2509
01:42:23,791 --> 01:42:26,280
Start the process that you can have a
gun if that's what you want to do.

2510
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:28,790
But I don't agree.
I think that they're,

2511
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:29,700
they're,
they're wrong.

2512
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:32,160
Following Jeff K's model that he said in
1964,

2513
01:42:32,161 --> 01:42:35,310
I think here in 2016,
let emotions die down a little bit,

2514
01:42:35,311 --> 01:42:37,440
let not people not be pissed on one side
or the other.

2515
01:42:37,441 --> 01:42:39,960
Worried about protecting themselves and
their family were worried that

2516
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,640
something's going to happen to
themselves with their family.

2517
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:44,010
You get good people with really
different views here.

2518
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:48,420
I think that they're misplacing jfk
philosophy in my opinion.

2519
01:42:48,421 --> 01:42:50,730
In 2016,
let things die down a little bit and

2520
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:51,564
then bring it up.

2521
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:54,380
Yeah,
and there's also this weird adherence,

2522
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:59,410
concrete adherence to the bill of rights
and you know the second amendment.

2523
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,490
I mean,
yeah,

2524
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,820
I think that people should look.
I don't think if there's only three of

2525
01:43:04,821 --> 01:43:05,870
us in this world.
All right,

2526
01:43:05,871 --> 01:43:07,570
you,
me and Jamie were the only ones.

2527
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:09,740
If Jamie came along and said nobody
could have guns,

2528
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,900
I think we would get together and go,
fuck that guy.

2529
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:14,600
Who's this guy to tell us what we can
and can't do.

2530
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:18,590
That same thought process could be
applied to 300 million people.

2531
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,670
It just.
I don't agree that a grown human being

2532
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:26,060
should be able to tell another grown
human being what they can and can't do

2533
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,940
as long as it's not like if you say,
hey joe,

2534
01:43:28,941 --> 01:43:32,390
I'm thinking about starting a fucking
nuclear power plant in your backyard and

2535
01:43:32,391 --> 01:43:34,880
I'm pretty sure it know what I'm doing,
but if we're going to have to move to

2536
01:43:34,881 --> 01:43:35,900
the middle of the ocean,
right,

2537
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:40,640
well then we got a problem and you could
sort of apply that logic to guns.

2538
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:41,451
You say,
well,

2539
01:43:41,451 --> 01:43:42,110
you know,
if you,

2540
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:45,170
if you're a fucking gun nut and you'd
like to shoot guns off in your backyard

2541
01:43:45,171 --> 01:43:47,600
and you know,
you might ricochet one and fucking shoot

2542
01:43:47,601 --> 01:43:51,210
my dog or something,
then it becomes a safety issue and a

2543
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:56,470
health issue.
But it's hard to justify using the words

2544
01:43:57,621 --> 01:44:02,621
of people that lived in the fucking 17
hundreds when it comes to today with the

2545
01:44:03,561 --> 01:44:07,190
kind of guns that we have with the kind
of society that we have with the kind of

2546
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,350
just our,
our,

2547
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:10,820
our across the board,
our legal system,

2548
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:11,740
our,
our,

2549
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:13,400
our,
our system of government,

2550
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:14,750
representative,
government,

2551
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:19,160
all that stuff is fucking bananas in the
world of 2016.

2552
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:22,880
Representative government has no place
in a world where everyone has social

2553
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:26,360
media where everyone can be represented
instantaneously.

2554
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,590
You don't have to get on a fucking horse
and take a parchment across the country

2555
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:34,880
to hand it to some dude in a powdered
wig that's old that we don't need that

2556
01:44:34,881 --> 01:44:35,480
anymore.

2557
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,090
So when you start talking about things
that are in the bill of rights and

2558
01:44:38,091 --> 01:44:41,360
things that are in the constitution,
ge think it's time to update that

2559
01:44:41,361 --> 01:44:44,170
fucking ancient piece of shit.
I mean it's,

2560
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:46,190
it was great.
They had amazing insight.

2561
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:48,860
They were brilliant people.
We owe them everything.

2562
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:52,730
This experiment of self government,
the United States of America was founded

2563
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:55,400
on,
is a fantastic invention and it's one of

2564
01:44:55,401 --> 01:44:59,720
the reasons why so much art and
creativity and innovation and freedom

2565
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:04,820
come from this part of the world,
but to rely on the exact words written

2566
01:45:04,821 --> 01:45:09,440
with a fucking feather back when people
were taken wooden boats across the

2567
01:45:09,441 --> 01:45:11,540
ocean,
hoping they wouldn't get eaten by

2568
01:45:11,541 --> 01:45:14,540
Indians when they land in here.
I mean the native Americans.

2569
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,690
Sorry.
Um,

2570
01:45:15,870 --> 01:45:16,703
it's,
it's,

2571
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:20,340
I just think it's ridiculous to say
anything we're not supposed to know.

2572
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:23,150
So it was right up there with retard.
And could you say homo?

2573
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:24,340
I think he's still,
say Homo.

2574
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,340
Homo sapiens.

2575
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:29,020
I did not know that.
Politicians try to be correct all the

2576
01:45:29,021 --> 01:45:31,360
time and say African American.
But that term is wrong.

2577
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:32,500
It's black.
Yes.

2578
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:34,300
Not all.
Not all blacks are Africans.

2579
01:45:34,301 --> 01:45:35,230
A lot of people from Haiti.
Yeah.

2580
01:45:35,231 --> 01:45:39,580
To your point that people have this
absolute fetish for the constitution.

2581
01:45:39,581 --> 01:45:42,490
No matter how many times we've amended
over the years and it extends to the

2582
01:45:42,491 --> 01:45:44,380
bill of a bill of rights to it and they
need to take,

2583
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:45,670
you know,
you bring up a feather,

2584
01:45:45,671 --> 01:45:47,200
but,
and that's accurate.

2585
01:45:47,201 --> 01:45:49,270
They sign it with a feather,
but they were also married to their

2586
01:45:49,271 --> 01:45:51,460
cousin and they bathed once a week and
they had slaves.

2587
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,990
There you go.
And it's like,

2588
01:45:52,991 --> 01:45:54,700
hey guys,
things changed.

2589
01:45:54,701 --> 01:45:56,950
So these guys did their level best at
that time,

2590
01:45:56,951 --> 01:45:59,520
but they couldn't see the world and it,
you know,

2591
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:02,080
in perpetuity.
And then assign it is no matter how many

2592
01:46:02,081 --> 01:46:05,110
times we've amended the constitution,
you guys still have a fetish that this

2593
01:46:05,111 --> 01:46:08,530
was like the Gospel.
This wasn't touched by the hand of God.

2594
01:46:08,531 --> 01:46:10,930
This was written by knuckleheads with
eighth grade educations.

2595
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:11,990
Yeah.
And just do what?

2596
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:14,890
And the thing about the bill of rights,
the reason why they cling to that second

2597
01:46:14,891 --> 01:46:19,000
amendment is because it does state that
you have the right to bear arms.

2598
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:21,340
So they got it.
It's written down.

2599
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:22,100
It's all right.

2600
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:25,220
Sure we got it.
And people also love the basis behind

2601
01:46:25,221 --> 01:46:26,960
it.
It wasn't about hunter and gatherer like

2602
01:46:26,961 --> 01:46:28,070
some people say it was about,
look,

2603
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:32,540
if our government has guns,
then we have guns so that we can always

2604
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:35,840
overtake our government should we need
to now in the world of tanks and

2605
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:37,580
aircraft and everything.
Of course that doesn't.

2606
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:39,860
That doesn't hold,
but that's the part that people like.

2607
01:46:39,861 --> 01:46:42,320
They don't want to give their government
the power of the people don't have.

2608
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,590
That is a wonderful philosophy,
but it's.

2609
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:46,660
It's kind of outgrown itself.
It has

2610
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,770
ron itself in the United States of
America in 2016,

2611
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:52,650
but if the shit hits the fan and it
absolutely could.

2612
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:57,830
We are one natural disaster away from
chaos at all times and that is something

2613
01:46:58,051 --> 01:47:00,090
that has happened all throughout human
history.

2614
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:04,140
There have been gigantic asteroidal
impacts.

2615
01:47:04,141 --> 01:47:07,830
There have been super volcanoes.
There have been tidal waves.

2616
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:09,930
There's been a lot of shit that happens.
Then all of a sudden,

2617
01:47:09,931 --> 01:47:12,300
chaos mean we saw what happened with
Katrina.

2618
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:17,540
Katrina hit and there was looting and
rioting and chaos and people have the

2619
01:47:17,641 --> 01:47:21,810
right to defend themselves and protect
themselves in that kind of situation.

2620
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:25,950
When people go crazy,
then you factor in the possibility of

2621
01:47:25,951 --> 01:47:29,370
government going crazy.
That is just as much of a possibility.

2622
01:47:29,371 --> 01:47:32,790
It's happened all throughout history.
It's happening in Russia right now.

2623
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:36,090
Sure.
Russia is being run by fucking gangsters

2624
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:38,010
and not the sun and Kai.
Sure.

2625
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:39,220
A different kind of gangs.
Right?

2626
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:40,680
I mean,
Putin is a murderer.

2627
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:42,570
He's a tyrant for sure.
One hundred percent.

2628
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,710
Yeah.
I mean,

2629
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:46,970
I'm not an effective leader for,
for all the wrong word,

2630
01:47:46,971 --> 01:47:48,030
but yeah,
he is effective.

2631
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:49,370
Yeah.
Uh,

2632
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:50,131
I,
I just,

2633
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:53,910
uh,
I think there is an argument that when

2634
01:47:53,911 --> 01:47:58,050
people have ultimate power,
they also have massive potential for

2635
01:47:58,051 --> 01:48:00,660
corruption.
We see that today with the Clinton

2636
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:02,130
campaign,
this,

2637
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:04,650
this,
this nonsense with the fucking emails

2638
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:09,651
and they'll classify data that she had
inadvertently or purposely sent through

2639
01:48:10,921 --> 01:48:15,360
email and then the difference between
her take on it and what the FBI's take

2640
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:17,820
on it was like this clearly lying going
on.

2641
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:21,540
There's clearly corruption going on
because clearly people protecting her

2642
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:26,220
and that kind of corruption where it
wouldn't apply to you and it wouldn't

2643
01:48:26,221 --> 01:48:27,540
apply to me.
We would go to jail.

2644
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:28,350
Sure.
If we,

2645
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:33,350
if we sent those same emails,
if we were involved in the transfer of

2646
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:38,481
top secret information through erroneous
fucking pathways or however the fuck she

2647
01:48:41,071 --> 01:48:41,860
did it,
and I'm not,

2648
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,580
I don't exactly know the specifics,
but if we did any of those things,

2649
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:49,800
we would most likely be convicted and we
would most likely at least get find a

2650
01:48:49,801 --> 01:48:51,560
massive amount of money,
but more likely.

2651
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,720
Sure.
Martha,

2652
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:55,250
Martha Stewart went to jail just for
lying to the FBI.

2653
01:48:55,251 --> 01:48:56,830
You know,
now is in that same jam.

2654
01:48:56,831 --> 01:48:59,830
The FBI saying they didn't look into it.
That whole thing is very for gazy.

2655
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:00,280
Yeah,
no,

2656
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:03,370
that whole thing is very corrupt and I
think that call me at the FBI's a

2657
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:06,250
reasonable guy or are however,
I tend to believe him,

2658
01:49:06,251 --> 01:49:09,070
but that was never a fair shake.
Obama stays out of the whole thing.

2659
01:49:09,071 --> 01:49:13,990
Then he finally comes in a law lynch.
Loretta Lynch finally comes in and says,

2660
01:49:13,991 --> 01:49:15,280
well,
we're going to honor whatever the FBI

2661
01:49:15,281 --> 01:49:17,350
says,
and then four days later the FBI drops

2662
01:49:17,351 --> 01:49:17,981
the news.
It's like,

2663
01:49:17,981 --> 01:49:18,491
guys,
this is.

2664
01:49:18,491 --> 01:49:19,840
Forget this has been going on for a
year.

2665
01:49:20,030 --> 01:49:21,610
You know,
I'll tell you something else you know

2666
01:49:21,611 --> 01:49:23,860
who looks weak in the whole thing is the
FBI.

2667
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:27,400
These guys are supposed to be great.
We put 40 people on the Hillary Clinton

2668
01:49:27,401 --> 01:49:29,380
place to put that in perspective for the
listeners,

2669
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:34,590
for people were assigned to Al Capone 10
times the amount and it took them one

2670
01:49:34,781 --> 01:49:37,630
year of having the evidence to make a
ruling.

2671
01:49:37,631 --> 01:49:38,320
I mean,
come on,

2672
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,390
that's weak and the same thing's going
on with Isis.

2673
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,810
We're supposed to have this great
military and no offense to the people

2674
01:49:43,811 --> 01:49:45,190
that serve,
but offense to the people that are

2675
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:47,460
handcuffing our.
Our military isis,

2676
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:48,040
when I first

2677
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,510
had heard about them for the very first
time was 200 members strong.

2678
01:49:52,810 --> 01:49:57,130
Now they are 4,000 strong and weak.
Still can't stop these guys and we're

2679
01:49:57,131 --> 01:49:58,210
supposed to be the best.
Look.

2680
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:00,100
Of course we could.
We just don't,

2681
01:50:00,101 --> 01:50:03,490
but it makes us look weak.
That would not happen in Russia.

2682
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:06,400
Nobody attacks the Russians.
If you attack poot and you will be

2683
01:50:06,401 --> 01:50:08,470
fighting Putin right now,
no permission,

2684
01:50:08,471 --> 01:50:09,940
no congress,
no bs.

2685
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,920
You want to go,
you're going to go with Russia,

2686
01:50:11,921 --> 01:50:12,770
and that's why nobody

2687
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,200
does.
I think you're right.

2688
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:18,580
I think you're definitely right,
and when there's direct evidence of

2689
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:22,060
Clinton's statements versus the FBI
statements,

2690
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:24,160
Clinton saying,
I only used one device.

2691
01:50:24,161 --> 01:50:29,161
FBI saying choose multiple devices.
No Clinton saying that no classified or

2692
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:31,960
top secret documents were shared or
leaked.

2693
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:34,180
FBI saying hundreds,
hundreds,

2694
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,670
hundreds and deleted.
Yeah,

2695
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:37,540
it's all fucked.
It's all fucked,

2696
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:39,970
but that's corruption and that he
thinks,

2697
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:42,760
and this is not the kind of corruption
that we need to be absolutely terrified

2698
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:46,330
of like they're going to come and steal
our children and take all our money away

2699
01:50:46,331 --> 01:50:48,370
and and fucking shoot anybody who talks
back,

2700
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:52,750
that's not that level of corruption,
but it's a slippery slope with any

2701
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:54,730
corruption.
If the laws don't apply to you because

2702
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:58,030
your name is Hillary Clinton,
but the law applies to Chilson under Joe

2703
01:50:58,030 --> 01:50:59,260
Rogan.
That's nonsense.

2704
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:01,330
That's not,
that's not the world that we want.

2705
01:51:01,730 --> 01:51:06,160
That's the real problem.
When someone is outside of the law or

2706
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:09,310
the law respects them in a different way
that it respects you,

2707
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,760
that's not good,
and that's why the second amendment

2708
01:51:12,761 --> 01:51:17,110
exists is second amendment exists to
stop fuckery because people are crazy

2709
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:18,340
and when people say,
Whoa,

2710
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:20,980
it's about muskets and it's not.
It's not.

2711
01:51:22,030 --> 01:51:24,550
It's for a militia.
It's only the guns or no,

2712
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:25,481
no,
no.

2713
01:51:25,481 --> 01:51:29,830
It's to prevent this kind of shit from
getting completely out of hand.

2714
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,000
It's prevent the government from taking
over and allow people to form a

2715
01:51:35,111 --> 01:51:36,100
resistance.
Sure.

2716
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:36,970
To be honest.

2717
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:37,620
Yeah.
Hey.

2718
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:40,250
So many people think that trump's crazy
and he's going to lead us into warrants

2719
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:45,260
like guys sometime read the art of war.
Just read the art of work is the best

2720
01:51:45,701 --> 01:51:48,780
general never fires a shot.
Ever poot and hasn't had a whip.

2721
01:51:48,781 --> 01:51:50,650
A lot of vast.
No poodle kill you if he needs to,

2722
01:51:50,651 --> 01:51:53,410
but he hasn't had.
He took over a part of the Ukraine,

2723
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:54,940
didn't kill a person.
He rolled in.

2724
01:51:54,941 --> 01:51:57,300
He said he wanted it and now he has a
part of the Ukraine k,

2725
01:51:57,550 --> 01:51:59,710
that's leadership.
He aligned,

2726
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:01,990
but it's late.
I'm not saying this is good,

2727
01:52:01,991 --> 01:52:04,310
but that's what a leader does.
A leader makes a decision.

2728
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:06,190
He goes in and takes her and he didn't
have to kill anybody.

2729
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:09,490
The best general never fires a shot.
Donald trump isn't planning to go and

2730
01:52:09,491 --> 01:52:13,210
with people he's planning to make people
think he will whip them,

2731
01:52:13,211 --> 01:52:15,580
which is why he's not going to get us
into wars and people.

2732
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:19,660
A lot of people don't see that and trump
can't come out and reveal this big

2733
01:52:19,661 --> 01:52:20,351
curtain.
Or people go,

2734
01:52:20,351 --> 01:52:22,390
oh well the whole thing's a joke.
He can't do that.

2735
01:52:22,391 --> 01:52:25,120
So he's got to stand this ground,
take people saying he's crazy.

2736
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:26,370
Hope that enough.
Uh,

2737
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,270
enough people get it to vote them into
office,

2738
01:52:28,271 --> 01:52:30,640
but that's all he's doing.
He's going around saying it's our way or

2739
01:52:30,641 --> 01:52:33,520
the highway where the economic power
will the military power.

2740
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,740
We do things right and you're gonna do
it our way and we're not going to do a

2741
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:37,990
lot of compromising.
When you align like that,

2742
01:52:37,991 --> 01:52:40,090
you look at North Korea,
all the craziest they do there.

2743
01:52:40,091 --> 01:52:42,250
They scare everybody.
For years we've paid a bunch of money.

2744
01:52:42,251 --> 01:52:45,290
Bill Clinton paid them 8 billion.
George Bush paid them six and a half

2745
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:45,651
billion.
I mean,

2746
01:52:45,651 --> 01:52:46,010
it doesn't matter

2747
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,050
if you're Democrat or Republican,
you're paying these knuckleheads for

2748
01:52:48,051 --> 01:52:49,880
making straight.
They've never fired a shot.

2749
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:54,170
They just understand the art of war.
Talked to whoever talks stuff is the

2750
01:52:54,171 --> 01:52:57,800
toughest on the playground.
Everybody listening to this had a tough

2751
01:52:57,801 --> 01:52:58,421
guy in school.
Hey,

2752
01:52:58,421 --> 01:53:01,010
what was the toughest guy in school?
Everybody listening to this right now

2753
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:02,930
can go on.
Take that guy.

2754
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,180
They all know.
I'd ask them a follow up question.

2755
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:08,060
Did you ever see him getting a fight?
And all of them are going,

2756
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:08,970
no,
no.

2757
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:10,640
Who'd fight him?
He was the toughest guy in school.

2758
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:13,130
Whoever talks the toughest is the
toughest,

2759
01:53:13,131 --> 01:53:15,950
and those rules don't change from the
playground to the octagon,

2760
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,320
to the White House.
They don't change the best.

2761
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:20,060
General never fires a shot.

2762
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:23,330
When I was in high school,
the toughest kid beat the fuck out of

2763
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:25,230
everybody.
My name is frank piece.

2764
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,040
He was fucking huge.
It's most likely on steroids.

2765
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:31,570
He was a gigantic fuck.
He was so terrified.

2766
01:53:31,571 --> 01:53:35,930
My sister dated him for awhile.
He used to imagine how have your sister

2767
01:53:35,931 --> 01:53:37,400
date the toughest guy in the school?
Oh,

2768
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:40,190
he was a gorilla.
He used to be able to remember those

2769
01:53:40,191 --> 01:53:42,280
universal machines and where they had
the stack,

2770
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:44,540
what was the stack like?
Two 50 or something like that.

2771
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:48,050
He could bench the whole stack like
several times and everybody was like,

2772
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:49,300
whoa.
He does the stack.

2773
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:51,560
He does that.
He had giant stretch marks all over his

2774
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:53,920
tits and he was like 17 with these
things.

2775
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,030
It is most likely a steroids.
Pretty sure.

2776
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:57,200
Well,
I ran into a many,

2777
01:53:57,201 --> 01:53:59,060
many years later.
He's a great guy by the way.

2778
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:02,690
And um,
he was quite a bit smaller when I ran

2779
01:54:02,691 --> 01:54:03,680
into him many years later.
Like,

2780
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:05,150
Oh,
where's the

2781
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:07,940
rest of you?
But you know,

2782
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:10,910
that was back when people really didn't
even understand steroids.

2783
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:12,530
It wasn't a,
there wasn't a lot of people on them,

2784
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,830
but my point being toughest kid in my
school beat the fuck out.

2785
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:19,460
Everybody went to a college party and
beat the fuck out of a bunch of guys.

2786
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,900
That'll do it.
Yeah.

2787
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:23,210
He knocked down the nation.
That'll carry over.

2788
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:26,090
He was a brick shit house that kid,
but yeah,

2789
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:27,350
but I understand what you're saying.
Sure.

2790
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:29,780
This Donald Trump thing,
which which is interesting to me,

2791
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:35,110
is that what he's done is he's gotten
the media to work for him because he

2792
01:54:35,901 --> 01:54:39,020
found a weakness in what they do.
Would they like to do is I'd like to

2793
01:54:39,021 --> 01:54:42,290
talk shit with the media likes to do is
they look to find something that they

2794
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:46,400
feel like is going to be embarrassing or
something that they can focus on and

2795
01:54:46,401 --> 01:54:51,401
really drone on and on about it,
but with him he owns it and it's similar

2796
01:54:51,681 --> 01:54:54,980
to what you were talking about with
promoting yourself and promoting

2797
01:54:54,981 --> 01:54:55,880
yourself as a fighter.

2798
01:54:56,090 --> 01:55:00,410
He's promoting himself in a lot of the
ways the same way.

2799
01:55:00,411 --> 01:55:02,270
Kind of the you would do.
I mean,

2800
01:55:02,271 --> 01:55:06,980
what he's doing is he's not apologizing.
He's saying provocative things and

2801
01:55:06,981 --> 01:55:11,090
because of that he gets more air time
than anybody else.

2802
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:13,760
By far,
I mean it's not even close.

2803
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:18,710
All the other guys in the Republican,
the Republican candidates,

2804
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:21,350
they were all playing second fiddle.
They were all trying to catch up.

2805
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,290
They were even trying to do his thing
like Marco Rubio was making fun of his

2806
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:27,590
hands and what does he do?
He turns into a big Dick joke.

2807
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,690
She's like,
don't want my.

2808
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:30,920
I'm fine in that department.
Don't want right.

2809
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:32,510
I'm fine in that department,
and everybody's like,

2810
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:33,590
Hey,
he's holding it.

2811
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:35,990
He's talking about his dick.
This is amazing,

2812
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:41,230
and it got him even more fans.
I think people are tired of what the

2813
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:42,500
game is right now.

2814
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:44,940
What the is right now.
As a guy gets on a podium,

2815
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,420
he says a bunch of things that you know
and I know will fucking never happen.

2816
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,550
Obama,
everybody was hope and change.

2817
01:55:50,551 --> 01:55:53,070
Hope and change.
He's going to close Guantanamo Bay.

2818
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:56,580
He's going to get us out of Iraq.
He's going to get us out of Afghanistan.

2819
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,910
We're still in Iraq.
We're still in Afghanistan.

2820
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,270
Guantanamo base.
Still here.

2821
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,560
No hope.
No change.

2822
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:05,250
Drones are everywhere.
We're gonna.

2823
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:07,200
We're gonna.
Let whistle blowers off the hook.

2824
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:09,810
Bullshit.
Cracks down on whistle blowers more than

2825
01:56:09,811 --> 01:56:13,200
anybody.
More military than George W Bush.

2826
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:17,130
Okay?
More more attacks on free press than any

2827
01:56:17,131 --> 01:56:19,830
Republican,
a republican president,

2828
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:22,890
but because he doesn't under the guise
of being on the left,

2829
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:27,030
people don't look at the cold hard
reality of his actions.

2830
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:29,070
Yeah,
so it's a bullshit fucking scam.

2831
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:33,060
So this guy comes along and he plays it
like a pro wrestler.

2832
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:38,210
He plays it like a reality TV star.
He plays it like a guy who is savvy

2833
01:56:38,371 --> 01:56:41,340
about the media.
He's been working the media his whole

2834
01:56:41,341 --> 01:56:43,470
career and it's working.

2835
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,451
Yeah.
No,

2836
01:56:44,451 --> 01:56:45,950
I love it.
And to your point,

2837
01:56:45,951 --> 01:56:50,250
he is running his presidential campaign
the way Vince Mcmahon would promote a

2838
01:56:50,251 --> 01:56:52,270
wrestle mania and he's getting
attention.

2839
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:54,380
He's evoking any emotion.
Front row.

2840
01:56:54,381 --> 01:56:56,260
Brian actually told me that.
Who's watching right now?

2841
01:56:56,261 --> 01:56:58,130
He keeps texting me so quick.
Shout out to him.

2842
01:56:58,131 --> 01:57:00,200
I'm stealing his line,
but he's right about that and he's

2843
01:57:00,201 --> 01:57:02,330
evoking emotion.
He's getting people involved.

2844
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:04,790
He understands that ratings are what get
you on TV.

2845
01:57:04,791 --> 01:57:06,380
He understands he can save money for
that.

2846
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:10,430
He's also refused to take donations.
He doesn't want to be.

2847
01:57:10,431 --> 01:57:13,240
Body wants everybody to understand that
he's going to go in free and clear and

2848
01:57:13,241 --> 01:57:14,110
oh,
nobody anything but,

2849
01:57:14,111 --> 01:57:15,020
but he wouldn't,
but wait a minute.

2850
01:57:15,021 --> 01:57:17,540
He just requested a bunch of donut.
He took it back,

2851
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:18,591
but he.
But Joe,

2852
01:57:18,591 --> 01:57:19,940
he was very candid about it.
He said,

2853
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,770
I have been funding this myself any
scent,

2854
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:24,500
and frankly I haven't gotten a very good
return.

2855
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:28,130
I'm funding this myself so everybody
knows I'm not button sold that I haven't

2856
01:57:28,131 --> 01:57:31,010
made deals that I'm going to go in there
and actually represent the paypal.

2857
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:32,870
I'm going to take a pay cut.
I'm going to go do a job.

2858
01:57:32,871 --> 01:57:35,180
I don't want to do it because it's a job
I think I need to do.

2859
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:38,060
That message didn't get out and he said,
look,

2860
01:57:38,061 --> 01:57:41,630
I'm losing in the polls to somebody who
is bought and paid for because she's got

2861
01:57:41,631 --> 01:57:44,030
more money than me.
You people don't seem to understand this

2862
01:57:44,031 --> 01:57:47,030
message of me going in there not owing
anybody anything.

2863
01:57:47,210 --> 01:57:50,690
I haven't got an investment on my return
and I'm thinking about taking it back

2864
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,700
and open it up today.
He,

2865
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:53,990
but he was very honest about it.
He was very candid.

2866
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,660
I thought he had like an emergency
drive.

2867
01:57:56,690 --> 01:57:58,640
He did and he just.
He pulled the back.

2868
01:57:58,940 --> 01:57:59,431
No,
no,

2869
01:57:59,431 --> 01:57:59,660
no,
no.

2870
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:01,730
What I'm saying.
You had the emergency drought,

2871
01:58:01,731 --> 01:58:03,020
but that was interesting too.
He said,

2872
01:58:03,021 --> 01:58:05,180
I want to raise $10,000,000 in two days,
and by the way,

2873
01:58:05,181 --> 01:58:07,580
if you guys give me 10,
I'll throw another tenant on myself.

2874
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,550
So he ended up matching.
He put 20 million and then he did it

2875
01:58:10,551 --> 01:58:11,450
again.
It was such a success.

2876
01:58:11,451 --> 01:58:12,284
He did it again.

2877
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:13,330
Well,
it's,

2878
01:58:13,330 --> 01:58:18,330
it's a weird situation for the Democrats
because if Hillary did get indicted and

2879
01:58:19,091 --> 01:58:21,580
if Hillary did wind up getting
convicted,

2880
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:24,490
are they punished her in any way?
It's over.

2881
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:25,960
That's hides over.
Right.

2882
01:58:26,290 --> 01:58:28,840
So who else is there?
Bernie Sanders.

2883
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:30,960
They don't want that,
right?

2884
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:34,480
Nobody wants that.
That's just crazy old socialists.

2885
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:39,480
A lot of a lot of people is Vermont.
She's picking up a Elizabeth Warren as

2886
01:58:39,481 --> 01:58:40,011
her running mate.
No,

2887
01:58:40,011 --> 01:58:42,130
I don't think so.
I think she's cognizant enough

2888
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,530
to know that America does not want to
look sexist,

2889
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:47,770
but it in fact is that America is going
to have a hard time putting a female as

2890
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:51,820
the commander and chief of the military
who doesn't come out and endorse

2891
01:58:51,821 --> 01:58:53,500
anybody,
but if you talk to them privately,

2892
01:58:53,501 --> 01:58:55,690
they do not want to be led by a woman.
That's a reality.

2893
01:58:56,350 --> 01:59:00,760
I think she's smart enough to know they
damn sure don't want to be led by two

2894
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:01,390
but there,
but.

2895
01:59:01,390 --> 01:59:02,950
But of course would never say that
publicly.

2896
01:59:02,951 --> 01:59:04,330
Right.
We don't want to look sexist as a

2897
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:08,500
country even though we are.
If Hillary wants to put the nail in the

2898
01:59:08,501 --> 01:59:10,540
coffin of this campaign,
she puts.

2899
01:59:10,541 --> 01:59:14,080
Bill is our VP.
She does not have an ego that would

2900
01:59:14,081 --> 01:59:18,150
allow her to do such and I think she
might make the air of putting Elizabeth

2901
01:59:18,170 --> 01:59:19,870
warning.
Man,

2902
01:59:19,871 --> 01:59:23,380
that would be a weird thing because
Elizabeth Warren pretended that she was

2903
01:59:23,381 --> 01:59:24,610
native American.
Yeah.

2904
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:27,070
She lied.
Straight up lie and that's racist.

2905
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:29,470
No way around that whole cultural
appropriation.

2906
01:59:29,471 --> 01:59:31,750
That's a big thing today.
There's no way around that one.

2907
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,150
She should've did and then what she
commented on her.

2908
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:35,380
Well,
my eyes look this way.

2909
01:59:35,381 --> 01:59:35,771
She,
yeah,

2910
01:59:35,771 --> 01:59:38,880
it got bad.
It got bad and trump instead of just.

2911
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,170
Instead of saying it the way you use it,
well you know you lied about me.

2912
01:59:41,230 --> 01:59:43,570
He called her pocahontas,
Pocahontas.

2913
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:46,630
Everybody says that's.
He says it more will.

2914
01:59:46,631 --> 01:59:50,210
He calls Bernie Sanders crazy.
Bernie called Hillary Lion.

2915
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:51,190
Hillary.
Crooked,

2916
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:52,750
crooked,
Crooked Hillary.

2917
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:53,830
That's smart.
I mean,

2918
01:59:53,831 --> 01:59:57,330
look what he does by labeling them and
then a white lion.

2919
01:59:57,340 --> 01:59:59,170
Ted.
That's great.

2920
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:00,950
It's wrestling me.
He gave me the ball.

2921
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:02,620
He didn't.
He gave them all a gimmick.

2922
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:03,850
Well,
he juked the system.

2923
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,240
The system was based on deception the
first place and they had this whole

2924
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:11,230
standard operation.
The way they would run things,

2925
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:15,840
they would all do it the exact same way
and he came in and exposed all the flaws

2926
02:00:15,841 --> 02:00:17,200
in the game.
Yeah.

2927
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:20,350
And he's not done and he's not backing
off and everybody keeps waiting in the

2928
02:00:20,351 --> 02:00:24,580
backyard it because it's not the real
presidential candidate.

2929
02:00:24,610 --> 02:00:26,560
I mean,
it's not the real campaign yet.

2930
02:00:26,561 --> 02:00:31,120
The real campaign begins once.
It is absolutely hillary and absolutely

2931
02:00:31,121 --> 02:00:34,870
him and it gets boiled down,
like right now we're in July when it

2932
02:00:34,871 --> 02:00:38,950
gets to be August and then September,
that's when Shit's gonna really start

2933
02:00:38,951 --> 02:00:43,540
flying and you know it's going to be
interesting to see what he uses to try

2934
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:48,190
to attack her and what she used to try
to attack him and how both there they're

2935
02:00:48,191 --> 02:00:52,090
both going to get damaged in the process
and our system is going to be damaged in

2936
02:00:52,091 --> 02:00:55,780
the process and that's something that I
think everybody is kind of cognizant of

2937
02:00:55,781 --> 02:00:59,500
when you destroy someone who is on their
way to become the commander and chief,

2938
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:03,410
you kind of weak in the whole nation
because that person becomes the like,

2939
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:05,740
look,
if Hillary won,

2940
02:01:05,910 --> 02:01:09,040
say if the elections were tomorrow and
the FBI thing happened today and then

2941
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:10,710
she winds tomorrow and everybody's going
to be like,

2942
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:13,780
Ooh,
we know she did something that we would

2943
02:01:13,781 --> 02:01:14,620
have been punished for.

2944
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:18,700
How is this weakens the position and it
weakens it in the eyes of the world too.

2945
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:19,400
I'm sure

2946
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:20,450
it does.
It does.

2947
02:01:20,451 --> 02:01:23,420
When we talk about vp picks,
I'm not sure that they've got to write.

2948
02:01:23,421 --> 02:01:26,390
The media thinks they've got it narrowed
down to four guys and they added one

2949
02:01:26,391 --> 02:01:29,910
more for trump on trump's side.
Christy and Gingrich and pence and

2950
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:32,060
they've.
They've got five and I don't think

2951
02:01:32,061 --> 02:01:34,490
they're right.
I think that he will go outside the box.

2952
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:38,270
He's not going to put a woman in there
just just to put a vagina on the ticket

2953
02:01:38,271 --> 02:01:40,010
and think he's going to do like mccain
did with

2954
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:42,380
Pailin.
I think he's going to bring in somebody

2955
02:01:42,381 --> 02:01:45,440
that's either got admiral or colonel or
general next to their name.

2956
02:01:45,441 --> 02:01:50,441
I think that it is very important for
him to look powerful and be powerful and

2957
02:01:50,541 --> 02:01:53,360
I think he wants a military guy and I
think that's who he admires.

2958
02:01:53,361 --> 02:01:56,720
I don't think he admires politicians.
I think he admires soldiers.

2959
02:01:56,840 --> 02:02:00,620
That would be interesting if he did that
and that would be a huge step up if he

2960
02:02:00,621 --> 02:02:04,670
did do that and in in,
in terms of like how public responded to

2961
02:02:04,671 --> 02:02:06,650
him because if he's like the big
showman,

2962
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:11,150
but he's got some very serious guy with
some real world experience as his second

2963
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:13,130
guy,
that would be a really interesting.

2964
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:16,010
It's just to me,
it's just disturbing that we're down to

2965
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:19,990
a reality TV star and an old lady trying
to get back at her husband for a blow

2966
02:02:19,991 --> 02:02:21,610
job.
He got in the nineties show.

2967
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:22,483
The whole thing is

2968
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:26,010
disturbing Bill Clinton tree to the
White House like it was a frat and I

2969
02:02:26,011 --> 02:02:28,470
will forever appreciate that.
I just will.

2970
02:02:28,590 --> 02:02:29,490
I just.
Well,

2971
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,730
I mean he was a mess.
He was all these different.

2972
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:34,190
He was unapologetic.
He was the master liar member.

2973
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:37,530
The divisible in the not denominator and
he was going in all these circles and

2974
02:02:37,531 --> 02:02:39,390
before you're done,
you just flat out confused,

2975
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:41,700
man.
That Oxford degree really sent me in

2976
02:02:41,701 --> 02:02:43,290
circles.
I guess we give this guy a pass.

2977
02:02:43,291 --> 02:02:44,610
He's an odd dude,
man.

2978
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:48,180
He's a very odd dude and he still swing
and he's still swinging out there for

2979
02:02:48,181 --> 02:02:49,440
his wife.
Yeah.

2980
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:51,220
And See,
that's another one though,

2981
02:02:51,221 --> 02:02:52,100
Joe,
if you don't mind me interrupting,

2982
02:02:52,110 --> 02:02:54,210
if he would've just told the truth back
then,

2983
02:02:54,211 --> 02:02:56,430
just use the truth on a site.
It would have all been done if he

2984
02:02:56,431 --> 02:02:57,181
would've just said,
man,

2985
02:02:57,181 --> 02:02:59,280
I'll sleep with anything in the world
except her.

2986
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:03,540
If he would've just done that,
it'd be all over and said he started

2987
02:03:03,541 --> 02:03:05,520
getting crazy.
If he would've hit them with that line.

2988
02:03:05,521 --> 02:03:06,450
You know,
it's the same thing.

2989
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:07,920
It's the same thing with,
uh,

2990
02:03:07,950 --> 02:03:09,630
with trump right now.
If he would have just said,

2991
02:03:09,631 --> 02:03:11,250
look,
I think that America should have a long

2992
02:03:11,251 --> 02:03:13,020
leash,
but attached to that Leisha is a big old

2993
02:03:13,021 --> 02:03:15,990
bomb and this is how we're going to do
it and we'll light the thing if we have

2994
02:03:15,991 --> 02:03:18,240
to.
It's hard to deal with.

2995
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:20,100
It's really hard to deal with.
I got all of this,

2996
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:24,090
this philosophy from you giving me your
take on how Michael Richards should have

2997
02:03:24,091 --> 02:03:26,700
handed the comedy store.
When you said he should've come out,

2998
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,020
he should have said,
here's my problems.

2999
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:29,430
I'm not a funny comic.
Okay.

3000
02:03:29,431 --> 02:03:31,830
I was self conscious.
You guys made me feel bad.

3001
02:03:31,831 --> 02:03:33,720
I wanted to hurt your feelings.
Had nothing to do with race.

3002
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:36,510
I tried to hurt your feelings and you're
right.

3003
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:37,980
It all would have gone away because we
go,

3004
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:38,540
yeah,
that,

3005
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:39,730
that is what happened.
You know,

3006
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:40,670
it is what happened.

3007
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:42,710
But,
and that's precisely with Charlie Sheen

3008
02:03:42,711 --> 02:03:45,260
did when Charlie Sheen came out and he
said,

3009
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:46,550
look,
this is how I roll.

3010
02:03:46,551 --> 02:03:49,730
I smoke rocks,
I pay girls to leave.

3011
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:52,190
I don't pay him to have sex.
And everyone was like,

3012
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:53,670
what the fuck?
What,

3013
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,580
what do you say to that?
You can't say anything.

3014
02:03:55,581 --> 02:03:58,520
And everybody was Hashtag Tiger blood.
It was all over the.

3015
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:02,000
I mean he became sort of until the HIV
thing came that kind of put an

3016
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:02,840
accountant

3017
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,460
that put a damper,
but you're right.

3018
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:07,790
Sheen was the original Shin was the
originalist sat in the hot speed.

3019
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:11,540
Everybody was waiting for the tearful
Jon Jones style apology and it did not

3020
02:04:11,541 --> 02:04:14,140
come.
She huge because it ended up doing a

3021
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:16,980
comedy or a an appearance tour,
whatever he saw.

3022
02:04:16,981 --> 02:04:21,260
He did seven and a half million dollars
in tickets on a two week tour because of

3023
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:23,690
that one sit down where he refused to
apologize.

3024
02:04:23,691 --> 02:04:24,790
Why I like to party.

3025
02:04:24,970 --> 02:04:27,280
I didn't even have any comedy.
He didn't know what to do,

3026
02:04:27,281 --> 02:04:30,850
so he went to these things coked up
thinking he was just going to power

3027
02:04:30,851 --> 02:04:34,510
through it with charisma and people were
bu in and people and he's like,

3028
02:04:34,511 --> 02:04:35,470
Hey,
I got your money.

3029
02:04:35,471 --> 02:04:38,280
I already got your money,
which is fucking crazy

3030
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,230
to yell out of people that have bought
your tickets.

3031
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:42,900
But then he adjusted.
He got smart and you brought guys like

3032
02:04:42,901 --> 02:04:46,560
Russell Peters in to sit down with them
and interview him and they actually

3033
02:04:46,561 --> 02:04:49,890
worked out a routine and it actually
became an entertaining show towards the

3034
02:04:49,891 --> 02:04:54,510
last leg of the tour.
But his ability to step up and say,

3035
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,130
hey,
I like coke.

3036
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,800
I like to smoke coke.
I get together.

3037
02:04:58,801 --> 02:05:00,660
I get a bunch of girls.
I pay him money.

3038
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:03,000
I fucked up and then they leave and
everybody's like,

3039
02:05:03,001 --> 02:05:05,250
well,
because that's what everybody's always

3040
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:10,340
avoided to catch someone always doing
trucks like prostitute.

3041
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:12,750
The cover up is always worse than the
crime.

3042
02:05:12,751 --> 02:05:14,100
Again,
you go back to John Jones,

3043
02:05:14,370 --> 02:05:16,020
John Jones gets tagged in that coke
thing.

3044
02:05:16,021 --> 02:05:20,290
He pops on Fox and the and the woman
asks him why he did it and that was Sam

3045
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:20,531
Johnson.
Well,

3046
02:05:20,531 --> 02:05:21,181
you know,
but any,

3047
02:05:21,181 --> 02:05:22,440
any try to dance around.

3048
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:26,160
He had his pocket of.
I did it to get high.

3049
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,600
Next question.
Stupid.

3050
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:29,130
Yeah.
That's it.

3051
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:29,701
So,
yeah,

3052
02:05:29,701 --> 02:05:31,770
it was funny.
I was at a party having a good time.

3053
02:05:31,771 --> 02:05:33,630
I didn't know you're going to test me,
right?

3054
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:36,870
That's the answer.
But use the truth on your side is just,

3055
02:05:36,871 --> 02:05:39,540
it just shuts everybody down and it's,
it's endearing and refreshing.

3056
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:40,680
Well,
this,

3057
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:42,630
this current thing that he's on right
now,

3058
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:45,300
um,
I wonder if he can do that with this.

3059
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:47,700
I mean,
I wonder if he knows what it was that he

3060
02:05:47,701 --> 02:05:48,491
took.
You know,

3061
02:05:48,491 --> 02:05:49,470
I mean,
I just don't know.

3062
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:50,980
I know I'm,
I'm really,

3063
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:54,750
I'm confused by this one because I don't
know how many different options there

3064
02:05:54,751 --> 02:05:58,020
could have been where these are the two
things that he tested positive for.

3065
02:05:58,110 --> 02:06:01,350
I don't know how many options there
could have been other than him taking

3066
02:06:01,351 --> 02:06:03,120
that because he was getting off
steroids,

3067
02:06:03,121 --> 02:06:07,530
but that doesn't even seem to make sense
because he had been tested like much

3068
02:06:07,531 --> 02:06:11,790
more recently or before that,
like we're close to that and he didn't

3069
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:14,310
have that in his system and he didn't
have steroids in a system.

3070
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:18,810
But to victor context credit,
Victor Conte did question.

3071
02:06:18,811 --> 02:06:23,811
Jon Jones is a testosterone levels and
EPA testosterone levels before carbon

3072
02:06:25,471 --> 02:06:26,640
isotope tents.
Yes.

3073
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:28,970
Yeah,
and they were for Gazy.

3074
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:34,440
What could cause that at various same.
All you're going to do is confuse people

3075
02:06:34,441 --> 02:06:37,200
when you start talking about that,
and frankly you can't get doctors to

3076
02:06:37,201 --> 02:06:38,580
totally agree.
Even with Sada,

3077
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,230
with their highest scientists and
everything there.

3078
02:06:40,231 --> 02:06:41,670
There's some confusion there.

3079
02:06:42,030 --> 02:06:44,580
There was something for gazy going on,
but it wasn't enough.

3080
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:47,620
It was just enough to start rumors not
to actually take him in and,

3081
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:49,470
and go against him.
But you know,

3082
02:06:49,471 --> 02:06:51,900
you glossed over what I opened the show
with and I thought it was going to be

3083
02:06:51,901 --> 02:06:53,550
one of the high points of the whole
podcast.

3084
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:55,160
I didn't know if you had to do it.
No,

3085
02:06:55,161 --> 02:06:56,750
not the cop.
I don't know if you had this,

3086
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:00,180
so I don't mean to go back to it,
but the point that this test that we're

3087
02:07:00,181 --> 02:07:02,790
all talking about is June 16th and there
could.

3088
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:04,950
There's got to be another shoe that's
getting ready to drop now.

3089
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:06,870
Whether that comes back hot or what it
comes back clean,

3090
02:07:06,871 --> 02:07:09,110
we don't know,
but there is no way that Assad sought

3091
02:07:09,180 --> 02:07:13,240
last time testing a guy for a fight that
was supposed to take place this last

3092
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:14,071
Saturday.
It was June 60.

3093
02:07:14,071 --> 02:07:17,340
There's just no way.
They've got to be at least another test

3094
02:07:17,341 --> 02:07:21,770
out there and possibly to brock lesnar.
They test him every other day for stuff

3095
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,380
five

3096
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:25,140
times within the first two weeks.
That was in the first two weeks.

3097
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,180
Eight times.
Same thing.

3098
02:07:27,181 --> 02:07:29,520
They did the same thing to her.
They tested her a ton of times.

3099
02:07:30,270 --> 02:07:31,260
Yeah.
I don't know.

3100
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:33,750
I mean we.
This is just speculation,

3101
02:07:33,751 --> 02:07:35,680
right?
We really won't know and I'm sure we'll

3102
02:07:35,681 --> 02:07:36,070
find

3103
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:40,420
out shortly because those tests take a
while to get the results back because

3104
02:07:40,421 --> 02:07:43,090
they're very,
very thorough and if he tested June

3105
02:07:43,091 --> 02:07:44,890
16th,
you've got to assume big,

3106
02:07:44,891 --> 02:07:46,780
high profile,
UFC 200.

3107
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:49,660
And the guy was already tested positive
for some time before.

3108
02:07:49,661 --> 02:07:51,610
So they're gonna.
They're gonna be sneaking around trying

3109
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:54,280
to catch him.
What was the crazy story where he went?

3110
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:56,800
He was hiding.
Is that true?

3111
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:58,810
I wasn't there.
I'll tell the story.

3112
02:07:58,830 --> 02:07:59,710
All right,
let's tell the story.

3113
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:03,310
Assata came in and it gives us,
by the way,

3114
02:08:03,311 --> 02:08:04,610
this is a legend.
It is,

3115
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:05,473
yeah.

3116
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:06,680
Story.
The story.

3117
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,980
But uh,
this from some,

3118
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:11,540
some of those teammates,
UFC fighters that claimed they were

3119
02:08:11,541 --> 02:08:12,860
there,
but that.

3120
02:08:12,980 --> 02:08:15,650
And that doesn't make it true.
Myfi guys tired of him beating the fuck

3121
02:08:15,651 --> 02:08:18,890
out of them.
All the disclaimers aside.

3122
02:08:18,891 --> 02:08:20,410
Let's get down to the entertainment side
of this.

3123
02:08:20,411 --> 02:08:25,411
So solder rolls in to Jackson's gym to
do a test on John Jones and there was

3124
02:08:25,641 --> 02:08:27,470
only some coaches in there.
And John,

3125
02:08:27,471 --> 02:08:31,220
if there was like five people there at
the time so he can see them coming.

3126
02:08:31,260 --> 02:08:33,830
They where they parked,
he can see them coming so they don't

3127
02:08:33,831 --> 02:08:36,350
know what to do with them.
They hide them underneath the cage.

3128
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,390
They hired John John tides up to the
cage.

3129
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:43,610
They tell John we don't know where he is
and this is before we were enrolled in

3130
02:08:43,611 --> 02:08:46,340
the program and he did not need to
disclose his whereabouts.

3131
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:49,190
At the same time,
if they show up and find you,

3132
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:52,040
you must tap vandelay this situation,
you must test.

3133
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:54,360
They can't find you.
You didn't have to test back this.

3134
02:08:54,361 --> 02:08:56,510
So anyway you hides under the ring.
They said,

3135
02:08:56,511 --> 02:08:57,770
well where is he supposed to?
You know,

3136
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:59,120
this is Jim.
They said,

3137
02:08:59,130 --> 02:09:02,690
well how would I know where he is?
So instead of leaving like they thought

3138
02:09:02,691 --> 02:09:04,010
they would,
do they take a seat?

3139
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:06,980
Well there's like eight hours left in
the business day.

3140
02:09:06,981 --> 02:09:08,330
They don't ever leave.
However,

3141
02:09:08,331 --> 02:09:12,470
along with six to eight hour timeframe,
John's under the cage the entire time.

3142
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:14,630
So people are coming and going the whole
thing.

3143
02:09:14,631 --> 02:09:17,330
And finally they shut the lights off and
go to lock the doors.

3144
02:09:17,331 --> 02:09:20,870
Now John can come out.
What we found out about that and they

3145
02:09:20,871 --> 02:09:21,860
want it.
They didn't do this.

3146
02:09:21,861 --> 02:09:26,861
They wanted to get a warrant and go
under that ring under the theory that at

3147
02:09:27,261 --> 02:09:29,300
some point in that six to eight hour
span,

3148
02:09:29,301 --> 02:09:33,110
he would've had a pee where they wanted
to go under forensically and collect

3149
02:09:33,111 --> 02:09:33,560
that urine.

3150
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:36,380
That's how upset they were that they had
been had.

3151
02:09:36,770 --> 02:09:40,550
Now I realize that we're saying all the
nice to have a that happened.

3152
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:42,870
How long was the timeframe and all of
that,

3153
02:09:42,871 --> 02:09:43,704
that,
that part.

3154
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:47,030
That part's coming after him.
After that,

3155
02:09:47,031 --> 02:09:49,490
when they found out that they had been
to anything they hate,

3156
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:52,190
they don't like when people say their
test doesn't work and they don't like

3157
02:09:52,191 --> 02:09:55,930
being duped and they came after.
I remember when I predicted rumbled,

3158
02:09:55,931 --> 02:09:57,910
Jones will not happen.
Yes you did.

3159
02:09:57,950 --> 02:10:01,520
That's because I had that story and I
knew soda was looking for him.

3160
02:10:01,521 --> 02:10:05,540
I knew they had boots on the ground in
albuquerque waiting for him to lead the

3161
02:10:05,541 --> 02:10:07,880
club late and for it to get him for
anything.

3162
02:10:07,881 --> 02:10:09,680
I was armed with that.
I've never told that.

3163
02:10:09,681 --> 02:10:11,570
So that's why I predict that fight.
What had happened,

3164
02:10:11,571 --> 02:10:15,440
I knew they were after him and this is
before we had to do the whereabouts like

3165
02:10:15,441 --> 02:10:17,990
we do now.
Back then it was just random and they

3166
02:10:17,991 --> 02:10:19,370
had people,
they were just waiting.

3167
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:21,650
They were just waiting for the right
time and they were going to grab him.

3168
02:10:22,030 --> 02:10:24,830
Wow.
To get a.

3169
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:28,090
If they got a warrant to check
underneath the well,

3170
02:10:28,091 --> 02:10:29,390
how would they prove that it was his
pee?

3171
02:10:29,550 --> 02:10:32,330
That's a lot of fighters or dirty.
There's a lot of problems,

3172
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:33,850
you know,
just in just

3173
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:35,720
like,
just to show support.

3174
02:10:35,721 --> 02:10:37,880
They could all just whip their dicks out
and pea underneath the cage.

3175
02:10:37,881 --> 02:10:38,690
Yeah,
sure.

3176
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:42,290
I mean if you really love the guy,
pollute the water better yet,

3177
02:10:42,291 --> 02:10:44,060
Joe,
you go under and you clean underneath

3178
02:10:44,061 --> 02:10:45,920
the cage.
That would also solve the problem,

3179
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:48,050
but it turns out John's pregnant.
Look right,

3180
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:52,370
get under there and yeah,
it was just a mess,

3181
02:10:52,371 --> 02:10:53,270
but yeah,
that's,

3182
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:55,280
that's could be anybody's urine.
There you go.

3183
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:56,451
Yeah.
Yeah.

3184
02:10:56,451 --> 02:10:57,111
It wasn't.
I mean,

3185
02:10:57,111 --> 02:11:00,170
that's a great story though.
It's one of the great all time of

3186
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:02,090
avoiding a drug test story.
Sure.

3187
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:03,860
Maybe the best,
right?

3188
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,053
Yeah.
Um,

3189
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:08,140
you came out here to promote a
submission grappling thing to it.

3190
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:10,580
Yeah.
We got a big thing coming up a Sunday

02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:16,910
That's,
that's the trick.

3195
02:11:16,911 --> 02:11:18,620

02:11:26,261 --> 02:11:28,430
low combat.
Thank you for correcting me on that.

3201
02:11:28,990 --> 02:11:30,560
Ebi Rules,
Eddie Bravo.

3202
02:11:30,561 --> 02:11:32,510
Invitational rules that they'll go for
eight minutes.

3203
02:11:32,511 --> 02:11:35,000
There's no score.
You either find a submission or you

3204
02:11:35,001 --> 02:11:36,230
don't.
If you don't,

3205
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:40,130
you go into an overtime format.
Now you know how Ebi Works and this is

3206
02:11:40,131 --> 02:11:41,720
the biggest promotion of the whole
thing,

3207
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:44,480
isn't that somebody is going to go out
and compete and I got to do some

3208
02:11:44,481 --> 02:11:46,640
grappling since I've been retired,
but we all,

3209
02:11:46,641 --> 02:11:48,800
we always had a clause that if you could
eat up the clock,

3210
02:11:48,801 --> 02:11:50,270
you've got to draw.
Nobody loses.

3211
02:11:50,271 --> 02:11:52,880
Whether that's a victory.
Sometimes when you're in over your head,

3212
02:11:52,881 --> 02:11:56,660
you're up there wrestling for a draw.
When I had a vow that was out there

3213
02:11:56,661 --> 02:11:59,600
wrestling for a draw under Ebi rules,
somebody is going to tap.

3214
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:02,160
So when you factor in,
you've got jake shields taken on.

3215
02:12:02,161 --> 02:12:05,210
Chris Lidell,
one of those guys is going to tap when

3216
02:12:05,211 --> 02:12:08,360
you've got vinny Mongolians,
maybe the best grappler there is right

3217
02:12:08,370 --> 02:12:09,330
now.
Mega lays.

3218
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:12,830
He always corrects me on that too.
I feel like it's tomato,

3219
02:12:12,831 --> 02:12:15,580
tomato,
vinny Mokuleia.

3220
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:18,520
And so I said,
uh,

3221
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:20,540
you know he's going to be taken on.
Ronnie marks.

3222
02:12:20,570 --> 02:12:22,250
King Mo got hurt.
He hurt his neck.

3223
02:12:22,251 --> 02:12:24,260
Ronnie marks has now stepped in.
He fought.

3224
02:12:24,261 --> 02:12:26,050
You were here?
Yeah.

3225
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:27,800
Chemo hurt his neck.
King Modena pulled out.

3226
02:12:27,801 --> 02:12:29,900
I pulled him off the card.
I found out he was hurt,

3227
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:33,530
it happened in,
in his fight with Phil Davis and he's,

3228
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:36,830
he's one of the main training partners
for Robbie lawler and he hasn't even

3229
02:12:36,831 --> 02:12:39,470
been able to train with Robbie.
I ran into Labario.

3230
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:40,910
Uh,
you want to correct me on that name for

3231
02:12:40,911 --> 02:12:41,150
you?

3232
02:12:41,150 --> 02:12:44,360
Thank you.
Ran into Laborio over the weekend at

3233
02:12:44,361 --> 02:12:45,560
the,
at the super show.

3234
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:47,750
And uh,
he said,

3235
02:12:47,751 --> 02:12:48,200
man,
King,

3236
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:49,031
King,
Mo King,

3237
02:12:49,031 --> 02:12:50,390
Mo can't move.
He just doesn't.

3238
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:52,160
He doesn't want to pull out herniated
disc.

3239
02:12:52,161 --> 02:12:53,240
Yeah.
Something like that.

3240
02:12:53,241 --> 02:12:55,040
I don't have all the details,
but I got to hold them all.

3241
02:12:55,041 --> 02:12:55,791
I said,
is this true?

3242
02:12:55,791 --> 02:12:56,624
He said,
yeah,

3243
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:00,230
I'm going to come to so many guys a
fucked up next.

3244
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:01,400
Yeah,
we got to pull that one.

3245
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:03,000
Sohani marks is in.
He fought you.

3246
02:13:03,001 --> 02:13:04,040
El Ramiro.
Erin Simpson.

3247
02:13:04,041 --> 02:13:06,290
Do you remember those?
He just signed with world series of

3248
02:13:06,291 --> 02:13:09,650
fighting a Sohani Zen against vinny.
And then the biggest one,

3249
02:13:09,651 --> 02:13:12,500
the absolute biggest one that wasn't
meant to be,

3250
02:13:12,501 --> 02:13:14,360
but this is the one that's got my phone
ringing.

3251
02:13:14,490 --> 02:13:17,570
Rico Rodrigues is coming back after all
these years.

3252
02:13:17,571 --> 02:13:18,930
He's going to take on [inaudible] or
sharing,

3253
02:13:18,931 --> 02:13:21,170
or my coach,
he's going to take on my coach and one

3254
02:13:21,171 --> 02:13:22,630
of them is going to tap into.

3255
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:25,580
They will not leave until someone tells
slot in the UFC back in the day.

3256
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:29,240
He's a excellent Brazilian Jujitsu
practitioner.

3257
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:30,051
Yeah,
that's interesting.

3258
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:31,470
Matter.
Rico is a bad motherfucker,

3259
02:13:31,471 --> 02:13:32,760
man.
His ground game is very good.

3260
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:34,170
He's fantastic.
He's fantastic.

3261
02:13:34,171 --> 02:13:36,270
And then the question with Rico,
Joe,

3262
02:13:36,290 --> 02:13:39,930
you know,
grappling is a gateway into mma.

3263
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:42,030
So now that Rico's all of a sudden back
in grappling,

3264
02:13:42,031 --> 02:13:45,330
that's everybody's big question,
is he coming back to mma and he's one of

3265
02:13:45,331 --> 02:13:47,910
those guys that left the sport on his
own.

3266
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:50,760
There wasn't that a promoter when it
sign them or Dana didn't want them or

3267
02:13:50,761 --> 02:13:53,310
pride wouldn't put them under contract.
He had those personal right.

3268
02:13:53,311 --> 02:13:55,250
He did whatever,
but he left on his own.

3269
02:13:55,251 --> 02:13:57,450
It's kind of the way Sean Sherk left.
Sean's just one day.

3270
02:13:57,451 --> 02:13:59,520
It wasn't fighting anymore,
but it took like two years until the

3271
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:03,630
announcement came.
It just makes me wonder is Ricoh coming

3272
02:14:03,631 --> 02:14:03,870
back?

3273
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:05,520
And I think that that's pretty cool.
If he is.

3274
02:14:05,521 --> 02:14:09,300
It's very rare where a world champion
returns that speculation,

3275
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:10,590
but let's see what happens.
Well,

3276
02:14:10,591 --> 02:14:13,410
it's an interesting matchup either way
and so this is something you're doing

3277
02:14:13,411 --> 02:14:16,710
for the first time on flow combat and
you said that they have to become a

3278
02:14:16,711 --> 02:14:17,850
member,
like what does that entail?

3279
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,260
Giving up your email address or
something?

3280
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:19,921
Yeah,
you go over,

3281
02:14:19,921 --> 02:14:23,220
you register a flow combat.com.
I think it's like 15 bucks a month.

3282
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:25,590
14 95.
It's a network though.

3283
02:14:25,591 --> 02:14:27,160
It's kind of like fight pass.
There's.

3284
02:14:27,161 --> 02:14:29,280
There's content,
there's behind the scenes.

3285
02:14:29,281 --> 02:14:31,710
It's a whole network,
so you're not going to buy a paper view

3286
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:34,680
window that then shuts off.
You become a member and then you can

3287
02:14:34,681 --> 02:14:36,960
turn that off the next day.
You can turn it off at the end of the

3288
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:37,950
month.
You're going to buy for the month,

3289
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:39,870
so you get an entire package.

3290
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:42,240
They've got a ton of members.
He's a real successful guys,

3291
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:47,040
so it's Kinda just to satisfy them.
The show soul that's completely sold out

3292
02:14:47,041 --> 02:14:47,741
in Portland.
It.

3293
02:14:47,741 --> 02:14:48,900
It'll be,
in my mind,

3294
02:14:48,901 --> 02:14:51,150
the biggest grappling of whenever I've
done metamorris.

3295
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:53,610
Metamorris was sold out,
but they had 700 tickets.

3296
02:14:53,611 --> 02:14:57,240
This is a lot more tickets sold out.
The only way to watch will be on flow

3297
02:14:57,241 --> 02:14:59,340
combat.com.
So the guys that are participating are

3298
02:14:59,341 --> 02:15:01,050
going to have a lot of fun.
I did some grappling.

3299
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:03,600
I just took out Michael Bisping in a,
in a grappling match.

3300
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:08,340
Roy Jones was on the car.
It was this crazy car to uh,

3301
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:12,060
we wrestled in Arizona like the week
after he beat Anderson.

3302
02:15:12,061 --> 02:15:14,300
This just happened really?
But nobody came.

3303
02:15:14,301 --> 02:15:15,001
So people were like,
you,

3304
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:16,590
they didn't even know what was going on.
Oh,

3305
02:15:16,591 --> 02:15:19,710
I had heard about Roy Jones boxing some
fan,

3306
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:22,260
but fought a fan that goes five and
three and mma,

3307
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:24,930
a two window,
an amateur boxing.

3308
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:26,670
And he gave Roy a match.
He get Roy met.

3309
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:28,380
Roy figured about bumble,
shut them off.

3310
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:30,270
Well,
this is a boy had been knocked out

3311
02:15:30,271 --> 02:15:33,450
brutally just a couple of months ago I
think in Russia or Germany.

3312
02:15:33,460 --> 02:15:34,230
And fight was.
Yeah,

3313
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:35,430
that was,
I was awful.

3314
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:36,960
Yeah.
Roy is staying busy though.

3315
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:39,840
You know,
I just hate to see them take punishment

3316
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:42,960
because he was such a great fighter.
So good.

3317
02:15:42,961 --> 02:15:44,970
It's just,
it's so sad to see him now.

3318
02:15:45,210 --> 02:15:47,940
His body just looks doughy.
He doesn't look good.

3319
02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:49,860
You know,
he's still an excellent commentator

3320
02:15:49,861 --> 02:15:50,311
though.
I mean,

3321
02:15:50,311 --> 02:15:52,170
it's not.
It's not effecting the wheat talks.

3322
02:15:52,230 --> 02:15:53,220
Right?
That is true.

3323
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:54,670
Yeah.
It was good to see Roy.

3324
02:15:54,710 --> 02:15:55,511
But the point was,
you know,

3325
02:15:55,511 --> 02:15:57,030
that you had a limited amount of people
there.

3326
02:15:57,090 --> 02:16:00,900
So in grappling events and then
metamorris now,

3327
02:16:00,901 --> 02:16:02,820
or at least for the last one,
they've got a show coming up too,

3328
02:16:02,821 --> 02:16:05,460
but the last one they had,
we wrestle in front of nobody.

3329
02:16:05,970 --> 02:16:08,880
I was kind of ended that.
But the point is you grapplers like

3330
02:16:08,881 --> 02:16:11,100
people there.
I just kinda like that opposite field

3331
02:16:11,101 --> 02:16:13,020
from going into a packed arena to that
field.

3332
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:17,220
Get more of a practice room atmosphere
at any rate with Kuma Tay,

3333
02:16:17,370 --> 02:16:19,290
now that you're correcting all my words,
is that what I'm trying to say?

3334
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:22,140
This one sold out.
So the grapplers are going to wrestle.

3335
02:16:22,141 --> 02:16:24,360
They're going to have a roaring audience
and it's a rare thing.

3336
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:25,980
Well,
the Eddie Bravo rules,

3337
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:28,980
Eddie Bravo invitation rules are without
a doubt the best rules because they

3338
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:30,010
force guys in a bad

3339
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:34,150
situation.
So what it is is after the fight goes to

3340
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:37,150
the would you have eight minutes,
eight minutes after it goes through the

3341
02:16:37,151 --> 02:16:40,120
eight minute timed difference in there's
a draw.

3342
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:42,580
What happens is you put guys in bad
positions,

3343
02:16:42,581 --> 02:16:45,610
so just like in wrestling,
one guy will start on the bottom in

3344
02:16:45,611 --> 02:16:47,590
Jujitsu,
what they're doing with Eddie Bravo

3345
02:16:47,591 --> 02:16:51,490
rules is one guy will start on your back
or he'll start in a position called

3346
02:16:51,491 --> 02:16:53,840
spiderweb,
which means you're defending.

3347
02:16:53,841 --> 02:16:55,960
You got the guy in the bottoms defending
against an art bar.

3348
02:16:56,110 --> 02:17:00,130
The guy on the top is inside control
with the arm hooked and controlling the

3349
02:17:00,131 --> 02:17:02,620
leg.
So it's a bad spot to be in if you're on

3350
02:17:02,621 --> 02:17:05,860
the bottom and it's a bad spot.
If a guy obviously has your back.

3351
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:10,510
So by putting guys in those situations,
you will allow the fight or to try to

3352
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:13,450
work from a really bad spot to try to
get a tap.

3353
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:18,190
And then you switched places.
So if you started on my back and you tap

3354
02:17:18,191 --> 02:17:20,650
me,
then I have at least an opportunity to

3355
02:17:20,651 --> 02:17:23,680
try to tap you and if you escaped and
you wind up winning the whole thing,

3356
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:25,930
but it could be that you escape,
escape,

3357
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:27,003
escape,
escape,

3358
02:17:27,160 --> 02:17:31,300
and we see a lot of those matches where
it's like down to the wire and if that's

3359
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:35,800
the case then he count up the amount of
time spent in control.

3360
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:40,690
So if it takes you 10 seconds to escape,
but it takes me 30 seconds to escape,

3361
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:42,400
you would win because you escaped
quicker,

3362
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:43,720
right?
That's exactly right.

3363
02:17:43,721 --> 02:17:46,780
It's a great way to figure out how to
make grappling matches.

3364
02:17:46,781 --> 02:17:47,160
Excited.

3365
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,410
I talked to Eddie before we went into
this and I said,

3366
02:17:49,411 --> 02:17:50,244
hey listen,
we're doing.

3367
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:51,121
What are you doing?
We're getting.

3368
02:17:51,121 --> 02:17:52,920
We can fall in the same day.
It's how do you want to do this?

3369
02:17:52,921 --> 02:17:54,360
You know,
let's not get a battle with each other.

3370
02:17:54,361 --> 02:17:54,661
He goes,
no,

3371
02:17:54,661 --> 02:17:54,900
no,
no.

3372
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:55,860
Just the opposite.
He said,

3373
02:17:55,861 --> 02:17:57,270
I want these guys to have somewhere to
wrestle.

3374
02:17:57,271 --> 02:17:58,260
He said,
but she'll do this.

3375
02:17:58,530 --> 02:18:00,210
Take my rules,
call it Abi.

3376
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,200
That puts me up,
but he goes,

3377
02:18:01,201 --> 02:18:03,510
but do it,
and he had a great point,

3378
02:18:03,511 --> 02:18:04,470
Joel,
here's what his point was.

3379
02:18:04,471 --> 02:18:04,831
He said,
you know,

3380
02:18:04,831 --> 02:18:07,260
everybody that has a grappling event
wants to make up their own rules.

3381
02:18:07,261 --> 02:18:09,870
He said,
but as an industry for the gym owners,

3382
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:12,530
for the guys that are going into the gym
and they're training everyday,

3383
02:18:12,570 --> 02:18:15,660
they need to be able to train the same
way the coach needs to be able to have a

3384
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:17,340
stopwatch just like he does mma.

3385
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:18,870
Five minute rounds.
You do three of them.

3386
02:18:18,871 --> 02:18:21,720
If you're a man of intertidal fight,
you do five of you go to a basketball

3387
02:18:21,721 --> 02:18:22,300
court,
you go volume.

3388
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:24,000
It's the same universal rules.
He said,

3389
02:18:24,001 --> 02:18:27,110
for an industry,
we need to be all teammates,

3390
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,510
all Nogi Jujitsu.
They need to be able to train the same

3391
02:18:30,511 --> 02:18:33,030
way so the coach can run a practice and
it doesn't have to go.

3392
02:18:33,180 --> 02:18:37,370
You guys train to fraud Vodavi over here
and you guys train them for the Ibj f

3393
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:39,060
over here and you get.
So I thought,

3394
02:18:39,150 --> 02:18:39,960
Eddie,
you're right.

3395
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:43,440
If us promoters can all get together and
unify some rules,

3396
02:18:43,441 --> 02:18:46,080
like the unified rules of MMA as an
industry,

3397
02:18:46,081 --> 02:18:47,760
the trickle down,
which is the gyms,

3398
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:51,750
we could get this thing figured out and
then we can start to have a hybrid and

3399
02:18:51,751 --> 02:18:54,120
Eddie's rules really are quite perfect.
You know,

3400
02:18:54,121 --> 02:18:55,770
he calls them the most gangster rules
out there,

3401
02:18:55,771 --> 02:18:57,360
but he's right.
I talked to Vinnie,

3402
02:18:57,361 --> 02:18:58,710
I talked to some other guys that I
talked to.

3403
02:18:58,711 --> 02:19:00,600
I talked to Sala Rivera.
They're going,

3404
02:19:00,601 --> 02:19:01,650
look,
it's Ebi.

3405
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:04,230
That's how you find if you want to live
the best is you got to go.

3406
02:19:04,231 --> 02:19:05,064
Ebi Rules.

3407
02:19:05,090 --> 02:19:07,130
Yeah.
It really is the best and it stops all

3408
02:19:07,131 --> 02:19:09,020
these draws.
These draws are brutal.

3409
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:13,230
I mean you have that a polaris match.
You got all these amazing matchups and

3410
02:19:13,231 --> 02:19:16,780
then Gary Tonin verses Paul Harris,
draw other.

3411
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:18,010
Fuck.
You haven't draws.

3412
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:19,280
Everything is a draw,
draw,

3413
02:19:19,281 --> 02:19:20,114
draw,
draw.

3414
02:19:20,270 --> 02:19:22,250
You can have people get excited about
draws.

3415
02:19:22,251 --> 02:19:24,170
They don't get excited about draws.
That's not fun.

3416
02:19:24,270 --> 02:19:26,340
I talked to her about that and how it
goes.

3417
02:19:26,341 --> 02:19:26,990
You know,
I do have.

3418
02:19:26,990 --> 02:19:28,760
I do have one problem with that.
He said,

3419
02:19:28,770 --> 02:19:30,800
I guys are more,
I can get them to,

3420
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:33,080
to wrestle more guys kinda like that,
that clause,

3421
02:19:33,081 --> 02:19:35,090
and you got to have a time limit
somewhere and we don't quite know how to

3422
02:19:35,091 --> 02:19:36,140
figure out the overtime yet.
He said,

3423
02:19:36,141 --> 02:19:38,900
but the problem I'm running into is I
want to champion.

3424
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:41,130
He said,
and it's hard to build a division and to

3425
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:44,720
decide who's the next number one
contender if you don't have an

3426
02:19:44,721 --> 02:19:47,480
architecture in place where a guy
advances through a bracket,

3427
02:19:47,481 --> 02:19:49,100
if you will,
you have to have.

3428
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,330
You have to have a winter,

3429
02:19:50,510 --> 02:19:51,343
right?
Yeah.

3430
02:19:51,370 --> 02:19:53,450
Yeah.
That is a giant issue with,

3431
02:19:53,451 --> 02:19:55,190
uh,
everybody else's rule set.

3432
02:19:55,191 --> 02:19:59,270
I just think that if you look at
submission grappling and especially

3433
02:19:59,271 --> 02:20:03,020
people that have a problem with the
quote unquote violence of MMA,

3434
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:06,110
the submission aspect of it is,
it's beautiful to watch.

3435
02:20:06,111 --> 02:20:08,600
It's exciting,
it's dynamic and you watch someone get

3436
02:20:08,601 --> 02:20:09,950
choked out.
It's crazy.

3437
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:10,640
I mean it's,
it's,

3438
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:12,560
it's really interesting.
It's fun.

3439
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:15,350
It's a,
it's an exciting part of martial arts

3440
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:18,980
and it's something that guys can do when
they retire from fighting.

3441
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:22,280
It's something that a lot of people that
don't want to get involved in mma,

3442
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:26,940
but guys like the Mendez brothers or
there's a Gary Turner,

3443
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:29,090
he's actually probably going to do mma
eventually,

3444
02:20:29,091 --> 02:20:33,170
but all these super talented grapplers
it gives them an opportunity to show

3445
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:33,810
their stuff.

3446
02:20:33,810 --> 02:20:34,960
Yeah,
certainly.

3447
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,400
I love that.
You know who Tony is,

3448
02:20:36,430 --> 02:20:37,061
by the way.
You know,

3449
02:20:37,061 --> 02:20:39,110
he's so excited.
He's crazy.

3450
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:39,970
Oh yeah.
Turn it on.

3451
02:20:39,970 --> 02:20:40,600
Yeah,
he's.

3452
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:41,291
Yeah.
He's just.

3453
02:20:41,291 --> 02:20:43,990
He's fantastic.
But you've got so many guys like this.

3454
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:46,180
You know,
if you dangle that big carrot and all of

3455
02:20:46,181 --> 02:20:48,880
a sudden you're just signing the most
popular and the most famous guys.

3456
02:20:48,881 --> 02:20:51,280
It's kind of tough.
I really liked the Olympic model or even

3457
02:20:51,281 --> 02:20:53,800
the NCAA model.
The best guy always steps forward,

3458
02:20:53,801 --> 02:20:55,930
but the best guy,
a lot of times it has a hard time

3459
02:20:55,931 --> 02:20:57,910
getting a chance.
Promoters want guys that are going to

3460
02:20:57,911 --> 02:20:59,410
sell.
It's like,

3461
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:01,660
let's put that on hold.
If you're a good promoter,

3462
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,900
you'll figure out how to sell.
You just will.

3463
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:05,100
If you're a promoter,
use Dana's.

3464
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:08,420
You'll bring in the bells and whistles,
but let's give everybody a chance the

3465
02:21:08,421 --> 02:21:10,000
same way the Olympics Games does.
You know,

3466
02:21:10,001 --> 02:21:13,030
lets anybody that thinks they're best.
Raise your hand.

3467
02:21:13,031 --> 02:21:14,640
Let's get an error figured out.
Now we're gonna.

3468
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:16,120
Have to have a lot of events.
We're gonna have to work,

3469
02:21:16,270 --> 02:21:18,460
but let's get a system in place and
let's figure it out.

3470
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:20,020
Boom.
Boom.

3471
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:22,990
So instead of rules Ebi,
what is your event called?

3472
02:21:23,710 --> 02:21:28,660
It is called submission underground.
It can be found@flowcombat.com.

3473
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:30,640
It's free to all members.

3474
02:21:30,810 --> 02:21:32,410
What is this?
What does this video?

3475
02:21:32,411 --> 02:21:37,330
Let's play this video and let's end on
this video and anything more to tell

3476
02:21:37,331 --> 02:21:42,331
people.
I'm your son in ch on instagram a chain.

3477
02:21:43,540 --> 02:21:45,580
What does it entail and on?
On twitter.

3478
02:21:45,790 --> 02:21:47,110
Absolutely.
Facebook,

3479
02:21:47,111 --> 02:21:47,944
all that gentleman.
Yes.

3480
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:50,120
Thank you for the plug.
Bruce.

3481
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:52,010
Bruce buffer was going to announce the
show.

3482
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:55,790
He.
He fell on his acl as acl.

3483
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:59,150
Yeah.
He was doing a lip sync competition.

3484
02:21:59,151 --> 02:22:01,730
Yes.
And apparently he got up,

3485
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:06,320
he gutted it out and he tried to keep
going and they tipped over sideways and

3486
02:22:06,321 --> 02:22:07,670
fell over again.
It's hilarious.

3487
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,410
Sad.
Want Bruce to get better?

3488
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:11,030
Very funny.
Very funny.

3489
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:12,950
Unfortunate is the second time he blew
his knee out.

3490
02:22:12,951 --> 02:22:14,000
Doing that too.
By the way,

3491
02:22:14,210 --> 02:22:16,250
he blew his knee out.
That jumped that.

3492
02:22:16,251 --> 02:22:19,610
He does.
When he does that,

3493
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:21,560
he leaps in the air.
He blew his acl out.

3494
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:23,300
Doing that.
Wants to watch them live out of the

3495
02:22:23,301 --> 02:22:26,070
ring.
This is his second acl surgery.

3496
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:28,830
So it's,
it's a fucking hard job folks.

3497
02:22:28,890 --> 02:22:30,250
Okay.
Alright.

3498
02:22:30,530 --> 02:22:33,430
Chael and ladies and gentlemen,
and we'll end with this son and

3499
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:35,100
submission underground.
Again.

3500
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:36,810
Flow.
What does that mean?

3501
02:22:36,811 --> 02:22:37,480
Backflow.
Calm,

3502
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:38,820
calm,
calm.com.

3503
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:40,560
And it is this

3504
02:22:41,090 --> 02:22:43,640
July 17th live and free for all members

3505
02:22:43,870 --> 02:22:45,580
and we'll tweet it.
It'll be on my twitter,

3506
02:22:45,581 --> 02:22:48,130
so I'll let you guys know in advance.
Thank you brother.

3507
02:22:48,131 --> 02:22:51,040
Always great to have you on.
And anytime you want to come on again,

3508
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:53,130
open invitation.
Let's,

3509
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:54,023
let's play it

3510
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:57,210
son and,
and I am here to speak to you about the

3511
02:22:57,211 --> 02:23:00,900
pathetic state of affairs in today's
grappling competition.

3512
02:23:00,930 --> 02:23:03,420
When grapplers come with promotions,
bring these guys.

3513
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:05,820
They're not sending their best.
They're boring,

3514
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:08,040
they're dull,
they're not risk takers.

3515
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:12,180
I am going to change all of that.
No more 20 minute matches where it can

3516
02:23:12,181 --> 02:23:15,570
end in a draw.
What kind of atmosphere is in a drop?

3517
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:18,570
This is anti-competition one set of
rules.

3518
02:23:18,571 --> 02:23:21,840
Somebody must win and somebody must
lose.

3519
02:23:21,841 --> 02:23:23,010
Guys,
this is America.

3520
02:23:23,011 --> 02:23:25,110
We don't go to draw.
We play for keeps.

3521
02:23:25,111 --> 02:23:27,450
We play for somebody to get their hand
raised.

3522
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:28,650
Guys,
if you don't know,

3523
02:23:28,651 --> 02:23:31,330
you damn sure should know.
On July 17th,

3524
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:34,170
submission underground is invading
Portland.

3525
02:23:34,171 --> 02:23:36,960
Oregon's Roseland theater.
Now tickets are sold out,

3526
02:23:36,961 --> 02:23:39,390
but you still got a chance.
Go to your desktop,

3527
02:23:39,391 --> 02:23:41,160
grab your smartphone,
send a pigeon,

3528
02:23:41,161 --> 02:23:43,590
send a fax if you have to,
let your friends know.

3529
02:23:43,591 --> 02:23:46,920
Don't be left in the dark Monday morning
around the water cooler.

3530
02:23:46,921 --> 02:23:50,040
Don't be the only person that didn't
witness history.

3531
02:23:50,070 --> 02:23:54,900
Go to flow combat.com.
God bless America.

3532
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:56,303
Goodnight everybody.

3533
02:24:01,790 --> 02:24:02,650
That's a genius.
