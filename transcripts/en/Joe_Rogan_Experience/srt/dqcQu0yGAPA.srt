1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,780
Do Do,
do,

2
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:04,890
do,
do a three,

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:06,090
two,
one.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,640
Ladies and gentlemen.
Owen,

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,690
Benjamin,
how are you brother?

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,730
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for coming here man.

7
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:16,731
I appreciate it.
We're just talking about kind of being 

8
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:20,270
outside of the bubble of the big cities 
and living in a nice calm place.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,470
You know,
you're calling now.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,060
Yeah.
Like there's chickens.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,650
That's the move,
man.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,690
It's the move because you could visit,
you can visit this crazy fucked up 

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:30,690
place.
Yeah,

14
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,340
that's what,
that's why when you,

15
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:32,670
uh,
when you asked me to do this,

16
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,630
I was like,
yeah,

17
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,460
I'm excited to visit La and then I'll go
back to like,

18
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,610
you know,
my brother and my family and a mountain 

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:42,610
in a lake.
Yeah.

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,380
That's the way to do it.
If you could do it that way,

21
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,610
that's the way to do it.
Yeah.

22
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,790
See,
it's like there's some real benefits to 

23
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,611
living in a city,
but there's also some real benefits to 

24
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:52,611
being outside of it.

25
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:53,940
I think that figuring out some sort of 
50 slash 50 thing,

26
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:55,620
like you're doing like visit and then 
bolt,

27
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,910
that's the move.
Yeah.

28
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,320
It's also kind of altruistic,
like 3000 people.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,270
I go back and forth between here and 
there and I'm like,

30
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,750
if someone dies like everyone chips in,
if they can't afford it,

31
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:09,780
like that's it.
It works so well in small groups.

32
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:10,630
Yeah.
You know,

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,050
and then the bigger the group,
the more it gets a little dicey.

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,430
It's a totally different way of living.
I feel like living in a small group is,

35
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,410
you know,
as long as it's a good group,

36
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,430
you get stuck with a bad group and 
that's a real issue to some crazy meth 

37
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:29,601
heads that lived down the street and 
they'd like to shoot things up in the 

38
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:32,271
middle of the night.
Well that's part of your little small 

39
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:32,271
group and I delivered papers to those 
guys when I was a kid.

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,490
They just do the car thing or the bike 
thing,

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,250
bike and walk.
Oh,

42
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,700
someone stole my bike.
So I went back to walking.

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,180
You haven't been developed some serious 
fucking core muscles carrying around all

44
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:50,181
those newspapers.
Do you have a wagon or just do the bag 

45
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:50,181
thing now?
I did the bag thing.

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,970
I used to carry my dog in it wrong dude,
for real.

47
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:58,971
If you think about that,
like people put sandbags on or a weight 

48
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:02,331
vests on rather,
and they do all kinds of exercises and 

49
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:02,520
it's like 40 pounds.
Well if you're like an adult,

50
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,910
40 pounds is like a good amount of 
weight to do chin ups and pushups and 

51
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,760
stuff with a weight vest on.
If you're a little kid.

52
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,880
How old were you?
Nine to 13.

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Dude.
Think of how weak you are when you're 

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,640
nine and someone's strapping down 
newspapers on you.

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,410
Yeah.
That was Chubby to.

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,840
I bet it made you strong as fuck it.
It definitely helped me get into 

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:24,840
puberty.
Yeah,

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,511
for sure.
And also like people do that for 

59
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:29,511
exercise,
you know like farmer's walks.

60
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:30,330
You ever seen Pharma?
So yeah,

61
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:30,990
totally.
Hey,

62
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,570
put a bumper bar,
bar bell,

63
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,580
Kim's hill where he put a dumbbell in 
each hand and just walk or Kettlebell 

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,420
and just carry it.
Just walk,

65
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,450
just carry the weight of the world.
It also makes you emotionally strong to 

66
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,210
like be nine and like have to knock on a
door like a pimp,

67
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,760
you know?
It's only a dollar.

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,710
That's right.
You got to collect.

69
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,890
Got Call as always a giant issue 
collection.

70
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,250
Yeah.
I only had a couple people that had to 

71
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,901
collect from,
by the time that I had started 

72
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:00,460
delivering newspapers,
they figured out how to do like these,

73
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,890
uh,
withdrawals from people's accounts,

74
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,260
like,
you know,

75
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,740
they would do it,
pay for it in advance,

76
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,550
somehow know they're like,
get it like a bank account withdrawal or

77
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,000
something.

78
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,070
I didn't have to build them.
That wasn't my point.

79
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,310
But a couple people,
I didn't have these little envelopes.

80
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,030
You have to leave the Tan novel and they
put the money in the envelope.

81
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,010
It was so weird.
It was also outdated.

82
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,490
Yeah,
it was,

83
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,700
it was like 19th century newspaper 
delivery and also like,

84
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,400
uh,
if someone said they left it and,

85
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,430
and you know,
that they didn't like someone else took 

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:32,430
it and then they put it on a nine year 
old.

87
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,750
It was like,
it was intense to have to argue them 

88
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:36,750
down and be like,
no,

89
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:36,750
you do have to pay me.
I have overhead,

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,790
you know,
I've got my own girl and there's,

91
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,000
here's a little tip for people.
I don't,

92
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,350
I don't want to be that Dick,
but if someone asks,

93
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,500
if you put the the newspaper inside 
their door,

94
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,610
you kind of have to do it.

95
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,820
You got to do it.
That's a real drag if you're driving,

96
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,060
because if you're driving when you want 
to do is you want to just chuck that 

97
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,791
sucker down the either the pathway or in
the driveway and keep moving.

98
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,170
Boom.
You got a lot of newspaper,

99
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:02,620
son,
keep moving,

100
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,380
keep moving.
If you've got a volume business,

101
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,570
a volume business,
you know,

102
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,980
and they'd be like,
you know what,

103
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,600
we'll take care of you on Christmas.
I'm like,

104
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,460
too,
there's no way it can be worth it.

105
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,560
It's like way more.
It's cold out.

106
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,570
I gotta get out of the car.
I've got to carry it.

107
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,520
I got to go all the way up your walkway 
opening door.

108
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:21,550
That shit takes time.
She had to do that with every house.

109
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,320
It'd be impossible.
Impossible.

110
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,230
And also because the winters and we 
didn't have plastic,

111
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,540
you know,
I was in a very outdated system.

112
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,520
You didn't have plastic for the bags 
now.

113
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,050
Whoa,
that's crazy.

114
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,070
That doesn't even make sense now was it 
was a badly run newspaper.

115
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,360
We had plastic sometimes,
but sometimes we just have rubber bands.

116
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,090
Like there was a,
like depending on the weather,

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,360
he didn't always have plastic,
but then they moved to plastic like 

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,430
later.
New York Times always had plastic and it

119
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:53,431
was blue.
I took the New York Times route just 

120
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:56,851
because there was extra prestige and 
delivering the New York Times in my 

121
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:56,851
mind.
That's hilarious.

122
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,550
Drug.
No,

123
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm not usa today anymore.
Well,

124
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,220
I knew this guy who was really smart who
also delivered newspapers.

125
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,340
He was like a whole community of people 
that deliver newspapers because this one

126
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,080
guy,
one guy I remember this dude is very,

127
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:13,081
very smart guy.
He was a music composer and he drove a 

128
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:16,801
Hyundai and he was explaining to me how 
much engineering and time that the,

129
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,200
the,
the South Korea had gone into before 

130
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,200
they created this automobile.

131
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,930
He's like,
believe me,

132
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,840
he's like,
these will be so reliable,

133
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,640
like of Koreans are going to put out a 
car,

134
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:32,641
it's going to be the shit,
like they are not going to fuck it up 

135
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:36,000
and this dude delivered newspapers and 
he had the New York Times as part of us 

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,370
around.
I was like,

137
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,630
wow,
he's sophisticated.

138
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,440
He's into classical music.
He knows a lot about North Korea and 

139
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,440
South Korea.
Efficiency.

140
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,590
Yeah.
I didn't know shit.

141
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,180
I was like,
well,

142
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,210
how has this guy knows so much?
I just knew like dinosaurs and sharks,

143
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,530
like I would just constantly read about 
dinosaurs.

144
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,150
Like I could name every dinosaur,
but I didn't know anything about the New

145
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,150
York Times.
Did you see that new one that they 

146
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,150
found?
The titanic source.

147
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,470
Now that sounds incredible.
Fuck yeah.

148
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,220
Does it took me back to being 12 again.
Also us.

149
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,010
What an awesome new pterosaur yeah.
That would like explain it to my friends

150
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,080
and almost take it like it made me big.

151
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,880
It's so big,
like eight cars could fit in it.

152
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,790
Oh,
it would be like,

153
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:21,791
whoa.
I think they said it's something like 

154
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:21,791
eight elephants.
Something crazy like that.

155
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,150
Yeah,
it's gigantic.

156
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:28,151
It's the biggest dinosaur that they've 
ever discovered and I feel like they 

157
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:30,260
discovered it within the last decade 
with the size of this motherfucker.

158
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Jamie,
can you rewind that to the very 

159
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,860
beginning where you see the full body 
video really flow through.

160
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,070
The size is fucking thing.
Newly named speech is the largest mammal

161
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,900
animal.
Rather to ever walk the earth.

162
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,410
The titanosaur fossil was discovered in 
Argentina in 2013.

163
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,240
Am I saying it right?
Titanosaur.

164
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,220
Scientists use try dimensional 
reconstruction to measure the mass.

165
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,320
Ooh,
look at the size of that fucking thing.

166
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,890
God meet meter Veggie,
Veggie.

167
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,960
We're so lucky.
The thing could still be around.

168
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,520
It would win every fight.
This they did.

169
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,740
This is heavy as 12 elephants or a full 
Boeing 7:37.

170
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,890
Jesus fucking.
Oh,

171
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,030
oh,
that's unreal.

172
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,570
The skeleton at the American Museum of 
Natural History in New York is so large.

173
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,760
Dot Dot dot.
Well,

174
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,890
what is it that it's head sticks out?
Oh Shit.

175
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,130
That's embarrassing.
It's just too big of a dick.

176
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,300
Do you think duck ticks back then were 
just like 20 feet long?

177
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,070
Ducts?
Probably had like,

178
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:39,071
yeah,
I mean duct Dick's today can be like 

179
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:39,110
nine inches long for like a little tiny 
duck.

180
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,220
Right?
Isn't that the deal?

181
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,920
Like Andrea's Antonopoulos?
Uh,

182
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:47,921
he,
he thought for some reason it was like 

183
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:47,921
three feet long and he had me really 
super psyched.

184
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,650
It's still pretty big.
It's not quite three feet long,

185
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,900
but what a crazy,
a little scenario.

186
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:58,901
The ducks have had to like duck dick per
body ounce must be like massive,

187
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,650
massive,
like a thigh.

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,540
Right?
Like if you had an,

189
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,570
a literally had another thigh 
[inaudible] like the female duck has to 

190
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,150
Vaginas,
party pussy.

191
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,710
Well they use the dig,
dig and decide to let you in at every 

192
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,710
turn.
Yeah.

193
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,780
It's a labyrinth.
Yeah,

194
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,020
it's.
And that's why the duck dick is like 

195
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,971
this weird curly q apparatus type thing 
and the length because it's like the 

196
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,710
little tiny factors will affect the next
generation.

197
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:31,950
So like one duck had like a slightly 
longer windy or winter that could manage

198
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:36,951
the.
And there was this like really weird 

199
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,611
discussion,
this really weird scientific discussion 

200
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,180
about ducks and whether all ducks sex 
was rape.

201
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,580
And I'm trying to think,
I was in on that one,

202
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,300
but they were trying to determine but 
like coming from someone like me who has

203
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:52,301
chickens and I'd get to see these 
animals behavior and other birds that 

204
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:57,131
I've watched in my neighborhood.
I posted a picture on instagram 

205
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:57,131
recently,
a hawk.

206
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:57,131
There's a

207
00:08:57,131 --> 00:09:00,980
hawk war going on in my neighborhood and
wow hawks are killing hawks and they 

208
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,050
kill them and they,
they cut their heads off and then they,

209
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:09,051
they eat parts of their body.
I'm pretty sure it's hawks doing it 

210
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:11,910
because one of my neighbors saw a hawk 
eating another hawk,

211
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,250
like a baby hawk in nest.
Whoa.

212
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,410
Yeah.
So they think that somehow another these

213
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:21,411
hawks,
he's young juvenile hawks are fighting 

214
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:23,280
to try to take over this area.
It's like gang stuff,

215
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,420
dude.
It is gang stuff.

216
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:29,421
One of them came swooping into my 
chicken coop the other day who has 

217
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:29,421
slammed into the cage outside of the 
chicken coop,

218
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,550
like the door was shut,
but it slammed into it like it was 

219
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,550
trying to get in and get the chicken.
So I was like,

220
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,610
Whoa,
this dude is bolded.

221
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,280
Fuck,
I got an owl in my hood trying to get my

222
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:41,070
chickens to you are scary.

223
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,980
Bowels are terrifying.
They could take out a dog.

224
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,970
They're a big animal man.
People fucked up with our,

225
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,010
with those God damn movies,
making them the wise old cute thing 

226
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,720
because it was still flying terror.
They're just out there to test and 

227
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,391
lollipops and you know,
and giving out wisdom and lollipops and 

228
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,100
given out wisdom.
Mad Dude.

229
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,660
When you see one in real life,
you're like,

230
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,430
oh,
you're a fucking dinosaur.

231
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,570
Oh my God.
Damn.

232
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,290
Flying talent covered dinosaur.
Yeah.

233
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,890
They took out a few of my chickens and I
got.

234
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,050
I got pretty pissed too.
I'm sure they did.

235
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,940
I'm sure they did.
You know what man?

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I am thinking in my neighborhood that 
someone used some sort of a rodent 

237
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:26,361
pesticide interest.
I really think that happened because I 

238
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:30,351
was reading about this,
that some owls wind up dying because in 

239
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:35,451
coyotes as well,
because they'll eat rodents that were 

240
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:38,200
infected by this road and this road in 
pesticide is poison.

241
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,180
They give for rats.
Just rat poison and animals eat the rats

242
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:47,181
and then they get it and die off and 
they were talking about our goals and 

243
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:50,421
specific were really important for 
taking control of a population of 

244
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:51,420
rodents.
Got Suite next to.

245
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,890
We still think of what they are mad.
They are flying murderers.

246
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,000
We just,
we,

247
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,190
we made them something cute.
Yeah.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Know like when you live in the woods,
it's your confirmed with that 

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,341
constantly.
He's a raccoon sketch like raccoons can 

250
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,350
in their intelligence level.
Like my brother had to kill them with a 

251
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,260
pitchfork recently.
Oh Jesus Christ.

252
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,870
Yeah.
It was.

253
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,530
Oh my.
I was trying to kill chickens.

254
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,780
Oh yeah.
And they'll,

255
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,840
they'll open like locks and stuff.
Like they have like fingers enhance did.

256
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,900
There was one in my neighborhood and he 
was coming towards the chicken coop at 

257
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:26,900
night and the chickens were going crazy.

258
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,720
It was late at night and I show him the 
flashlight on him and he started walking

259
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,160
towards it.
Oh Man.

260
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,690
I was like,
fuck this.

261
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,610
Fuck this.
I'm out of here man.

262
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,490
And there's sound or scream is nuts.
Oh fuck that.

263
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,490
I want to hear a raccoon screen.
I saw guardians of the galaxy.

264
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,730
That little dude was the scariest guy.
Yeah,

265
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,690
a little raccoon with the guns and 
smart.

266
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,300
He was smart as fuck.
You see two.

267
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,940
Haven't seen two yet,
Dude.

268
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,250
I cried on the plane watching it sweetie
now.

269
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,010
But like I don't really cry much in 
life,

270
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,010
but every now and then

271
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,010
like some big archetypal movie,
we'll just grab me.

272
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,930
They can get you to.
Especially once you're a parent,

273
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,140
you know,
they're much more vulnerable.

274
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,170
What does that a duck dick.
We're looking at a duck duck right 

275
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,170
there.
How is that even real?

276
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,360
They had here on the forced copulations 
male ducks are notorious for attempting 

277
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,370
force copulation with females,
so females seem to have involved vaginas

278
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:20,371
to make it hard for a male duck to 
actually inseminate them if they don't 

279
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:22,000
want to by forcing it towards the dead 
ends.

280
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,290
Oh Wow.
They have dead ends.

281
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,480
They have like trap doors.
Of course,

282
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,880
male ducks haven't taken this lying 
down.

283
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,940
The more forced copulation a duck 
engages in,

284
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,320
the longer the male's penis is tend to 
be according to a 2010 study.

285
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,510
Whoa.
So their dicks get longer.

286
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:42,511
The more they rape.
I wonder if the female duck like laughs 

287
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,280
a letter like when the rapey ducks like 
mad and she's like man,

288
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,890
because she like sent them the wrong 
way.

289
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Maybe she's going to be pregnant,
but I just keep spelling calories.

290
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,520
Look at this,
this quote.

291
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,690
In fact,
male ducks grow a new penis every year,

292
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,620
which means they can vary the length 
depending on that year's competition.

293
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,580
Holy Shit.
You've mentioned if you.

294
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,050
Dick fell off every year like elk 
antlers and every year it grew back like

295
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,130
for like months nobody had sex and 
everybody was cool with each other and 

296
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,130
we're like,
God,

297
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,401
can we just be like this all the time?
Like imagine if there was just like we 

298
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:18,550
had a season half.
Maybe that's our problem.

299
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:21,010
We're such gluttons we should have a 
breeding season.

300
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,160
We should have a season where literally 
our Dick Falls off.

301
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,770
Such an egg grows back.
It grows back.

302
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:31,771
Look,
if you could reengineer people to have 

303
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:34,921
like a three month period,
like a participants have off seasons 

304
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:37,120
level off season where this no gender,
so there's no male,

305
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,500
there's no female,
there's no nothing.

306
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
Everybody.
Dick falls off and everybody just chills

307
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,930
out for a little bit and doesn't think 
about anything but just life existential

308
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,090
shit,
you know,

309
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,060
get some rental property.
Think about like going to the beach more

310
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,460
like why don't I go to the beach more?
I always enjoy it.

311
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Feels good when I'm there and then the 
Dick size and shape will tell you what 

312
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,821
the year is to come out.
It's a 15 inch or we got some serious 

313
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:00,160
war ahead of us.
We've got problems.

314
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,930
Yeah.
Because like um,

315
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,730
chimp,
chimp ball size is directly 

316
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,590
proportionate to the amount of slots 
that are near them.

317
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,050
Whoa.
That's the thing with primates.

318
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:16,051
For some reason there was some 
correlation between promiscuous females 

319
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:19,660
and I'm like women having sex with more 
than one in a derogatory term.

320
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,690
Just scientifically.
There were saying that women who are 

321
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:24,690
having sex with more,
more males,

322
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,660
those males grew bigger dicks and bigger
balls.

323
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,210
Sperm competition.
Yeah,

324
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,370
like literally a balls got bigger.
I think that was like provable and want 

325
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,630
to know if the Deq was provable.
People feel weird about studying dicks.

326
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,990
They do and there's so much.
There's so many great stories if you 

327
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,320
study a day,
but if you're a dick dr people like,

328
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:49,321
hey,
why that fall into that box for years.

329
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,810
That's what I prefer to call them.
It's the correct nomenclature.

330
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,430
You know,
everyone wants to say penis,

331
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:58,600
but my daddy was a cock doctor.
His daddy was a cocktail doctor.

332
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,700
We've always been studying.
It seemed so important that everyone is 

333
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,570
so ashamed of.
You read sperm wars.

334
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,680
You know what?
No,

335
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,410
I did not,
but I think that's been disproven.

336
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,800
There was a study that they did where 
they could not recreate the idea that 

337
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,440
some sperm actually attack sperm and 
killed them.

338
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,370
They couldn't.

339
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,300
They couldn't show that there was a real
differentiation in cells.

340
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,510
Like there were cells that have the 
ability to go out and kill other sperm.

341
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,870
They were saying that that was more 
theoretical than anything in the guy who

342
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,360
originally wrote.
It might've like leap to a conclusion.

343
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,160
I can see that obviously,
I don't know shit,

344
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,490
but this is just what I had read was 
that like scientifically it doesn't 

345
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,880
really Jive,
but what does jive is with,

346
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,560
with primates,
this idea that the more females around,

347
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,670
the more you grow more balls and you 
grow bigger loads.

348
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,950
I'm sure that definitely about load 
size.

349
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,540
Do you think they measure load size 
though?

350
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,120
How are they going to hold on chimp 
before you come?

351
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,070
Come over here.
A little fella.

352
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,680
Bunch of pull out and.
And come on this trip over here.

353
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,880
Yeah.
How would you be able to tell?

354
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,770
How would you be able to study chimp?
Load size?

355
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Probably just surrounded with a bunch of
squatty champs and then one brave dude 

356
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,840
just has to check them off.
You know,

357
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:15,590
ones that brave champs will just rip 
your face off.

358
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Plus they know that a hand job is not 
the best thing we can do better than 

359
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:20,670
this.
Yeah.

360
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,590
Especially with a big old scientist man.
Hand start socking or you're not going 

361
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,190
to get a sample.
Yeah.

362
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,200
And if it's a lady scientist,
you can't let a lady scientist go in 

363
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,920
there jerk-off a chimp because that's 
like some sort of prostitution almost,

364
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,510
right.
So it'd have to be a dude.

365
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,420
Either way.
The chimps gonna fuck you up if he wants

366
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:41,150
to beat the shit out of you while you're
jerking him off.

367
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,270
Yeah.
That would just be such a weird beating 

368
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:46,940
black eyes jerking off a champion.

369
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,310
He freaked out.
He feels vulnerable at all.

370
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:54,370
Like you're going too hard.
Just like I get vulnerable with 

371
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:54,560
handjobs.
Yeah.

372
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,320
Could you imagine if you like hurt 
chimps,

373
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:56,780
Dick?
I mean,

374
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,880
it's not like you guys are communicating
in English or anything,

375
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,920
right?
You just jerking him off and you look 

376
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:03,920
down and be like,
hey buddy,

377
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:03,920
it's going to be good.
I'm going to.

378
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,320
You're going to come so hard.
And then like maybe you fucked up.

379
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:07,840
You like maybe he likes it rough and you
kill them.

380
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:10,940
A couple of hard shakes and he just beat
you to a pulp.

381
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,350
Yeah.
Because you keep hitting these balls and

382
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:17,351
you don't realize it.
Just grabbing his dick in a way that 

383
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:17,570
he's uncomfortable with anymore.
It's like I don't trust you anymore,

384
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,900
so before you movements were soft and 
sensual and they seem like controlled 

385
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,060
now you can't get on my dick.
It's like now you've got an agenda about

386
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,470
this hand job.
Yeah,

387
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,530
and I think to a chimp,
like any kind of violent display like 

388
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,441
that,
that's like some sort of dominance 

389
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:37,361
display.
When a chimp takes a stick and starts 

390
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:40,001
banging it on another stick,
their balls get big and they just start 

391
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:40,320
punching.
I don't know if that's how it happens to

392
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,740
balls get big with violence.
That's a good question.

393
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,130
That's a real good question.
I wonder if there's a correlation 

394
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,130
between violence and um,
how much intercourse they have

395
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,180
because like I'm the Bonobos have the 
most sex.

396
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,190
Would they have the least violence?
Right.

397
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,180
I wonder if that's just because that's 
just who they are because they're weird.

398
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,760
They're,
they don't,

399
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,570
they don't.
Like,

400
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,170
they don't do a lot of the shit that 
regular chimps do now.

401
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:05,950
And the females will just,
it's a,

402
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,860
it's a,
it's a really funny nature channel.

403
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:08,970
And it's like,
yeah,

404
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,170
we have a male being angry and then it's
like.

405
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,450
And then like five checks of you,
like just start fucking him and now he's

406
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:19,910
asleep in the banana leaves role has 
been averted for thousands of years.

407
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,280
Have they figured it out?
Just have a big old fuck party everyday.

408
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,600
Just drained balls and pussies as well.
We just keep everybody calm.

409
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:29,520
Everybody fucks everybody.
Everyone's fucking.

410
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,610
Yeah.
Because then you think it might be your 

411
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,201
kid too.
So you have to like protect all the 

412
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:36,201
kids.

413
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,390
They have rules.
The only rule is a mother will not have 

414
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,720
sex with a son.
That's a solid rule.

415
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,100
This is the only one though,
guys.

416
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,990
Fuck their daughters.
It's weird.

417
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,570
It's weird.
The whole thing is,

418
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:46,740
um,
it's,

419
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,590
they have a strange system in that 
regard.

420
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:54,591
Like this is the one taboo at this 
incredibly promiscuous culture,

421
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,330
or I guess you'd call them a culture 
species has.

422
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,810
They're fascinating man because there's 
so much like regular champs,

423
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,610
but they're not violent at all.
Hardly.

424
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,460
They'd like make some noise and shit,
but they don't do much yet.

425
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:09,710
Almost perfectly splits our psyches as 
humans to low.

426
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,330
We all have champion been oboe and us.
Well.

427
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,420
Just knowing that that's possible too.
Yeah.

428
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,000
Like that.
What what we are is just sort of like,

429
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,910
you know,
even like what we are as a culture,

430
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,200
it's just sorta Kinda like worked into 
this spot and that's what it is.

431
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,800
You know,
what,

432
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,700
what we are.
It didn't have to work out this way.

433
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,850
You know,
it could have worked out some other 

434
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,291
really weird way,
like all life forms that you see around 

435
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:36,570
me.
We can be dolphins,

436
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:41,571
they think dolphins are as smart as us.
They think it's entirely possible that 

437
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,800
without the context of our culture,
like our ability to display intelligence

438
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:48,801
through tests and math and can building 
things engineering to without any 

439
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,170
ability to display that.
We don't really know how smart they 

440
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,141
actually are.
We just assume that the social 

441
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:58,130
intelligence they have is not as 
valuable as that.

442
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,330
The intelligence is evolving and 
creating things,

443
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,280
but they have a cerebral cortex is 40 
percent larger than a person's pets.

444
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:06,900
Intense.
It's intense.

445
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,930
There's all our.
All our tests are based on what we 

446
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:11,930
value.
Yeah,

447
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:11,930
exactly.
Exactly.

448
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,530
Well,
what we appreciate.

449
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,540
I mean,
I'm sure there's some other tests that 

450
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,341
they do and they know that some really 
complex language that they have that 

451
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:19,890
they don't,
they can't decipher,

452
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,070
they still haven't figured out what the 
fuck they're saying.

453
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,550
They know that there's dialects,
they know there's dialects and they know

454
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:29,160
that dolphins can understand a lot of 
the things that we tell them.

455
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,430
But uh,
they,

456
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,610
they don't exactly know what the fuck 
they're saying.

457
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,260
That's for sure.
They've never broken it down,

458
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,060
like to remembering the close 
encounters.

459
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,700
Do they broke it down?
You're like,

460
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:40,250
oh,
there's a whole language here will see,

461
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,560
you know,
and they tried to figure out what the 

462
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,151
language was there.
They've been studying dolphin language 

463
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:47,151
forever and they're like,
who knows what the fuck?

464
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:48,220
They're saying two dolphins

465
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,680
blowing my mind.
Dude,

466
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:54,681
there are.
But they also do some fucked up shit 

467
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:55,540
too.
They do a lot of infanticide.

468
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,280
Sex Slaves.
Yeah.

469
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:02,310
They kill babies.
It's a real common thing like it is in 

470
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,860
all of nature.
Unfortunately,

471
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,980
males killed the babies.
Have A,

472
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,950
you know,
if it's not his kids,

473
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,540
find a woman who killed her babies.
It's really crazy that that's,

474
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,870
that's the code of somehow or another 
and that was the way to do it,

475
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,920
like Ooh,
like somehow or another of all the years

476
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:25,900
of these things trying to improve to get
to the position they're at now,

477
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,840
to be the most sturdy,
the most viable,

478
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:30,340
the most complex,
the most,

479
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,790
the most able to figure out a way to 
survive have to all that.

480
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:38,791
One of the options for one of the 
smartest things on the planet is eat 

481
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,590
babies get eat the babies of other 
dudes.

482
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,650
Yeah.
It's like a race to the bottom and 

483
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:46,650
morality for efficiency on Allen because
it's like it's.

484
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,030
You can see how quickly that works.
You know your genes go,

485
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:51,670
there's don't,
but it's like so disturbing.

486
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,190
Here's the thing.
Do you think that there's a massive.

487
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,220
I mean there's got to be a massive,
massive advantage in being able to 

488
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,271
physically record things that people 
have learned and to be able to recreate 

489
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:09,970
them in the way that only we can.
Like as much as we can say that dolphins

490
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,470
are intelligent and I'm sure they are 
and they might,

491
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,200
their brains might work better than 
ours.

492
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,300
Who the fuck knows,
but our brains,

493
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,020
we have this weird ability to manipulate
things on dry land and that means we 

494
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:27,151
figured out electricity and that means 
we figured out electronics that we've 

495
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:28,030
figured out.
Electronic storage and shit like this,

496
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,410
the Internet,
twitter,

497
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,650
instagram,
instantaneous access to information 

498
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:34,650
about stuff.

499
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,390
Like that's just changing everything.
Yeah.

500
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:42,391
Because most like a life form.
It's unreal because we can act out 

501
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:45,751
things in the abstract and not actually 
have to do them and then create 

502
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:45,751
something bigger.
Yeah.

503
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:49,990
But I'm not sure we're smarter.
I think collectively we are,

504
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,650
but like as individuals,
like dolphin literally might be like a 

505
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,120
more potent mind than ours.
Yeah.

506
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,870
Well pigeons or have incredible 
abilities that we don't have really?

507
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,870
Yeah.
They can go like five,

508
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,910
6,000
miles to the same spot without a map or 

509
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,220
rightly those homing pigeons.
Yeah.

510
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,060
The,
what are they using?

511
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:13,270
Like magnetic fields,
what are they using now?

512
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,040
I mean that to me is so intense.
You know,

513
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,800
Nicola Tesla was in love with a pigeon.
Oh yeah,

514
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,870
I heard that on this show,
actually talking about that.

515
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,630
That's hilarious.
That guy was deep.

516
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,090
Yeah.
He could make money on any of his own 

517
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,090
shit that all he could do is just love 
that pigeon.

518
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,120
Well,
he was just so super duper off the 

519
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,460
charts smart.
Yeah.

520
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,490
That,
I think he had a tremendous difficulty 

521
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:41,980
in interacting with regular people,
you know,

522
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,860
and this guy just wasn't the best 
businessman in the world.

523
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,850
He was just a super genius inventor.
That's what he was crazy though.

524
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,100
Massively,
massively.

525
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:52,640
Um,
W,

526
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,110
what would it be?
The word eccentric?

527
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,650
Yeah.
I think there's a level of intelligence 

528
00:23:59,650 --> 00:23:59,650
where you start almost becoming 
destructive.

529
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,380
You know,
it's like that funny bought on south 

530
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,380
South Park.
Remember I was like,

531
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,050
the greatest joke in the world is to 
kill everyone and say awkward where like

532
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,870
if you do the math of stakes of jokes 
and then like the,

533
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,230
like all the math of it,
it could get real dark.

534
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,990
And that's kind of like,
some people are so smart.

535
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,460
They're like,
why wouldn't I love a pigeon?

536
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,290
It can go 5,000
miles,

537
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:21,860
you know,
and you're like,

538
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,490
they don't have that thing that tells 
them just weird.

539
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,380
Yeah.
Well he didn't care anymore.

540
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:32,381
I think he loved the pigeon more than he
loved people and it might not have been 

541
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:35,141
like a romantic love.
Might've been like some spiritual thing 

542
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,560
he ever seen that there's one photo of 
him that's so iconic.

543
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,830
It's Nikola Tesla sitting in front of a 
pair of Tesla coils and he's got his 

544
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:44,630
legs crossed and he looks like the 
master of the universe.

545
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:47,780
He literally looks like a character in a
marvel comic book.

546
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,540
That guy was a wizard,
like a lid.

547
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,790
Literal Wizard,
you know?

548
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
I mean,
how,

549
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,210
how,
what?

550
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,480
Look at this guy look at this 
motherfucker.

551
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,580
He's sitting there reading shit.
He's,

552
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,620
he's sitting there with his legs crossed
in this crazy electrical thing is going 

553
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:10,240
on behind them and that's the guy that 
would fall in love with pigeon.

554
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,520
That was like in his mind,
he's like,

555
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,850
yeah,
I'll just make all these crazy sparks 

556
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:18,850
with my brain and read a book and then 
just.

557
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:18,850
Well,
the pigeon.

558
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,530
Can you imagine what it must be like to 
be a guy as smart as that like clearly 

559
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,450
like a next level intellect.
Like there's like us,

560
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:31,451
there's normal folks and then there's 
these like super genius like you know,

561
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,630
like a Lebron James of thinking,
Jesus Christ,

562
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,520
what the fuck?
How's he doing that?

563
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,690
And that's what that guy was imagined.
Being that guy and just seeing all these

564
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:43,250
things that haven't been figured out 
yet.

565
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,460
How come you guys have done this?
That must be so frustrating about doing 

566
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,281
this.
How about you have electricity just sit 

567
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:52,840
in the air.
You wanted to fucking pump electricity 

568
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:52,840
in the air where you would get it for 
free.

569
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,790
Like the radio.
That must be like being around drunk 

570
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,551
people all the time,
like being that smart around normal 

571
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:03,431
people.
It's like being sober at a bar and I've 

572
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,700
ever been to like on my penis and you're
like,

573
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,810
what's wrong with you?

574
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,570
And that's probably Tesla with like us.
It's like,

575
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:10,520
oh,
you can't just make the sparks.

576
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,580
It's a very good way of describing it.
It's a very good way of describing it.

577
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,980
That's probably exactly what's going on.
I've talked to a bunch of like really,

578
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:23,981
really smart people and at the time 
doing this podcast and then off 

579
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:28,181
podcasts.
One of my favorite examples is John 

580
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:28,181
Carmack.
Do you know who he is?

581
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:33,160
He's like this super genius coder who 
wrote the Three d engine for id 

582
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,420
software.
I guess he'd be like,

583
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,530
be like the lead programmer or something
for it software.

584
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,050
One of the founders like quake and doom 
and all those three d games.

585
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:44,100
Like he invented those things sunrail 
and

586
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,910
every time I talked to him I'm like,
I'm barely your species.

587
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,260
Fairly.
Same species.

588
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,890
His brain is firing so hard and so fast.
You're like,

589
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:54,420
wow,
I'm such an ape.

590
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Or you can see that on twitter with Sam 
Harris sometimes and sometimes he'll do 

591
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,560
a comeback and I'm like,
I got to read like nine books.

592
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,750
Even get that Sam stupid smart.
It's like crazy smart.

593
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,910
He's very smart,
very smart.

594
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,380
There's a lot of people like thought 
man,

595
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,820
and they'll uh,
they'll give you a real reality check if

596
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,070
you think you're smart.
You think you're an exceptional mind.

597
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,090
My wife has her masters in structural 
engineering and a lot of my buddies are 

598
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,260
super conspiracy shit.
Nine slash 11 truther no,

599
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,810
that's what happened.
That's what happened.

600
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:29,811
One of my biases do.
They proved that a building can't fall 

601
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:30,720
that way and my wife just called me just
goes,

602
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,520
but I'm they.

603
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,950
Oh Shit.
She's like,

604
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:39,951
I know how the structure of buildings 
work and she wasn't saying it 

605
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:39,951
maliciously.
She was like trying to be like,

606
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,350
no,
but I'm write silly.

607
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,700
There's still,
you know,

608
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,500
it could still be a thing.
I'm not saying it isn't true.

609
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:51,501
I'm just saying that like she was saying
it is possible for a building to fall 

610
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:52,050
directly on top of itself is all she was
saying.

611
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Well you know,
that whole tower seven thing so 

612
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,771
fascinating because that's the one thing
where everybody points to when it comes 

613
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:05,271
to nine slash 11.
Now what a lot of people don't know is 

614
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:07,620
that there's a longer video.
When you watch the thing collapse,

615
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,960
it absolutely looks like a controlled 
demolition.

616
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,620
And the problem with that is if you're 
not an actual engineer and you don't 

617
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,800
really know how they built that 
building,

618
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:20,670
it was unusual if you don't really know 
enough about it.

619
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,640
Like there's a lot of things that I kind
of know about,

620
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,470
but I don't really like if I,
if someone had,

621
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,880
if I had to explain a double clutch 
transmission and like a,

622
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:34,260
a bmw,
I think I could half asset.

623
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,690
But if there was someone right next to 
me that knew,

624
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,570
that really knew about it,
they would go with the fuck.

625
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:41,190
Are you talking about,
you know?

626
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Yeah.
Like the half truth confidence can be 

627
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,240
hilarious.
Oh yeah.

628
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,890
We gotta be real careful with that shit.
It's like,

629
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:51,891
listen,
I've read buzzfeed know you have this 

630
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:55,260
like this knowledge balls without.
Because that's what's a getting a little

631
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:57,900
infuriating with me now is a lot of the 
things being debated.

632
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,210
I actually know a ton about.
And like,

633
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:01,920
like I was a world war two history 
major.

634
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Like who lived in the Czech Republic,
studying authoritarian governments and 

635
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,280
stuff.

636
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,520
And like so like,
I mean I'm not like an expert expert.

637
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:14,521
Like you sometimes you have people on 
the show actually read books about tons 

638
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:18,290
we're about.
So when they get the most basic things 

639
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:18,290
about the,
everyone's a Nazi,

640
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,740
this is and then you because then you 
can't point out the actual Nazis and you

641
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,780
know,
and just how it and everyone thinks that

642
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:28,170
it's left wing right wing,
but it's really not like,

643
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,630
like right wing dystopia would be like 
Mad Max.

644
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Like there's no government at all and 
left his communist or socialist fascism.

645
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,850
It's just like the government is 
everything.

646
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,830
Yeah.
You what man?

647
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,180
I'm,
I felt the need for everything to be 

648
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,640
conspiracy is a real problem.
It's a real problem for a lot of people 

649
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,040
that need to know that they're right 
about things is a real problem.

650
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:54,900
You know,
the,

651
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,150
the not admitting that you don't really 
know part is a problem because until 

652
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:06,481
you.
Until I'm absolutely certain that what 

653
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:07,900
you're saying like I have to know when 
I'm talking to you,

654
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,170
if you say I'm absolutely 100 percent 
positive,

655
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,280
that if I liked this paper on fire,
it'll burn 100 percent.

656
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,650
If this is regular paper and I have a 
regular fire,

657
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,140
I'm 100 percent positive.
I have to.

658
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,440
If I have to hear you say if I have to 
know that that's how you really are 

659
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,361
operating.
So if you're telling me it's 100 

660
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:30,640
percent,
the Kennedys driver shot him.

661
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,140
Dude,
it's 100 percent.

662
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,160
You watched the video.

663
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,300
It's 100 percent.
Kennedy's drivers shot him or any,

664
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:40,301
any kind of crazy conspiracy like that.
As soon as you say you know for sure 

665
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:41,660
it's like God damn man to a,
you know,

666
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,900
for sure that it wasn't a plane hit the 
Pentagon,

667
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,010
you know,
for sure.

668
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,510
How do you know for sure?
Right.

669
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,660
I agree with you completely.
You can't know for sure and if everyone 

670
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,591
agrees,
like I always get freaked out when like 

671
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:55,591
everybody agrees on everything.
I feel like I'm in a cult.

672
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:56,020
Yeah.
It gets,

673
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,370
it gets super culting bolt on both sides
as being a skeptical person.

674
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:05,670
Like there's a lot of people that are 
skeptics that they'll look at things 

675
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:05,670
even like operation northwoods and 
there'll be like,

676
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,050
well,
that just.

677
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,600
It didn't.
No big deal.

678
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:10,090
If they were planning on killing 
Americans,

679
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,780
they were going to rm Cuban friendlies 
and have them attack one bay.

680
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,990
They were trying to get us to go to war 
with Cuba and they were going to 

681
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,631
manipulate us.
They were going to blow up a drone 

682
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:22,420
jetliner and blaming on Cuba,
so we'd be outraged.

683
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,880
We want to go over and kick Cuba's ass 
would cost.

684
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,270
Who knows?
Countless thousands of American lives 

685
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,270
for sure because you know you're talking
about 1961 or two or whatever it was 

686
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:38,101
when they.
When Kennedy vetoed this shit signed by 

687
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:38,290
the Joint Chiefs of staff,
they were really going to do this.

688
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,080
Like anybody who doesn't look at that 
and get disturbed.

689
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,640
This is from the freedom of Information 
Act.

690
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,760
That's not a conspiracy.
The problem with the really wacky 

691
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,910
conspiracies like Kennedy's drivers shot
him or you know the,

692
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:51,550
the,
the goes deep as you want.

693
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:56,670
Yeah.
The really wacky ones distract from the 

694
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:56,670
real ones.
They mask it.

695
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,530
It makes it so nothing means anything 
else.

696
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,080
Alex Jones was st something fucking 
crazy today.

697
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:06,040
Like there was Jewish actors pretending 
to be Nazis in Charlottesville.

698
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,780
Like these guys had tattoos of swastikas
on their chest.

699
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,960
It's not a fucking.
He's not Jewish person because you're 

700
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:15,960
not supposed to get tattooed.
Right.

701
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,910
It's not a fucking actor.
Once you tattoo a swastika on your chest

702
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,740
that you're not acting anymore,
right.

703
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:22,480
You've committed to a team.
Jesus.

704
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:28,070
That's like one of the biggest steps I 
can possibly think of as a human being 

705
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,210
is to go to a tattoo parlor and be like,
give me the fucking craziest one.

706
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,360
I saw this a gay flag Nazi thing to try 
to take the swastika back.

707
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,130
That's like a bid that I had

708
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,130
in 2014 about Cammo.
I was talking about those duck dynasty 

709
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,950
guys are.
They kept talking shit about gay people.

710
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,940
I'm like,
dude,

711
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:49,310
they're going to take over cammo.
They'll fuck with you.

712
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,930
And they'll just,
they'll just.

713
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,200
Every gay porno from now on takes place 
in Cammo.

714
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,320
It's like trucker hats,
like a lead from like truckers being 

715
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320
like,
we're fucking great.

716
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,810
And then a minute later they're like,
I'm not Justin Bieber.

717
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:04,270
I just like Miller lite.
Yeah.

718
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,510
The idea was that every porno film ever 
made would be made in a duck blind.

719
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,770
The average Jane Porno,
bro,

720
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:12,080
that's fucking genius,
and every.

721
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,340
They would all start out with this way,
man.

722
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,770
Gai is black guy.
You could ever find going some about 

723
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:19,770
duck hunting.
Make me hold.

724
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,680
That's fucking genius.
White dude comes in on chains and drops 

725
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,280
to his knees.
Start sucking.

726
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,200
That's they're all in Cammo because 
that.

727
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:36,250
Because then they can't just do it 
without like having to apologize to 

728
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:36,250
people and be like,
dude,

729
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,510
we're not into all that shit.
My point was like,

730
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,350
it started like they took over the 
rainbow.

731
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,480
They could take over that too.
They can take over Cammo.

732
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,330
They can take over everything.
Connected visual light.

733
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,580
Yeah.
Light sticks,

734
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,930
yellow,
green,

735
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:48,470
blue,
indigo.

736
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:49,370
It's like,
you know,

737
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:50,720
most,
most people just have.

738
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,170
It's like,
oh,

739
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:52,190
we're the environmental.
It's like,

740
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:53,120
oh,
you get green.

741
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,540
It's like we're saying we want all the 
fucking cars to get it like a southern 

742
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:02,570
accent immediately.
What do you think the gay brainbow thing

743
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,440
has done to the Leprechaun industry?
Probably tripled it.

744
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,480
Crippled it,
that they think they got gold,

745
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,160
they find a gay bar in the middle of 
Ireland.

746
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,940
Thousands of it was.
It was about finding a pot of gold of 

747
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:21,080
the rainbow.
Now it's about what happened,

748
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:27,330
what the fuck did they do because they 
culturally appropriate and it from the 

749
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,091
leprechaun culturally,
appropriately or from the leprechauns 

750
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:31,880
and fucking owned it.
Owned it.

751
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:34,220
Like shoot.
Tip owns cotton swabs.

752
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,340
Owned,
owned it in a period of like what?

753
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,660
10,
20 years.

754
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,420
All colors.
They own the rainbow,

755
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:44,420
the whole Rainbow Reiki.
If you think about when,

756
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,960
when the fuck was the rainbow first 
discovered long time ago,

757
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:53,210
long time ago,
when was the first Leprechaun story,

758
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,240
the pot of gold.
That's probably hundreds of years of 

759
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,330
leprechauns being associated with 
rainbows.

760
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,670
Right?
And now it's just dude and dudes.

761
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,900
Just one day it just became,
it just turned and that's a hard turn to

762
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,070
from like,
oh,

763
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,050
it's sunny and rainy at the same time.
Oh,

764
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:14,000
now it's gay and it's just also taking 
all the colors.

765
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,840
I just felt like,
you know,

766
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:18,170
gun control was the orange color and 
it's just like they get all of them.

767
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,530
You know what's interesting,
it's when you think about like men and 

768
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,750
women,
like in a straight culture like straight

769
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:31,751
men and straight women.
I wonder if there's more violence with 

770
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:36,251
straight men and straight women than 
there are with gay men like gay 

771
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:39,341
community.
So I wonder if it's like poor capita of 

772
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:40,980
the gay communities have less violence.
That'll be really fascinating to me.

773
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,280
There was more males together and less 
violence versus males and females 

774
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:51,741
together.
I feel like there's two effects 

775
00:35:51,741 --> 00:35:51,741
happening simultaneously.
Like it,

776
00:35:51,741 --> 00:35:56,290
it could make it go down or up because 
it's like you're always drained balls 

777
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,601
because gay dudes,
gay dudes are constantly going around 

778
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:00,600
and say no,
the blow job,

779
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,690
car ride had know and then.
But then the flip side is you're 

780
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:09,441
doubling the amount of testosterone and 
crazy and like if you get into a fight 

781
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:13,050
with your partner and there's nothing 
saying like,

782
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,110
but you can't hit women,
you know,

783
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,200
beat the fuck out of each other.

784
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,760
It's real bad.
Totally.

785
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:22,761
Dudes in a backyard brawl after they 
butt fucked and then start fucking 

786
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:24,210
during the fight.
They just get hot.

787
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,890
Yeah.
Oh you bitch.

788
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,700
And luckily he gave me a plaque.
I pitch do.

789
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,780
I bet lesbians don't fight much.
Hm.

790
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,350
That's a good.
That seems like a sexist thing to say.

791
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:35,160
Owen.
Benjamin.

792
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,470
Yeah.
I can't wait to call you out.

793
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,960
I love it.
I love you and go that route because 

794
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,871
that it's so quick.
It's so sexist and then you've made a 

795
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,350
good point and you're clearly not 
hateful and then they're just like.

796
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,540
So like,
what do we do now?

797
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,360
It's like the kid stay mad when you're 
like,

798
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:56,750
no,
you double men and then you're going to 

799
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:56,750
get dudes who love working out and like,
you know,

800
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,770
real estate.
I wonder if that's the case though.

801
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,240
I wonder because I just guessed about 
the statistics.

802
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,280
What do you think they would be?
Let's look them up,

803
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:07,020
but before we do that,
what do you think it would be?

804
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,270
Do you think there'd be less violence in
the gay community?

805
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,630
I think there would.
That's my guess as far as domestic 

806
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,200
violence partner violence in general.
Violence committed to it.

807
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:21,201
I'm going to say less violence.
I'm gonna say less violence,

808
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:22,170
less violence.

809
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,620
Jamie,
what if we got.

810
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm trying to find it.
All I've found so far,

811
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,120
most of it was about hate crimes,
so digging.

812
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,600
That's the problem because they get 
victimized by people outside of their 

813
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,960
community.
I found one that says is there's a study

814
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:41,961
that suggests that same sex 
relationships suffer higher levels of 

815
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:42,760
domestic violence and heterosexual.
Interesting.

816
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:47,610
That's just like a study.
So was it by like Christian workshops on

817
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:50,190
the BBC reporting it,
but I couldn't.

818
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,210
Oh,
and I'll just violence more common in 

819
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:55,210
same sex relationships.
Yeah.

820
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,180
Well,
you know what does,

821
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,980
I don't know.
It doesn't say how much violence.

822
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,460
Yeah.

823
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,250
I feel like they have more in common.
Like less arguing.

824
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:04,080
Right?
It's like maybe not though.

825
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,560
Domestic violence is a weird word,
right?

826
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,630
It's like it's extra creepy violence 
because violence against someone.

827
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:14,631
You care about your,
your near them and you lose your temper 

828
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:16,740
to the point where you're enacting 
violence on someone,

829
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:20,490
at least at one point your life.
You probably loved right now.

830
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,470
Right now.
You want to get violent with them,

831
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:24,660
like physically violent.
So dangerous.

832
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,210
I'm actually being a cop walking into 
that shit.

833
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,300
I can't imagine.
Especially when you can arrest the guy 

834
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:32,300
and like,
you're like,

835
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,980
this chick's gonna die eventually got 
some heavy,

836
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,760
heavy shit.
Fuck

837
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,040
cuts.
Another reason why I think it's so like,

838
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,660
it's such worse violence because you 
always.

839
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,180
In my head I'm like,
it's a dude beating a woman,

840
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,500
you know?
Yeah.

841
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,290
Even though the other way does happen,
but you just don't really.

842
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,950
I don't know.

843
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,150
I don't know,
man.

844
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:52,550
It's all fucked up.
It's like just the,

845
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:55,700
the fact that people can fall apart so 
bad.

846
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,870
They get to the point where at one point
in time they love this person.

847
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,210
This person was probably like super 
important to them.

848
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,970
Yeah.
And now you want to kill them.

849
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,160
You want to stab them.
You want to beat them up.

850
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:08,810
You want to hit them in the head with 
something like,

851
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,850
woof,
woof,

852
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,070
you're off the tracks.
Yeah,

853
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:15,240
because kind comes from the word can,
like you're supposed to love your can.

854
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:16,850
You know that word comes from kind.
Yeah.

855
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,720
Ken?
Yeah.

856
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:19,870
Hmm.

857
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,470
That makes sense.
Yeah.

858
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,020
You treat kinfolk.
Kinfolk.

859
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:25,550
Yeah.
Fuck.

860
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:28,200
Did kind bud come from kind of bud?
Yeah.

861
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,940
That was always like the weird hippie 
thing.

862
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:35,210
Like that was one of the sure fire ways 
where you didn't want to get high with 

863
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:35,880
somebody if they offered you some kind 
bud.

864
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,240
Hey Man.
Fucking listen bro.

865
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:44,241
We're going to have a conversation about
astrology that I really can have right 

866
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:47,481
now.
It is a red flag to it and astrology 

867
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:52,131
Combo.
I'm fucking tired and I don't want your 

868
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:55,071
nonsense.
I don't want to hear about your 

869
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,430
channeler.
I don't want to hear about your 

870
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,430
spiritual advisor.
No,

871
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,040
no,
no.

872
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,450
Yeah,
kind is nonsense.

873
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:04,070
Talk.
Do a door opener kind bud kind of bud.

874
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,530
That's so funny.
It's kind bud.

875
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,360
Man.
We had good weed and not good.

876
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:11,310
We'd like is okay.
It's pretty good.

877
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,660
It's mid grade.
Mid Grade.

878
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,540
If you were lucky you would say these 
are meds,

879
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,800
meds,
meds,

880
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,370
and we just had weird.
Yeah,

881
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:23,371
and you just like from like 1997 on.
It's just been space we'd.

882
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,360
It's not even the same,
it's not even the same thing.

883
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,970
Everybody denies that.
It's crazy.

884
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,630
From the moment I started smoking weed,
it's been space.

885
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,960
We'd like to start def death experience.
I have with Joey Diaz.

886
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:39,450
Was it about that that that felt like 
mushrooms,

887
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,870
like it felt closer to mushrooms and it 
did weed in my mind.

888
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,610
I explained it in the poly short 
podcast.

889
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,650
I explained too much,
but I'll explain it one more time.

890
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:52,250
When he eat marijuana,
it's processed by your liver and it 

891
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,891
produces something called 11 hydroxy 
metabolite and it's way more like four 

892
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:57,600
to five times more psychoactive than thc
and it does.

893
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:00,240
It's a totally different feel like it 
feels like a cycle,

894
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,230
like a psychedelic drug.

895
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,330
Yeah,
like a really potent one to like.

896
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:06,990
Especially if you go super deep.
It gets really weird,

897
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:08,850
especially when you lie down with your 
eyes closed.

898
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,190
If you get like that and you're really 
freaking out,

899
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,430
one thing that can kind of bring you out
of it that you can see if you can enjoy 

900
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,431
this,
go somewhere dark and close your eyes 

901
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:20,160
and like if you're really freaking out 
on weed,

902
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:23,430
I bet there is a light show for you to 
watch.

903
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Like it'll be like for me,
one of the things that I remember like 

904
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,570
consistently I would see neon cartoons 
having sex like neon old school,

905
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,360
goofy old school,
Mickey mouse cartoons with.

906
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:42,361
They're moving weird but there were made
out of neon and they were having sex 

907
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:42,800
with each other and creating more and 
they were like,

908
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:46,040
like a like branching off like a,
some sort of a fractal.

909
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,400
It was fucking crazy.
Neon sex fractal has to be the name of 

910
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,540
your next.
It was psyched.

911
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,660
I was seeing it all in front of me and 
three d too,

912
00:41:54,661 --> 00:41:57,780
like I was on some Disney ride.
It was happening all around me was.

913
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,600
I was like,
this is crazy.

914
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:04,601
This is just a weed.
And it's crazy when you make the jump 

915
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:05,600
where you realize someone's showing you 
something versus you imagining something

916
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,070
where you're like,
oh,

917
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,300
I'm just watching something else versus 
like picture a helicopter.

918
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,950
There it is.
But it's just like,

919
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:14,930
Holy Shit,
this is something I've never seen before

920
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,430
and I don't know who's showing it to me.

921
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Yeah,
there's something going on and to deny 

922
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,290
it is really interesting because it's.
I think it's another one of those things

923
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,120
much like.
But people want to talk about.

924
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,190
I know for a fact something was a 
conspiracy.

925
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,490
They also want to say I know for a fact 
that this is a hallucination and that's 

926
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:39,131
all it is.
I know for a fact that this is just 

927
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:41,450
chemicals interacting with your mind,
but your whole life is chemicals.

928
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:47,020
You mean?
Your mind is like constantly processing 

929
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,571
different chemicals,
whether it's adrenaline or whatever it 

930
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:52,541
is with different emotions.
There's a lot of different things going 

931
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:55,001
on chemically in your body all the time.
And then there's the big one which is 

932
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:59,111
when your eyes shut and you go to sleep 
and then you imagine a bunch of shit 

933
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,620
happening.
It's not really happening.

934
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,720
Yeah,
like whole civilizations have been built

935
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:04,610
on like the reverence for what you're 
talking about,

936
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,570
so it's not like there's definitely 
something going on there easily.

937
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:13,580
Could be something going on.
There could be different frequencies 

938
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,050
than our normal biology is tuned into a 
very specific frequency and when 

939
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:21,671
something's off,
it could be that they're not picking it 

940
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:24,791
up.
Like maybe that's one of the things 

941
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:24,791
about schizophrenia,
right?

942
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:24,791
They have these issues with their brain 
chemistry.

943
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,930
Maybe they're tuning into a totally 
different world at us.

944
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,240
Maybe their world is like the fucking 
dark city.

945
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,890
Remember that movie with Kiefer 
Sutherland upside down?

946
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,580
Yeah.
Everything is fucking hell.

947
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,590
Everybody's got like four foot long 
fingers and they fucking creeping around

948
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:41,591
corners.
Maybe in their world everything's 

949
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:41,640
completely fucked because they're tuned 
in with their,

950
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:46,641
their own brain chemistry.
Literally they're interacting with the 

951
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:49,571
universe around them.
It's such a different way that like 

952
00:43:49,571 --> 00:43:51,620
their world is dark and scary and ugly 
and twisted.

953
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,040
It's like a filter.
Like when I learned about dark matter,

954
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,100
like I said,
I lost all Hubris that I know anything 

955
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,100
like that.
Seventy percent of the universe.

956
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:05,100
It is this thing that we can't see or 
feel or measure anywhere and we have no 

957
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,680
idea what it is.
I was like,

958
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,920
y'all don't fucking know about tower 
seven men.

959
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,100
That too.
Good way to describe it.

960
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,910
There was something really recently 
about dark matter where they were saying

961
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:20,960
that they think that dark matter is 
stored inside black holes.

962
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,790
Saving even find that so what the fuck 
is a black hole to even get that?

963
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,130
That one's.
That one's a mind bender.

964
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:29,960
Like what?
What's happening out there?

965
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,280
There's some infinitely

966
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,090
dense point and everything is getting 
sucked into it and it's eating it,

967
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,290
but it's eating planets.
Yeah.

968
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,070
What the fuck did you just say?
And it's instant,

969
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:43,170
but to the thing.
It's aternity.

970
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,090
Yeah.
Wait a minute,

971
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,100
wait a minute.
So there's something out there that's 

972
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,100
eating planets.
Does dark matter,

973
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,200
is dark matter less lumpy than 
predicted?

974
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,900
Oh,
that sounds racial.

975
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,950
It could be racial or at least gender 
specific.

976
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:03,840
That's not gender specific.
If dark matter was a person,

977
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:08,670
what Pronoun would it use?
A man that's an intense one.

978
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,810
Zero.
Zero.

979
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:10,900
Zero.
Sorry,

980
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,590
say it,
but you can say zero to.

981
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,250
You can say whatever you want.
It's just made up.

982
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,500
I mean there's going to be a rule around
how to say it,

983
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,070
but see that.
Yeah.

984
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,740
It's like when it comes to gender stuff.
See that's when I stopped.

985
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,050
That's when I have a little bit of an 
opinion where I'm like,

986
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:26,400
there are men and there are women.

987
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:28,050
Yeah.
But there's also a spectrum,

988
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:33,051
right?
I mean there's women that want to fight 

989
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:34,521
in MMA and they want to race cars and 
then there's men who want to be 

990
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:36,140
florists.
Yeah.

991
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,640
But I feel like that's gender role 
spectrum.

992
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:41,940
Like my dad is like a really flamboyant 
opera singing,

993
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,420
like he's real fruity and my mom is like
six foot loves sports,

994
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:49,710
sweatpants,
crushes.

995
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:55,220
And it's like.
But my mom is such a great woman and my 

996
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:55,220
dad's such a great dad.
And that's why sometimes,

997
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,200
you know,
at my piano teacher got a sex change 

998
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,200
when I was 11.
So I,

999
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,040
I've been thinking about this stuff for 
quite some time where I got to see the 

1000
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,610
same person on different hormones as my,
you know,

1001
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:08,220
and I'm a classical piano player.
This is one of the most important people

1002
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:12,120
in my life I'm still friends with and 
it's like to see like it,

1003
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,560
you know,
transition.

1004
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,690
You're like,
oh dudes are way different.

1005
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,290
Just the way the behavior change.
Oh yeah,

1006
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,940
totally.
When it comes to like,

1007
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:24,470
you know,
I'm just like,

1008
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,350
what you're focusing on your level of 
patience when he transitioned to a.

1009
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,980
she,
she,

1010
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:33,981
yeah,
and I know on Halloween and I was like 

1011
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:37,600
trying to work on a,
on Halloween while I was trying to work 

1012
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,861
out a bit about that.
It's like the best time to like make 

1013
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:42,231
that hard turn because people think it's
a costume and then by Thanksgiving 

1014
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:43,380
everyone's like,
oh this is real.

1015
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,270
Oh No.
Yeah.

1016
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,690
Like if someone like Steve O did it 
right,

1017
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:49,530
you'd be like,
look,

1018
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,150
this is,
I know what you're doing.

1019
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,580
You're not getting me with this.
This is a scam.

1020
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,950
It would take forever.
He would not be accepted.

1021
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:58,980
It would take like months before people 
knew it wasn't just a gag.

1022
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,850
They're like,
yeah,

1023
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:02,190
it's a five year gag,
like Tom Green.

1024
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,510
That seems like something Tom Green 
could almost get away with people like,

1025
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:07,220
no,
God dammit.

1026
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,070
We're seeing the Tom Green show 20 
times.

1027
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:15,170
Yeah.
It's like a bucket with the boys with 

1028
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:15,170
the impractical jokers and I'm always 
wondering like if,

1029
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,780
if one of them like really needs help 
and public like,

1030
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,680
is everyone going to be like,
it's sal.

1031
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,000
It's a good point,
you know,

1032
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,990
because people will assume you're doing 
a joke and you're like,

1033
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:26,370
no,
but I'm not joking.

1034
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,590
That's a real good point because if you 
choke on often.

1035
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,210
Oh Shit,
dude.

1036
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,110
That's a fucking good point.
Wow.

1037
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,660
It's like a movie man.
Well,

1038
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,690
it's a plot for a movie dude.
No way,

1039
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,080
Bro.
So right now I was like,

1040
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,230
this could be like a,
a big film man.

1041
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:49,231
I'm feeling it,
but I think it's going to change the 

1042
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:50,990
world.
Practical joker goes out and has a life 

1043
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:55,111
threatening illness and then doesn't get
rescued because that realizes that 

1044
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:59,050
practical jokes are wrong.
That's the moral Mazarra yeah.

1045
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:01,900
What else is there?
I'm Ashton Kutcher.

1046
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,550
You've got to have the cool black 
friend.

1047
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:08,830
Of course,
practical joker has the cool black 

1048
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:08,830
friend.
She keeps it real,

1049
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,150
but it's relatable.
She should have a gay neighbor or no,

1050
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,320
I think everyone has to be gay.
Something has to happen right now.

1051
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,210
They all have a gay dick once,
like every year,

1052
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:20,110
like memory.
We're talking about.

1053
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:25,111
You get the new Dick,
you get a new one every now and that 

1054
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:25,111
every eight.

1055
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:25,980
Dick's is gay.
Who see you see?

1056
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,400
You know about the community.
Oh,

1057
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,110
like every eight.
Once you count them off,

1058
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,390
like a very specific number.
Yeah.

1059
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,370
Magic people like did do that.
And then you came back gay this year.

1060
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,530
Damn.
This year came back gay bro.

1061
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,290
It's my first time.
He was trade all 30 years.

1062
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,630
You have all 30 years.
That's crazy.

1063
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:45,070
That's a good run.
It's a good run.

1064
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,570
So I'm looking forward to getting 
ripped.

1065
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,460
I'm just hoping it's a seasonal thing.
You know,

1066
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:51,550
my uncle was gay for a year.
He had three gay Dixon road.

1067
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:52,500
He lost his wife,
Bro.

1068
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,770
It's not phone man.

1069
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,480
My first grade duke.
Where would that be?

1070
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,420
That we would have a whole different 
attitude?

1071
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,700
God Damn all these,
uh,

1072
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:08,730
all these bigots that have problem with 
gay people know that that wouldn't 

1073
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:08,730
exist.
That's like get.

1074
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,830
Dale has to go away for a year.
He's got rollerskate time.

1075
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,110
He'll come back and be hateful again.
You know,

1076
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:15,840
there'll be kids in school,
Bro.

1077
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:21,030
Let me tell you something.
No one in my family's ever got a gay 

1078
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,030
dude.
I'm not getting the gate deck,

1079
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,320
Bro.
It's like the guy who was like losing a 

1080
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:25,320
little bit of heroin.
He's in high school.

1081
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,230
Listen to me Bro.
My fucking hair is fine.

1082
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:31,231
Yeah.
No one in my family's ever lost her 

1083
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:31,231
hair.
Overcompensate guy.

1084
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:33,690
There's no gate dicks in my blood line.
Dude.

1085
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,260
It's all straight guys.
Listen,

1086
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:37,600
no one in my family is a serial killer.
Okay.

1087
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:40,610
Then you start revealing shit about 
yourself.

1088
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,140
Like whatever you're insecure about you 
like secretly are woo.

1089
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,140
Woo.
Damn is deep.

1090
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,620
Well sometimes I feel like I'll find 
myself hating on a group of people and 

1091
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:52,630
I'm like,
I'm like,

1092
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,030
something about me is that or else I 
wouldn't,

1093
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,500
you know,
like hipsters.

1094
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:57,850
I remember I always,
I always hated him.

1095
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:02,851
I called him indoor cats and uh,
and then I realized that hating hipster 

1096
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:05,380
itself is a hipster move.
Oh,

1097
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:06,220
totally.
I'm like,

1098
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:06,670
no,
dude.

1099
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,470
I was like that before hipsters.
And I'm like,

1100
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:13,471
holy fuck.
A hipster would say that I could have 

1101
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:13,471
easily been a hipster if they caught me.
I like,

1102
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:14,800
I could've been assigned technology if I
didn't know better.

1103
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,480
You know what I mean?
I just would have walked into the wrong 

1104
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,531
door,
took one of them personality tests and 

1105
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:22,531
go,
man,

1106
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:22,531
maybe get my shit together with these 
people.

1107
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:27,340
Yeah.
Maybe I could be on one of these crazy 

1108
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:27,340
wacky levels.
It's the same thing.

1109
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,550
I couldn't be a hipster.
I've got to have a weird mustache.

1110
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,960
Twisty mustache.
Yeah.

1111
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:32,240
It's like what Jordan peers and talks 
about the shadow self.

1112
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,630
I can be like really into micro beers.
Yeah.

1113
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:38,000
I could live out my life in 18,
20 in Austin,

1114
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:38,420
Texas.

1115
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,180
I can wear really tight jeans and tell 
everyone I'm a photographer because I 

1116
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:46,180
have an instagram account.
$300.

1117
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,090
Yeah.
And they all have those,

1118
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,120
those shoes.
Do you know those uncomfortable looking 

1119
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,310
like Italian looking shoes?
Yeah,

1120
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,190
Dave Lewis makes.
It's like,

1121
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,840
hey,
they go to like a cobbler,

1122
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,450
hipster cobbler,
but there's something kind of cool about

1123
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:06,470
it too.
I know.

1124
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,560
Like those shoes right there.
Those are totally hipster shoes.

1125
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,590
Jamie.
You nailed it.

1126
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,010
You goddamn nailed it.
That's the perfect shoe for hipster.

1127
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,730
Yeah,
low.

1128
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,790
Think low cut one would be like a little
bit more hipstery.

1129
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,170
Maybe.
Maybe I'm wrong.

1130
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,550
Oh,
that's a hipster shoe.

1131
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:21,980
If I've ever seen one.
Good Lord.

1132
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:24,440
I'm too hard.
Turns in my life away from wearing those

1133
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:29,441
shoes right now.
That's really called a hipster to John 

1134
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:31,010
Varvatos.
Star USA.

1135
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,020
Hipster Chucka.
Boom,

1136
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,070
Chucka.
Boom.

1137
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,860
I didn't even know that.
That was a thing until now.

1138
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,630
Chukka boots.
What's a chuck of boot?

1139
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,850
Isn't it weird when you see two k's next
to each other?

1140
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,070
Like makes you think it's racist?
Totally.

1141
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:44,900
It is.
Now you can't do that anymore.

1142
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,820
This should change this immediately.
I'm triggered.

1143
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,950
I'm so triggered.
Everybody should be

1144
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,570
the got real problems in this country.
It's not a joke anymore.

1145
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:57,890
Yeah.
That charlottesville thing that just 

1146
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,690
showed everybody when you saw those guys
walking down the street with those 

1147
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:01,540
Citronella,
home depot torches,

1148
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,930
I was like,
this is the craziest fucking thing I've 

1149
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:07,180
ever seen in my life.
Screaming white lives matter.

1150
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,410
Crazy.
Like,

1151
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,480
you know who said it best?
Man,

1152
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:14,650
I have a great quote.
Sturgill Simpson sent me this.

1153
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,610
Um,
because uh,

1154
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:21,400
he had an email exchange with Dr Rick 
Strassman,

1155
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:26,040
who's the guy that wrote a dmt the 
spirit molecule and uh,

1156
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,490
they had an email exchange.
He said,

1157
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:32,491
for starters,
I would say this is Rick strassman 

1158
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:35,431
saying this,
that what we're seeing is a failure of 

1159
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:37,801
the educational system.
This is due to faults within the system 

1160
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:41,470
itself as well as attacks on the system.
That system from outside,

1161
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:46,471
by forces and institutions that gained 
to benefit from ignorance and addiction.

1162
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Both religious faith and the love of 
community have degenerated into crude 

1163
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,980
parodies of what they're capable of 
being regarding where this is all 

1164
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:58,980
heading.
He says,

1165
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,330
my zen teacher used to say that the 
force of good,

1166
00:53:01,331 --> 00:53:03,190
this is what we thought was really 
interesting.

1167
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:06,310
The forces of good relative to the 
forces of evil,

1168
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,400
evil are always around 50 point one 
percent versus 49 point nine percent.

1169
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,120
There's a similar notion in Judaism 
along these lines that the future of the

1170
00:53:18,611 --> 00:53:23,611
world depends upon single individual's 
actions and I think it says something 

1171
00:53:23,611 --> 00:53:28,531
like paradoxical,
like we are a speck of dust and the fate

1172
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,400
of the universe hinges on us.
Wow.

1173
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,380
That that quote right there,
we are a speck of dust and in in quotes,

1174
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,260
the fate of the universe hinges on us.
That when I read that today,

1175
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,490
I was like,
Holy Shit.

1176
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,930
Like that's so true.

1177
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,760
Yeah,
and when you see this right now,

1178
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:50,580
like what's going on with 
Charlottesville and what's going on with

1179
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:56,180
the way trump is reacting to it all and 
the way people reacted to it all and 

1180
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,801
people are digging in their heels and 
form and signs and this is any group,

1181
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:06,470
any group that wouldn't think that this 
is completely insane and totally out of 

1182
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:12,651
control in any group of people that 
wouldn't think that someone driving a 

1183
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:16,260
car into a group of protest or just 
randomly running over a girl.

1184
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:21,261
Any group that wouldn't denounce that 
instantaneously as one of those heinous 

1185
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:24,150
things ever.
This is exactly what we're terrified of,

1186
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:27,030
what we see happening in Paris and in 
other parts of the world.

1187
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:32,031
And here we have an American doing it.
And our differentiation is not even 

1188
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:32,770
that,
you know,

1189
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:37,810
we're,
we're being attacked the way we're 

1190
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,521
looking at it in terms of its white 
people and white nationalists versus 

1191
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,270
empty,
right?

1192
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,760
We're not even looking at it like we're 
all Americans.

1193
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,950
We're not even looking at it like we're 
all on the same team.

1194
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,730
We're,
we're,

1195
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:48,600
we're,
we're,

1196
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:53,601
we're literally homegrown terrorism.
That's a homegrown terrorist activity.

1197
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,810
Yeah.
One hundred percent,

1198
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,760
100 percent.
I mean,

1199
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:58,170
so you worried about al Qaeda,
you're worried about isis,

1200
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:03,171
you're worried about the Taliban.
You've got something right here that is 

1201
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:07,011
willing to drive a car into a random 
group of people that look just like him,

1202
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,290
a bunch of white people.
I mean,

1203
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:13,260
this is,
this is completely fucking insane.

1204
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,440
And the craziest part is they're not 
doing it to overthrow like the yolk of 

1205
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:18,440
empire.
It's not like,

1206
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:18,710
like,
you know,

1207
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:19,340
the,
uh,

1208
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,170
Ireland back in the seventies with 
British control,

1209
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:23,730
like at least you can kind of be like,
oh,

1210
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:28,731
they don't want to be controlled by the.
So these people are literally living in 

1211
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:28,731
the most free country.

1212
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:33,580
You know,
they're prosperous to the point of 

1213
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,051
almost boredom where they start.
And I don't think Antifa realizes how 

1214
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:38,910
much similarity they have to the people 
they claim to be fighting against.

1215
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,980
It's a natural progression to have 
extremely violent protests like these 

1216
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,090
people happen.
Everybody ramps it up,

1217
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,090
they ramp it up in the left,
they ramp it up in the right,

1218
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,340
everybody gets angry in this fucking 
asshole drives into a bunch of people.

1219
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,890
Fuck man,
it's fucking awful.

1220
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,500
And then trump said,
here's the thing.

1221
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,500
All this happened because we were taking
down the statue of Robert e Dot Lee,

1222
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,770
who's the leader of the confederates,
right?

1223
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,320
Trump literally say said today,
what's next?

1224
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:06,840
Are we going to take down a statue of 
George Washington?

1225
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:09,590
It's like,
what?

1226
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,480
It's a bit of a false equivalency of 
what?

1227
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:16,430
How the fuck can you even say that?
That this is.

1228
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,040
He's got some weird thing going on,
were asked to dance around his support 

1229
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,980
for white supremacists or white 
nationalist.

1230
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:29,220
He has to dance around it,
which is weird because they're not that 

1231
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,290
big of a group like it's not like.
But if they're on your side,

1232
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,650
they're all on your side.
10,000

1233
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:38,260
people and it might be a lot more than 
you think.

1234
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:41,170
Man might be a lot of closet racists out
there.

1235
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,120
I see so much similarities between like,
you know,

1236
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,580
white racist and then like the social 
justice racists or it's like it's just,

1237
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,640
it's usually like the white Nazis or 
like the losers trying to get something 

1238
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,320
out of their skin and then social 
justice worries.

1239
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,230
A lot of times they're trying to get 
something out of an oppressed,

1240
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,170
being an unoppressed status in both of 
those groups.

1241
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:01,390
I'm like,
you're both trying to avoid merit,

1242
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,760
merit.
Like you're just trying to get something

1243
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:08,761
from your stupid group because he never 
see like a Nazi is like good looking,

1244
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:10,030
are successful.

1245
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,580
They're always just like,
I deserve some shit because I'm white.

1246
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,370
And you're like,
then that means you're weak as fuck.

1247
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,940
I think it was,
I just think it's just a massive failure

1248
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:23,941
from the beginning to now of thinking a 
similar thing that makes sense to me.

1249
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,710
Yeah,
and just like the agenda,

1250
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:31,711
thank where it's like you start ignoring
basic reality to get clicks or you know,

1251
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,650
outrage culture as well.
It's just the.

1252
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,250
It's just not the way to go.
You did see matt just joined up with all

1253
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:41,410
white people like that.
It's just insane.

1254
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,610
It's completely insane and even the 
concept of white is a new concept,

1255
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:46,600
but growing up it's like,
oh,

1256
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:51,601
you're Irish or Italian,
or it's like one of this fucking 

1257
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:51,601
federation kickoff.
Well,

1258
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,220
we've been forced in this position by a 
thing called white privilege.

1259
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,220
I don't know if you're aware of it.
I checked it on my way on check yourself

1260
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,420
before you wreck yourself.

1261
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:03,160
Yeah.
Well that's the thing is we're all human

1262
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:05,920
beings who migrated from Africa.
That's a fact.

1263
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,690
I go back far enough,
but we don't.

1264
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:09,810
We're not willing to go back farther.
We're like,

1265
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:14,820
we're stopping wherever the fuck.
I know we've got this accident from a 

1266
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,350
dcs my homeland and defendant defendant 
acted in my deaf.

1267
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,280
That guy's just that color because it 
never fucking.

1268
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,380
It's always.
It's always cloudy.

1269
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,200
You have vitamin ever stops raining.
It's literally it.

1270
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,760
Exactly.
That's why they're so pale.

1271
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:28,690
They're trying to suck as much of the 
Vitamin d out of the sky as they can.

1272
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:33,740
Yeah,
cause like two percent couldn't get 

1273
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,971
pussy because they died.
They died and that's how vitamin D and 

1274
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:36,100
that's an evolution works.
They turn it into paper.

1275
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:40,210
Those people to just did little goddamn 
solar panels just walking around,

1276
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:43,690
sucking in.
The vitamin D take it is.

1277
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:48,830
They're all Africans.
Irish people are Africans that just 

1278
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,630
stayed in Ireland.
Yes.

1279
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:54,660
That's what we all are.
It's just like a flash when we started 

1280
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,260
separating and it really has nothing to 
do with who we are as people.

1281
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:57,520
I can see the criticism.
Oh,

1282
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,100
you're one of those bro.
I don't see color people.

1283
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,500
Those people.
I don't even see color pro.

1284
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,940
Maybe be like,
no,

1285
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,230
I,
I am racist,

1286
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:10,231
but listen,
I don't want you in my store but I know 

1287
00:59:10,231 --> 00:59:14,611
are equal except with the gay rainbow.
Yeah.

1288
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:18,220
Just so I'm not in the raiders fans or 
you know,

1289
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,450
a Chinese food shoppers.
Yeah.

1290
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:25,530
Like I used to do a song where it's like
black dudes with more than one pit bull 

1291
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,030
scare the shit out of me.
But a black guy with a cell phone on his

1292
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:27,580
belt I trust.
Oh,

1293
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,760
that's hilarious.
I would do it.

1294
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,760
I would have the crowd.
He works at Verizon because it's all 

1295
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,480
cultural signifiers and so I would have 
the crowd yell out anybody,

1296
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:40,481
you know,
white people like white dudes with tear 

1297
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:40,481
drop tattoos in Idaho,
scared,

1298
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:44,010
you know,
and you just go through any race and 

1299
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:44,010
you're like,
look,

1300
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:47,350
it's always,
it's that Chris Rock joke that I won't 

1301
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:47,720
repeat because of my,
my privileged,

1302
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,080
but like there's this group and then 
there's this Chris and everybody knows 

1303
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:53,080
which one are the dickheads in which 
one,

1304
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,870
not even dickheads,
but from a position of like desperation.

1305
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,910
Yeah.
Depending on where you are in history.

1306
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:02,240
If I walk by too many dudes that have 
their pants sagging,

1307
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,110
so like more than two of them are,
oh,

1308
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,710
these guys must make stupid decisions.
Yeah.

1309
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,680
Bad decision guys.
If you got like your,

1310
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:12,590
your pants,
like down to like duck curve,

1311
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:14,630
the downward curve or your ass.

1312
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,680
Right?
It's riding the curve and I could see 

1313
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:19,680
like a giant percentage of your 
underwear.

1314
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,430
Yeah.
One guy may have forgot about two guys.

1315
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:24,560
They're heightened guns.
Just not even that.

1316
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:27,290
It's just they're just making stupid 
decisions with their life.

1317
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:32,650
Sure.
My brother judges people based on if 

1318
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:32,780
they back into their spot or not.
Oh.

1319
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:35,180
If they can know.
My brother's like that got in back end,

1320
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,140
doesn't give a shit about his family and
he'll make fucking jumped.

1321
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,290
He's like,
oh,

1322
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,450
so are then.
And if someone needs them,

1323
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,970
I just back in in case of emergencies.
He's like,

1324
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,410
that is a good move.
Actually.

1325
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,660
He's right.
But like it's just intensity,

1326
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:49,460
like judge people on that.
Yeah.

1327
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:51,920
But like I'm,
I'm getting out.

1328
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:55,210
If I can back out,
like I'll still get it.

1329
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,200
Like how much of an advantage I'd like 
to see,

1330
01:00:57,201 --> 01:01:02,201
like a test that shows how much,
how much of an advantage you have in a 

1331
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,130
dangerous situation and a half second.

1332
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,010
Like was he being attacked by like a 
pterodactyl look at?

1333
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,320
Probably a whole second.
Let me think back.

1334
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:11,270
And then you take off.
He'd probably have like a good solid two

1335
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:13,100
or three seconds probably.
Yeah,

1336
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,810
that could save is.
Yeah.

1337
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:17,720
You know,
why you might be able to make a light or

1338
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:18,310
you know,
like,

1339
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:23,560
yeah,
my below figure out like someone's 

1340
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:23,570
falling off a cliff and was just like,
that's like two seconds.

1341
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,150
Yeah.
But I guess it,

1342
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,890
yeah,
if you're in a dangerous situation,

1343
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,250
then the real question is like,
how dangerous are we talking?

1344
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:36,430
Do you have to decide like,
do you want to be one of those people 

1345
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:40,570
that survives nuclear holocaust or do 
you want to be one of those people that 

1346
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:44,510
dies?
And the initial blast alone death,

1347
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,630
uh,
with my friends and family,

1348
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,780
Po,
po survive if I was alone.

1349
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:52,010
Like if it was that,
that like,

1350
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:52,460
uh,
the,

1351
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:53,510
the road,
that book.

1352
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,710
Yeah.
I didn't want,

1353
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:59,711
I didn't read that book,
but I watched a little bit of the movie 

1354
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:01,751
up until he was teaching.
His son were to shoot himself in the 

1355
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:01,751
mouth to kill himself and.
Yeah,

1356
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:02,060
and I was like,
check please.

1357
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,020
That's in high stake.
Shit.

1358
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,500
I'm good.
Yeah,

1359
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,960
I would've.
I would've went out with the blast.

1360
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,730
It just seems like you don't want to 
cannibalize.

1361
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,250
You just don't stay alive.
You really don't.

1362
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,780
You just don't know.
You don't.

1363
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,600
You don't want to have to worry about 
people eating.

1364
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,500
You either feel.
I'm scared of the owls.

1365
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:25,970
Like right now.
Imagine if you're constantly under 

1366
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:25,970
threat of someone's stealing everything 
that you have.

1367
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,270
Constantly.
Constant.

1368
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,770
Yeah.
You're up in the middle of the night.

1369
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,250
Check cocked and ready to rock looking 
out the window.

1370
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,720
Always worried about invaders that might
eat you.

1371
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:41,570
I lost a bunch of chickens to raccoon 
and a Fox recently and it dawned on me 

1372
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:44,520
that stakes of life where I'm like,
if I needed those eggs,

1373
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:47,130
like I'm fucking dead.
You killed nine of them in one night.

1374
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,450
Jesus Christ.
And I was like,

1375
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:50,820
one mistake,
one hole in the thing,

1376
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:52,380
and they drink the blood.
Right?

1377
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:53,670
Is that what they do?
The raccoons,

1378
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,260
they bite their neck and drink their 
blood.

1379
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,330
I think so they took the bodies.
They did.

1380
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:02,360
Yeah.
So that's why I think there's a fox 

1381
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:02,360
involved.
Oh No.

1382
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:02,360
Yeah.
Wow.

1383
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,300
There's a whole party going on your 
chicken.

1384
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:08,490
It was crazy.
So we stayed up the next night with air 

1385
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:08,940
rifles and shot a raccoon and a Fox 
because they came back.

1386
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:10,320
Oh,
they did?

1387
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:12,290
It was like a Disney movie.
Goddamn.

1388
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,930
Um,
air rifle.

1389
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:16,990
Huh?
Wilcon.

1390
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:22,490
Uh,
I just want you to get it like ace 

1391
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:22,490
hardware.
Store one.

1392
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:23,220
Yeah.
So did it kill them or just hurt?

1393
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,850
I was just trying to set a tone.
Like I wasn't looking to take them out.

1394
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:28,070
I was looking to do like,
listen,

1395
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,610
don't kill the girls.
Interesting.

1396
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,670
Because.
Because I can't legally shoot a gun in 

1397
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:37,140
my area even though I'm in the country.
Time to go walking dead style son.

1398
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,120
Get yourself across both.
Yeah.

1399
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:41,040
I gotta go,
but I'm not accurate yet.

1400
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah,
that's the problem.

1401
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,580
It takes a long time to learn how to get
accurate with a boat.

1402
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:49,581
I would recommend a crossbow and nice 
rest with a crossbow is basically a 

1403
01:03:49,581 --> 01:03:49,581
shitty gun.

1404
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,560
It's a gun that shoots bolts.
I mean it just doesn't.

1405
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,080
It's not really a bow.
I mean it's.

1406
01:03:55,081 --> 01:04:00,081
You're going to trigger.
All you have to do is squeeze that 

1407
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:02,991
sucker off and put the crosshairs on it 
and they fly really flat and really 

1408
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:07,311
fast.
You can fuck up a Fox with one of those 

1409
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:07,920
if you were so inclined.
I am inclined.

1410
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,140
Well,
Kelly,

1411
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:14,160
your chickens,
you should definitely try to scare it 

1412
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:14,160
off and there's other options too.
They can.

1413
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,801
You can take a urine.
They'll sell like mountain lion urine 

1414
01:04:17,801 --> 01:04:21,861
and even wolf urine testing on it 
doesn't work like vitamins and.

1415
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,570
Oh,
he eats bananas big.

1416
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,810
He's been drunk for a week.
I think he's.

1417
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,890
He's so dehydrated.
He's not gonna do anything.

1418
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:35,910
Yeah.
If you have like a different kinds of 

1419
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,440
animals that get scared off by different
kinds of sense.

1420
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,110
Yeah.
I gotta get a cent.

1421
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,710
We man get some.
Both pis,

1422
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:45,450
they sell the shit they do.
They really sell it,

1423
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,140
they sell all kinds of different animal 
pis to ward off other animals.

1424
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,020
It's really interesting.
Clock Piss.

1425
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,270
Um,
I don't think that works.

1426
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,910
I don't think it works with raptors.
So I think it's more of a mammal thing.

1427
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,300
Raptors piss on stuff.
That'd be interesting if they did.

1428
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,170
I know mammals do.
Dogs and cats piss on shit.

1429
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,110
Mark their ground.
Yeah.

1430
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:11,111
Because it's like birds are like raptors
to use that word just changed my whole 

1431
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,200
opinion out there.
Fucking gangster there.

1432
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:17,410
So there are so predatory there.
So ruthless to.

1433
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,790
Yeah.
I used to work at a dock and I'd feed 

1434
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:23,830
ducks a brad and just watched them 
fucking destroyed job.

1435
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:25,900
Bite each others stealing bread from 
each other.

1436
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:28,990
That's why when a girl does a duck face 
instinctively granted.

1437
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:33,510
Um,
so,

1438
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:38,511
uh,
let's come back to that Google memo 

1439
01:05:38,511 --> 01:05:38,511
thing.
Yeah.

1440
01:05:38,511 --> 01:05:41,630
Because this is one of the weird lines 
in the sand that got cross with this is 

1441
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:42,000
that uh,
everybody,

1442
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,640
I mean everybody established a line in 
the sand I should say.

1443
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,120
And it was like you thought that memo 
was the worst thing you've ever read 

1444
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,501
ever.
And that guy's a massage and a piece of 

1445
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:54,501
shit,
or he said,

1446
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:54,501
well,
yeah,

1447
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:56,530
evolutionary psychology sort of tries to
explain why,

1448
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,970
why people choose certain things and 
like what factors,

1449
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,590
what factors or environmental factors or
hormonal would,

1450
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,720
what factors have to do with being a 
male when have,

1451
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,320
what factors have to do with being a 
female.

1452
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:12,530
And there's like a lot of studies and 
that guy cited a lot of studies and he 

1453
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,780
talked like he.
It was a really interesting thing.

1454
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:20,810
The only thing that I think people could
find derogatory maybe is that he said 

1455
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,910
the women are more neurotic.
Neurotic is sort of a derogatory term,

1456
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,410
right?
I'm actually a derogatory term.

1457
01:06:28,411 --> 01:06:33,411
Right.
It's not neurotic is saying that you're 

1458
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:33,411
not handling something good.
Right.

1459
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:34,790
You're not,
you're not handling whatever

1460
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,270
pressures.
Yeah.

1461
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,950
There's a neurotic.
Right.

1462
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,870
I would be calm because it's implying 
that you,

1463
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,260
the another person handling that same 
situation,

1464
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,440
perhaps even mail that'd be more calm.
Right.

1465
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:50,370
Like the like very aware would be the 
nice way of saying it because I like,

1466
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,250
my wife has a lot of anxiety,
but once we had a baby I was like,

1467
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,280
oh,
this is why because you're responsible 

1468
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:58,280
for this,
like little alien,

1469
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:58,280
it can die.
Totally make sense.

1470
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,340
But the thing that guy said that,
that the car,

1471
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:06,530
like when,
when people would argue with me about 

1472
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:06,530
it,
I'd be like,

1473
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:06,530
so do you think men and women are the 
same?

1474
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,500
And from there I don't care if they're 
an expert,

1475
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:12,600
if they say there is no difference at 
all.

1476
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:17,601
I'm like,
my mom had her phd and quit to raise us 

1477
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,970
as soon as she had her baby and my wife 
stays home with our son was an engineer.

1478
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:25,971
It's like that isn't saying that there 
aren't rockstar female engineers that 

1479
01:07:25,971 --> 01:07:28,740
have no interest in having a child.
All it does is affect the,

1480
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:30,480
uh,
the percentage.

1481
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:35,810
And that's always saying is equality of 
outcome versus a opportunity is really 

1482
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:36,990
the debate.
And I'm very against equality of outcome

1483
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:39,390
because the legal precedent,
that is insane.

1484
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,600
A real issue.
Like you have to find out,

1485
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:44,370
okay,
what is the actual suppression?

1486
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,110
What is stopping people from getting to 
this position that happened?

1487
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:53,130
Be Female?
Is it because they're being suppressed 

1488
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:53,490
along the way?
Is it because the way they interact with

1489
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:56,970
each other is different than the way men
interact with each other and so when men

1490
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:00,960
interact with them,
they get upset by it.

1491
01:08:00,961 --> 01:08:05,961
There's different rules that have to be 
established in these working 

1492
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:08,541
environments.
Is it that they don't want to have 

1493
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:11,841
anything to do with that and they would 
rather not compete in one of those 

1494
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:14,781
hostile male driven environments?
Is that why they choose not to get 

1495
01:08:14,781 --> 01:08:16,310
involved or are they someone stopping 
them?

1496
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,390
If someone's saying,
hey,

1497
01:08:17,391 --> 01:08:19,340
we gotta keep chicks out here.
I don't like checks.

1498
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,910
Like it would completely depend on 
what's actually happening if the ladders

1499
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,730
happening,
but then you got a real issue.

1500
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:30,760
Exactly,
but if the former like the very 

1501
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,070
beginning one,
if they choose different stuff,

1502
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:36,220
ironically it hurts women the most.
Like the very qualified ones with the 

1503
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:36,310
job.
People start looking at him.

1504
01:08:36,311 --> 01:08:41,311
I go because they're women,
even though like programming itself was 

1505
01:08:41,311 --> 01:08:41,930
founded by a chick,
you know,

1506
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,050
but like I don't think that she vented 
Cobol,

1507
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:46,480
right?
Yeah.

1508
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:49,100
Like some of my buddies.
So I was going on that one.

1509
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:54,050
It's called cobol the lovelace.
Oh yeah.

1510
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:59,051
It's like,
it's not discluding and it's not saying 

1511
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:02,291
that women can't do it.
Of course less women are interested in 

1512
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:02,291
doing it.
Yes.

1513
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:06,860
So if you have an equal number of men 
and women,

1514
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,820
then you probably go like artificially 
inflated the number of women.

1515
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:12,270
Yes.
That makes sense.

1516
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:18,100
Unless for some reason women gravitate 
towards that thing and just as higher 

1517
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,690
percentages men do,
which is really odd because not a lot of

1518
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:25,250
things where women gravitate towards it 
with the same percentage of people.

1519
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,330
It's the same like,
like,

1520
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:31,360
like there's,
I'm sure there's a lot of fields of 

1521
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,461
study.
I know particularly nursing and I think 

1522
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,591
a lot of the social studies that women 
gravitate tape towards in higher 

1523
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:35,591
numbers.
Right?

1524
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,250
Like,
like nursing,

1525
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:40,170
healthcare even I think he teaching 
children's,

1526
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,580
I think there's more female physicians 
means that's bullshit.

1527
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:48,610
Maybe I read that from some.
You're like teaching children gravitate 

1528
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:51,920
more to.
There's got to be a ton of different 

1529
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,560
jobs that females like gravitate towards
in higher percentages.

1530
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:59,750
We,
we absolutely shouldn't insist that 

1531
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,340
there's an equal representation of men 
in florists.

1532
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,730
Exactly.
And then you know,

1533
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,260
in,
in interior design.

1534
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,470
My brother's a lumberjack.
We worked,

1535
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:11,950
we worked with one woman worked with us 
one time and she was from Yale and like 

1536
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,560
probably doing a whole thing,
you know,

1537
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,230
like he couldn't,
well I dunno,

1538
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,310
but couldn't climb a tree and like some 
women for sure could,

1539
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:24,270
but if you're going like these dudes go 
up 200 foot trees and,

1540
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,110
and spend all day like chopping them 
down,

1541
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,710
it's like,
that isn't going to drop 50 percent 

1542
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:32,710
women.

1543
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,500
It just isn't.
Here's what's the most hilarious thing 

1544
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,781
about the google memo.
It upset so many women that they had to 

1545
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:41,150
take time off proving the point.
It's so crazy.

1546
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:45,770
They wanted time off so bad that they 
went for it.

1547
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:50,950
They want to play the victim so hard 
that they went for it and not even 

1548
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:54,671
understanding that it proves the point 
of the most skeptical people,

1549
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,860
the most skeptical people on the side of
like,

1550
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,640
I don't know if these chicks are going 
to be able to pull their own weight,

1551
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:05,230
these chicks,
and then immediately they encounter any 

1552
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:05,330
adversity like we need time off from a 
memo.

1553
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:10,331
Handle this from a nice.
Somebody talked about evolutionary 

1554
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:12,920
psychology and I just can't handle it.
I need time away from work.

1555
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,410
I'm being attacked

1556
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,510
because they said it was time for a 
female James Bond.

1557
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,250
Oh,
like I called him.

1558
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:25,050
I called her double o seven,
seven cents on the dollar and one of the

1559
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:26,430
jobs,
Jane Bond,

1560
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:30,450
she's open to hyphenation and then 
whether lies is in need of a big Asian.

1561
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,540
That's so funny.
It's like if you take James,

1562
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,170
you can have a female spy.
It's just going to be different tactics.

1563
01:11:37,171 --> 01:11:40,410
You can't have a male wonder woman.
Okay,

1564
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,790
okay.
We can have a female James Bond.

1565
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:49,890
Make your own fucking detective.
Be James Bond.

1566
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,740
He's a guy and I'm cool with Black 
Santa.

1567
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:58,160
I am too,
because that's because that's I think 

1568
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:58,160
Megan Kelly was out of line.
I do too.

1569
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,090
She was out a lot,
but theoretically why the fuck would he 

1570
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:04,990
be black?
Who was living up in the North Pole?

1571
01:12:04,991 --> 01:12:06,780
It'd be white as shit.
That's the whole point.

1572
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,450
The Irish magic.
There's no god damn sign up there.

1573
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,140
It's freezing cold.
Yeah.

1574
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:16,170
Black gets outside.
There could be black Santa but he would 

1575
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:16,170
die of rickets.
Well,

1576
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,590
I don't think that would be the case,
but I think he would,

1577
01:12:18,591 --> 01:12:23,591
uh,
he would have a real issue getting some 

1578
01:12:23,591 --> 01:12:23,591
vitamin D.
He would,

1579
01:12:23,591 --> 01:12:23,930
he'd have to go get it somewhere.
Maybe some supplements.

1580
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,170
Spine and get all fucked up telling them
elves hooked me up.

1581
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:32,171
Dude.
You know when you're building a little 

1582
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:32,620
toy trains and shit,
they'll be some fucking vitamin D bitch.

1583
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,800
The d,
The dls.

1584
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,440
Use that Christmas magic.
Right?

1585
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,210
Like make Sanderson Vitamin D.
I can't work deep breath.

1586
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,320
Yeah.
And then they always bring,

1587
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:45,500
bring.
They bring blow too because San has got 

1588
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,430
to step for two straight days.
Santa does adderall like crazy.

1589
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:51,800
Rampages listens to techno only house 
music wise.

1590
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:54,940
Manga toys to crunch times like you 
know,

1591
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,100
all through Decembers,
frantic pop adderall.

1592
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,530
Cancel A.
Yeah.

1593
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,160
And then and then like.
And everyone's like,

1594
01:13:01,161 --> 01:13:03,820
why are the presidents alphabetical?
He's like,

1595
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:06,740
fuck,
I got to be off a better go organized.

1596
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,680
He over organized Santa went crazy.
Crazy.

1597
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:15,010
But yeah,
it's like if you say that there has to 

1598
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:17,081
be an equal outcome,
you're going to sacrifice quality of 

1599
01:13:17,081 --> 01:13:17,390
wondered what jobs there would be where 
you have.

1600
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:19,310
If you have 100 men,
100 women,

1601
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:22,880
one,
what jobs would you have to be where you

1602
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:27,881
had an equal number of men in equal 
number of women that are interested in 

1603
01:13:27,881 --> 01:13:29,780
those jobs out of 100.
Like what job would that be?

1604
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:34,400
What do you think would be other than 
like famous,

1605
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:38,720
I want to be famous.
What about high school teacher?

1606
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:45,250
I feel like we're on family feud.
I'll go to the Richard Dawson family 

1607
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:47,750
feud by the way.
No disrespect Steve Harvey.

1608
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:53,420
I remember Steve Dawson.
Saturdays as that guy.

1609
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:58,050
Always kind of like,
grabbed a little drunk.

1610
01:13:58,290 --> 01:13:59,790
Yeah,
he'd like put his hands on people.

1611
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:01,440
You'd be like,
there's only 15 of those.

1612
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:02,790
Hey,
here's the PR guy.

1613
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,880
He was in a fucking Nazi comedy.
He was a god Damn Nazi county.

1614
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:10,700
He was in Hogan's heroes.
Oh yeah,

1615
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,580
that's God.
Damn.

1616
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:17,580
Nazi got less than 30 years after the 
war.

1617
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,180
Right.
It's like,

1618
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:20,680
I love Lucy,
but Auschwitz,

1619
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:21,910
like,
what's that pitch like?

1620
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:27,060
Let's ask the question.
What year do you think Hogan's heroes 

1621
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,331
came out?
I want to say it was in the seventies 

1622
01:14:30,331 --> 01:14:31,330
and the war ended in 47.
Correct.

1623
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,030
When was Hogan's heroes?
Sixty five.

1624
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,650
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit,

1625
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:40,830
dude.
That's less than 20 years after the war 

1626
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,140
was over.
They had a goddamn comedy about the war.

1627
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:46,170
Do you think that's gallows humor,
like it affected so many people that 

1628
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:46,210
they had this impulse to market?
Well,

1629
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:48,640
I think people were tougher back then 
for sure.

1630
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:53,670
They could joke around about shit more.
Hence Archie bunker to be literally 

1631
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:58,591
impossible to have today.
The amount of outrage if someone tried 

1632
01:14:58,591 --> 01:14:59,710
to make an art,
a character like archie bunker.

1633
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,540
Yeah,
good.

1634
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:02,500
Oh,
look at that.

1635
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,490
He was wearing a fucking.

1636
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:06,280
Remember he had to pretend to be a Nazi 
at one point in time snuck in.

1637
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,330
There's a,
there's so much hard today,

1638
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:14,710
so much anger at even racist characters 
in fiction.

1639
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:17,440
If you have a racist character in 
fiction,

1640
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:22,570
people are angry you like there's a 
bunch of young,

1641
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:27,420
what's young fiction like young heart 
and there's a um,

1642
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:32,670
there's a category that they use,
but there's this very popular book and 

1643
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:38,790
it's being attacked by all these social 
justice warriors because of this one 

1644
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:41,740
character that's racist.
And so someone took the,

1645
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:45,790
the racist quotes at this character set 
and took him completely out of context,

1646
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:50,950
out of the context of the book and 
published it in a blog and was saying 

1647
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:55,051
like,
look at this racist bullshit that's in 

1648
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,171
this book.
And then people are getting really mad 

1649
01:15:58,171 --> 01:15:58,180
at the course.
They never read the book,

1650
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,760
read the blog,
which is what people do.

1651
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:04,840
And so they got super fucking mad and 
it,

1652
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,380
it just became this huge thing.
Like,

1653
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:11,460
wait a minute,
you're saying you can't have a monster 

1654
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:11,460
in a book and you have a guy who's a 
murderer?

1655
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,840
Because if we can't do that,
I need to know where the fucking line 

1656
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:15,840
is.
Man Can.

1657
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,501
I can't,
I can't make a book about a serial 

1658
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:19,501
killer.
Oh,

1659
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:19,501
I can.
Okay.

1660
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:20,160
But it can't be racist.
Right?

1661
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:20,950
Oh,
got it.

1662
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:23,530
Okay.
Can I make a book about a guy who brings

1663
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:27,610
people back from the dead and they kill 
a bunch of people and can I do that?

1664
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:28,690
I can.
Okay.

1665
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:33,870
But he can't be racist.
You can't discriminate against Chinese 

1666
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:33,870
people.
Can't discriminate.

1667
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:33,880
I've used the wrong pronoun.
It doesn't matter.

1668
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:37,060
Imagine how fucking stupid you have to 
be that it would just be clock,

1669
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:40,300
which right now be called Dr Jekyll 
like,

1670
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,290
Fred,
if you forget,

1671
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,640
hide,
you don't learn.

1672
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,450
Like,
like,

1673
01:16:43,451 --> 01:16:43,840
like,
um,

1674
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:46,990
my mom was teaching a class once a and 
she was like,

1675
01:16:46,991 --> 01:16:49,900
they took Edward Jim out of huckleberry 
Finn.

1676
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,640
Yeah,
they did get that word out.

1677
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,300
You can't know at time unless you know 
the characters from that time,

1678
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:57,640
you know,
and it's giving people a real disservice

1679
01:16:57,641 --> 01:17:02,560
to just like emasculate and neuter our 
history so that everybody can't see what

1680
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:07,561
real dangers are.
Like what just happened in 

1681
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:09,421
Charlottesville,
like all the people that called Dave 

1682
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:12,990
Rubin and Nazi now to use the same word 
for these people right now it has no 

1683
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:13,760
meaning.
Exactly.

1684
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,110
Good.
Very good point.

1685
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,130
Thank you.
It's a.

1686
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:21,210
it's really important to not overreact 
to people that don't have the exact same

1687
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:25,580
opinion as you.
Now when something like this happens,

1688
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,510
you realize,
okay,

1689
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,090
that's what you should react to.
Exactly.

1690
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:30,530
This is real.
This is real.

1691
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:35,531
You got a bunch of Douche bags with a 
fucking with torches from home depot or 

1692
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:36,500
wherever the fuck they got this.

1693
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,460
Those are those Citronella court people 
have been like the suburbs.

1694
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:45,700
They have like a Tiki party by some and 
now I can't come on because literally 

1695
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:50,321
kind of like I liked those torches for 
killing mosquitoes and I was thinking 

1696
01:17:50,321 --> 01:17:50,321
about it.
I'm like,

1697
01:17:50,321 --> 01:17:53,330
I'm not going to buy those now because 
of Charlottesville and all these guys.

1698
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:53,780
I mean,
if,

1699
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:56,660
if any of those people that are into 
that are listening,

1700
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,800
I'm not even upset at you as a human,
you get trapped into patterns of 

1701
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,350
thinking.
I'm upset at that pattern.

1702
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:11,740
I'm upset that this is a repeated 
repeating pattern that's happened 

1703
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:16,331
through human history where people 
decide that there's specific groups that

1704
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:21,431
somehow or another deserved preferential
treatment or are better or or or or 

1705
01:18:22,851 --> 01:18:25,910
superior or should dominate over other 
groups.

1706
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:31,060
It's stupid and it's bad for business.
It's bad for the business of being human

1707
01:18:31,761 --> 01:18:32,240
beings.

1708
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,480
It gets in the way.
You're.

1709
01:18:33,481 --> 01:18:38,481
You're judging people and nonsense and 
you get to all be in the group just 

1710
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:40,250
because you have similar skin color 
that's fucking stupid.

1711
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:44,430
You're allowing a bunch of losers in 
your group then because you're.

1712
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,060
The only differentiation is that they 
have to be white.

1713
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,500
That is insanely stupid.
It's so stupid,

1714
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:55,510
so don't miss out on all the cool black 
people you're going to miss out on all 

1715
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:55,820
the cool Cubans and all the cool Puerto 
Rican.

1716
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,570
You're going gonna miss out on them and 
you're gonna.

1717
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:02,590
You're gonna.
Think that you have some family in this 

1718
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:03,440
idea that you all have nordic routes or 
something like that.

1719
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:05,930
It's so dumb.
It's.

1720
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:11,110
I understand if you run into people that
are black and they're racist against 

1721
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:13,820
white people and you feel like you know,
white people have to protect themselves.

1722
01:19:13,821 --> 01:19:17,090
If you get one of those situations and 
those situations are real,

1723
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,110
they can happen.

1724
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:21,920
Racism can occur on both sides and this 
another disingenuous thing that the left

1725
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:26,870
is doing is accepting this idea that you
can only be racist if you're white.

1726
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,810
It's just a racist statement.
It's so racist.

1727
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,030
It's over,
but this is something that people were.

1728
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:35,180
I think they've kind of let it go for 
for most recently,

1729
01:19:35,181 --> 01:19:40,181
like out there in the twitter sphere,
but for a good long time it was a 

1730
01:19:40,181 --> 01:19:44,180
defensible argument that a black person 
couldn't be racist because racism is all

1731
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:47,180
about power and black people don't have 
power over white people.

1732
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:48,350
Like what's that?
That is,

1733
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:53,460
you're changing the word.
You're changing the fucking word and 

1734
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,710
you're going to empower actual racist 
course and it's like no one,

1735
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:59,770
you don't know Nazis till you know,
treaty of Versailles and you don't know 

1736
01:19:59,770 --> 01:19:59,960
this until like,
you know,

1737
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,990
just over shaming always has a 
springboard effect.

1738
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,930
Like I'll wait like after world war one,
it's the same with like,

1739
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:09,250
you know that shamed gay guys,
the one that hates gay people,

1740
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:14,251
you know,
where it's like shame is a horrible 

1741
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:15,570
thing and people and so world war one 
blood on our hands,

1742
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:20,630
you know,
that was started and executed for very 

1743
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:21,360
bizarre reasons.
They blamed Germany for all of it to the

1744
01:20:21,361 --> 01:20:25,230
point where they destroyed Germany and 
then they were looking for a voice.

1745
01:20:25,231 --> 01:20:27,780
It gave them hope and that voice is 
insane.

1746
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:30,900
And so that happens.
That happened in this where it's like,

1747
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:36,110
dear white people being white.
You should just say sorry all the 

1748
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:36,110
fucking time.
Even though your people came in 19.

1749
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:36,110
Oh,
you know,

1750
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:41,420
well you can see it today.
And the people that never criticized 

1751
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,351
trump and have like exclamation points 
and the right Magda after all their 

1752
01:20:44,351 --> 01:20:45,750
tweets,
no matter what trump does,

1753
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:48,240
no matter what trump says,
it's always amazing.

1754
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,410
Everything is always perfect.
Like,

1755
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:54,411
okay,
well I see what you're doing because 

1756
01:20:54,411 --> 01:20:54,411
you're not really thinking right.
Really thinking you,

1757
01:20:54,411 --> 01:20:54,411
you,
you,

1758
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:57,420
you gotTa fucking team your go raiders.
Let's go.

1759
01:20:57,421 --> 01:20:59,410
Raiders your let's go.
Trump like,

1760
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,320
well now this is not,
this is not healthy,

1761
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,140
this is not a normal way to discuss 
super important issues.

1762
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:08,880
Just wouldn't.
Trump said today that like,

1763
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:10,680
what's next?
They're going to take down the statue of

1764
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:15,681
George Washington.
It was like they took down a statue of 

1765
01:21:15,681 --> 01:21:15,681
Robert e Dot Lee and every freaking 
what's next?

1766
01:21:15,681 --> 01:21:15,900
We're going to take down the statue of 
George Washington.

1767
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:16,590
You're like,
what?

1768
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:21,710
Yeah.
That's like when the word normalizing 

1769
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:21,710
actually fits,
you know,

1770
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:25,371
like all these things that have been so 
flooded that is normalizing something 

1771
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:29,781
terrible,
but it's like so crazy competitive and 

1772
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,920
with Robert e Dot Lee is actually a 
problem,

1773
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,160
but the left is like over pointed out 
problems to the point where knowing like

1774
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,690
you can't have your,
you don't trust your instincts right now

1775
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:41,280
where you're like,
if I say this,

1776
01:21:41,281 --> 01:21:42,300
does this make me racist?

1777
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,460
It's like what?
That it's 80 degrees outside.

1778
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,240
How is that linked?
You know?

1779
01:21:46,241 --> 01:21:51,241
And also I think anybody coming in and 
deciding to do something is a problem.

1780
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:56,990
You know,
like people coming in and started 

1781
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:59,220
deciding to take down a statue.
Statues assembled to a lot of people and

1782
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:01,050
a lot of people step in and say,
hey,

1783
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:06,051
this is it.
I think there should be some sort of 

1784
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:08,520
real prolonged,
intelligent conversation about what that

1785
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:12,320
statute means and have it in a way we're
a bunch of people can,

1786
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:17,390
can see it and have it represented on 
both sides have been represented by the 

1787
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:22,161
side of people that think it's a good 
idea to keep it up and have it 

1788
01:22:22,161 --> 01:22:24,801
represented on the side of someone who 
thinks it's a good idea to move on and 

1789
01:22:24,801 --> 01:22:28,311
maybe we should take this thing and put 
it in some sort of a war museum and not 

1790
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:31,821
having it represent the goddamn 
confederate soldiers in the middle of 

1791
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,150
this town that's not confederate.
Okay.

1792
01:22:33,151 --> 01:22:35,070
We.
The war's gone because you're.

1793
01:22:35,071 --> 01:22:40,071
You're holding on to this idea that your
team lost a battle and that there's an 

1794
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,840
invading army that sitting with you.
Right?

1795
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:43,950
I know.
We're all Americans.

1796
01:22:43,951 --> 01:22:44,850
Okay.
This is old,

1797
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:45,900
old,
old shit.

1798
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,790
18 60 shit.
Okay,

1799
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:53,030
let it go stupid.
Let's take this down and let's put up a 

1800
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:56,400
goddamn glorious kid.
Rock Tattoo Style Eagle with a fucking 

1801
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,060
flag behind it.
Come out.

1802
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:01,110
Really Love America.
Let's take down the Robert e Dot Lee and

1803
01:23:01,111 --> 01:23:06,111
put up hulking American Eagle with a 
fucking flag in the wind.

1804
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,400
Just cash and then underneath it have a 
gigantic plaque of everybody that lost 

1805
01:23:12,431 --> 01:23:15,310
their lives in the last two wars over 
the last 20 years.

1806
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,020
Have that.
Yeah.

1807
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,580
I think a lot of it is how it's being 
represented to.

1808
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:22,540
Is it like a glorious statue or is it 
just a relic of history?

1809
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:26,080
Because I think the debate is a seen it.
No,

1810
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:27,430
I haven't either.
Let's look at it.

1811
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,880
Find out what's The statue of Robert e 
Lee that they were taking down.

1812
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,250
I'm curious.
Let me see.

1813
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:34,330
Oh,
what if he was found out?

1814
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:37,470
He was like banging a slave.
Oh,

1815
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,510
that's it.
Torch wielding protesters.

1816
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:42,040
Rally confederate statute.
Yeah.

1817
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,380
Can we go a large on that bunny?
Wow.

1818
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,760
That's beautiful.
Piece of art.

1819
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,380
You know,
I mean,

1820
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:49,510
much like when you look at [inaudible] 
con,

1821
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,010
it's a beautiful piece of art.
You know,

1822
01:23:51,011 --> 01:23:56,011
you look at some of the statues and 
things that they constructed from back 

1823
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:58,060
in his day.

1824
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,500
You let you think about it.
You Go,

1825
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,000
wow,
this was a guy at war.

1826
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,130
Yeah.
Who killed like a fit,

1827
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,790
like five percent of the earth.
Yeah,

1828
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,280
something even crazier.
I think he killed like 10 percent of the

1829
01:24:06,281 --> 01:24:08,290
world's population while he was alive.
Yeah.

1830
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:11,770
This is a tough one because this one,
because that is a rebel army we lost.

1831
01:24:11,771 --> 01:24:14,560
So that should be taken down,
but at the same time it's like,

1832
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,980
but what do you do with.
And then to the natives,

1833
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,290
Americans tell people to take down in 
Washington,

1834
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,320
you know,
then you start,

1835
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:22,210
then you start getting in a battle of 
like,

1836
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,000
well this person wronged my people.
Well this person.

1837
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:26,320
And then you,
you know,

1838
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:30,520
like I see people with Che shirts from 
urban outfitters and I'm like,

1839
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,700
that dude committed genocide.
Do a lot of people,

1840
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:34,870
you know.
And it's like,

1841
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:38,110
at what point is it with this one?

1842
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:42,250
I think that it's a valid argument to 
take it down because it was a rebel army

1843
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:46,510
and well I'm just a rebel army in the 
country that it's still in,

1844
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:50,980
but at the same time it's like it's a 
slippery slope of a racing.

1845
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:52,270
Right.
You know?

1846
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,920
Well,
I don't think you should have it in your

1847
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:55,570
state capital,
wherever the fuck that.

1848
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:57,340
Is that what it is?
State Capitol building.

1849
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:58,510
Oh,
that's a no brainer.

1850
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:01,050
Yeah.
Represents that state what it is,

1851
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:06,810
but see if he could pull it up again 
just so we know what the fuck we're 

1852
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:06,810
talking about.
I think that was kind of like.

1853
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,050
I think it was like a state building.
Look,

1854
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:13,090
it was a big deal.
That's how I felt about confederate 

1855
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:13,090
flag.
I'm like,

1856
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:15,421
obviously take it off state buildings.
Justice is still a part of a few 

1857
01:25:15,421 --> 01:25:16,270
different flags.
Right.

1858
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:19,180
That's that to me crosses that line 
where you're like,

1859
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:24,210
oh,
well now you're incorporating it into 

1860
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:25,180
the government that a lot of people 
associate with like valid social issues.

1861
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,680
I mean,
to this day,

1862
01:25:26,681 --> 01:25:29,740
I think it's on Mississippi's.
That's very intense.

1863
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:34,800
Yeah.
Emancipation park in front of their 

1864
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,230
courthouse in front of the courthouse.
Wow,

1865
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:36,190
man.
That's,

1866
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,540
that's a bit of a tone.
You can't do that.

1867
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,080
I mean,
you got to get that guy out of there.

1868
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,870
Look,
I think for sure we should keep it.

1869
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,460
I mean,
I don't think they should destroy it.

1870
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,260
Just like,
I don't think they should destroy,

1871
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:50,290
you know,
if there's a statue of mouse somewhere,

1872
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:52,120
I don't think they should destroy it.
I think we should.

1873
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:57,390
We should look at it and hold onto it so
that future generations can look back 

1874
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:57,390
and go,
wow,

1875
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,640
that's possible.
The Berlin Wall it a little pieces to be

1876
01:26:00,641 --> 01:26:01,410
like,
yeah,

1877
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,850
that people fucking the world into at 
one point.

1878
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:08,210
And if we forget that we started doing 
this live action role play until someone

1879
01:26:08,211 --> 01:26:09,620
gets hit by a car,
it's like,

1880
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,790
yeah,
well we

1881
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:11,700
better.
Right?

1882
01:26:11,701 --> 01:26:13,370
So we want better.
And so we pretend that better.

1883
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:18,380
We're already exists or is possible if 
we force people to behave the way we 

1884
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,110
want.
Right.

1885
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:24,290
You know,
there's a bunch of different ways where 

1886
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:24,290
people try to achieve better,
you know,

1887
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:28,300
and they're not all smart because a lot 
of them are based on how you feel right 

1888
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,760
now and what you want to change.
So you try to be forceful,

1889
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,340
but like the bounce back thing we're 
talking about,

1890
01:26:32,341 --> 01:26:34,530
it doesn't really work like that when 
you,

1891
01:26:34,531 --> 01:26:37,260
when you push too hard at people and you
don't respect them,

1892
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:42,810
um,
even if there is ridiculous as a white 

1893
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:42,930
nationalist,
when you push push at them.

1894
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,960
And why do I say it's ridiculous if 
you're asking because it's all 

1895
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,481
ridiculous.
I think being a black nationalist is 

1896
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:50,481
ridiculous too.
I think it's all ridiculous.

1897
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:53,940
I think you should be a human being and 
it just because you enjoy black culture,

1898
01:26:53,941 --> 01:26:55,140
it doesn't mean you have to be racist.

1899
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,840
You can enjoy Chinese people just as 
much.

1900
01:26:57,841 --> 01:27:02,841
We can all just be cool with each other.
But this idea that there's like one 

1901
01:27:02,841 --> 01:27:06,051
superior race is insane.
We are all interconnected in some very 

1902
01:27:06,631 --> 01:27:09,930
bizarre way and we help each other.
And that's what culture is.

1903
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:15,110
That's what civilization is.
The reason why it all works so well is 

1904
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:15,450
that we're all intertwined with each 
other,

1905
01:27:15,451 --> 01:27:20,451
learning from each other,
trying to figure out how to navigate 

1906
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:20,451
this thing together,
competing with each other,

1907
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:25,350
improving upon a whatever the fuck it is
we're working on because of the 

1908
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,060
competition from all sorts of different 
parts of the world,

1909
01:27:27,061 --> 01:27:30,690
different cultures and behavior patterns
and levels of aggression,

1910
01:27:30,691 --> 01:27:35,691
levels of intellect and all of us 
combined and some sort of a swarming 

1911
01:27:35,691 --> 01:27:39,711
soup of innovation and ideas and 
communication and trying to figure this 

1912
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:42,390
thing out together and as soon as you 
just lump it all up to white people only

1913
01:27:42,391 --> 01:27:45,540
like get the fuck Outta here with that 
old stupid idea.

1914
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:47,100
That's a stupid idea.

1915
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:52,490
Yeah,
and that's why I'm so anti pc and 

1916
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:53,070
cultural appropriation stuff because 
those are the mechanisms to share.

1917
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:54,820
Yeah.
It's like the.

1918
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:00,080
It's not because I'm white and I don't 
want people to get credit for whatever 

1919
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:00,960
they do it.
It's saying,

1920
01:28:00,961 --> 01:28:03,480
how do we know?
There's no quote that when goods,

1921
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:07,440
when good stop going across borders,
armies go across borders where it's like

1922
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:12,980
if see cultures coming together and 
sharing and developing and everything 

1923
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,160
you just said is necessary for 
multiculturalism,

1924
01:28:14,161 --> 01:28:19,161
and so if you say,
I can't wear some bro because I'm a 

1925
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:19,161
white guy,
he's no good.

1926
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:19,590
Even though I'm,
you know,

1927
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,800
stupid.
As long as you're not being an asshole 

1928
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,571
about it,
you just have fun and what's the big 

1929
01:28:26,571 --> 01:28:26,930
deal and who needs that?
Brim white guys pedals.

1930
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,190
Fuck right.
And we have a nice dark complexion.

1931
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:32,160
They can handle it.
I know Jews have no brim dude.

1932
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:33,540
Very good.
Very important point.

1933
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:38,760
Mexicans and juices with that,
with some of the Super Orthodox ones,

1934
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:40,100
they have the crazy brim,
right?

1935
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,730
Yeah.
They're like cheese heads with for.

1936
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,140
Oh,
that's a different one,

1937
01:28:43,141 --> 01:28:44,190
right?
That's a different one.

1938
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:45,690
That's a different kind of hat they 
were.

1939
01:28:45,691 --> 01:28:46,940
I've seen that one.
Yeah,

1940
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:51,950
that's a weird one.
It's like part of West Hollywood has a 

1941
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:51,950
bunch of those hats.
Yeah,

1942
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:51,950
that's an interesting thing.
Yeah.

1943
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:52,790
Hollywood,
when you drive,

1944
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:57,791
there's certain neighborhoods you go 
down to the all orthodox Jews or at 

1945
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:01,211
least a high volume of them.
You see them with their strings that 

1946
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:01,950
hang down from their belt.
Totally.

1947
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,010
Fear used to rock those,
those things.

1948
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:06,470
Oh yeah.
He had the whole whole garb.

1949
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,010
But that's so intense.
Those dudes are.

1950
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:13,040
There's the hat she's had with that is 
some ancient shit that that culture is 

1951
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:17,400
clinging to his bananas.
When do they say no?

1952
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:19,860
More like,
you know what year they like,

1953
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:20,730
all right,
we're 18.

1954
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:23,610
15 guys.
Well as long as you can keep together.

1955
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,970
I mean this is a nice representation of 
what we're talking about.

1956
01:29:26,971 --> 01:29:28,770
Non Integration,
you know,

1957
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:33,830
if you keep together in your own little 
community and only cohabitate with your 

1958
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:36,240
own,
you keep this thing going as long as you

1959
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:37,680
can and that's what they're doing right 
now.

1960
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:39,810
That's the irony of lack of oppression 
sometimes.

1961
01:29:39,811 --> 01:29:44,811
I was talking to these gay dudes in 
Houston recently and there are like 

1962
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:48,740
almost bummed that there,
like everyone loves gay people so much 

1963
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:49,170
because they don't feel as unified.

1964
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:53,790
Like we used to have a bar and I'm like,
you can still have the bar man.

1965
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:55,940
He's just now have the bravo channel to.
Yeah,

1966
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:58,200
but guys go in the bar now.
Like straight guys.

1967
01:29:58,201 --> 01:30:01,920
We're going to gay bars and girls.
Girls fucking love gay bars.

1968
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,860
You go to gay bars and that's why 
straight guys go there sometimes because

1969
01:30:04,861 --> 01:30:09,861
girls together,
it just for gas bar straight guys like 

1970
01:30:09,861 --> 01:30:11,400
they fucking weasel in on gay girls are 
drunk,

1971
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,120
drunk straight girls rather.
They do it.

1972
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:14,790
They're like,
it doesn't even matter if you touch it.

1973
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:17,680
I don't even feel anything.
I don't feel shit.

1974
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:19,650
Even when I'm coming I don't feel it.

1975
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,480
Or it also shows that they're so open 
minded.

1976
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:26,030
He goes to the gay bar.
I love that.

1977
01:30:26,031 --> 01:30:27,420
He's so confident.
Yeah.

1978
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:29,520
And women will go.
They're vulnerable sometimes,

1979
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:35,450
so it's like,
it's like I've just gotTa have a 

1980
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:35,460
relationship and I want to just talk and
not be hit on because I'm so vulnerable.

1981
01:30:35,461 --> 01:30:38,040
And then some dudes like it woke up my 
fanny pack.

1982
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:41,460
There's a duke in it.
You also have any bags by the way.

1983
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,060
It's like that a Mickey Rourke game that
he did in a diner.

1984
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:50,150
Remember the movie diner?
He put his Dick through the hole in the 

1985
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:50,150
bottom,
the bottom of the bucket of popcorn.

1986
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:54,830
See bed,
his friend that you'd grab his dick and 

1987
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:54,900
he's like no fucking way.
And He,

1988
01:30:54,901 --> 01:30:59,901
so he put his dick through the popcorn 
and then like as soon as she reached in 

1989
01:30:59,901 --> 01:30:59,970
and grabbed it,
wow.

1990
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,420
But what if she didn't realize it was 
his dick and just pulled up,

1991
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,440
was yanked it and broke it off like,
uh,

1992
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:08,820
like when you were hanging off that 
chimpanzee.

1993
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,880
There it is.
There's a scene that's back when we can 

1994
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:13,880
work as a beautiful man.
Can you imagine that scene now?

1995
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,630
Yeah.
Those skills just kind of say it's rape.

1996
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:18,300
That's essentially rape.
I mean,

1997
01:31:18,301 --> 01:31:19,710
you can't do that.
You can't,

1998
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,910
you can't force someone to be intimate 
with you and trick them if you're,

1999
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:26,130
if someone's intimate with you,
don't even play that on this show.

2000
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:27,690
God Damn it.
This is rape culture.

2001
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:29,130
He's shut that off right now.

2002
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:32,310
Too Hot.
Yeah.

2003
01:31:32,311 --> 01:31:34,980
Like when I was a kid,
it was so different that I have to train

2004
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:38,310
myself to not be like,
you should see how crazy chicken get.

2005
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:43,350
Right?
Like there used to be dudes just 

2006
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:43,350
whacking off in the street.
It was like weird.

2007
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,420
They really started dudes walking off in
the street.

2008
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:50,421
Well there was one dude in the middle 
school woods would just chase everyone 

2009
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:51,150
wagon off and it was like,
you tell your parents,

2010
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,610
like you tell your parents and your 
parents were like,

2011
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:54,870
yeah,
you can brush that one off.

2012
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:56,730
It's not.
They're crushed that one off.

2013
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:00,220
That was actual wiener right there.

2014
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:04,900
And yet there's a lot of drama in this 
movie.

2015
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,960
It's a slow burn.
People wouldn't even have time for that 

2016
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,691
today.
People are so twitter fied everybody's 

2017
01:32:12,691 --> 01:32:12,691
child.
There she goes,

2018
01:32:12,691 --> 01:32:13,510
she grabbed it and she's mad and she got
up to leave.

2019
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:17,200
Bam.
She's outraged.

2020
01:32:17,201 --> 01:32:20,140
But then when you pull the wean out,
all the popcorn is falls in your lap.

2021
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,230
Yeah.
You got to be.

2022
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:23,410
Watch this.
Here it goes.

2023
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:28,590
She's going to grab.
That was really subtly good.

2024
01:32:28,781 --> 01:32:31,040
Acting like he was like,
whoa.

2025
01:32:31,041 --> 01:32:32,050
It terrible.
Oh yeah.

2026
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:36,520
I really liked it.
The editing was bad,

2027
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,530
just obviously to texts to two 
different.

2028
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,020
That'd get a lot of coverage.
I was like,

2029
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:43,130
this happened,
but this happened before this app.

2030
01:32:43,131 --> 01:32:43,840
It was.
Why are you showing that?

2031
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:44,950
Like that?
Weird.

2032
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:46,380
It's like we got to get plenty of 
coverage.

2033
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:49,300
I almost had a replay.
Like a half a second replay.

2034
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:50,920
Yeah,
man.

2035
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:52,180
Um,
you can't do that anymore.

2036
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:55,060
Couldn't have that in the movie now 
probably for good.

2037
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:57,380
I don't know.
But I know I'm wrestling with that too.

2038
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,260
If it's fiction,
right?

2039
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:00,910
There are people like that that can 
exist.

2040
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:06,030
Like we were talking about murderers.
Are you allowed to have monsters and 

2041
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:08,851
murderers.
Are you allowed to show movies about 

2042
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:08,851
war?
Okay.

2043
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:08,851
Well,
if you are,

2044
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:12,340
how come you can have a rapist in a 
movie but you obviously can we use it in

2045
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:17,341
good taste?
Is it something people want to see 

2046
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:17,341
whole?
Won't the market dictate that?

2047
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:17,341
You know,
like,

2048
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:21,690
I don't.
I don't know if you should be able to 

2049
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:21,940
say that we're allowed to have murders 
in a movie,

2050
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:23,560
but we're not allowed to have rapists.
Yeah.

2051
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:24,990
It's got to be market.
Yeah.

2052
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,760
I feel like I don't want to see people 
get raped,

2053
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:32,790
but I don't know that you should be able
to tell someone they can't do that or 

2054
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:32,890
they can't write it out.

2055
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,770
Then it always ends bad.
That's the draw socialism.

2056
01:33:35,771 --> 01:33:38,710
It's narcissism where someone goes,
if I had control,

2057
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:42,400
everyone would be better.
And then even if that guy's awesome,

2058
01:33:42,401 --> 01:33:44,710
the next guy styling.
Well,

2059
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:49,711
that's the thing is like these,
these kind of like we're talking about 

2060
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:49,711
the statute,
having a long conversation.

2061
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:51,220
Like you have to have conversations 
about this kind of shit.

2062
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,790
Like should you want to read about rape?
Oh,

2063
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:59,910
of course not.
But should you be able to put whatever 

2064
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:00,820
the fuck you want into whatever it is 
that it's your,

2065
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:02,170
your,
um,

2066
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:03,910
your creation.
I mean,

2067
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:09,120
you're sitting there and you're writing 
out a story that you're manipulating 

2068
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:11,740
with your imagination.
You're putting it all together.

2069
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:15,490
You should be able to have horrific 
characters that everyone is terrified of

2070
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,210
that people trying to get away from.
If that includes rapists or murderers or

2071
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:19,990
whoever the fuck it is.

2072
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:22,930
If you're trying to tell a terrifying 
tale and a book,

2073
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:25,330
you can't be hindered,
you can't be stopped.

2074
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:28,180
Like we have to be really careful about 
what,

2075
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:29,650
what we're saying here.
Well,

2076
01:34:29,651 --> 01:34:32,680
we're submitting will to someone that 
doesn't have our best interests.

2077
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:33,850
That's what it is.
Because they don't.

2078
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,600
No one really cares that much.
I don't think they care,

2079
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:39,970
but I don't think they're thinking.
I think it's more of a,

2080
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:44,971
not thinking about this like it doesn't,
just because someone has a book about 

2081
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:46,990
rapist doesn't mean people are going to 
rape more because like if there's a book

2082
01:34:46,991 --> 01:34:47,980
about,
you know,

2083
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:51,130
people that are murderers and I'm going 
to go out and murder more,

2084
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,180
you know,
that's.

2085
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,890
I don't,
I don't believe that that's valid.

2086
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:57,790
I think when you talking about fiction,
um,

2087
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:58,040
and

2088
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,020
again,
I don't want to read about it,

2089
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:05,200
but I don't want you to be able to tell 
people that they can't write about 

2090
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,680
certain things.
That seems to me like way over the line,

2091
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,600
like way over the line.
Yeah.

2092
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:10,880
Because then you can't do critical 
government stuff.

2093
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:15,881
It's the legal precedent that set that 
then makes the craziest shit possible 

2094
01:35:15,881 --> 01:35:16,010
where it's like,
oh,

2095
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:18,620
this is a words are violence.
These words are violence.

2096
01:35:18,621 --> 01:35:20,750
I'm raped now.
No one can say like,

2097
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,570
our new president is horrible.
You know,

2098
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:28,571
like now you can't even show descent.
It's all just a way to tighten the 

2099
01:35:28,571 --> 01:35:32,111
screws.
Don't you think that people in the left 

2100
01:35:32,111 --> 01:35:33,080
or show showing dissent more than like a
violent descent towards the president,

2101
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,750
like really like,
angry,

2102
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:40,780
like in a way that I can't remember 
anybody doing towards Obama now to the 

2103
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:40,970
point where it freaks me out.

2104
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:42,560
Like they're like,
it's weird.

2105
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:43,520
Well,
I didn't,

2106
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:46,760
I wasn't obviously traveling in the 
right circles.

2107
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:48,830
Look for people that really angry at 
Obama,

2108
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:51,280
but even the people that I saw online 
that are angry and um,

2109
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,210
they were calling them and competent or 
food.

2110
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:56,000
We're spending all of our money and all 
this different accusations,

2111
01:35:56,180 --> 01:36:01,180
but not like what I'm seeing with trump.
Like I'm seeing just like flat out 

2112
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,510
insults from famous people all the time.
Yeah.

2113
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,520
And the media,
I don't get why people totally trust 

2114
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,441
immediate.
It's like you'll see them misrepresent 

2115
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:13,970
something in such an egregious way and 
my dad is a rhetoric professor,

2116
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:16,430
so it's like he teaches a class in 
propaganda.

2117
01:36:16,431 --> 01:36:18,410
This is like my whole childhood is 
learning about the shit.

2118
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:20,600
I'm watching CNN.
I'm like,

2119
01:36:20,601 --> 01:36:25,601
you motherfuckers,
you know exactly like you can 

2120
01:36:25,601 --> 01:36:26,030
misrepresent things so egregiously that 
I'm like,

2121
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:29,090
of course no one's going to trust you 
and that's a real problem.

2122
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:30,380
Right,
and it's not that you.

2123
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:33,440
You don't wish that they were correct,
right?

2124
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:38,740
It's that in them lying.
Even if you're on their side more than 

2125
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:42,710
you're on the Fox News,
CNN lies even a little.

2126
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:48,430
Then it's fuel for the other side and it
vastly diminishes the impact that you 

2127
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:51,260
can have because you're not.
You're not trustworthy anymore.

2128
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:56,630
That's all you have in news now is 
trustworthiness because everyone can 

2129
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:56,630
manipulate and photoshop.
Now that,

2130
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:58,430
that,
that Audio Photoshop,

2131
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:01,220
oh my God.
It's like you have to just trust people.

2132
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:06,280
I can't trust anybody though.
It's real issue and an issue with an 

2133
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,780
issue with the left being so hyperbolic.
It's like when trump was first elected,

2134
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:09,320
I was like,
ah,

2135
01:37:09,321 --> 01:37:10,880
sucks.
Trump's crazy,

2136
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:15,290
and then I saw their reaction and almost
like triaged it and I was like,

2137
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,430
wait a minute,
what's crazier?

2138
01:37:16,431 --> 01:37:19,880
The guy that may like texted dictator is
Dick,

2139
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:24,500
or like people like saying that 
democracy is bad and I'm like,

2140
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:26,330
this is a weird battle.

2141
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:31,510
Well,
it's certainly not the result that 

2142
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:31,510
people wanted,
right?

2143
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:32,120
Like a lot of people.
And so having him there,

2144
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:35,390
they're super frustrated and all the 
things that they see happening,

2145
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,540
people are super frustrated and they 
don't know what to do.

2146
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:39,780
And so,
um,

2147
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:44,910
the,
the feeling is that you should somehow 

2148
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:47,421
under the protest and riot and like the 
people that got in front of trump tower 

2149
01:37:47,421 --> 01:37:47,780
because of his reaction to 
Charlottesville,

2150
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,180
people are super upset at his reaction.
That was,

2151
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:52,900
I think that was a big one when he said 
that,

2152
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:57,920
you know,
that something about despicable acts of 

2153
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:57,920
violence on

2154
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:57,920
all sides.
See,

2155
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,340
that was,
that was crazy that he did that.

2156
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:01,750
Whoa,
okay.

2157
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:06,980
One,
you have people that are fighting and 

2158
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:09,920
whoever side you're on,
whether you're the side that wants to 

2159
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,581
keep statue up and you want white people
to get the respect or whether you're on 

2160
01:38:12,581 --> 01:38:16,281
the side of the things that you guys are
a bunch of racists and call yourself 

2161
01:38:16,281 --> 01:38:16,830
white nationals all day.
You're a bunch of Nazis.

2162
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,000
W,
whichever side it is,

2163
01:38:18,001 --> 01:38:23,001
I don't know which side you're on,
but as soon as someone Joe's driving a 

2164
01:38:23,001 --> 01:38:26,301
fucking car into all those people and 
you find out that guy is a Nazi or that 

2165
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:30,540
guy's a Nazi sympathizer or whatever,
he is a white nationalist,

2166
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:34,950
you've got to go look.
This thinking is shit brained Shit brand

2167
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:37,710
that you think you could just drive a 
car into a group of people,

2168
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:38,970
including a girl.

2169
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:41,520
You killed a girl with a car.
Yeah,

2170
01:38:41,521 --> 01:38:44,790
it's who crosses the line into violence.
I was actual violence,

2171
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:47,380
random violence and terrorism.
Jurors.

2172
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,060
No,
no.

2173
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:53,061
Look in the eye,
no interaction with them stomping on a 

2174
01:38:53,061 --> 01:38:56,780
gas of a car.
It's one of the most cowardly acts you 

2175
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,950
could ever do.
It's a horrifically terrorist activity.

2176
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:04,070
It's horrifically terrorist in the in 
the way that it's like sheer terror that

2177
01:39:04,231 --> 01:39:07,860
this could ever happen to you,
that someone could just gun a car into a

2178
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:12,861
random group of people and slam into 
whoever didn't get out of the way and 

2179
01:39:12,861 --> 01:39:16,590
they think that think that that would be
the thing to do against your people from

2180
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:20,490
your own country,
just over ideology and and I.

2181
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:21,780
Yeah,
that's unbelievable.

2182
01:39:21,781 --> 01:39:26,781
Whether or not you should take down a 
statue of a guy who was the commanding 

2183
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:31,851
general in the losing army of a civil 
war and you've got that in front of a 

2184
01:39:31,851 --> 01:39:31,851
courthouse.

2185
01:39:31,851 --> 01:39:33,000
This is a little weird,
right?

2186
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:38,300
We should have this discussion.
We should at least have this problem is 

2187
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,150
people aren't allowing discussions.
You get labeled racist,

2188
01:39:39,151 --> 01:39:40,100
sexist,
homophobic,

2189
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,380
immediately or the opposite.
You get labeled a Nazi.

2190
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:45,750
If you even think like from a historical
point of view like,

2191
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:50,751
Hey,
we should respect that this statue is a 

2192
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:53,931
part of our culture and our history.
We don't embrace the ideals of the 

2193
01:39:53,931 --> 01:39:55,530
confederate army.
We're not trying to bring back slavery.

2194
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:00,560
We're not racist.
We just think that there's a unique and 

2195
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,910
interesting history of the south is as 
unfortunate as it is.

2196
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,130
It's all connected to slavery.
You know,

2197
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:10,131
this,
this is not entirely with this guy 

2198
01:40:10,131 --> 01:40:12,501
represents to us.
Like if that's the argument you're 

2199
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:12,501
making,
okay,

2200
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:14,310
well then we should probably have some 
sort of a confederate army museum.

2201
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:19,670
You know,
where people can go and just observe 

2202
01:40:19,670 --> 01:40:22,010
like the strangeness of it all because 
it is strange whether or not you are on 

2203
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,010
the north and south.

2204
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:26,300
It's strange that in 18,
65 people were shooting each other and 

2205
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:31,041
the only difference was like they were 
cross align the Mason Dixon brothers 

2206
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:33,810
shooting your other crazy and that just 
happened,

2207
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,340
right?
Just a couple of hundred years ago.

2208
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,170
Yeah,
we lost 800,000

2209
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:40,890
people and only three percent of people 
on slaves in the south.

2210
01:40:40,891 --> 01:40:44,250
So think about how many casualties were 
like what the fuck.

2211
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:48,090
The whole thing is in the immigrants in 
the north just right off the boat.

2212
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:48,840
Italy,
Ireland,

2213
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:52,950
just grab a gun and go die.
Fuck man.

2214
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:58,640
Just stop and think about how insane 
that is and there should be some way 

2215
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,500
that we addressed this in,
in these areas.

2216
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:07,501
I don't think it's a statue of Robert e 
Dot Lee in front of some important 

2217
01:41:07,501 --> 01:41:11,760
federal building or state building.
I think you should take all that stuff 

2218
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,530
and bring it someplace where you have 
like a museum or a,

2219
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:15,880
you know,
an area where you have,

2220
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:20,490
where people can go and you have experts
that give tours this unexplained.

2221
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,710
Put it all in context.
Explain who this guy was.

2222
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:25,510
You know,
have like a tour that people do.

2223
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,140
That's an allison idea.
Massively educational and it doesn't,

2224
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:30,280
you know,
look,

2225
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:33,250
nobody today was a part of the fucking 
confederate army.

2226
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,600
Okay?
If you're,

2227
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:37,600
if you're a 30 year old guy today,
you are not a part of that.

2228
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:42,690
Okay?
You're a human being that lives in 

2229
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:44,881
America.
You're not responsible for the sins of 

2230
01:41:44,881 --> 01:41:47,431
your ancestors,
nor are you obligated to continue the 

2231
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:50,191
same ridiculous ideas that maybe you 
were raised with or other people were 

2232
01:41:50,191 --> 01:41:50,191
raised with two,
it's,

2233
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:55,260
it's not smart.
We're supposed to be all in this 

2234
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:57,451
together.
If we all got attacked by whether it's 

2235
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:59,020
some invading army or fucking aliens 
from outer space,

2236
01:41:59,021 --> 01:42:04,021
I mean that was like a famous Ronald 
Reagan quote about how quickly we would 

2237
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:09,690
forget about our differences between us 
and Russia if we were attacked by an 

2238
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:09,940
alien force from outside of this planet.

2239
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,080
So true.
So true.

2240
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:14,260
And it's not even just the concept of 
reminiscing is new.

2241
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:19,261
Like I do a song a summer of 18,
69 just to put in perspective how good 

2242
01:42:20,261 --> 01:42:23,710
we have it now and we should be 
celebrating every day.

2243
01:42:23,711 --> 01:42:25,800
Like Holy Shit,
you go into any drugstore.

2244
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:27,670
This could've killed kings.
It's a dollar.

2245
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:31,600
But like we just myself included,
I can't do that.

2246
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:34,210
I just think relatively to what I've 
seen in my life.

2247
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:37,630
But like if you think about the summer 
of 18,

2248
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:42,631
69,
like people are dying of like Spanish 

2249
01:42:42,631 --> 01:42:44,410
flu and shit like crazy.
So 100 mile ride to get butter.

2250
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:48,400
Oh yeah.
I mean and that's like modern times,

2251
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,080
you know?
I mean think about back when.

2252
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:55,140
The only reason why we're here is 
because people had to breed from the 

2253
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:57,670
time we weren't people that had to keep 
from the time we were,

2254
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:02,700
some sort of,
that's if you believe in all that 

2255
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:03,070
liberal bullshit,
but evolution,

2256
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:06,550
which is mostly just a plot concocted by
the Jew.

2257
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,090
Um,
but if you,

2258
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:13,170
if you do pay attention to evolution,
we came from some sort of a lower 

2259
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:16,801
hominid and we evolved over time.
We kept improving natural selection and 

2260
01:43:16,981 --> 01:43:20,350
all sorts of different factors and 
mutations.

2261
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:23,380
We improved and became what we are 
today.

2262
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:24,610
Well,
that means we had,

2263
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:24,970
uh,
we had,

2264
01:43:24,971 --> 01:43:25,430
uh,
we,

2265
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:28,510
we bred back when we were almost like 
fish people,

2266
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,640
right?
We kept going through this whole thing,

2267
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:36,310
what we are today.
The only reason why anybody ever got 

2268
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:40,351
better than those people that had to 
walk 10 miles for butter because they 

2269
01:43:40,351 --> 01:43:40,420
were like,
fuck walking 10 miles for butter.

2270
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:43,210
We've got to figure this out better.
And so no one's ever happy.

2271
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:45,550
No one's ever happy with the current 
state of affairs because like,

2272
01:43:45,551 --> 01:43:47,800
why am I still walking?
Where's my fucking flying car?

2273
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,690
Where's my,
a tele porter?

2274
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,980
What I can't go to Mars right now,
we're going to go to Mars right

2275
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,700
now and that's the gene that passed.
I got,

2276
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:57,100
I was trying to explain to some buddies 
in the UK because I do stamp their lot.

2277
01:43:57,101 --> 01:44:02,101
I'm like,
Americans are a little fucking crazy 

2278
01:44:02,101 --> 01:44:02,101
because we were the dudes who agreed to 
come here,

2279
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:07,300
you know,
like if you're going to do it genetic 

2280
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:07,300
just cut and it's like,
okay,

2281
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,660
you're probably going to die,
but there's golden pussy.

2282
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:11,060
Well it's like one out of 200 people's 
like,

2283
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:13,190
all right,
and then they settled in America.

2284
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,290
Those guys need a hug.
They're insane.

2285
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:20,320
And then that that's settled America and
then that's why some of us are just so 

2286
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,020
wacky.
Like people weren't even drinking water.

2287
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:26,700
They're just hammered all the time 
trying to make big decisions about 

2288
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,550
slavery.
It just sounds terrible,

2289
01:44:28,551 --> 01:44:29,390
man.
So hard.

2290
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:31,640
And that's the other thing when it comes
to like racism.

2291
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:33,050
Racism is horrible.

2292
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:34,460
It's horrible today,
right?

2293
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:40,210
But I think it's better than it.
I saw a post by killer Mike or thinks 

2294
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:42,200
very cool dude.
I want to have him on eventually.

2295
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,490
I liked that guy,
seems like he's fun and he,

2296
01:44:44,491 --> 01:44:49,491
uh,
he had a post on his instagram about 

2297
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:51,941
saying America is exactly the same and 
it was essentially saying you should be 

2298
01:44:51,941 --> 01:44:54,881
armed.
He was saying anybody tells you you 

2299
01:44:54,881 --> 01:44:57,520
shouldn't be armed and you know,
and be trained in how to use a firearm 

2300
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,600
is a crazy,
some sort of an agent of the state.

2301
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:00,200
I was like,
Whoa,

2302
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:01,550
killer.
Mike's going deep,

2303
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:03,800
but I'm onboard.
Yeah.

2304
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:06,530
Well,
but I think it is different.

2305
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:09,860
I do think it is different from 1963.
I really do.

2306
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:12,620
I really think it's a lot better than it
was in the sixties.

2307
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:14,540
I think it still sucks in some spots 
though.

2308
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:17,690
And I think emotional,
like events like this,

2309
01:45:17,691 --> 01:45:22,691
as horrific as they are,
they're good for a lot of people that 

2310
01:45:22,691 --> 01:45:23,750
live in places outside of their.

2311
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:24,680
Well,
they didn't know,

2312
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:30,010
you know,
you get caught in the pattern of 

2313
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:31,520
whatever your environment is and if 
you're in an environment of stagnant,

2314
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:36,580
ancient racism that goes back to the 
slave days and goes back to pre civil 

2315
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:41,441
war and then it's like the same area at 
the new ideas are slowly making their 

2316
01:45:41,441 --> 01:45:46,331
way in because it's not like a lot of 
influx of new people moving into these 

2317
01:45:46,331 --> 01:45:46,530
places either.
Right.

2318
01:45:46,531 --> 01:45:51,531
As people having kids and the kids may 
be learning a little bit at school and 

2319
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:54,900
you know,
it's a slow process of getting out the 

2320
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:57,731
shitty ideas.
It's like you're a bit about the Middle 

2321
01:45:57,731 --> 01:45:57,731
East or the townies of the world.
It's so true.

2322
01:45:57,731 --> 01:45:59,960
It's like just the people that don't 
weave and then.

2323
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:02,690
Well it's Iraq and specific because Iraq
is Sumir,

2324
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:07,691
which is where the oldest known 
civilization is what's so fucked over 

2325
01:46:07,691 --> 01:46:08,740
there that they really are like the 
townies of the world and,

2326
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:09,920
and like tribalism.

2327
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,920
Like you go to UK and it's Catholic 
Protestant and they don't give a shit 

2328
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:14,920
about.
Right.

2329
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,700
They don't have the same history as us 
and they're like,

2330
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:18,410
I heard a great Irish joke.
There was a,

2331
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,260
are you Catholic or Protestant guy goes,
I'm atheist,

2332
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:23,840
and the other guy goes,
which one don't you believe in?

2333
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:30,030
Where it's like are you answered them 
and like you can just split it up based 

2334
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:32,180
on counties in England and here it's 
skin and yeah dude,

2335
01:46:32,181 --> 01:46:34,910
when I was in Ireland in Northern 
Ireland as well,

2336
01:46:34,911 --> 01:46:39,911
I went to Belfast once and there was a 
bunch of people that were there that 

2337
01:46:39,911 --> 01:46:40,840
were there,
you know,

2338
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,770
the guy guys were in their late forties 
and fifties.

2339
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:48,650
They were telling me about back in the 
day with the bombings with the IRA and 

2340
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:53,370
they were explaining to me some horrific
things that were done to people there.

2341
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:55,950
I mean the,
these are Irish people going after other

2342
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:56,750
Irish people.
Right.

2343
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:02,720
And the cop cars there are fully armored
like war vehicles.

2344
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:06,090
Like I've never seen anything like it 
and all the places that have been.

2345
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:11,091
I've never seen anything like it where 
the cop cars are covered with steel 

2346
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:15,291
plates,
like Steel Mesh on the front steel 

2347
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:15,291
plates and battering rams.
I was like,

2348
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:16,050
okay,
what the fuck is this?

2349
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:18,150
That God's bomb proof.
I was like,

2350
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,830
what?
It can get a lot worse,

2351
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:20,670
man.
This is.

2352
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,690
This is Northern Ireland and I'm talking
about shit.

2353
01:47:24,691 --> 01:47:27,270
I want to say like 2006,
something like that.

2354
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:30,000
Somewhere around.
Then I was there and I was like,

2355
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:35,020
Holy Shit,
you're Dan Carlin was talking about 

2356
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:36,540
1968.
There was like 40,000

2357
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:39,090
bombings.
Like something that I had to look up.

2358
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:44,180
I probably got that wrong,
but it was like the weatherman man and 

2359
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:45,990
all these like homegrown,
like chicken get jad.

2360
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:47,790
There used to be a machine guns on the 
White House.

2361
01:47:47,791 --> 01:47:52,791
Tooth Shit can get bad.
It's only been really good for like a 

2362
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:56,190
short amount of time.
That's why I value it so much.

2363
01:47:56,570 --> 01:48:01,570
Yeah,
but it's hard for us to have a 

2364
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:01,570
perspective of how bad it used to be.
You know,

2365
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:04,980
if you ever seen that section of France,
that's France,

2366
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,250
that's how you know Moroccan,
but in France if I said fronts,

2367
01:48:08,251 --> 01:48:09,680
I'd be an asshole.
It's weird.

2368
01:48:09,681 --> 01:48:12,610
So a tricky little fucking road to 
navigate,

2369
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:16,250
but Lido is the same way.
Have you seen that area where it's a.

2370
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:21,560
it's like essentially no man's land.
You can't go into it because there's so 

2371
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:26,541
much unexploded ordinance that literally
there's so much toxic shit from these 

2372
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:31,671
bombs that is an area the size of Paris 
that you can't go to.

2373
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:35,130
That's a monumental like fucking fenced 
off.

2374
01:48:35,131 --> 01:48:40,131
You can't go in there and they keep 
pulling shit out of there and they're 

2375
01:48:40,131 --> 01:48:40,131
like,
people collect them,

2376
01:48:40,131 --> 01:48:42,060
you know they have like a rescue them.

2377
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:45,150
I mean Chai and fucking bullets and 
missiles and shit.

2378
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:48,450
That was recent.
Same with the eastern front and Russia,

2379
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,180
like the ghost of the Asta Front,
that hardcore history series,

2380
01:48:51,570 --> 01:48:54,720
like just the bone fields where you like
things.

2381
01:48:54,721 --> 01:48:57,330
It's right out of a pink floyd video 
where you're like,

2382
01:48:57,870 --> 01:49:00,630
alright,
so I have a problem with pronouns,

2383
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:05,990
but it's like I'll fucking fight to the 
death for this.

2384
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:14,030
If you were a really smooth transition,
transgender persons,

2385
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:17,160
absolutely no issue because no one can 
tell.

2386
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,770
Feel like Thai people.
You slide right in.

2387
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:24,980
Nobody gives a shit slip in comes an 
issue when it's not obvious.

2388
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,120
Yeah.
It's like the valley,

2389
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:32,400
the [inaudible] valley with robot faces.
Yeah.

2390
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:34,800
What is that called?
Uncanny valley.

2391
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:36,600
Where if it's like close,
but a little off.

2392
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:39,080
Yeah,
a little like something's wrong here.

2393
01:49:39,110 --> 01:49:39,760
Yeah.
It's not.

2394
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:40,710
No,
I'm ashes.

2395
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:43,410
Ashes.
Simulation.

2396
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,870
Like when my piano teacher got a sex 
change,

2397
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:48,190
like no one really cared as long as he's
still

2398
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:49,600
matched that,
like the demo,

2399
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:51,400
like,
like in the bills and shit like that,

2400
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:52,900
you know,
it's a shit.

2401
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:55,590
No one cares.
So highly publicized case.

2402
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:58,720
Well the thing is why should you care?
Like do whatever you want to do,

2403
01:49:58,721 --> 01:50:01,480
but also,
you know,

2404
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,510
like don't,
don't swing too hard the other direction

2405
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:05,590
either.
Exactly.

2406
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:07,330
It's gotta be,
it's got to be in the middle.

2407
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,010
It's got to be like you.
You can't be a,

2408
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,900
you don't get special treatment.
Last.

2409
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:15,520
Yeah.
Well it sounded like that.

2410
01:50:15,521 --> 01:50:17,210
Like you don't,
we don't pull up.

2411
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:21,520
Pretend you're amazing and beautiful and
incredible and a hero and you know,

2412
01:50:21,521 --> 01:50:23,770
such a hero and so brave like,
okay,

2413
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:29,010
we should,
we should respect your choice and we 

2414
01:50:29,010 --> 01:50:32,221
should.
You should live in a world where you 

2415
01:50:32,221 --> 01:50:32,221
don't have to worry about people getting
upset.

2416
01:50:32,221 --> 01:50:33,760
That's the real problem.
The real problem is not that.

2417
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,760
It's this amazing thing to do the real 
problem as it should be able to be a 100

2418
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:44,191
percent free choice that no one cares 
about and no one should fuck with you 

2419
01:50:44,191 --> 01:50:46,060
because you do it like no one should 
hate you because of your choice.

2420
01:50:46,061 --> 01:50:51,061
The real problem is that people hate 
them because their choice and then 

2421
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:51,061
because of that,
you want to say,

2422
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:53,560
I am not like those people.
I think you're the most special unicorns

2423
01:50:53,561 --> 01:50:56,830
ever existed in the world and you're 
amazing and you're my hero.

2424
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:00,000
My hero is near that house.
Okay,

2425
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:05,100
okay.
Maybe it's just 10 people are operating 

2426
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:07,471
from fear to where it's like they are 
starting to say like a six year old can 

2427
01:51:07,471 --> 01:51:11,131
choose their gender and then and then 
have hormones that don't go through 

2428
01:51:11,131 --> 01:51:13,921
puberty and that's when.
And that's when I think back to all 

2429
01:51:13,921 --> 01:51:17,731
those idiots that I would always 
disagree with where it's like stay away 

2430
01:51:17,731 --> 01:51:17,731
from my kids.

2431
01:51:17,731 --> 01:51:18,130
Gay Guy Might,
good guys,

2432
01:51:18,131 --> 01:51:20,000
don't give a fuck about your kids.
But then when,

2433
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:21,370
when you think like,
oh my God,

2434
01:51:21,371 --> 01:51:25,090
the state could enforce my six year old 
a sex change.

2435
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:27,700
You can't do that.
They don't do that.

2436
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:29,320
It has to be the parents,
right?

2437
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:31,390
The parents have to bring the kids 
somewhere,

2438
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:33,700
but it's the question is when is it old 
enough?

2439
01:51:33,730 --> 01:51:35,980
Like is it okay when you're 18,
man,

2440
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:40,981
I don't think you should.
I the fucking frontal cortex doesn't 

2441
01:51:40,981 --> 01:51:41,080
even get fully formed until you're 25.
Right.

2442
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:42,790
So like what are you doing?
Making big choices?

2443
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:47,140
Like if I had to go back and think about
like some super important choices that I

2444
01:51:47,141 --> 01:51:49,600
could have made when I was 18 and 
whether or not I've been rational,

2445
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:53,440
I was essentially a monkey with a 
language.

2446
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:56,230
Like I thought like a monkey.
I act like a monkey.

2447
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:59,050
There's no way I should have been ever 
respond.

2448
01:51:59,051 --> 01:52:01,390
Especially something that could affect 
you for the rest of your life.

2449
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:04,980
Like the idea of when you're 18,
you can get a tattoo like Jesus Christ.

2450
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:09,670
This is like sterilizing and also like 
an industry can pop up.

2451
01:52:09,671 --> 01:52:12,720
Like my parents felt that way about 
circumcision I imagine like,

2452
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:13,870
like they're like,
yeah,

2453
01:52:13,871 --> 01:52:17,050
you guys can be circumcised and you turn
18 so you can decide on your own.

2454
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:18,360
That's how it should be.
Yeah.

2455
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,810
It shouldn't even be.
You know,

2456
01:52:19,811 --> 01:52:24,811
like you should be able to do whatever 
you want to do when you can decide that 

2457
01:52:24,811 --> 01:52:26,290
cutting off your wayne part of your rain
and you lose a lot of Dick's this way.

2458
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:27,150
Folks.
Okay.

2459
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:29,050
People don't wanna admit it,
but there's a lot of infections.

2460
01:52:29,051 --> 01:52:32,410
People lose their dicks every year.
Babies lose their dicks because of this.

2461
01:52:32,411 --> 01:52:37,411
This is a fact.
It's not a lot in terms of the actual 

2462
01:52:37,411 --> 01:52:37,411
numbers of people that are getting 
circumcised,

2463
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:40,720
but it's a handful like you want to take
that chance.

2464
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,760
Yeah.
Risk reward on that fuck all the time 

2465
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:45,760
about propaganda.
Saying that like,

2466
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:46,100
you know you're always going to have 
infections

2467
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:51,100
and shit.
They were just trying to get an extra 

2468
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:52,391
500 bucks a clip.
How many babies do you think lose their 

2469
01:52:52,391 --> 01:52:54,340
penis every year from infection due to 
circumstances?

2470
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:57,190
I say five in America.
I say five.

2471
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,510
What'd he say?
Lose their Dick.

2472
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:01,730
Because Dick had infected from clipping.
Yeah.

2473
01:53:01,810 --> 01:53:04,130
Yeah.
I'm going to say 11.

2474
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,390
11,
11.

2475
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,440
Okay.
Full digital.

2476
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,810
Jim's going to pull.
Well,

2477
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:10,670
any parts,
even partial loss.

2478
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:14,180
Cut off the tip of your Dick that 
sometimes that's just as fucked.

2479
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:16,190
Going to reconstruct the tip of your 
Dick.

2480
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:17,900
Yeah.
I feel like my winter is like,

2481
01:53:17,901 --> 01:53:22,901
you know,
I got like a arm to take your nose and 

2482
01:53:22,901 --> 01:53:24,710
they put it on the tip of your Dick and 
they give you a when you.

2483
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:28,880
Likewise,
I my notes,

2484
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,790
my Dick is sniffling,
the kid can't even make a fucking choice

2485
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:36,791
for himself.
I know it's happened before and one kid 

2486
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:36,830
lost his penis in a circumcision 
accident and so they tried to transition

2487
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:41,831
him to be in a woman and then he was 
suicidal and they turned it back into a 

2488
01:53:41,831 --> 01:53:42,560
man that he wound up killing himself.
It turns out that's not all societal.

2489
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:44,180
It was a famous case is,
uh,

2490
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:47,580
I forget the name of the boy who,
uh,

2491
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:49,700
I've read that book and I forgot though.
Yeah,

2492
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,710
I forgot to what,
which book was that?

2493
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:56,890
I can't remember.
It was like a kid named Gary or one and 

2494
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:01,440
200.
One into whoa.

2495
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:05,390
I have what it was,
were real bad.

2496
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,050
Wound infections serious is what it 
says.

2497
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,560
One and $200.
Okay.

2498
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:12,250
But how many of them lose their dicks?
I don't.

2499
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:17,510
Didn't do studies on.
I saw a study once that said that more 

2500
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:20,330
teenagers than ever are engaging in anal
sex.

2501
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,220
And I thought about that.
I was like,

2502
01:54:22,221 --> 01:54:25,160
who the fuck is doing that science?
Like what?

2503
01:54:25,161 --> 01:54:26,660
Scientists sitting around like,
hmm,

2504
01:54:26,661 --> 01:54:29,660
what should I study?
Global warming asteroidal impacts.

2505
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:33,430
Know How many of these kids are,
but fucking I need to get those buttfuck

2506
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:38,470
numbers.
I needed to get the numbers and he's 

2507
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:38,470
going to be honest.
It's like a.

2508
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:38,750
it's like a trump poll and the election,
right?

2509
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,680
It's true.
It's like,

2510
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:42,600
who's going to be like,
yeah,

2511
01:54:42,601 --> 01:54:47,180
I haven't bought fucking blood fucking 
favorite thing.

2512
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:52,360
Well,
I think porn changed the game for all 

2513
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:52,360
that shit.
Like no one was.

2514
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:55,900
It did for sure know.
Everyone's pretty high level going into 

2515
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:55,900
going into it now.
Yeah.

2516
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:57,530
Yeah.
It's a total different experience.

2517
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,940
It's too many people to watch them.

2518
01:54:58,940 --> 01:54:59,930
Too many people.
Fuck now.

2519
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:02,720
It's not the same experience.
It's freaking people out.

2520
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:07,840
It is.
I had a similar experience to you with 

2521
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:07,840
the.
With the play in the woods.

2522
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,680
We call it spank mountain.
Everybody did do.

2523
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:11,690
That's where they were.
Everybody found them in the woods,

2524
01:55:11,691 --> 01:55:16,691
man.
Either that or you found them in like 

2525
01:55:16,691 --> 01:55:18,880
your friend's Dad's garage.
It looks magazines tucked in the corner 

2526
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:21,930
and some fucking fire hazard situation.
Dude,

2527
01:55:21,931 --> 01:55:26,931
my buddy once traded a playboy for a gun
magazine saying there was more nudes in 

2528
01:55:26,931 --> 01:55:31,091
it and I did it and I like looked 
through every fucking page and he was 

2529
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:31,370
just waves.
I'm like,

2530
01:55:32,350 --> 01:55:34,430
are you sure?
Like I was that naive.

2531
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:35,630
Oh,
that's so funny.

2532
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,670
Yeah,
because it's like they couldn't exit the

2533
01:55:37,671 --> 01:55:42,671
browser so they would have to like 
physically put it in their heads when 

2534
01:55:42,671 --> 01:55:45,851
they,
when they were disgusted at what they 

2535
01:55:45,851 --> 01:55:45,851
whacked do.

2536
01:55:45,851 --> 01:55:47,740
When I was 20,
one of my friends found a got a hold of 

2537
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:50,000
one of those videos of women having sex 
with animals.

2538
01:55:50,030 --> 01:55:52,440
It was like a barnyard betty or 
something like that.

2539
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:55,710
And it was a vhs tapes,
real scratchy,

2540
01:55:55,711 --> 01:55:58,360
fucked up copy of a copy of a copy.
Vhs.

2541
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:01,560
Shame dripping with Shay.
So weird man.

2542
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:03,540
So weird.
I remember all of us,

2543
01:56:03,541 --> 01:56:04,650
you know,
just becoming men,

2544
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:05,640
you know,
20 years old,

2545
01:56:05,641 --> 01:56:09,240
sitting there watching it over.
I think it was someone's dad,

2546
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,960
someone's parents house watching this 
fucking video going,

2547
01:56:12,961 --> 01:56:15,660
what are we even seen here?
It was crazy.

2548
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:21,450
My brother mislabeled,
Debbie does Dallas robocop and I was 

2549
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:24,870
like robocop and I just watched people 
fuck for like an hour and I was like,

2550
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:28,080
what the like,
it was so intense.

2551
01:56:28,081 --> 01:56:30,150
I still remember those feelings of being
like,

2552
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:35,510
it wasn't like a rousell.
It was like arousal plus fear plus just 

2553
01:56:35,941 --> 01:56:36,770
confusion.

2554
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:37,610
Fusion.
Yeah.

2555
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:39,930
Coming out of a winner.
I was like,

2556
01:56:39,931 --> 01:56:44,931
what the fuck is this?
Also like you never really seen people 

2557
01:56:44,931 --> 01:56:45,960
fuck before.
It's just like whoa.

2558
01:56:45,961 --> 01:56:47,960
That's how they do it.
Like watch it,

2559
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:51,960
go in and watch them kiss is a flop and 
Ooh,

2560
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,870
this is crazy.
And that was before fake tits.

2561
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:56,700
Right.
A lot of women didn't have.

2562
01:56:56,701 --> 01:56:59,370
They had natural breast back then.
Yeah.

2563
01:56:59,371 --> 01:57:02,400
And that Bush to Bush,
that asshole hair as well.

2564
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:07,520
Chaos down there.
That's why everything's a balance in 

2565
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:07,520
order,
man.

2566
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,180
Well it was.
As soon as people started looking at 

2567
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:11,180
porn,
they started,

2568
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:11,180
oh,
we could fix this and clean this up,

2569
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:13,680
need to hacked this off,
put this over there,

2570
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:17,460
and we need to make these bigger gear.
That efficiency guy.

2571
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:18,810
I was like,
God God,

2572
01:57:18,811 --> 01:57:19,860
it's pretty good.
The tits bigger,

2573
01:57:19,861 --> 01:57:21,600
going to clean that up.
We're going to sell some product.

2574
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:23,220
Yeah.
We brought in a cleaner.

2575
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:27,420
A guy comes in like a Alec Baldwin in 
Glengarry Glen Ross.

2576
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,910
Who's that good coffee trim trim?
Yeah.

2577
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:34,260
Yeah.
They changed the whole game.

2578
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:39,770
The dead kids today.
I bet they have way more sex too with 

2579
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:42,711
like tinder and all those things.
All those ways they can interact with 

2580
01:57:42,711 --> 01:57:42,720
each other like dating apps and shit.
See,

2581
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:44,940
I want to know or maybe they're bored of
it.

2582
01:57:44,941 --> 01:57:49,941
Like it's so easy that they can't.
I think they're fucking up a storm 

2583
01:57:49,941 --> 01:57:49,941
really.
But is it like apathetic?

2584
01:57:49,941 --> 01:57:54,621
Like they didn't earn it?
It's like a trust fund versus burning 

2585
01:57:54,621 --> 01:57:54,621
it.
Oh,

2586
01:57:54,621 --> 01:57:54,621
for sure.
Yeah.

2587
01:57:54,621 --> 01:57:55,590
It's not like us.
Like we had to go hunt for it.

2588
01:57:55,591 --> 01:57:56,200
Hunt.
Yeah.

2589
01:57:56,201 --> 01:57:57,120
Yeah.
To get up early,

2590
01:57:57,150 --> 01:58:02,150
you know,
you gotta make your coffee by the 

2591
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:02,150
firelight.
I was a paper boy,

2592
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:02,150
man.
I was.

2593
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:02,880
I was getting.
I was saving money,

2594
01:58:02,881 --> 01:58:06,120
buying stocks,
snowing today.

2595
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:11,180
These kids just swipe right and fuck 
that said there is no stage show up 

2596
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:14,241
places man.
And this cure for almost every disease 

2597
01:58:14,241 --> 01:58:14,241
now.
It's also an issue,

2598
01:58:14,241 --> 01:58:18,250
you know,
didn't even have to worry about warts 

2599
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:18,250
anymore,
just get shot up.

2600
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:19,560
But that vaccine does that work?
It doesn't have fuck girls up though.

2601
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:21,960
I think it's bad for girls.
The vaccine,

2602
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:27,640
the vaccine really,
but I guess it's probably like the 

2603
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:27,920
circumcision thing.
It's like 100 to 100.

2604
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:31,890
Probably a similar number.
Nothing's perfect man.

2605
01:58:31,891 --> 01:58:33,270
That's a problem.
It's all.

2606
01:58:33,271 --> 01:58:36,360
It's okay as an order man.
Exactly.

2607
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:39,450
Chaos and order and there's no water.
It's all chaos.

2608
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:42,400
There's order for moments.
There's attended or.

2609
01:58:42,401 --> 01:58:47,401
Yeah.
It's only in like bleep brief little 

2610
01:58:47,401 --> 01:58:49,801
areas.
Brief little patches of time and small 

2611
01:58:49,801 --> 01:58:49,801
areas.
Yeah.

2612
01:58:49,801 --> 01:58:49,980
It's like the joker and Batman.
Like the joker's,

2613
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:52,330
like the progressive where it's eye 
exams era and he's like,

2614
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,010
you're fucking confusing.

2615
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:55,510
May you know.
It's like order and chaos.

2616
01:58:55,511 --> 01:58:57,820
Not Big Batman Fan.
You don't back down.

2617
01:58:57,880 --> 01:59:00,160
Ben Affleck became Batman.
I've never watched that one.

2618
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:03,250
I've always hated that guy.
I don't hate the guy.

2619
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:04,750
I don't know.
It's a strong word,

2620
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:07,900
but I've always instinctively not liked 
him.

2621
01:59:07,901 --> 01:59:12,901
He seems like the type of guy that would
work out and then like pretend you 

2622
01:59:12,901 --> 01:59:13,450
worked out harder than he did and I'm 
talking about.

2623
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:15,170
Yeah,
I know that guy and that guy,

2624
01:59:15,171 --> 01:59:18,700
like we worked out fucking hard today.
Like did you really?

2625
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:22,610
Is that guy did 10 shrugs?
I did a farmer's walk or twenties.

2626
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:24,280
No disrespect to him.
He's a great actor.

2627
01:59:24,281 --> 01:59:25,870
He's been awesome.
A lot of movies.

2628
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:30,930
I liked the guy,
but as Batman and like you just had 

2629
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:32,200
Christian Bale who looked like a real 
batman comes jacked.

2630
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:34,600
Shredded.
I believed him.

2631
01:59:34,930 --> 01:59:36,460
I believe he was out there fighting 
crime,

2632
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,920
I think.
I think good will hunting was so good.

2633
01:59:38,921 --> 01:59:41,410
It made me not like him.
I don't.

2634
01:59:41,411 --> 01:59:44,050
I can't explain it.
He was something about me I don't like.

2635
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:49,140
It's got to be something about me.
He established that he was really good 

2636
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:49,300
in that recent movie.
What's that?

2637
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:51,160
Recently the girl?
No,

2638
01:59:51,161 --> 01:59:51,940
no,
not that one.

2639
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:57,210
Where the girl was a murderer.
What the fucks are called gone girl gone

2640
01:59:58,290 --> 01:59:59,040
girl.
Ooh.

2641
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:01,000
He was good and that it's a great movie.
He was.

2642
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:01,400
He was.

2643
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:06,160
What'd you find out?
He did a nap in Batman.

2644
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:11,220
I brought this up to you as it's like a 
joke or as he's showing his abs in the 

2645
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,100
movies,
he's directing your CGI abs.

2646
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:15,200
Oh,
that didn't work out.

2647
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,500
How can you tell?
Did you see that?

2648
02:00:17,501 --> 02:00:19,390
You can see the lines here.
You don't see them here.

2649
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:21,940
These are side by side.
See anything in the right hand side.

2650
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:23,980
Not Try it.
I'll get it in motion here.

2651
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,270
Yeah.
Now,

2652
02:00:25,271 --> 02:00:29,330
side by side.
He's got it.

2653
02:00:29,370 --> 02:00:31,350
Well,
you can see over a six bag here.

2654
02:00:31,351 --> 02:00:33,080
This show them again at the beginning 
to,

2655
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:36,870
here's Ben Affleck without CGI abs.
Let's see.

2656
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,510
I'm not saying shit.
Well,

2657
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:41,420
you just.
It's a quick.

2658
02:00:41,421 --> 02:00:44,800
It's a really quick cut.
It's a.

2659
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:45,940
it's a defined six pack.

2660
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:50,590
This seems like Hayton.
Here's what the problem with this is.

2661
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:55,300
In one view,
you're not going to have abs because the

2662
02:00:55,301 --> 02:00:58,030
guy's core wasn't engaged in the other 
view.

2663
02:00:58,031 --> 02:01:00,100
The guy's doing a chin up and its core 
is engaged.

2664
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:03,520
You fucking nerds don't even know what 
apps are,

2665
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:07,730
so shut out.
Unless you're willing to earn those abs,

2666
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:09,670
engage the core.
No more sugar.

2667
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:14,700
I don't.
I he looked thin enough and fit enough 

2668
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:14,700
that I could imagine him having that six
pack.

2669
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:16,030
I don't think it's CGI,
but good for him.

2670
02:01:16,031 --> 02:01:18,810
If it is,
people love to be hating it.

2671
02:01:19,060 --> 02:01:19,890
Heda.
Well,

2672
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:24,550
it's ever since 300 men ever been since.
Everybody's like Joe that Gerard guys,

2673
02:01:24,551 --> 02:01:25,660
fucking Jack.

2674
02:01:28,090 --> 02:01:29,590
He was the most Jack Guy that ever 
lived.

2675
02:01:29,591 --> 02:01:31,450
He's like a fucking.
Just like Frank Zane,

2676
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:34,430
when he was competing in the Arnold 
Classic Right Walker,

2677
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,780
like fight club member fight club like 
that was really ripped.

2678
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:40,010
Well that was Brad Pitt was super ripped
back then,

2679
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:41,990
but that was 100 percent real.
Like he wasn't.

2680
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:44,880
There was no cgi and back then they 
weren't that shit.

2681
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:46,310
I don't think they could do that back 
then.

2682
02:01:46,311 --> 02:01:48,440
Could they?
How long ago was fight club?

2683
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:51,760
90 nine ish.
Yeah.

2684
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:54,150
They couldn't really do see John bodies 
like.

2685
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:56,840
Oh,
so Butler was CGI apps?

2686
02:01:57,740 --> 02:02:00,500
Yes.
Interesting brush to a little bit like.

2687
02:02:00,501 --> 02:02:02,000
Yeah,
they just painted them.

2688
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:04,280
They basically painted the shit out of 
their whole body.

2689
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:06,020
I'd go with that though if given the 
option,

2690
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,180
if someone's like,
we got a pink guy.

2691
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:08,960
I'm like,
yeah,

2692
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:13,990
the movie though,
I mean kind of demanded it because the 

2693
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:17,801
movie was just fantastic visual 
masterpiece where I don't think you 

2694
02:02:17,801 --> 02:02:20,120
would have been thrown off of people at 
regular bodies,

2695
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:25,150
like I 100 percent support it in that 
movie because like xerxes was like 10 

2696
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:30,131
feet tall member like the,
the Persian king and then all the other 

2697
02:02:30,131 --> 02:02:32,720
people,
like everyone was totally jacked.

2698
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:36,680
It was perfect because it was like very 
much like one of those um,

2699
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:42,230
illustrated books like a comic strip or 
high end graphic novel come to life.

2700
02:02:42,231 --> 02:02:43,580
It was perfect.
I thought it was great.

2701
02:02:43,581 --> 02:02:44,870
Yeah.
Because if everyone looked normal,

2702
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:47,750
it would just be like sad.
300 guys dying.

2703
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:50,690
Even if they were in shape,
if they looked like real people that are

2704
02:02:50,691 --> 02:02:51,440
in shape,
you know,

2705
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:54,710
some people have different body types.
Some people you don't see them.

2706
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:59,740
Even if they're like fader,
you don't see him with abs even though 

2707
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:00,080
he's like a big power guy.
There's,

2708
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:02,060
that's like,
that's the reality of humans.

2709
02:03:02,061 --> 02:03:04,100
There's a bunch of different kinds of 
body types triggered.

2710
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:09,540
There was like archetypal.
They wanted to make these like comic 

2711
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:09,540
beautifully.
Perfect man.

2712
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:13,420
They nailed it.
They did not make these movies the shit 

2713
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:14,310
he never saw.
The second one maybe there once Gerard's

2714
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:14,870
dead.
I'm like,

2715
02:03:14,871 --> 02:03:16,280
why am I watching this?
The rise of the.

2716
02:03:16,630 --> 02:03:17,280
Yeah.
No,

2717
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,560
that's.
You got to go with your ride.

2718
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:21,470
You can't fucking.
Maybe you have a prequel bitch.

2719
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:22,910
Don't make a,
you know,

2720
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,770
before they got the last Saturday.
I mean,

2721
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:30,790
could you have like a bunch of 
adventures this guy had before he got 

2722
02:03:30,790 --> 02:03:30,790
killed?
Yes.

2723
02:03:30,790 --> 02:03:33,560
You had a child that just fighting that 
cat and the fucking cave.

2724
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:38,620
Yeah.
And once he gets cocky and he wants too 

2725
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:38,620
much money,
you go with him as a teenager.

2726
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:38,620
You got a new guy?
Yeah.

2727
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:38,920
Assembly.

2728
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:44,270
Get some young dude.
Some young boy band type care.

2729
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:46,400
But that has to be the end.
The end.

2730
02:03:46,450 --> 02:03:47,720
Yeah.
Going past that.

2731
02:03:47,721 --> 02:03:50,270
It's just justin bieber stars in it.
He's 20 years old.

2732
02:03:50,271 --> 02:03:52,520
He can get in there to give them some 
fucking fake abs.

2733
02:03:52,530 --> 02:03:57,530
Get the demo in there and how much pussy
Justin bieber would get if they did 

2734
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:57,530
that,
like it would be unmanageable.

2735
02:03:57,530 --> 02:04:02,320
He already is probably limited,
whereas this Jimmy simulation of what 

2736
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:04,310
that would looked like with the 300 guys
versus $20,000.

2737
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:06,320
So this is.
So this really did happen.

2738
02:04:06,321 --> 02:04:11,321
There really was 300 guys.
A lot of hate crimes happening right 

2739
02:04:11,321 --> 02:04:11,900
there.
300 guys.

2740
02:04:11,901 --> 02:04:14,290
And how many thousand version?
20,000.

2741
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:15,620
20,000
Persians holders.

2742
02:04:15,621 --> 02:04:17,360
Well that's not right.
It doesn't look right.

2743
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:20,650
That doesn't move guys.
Oh my God.

2744
02:04:20,651 --> 02:04:22,460
It's so insane.
That's why they called him at mortals.

2745
02:04:22,461 --> 02:04:27,461
Right?
Because they just kept coming back 

2746
02:04:27,461 --> 02:04:27,461
there.
So many of them.

2747
02:04:27,461 --> 02:04:27,980
You would have to be so good to beat all
their asses.

2748
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:30,080
They're probably beating their own 
assets,

2749
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:31,700
waiting to get in on you.
You.

2750
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:34,950
This is blowing my mind.
This is stable.

2751
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:36,920
That's a phish concert.

2752
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:41,430
Smells just as bad,
but it kind.

2753
02:04:41,431 --> 02:04:45,420
But over there I didn't do it.
Oh,

2754
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:49,980
look at that.
So insane.

2755
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:53,130
Carlin did a good job with that one.
The king of kings series.

2756
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:58,490
Yeah.
Dan Carlin does a great job with 

2757
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:00,241
everything,
but this is really is insane that this 

2758
02:05:00,241 --> 02:05:02,040
happened,
that they really did try to hold off all

2759
02:05:02,041 --> 02:05:03,630
these people.
Holy Fuck.

2760
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,770
What a sea of humans,
and it's not fair because they're fresh.

2761
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:09,360
By the time they get to you,
you're.

2762
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:12,420
You're already beat down.
You fought killed seven dudes already,

2763
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:13,250
but now,
yeah.

2764
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:15,750
Now you have high ground just with 
bodies.

2765
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:19,530
Yay.
A little bit about this in your life.

2766
02:05:19,950 --> 02:05:21,380
This is just computer simulations.
Yeah.

2767
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:23,040
Nobody knows.
Nobody has an idea.

2768
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:24,170
See,
that's how naive I am.

2769
02:05:24,171 --> 02:05:25,620
I'm literally just buying it like I'm 
like,

2770
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:28,530
Oh shit.
This is exactly it.

2771
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:30,170
I had this super stoner

2772
02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:35,310
idea.
Once that one day they would come out 

2773
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:39,660
with a computer that is so powerful that
it calculates the position.

2774
02:05:39,911 --> 02:05:44,911
This would have to be dependent upon a 
bunch of other technologies that are 

2775
02:05:44,911 --> 02:05:46,450
new,
like specifically the ability to monitor

2776
02:05:46,451 --> 02:05:51,451
every single thing on earth in high 
definition and then put all that 

2777
02:05:51,451 --> 02:05:55,831
information to some crazy supercomputer 
so you look at every object that is in 

2778
02:05:55,831 --> 02:05:59,370
every position,
wherever it is and somehow or another 

2779
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:03,061
they could figure out how everything got
there and through some super powerful ai

2780
02:06:04,121 --> 02:06:07,990
that's hasn't even been invented yet.
They would literally be able to recreate

2781
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:12,220
every single moment that happened that 
led to that happening right there.

2782
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:14,710
Like you get the math and just go 
backwards.

2783
02:06:14,830 --> 02:06:16,150
Either.
We realized at one point,

2784
02:06:16,151 --> 02:06:18,190
this is a super stoner idea that I don't
think is real.

2785
02:06:18,191 --> 02:06:20,230
Folks.
You're so fucking stupid.

2786
02:06:20,231 --> 02:06:21,370
You understand how time works.

2787
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:23,090
That's not what I mean,
but my.

2788
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:26,260
This is my super stoner idea was that 
they would figure it out.

2789
02:06:26,261 --> 02:06:31,261
Computers that are so impossibly 
powerful and they can calculate and 

2790
02:06:31,261 --> 02:06:35,251
extrapolate and do this crazy sort of 
some sort of algorithm that figures out 

2791
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:43,700
exactly how everything got to wherever 
it is and that you could recreate in 

2792
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:46,080
some sort of visual form everything 
that's ever happened ever.

2793
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:48,450
I think that's possible.
Theoretically,

2794
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:53,510
we're both so high.
We shouldn't be talking about this 

2795
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:54,450
publicly.
We totally possible,

2796
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:57,450
but we'll never get there if we keep 
hiring 50 slash 50 gender.

2797
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:00,210
I'm just kidding.
Oh my God.

2798
02:07:00,211 --> 02:07:02,790
You're a misogynist.
I'm only kidding.

2799
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:06,180
I saw a lot of people that said that guy
was a misogynist.

2800
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:09,660
That's.
That's like calling everybody in Nazi.

2801
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:15,080
He can't do that.
You've got to be careful because then 

2802
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:16,350
you see a real Nazi and it's a,
it's a different thing.

2803
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:17,300
It's like,
um,

2804
02:07:17,430 --> 02:07:20,550
the issue that I have with 10,
nine rounds in mma sometimes at 10,

2805
02:07:20,551 --> 02:07:25,551
nine round dude,
get the fuck beat out of them and other 

2806
02:07:25,551 --> 02:07:25,551
times a 10,
nine round and it could be either one,

2807
02:07:25,551 --> 02:07:27,060
I can't have,
it's not the same thing.

2808
02:07:27,061 --> 02:07:30,660
You gotta you gotTa have a new name for 
it and that's sort of how I feel.

2809
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:33,320
Terrible explanation,
terrible comparison rather.

2810
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:38,480
But that's what I think about people 
calling someone a massage and it's like 

2811
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:38,480
a massage just to someone who hates 
women.

2812
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:42,640
If someone writes a page and a half of 
different ideas of how you can encourage

2813
02:07:43,841 --> 02:07:47,470
women to get into tech and so they will 
be more represented that you know,

2814
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:51,100
like make it more interesting for them 
or ways to get them in.

2815
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,640
That's not a misogynist.
It's the opposite of a misogynist.

2816
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:58,750
I mean,
just because someone doesn't tow the 

2817
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:01,890
current lefty liberal line,
it doesn't mean that you're a 

2818
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:01,890
misogynist.

2819
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:02,080
You gotta think about what this is 
saying.

2820
02:08:02,410 --> 02:08:04,270
No one's saying women can't do 
something.

2821
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:06,400
No one's saying women are less 
qualified.

2822
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:10,360
What he's saying is that women are more 
inclined to choose different things.

2823
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:15,480
That's it,
and this is supported by science and it 

2824
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:17,150
doesn't mean you hate women.
If you think that the reason why there's

2825
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:22,170
whatever the percentage is 10 percent or
15 percent or 20 percent of women in 

2826
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:22,170
tech,
if that's,

2827
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:24,670
if that's that way,
just because 20 percent of the women who

2828
02:08:24,671 --> 02:08:28,150
decide to go into college and decided to
pursue a career are interested in it.

2829
02:08:28,410 --> 02:08:33,410
If that's.
If it's any other reason we need to 

2830
02:08:33,410 --> 02:08:33,410
examine it,
but if it's that reason,

2831
02:08:33,410 --> 02:08:35,260
then we should just kind of accept it 
for what it is and try to make it easier

2832
02:08:35,261 --> 02:08:37,630
for those women that worked there.
I don't know how the fuck to do that.

2833
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:42,630
I don't work in an office,
but I would imagine there's got to be 

2834
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:42,630
ways,
you know,

2835
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:44,890
I would imagine just treat people with 
respect,

2836
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:49,980
you know,
figuring out a way to make that a 

2837
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:53,101
priority in your office or a part of 
your business or the culture of your 

2838
02:08:53,101 --> 02:08:53,101
community.
Yeah.

2839
02:08:53,101 --> 02:08:54,040
Just focus on the individual,
not the group.

2840
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:54,850
Yeah.
You can't.

2841
02:08:54,851 --> 02:08:59,851
Yeah.
All girls and all boys that those 

2842
02:08:59,851 --> 02:08:59,851
things.
It's like all white people.

2843
02:08:59,851 --> 02:09:01,180
That does not end well.
It doesn't end well.

2844
02:09:01,181 --> 02:09:03,460
It's not a good way to differentiate 
whether you like someone to.

2845
02:09:03,461 --> 02:09:08,170
Not if it's all girl or all boy or all 
white or all black or all anything.

2846
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:12,190
You got to be open to possibilities.
Especially when you're not saying like,

2847
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:14,890
you know,
I need a fucking.

2848
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:17,650
A large white power lifter.
Well you got to go to Iceland,

2849
02:09:17,700 --> 02:09:18,730
you know,
gay stuff with them.

2850
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:21,040
Iceland dudes know that's not being 
discriminatory.

2851
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:22,810
It's like you've got very specific 
needs.

2852
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:23,710
Oh yeah.
Those dudes.

2853
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:26,080
You got to go to the north.
I needed Norwegian.

2854
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:26,670
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2855
02:09:26,671 --> 02:09:29,250
You got to go to Norway.
Rico guy.

2856
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:29,920
Yeah.
You got to need.

2857
02:09:29,921 --> 02:09:31,870
You need one of those dudes that works 
at Didgeridoo.

2858
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:32,980
Oh,
you got to go to Australia.

2859
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,660
Have you read a sports gene by 
abstained?

2860
02:09:36,420 --> 02:09:37,150
No.
Habit.

2861
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,260
No.
Haven't read that.

2862
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:40,180
But there's,
there's like when it comes to sports,

2863
02:09:40,181 --> 02:09:41,710
it's so obvious.
Yeah.

2864
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:46,860
Where it's like there's one area of 
Kenya where like all the winners of 

2865
02:09:46,860 --> 02:09:49,270
every marathon come from,
but on the individual basis,

2866
02:09:49,271 --> 02:09:51,310
it doesn't mean anything.
You know,

2867
02:09:51,311 --> 02:09:54,850
like Cameron hanes would beat 99 point 
nine,

2868
02:09:54,851 --> 02:09:55,290
nine,
nine,

2869
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:57,730
nine percent of black people in long 
distance running,

2870
02:09:57,731 --> 02:09:59,680
but the that you'd have to get really 
long.

2871
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:04,330
You can see those little skinny African 
dudes that when marathons.

2872
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:09,360
Those guys are beasts,
you cannot fuck with those guys when it 

2873
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:12,571
comes to running a marathon.
Those skinny dudes like that is the 

2874
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:13,930
build for marathons and Cam's never 
going to beat those guys,

2875
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:18,640
but you put them on a mountain where 
they got to go up like 9,000

2876
02:10:18,641 --> 02:10:20,920
feet of elevation and it's a three day 
run.

2877
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:24,190
He leaves all those motherfuckers in the
dirt because it's a different built.

2878
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:26,700
Like his build is a muscle build to the 
keys.

2879
02:10:26,701 --> 02:10:31,701
A built guy who does endurance sports 
and that's like a lot of the mountain 

2880
02:10:31,701 --> 02:10:35,551
runners,
like a lot of the people that do those 

2881
02:10:35,551 --> 02:10:35,551
crazy,
like the bigfoot 200.

2882
02:10:35,551 --> 02:10:38,330
There's a massive amount of travel and 
elevation up and down.

2883
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:44,020
You have to be strong.
It's not like it's not just flat ground 

2884
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:44,510
and if you're like a really good flat 
ground runner,

2885
02:10:44,511 --> 02:10:47,570
it's a totally different build.
Their real skinny and it's for them it's

2886
02:10:47,571 --> 02:10:50,510
just about efficiency in motion and just
mad cardio.

2887
02:10:50,610 --> 02:10:52,890
Yeah.
It's also like a oxygen consumption.

2888
02:10:52,891 --> 02:10:57,891
Like that's why warm,
wet air wide nostrils you crush,

2889
02:10:58,860 --> 02:11:02,880
but like if you're in,
you know where he's racing with dry cold

2890
02:11:02,881 --> 02:11:04,290
air,
you need a lot more surface area.

2891
02:11:04,291 --> 02:11:07,080
That's how you have these tight noses 
and saying something like that.

2892
02:11:07,081 --> 02:11:07,590
Someone say,
oh,

2893
02:11:07,591 --> 02:11:10,230
roses you like,
now that's just a fact.

2894
02:11:10,270 --> 02:11:10,720
You know?

2895
02:11:11,070 --> 02:11:16,070
It's just,
is it racist to the black guys have big 

2896
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:19,010
dicks.
I can't be racist if it's good.

2897
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:22,430
Right?
Isn't that the question?

2898
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:26,120
That has been a question that has been.
Is it a racial stereotype?

2899
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:31,170
Maybe.
Maybe it's triggering to guys who have 

2900
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:31,610
regular sized dicks that's black,
that's who suffer with girls are psyched

2901
02:11:31,611 --> 02:11:33,590
to like finally get me a black one,
whoo.

2902
02:11:33,591 --> 02:11:38,591
Can't wait for this ride.
And then it's like you take that goofy 

2903
02:11:38,591 --> 02:11:38,591
ride at Disney.
It's like,

2904
02:11:38,591 --> 02:11:39,290
Oh God,
you know,

2905
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:40,710
you have kids.
Take them to Disney.

2906
02:11:40,711 --> 02:11:43,760
It like a one roller coaster,
like goofy's really cool,

2907
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:50,760
like you're ready for that fucking 
California screaming when you go upside 

2908
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:51,050
down and it doesn't happen.

2909
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:51,730
Yeah.
It just hurts.

2910
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:54,130
Like it's like an Asian with a hammer or
it's like,

2911
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:56,470
oh,
this is a really good personality.

2912
02:11:56,471 --> 02:11:58,300
Oh my God.
He is a monster in his pants.

2913
02:11:58,570 --> 02:12:01,450
Like he's just constantly breaking 
stereotypes in a good way.

2914
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:06,840
Know.
It's like the opposite for me with 

2915
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:07,000
basketball first pick suck.
It's like big man.

2916
02:12:07,001 --> 02:12:08,230
I'm like,
don't do it.

2917
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:09,250
No,
it's a bad call.

2918
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:16,250
Just don't do constant let down,
but when you got to like the five to 

2919
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:18,090
Muggsy bogues guy,
it's like he's the greatest and I'm just

2920
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:18,730
a let down.

2921
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,100
Yeah,
it's,

2922
02:12:20,370 --> 02:12:22,370
you know,
there's a bunch of people that are going

2923
02:12:22,371 --> 02:12:27,371
to be better at things in you,
whether it's better at math or it's 

2924
02:12:27,371 --> 02:12:32,360
better at music or it's better at 
whatever the fuck it is and there's 

2925
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:35,331
going to be a bunch of people have all 
sorts of genders that are better than 

2926
02:12:35,331 --> 02:12:36,210
you at it and all sorts of ethnicities 
and all.

2927
02:12:36,211 --> 02:12:40,270
They come from all sorts of different 
parts of the planet and it's just,

2928
02:12:40,271 --> 02:12:42,780
it's not fair.
There's no fair involved.

2929
02:12:42,810 --> 02:12:43,350
No.
Fair.

2930
02:12:43,351 --> 02:12:43,930
It's not,
it's.

2931
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:46,470
I know it sucks.
I know it feels weird,

2932
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:51,530
but there's no fair involved in European
Jews winning more Nobel prizes than 

2933
02:12:52,471 --> 02:12:55,260
anybody.
There's no fear involved in that is like

2934
02:12:55,261 --> 02:13:00,261
what are they doing?
Like how fucking smarter than like 

2935
02:13:00,261 --> 02:13:02,750
what's going on here?
Like this is a crazy group of smart 

2936
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:02,750
people.

2937
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:02,750
Yeah.
Crazy smart.

2938
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:03,570
Also culture,
you know,

2939
02:13:03,670 --> 02:13:07,680
that's like black redneck,
white liberals when my favorite books by

2940
02:13:07,690 --> 02:13:11,460
Thomas Soul and like culture is 
everything,

2941
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:16,520
you know,
and a lot of it has to do with whether 

2942
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,111
or not you heard it animals or,
or had a farm and that's the size of 

2943
02:13:18,111 --> 02:13:21,201
government you want or it's like it's 
the same with like certain Chinese 

2944
02:13:21,201 --> 02:13:24,070
people can count so well and they're so 
good at math because they just,

2945
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:24,910
they,
it's,

2946
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:25,500
it's one,
two,

2947
02:13:25,501 --> 02:13:25,860
three,
four,

2948
02:13:25,861 --> 02:13:26,700
five and then 10,
one,

2949
02:13:26,701 --> 02:13:27,030
10,
two,

2950
02:13:27,031 --> 02:13:27,510
10,
three.

2951
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:29,160
So they never had 13,
14,

2952
02:13:29,161 --> 02:13:31,880
15.
That set us back a and that like

2953
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:36,270
starts snowballing.
Same with like rice farming.

2954
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:41,570
It's all about efficiency because it's 
year round and you have like a little 

2955
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:44,601
amount of land and then like,
so that makes you a little more 

2956
02:13:44,601 --> 02:13:45,030
efficient as a culture and that's not 
racial.

2957
02:13:45,031 --> 02:13:47,520
It just means like you guys value 
different shit.

2958
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:52,020
Yeah,
I mean you gotta wonder how much of what

2959
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:57,080
a person is in 2017.
How much of it has to do with all sorts 

2960
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:02,070
of factors and influences that are 
completely out of your control and if,

2961
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,440
if a lot of it,
I'm,

2962
02:14:03,441 --> 02:14:08,441
I'm inclined to believe it's most,
almost all of it has to do with things 

2963
02:14:08,441 --> 02:14:12,171
that are out of your control.
Like why would you think that we'd be a 

2964
02:14:12,171 --> 02:14:16,371
good idea to be aligned with a group of 
one people that have one thing in 

2965
02:14:17,371 --> 02:14:22,371
common,
like you're white or you're black or 

2966
02:14:22,371 --> 02:14:22,371
whatever the fuck you are.

2967
02:14:22,371 --> 02:14:23,910
It's.
It isn't.

2968
02:14:24,090 --> 02:14:29,090
It's a holdover from ancient times.
When we were tribal and we were worried 

2969
02:14:29,090 --> 02:14:31,320
about being invaded and everybody's 
thinking,

2970
02:14:31,321 --> 02:14:32,070
well,
there they are.

2971
02:14:32,071 --> 02:14:34,590
Invading the art.
Taken away our culture,

2972
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:35,910
taken away our history.
Like,

2973
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:39,060
just fucking relax.
All right.

2974
02:14:39,061 --> 02:14:40,380
No one's taken away.
Shit,

2975
02:14:40,650 --> 02:14:42,510
you can't take away history,
first of all,

2976
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:45,000
it's not like people are going to forget
and second of all,

2977
02:14:45,150 --> 02:14:47,790
like you're not here for very long,
man.

2978
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:53,240
This is a short time.
You're wasting your time thinking about 

2979
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:54,960
some stupid shit you if you are fucking 
super lucky.

2980
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:58,170
You got a hundred years on this rock,
100.

2981
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:00,840
And we're also externalizing pride.
Yeah.

2982
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:02,340
Where it's like,
oh,

2983
02:15:02,341 --> 02:15:05,850
I need trump to say this or I feel shame
or pride.

2984
02:15:05,851 --> 02:15:08,940
It's like it should stem from your own 
accomplishments and yourself,

2985
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:10,860
you know,
like pride,

2986
02:15:11,010 --> 02:15:13,140
like what do you have pride in?
You know what I'm saying?

2987
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:14,670
Happy.
You did something difficult.

2988
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:16,260
You.
That's probably where it ends.

2989
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,720
You know,
she'd be happy that you're a good person

2990
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:19,420
and uh,
you know,

2991
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,920
you should be happy that uh,
you,

2992
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:25,930
you have a lot of friends and that you 
enjoy each other's company and you can 

2993
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:27,900
make them happy and they can make you 
happy and that you enjoy seeing them.

2994
02:15:27,901 --> 02:15:30,500
You should be happy about 
accomplishments and you know,

2995
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:34,380
good interactions that you successfully 
navigated through with people that maybe

2996
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:36,030
could have gone badly.
You know,

2997
02:15:36,031 --> 02:15:38,880
those are always great.
It's always good feelings when clear the

2998
02:15:38,881 --> 02:15:43,881
air with somebody and you give a big hug
at the end of it and everybody feels 

2999
02:15:43,881 --> 02:15:43,881
better because those are things to be 
happy about.

3000
02:15:44,130 --> 02:15:49,130
But people are happy about stupid shit.
You're happy about what you both like 

3001
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:49,130
swastikas.
So as fuck.

3002
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,690
How about those dudes showed up with 
guns.

3003
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:56,870
They showed up with guns like full,
full on open carry walking the street 

3004
02:15:56,870 --> 02:16:00,450
with military outfits on flak jackets,
machine guns showing up.

3005
02:16:00,451 --> 02:16:02,430
What while they're taking down this 
fucking statue?

3006
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:03,350
Yeah,
it's,

3007
02:16:03,351 --> 02:16:05,280
it's a,
it's definitely a form of mental illness

3008
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:10,310
where it's like you're living out of 
trauma that it doesn't really apply to 

3009
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:10,310
your life.
Well,

3010
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:11,280
there's no real war for these people 
now.

3011
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:13,980
This in,
in at least where they're standing.

3012
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:16,030
So because there's no real war.
The,

3013
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:18,300
they're bringing guns and they're 
turning something.

3014
02:16:18,330 --> 02:16:21,570
The ramping up all the power and the 
pressure of this moment.

3015
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:25,320
I didn't see the,
what happened on the side of the left,

3016
02:16:25,321 --> 02:16:27,960
but I heard that they were doing some 
horrible shit to people too.

3017
02:16:28,150 --> 02:16:33,150
And um,
there a lot of punching and people are 

3018
02:16:33,150 --> 02:16:35,611
fucking beaten the shit out of each 
other and there's piles on top of each 

3019
02:16:35,611 --> 02:16:35,611
other.

3020
02:16:35,611 --> 02:16:37,840
The violence has escalated.
I have no idea who started it,

3021
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:39,100
who,
I don't know.

3022
02:16:39,130 --> 02:16:44,130
I have no idea.
I have no idea if the police were at 

3023
02:16:44,130 --> 02:16:46,261
fault.
There's a lot of people that believe 

3024
02:16:46,261 --> 02:16:46,261
that the police should have separated 
them and they did not.

3025
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:51,270
They didn't do anything about it and 
they allowed it to escalate and they 

3026
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:52,180
just stood back while it escalated.
Like they didn't have the power,

3027
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:56,320
the manpower to go in and enforce some 
sort of civility.

3028
02:16:56,470 --> 02:16:58,000
It's tragic.
It's horrible,

3029
02:16:58,001 --> 02:16:58,390
man.
I mean,

3030
02:16:58,391 --> 02:16:59,740
they might not have been prepared for 
it.

3031
02:16:59,741 --> 02:17:01,210
They might not have had the resources.
I mean,

3032
02:17:01,211 --> 02:17:03,010
how many fucking people are working 
there?

3033
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:05,830
I mean there's how many thousands of 
people showed up with torches.

3034
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:11,250
Yeah.
It was like the opposite of woodstock 

3035
02:17:11,250 --> 02:17:12,070
where it's like the worst possible.
Too many people.

3036
02:17:12,370 --> 02:17:14,500
And I think a lot of times people need a
purpose.

3037
02:17:14,590 --> 02:17:16,360
You know,
I'm friends with a lot of vets,

3038
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:21,640
uh,
and like they have ptsd and all this 

3039
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:25,381
stuff and,
and a lot of them just want to purpose 

3040
02:17:25,381 --> 02:17:28,470
because like idle time makes them crazy.
I think there's a lot of people right 

3041
02:17:28,470 --> 02:17:31,930
now that don't feel any purpose,
so they're like listening to chat rooms,

3042
02:17:31,931 --> 02:17:35,200
whether it's isis or Nazis or hey,
we have a purpose for you.

3043
02:17:35,201 --> 02:17:38,380
You're more than just your like,
possessions.

3044
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:41,380
And then that's when things become 
horrifying.

3045
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:42,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

3046
02:17:42,770 --> 02:17:45,310
And listen,
I know people get mad.

3047
02:17:45,311 --> 02:17:46,480
We're that.
We're talking about this.

3048
02:17:46,481 --> 02:17:51,481
People on both sides.
If you have a group of people and you 

3049
02:17:51,481 --> 02:17:52,900
all show up with the same torch,
you're a bunch of fucking assholes.

3050
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:55,630
Why do you have torches?
Did you get,

3051
02:17:55,690 --> 02:18:00,690
listen,
go to fucking ref stat ref rei to Joey 

3052
02:18:02,690 --> 02:18:03,790
Diaz.
Go to Rei,

3053
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:05,020
get a headlamp pro.

3054
02:18:05,130 --> 02:18:10,130
There is so much better than torches if 
you're really concerned with seeing at 

3055
02:18:10,130 --> 02:18:10,130
night.
Okay,

3056
02:18:10,130 --> 02:18:12,280
I love my headlamp.
Did this shit.

3057
02:18:12,281 --> 02:18:14,010
They have three different things.
You can make them strobes.

3058
02:18:14,011 --> 02:18:15,280
Sometimes.
I got a good one.

3059
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:17,930
I think it's a black diamond.
I think that's the name of the company I

3060
02:18:17,940 --> 02:18:22,940
wear when I go hunting.
I put that fucker on my hat and it's 

3061
02:18:22,940 --> 02:18:25,591
awesome.
I clicked that sucker and I could walk 

3062
02:18:25,591 --> 02:18:25,591
around with no problem and the batteries
and these thing,

3063
02:18:25,591 --> 02:18:26,320
they're tremendous.
They last forever.

3064
02:18:26,650 --> 02:18:31,650
Why the fuck do you need fire?
Why you pretend like some intimidation 

3065
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:33,970
tactic or you want to bring us back to 
the days,

3066
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:37,780
but we didn't have fucking electricity 
and you had to walk down the street with

3067
02:18:37,781 --> 02:18:40,060
a torch because they're almost 
intentionally being like,

3068
02:18:40,061 --> 02:18:43,320
we're backwards.
It is exactly like that.

3069
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:45,430
Headlamps,
whether they realize it or not,

3070
02:18:45,431 --> 02:18:46,930
it is fucking stupid.

3071
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:52,320
Which some bulk bulk bulk would stop.
Stop.

3072
02:18:56,801 --> 02:18:58,210
You're in a bad pattern,
man.

3073
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:00,580
You had a bad pattern.
You're not a bad person.

3074
02:19:00,581 --> 02:19:03,190
Don't get stuck in this.
Don't let this define you.

3075
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:07,990
You're just a person in any one of us 
could have got stuck in a shift pattern.

3076
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:10,600
That's all it is.
That's what being a racist is.

3077
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:12,710
It's not being a realist.
Stop.

3078
02:19:12,880 --> 02:19:17,880
There's assholes.
We have all colors and genders and 

3079
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:18,310
everything.
All persuasions.

3080
02:19:18,311 --> 02:19:21,790
There's assholes across the board and 
there's also a lot of Nice people.

3081
02:19:22,510 --> 02:19:27,510
You just gotta figure out a way to 
navigate away from the Douche bags and 

3082
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:28,010
don't be one of them,
and as soon as you show up

3083
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,150
with a fucking torch,
yellen,

3084
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:32,810
white pride,
you've taken off your shirt to show your

3085
02:19:32,811 --> 02:19:34,940
Nazi tattoo like dude,
do it.

3086
02:19:34,941 --> 02:19:39,941
The Nazi flag is literally a red flag.
It's the worst thing to do to your body 

3087
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:44,960
to show that you're a part of one of the
worst group ever.

3088
02:19:44,961 --> 02:19:46,730
In human history.
You're part of this.

3089
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:51,880
They'd randomly discriminates against 
Jews and wants to kill them and throw 

3090
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:51,880
them in ovens.
That's what they did.

3091
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:51,920
Well,
that's all what it means,

3092
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:55,760
but what it actually means,
this is you got to let that go.

3093
02:19:55,761 --> 02:19:56,870
You gotta.
Get the mustache go.

3094
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,070
You gotta.
Let the swastika go.

3095
02:19:58,230 --> 02:20:00,230
You can get by without a swastika 
tattoo.

3096
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:03,350
You really can thrive.
You can be a happy person.

3097
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:05,020
There's press my right,
my right.

3098
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:10,060
I'm supposed to be from Germany right 
before the war of the right to be part 

3099
02:20:10,551 --> 02:20:11,000
of the group.

3100
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,010
That clearly fucking sucks at 
everything.

3101
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:18,190
I didn't suck at first.
It's a good idea for some good early 

3102
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:18,200
policies.
It got out of hand.

3103
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:21,740
He built the Autobahn Bro.
You got out of hand after awhile.

3104
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:25,040
He started taking adderall right after 
they've made the nurburgring.

3105
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:28,580
Bringing those old Audi's around those 
corners.

3106
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:32,210
It's like once he made a fucking 50 mile
missile,

3107
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:34,640
it was bad.
Just wasting time.

3108
02:20:34,641 --> 02:20:37,730
They should get into bowling.
They could be in a bowl and just as much

3109
02:20:37,731 --> 02:20:41,040
during the like us history,
confederate history is important part of

3110
02:20:41,041 --> 02:20:42,800
them all up.
Bowling's everything.

3111
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:45,200
To me the same person,
same thing.

3112
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:47,230
It's so true.
Go bow hunting.

3113
02:20:47,231 --> 02:20:49,070
Now it's way more fun.
You get into a hobby.

3114
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:54,100
That's what I listen to your new hobbies
on the pod because like I'm the same 

3115
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:54,100
way.
Like I'll,

3116
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:58,390
I'll teach myself like a very hard 
beethoven song and that allows me to be 

3117
02:20:58,390 --> 02:20:59,990
like disappear and have a hobby and a 
purpose.

3118
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:05,260
Like these like goal oriented purposes.
Like listen to you talk about like 

3119
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:06,450
getting into archery and like loving it.
And I'm like,

3120
02:21:06,830 --> 02:21:11,830
you know,
the little amounts of weight on a Arrow 

3121
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:11,830
and stuff,
and I'm like,

3122
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:11,830
I need.
It.

3123
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:14,300
Reminds me of hobbies is fascinating,
man.

3124
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:19,820
All hobbies to me or the same thing in 
that what you're trying to do is try and

3125
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:25,270
focus on something and get better at it 
and get figured out what it is that 

3126
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:25,590
makes this thing good.
You know?

3127
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:27,830
It's the same thing.
It's like it's an extra.

3128
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:29,420
I mean obviously they're not the same 
activity,

3129
02:21:29,421 --> 02:21:31,490
but it's the same thing.
It's a focus.

3130
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:36,700
It's an avenue for your mind.
And I feel like it's like cross 

3131
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:40,361
training.
I feel like when you get involved in 

3132
02:21:40,361 --> 02:21:40,361
hobbies and you really get it,
as long as you manage them healthily,

3133
02:21:40,361 --> 02:21:41,300
we don't let them take over your life.

3134
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:45,950
Getting better at a thing like chess or 
Jujitsu or whatever it is,

3135
02:21:46,490 --> 02:21:49,340
gets you better at the entirety of your 
life.

3136
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:54,460
As long as you look at the entirety of 
your life in balance and you don't let 

3137
02:21:54,460 --> 02:21:56,690
it run away from you because I've let it
run away from me for a bunch of times.

3138
02:21:56,691 --> 02:21:59,390
I think we all have to stand up too.
Oh yeah.

3139
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:02,240
Like I like just learning Spanish.
I'm trying to teach myself Spanish.

3140
02:22:02,241 --> 02:22:05,750
I have a whole new 10 minutes on the 
gender of nouns like that.

3141
02:22:05,751 --> 02:22:08,360
I wouldn't have even thought of if I 
only spoke English my whole life.

3142
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:09,740
Yeah,
that's a good point.

3143
02:22:10,070 --> 02:22:10,670
That's.
Yeah.

3144
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:12,800
I mean that's another totally different 
take on things.

3145
02:22:12,801 --> 02:22:17,801
Right?
Looking at it from the point of view of 

3146
02:22:17,801 --> 02:22:19,901
like any sort of Latin art or Latin,
Latin language and Luna was down a 

3147
02:22:19,901 --> 02:22:19,970
woman.

3148
02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:24,970
Then you go through the whole thing.
It's like our language doesn't have any 

3149
02:22:24,970 --> 02:22:28,421
gender assignment.
It all I'm nouns and then for them it's 

3150
02:22:28,421 --> 02:22:31,641
everything.
You have to remember like what 

3151
02:22:31,641 --> 02:22:31,641
everything is.
If it has a dick or a pussy,

3152
02:22:31,641 --> 02:22:33,810
I wonder if they're triggered all day,
all day,

3153
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:38,870
all day.
Like everybody's like super settled as 

3154
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:41,060
gender classification.
What about non binary folks in Latin 

3155
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:42,720
countries?
They just must be spiraling.

3156
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:44,670
What about gender fluid?
Like Julio,

3157
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:48,660
you El Senor or a loss senorita.
Who are you to?

3158
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:53,770
It's like zero President Taser.
They don't buy that shit over there now 

3159
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:59,660
and they don't even think about it's fun
doing it in Pasadena and shit because 

3160
02:22:59,660 --> 02:22:59,660
it's like a lot of like,
uh,

3161
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:01,590
Mexicans haven't even thought about 
that.

3162
02:23:01,591 --> 02:23:04,950
It's just so second nature.
It's almost like having someone describe

3163
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:06,930
our culture to us and being like,
Oh shit,

3164
02:23:06,931 --> 02:23:09,240
we put silicone and chicks fucking 
boobs,

3165
02:23:09,510 --> 02:23:10,860
you know?
Well,

3166
02:23:10,861 --> 02:23:15,861
the,
but things more disturbing me for some 

3167
02:23:15,861 --> 02:23:15,861
reason.
Yeah.

3168
02:23:15,861 --> 02:23:19,460
The new trend and fake butts.
I saw a girl just two days ago at the 

3169
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:20,310
hotel.
It looked like she had a diaper on.

3170
02:23:20,690 --> 02:23:23,100
It was insane.
She was walking around by the pool.

3171
02:23:23,101 --> 02:23:25,260
I was like,
this is the craziest fucking.

3172
02:23:25,261 --> 02:23:29,550
She had some dress on and some so 
preposterously proportion to talks.

3173
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:31,020
I was like,
listen,

3174
02:23:31,021 --> 02:23:32,400
you can't just do that.

3175
02:23:34,730 --> 02:23:36,120
Can just do that.
Like,

3176
02:23:36,121 --> 02:23:38,400
what are you doing here?
This is crazy.

3177
02:23:38,410 --> 02:23:40,740
Do you think it floats.
It definitely has to.

3178
02:23:40,741 --> 02:23:42,930
If it's all fat,
the ones that are doing it now,

3179
02:23:42,931 --> 02:23:47,931
apparently what they do is fat grafting.
That's the same word I use when I 

3180
02:23:47,931 --> 02:23:52,110
describe welding fenders on a porsche.
You graft defender?

3181
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:53,730
Yeah.
They call it,

3182
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:57,390
they call it fat grafting,
so they take fat,

3183
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:59,910
the lipids you like,
they take fat again,

3184
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:04,980
one,
if they didn't tell you to get fat 

3185
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:04,980
first,
like,

3186
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:04,980
listen,
just give you an excuse up,

3187
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:06,450
just beef the fuck up,
eat a lot of pasta,

3188
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:08,950
get get crazy.
And then they like,

3189
02:24:08,951 --> 02:24:09,600
Whoa,
you.

3190
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:12,810
And then they took all that shit in your
ass.

3191
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:16,640
Just thick in that beast up.
Woo.

3192
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:18,960
And they have to,
they have to smooth it out too.

3193
02:24:18,961 --> 02:24:20,260
They don't want it too lumpy mail.

3194
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:24,030
Make sure you do a good job.
I'd probably makes air travel better.

3195
02:24:24,031 --> 02:24:25,450
Like do you think that like you're 
always so.

3196
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:27,230
Yeah,
bounce.

3197
02:24:27,510 --> 02:24:28,290
Yeah,
for sure.

3198
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:29,520
For sure.
He'd be like,

3199
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:30,810
he'd be like,
everywhere you go,

3200
02:24:30,811 --> 02:24:33,300
you're sitting on a water balloon.
Like everywhere you go,

3201
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:36,840
you're always engaging the core.
Yeah.

3202
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,540
It'd be like one of them,
a yoga bubbles are those,

3203
02:24:39,541 --> 02:24:44,541
uh,
those balloon things just sit on one of 

3204
02:24:44,541 --> 02:24:44,541
those things.
Those balls,

3205
02:24:44,541 --> 02:24:45,900
those exercise balls,
that's what it'd be like all day long.

3206
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:50,901
You sitting on a giant yoga balloon,
like swimming.

3207
02:24:53,671 --> 02:24:55,530
I feel like you drown.
Like you're an acid.

3208
02:24:55,560 --> 02:25:00,560
Just be like a buoy buoys and just women
that drowned because they've asked,

3209
02:25:01,201 --> 02:25:02,760
but he's shown me some here.
Young Jamie,

3210
02:25:02,761 --> 02:25:04,080
what do we got here?
This is what you do.

3211
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:06,480
Okay,
so the you suck it out of.

3212
02:25:06,481 --> 02:25:11,481
Even though the thighs,
the thighs and the upper middle back 

3213
02:25:11,481 --> 02:25:11,940
area.

3214
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:14,950
They suck it out of there and then 
pumping your ass.

3215
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:16,740
Give me some before.
After Sun.

3216
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:17,640
Look at that.
Hold on.

3217
02:25:17,641 --> 02:25:19,860
Go back to that picture.
Jesus,

3218
02:25:19,890 --> 02:25:22,980
look at that.
I don't like ass and surgery.

3219
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:25,480
I don't like those two words together.
I don't think.

3220
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:28,710
I think as surgery,
if someone says that to you,

3221
02:25:28,730 --> 02:25:29,500
go,
oh dude,

3222
02:25:29,501 --> 02:25:31,040
I'm so sorry.
You've got to get surgery.

3223
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:31,460
No,
no,

3224
02:25:31,470 --> 02:25:33,040
no.
I want to know.

3225
02:25:33,041 --> 02:25:33,680
It's funny,
Bro.

3226
02:25:33,970 --> 02:25:38,590
What you want to get as surgery?
Identify the Gigli fucking pillow out to

3227
02:25:38,750 --> 02:25:40,720
pump her up.
I'm just going to be honest with you and

3228
02:25:40,721 --> 02:25:43,480
you can never get mad at that point.
If someone cat calls you,

3229
02:25:43,481 --> 02:25:47,260
it's like you literally are just 
throwing blood at tigers at that point.

3230
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:49,270
The girl on the right.
Okay.

3231
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:54,660
She didn't get crazy.
She was just a little conservative in 

3232
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:55,570
her approach.
It's like she almost like photoshop,

3233
02:25:55,900 --> 02:26:00,900
like she took a little off the sides and
put it in her butt and kind of see what 

3234
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:04,270
you did there,
but I have to do is crossfit.

3235
02:26:04,390 --> 02:26:05,230
Okay.
Oh,

3236
02:26:05,231 --> 02:26:10,231
but did you see that video of that girl 
doing that clean and she falls and hits 

3237
02:26:10,301 --> 02:26:12,370
her neck and she.
I'll send it to you.

3238
02:26:13,630 --> 02:26:15,580
It's dark dude.
She get hurt.

3239
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:16,450
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3240
02:26:16,451 --> 02:26:17,680
yeah,
yeah.

3241
02:26:17,681 --> 02:26:19,780
She got fucking heart.
She got hurt,

3242
02:26:19,781 --> 02:26:20,770
man.
For sure.

3243
02:26:20,860 --> 02:26:23,400
Guaranteed.
It's not good here.

3244
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:24,950
Let me see where to find it here.
Eddie Bravo.

3245
02:26:24,951 --> 02:26:26,540
Send it to me today.
Uh,

3246
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:28,090
but it's been all over.
Uh,

3247
02:26:28,570 --> 02:26:31,340
it's been all over twitter.
Did it fall on her neck,

3248
02:26:31,341 --> 02:26:31,930
dad?
Dude,

3249
02:26:31,931 --> 02:26:36,250
she cleaned it and it landed like 
literally on her neck.

3250
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:38,470
It was horrific.
Or that's just eddie by himself.

3251
02:26:38,471 --> 02:26:40,590
Hold on a second.
I'm so sorry.

3252
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:44,530
I'm so sorry.
It's rough dude.

3253
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:45,640
Yeah,
that's really rough.

3254
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:46,630
Here it is.
I got it.

3255
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:49,240
Alright,
let me send it to a young Jamie here.

3256
02:26:49,241 --> 02:26:50,210
Hold please.
To,

3257
02:26:50,211 --> 02:26:50,480
to,
to,

3258
02:26:50,490 --> 02:26:53,080
to,
to copy your link.

3259
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:54,370
Oh No,
you can say share.

3260
02:26:54,371 --> 02:26:55,950
Right?
Can you do that?

3261
02:26:56,990 --> 02:26:57,970
That fucked up.
Hold on.

3262
02:26:59,050 --> 02:27:01,060
This is a really awesome part of the 
show.

3263
02:27:01,061 --> 02:27:06,061
This is my favorite part.
It's called Joe is not really talking 

3264
02:27:06,061 --> 02:27:07,800
very well because he's sending Jamie 
assumption that he needs to see.

3265
02:27:08,210 --> 02:27:08,980
All right.
There we go.

3266
02:27:09,310 --> 02:27:10,660
I sent it to you.
I tweeted,

3267
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:13,030
I sent it to your phone.
Was it like having a way out to.

3268
02:27:13,180 --> 02:27:13,730
I should.
Right.

3269
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:17,530
So you have to put it up a yes.
Is that hurt?

3270
02:27:17,531 --> 02:27:18,180
No,
no,

3271
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:23,190
that's not her.
I think more than one chick has done 

3272
02:27:23,190 --> 02:27:25,531
that.
I'm sure he all emailed to you so he 

3273
02:27:25,531 --> 02:27:25,531
could play it on the thing.
It's um,

3274
02:27:25,531 --> 02:27:25,780
uh,
you got it.

3275
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:26,680
Okay.
It's horrible.

3276
02:27:26,681 --> 02:27:28,030
Man.
That sounds wicked horrifying.

3277
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:33,270
Watch she,
she gets it up in the air and then she 

3278
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:34,410
loses control of it and drops it down 
and um,

3279
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:35,350
I don't know if she's doing.

3280
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:36,640
Yeah,
it says crossfit.

3281
02:27:36,910 --> 02:27:38,200
Look at this.
Watch she gets up.

3282
02:27:38,930 --> 02:27:42,320
Oh Man.
Hey.

3283
02:27:42,610 --> 02:27:43,430
Yeah,
not good.

3284
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:45,670
Not Good.
Look at this.

3285
02:27:46,370 --> 02:27:49,150
That girl could have died for sure.
For sure.

3286
02:27:49,151 --> 02:27:50,860
She could have been paralyzed.
She's okay.

3287
02:27:50,861 --> 02:27:55,600
Apparently I'm luckily because the bar 
is larger than her,

3288
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:58,150
you know,
the plates are larger than her body,

3289
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:03,360
so as it falls,
the plates hit the ground and the thing 

3290
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:03,360
probably bounced off the ground,
probably rubber.

3291
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:05,340
So she was all right,
but food,

3292
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:06,530
that's not good.
Yeah.

3293
02:28:06,550 --> 02:28:07,270
And,
and that's,

3294
02:28:07,770 --> 02:28:12,770
that's the issue that a lot of people 
have with know people getting really 

3295
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:14,440
crazy with those kinds of Olympic lifts 
and things along those lines.

3296
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:16,030
You've got to be real careful with that 
shit,

3297
02:28:16,480 --> 02:28:17,170
you know,
it's um,

3298
02:28:18,190 --> 02:28:19,420
it can go wrong,
you know,

3299
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,150
it's one of the things that I really 
love about kettle bells,

3300
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:23,210
like I've never had.

3301
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:25,130
That kind of shit happened to me with 
kettlebells.

3302
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:28,490
Never lost one.
I'd lift pretty heavy with them,

3303
02:28:28,491 --> 02:28:31,490
but I've built up to it over the years 
and I never go to failure.

3304
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:34,760
Like when I'm doing is like it's hard 
and makes you stronger,

3305
02:28:34,761 --> 02:28:39,761
but this like that,
it's not going to make you that kind of 

3306
02:28:39,761 --> 02:28:43,301
strong like that kind of clean press 
squat strong lesson that's a fucking 

3307
02:28:43,301 --> 02:28:47,350
high level strong.
But boy that's so strength Pacific and 

3308
02:28:47,350 --> 02:28:47,550
it's super dangerous.
Yeah.

3309
02:28:47,570 --> 02:28:49,160
Yeah.
And kettle bells more applicable to your

3310
02:28:49,161 --> 02:28:50,060
life.
Like now,

3311
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:55,120
like I literally am swinging my baby,
like it's a Kettlebell and I'm like oh 

3312
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:58,931
wow.
That gym work really made me a better 

3313
02:28:58,931 --> 02:28:58,931
dad.
I do Turkish getups with my kids.

3314
02:28:58,931 --> 02:29:00,980
Which ones at Turkish?
Getups you lied on your back.

3315
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:06,430
I'm going to press them and I sit up 
nice and I'll get up and I hold them up 

3316
02:29:06,430 --> 02:29:06,620
in the air and then slowly let them 
down.

3317
02:29:06,770 --> 02:29:08,780
It was way easier when they're babies,
bro.

3318
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:10,690
It's hard now.
Yeah,

3319
02:29:10,691 --> 02:29:11,470
like that.
It's like,

3320
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:13,430
it's like we're adding weight to the 
baby.

3321
02:29:13,490 --> 02:29:16,130
I carry my kids around all the time too.
That's one thing I do.

3322
02:29:16,131 --> 02:29:18,140
I go hiking and I'll throw my kids and 
my shoulders.

3323
02:29:18,350 --> 02:29:20,660
So it's like my nine year old's like 50 
pounds,

3324
02:29:20,661 --> 02:29:22,430
53 pounds.
So I carry her up hills.

3325
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:23,590
That's legit.
It's good.

3326
02:29:23,591 --> 02:29:28,591
It's a good workout.
Like I kind of have like a little 

3327
02:29:28,591 --> 02:29:28,591
slightly wide hips which kind of like a 
woman,

3328
02:29:28,591 --> 02:29:31,100
so like halfway.
So if you went the other way,

3329
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:32,750
it'd be quick,
quick transition,

3330
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:35,420
but it's still be six slash seven and 
like just not good at basketball.

3331
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:39,320
Big Sexy,
big sexy woman hippie.

3332
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:41,150
But like with the baby though,
I'm like,

3333
02:29:41,151 --> 02:29:46,151
oh I can.
This is why women have these put 'em on 

3334
02:29:46,151 --> 02:29:49,091
the hips.
I think that's why they have them and 

3335
02:29:49,091 --> 02:29:49,091
have them check her out.

3336
02:29:49,091 --> 02:29:49,430
Yeah.
It's not to carry them around.

3337
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:54,780
If they had a pouch,
like a kangaroo or in the hip and he 

3338
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:56,270
grew up right when they got pregnant.
Tucked a little kid right there.

3339
02:29:56,450 --> 02:29:57,430
That'd be amazing.
Yeah.

3340
02:29:57,440 --> 02:30:01,070
They just walk a little sideways limp 
kids sitting right there.

3341
02:30:01,250 --> 02:30:03,050
Yeah.
Because like my wife's like chiseled now

3342
02:30:03,051 --> 02:30:04,430
from just holding the baby.
Oh yeah.

3343
02:30:04,431 --> 02:30:07,250
You get jacked.
Carrying around a weight all day.

3344
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:12,340
It's like you're doing stuff like boxers
use hand weights and they're only like 

3345
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:12,340
two pounds,
you know?

3346
02:30:13,010 --> 02:30:15,110
Remember those ankle ones.
Never use those.

3347
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:15,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

3348
02:30:15,861 --> 02:30:20,861
I used to use those for kicks.
We used to use those and people were 

3349
02:30:20,861 --> 02:30:20,861
like,
Oh,

3350
02:30:20,861 --> 02:30:21,040
you're gonna fuck your knees up.
You know?

3351
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:23,540
Because if you kick hard with ankle 
weights on your fucking knees up,

3352
02:30:24,230 --> 02:30:26,120
so we always have,
but now that I'm older,

3353
02:30:26,121 --> 02:30:26,670
I'm like,
oh no,

3354
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:28,700
no,
you wouldn't just do it right?

3355
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:31,040
Yeah,
it's definitely make you stronger.

3356
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:36,110
Callen one showed me you kicking a bag 
and it was unbelievable to watch.

3357
02:30:36,450 --> 02:30:38,210
We're like onset of Sullivan and son.
He's like,

3358
02:30:38,220 --> 02:30:39,740
Dude,
look at this.

3359
02:30:39,741 --> 02:30:41,390
And he was just wham,
wham.

3360
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:43,940
And I remember just being like,
fuck man,

3361
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:46,610
that's a skill I'll never have that.
I really enjoy watching that.

3362
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:48,770
That's a skill that I don't even believe
I have.

3363
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:51,770
I don't believe it's real.
Like it's crazy.

3364
02:30:51,830 --> 02:30:54,020
It's one of those things where whenever 
I go to workout I'm like,

3365
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:56,990
I really know how to do this.
Like it doesn't seem like I should.

3366
02:30:57,200 --> 02:30:58,990
And it was like a machine gun was just 
Bam,

3367
02:30:59,070 --> 02:30:59,690
Bam,
Bam.

3368
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:01,550
I'm like,
that's a 30 clip right there.

3369
02:31:02,030 --> 02:31:03,470
Well,
I just do it all the time,

3370
02:31:03,471 --> 02:31:05,780
but even even to this day,
like I still.

3371
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:08,640
It's weird because I grew up doing it 
and it's like.

3372
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:12,740
So I kind of barely remember learning it
until we have a piano.

3373
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:14,780
I'm,
I'm playing Bach and I'm like,

3374
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:17,670
so your fingers just find the keys and 
I'm like,

3375
02:31:17,671 --> 02:31:18,290
uh,
I'm just,

3376
02:31:18,350 --> 02:31:19,670
I'm like retarded,
you know,

3377
02:31:19,690 --> 02:31:20,120
and I'm playing

3378
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:25,120
like the craziest songs ever written.
We made this video because Eddie Bravo 

3379
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:29,690
had always seen me do this and he would 
tell people and they would go shut the 

3380
02:31:29,690 --> 02:31:29,690
fuck up,
you know,

3381
02:31:29,690 --> 02:31:31,260
because everybody always thinks that 
everybody's,

3382
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:34,170
everybody's always exaggerating about 
their friend who does something,

3383
02:31:34,171 --> 02:31:35,280
you know,
whatever the fuck it is.

3384
02:31:37,410 --> 02:31:39,600
And so he was always like talking to me 
about,

3385
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,190
about a martial arts kicking.
And I was like,

3386
02:31:44,191 --> 02:31:49,191
well there's a lot of like problems with
some of the ways some people kick and I 

3387
02:31:49,191 --> 02:31:51,030
would explain it to him and then I would
show them on a bag and he'd be like,

3388
02:31:51,031 --> 02:31:56,031
what the fuck?
Like how long have you been able to do 

3389
02:31:56,031 --> 02:31:56,031
this?
I'm like,

3390
02:31:56,031 --> 02:31:56,110
I've been doing this my whole life.
Like how do you know how to like,

3391
02:31:56,130 --> 02:32:01,130
this is crazy.
I can't believe you can do that because 

3392
02:32:01,130 --> 02:32:01,130
muscle memory.

3393
02:32:01,130 --> 02:32:01,130
Well I grew up doing it,
you know,

3394
02:32:01,130 --> 02:32:03,750
it's,
it's just a part of how my body moves.

3395
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:07,260
But because I don't really remember 
learning it,

3396
02:32:07,650 --> 02:32:09,210
it does feel weird.
It feels,

3397
02:32:09,570 --> 02:32:13,080
it feels like I'm not sure I really can 
do it until I do it.

3398
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:14,870
And then every time I do it I go,
oh yeah,

3399
02:32:15,490 --> 02:32:17,550
yeah.
I'm like the shock and awe of a kick.

3400
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:18,450
Oh,
it's horrible.

3401
02:32:18,451 --> 02:32:22,170
Like even if there's someone that is 
more my speed,

3402
02:32:22,530 --> 02:32:24,780
if they just bust out a big kick,
I'm like,

3403
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:26,670
yeah,
it's all right.

3404
02:32:26,730 --> 02:32:27,330
Yeah.
My wife,

3405
02:32:27,790 --> 02:32:30,120
she is a bitch.
Especially leg kicks man,

3406
02:32:30,510 --> 02:32:32,940
if you like see,
like a really good,

3407
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:36,570
like tie fighter and you watch someone 
kicked someone's legs.

3408
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:40,570
It's so horrible.
Like the sound it makes and the power it

3409
02:32:40,571 --> 02:32:42,060
has.
I see that in the UFC all the time.

3410
02:32:42,061 --> 02:32:45,120
It's one of those still to this day,
one of the hardest because I'm like,

3411
02:32:45,170 --> 02:32:45,660
God dammit.

3412
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:48,260
I don't think people are appreciating 
how hard that is.

3413
02:32:48,290 --> 02:32:51,180
Like it's like that other guy's in pain 
right now.

3414
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:56,190
It's just kinda awesome poker face.
Like he just got ate up with that kick 

3415
02:32:56,190 --> 02:32:56,670
and then by the time a guy does start to
show it,

3416
02:32:56,671 --> 02:32:57,150
you're like,
oh no,

3417
02:32:57,151 --> 02:32:59,190
he's done.
His legs are gone.

3418
02:32:59,220 --> 02:33:04,220
I've always wondered that.
Like they just don't show it right 

3419
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:04,220
because that.
Yeah.

3420
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:04,220
Oh for sure.
The toughest man in the world.

3421
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:04,620
If in women,
you know,

3422
02:33:04,621 --> 02:33:09,621
if you,
if somebody who was not trained got 

3423
02:33:09,621 --> 02:33:10,500
kicked like that and like I want to feel
what it feels like in like,

3424
02:33:10,501 --> 02:33:13,560
you let someone like Tyron Woodley or 
something that UFC welterweight champion

3425
02:33:13,561 --> 02:33:16,120
let him lead.
Kick you like,

3426
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:21,260
Oh my God.
But how do you think can be a real lift 

3427
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:21,260
your leg up and you check it.
I'm like,

3428
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:21,870
you would,
um,

3429
02:33:22,110 --> 02:33:23,540
you would try it like they're trying to 
hit them,

3430
02:33:23,541 --> 02:33:24,370
meet their blood.

3431
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:29,370
They could be trying to hit low too.
That's actually a more recently I'm a 

3432
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:34,600
much more used tactic is the low leg 
kick where they're attacking like 

3433
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:34,600
literally,
like right above the ankle.

3434
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:37,110
That's nasty.
And they clip right above the ankle with

3435
02:33:37,111 --> 02:33:39,290
your Shin and it just swells up real bad
on,

3436
02:33:39,310 --> 02:33:40,710
on a lot of guys.
You can't,

3437
02:33:40,711 --> 02:33:43,830
you don't really condition that area 
like over low by the ankle,

3438
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:49,130
but the thigh you can condition,
you can take a few shots and then the 

3439
02:33:49,130 --> 02:33:49,130
other thing you do is as the shots 
coming in,

3440
02:33:49,130 --> 02:33:54,000
you lift your leg up a little bit and 
kind of turn your foot out and so the 

3441
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,021
idea is that your Shin and your thigh 
take the brunt of the hit instead of 

3442
02:33:57,021 --> 02:33:58,920
just the meat of the thigh.
Can you help bone density or is that.

3443
02:33:58,921 --> 02:33:59,170
Yeah.
Yeah,

3444
02:33:59,180 --> 02:34:00,600
it helps bone density.
It actually.

3445
02:34:00,601 --> 02:34:04,800
What it is is as you keep having impacts
over and over again,

3446
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:10,190
a bunch of things happen.
One is there's a bunch of little 

3447
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,190
microfractures that happened,
the heel up and it gets harder.

3448
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:14,690
Also,
there's a calcification that happens 

3449
02:34:14,690 --> 02:34:16,641
because there's a lot of bleeding.
Like a lot of those guys like if you 

3450
02:34:16,641 --> 02:34:16,680
feel their shins,
they're like Jesus Christ,

3451
02:34:16,681 --> 02:34:18,040
like,
like a rock man,

3452
02:34:18,360 --> 02:34:18,900
like,
um,

3453
02:34:18,970 --> 02:34:23,970
is a student pet is a bunch of those 
dudes that are fighting in more time 

3454
02:34:24,371 --> 02:34:29,020
that can kick through baseball bats.
It's super common,

3455
02:34:29,021 --> 02:34:32,800
like all those high level guys can most 
likely kicked through a baseball bat.

3456
02:34:32,801 --> 02:34:34,210
It's hilarious when you watch them do it
too,

3457
02:34:34,211 --> 02:34:39,211
because it looks so terrifying.
That has just kicked critiquing another 

3458
02:34:39,211 --> 02:34:39,290
animal.
Just like that's a dumb.

3459
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:42,010
Yeah.
They've made their shins so fucking hard

3460
02:34:42,011 --> 02:34:47,011
and they kicked so hard.
They can just smash right through 

3461
02:34:47,011 --> 02:34:49,291
things.
Like if a guy like that is kicking your 

3462
02:34:49,291 --> 02:34:49,291
leg,
you're in a nightmare.

3463
02:34:49,291 --> 02:34:49,291
It's,
it's,

3464
02:34:49,291 --> 02:34:51,510
it's a terrible place to be.
Yeah.

3465
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:56,520
I played football.
So like when you talk about brain 

3466
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:56,520
injury,
sometimes I'm like,

3467
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:56,520
man,
am I going to end up crazy?

3468
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:57,370
Because I used to take so many hits to 
the head.

3469
02:34:57,400 --> 02:34:57,880
Yeah.
This,

3470
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:01,270
I forget this gentleman's name,
but why I watched him do this.

3471
02:35:02,690 --> 02:35:04,500
He's warming up right there.
And here it comes.

3472
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:09,880
Dude.
He just snapped that baseball bat path.

3473
02:35:11,210 --> 02:35:14,810
Fuck all that.
I forget that guy's name.

3474
02:35:14,811 --> 02:35:16,190
He's a famous,
uh,

3475
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:18,740
see if he could get his name because 
he's a famous.

3476
02:35:18,741 --> 02:35:19,730
Uh,
yeah.

3477
02:35:19,770 --> 02:35:21,740
Melcher milk.
How do you say his name?

3478
02:35:21,741 --> 02:35:25,340
Melcher men,
nor I hope I'm saying his name right,

3479
02:35:25,341 --> 02:35:30,341
but he's a Moitai coach.
I'm one of the seasons of the ultimate 

3480
02:35:30,341 --> 02:35:30,341
fighter,
the early days,

3481
02:35:30,341 --> 02:35:32,390
but real respected a tie fighter and 
coach.

3482
02:35:32,750 --> 02:35:34,250
There's a bunch of guys who could do 
that.

3483
02:35:34,460 --> 02:35:37,010
It's a real common move actually with 
more tie fighters.

3484
02:35:37,011 --> 02:35:38,990
They kicked through baseball bats.
Here's another one.

3485
02:35:38,991 --> 02:35:42,170
So that's,
that's a broken shinbone not for him,

3486
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:43,190
for you and me.
Yeah.

3487
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:49,780
This guy's going to kick through it 
while he's got like a cord attached to 

3488
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:49,780
his leg.
Did a sports science.

3489
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:50,610
Oh,
so I got like,

3490
02:35:50,690 --> 02:35:55,690
look at this dude.
Why in the fuck dude?

3491
02:35:56,490 --> 02:35:59,020
Who was that same guy?
Yeah,

3492
02:35:59,240 --> 02:36:02,510
so he doesn't all the time.
That guy's probably busted 100 bats.

3493
02:36:03,170 --> 02:36:05,870
If that guy kicks you,
it would hurt so bad.

3494
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:07,310
Oh my God.
Dude.

3495
02:36:07,450 --> 02:36:12,450
It would have been one of the worst 
things that's ever happened to you and 

3496
02:36:13,101 --> 02:36:15,530
then everything else,
it's like your basement flooding.

3497
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:20,560
It's like,
what can you do when you don't have a 

3498
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:20,560
foot to stand?
Well,

3499
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:23,530
you can't punch either you like your 
punches or they become like these 

3500
02:36:23,530 --> 02:36:25,040
windmill punches.
You can't pivot off your foot.

3501
02:36:25,100 --> 02:36:27,350
You know you can't place weight on it.
You're in agony.

3502
02:36:27,380 --> 02:36:29,360
It's like ready to give out and they 
don't show it.

3503
02:36:30,310 --> 02:36:31,340
Yeah,
well a lot of them don't.

3504
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:36,340
Yeah.
A lot of them have an awesome poker 

3505
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:36,340
face.
Like it takes a while.

3506
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:36,650
Cool.
It's the hardest.

3507
02:36:36,890 --> 02:36:38,840
Probably the hardest sport to ever 
compete in.

3508
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:40,340
I'd be like,
fuck,

3509
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:41,800
if it's not the hardest sport to compete
in,

3510
02:36:41,870 --> 02:36:46,870
I'd like to know what is it's got to be.
It's one of them because strengthened 

3511
02:36:46,870 --> 02:36:48,290
durrance mental ability.
You know,

3512
02:36:48,291 --> 02:36:53,291
you're basically a quarterback and a 
running back and linebacker at the same 

3513
02:36:53,291 --> 02:36:57,011
time.
The only thing that I would think might 

3514
02:36:57,011 --> 02:36:59,090
be harder to do is those ultra marathons
when those dudes are running,

3515
02:36:59,091 --> 02:37:01,310
like they were talking about the big 
foot 200.

3516
02:37:01,570 --> 02:37:04,250
When those dudes are running 200 miles 
over mountains,

3517
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:07,250
that might be harder to do than an mma 
fight.

3518
02:37:07,670 --> 02:37:12,670
Like if you thought of the amount of 
people that could fight an MMA fight 

3519
02:37:12,670 --> 02:37:16,720
versus the amount of people that could 
run for eight hours in a row run 200,

3520
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:17,990
five miles.

3521
02:37:17,990 --> 02:37:18,830
How many.
Hm.

3522
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:21,320
I think it's.
It's close.

3523
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:26,470
Real close.
There are different things obviously 

3524
02:37:26,470 --> 02:37:26,470
because one of them is dealing with 
getting your ass kicked,

3525
02:37:26,470 --> 02:37:29,120
but the other one is dealing with your 
own demons,

3526
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:33,420
like your demons that wanting to quit 
demon and the the.

3527
02:37:33,710 --> 02:37:36,050
How much did you prepare?
Did you prepare properly?

3528
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:38,030
What about the discipline demon?
You know,

3529
02:37:38,450 --> 02:37:43,450
fuck off demon that tripped up the 
discipline demon and you didn't get in 

3530
02:37:43,450 --> 02:37:46,490
good enough shape to really run 205 
miles and 78 hours,

3531
02:37:46,610 --> 02:37:49,730
which is just insane man.
Versus self versus man versus man.

3532
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:50,780
Yeah.
That's interesting.

3533
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:53,060
The white whale versus a war movie,
you know,

3534
02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:55,370
it's like your golf.
They always say he played.

3535
02:37:55,730 --> 02:37:57,260
I've never played golf,
but like they say,

3536
02:37:57,261 --> 02:37:59,480
you play yourself.
It's about.

3537
02:37:59,530 --> 02:38:00,230
Yeah,
that makes sense.

3538
02:38:00,231 --> 02:38:00,890
Yeah.
Yeah,

3539
02:38:00,891 --> 02:38:01,760
that makes sense.
I mean,

3540
02:38:01,761 --> 02:38:02,800
you always get the shot,
right?

3541
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:04,920
You get your own shot,
you set it up on the tee,

3542
02:38:04,921 --> 02:38:06,320
you get to whack it,
you move it around.

3543
02:38:06,321 --> 02:38:07,970
No one's knocking it out of the way for 
you.

3544
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:10,670
It's not like pool.
Not like hiding the ball on you.

3545
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:14,240
Right?
Just uverse self 78 hours.

3546
02:38:14,241 --> 02:38:16,820
I can't fucking crazy.
That might be harder.

3547
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:19,600
It might be harder than an MMA fight 
because.

3548
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:20,600
Yeah,
because they're resilient.

3549
02:38:20,601 --> 02:38:22,430
I just can't even picture being awake 
that long.

3550
02:38:22,460 --> 02:38:27,460
Like I've been up for 40 hours and like 
I'm listening to you definitely 

3551
02:38:27,460 --> 02:38:27,460
hallucinating.
People hallucinate when they run,

3552
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:29,360
when they run those races.
Yeah.

3553
02:38:29,361 --> 02:38:34,361
I was hearing that guy on your shelf.
I know the one about the baby and 

3554
02:38:34,361 --> 02:38:34,370
Everest.
Oh yeah.

3555
02:38:34,371 --> 02:38:35,910
That was my friend Ben O'brian.
Yeah.

3556
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:40,040
That was altitude sickness and a 
altitude sickness and some sort of a,

3557
02:38:40,041 --> 02:38:45,041
a probably a stomach bug and the two of 
them together and he was just tripping 

3558
02:38:45,591 --> 02:38:46,130
balls.

3559
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:49,940
He saw baby saw wolf that didn't really 
exist like he was out of it.

3560
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:54,050
I feel like like if people aren't 
reacting to a giant baby that you see,

3561
02:38:54,740 --> 02:38:59,740
that would be the like,
it's like you guys don't see this giant 

3562
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:00,200
baby who'd feel like such a fucking 
idiot.

3563
02:39:00,230 --> 02:39:01,330
He'd be like,
oh no,

3564
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:08,260
what do I do now?
Like that hits so many levels of primal 

3565
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:08,260
shit,
like take care of the baby,

3566
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:13,540
but also like,
what the fuck is going on with this 

3567
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:14,840
baby?
Oh fuck a baby just in the woods.

3568
02:39:14,841 --> 02:39:16,280
I imagine if you're just walking through
the woods,

3569
02:39:16,281 --> 02:39:18,740
you find a baby.
What do you do?

3570
02:39:18,741 --> 02:39:20,960
Like you're deep in the woods.
Did take the baby.

3571
02:39:21,440 --> 02:39:23,120
I feel like you got it right.
If you take.

3572
02:39:23,150 --> 02:39:25,430
Do you have to sit with the baby and go,
hello?

3573
02:39:27,070 --> 02:39:31,130
Anybody messing the baby's right here,
but whoever,

3574
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:33,560
but if you steal the baby it's like you 
piece of shit.

3575
02:39:33,561 --> 02:39:36,170
I was just going to the bathroom.
Took my fucking kid.

3576
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:41,520
I called.
I called out where I was pants down some

3577
02:39:41,900 --> 02:39:46,310
crazy hood rat having a baby in the.
Taking a shit in the woods.

3578
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:47,280
Baby.

3579
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:51,920
Baby and wilderness.
You should take the baby,

3580
02:39:51,921 --> 02:39:52,430
right?
Yeah.

3581
02:39:52,431 --> 02:39:57,431
You should just plop you know the baby 
down on the ground right next to where 

3582
02:39:57,431 --> 02:40:00,431
he shit.
Keep an eye on them and don't shit on 

3583
02:40:00,431 --> 02:40:00,431
him.
Yeah,

3584
02:40:00,431 --> 02:40:00,800
I mean there's holes and raccoons and 
all the things we've been discussing,

3585
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:04,250
but you're talking about shame of shit 
next to a baby with no memory.

3586
02:40:04,290 --> 02:40:05,570
Yeah.
I'm just not a good argument.

3587
02:40:05,571 --> 02:40:06,680
That's for sure.
Terrible run.

3588
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:11,870
Yeah.
You gotta watch those babies.

3589
02:40:11,871 --> 02:40:12,700
Man.
I like what you were saying,

3590
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:14,180
how your wife started to get like

3591
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:17,220
really like concerned about things when 
she had a kid.

3592
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:18,180
Yeah,
that's what,

3593
02:40:18,181 --> 02:40:23,181
that's normal natural thing.
That's why we get so freaked out when 

3594
02:40:23,181 --> 02:40:23,181
someone leaves their kid in the car.
Like what?

3595
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:26,160
You left a baby in the car by itself.
Oh,

3596
02:40:26,161 --> 02:40:27,750
you're,
you're not doing this right?

3597
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:29,580
Yeah.
That's when I really get triggered.

3598
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:33,180
Like if I do like child abuse stuff,
that's what I'm like.

3599
02:40:33,510 --> 02:40:38,510
I,
that's what I think people are 

3600
02:40:38,510 --> 02:40:38,510
describing.
What triggered?

3601
02:40:38,510 --> 02:40:38,510
I literally get angry.
Oh yeah,

3602
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:40,530
sure.
Child abuse stuff for sure.

3603
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:42,300
Yeah.
You see somebody yanked their kid.

3604
02:40:42,301 --> 02:40:44,910
I saw some lady kicker kid in a video 
online.

3605
02:40:45,250 --> 02:40:50,250
She was a baby,
like a two year old last kicked it like 

3606
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:51,960
hard and the kids stiffened up,
like probably got code.

3607
02:40:52,470 --> 02:40:57,470
It was horrible,
horrible to see campus crawling around 

3608
02:40:57,470 --> 02:40:58,260
on the ground and she just kicked it.
Don't pull it up please.

3609
02:40:58,770 --> 02:41:02,010
Okay.
So you type it in like you saw use.

3610
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:05,760
Um,
it's just that stuff is triggering.

3611
02:41:05,761 --> 02:41:06,930
Right?
Same with dogs.

3612
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,570
Like there was this video or some 
chicken,

3613
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:10,290
a subway just hitting a dog and I'm 
like,

3614
02:41:11,320 --> 02:41:12,860
you know,
Ooh,

3615
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:17,960
that's just makes it like,
it triggers everything in me that 

3616
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:20,700
protects weakness where I'm like,
they can't protect themselves.

3617
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:23,120
What about ostrich?
A punch the shit out of an Australia.

3618
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:24,750
Yeah.
It's all about hockey.

3619
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:27,510
They get cocky on you.
They'll start pecking.

3620
02:41:27,511 --> 02:41:30,570
You did he met?
Chickens will come at me,

3621
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:33,060
there'll be like super scared and then 
they'll start being a dick.

3622
02:41:33,270 --> 02:41:35,400
If you have bare feet,
they'll go for your toes.

3623
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:37,030
Yeah,
I think it might be able to eat a tow.

3624
02:41:37,330 --> 02:41:39,920
My brother Fed it chicken,
which is a fucked up.

3625
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:43,860
Do that.
That's how you get mad chickens too.

3626
02:41:43,861 --> 02:41:47,300
They have mad chicken disease for up 
like that.

3627
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:52,340
It's like upset chicken.
It's like not quite as bad and we're on 

3628
02:41:52,340 --> 02:41:52,340
fear factor.
I got attacked by an ostrich.

3629
02:41:52,340 --> 02:41:54,300
Not really.
If I was like an exaggerator I would say

3630
02:41:54,301 --> 02:41:56,460
to attack me,
but definitely took a swing at me.

3631
02:41:56,490 --> 02:41:57,990
If you were a buzzfeed,
you were attacked by.

3632
02:41:57,991 --> 02:41:59,580
Grabbed his neck.
I was like,

3633
02:41:59,581 --> 02:42:00,900
bitch,
get the fuck out of here.

3634
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:06,100
Like it,
it came close enough where I had to do 

3635
02:42:06,100 --> 02:42:07,911
listen and then push it away from me,
get away from the fence and they try to 

3636
02:42:07,911 --> 02:42:07,911
fuck you,
fuck you up.

3637
02:42:07,911 --> 02:42:12,891
Rather they try to get some fucking,
they don't want you there and you're 

3638
02:42:12,891 --> 02:42:16,040
like bitch,
get the fuck out because they can like 

3639
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:16,650
take a person kinda right.
They're not a small animal.

3640
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:19,020
And what's interesting is they have red 
meat,

3641
02:42:19,530 --> 02:42:24,530
um,
they have ostrich burgers that you get 

3642
02:42:24,530 --> 02:42:25,590
at fuddruckers and they're quite 
delicious and they're actually very high

3643
02:42:25,591 --> 02:42:27,900
in protein,
like much higher in protein I think than

3644
02:42:27,901 --> 02:42:32,901
beef.
I think they're up there with like wild 

3645
02:42:32,901 --> 02:42:32,901
game,
like in the neighborhood,

3646
02:42:32,901 --> 02:42:32,901
like maybe not.
Why not?

3647
02:42:32,901 --> 02:42:35,850
Maybe not like,
like wild Mousse or something like that.

3648
02:42:35,851 --> 02:42:40,851
But in the neighborhood,
like getting closer to that than it is 

3649
02:42:40,851 --> 02:42:43,191
to like beef and it's a real lean but 
it's weird because it's like 

3650
02:42:43,191 --> 02:42:43,530
essentially,
again,

3651
02:42:43,531 --> 02:42:46,350
it's a fucking dinosaur looking at a 
diet and you think like,

3652
02:42:46,351 --> 02:42:47,970
this is gonna be like chicken.
No,

3653
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:50,700
it's not only chicken dogs red to red 
meat.

3654
02:42:51,430 --> 02:42:53,610
It's fucking crazy old raptor.

3655
02:42:56,360 --> 02:42:59,010
Who Do you think real ostrich Kent.
A kangaroo.

3656
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:00,840
Who Do you got money on?
Dude?

3657
02:43:00,841 --> 02:43:02,820
That's a good question.
The kangaroo.

3658
02:43:02,821 --> 02:43:04,290
Clearly,
because they'll choke you.

3659
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:10,160
Kangaroos will choke you.
Plus they sit back on their tail and 

3660
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:10,160
they fucking punt you.
Right?

3661
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:12,190
You know,
I don't think an ostrich can fuck

3662
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:17,190
with that.
Ostrich is going to try to kick the 

3663
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:17,190
kangaroo.
The kangaroo recently pitch.

3664
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:18,550
You simply can't sit back on your tail,
Bro.

3665
02:43:18,610 --> 02:43:21,340
It's like a guy who took like,
Ooh,

3666
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:23,590
look at this.
Is there a kangaroo versus an ostrich?

3667
02:43:23,591 --> 02:43:26,670
This natural fight.
Is it really an EMU?

3668
02:43:26,790 --> 02:43:27,340
But.
Oh,

3669
02:43:27,341 --> 02:43:28,990
it's an email.
It's close enough to.

3670
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:30,310
It is like a kangaroo.
Right?

3671
02:43:31,720 --> 02:43:35,890
So it's a kangaroo in an email.
I thought an email is like a peacock.

3672
02:43:36,540 --> 02:43:38,160
Oh Shit.
Oh Guy.

3673
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:39,790
Oh,
that thing looks scary.

3674
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:41,680
See,
I would have my money.

3675
02:43:41,710 --> 02:43:45,490
I don't know if it was bigger for sure.
Email.

3676
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:47,020
Huh?
There's two of them.

3677
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:49,120
Yeah,
but that's a little ass kangaroo.

3678
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:52,570
It's true.
That kangaroos small.

3679
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:54,550
They have big giant Kangaroos,
man.

3680
02:43:55,170 --> 02:43:58,000
Some dude got fucked up by a kangaroo 
recently.

3681
02:43:58,890 --> 02:44:00,640
Well,
this is a crazy little fight here.

3682
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:02,800
The email was all goofy.

3683
02:44:02,860 --> 02:44:05,770
He's like shucking and Jiving,
well fake moves,

3684
02:44:06,570 --> 02:44:07,930
trying to fake them out.
He's like,

3685
02:44:07,950 --> 02:44:08,820
no,
the Kangaroos,

3686
02:44:08,821 --> 02:44:11,260
like I'm taking this food bitch,
this is my food.

3687
02:44:11,860 --> 02:44:13,430
And the email was like,
oh motherfucker,

3688
02:44:13,660 --> 02:44:18,660
I'm taking that food.
They'll get the email is like literally 

3689
02:44:18,660 --> 02:44:21,320
like a star wars bird doesn't even look 
real like the shadiness and that they're

3690
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:26,510
ready to go at it.
It looks like it would fight like 

3691
02:44:26,510 --> 02:44:26,510
drafting like this with its neck just 
like it.

3692
02:44:26,510 --> 02:44:27,880
Well you might be right.
It's like,

3693
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:31,060
it's like scary and like precious at the
same time.

3694
02:44:31,061 --> 02:44:33,730
It's like hello.
It's the same posturing.

3695
02:44:34,720 --> 02:44:36,010
Yeah.
Not Making a move.

3696
02:44:36,070 --> 02:44:41,070
Come on bitch.
It's like a fancy trying to stomp their 

3697
02:44:41,070 --> 02:44:43,660
shit technique.
The kangaroo.

3698
02:44:43,661 --> 02:44:48,661
I just charged this bitch.
I with this guy doesn't know what the 

3699
02:44:48,661 --> 02:44:49,330
fuck he's doing.
I just get to move in on this.

3700
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:50,890
There's three of them.
Yeah.

3701
02:44:50,891 --> 02:44:52,720
But if you.
I bet if you smack one of them.

3702
02:44:52,721 --> 02:44:57,721
The other two,
it just got a stupid thing to think of.

3703
02:45:03,250 --> 02:45:04,750
Is there ever.
Is there a contact?

3704
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:06,240
I Dunno.
I don't think so.

3705
02:45:06,250 --> 02:45:11,250
Things his bitch ass fight.
Didn't they get one of those big angry 

3706
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:12,130
Kangaroos?
That's a little tiny baby.

3707
02:45:12,131 --> 02:45:14,800
Kangaroo form.
Yeah.

3708
02:45:15,170 --> 02:45:18,370
The end of the day.
That kangaroo got all the fucking leaves

3709
02:45:18,530 --> 02:45:23,530
was stupid.
Birds need to step the fuck back and 

3710
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:24,850
respect the superiority of the mammal.
I'm on team Malmo.

3711
02:45:24,851 --> 02:45:29,851
I don't give a fuck.
I think people should all be lumped in 

3712
02:45:29,851 --> 02:45:30,370
together as one unit,
but it's US versus them.

3713
02:45:30,371 --> 02:45:32,690
When it comes to mammals have 
breastfeeding big.

3714
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:35,900
The mammary gland.
Yeah.

3715
02:45:35,950 --> 02:45:40,950
If you have an egg,
your kid comes out of an egg the fuck 

3716
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:40,950
out.
Get out of here.

3717
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:40,950
You're not part of the conversation.

3718
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:44,140
That's so old.
That's like driving around and some sort

3719
02:45:44,141 --> 02:45:49,141
of a horse buggy.
So literally they're hipsters.

3720
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:53,350
Imagine if a woman,
your wife gave birth to an egg.

3721
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:55,120
I sit on it.
Wait,

3722
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:58,510
just sit there.
Keep that egg warm.

3723
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:00,580
Yeah.
Ridiculous.

3724
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:07,020
But if it was like the Pangolin yeah.
Penguins are like almost like throwing 

3725
02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:07,770
the frog.
Like the Inbetween Bucher.

3726
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:12,800
They fly.
They have to keep the baby on their 

3727
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:12,800
feet.
Remember that they.

3728
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:14,370
They put the baby up high on there.
Otherwise,

3729
02:46:14,390 --> 02:46:16,600
it'll freeze if it touches the ground,
the,

3730
02:46:16,810 --> 02:46:19,280
the environments that they're like smart
social,

3731
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:20,870
that's like nature.
Just telling you,

3732
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:25,900
look dude,
your contributions are really non 

3733
02:46:25,900 --> 02:46:25,900
valuable.
Okay.

3734
02:46:25,900 --> 02:46:29,120
We're barely accepting this model still 
right now.

3735
02:46:29,150 --> 02:46:34,150
If it wasn't for the Tuxedo,
you guys are out there essentially 

3736
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:36,140
population control for local fish and 
their food for leopard seals.

3737
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:38,570
That's their position.
Just keep.

3738
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:41,660
Keep making those babies and keep 
holding onto those eggs.

3739
02:46:41,661 --> 02:46:42,980
It's a niche.
No,

3740
02:46:43,220 --> 02:46:48,220
and the dude that's a.
it's a weird society because the dude 

3741
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:48,220
has take care of the egg.
Interesting.

3742
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:48,770
Yeah.
Like chick takes off,

3743
02:46:48,771 --> 02:46:51,920
gets a bunch of fish,
stuffs in her fat face comes back,

3744
02:46:51,921 --> 02:46:54,220
but it's a long ass hall and during this
long ass hauled,

3745
02:46:54,221 --> 02:46:56,270
the dude has to take the egg and sit in 
on his feet.

3746
02:46:56,570 --> 02:46:58,370
Nice.
And he's got to protect it from the snow

3747
02:46:58,371 --> 02:47:00,500
on the ground.
The blizzard conditions.

3748
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:02,480
And those are gender roles and gender.
Yeah.

3749
02:47:02,481 --> 02:47:07,481
Look at that man.
See that's a male holding on to the egg 

3750
02:47:07,481 --> 02:47:08,360
and then the babies are about to be born
baby.

3751
02:47:08,361 --> 02:47:09,300
Like I'm out of here,
bitch.

3752
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:12,160
Yeah.
Actually what that is,

3753
02:47:12,161 --> 02:47:13,940
or modern,
they're very modern birds.

3754
02:47:14,030 --> 02:47:19,030
Cute little fuckers too.
Just because I'm a man doesn't mean I 

3755
02:47:19,030 --> 02:47:19,030
can't sit on my fucking leg.

3756
02:47:19,030 --> 02:47:22,980
It's just weird because they're almost 
defenseless is like nature saying no,

3757
02:47:23,060 --> 02:47:24,410
you can't even fly,
dude.

3758
02:47:24,470 --> 02:47:25,940
No,
we're not going to let you can.

3759
02:47:25,960 --> 02:47:26,270
Well,
yeah,

3760
02:47:26,271 --> 02:47:28,010
when you're on the ground,
you can't move fast.

3761
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:30,470
We want you like lumbering.
Barely.

3762
02:47:30,650 --> 02:47:35,650
You have to give birth on the ground.
The only time you can get away from 

3763
02:47:35,650 --> 02:47:36,530
anything is when you're in the water,
but you're rarely in the water,

3764
02:47:36,531 --> 02:47:40,010
so stay on the ground and be vulnerable 
with a walk.

3765
02:47:40,011 --> 02:47:41,790
It's so absurd.
If you played like a Tuba,

3766
02:47:41,820 --> 02:47:43,060
it's like a comedy.
Yeah.

3767
02:47:43,070 --> 02:47:45,210
This is not a penguin alive that I 
couldn't beat in a race.

3768
02:47:45,530 --> 02:47:47,840
I can be drunk and I'll beat them.
I'm like,

3769
02:47:47,841 --> 02:47:49,430
C'mon Pussy.
Ready?

3770
02:47:49,460 --> 02:47:50,240
Set.
Go.

3771
02:47:50,241 --> 02:47:53,660
Fuck you.
They're absurd animals because they have

3772
02:47:53,661 --> 02:47:55,250
no,
but they do have predators though.

3773
02:47:55,280 --> 02:47:57,500
How come it's not just like they're not 
wiped out.

3774
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:59,540
Leopard seals are.

3775
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:01,880
They Jack them,
but they can only eat so many.

3776
02:48:02,270 --> 02:48:04,370
Leopard seals are fucking huge,
man.

3777
02:48:04,470 --> 02:48:07,310
There's a leopard seal,
killed a photographer a few years back.

3778
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:13,120
It was the first time ever is there,
which is weird because they're 

3779
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:14,900
apparently,
they're very intelligent too,

3780
02:48:14,901 --> 02:48:19,901
and they've,
they've actually brought photographers 

3781
02:48:19,901 --> 02:48:19,901
and divers.
They brought them up,

3782
02:48:19,901 --> 02:48:21,260
seals till a sealer,
a penguin,

3783
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:22,910
not a seal,
a penguin.

3784
02:48:22,911 --> 02:48:27,911
They'll kill a penguin and bring it over
to a photographer and try to like the 

3785
02:48:27,911 --> 02:48:27,911
photographer,
like eat,

3786
02:48:27,911 --> 02:48:27,911
come on man,
eat.

3787
02:48:27,911 --> 02:48:32,760
He was hungry and if like tried to help 
them and they've hung out with them for 

3788
02:48:32,760 --> 02:48:34,340
days on end.
It's really something amazing footage of

3789
02:48:34,341 --> 02:48:36,000
those things.
But um,

3790
02:48:36,380 --> 02:48:38,840
as far as I know,
they very,

3791
02:48:38,841 --> 02:48:43,841
very rarely attack people and that was 
the only incident that I had ever heard 

3792
02:48:43,841 --> 02:48:45,140
of where they had killed somebody.
But it was pretty recent,

3793
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:47,860
like within the last 10 years I think.
Wow.

3794
02:48:48,350 --> 02:48:50,360
They don't look real men.
Leopard seals.

3795
02:48:50,420 --> 02:48:51,140
Yeah.
Have you ever seen him?

3796
02:48:51,230 --> 02:48:55,530
That's one right there.
Please look at the teeth on that thing.

3797
02:48:58,420 --> 02:49:03,420
Look in the fucking teeth in that thing.
At that time she opened her mouth and 

3798
02:49:03,420 --> 02:49:05,440
her head was twice as large as a grizzly
bears head.

3799
02:49:05,770 --> 02:49:09,900
What in the fuck,
like how come when we were kids,

3800
02:49:09,901 --> 02:49:13,140
we never heard about this.
Look at the size of that fucking thing.

3801
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:16,860
So this is the.
This is the leopard seal that was trying

3802
02:49:16,861 --> 02:49:18,960
to feed the photographer,
the photographer.

3803
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:20,190
What does the site,
Jamie,

3804
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:25,220
I just a son imager.
It's just a series of pictures or you 

3805
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:25,220
can find it.
Folks.

3806
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:27,270
I have faith in you,
but they're worth looking at.

3807
02:49:27,271 --> 02:49:31,410
These photos are amazing.
This creature doesn't look real.

3808
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:33,960
Like look at the face on that thing with
the teeth.

3809
02:49:33,990 --> 02:49:36,450
It looks like the thing from neverending
story,

3810
02:49:36,451 --> 02:49:38,820
like the smiling where it's like,
hey man,

3811
02:49:38,821 --> 02:49:41,380
you want some fish?
And just think about the massive.

3812
02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:47,150
Yeah,
with a face that's twice as large as a 

3813
02:49:47,150 --> 02:49:47,150
grizzly bears head.

3814
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:48,930
What?
What?

3815
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:52,260
Just think about how fucking big grizzly
bear is,

3816
02:49:52,261 --> 02:49:54,300
dude.
That's twice as big.

3817
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:59,960
It's like this enormous avatar demon 
that lives in the water and eats 

3818
02:50:00,841 --> 02:50:03,840
penguins.
They're amazing.

3819
02:50:04,230 --> 02:50:05,730
They're amazing.
I mean,

3820
02:50:05,731 --> 02:50:10,731
it's just one of the most astounding and
an overlooked,

3821
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:14,820
underappreciated animals in the ocean.
Yeah.

3822
02:50:14,821 --> 02:50:16,920
I never knew any of this until right 
now.

3823
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:18,240
This is a fucking mammal.
You know what I mean?

3824
02:50:18,241 --> 02:50:19,940
Look at that thing.
Just chill in there.

3825
02:50:20,740 --> 02:50:21,990
It's like smiling.
It's like,

3826
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:25,380
man,
it's fucking a huge killing machine,

3827
02:50:25,381 --> 02:50:26,610
man.
Probably need a penguin.

3828
02:50:26,611 --> 02:50:27,540
I got a guy.
I mean,

3829
02:50:27,541 --> 02:50:29,370
when you think about seals,
what do you think of?

3830
02:50:29,371 --> 02:50:29,850
You Think,
oh,

3831
02:50:29,851 --> 02:50:32,040
have cute little fellows.
The hang out and eat some fish.

3832
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:36,510
Not this motherfucker.
This is a murdering machine and it's the

3833
02:50:36,511 --> 02:50:37,530
biggest one,
right?

3834
02:50:37,531 --> 02:50:41,190
So this is a big ass giant seal that 
just killed shit.

3835
02:50:42,490 --> 02:50:45,270
Why did they hang with the other types 
of seals?

3836
02:50:45,271 --> 02:50:49,590
Or is there a wonder if the other seals 
have like websites dedicated to shitting

3837
02:50:49,591 --> 02:50:52,390
on the leopard seals are slippery 
privilege.

3838
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:55,080
Yeah.
Privilege and prejudice.

3839
02:50:55,081 --> 02:50:57,960
All of it.
Leopard seal privilege is real,

3840
02:50:57,961 --> 02:50:59,100
Bro.
It's so real.

3841
02:50:59,670 --> 02:51:04,670
It's the most real thing in the world.
You know what's fucked up is like sexism

3842
02:51:05,011 --> 02:51:06,840
does exist.
You know,

3843
02:51:06,841 --> 02:51:11,490
a shit thinking does exist.
Like real hard line,

3844
02:51:11,550 --> 02:51:14,430
dopey,
right wing ideology does exist,

3845
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:19,880
but when you pretend that ideas that 
oppose you are those things that are all

3846
02:51:20,131 --> 02:51:22,200
the ideas that oppose your super or 
outright,

3847
02:51:22,201 --> 02:51:27,201
and that's one of the things they've 
been doing with Jordan Peterson and 

3848
02:51:27,201 --> 02:51:27,201
recently it's crazy.
These,

3849
02:51:27,201 --> 02:51:31,550
um,
these are the authors of these articles 

3850
02:51:31,550 --> 02:51:34,281
about him and the,
of Charlottesville and all these 

3851
02:51:34,281 --> 02:51:36,801
different things.
They'd have him lump Jordan Peterson 

3852
02:51:36,801 --> 02:51:38,930
have him lumped in,
but we're actually not charlottesville 

3853
02:51:38,930 --> 02:51:38,930
because of the Google memo.
Um,

3854
02:51:38,930 --> 02:51:41,850
have him lumped in with far right.
They called them a far right.

3855
02:51:41,851 --> 02:51:43,110
Conservative.
It's just not true.

3856
02:51:43,250 --> 02:51:45,060
It's not true when it also muddies the 
water.

3857
02:51:45,061 --> 02:51:48,630
So there's no meaning and they call them
outright like he's not all right.

3858
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:49,920
He's got,
damn.

3859
02:51:50,320 --> 02:51:55,320
He's a professional intellectual genius.
He's absolutely a genius and a kind 

3860
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:57,240
person from what I've heard about.
Very kind,

3861
02:51:57,241 --> 02:51:58,400
very sweet guy.
I really,

3862
02:51:58,470 --> 02:51:59,940
I really enjoyed talking to him.
He's,

3863
02:51:59,970 --> 02:52:04,770
he's genuine and he has real concerns 
about all these things.

3864
02:52:04,771 --> 02:52:05,860
And I think

3865
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:11,130
very valid concerns in particular about 
people wanting to enforce their ideas on

3866
02:52:12,401 --> 02:52:17,401
other people and make people behave a 
certain way and there's a real 

3867
02:52:17,401 --> 02:52:18,100
inclination that people have for that 
they really do.

3868
02:52:18,460 --> 02:52:23,460
And you're seeing that with 
Charlottesville mean part of the 

3869
02:52:23,460 --> 02:52:27,061
reaction to all this stuff.
Part of the reaction to all this stuff 

3870
02:52:27,061 --> 02:52:27,930
is realizing that this,
these,

3871
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:30,010
this kind of thinking can exist,
right?

3872
02:52:30,060 --> 02:52:35,060
That this,
this shit that you didn't expect to see 

3873
02:52:35,060 --> 02:52:38,430
can just pop up like that.
Like I'm almost thinking we have to see 

3874
02:52:38,430 --> 02:52:39,570
it to know it's real.
Yeah.

3875
02:52:39,580 --> 02:52:41,110
Because I thought a lot of this was 
gone.

3876
02:52:41,170 --> 02:52:43,000
Like I was fairly naive about it because
I,

3877
02:52:43,001 --> 02:52:43,740
I,
you know,

3878
02:52:43,750 --> 02:52:46,390
I hear people overuse these words all 
the time and I'm like,

3879
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:47,770
no,
these people are gone.

3880
02:52:47,771 --> 02:52:50,140
We beat these people.
We don't even let them adopt highways,

3881
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:50,950
you know?

3882
02:52:50,950 --> 02:52:52,870
And then you call other people Nazis 
that aren't,

3883
02:52:52,871 --> 02:52:55,870
that if fucks the whole thing up.
That's not a Nazi,

3884
02:52:55,990 --> 02:52:58,260
that's a Nazi right there.
They are.

3885
02:52:58,270 --> 02:53:01,180
And you have to be able to identify it.
It's also extremely,

3886
02:53:01,260 --> 02:53:03,490
uh,
a shitty to,

3887
02:53:03,580 --> 02:53:06,430
to people that have been victims of 
actual Nazis.

3888
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:07,270
Yeah.
Where you're like,

3889
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:12,300
oh,
a microbes like a microaggression at 

3890
02:53:12,300 --> 02:53:12,730
Brown isn't my fucking grandmother and 
an oven.

3891
02:53:13,150 --> 02:53:15,040
That's not the same thing.
In other words,

3892
02:53:15,041 --> 02:53:16,080
too many don't.
I mean,

3893
02:53:16,190 --> 02:53:18,250
the problem is that it's an indefensible
word.

3894
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:20,290
You call someone a Nazi and it's 
indefensible.

3895
02:53:20,291 --> 02:53:22,510
You put them on their back heels and 
then they have to deal with that.

3896
02:53:22,570 --> 02:53:27,570
Well,
that's what annoyed me about the right 

3897
02:53:27,570 --> 02:53:28,900
when I was a kid was a sinner or like 
Jesus because Jesus where it's like it's

3898
02:53:28,901 --> 02:53:33,490
a conversation ender and that's why I 
saw almost that flip where now I see the

3899
02:53:33,491 --> 02:53:35,770
left doing it where it's like racist.

3900
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:36,460
It's like,
dude,

3901
02:53:36,461 --> 02:53:39,100
we're arguing about like a proton,
like what does this even mean?

3902
02:53:39,101 --> 02:53:40,870
It's just like a way to end a 
conversation.

3903
02:53:40,871 --> 02:53:42,250
And I'm like,
it's starting to.

3904
02:53:42,910 --> 02:53:47,910
Yeah.
Starting to act like a religion where 

3905
02:53:47,910 --> 02:53:49,791
it's,
where it's like white guilt is original 

3906
02:53:49,791 --> 02:53:52,201
sin and then being woke is baptism and 
veganism is kosher and it starting to 

3907
02:53:52,201 --> 02:53:54,340
align up Kurt Metzger.
I do love Kurt.

3908
02:53:54,390 --> 02:53:55,000
Yeah.
Great Guy.

3909
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:58,450
He grew up Jehovah's witness,
so you know,

3910
02:53:58,451 --> 02:54:02,830
he's super resistant to any like 
enforced ideology and he was like,

3911
02:54:02,831 --> 02:54:02,950
no,
no,

3912
02:54:02,951 --> 02:54:03,100
no,
no.

3913
02:54:03,101 --> 02:54:05,260
I've seen this before.
You can't tell me what's right,

3914
02:54:05,261 --> 02:54:07,300
is wrong,
and right is left and left is right.

3915
02:54:07,301 --> 02:54:08,500
He's like,
I know what you're doing.

3916
02:54:08,530 --> 02:54:13,530
I've seen this before.
I've seen this when I was a Jehovah's 

3917
02:54:13,530 --> 02:54:13,530
witness,
and it was like,

3918
02:54:13,530 --> 02:54:16,441
that's exactly what it's like.
It's like this enforcing this and in 

3919
02:54:16,441 --> 02:54:18,160
silencing debate like there's.

3920
02:54:18,210 --> 02:54:23,210
There was one of the things that was 
talked about in the Google memo that I 

3921
02:54:23,210 --> 02:54:25,411
thought was fascinating was that certain
subjects are too sacred to be discussed 

3922
02:54:25,411 --> 02:54:28,180
and that that is one of them like gender
in tech.

3923
02:54:28,570 --> 02:54:30,070
Apparently I don't work in tech 
obviously,

3924
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:33,670
but in gender in specific like any,
any women's issues,

3925
02:54:33,671 --> 02:54:38,671
you're not supposed to discuss them as a
man and a men's issue discussed by a 

3926
02:54:38,671 --> 02:54:41,370
woman is like the thought of a woman 
trying to steal your money or come up,

3927
02:54:41,630 --> 02:54:43,640
she'll sneak your divorce laws are,
you know,

3928
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:48,660
we don't want anybody having any opinion
whatsoever about a side of.

3929
02:54:48,911 --> 02:54:53,911
They're not on that list.
It limits growth and it's the opposite 

3930
02:54:53,911 --> 02:54:53,911
of science,
like scientists.

3931
02:54:53,911 --> 02:54:56,830
Science is skepticism.
The whole thing is ask why until you hit

3932
02:54:56,831 --> 02:55:01,831
a wall,
you know it isn't like to not address 

3933
02:55:01,831 --> 02:55:02,980
this and people get labeled toxic and 
just kicked out toxic.

3934
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:07,280
A dumb one.
Toxic masculinity and by the way,

3935
02:55:07,281 --> 02:55:12,281
there's a lot of women that are like 
evolutionary psychologists that know a 

3936
02:55:12,281 --> 02:55:12,800
shitload more about men than even men 
do,

3937
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:13,720
right?
Yeah,

3938
02:55:13,730 --> 02:55:18,730
sure they do and you got to listen to 
them if they're explaining the actual 

3939
02:55:18,730 --> 02:55:21,710
evolutionary mechanisms that have caused
human beings to behave a certain way and

3940
02:55:21,711 --> 02:55:26,711
why more men are inclined to favor of 
specific activities and you look at all 

3941
02:55:26,711 --> 02:55:30,311
the different numbers and variables that
you could look at in terms of like how 

3942
02:55:30,311 --> 02:55:30,680
many more men die on the job,
how many more men picked,

3943
02:55:30,950 --> 02:55:35,950
you know,
difficult job and also like this weird 

3944
02:55:35,950 --> 02:55:38,621
thing that we're doing where we're like 
trying to pretend that things are 

3945
02:55:38,621 --> 02:55:39,980
different than they really are to sort 
of support your point better.

3946
02:55:40,150 --> 02:55:42,260
Like that's one of the things that 
people do with the gender pay gap,

3947
02:55:42,261 --> 02:55:42,530
right?

3948
02:55:42,680 --> 02:55:43,610
There was one to say,
well,

3949
02:55:43,611 --> 02:55:46,690
the gender pay gap shows is real 
prejudice between men went,

3950
02:55:46,691 --> 02:55:46,930
no,
no,

3951
02:55:46,931 --> 02:55:51,931
no.
It's not what it shows it all kind of 

3952
02:55:51,931 --> 02:55:53,351
thing.
It shows that women and men choose 

3953
02:55:53,351 --> 02:55:55,031
different jobs and and when I told a 
good buddy of mine that he didn't 

3954
02:55:55,031 --> 02:55:55,031
believe it,
he was like,

3955
02:55:55,031 --> 02:55:56,420
there's no way I go,
that's what the gender pay gap is.

3956
02:55:56,421 --> 02:55:56,990
He goes,
no,

3957
02:55:56,991 --> 02:55:59,690
I thought it was like men,
women and men doing the same job and the

3958
02:55:59,691 --> 02:56:01,250
woman makes seventy seven cents on the 
dollar.

3959
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:01,880
No,
no,

3960
02:56:01,970 --> 02:56:03,290
no.
That would be horrible.

3961
02:56:03,291 --> 02:56:04,130
Right?
That's not what it is.

3962
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:09,370
They choose different jobs.
I look at men and women doing the same 

3963
02:56:09,370 --> 02:56:09,890
job.
The difference is very small and when he

3964
02:56:09,891 --> 02:56:11,900
found that he was angry,
he was like,

3965
02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:14,330
are you fucking serious to me?
I got pissed.

3966
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:19,360
You get sick,
you get mad because you hear the 

3967
02:56:19,360 --> 02:56:20,771
president,
President Obama was talking about that 

3968
02:56:20,771 --> 02:56:20,771
on television.

3969
02:56:20,771 --> 02:56:21,530
Surely someone must have alerted him.
Mr.

3970
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:23,570
President,
this is disingenuous line of,

3971
02:56:23,571 --> 02:56:24,140
thank you,
Mr.

3972
02:56:24,230 --> 02:56:25,510
President.
This is nonsense.

3973
02:56:25,511 --> 02:56:30,511
It's not.
It's like they took every man and woman 

3974
02:56:30,511 --> 02:56:32,030
and just put a line at the 50th 
percentile and anyone who knows anything

3975
02:56:32,031 --> 02:56:33,440
about math,
that's insane.

3976
02:56:33,930 --> 02:56:36,560
Like there's so many factors.
Just the factor of having a child.

3977
02:56:36,620 --> 02:56:38,750
Oh yeah,
like so then you quit for 10 years,

3978
02:56:38,751 --> 02:56:40,190
you come back,
you're going to make less money.

3979
02:56:40,191 --> 02:56:43,400
That all goes into the pay gap thing or 
if he even quit for a few months.

3980
02:56:43,401 --> 02:56:44,120
I mean,
you know,

3981
02:56:44,210 --> 02:56:46,370
whatever it is,
the time that you have to take off,

3982
02:56:46,371 --> 02:56:50,060
that's going to.
And then women work less frequent hours.

3983
02:56:50,061 --> 02:56:51,900
They work less hours.
Whether they,

3984
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:55,280
they take less overtime.
It doesn't mean that they're not just as

3985
02:56:55,281 --> 02:56:57,620
good at a job as a man.
Is that a job?

3986
02:56:57,621 --> 02:57:02,621
It just means that overall they're 
probably going to earn less money in 

3987
02:57:02,621 --> 02:57:02,621
that sort of scenario.

3988
02:57:02,621 --> 02:57:03,950
They choose different jobs,
they work less hours.

3989
02:57:04,280 --> 02:57:06,770
That's just.
I'm not saying that that's the,

3990
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:12,040
you know,
they don't get some sort of 

3991
02:57:12,040 --> 02:57:13,271
discrimination.
I wouldn't want to be a chick work with 

3992
02:57:13,271 --> 02:57:13,271
a bunch of dudes.
I wouldn't want to be that.

3993
02:57:13,271 --> 02:57:14,750
That's a different argument.
I think women working with.

3994
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:15,920
God,
I think there'll be terrible,

3995
02:57:15,921 --> 02:57:18,380
especially if you're attractive,
if you're attractive women,

3996
02:57:18,620 --> 02:57:23,620
you've got to work with like 10 
dickheads at some stupid fucking ups 

3997
02:57:23,620 --> 02:57:24,560
office.
I bet it sucks.

3998
02:57:24,710 --> 02:57:29,710
I bet those guys are annoying as fuck.
They say stupid shit about you behind 

3999
02:57:29,710 --> 02:57:29,710
your back.
You know?

4000
02:57:29,710 --> 02:57:32,180
I'm sure it's horrible,
but that's a different argument.

4001
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:33,380
One hundred percent.
It's not.

4002
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:34,730
It's not saying,
okay,

4003
02:57:34,731 --> 02:57:37,220
we're not saying that there's not some 
discrimination.

4004
02:57:37,221 --> 02:57:42,221
I'm sure there is,
but that's not saying that that's 

4005
02:57:42,221 --> 02:57:45,431
happening in tech to the point where 
there's a reason why there's 10 men and 

4006
02:57:45,711 --> 02:57:46,850
for women that's not.

4007
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:49,670
That doesn't necessarily make sense and 
as soon as you do that,

4008
02:57:49,671 --> 02:57:51,290
like what you said,
equality of outcome.

4009
02:57:51,550 --> 02:57:53,090
Yeah,
that's the perfect way to describe it.

4010
02:57:53,300 --> 02:57:53,940
Yeah,
because it it,

4011
02:57:53,970 --> 02:57:57,710
it guarantees that you're going to have 
a problem and it also the biggest victim

4012
02:57:57,711 --> 02:58:02,711
or women that feel like they have to be 
a CEO and a mom to be like normal and 

4013
02:58:03,541 --> 02:58:08,541
it's like that's an impossible position 
to put somebody in where it's like if 

4014
02:58:08,541 --> 02:58:10,560
your instinct wants a child but you 
don't want to slip at work at all,

4015
02:58:10,561 --> 02:58:12,940
it's like dude workings for pilots.
I,

4016
02:58:13,050 --> 02:58:16,050
my wife made life with her body and I'm 
just like,

4017
02:58:16,260 --> 02:58:17,190
oh,
do the funny bone.

4018
02:58:17,191 --> 02:58:18,990
Here's more money.
It's like,

4019
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:24,260
I agree,
but I also could see it from the point 

4020
02:58:24,260 --> 02:58:24,260
of view from a woman who doesn't want 
that new law.

4021
02:58:24,260 --> 02:58:26,130
Of course I'm just talking probability 
just effect.

4022
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:28,320
They have a womb.
Is gonna Affect Profitability,

4023
02:58:28,580 --> 02:58:29,940
you know?
Even if it's one percent.

4024
02:58:29,941 --> 02:58:31,260
Yeah.
It's like if it's one percent,

4025
02:58:31,410 --> 02:58:35,940
I would never tell a woman that she has 
to have kids or not pursue any life that

4026
02:58:35,941 --> 02:58:37,410
they want.
Not at all.

4027
02:58:37,630 --> 02:58:39,210
Why don't think anybody should tell 
anybody what to do.

4028
02:58:39,270 --> 02:58:40,680
I mean,
that's the whole point of all this,

4029
02:58:41,190 --> 02:58:45,460
but I think we should also stop 
pretending that there's not some sort of

4030
02:58:45,461 --> 02:58:48,630
a meritocracy going on when it comes to 
most corporations,

4031
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:50,310
most jobs,
you know,

4032
02:58:50,311 --> 02:58:52,710
whatever discrimination that there is,
boy,

4033
02:58:52,711 --> 02:58:57,711
I really hope that gets routed out so we
can concentrate on what's important and 

4034
02:58:57,711 --> 02:59:01,150
what's important is people finding 
something they enjoy and doing it 

4035
02:59:01,150 --> 02:59:01,150
without discrimination and doing it 
without,

4036
02:59:01,490 --> 02:59:06,490
you know,
having to deal with too much resistance 

4037
02:59:06,490 --> 02:59:06,490
from the people that you're doing it 
with,

4038
02:59:06,490 --> 02:59:06,490
you know,
and that's,

4039
02:59:06,490 --> 02:59:06,490
that's a harmonious life,
right?

4040
02:59:06,490 --> 02:59:11,240
Find something you love,
find some sort of a path of least 

4041
02:59:11,240 --> 02:59:14,181
resistance to get to it.
We can really enjoy it and participate 

4042
02:59:14,181 --> 02:59:14,181
in it.
Hopefully with likeminded people.

4043
02:59:14,550 --> 02:59:19,550
Like one of the things that I've always 
been really happy about the store and 

4044
02:59:19,550 --> 02:59:20,050
about standup comedy in general is that 
there,

4045
02:59:20,060 --> 02:59:25,060
it's a brotherhood and a sisterhood.
Like when Whitney Cummings comes around 

4046
02:59:25,060 --> 02:59:28,401
the comedy store,
she's as much my brother or sister as 

4047
02:59:28,401 --> 02:59:31,910
any of the other guys.
It's Andrew Santina was one of these 

4048
02:59:31,910 --> 02:59:31,910
guys.
We're,

4049
02:59:31,910 --> 02:59:34,871
we're a family there.
Of course there's not a whole lot of us 

4050
02:59:34,871 --> 02:59:38,180
is very few and if you get through and 
you're funny if you're Sarah Silverman 

4051
02:59:38,180 --> 02:59:38,370
or you know,
name that personally you're treated with

4052
02:59:38,371 --> 02:59:39,870
the same amount of respect that guys 
are,

4053
02:59:39,930 --> 02:59:44,930
at least I would hope,
at least in the circles are the people 

4054
02:59:44,930 --> 02:59:44,930
that I enjoy.
You are.

4055
02:59:44,930 --> 02:59:44,930
Yeah.
At least you're,

4056
02:59:44,930 --> 02:59:49,801
you,
I mean you were held up to the same 

4057
02:59:49,801 --> 02:59:49,801
standards as well,
you know,

4058
02:59:49,801 --> 02:59:52,200
and you're also like,
like if you ask people like who's funny?

4059
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:54,000
The we,
we like funny people,

4060
02:59:54,380 --> 02:59:55,470
you know,
like if you say like,

4061
02:59:56,010 --> 03:00:01,010
Hey,
did you see Sarah do said in the main 

4062
03:00:01,010 --> 03:00:01,010
room,
Holy Shit,

4063
03:00:01,010 --> 03:00:01,780
the fucking crush dude.
Like people tell you in sight,

4064
03:00:01,990 --> 03:00:06,990
there's no sexism when it comes to that.
It's a total results based appreciations

4065
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:08,100
standard.
Yeah.

4066
03:00:08,101 --> 03:00:09,810
It's like fighting and comedies the same
way.

4067
03:00:09,811 --> 03:00:14,811
The stakes are so high you,
you develop a no nonsense vibe where 

4068
03:00:14,811 --> 03:00:14,811
it's like,
dude,

4069
03:00:14,811 --> 03:00:19,551
bombing sucks.
So like I can't say like I have to just 

4070
03:00:19,551 --> 03:00:20,220
be like,
what joke is funny,

4071
03:00:20,221 --> 03:00:22,380
like I can't do the nonsense.
Just like with fighting,

4072
03:00:22,381 --> 03:00:27,240
it's like well if you commit to just 
taekwondo and not do the full package of

4073
03:00:27,241 --> 03:00:29,610
Jujitsu and all that shit,
like you're at a disadvantage.

4074
03:00:29,880 --> 03:00:34,880
So it's like that all like that.
That identity can hurt you if you don't 

4075
03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:35,640
branch out into like what works,
you know?

4076
03:00:35,641 --> 03:00:36,870
I don't know shit about fighting 
obviously,

4077
03:00:36,871 --> 03:00:41,871
but I've just heard you talk about like 
it just that well rounded grappling and 

4078
03:00:41,871 --> 03:00:46,101
striking and all that shit.
Like the stakes are so high that you 

4079
03:00:46,101 --> 03:00:49,341
can't really be nonsense.
The only other option is going to be a 

4080
03:00:49,341 --> 03:00:51,540
specialist at such a high level that you
better than everybody else at one thing.

4081
03:00:51,980 --> 03:00:56,980
Like you get with this Guy Damien Maia 
who just last actually two guys more 

4082
03:00:57,241 --> 03:01:01,060
well rounded ironically,
but he's been able to beat so many world

4083
03:01:01,061 --> 03:01:03,340
class fighters just because he's so 
amazing at Jujitsu.

4084
03:01:03,341 --> 03:01:08,341
It gets a hold of guys,
drags him to the ground and either 

4085
03:01:08,341 --> 03:01:10,651
strangles them or it gets really close 
to strangle them to the point where he 

4086
03:01:10,651 --> 03:01:10,651
dominates all the exchanges.

4087
03:01:10,651 --> 03:01:14,580
He's done that with like,
I think you beat six or seven guys in a 

4088
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:16,240
row and really good guys by really 
Carlos Condit,

4089
03:01:16,241 --> 03:01:18,460
former interim welterweight champion,
strangled them,

4090
03:01:18,470 --> 03:01:19,580
got them on the ground,
choked him out.

4091
03:01:19,930 --> 03:01:21,790
So it's like there's a few guys that can
do that,

4092
03:01:21,791 --> 03:01:23,740
but for the most part you've got to be 
able to do everything.

4093
03:01:24,130 --> 03:01:25,120
And I think,
um,

4094
03:01:25,420 --> 03:01:29,890
if you have blind spots when it comes to
like things that you,

4095
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:32,540
if you're like a,
if you're a,

4096
03:01:32,930 --> 03:01:37,930
you have a blind spot,
the blind spot is you don't respect 

4097
03:01:37,930 --> 03:01:37,930
women or you have a blind spot.
You don't,

4098
03:01:37,930 --> 03:01:39,670
you don't like black people or you don't
like gay people.

4099
03:01:39,671 --> 03:01:41,100
If you have a real blind spot,
like a real,

4100
03:01:41,410 --> 03:01:43,750
that's going to emanate through all your
thinking.

4101
03:01:43,780 --> 03:01:48,780
Totally.
It's gonna fuck up your logic and how 

4102
03:01:48,780 --> 03:01:51,361
you look at anything that happens in the
world that you tried to turn it into a 

4103
03:01:51,361 --> 03:01:52,300
bit,
that prejudice thinking like if you,

4104
03:01:52,330 --> 03:01:56,470
if you think you have that kind of a 
stupid hate and anger or resentment,

4105
03:01:56,680 --> 03:02:01,680
whatever it is in your mind,
we not thinking clearly you're going to 

4106
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:04,191
miss things.
You're not gonna be as good as you want 

4107
03:02:04,191 --> 03:02:04,300
to be.
It's going to be at your best.

4108
03:02:04,700 --> 03:02:08,480
That's why I do a podcast.
Why didn't they laugh for like,

4109
03:02:08,481 --> 03:02:09,680
I literally just,
Ah,

4110
03:02:09,800 --> 03:02:11,930
I don't always do it because I'm not 
always on the road,

4111
03:02:11,931 --> 03:02:16,931
but I'll,
I'll just show bombs and just almost 

4112
03:02:16,931 --> 03:02:16,940
like,
it's like sports where I'm like,

4113
03:02:16,941 --> 03:02:21,941
why didn't that work?
And it motivated me to try shit a lot 

4114
03:02:21,941 --> 03:02:22,040
because I was like,
okay,

4115
03:02:22,041 --> 03:02:25,250
I got an hour,
I gotta want to do another hour.

4116
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:27,050
So let's make it fun.
That like,

4117
03:02:27,080 --> 03:02:28,100
I get to be like,
oh,

4118
03:02:28,101 --> 03:02:29,900
this one was on me.
I rushed this one,

4119
03:02:30,830 --> 03:02:33,710
this tag offended Miami,
you know,

4120
03:02:33,711 --> 03:02:37,190
like shit like that.
Like where it's humbling to re listen to

4121
03:02:37,191 --> 03:02:40,010
yourself and show up.
Like I did a documentary,

4122
03:02:40,011 --> 03:02:45,011
60 minutes and seven days where I wrote 
a new hour and a week just to remember 

4123
03:02:45,171 --> 03:02:45,850
that.
Yeah,

4124
03:02:45,970 --> 03:02:47,600
that a few years back,
right when you're out here.

4125
03:02:47,890 --> 03:02:50,810
My wife was pregnant so I was like maybe
two years maybe.

4126
03:02:51,110 --> 03:02:55,430
And so it would just be like,
watch me just struggle,

4127
03:02:55,700 --> 03:02:58,880
you know?
And I maybe got 15 minutes out of it,

4128
03:02:58,881 --> 03:03:01,490
but it was just like heavy bag were 
amazing though.

4129
03:03:01,520 --> 03:03:03,260
You got 15 minutes and that short of a 
time,

4130
03:03:03,261 --> 03:03:06,590
like how long would it take you to make 
15 minutes in a normal time.

4131
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:10,580
I mean if I'm in the wrong mindset like 
we discussed that could do that for 3:30

4132
03:03:10,581 --> 03:03:11,810
years.
You see guys do that,

4133
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:14,870
you know,
if you're in the mindset of like,

4134
03:03:14,900 --> 03:03:17,270
oh this work,
so I'm just going to do that.

4135
03:03:17,271 --> 03:03:19,310
But if you're in the growth mindset,
you're like,

4136
03:03:19,640 --> 03:03:21,350
because I love doing new shit,
you know?

4137
03:03:21,530 --> 03:03:26,530
Well,
isn't it interesting like you coming 

4138
03:03:26,530 --> 03:03:26,530
from a music background,
like you know you've been playing piano,

4139
03:03:26,530 --> 03:03:27,860
like you said,
as long as you can remember,

4140
03:03:28,100 --> 03:03:30,260
that requires practice,
right?

4141
03:03:30,261 --> 03:03:31,610
It requires 10 hours a day.

4142
03:03:31,620 --> 03:03:36,620
Yeah.
You have to be dedicated and sit down a 

4143
03:03:36,620 --> 03:03:38,411
practice.
That is one of the major things that 

4144
03:03:38,411 --> 03:03:38,510
comedians lack.
They don't practice.

4145
03:03:38,570 --> 03:03:39,620
We don't,
right.

4146
03:03:40,090 --> 03:03:41,930
We don't sit down and go over the 
material.

4147
03:03:41,931 --> 03:03:46,931
We don't listen to the old recordings.
Like when I forced myself into doing 

4148
03:03:46,931 --> 03:03:50,561
that just four or five times a week,
just forced myself for an hour at a 

4149
03:03:50,561 --> 03:03:50,561
time.
It's like a giant accomplishment,

4150
03:03:50,561 --> 03:03:54,590
you know?
Sometimes it hurts to listen to old sets

4151
03:03:54,591 --> 03:03:57,110
like oh my God,
just the mistakes.

4152
03:03:57,140 --> 03:03:58,970
And like even when you were like,
okay,

4153
03:03:58,971 --> 03:04:03,971
there was a crazy bomb in that one.
It's going to make for a great episode 

4154
03:04:03,971 --> 03:04:05,270
and then like my instincts are like,
you don't want to relive that man.

4155
03:04:06,700 --> 03:04:08,030
That's like that.
That's where I party.

4156
03:04:08,031 --> 03:04:08,640
Like dude,
I got,

4157
03:04:08,710 --> 03:04:12,590
I got spit on on Christmas.
It didn't make a video about that.

4158
03:04:12,620 --> 03:04:16,250
Yeah.
I saw that video and it was like,

4159
03:04:17,260 --> 03:04:22,260
you know,
there's a strong instinct of me to put 

4160
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:25,151
out my best shit all the time.
But like part of me also wants to be 

4161
03:04:25,151 --> 03:04:26,290
like this.
This also happens,

4162
03:04:27,420 --> 03:04:29,700
you know,
like even like Shit,

4163
03:04:29,740 --> 03:04:30,910
you know,
I'll be playing like,

4164
03:04:31,400 --> 03:04:36,400
like Beethoven,
like my blinkers on with like with like 

4165
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:38,900
jokes and it'll just die and I'm like,
why didn't they laugh?

4166
03:04:38,930 --> 03:04:43,930
People are in India.
They just decide somewhere along the 

4167
03:04:43,930 --> 03:04:43,930
line,
I don't want this guy.

4168
03:04:43,930 --> 03:04:43,930
Oh,
too tall.

4169
03:04:43,930 --> 03:04:45,610
Fermentation is fuck this guy wearing a 
suit.

4170
03:04:45,810 --> 03:04:50,810
It was some kind of Gig.
Probably anti white power probably 

4171
03:04:51,231 --> 03:04:52,610
doesn't even have a tattoo on his 
forehead.

4172
03:04:52,760 --> 03:04:56,030
Where's your fucking swastika on your 
street?

4173
03:04:56,120 --> 03:04:58,190
I was a kid,
the city once I walked out in a suit and

4174
03:04:58,191 --> 03:05:00,990
someone yelled,
faggot before I said one word woe.

4175
03:05:02,060 --> 03:05:05,310
Good club literally just goes,
like I said,

4176
03:05:05,330 --> 03:05:07,100
one word.
Good work environment.

4177
03:05:07,130 --> 03:05:08,570
Yeah.
Imagine any other job.

4178
03:05:08,571 --> 03:05:10,730
We show up for work and they just scream
faggot at ya.

4179
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:13,700
And they paid to be there.
It's called systemic oppression.

4180
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:16,850
Just any other job.
That would never be insane.

4181
03:05:16,910 --> 03:05:18,490
Just people throw shit at you.
Yeah.

4182
03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:20,300
Imagine if you will.
A school teacher did.

4183
03:05:20,301 --> 03:05:23,330
I used to be a heckler to renaissance 
festival in stock.

4184
03:05:23,331 --> 03:05:24,410
Yeah.
That was my high school job.

4185
03:05:24,440 --> 03:05:26,330
That's a lyric.
People were throwing tomatoes in my face

4186
03:05:26,390 --> 03:05:28,670
all day long and you had mock them,
mock them.

4187
03:05:28,850 --> 03:05:31,580
That's what I learned.
I learned to mock what people have pride

4188
03:05:31,581 --> 03:05:33,410
in.
Not what is where.

4189
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:36,680
It's like a 400 pound man.
Fatness doesn't matter.

4190
03:05:36,681 --> 03:05:40,250
Someone 10 pounds overweight.
It will crush him.

4191
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:42,310
Woo.
Yeah.

4192
03:05:42,311 --> 03:05:45,190
Where?
It's a little fucking soft in the middle

4193
03:05:45,200 --> 03:05:45,880
there,
Michael.

4194
03:05:46,070 --> 03:05:49,640
Yeah.
Your wife's too hot for you?

4195
03:05:49,641 --> 03:05:51,950
I'm fucking young.
Mean Tick Tock Tick Tock,

4196
03:05:51,980 --> 03:05:56,980
you know,
they freak out because I was getting 

4197
03:05:56,980 --> 03:05:56,980
paid based on the tomato thrown.
Oh,

4198
03:05:56,980 --> 03:06:00,320
dollars a tomato.
It was $5 for three tomatoes and my goal

4199
03:06:00,321 --> 03:06:01,500
is always to beat the house.

4200
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:08,920
And Dude,
I used to get drunk on meade and just 

4201
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:10,550
let people slap me in the face for $20,
$20 a full power slap.

4202
03:06:10,970 --> 03:06:15,970
I would,
I would judge the man but like it would 

4203
03:06:15,970 --> 03:06:19,241
be like,
because people wouldn't be able to hit 

4204
03:06:19,241 --> 03:06:19,241
me if I got in their head.
They just like throw it into the ground,

4205
03:06:19,700 --> 03:06:21,170
like once you own it.
So mad.

4206
03:06:21,171 --> 03:06:22,580
But my,
my friends,

4207
03:06:22,680 --> 03:06:23,780
uh,
I was like Kurt Metzger,

4208
03:06:23,810 --> 03:06:25,010
you know,
it didn't fall for the shit.

4209
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:30,340
Like I'd be like you.
And it's like now we know you're just 

4210
03:06:30,340 --> 03:06:32,500
owing on leash.
That's Larry.

4211
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:36,080
That's funny dude.
I gotta wrap this up because it's almost

4212
03:06:36,081 --> 03:06:36,840
5:00.
Wow.

4213
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:38,460
Time flew by.
So this is great.

4214
03:06:38,461 --> 03:06:41,330
It's four hours and 15 minutes.
About 15 minutes.

4215
03:06:41,410 --> 03:06:42,840
It's definitely a highlight of something
like that.

4216
03:06:42,870 --> 03:06:43,820
My Week.
Dude.

4217
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,590
Thank you very much man.
I really enjoyed it.

4218
03:06:45,591 --> 03:06:47,930
It was fun.
We should do it again for sure.

4219
03:06:47,990 --> 03:06:48,920
Anytime.
Oh,

4220
03:06:48,930 --> 03:06:50,990
tell people how to find you on 
instagram.

4221
03:06:50,991 --> 03:06:51,770
Twitter,
log jobs.

4222
03:06:51,830 --> 03:06:56,830
Huge pianist.com.
And Add Dns to pee in piano player.

4223
03:06:58,380 --> 03:06:59,220
Yeah.
I Got Dallas,

4224
03:06:59,221 --> 03:07:01,260
Plano in the United Kingdom and Ireland 
coming up.

4225
03:07:01,370 --> 03:07:02,200
Beautiful.
Yeah.

4226
03:07:02,550 --> 03:07:03,280
Funny Dude.
Oh,

4227
03:07:03,300 --> 03:07:04,320
I'm Benjamin.
Ladies and gentlemen.

4228
03:07:04,970 --> 03:07:09,970
Can I say tomorrow?
Black.
