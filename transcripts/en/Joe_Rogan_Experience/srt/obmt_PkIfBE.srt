1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,170
Yeah,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,980
the Joe Rogan experience your podcast.
First of all,

3
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:11,984
thanks for doing this.
I found out about you several years 

4
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:16,184
back.
I had heard something about 

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,703
toxoplasmosis.
Sandra and I had seen a speech that 

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,780
you'd given on it where you were talking
about how many people have been infected

7
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:29,744
by this campaign.
I've had cats my whole life and I even 

8
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:32,684
had feral cats and I've always wondered 
like I should probably get tested and 

9
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm worried about the result.
Well,

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
it was just fascinating to me that 
literally,

11
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,234
I mean,
what is the number that you estimate in 

12
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,500
Americans alone that might have been 
infected?

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,440
It's on the order of,
well,

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,633
I'm not sure what the Americans,
but worldwide it's something like 50 

15
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:54,774
percent of humans is the best guess.
Fifty percent of humans wrote one thing 

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,250
on that scale.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,400
Have for people they never heard of 
this.

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,263
Would you mind explaining what this 
parasite is and how it affects rats and 

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,170
cats and then people?

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,670
Okay,
totally bizarre.

21
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:09,950
So it's this,
this protozoan parasite,

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,413
Toxoplasma Gondii,
and it's got one of these weird 

23
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:14,804
parasitic lifestyles.
The only place on earth where it could 

24
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:20,090
reproduce sexually is in the god of a 
cat.

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,810
I don't know why there are people who 
know this,

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,160
but so it reproduces their comes out in 
the cat feces,

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,053
feces or eaten by rodents and now talks.
Those evolutionary challenge is to get 

28
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:34,064
that road and it into a cat stomach.
So what talkshow has evolved is this 

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,513
ability.
It's slowly migrates to the brain of 

30
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:46,871
rodents and basically wipes out the 
innate fear that rodents have of cat.

31
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:53,561
Smells like you take a lab rat who's 
been like the descendant of lab rats for

32
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,094
like a thousand years,
have never seen a cat and put like a 

33
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,100
Little Puddle of Cat pee in its cage and
the rent's going to go on the other side

34
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:01,934
of the case.
Just hardwired instinctual aversion to 

35
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:05,594
cat pheromones and then put toxin in a 
rat and it loses that aversion and in 

36
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:11,474
fact it was sunset of rat.
They liked the smell so out in the 

37
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:16,064
natural setting that you now go and 
approach a cat and certainly rutins 

38
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,930
inside the cat's stomach and toxin was 
completed its lifecycle.

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,120
Well,
I had heard that it was a,

40
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,093
so it's a subset of rats that,
that actually are gravitated towards it 

41
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,960
because I've heard it actually rewires 
them sexually.

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,180
Yes.
That,

43
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,910
that's actually work that we did in my 
lab,

44
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,290
that it basically crosses some of the 
circuitry in the brain,

45
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,213
the hypothalamus,
so that cat pheromones that used to be 

46
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:47,290
activating every alarm circuit in 
Europe,

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,143
like Olympic system,
and these rodents now instead sort of 

48
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,644
taps into sexual arousal pathways.
And in male rats when they smelled cat 

49
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,640
pheromones,
they increase testosterone production.

50
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,560
Um,
so talk,

51
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,590
so has just figured out the most 
brilliant way of doing it.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,840
It makes cat pee,
smell sexy.

53
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,790
Do.
Is there any understanding at all of the

54
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,624
mechanism of how a parasite can figure 
out how to rewire an animals sexual 

55
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,460
reward system?
The fear of predators?

56
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,840
Like how does that work?

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,170
Well,
that's something my lab spent a bunch of

58
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,990
years on.
I'm trying to figure out,

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,730
when you look at some of these 
parasites,

60
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,653
this taps into this whole world of 
behavioral manipulation of hosts by 

61
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:35,694
parasites.
And turns out they've evolved 

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,353
unbelievably brilliant mechanisms for 
manipulating hosts for their own 

63
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:43,770
benefit.
I mean,

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,350
think about it.
You get rabies,

65
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,184
you hit a rabid dog.
And what that's about is a virus that 

66
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:51,414
has affected the nervous system of that 
dog so that it's now rabbit and more 

67
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:59,610
likely to bite somebody with viral 
particles in it,

68
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:00,444
saliva,
which ad now passes onto the next 

69
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,384
individual like you take 10,000 
neuroscientists and stick them in a 

70
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,110
convention on the neurobiology of 
aggression.

71
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,093
And rabies knows more about the neuro 
watering of aggression than we do and 

72
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,920
talk.
So knows quotation marks,

73
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,053
uh,
something about fear and aversion and 

74
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,870
the neurobiology of attraction.

75
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,973
Part of what it seems to involve his 
toxo somewhere along the way has picked 

76
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:35,631
up a gene that is pertinent to the 
dopamine system in mammals.

77
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,070
Dopa Munis,
this neurotransmitter,

78
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:39,810
it's about pleasure.
Um,

79
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,693
there is no protozoan parasite for 
building years that's had any use for 

80
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:47,370
this stuff,
except it's part of how toxo seems to be

81
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,090
manipulating the reward system in 
rodents.

82
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,973
And then couple of years ago there's 
paper showing that in chimpanzees toxo 

83
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,180
makes you less afraid of the smell of 
leopards.

84
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,633
So this appears to be a parasite that 
just has evolved like this spectacular 

85
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:08,694
insight into fear circuitry and 
attraction circuitry and it's all for 

86
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,390
its own benefit to wind up in a casket.

87
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,683
So it's specifically cats,
like do the chimpanzees still have 

88
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:21,490
aversions to snakes and other things 
that can kill them?

89
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,363
Yep.
Yeah.

90
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,713
And at one point in my lab was full of 
like all cat key and wolf pen because 

91
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,080
actually like accompany you could buy 
urine from um,

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,710
I don't know why anyone would want it 
except for us.

93
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,820
Um,
but they,

94
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:38,654
so urine from actually what they use it 
for is you can go spritz it around your 

95
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,620
garden to scare the deer away.
You have stuff.

96
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:46,454
So there's,
I don't know where they get the urine 

97
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,274
from,
but it's like from certified and all of 

98
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:53,660
that.
Um,

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,000
and yeah,
it's remarkably specific.

100
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,010
So like other,
have they

101
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,843
ever done tests where they chest,
like wolf urine or anything like that 

102
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,010
around chimps?
Do they have any aversion to that?

103
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,150
Um,
as far as I know,

104
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,870
the chimps study,

105
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,610
he's only been with big cafeteria,
but the rubin studies exactly that,

106
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,444
showing it's a fair specificity.
The rodents lose a little bit of their 

107
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,634
general skittishness a,
they get a little bit disinhibited 

108
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,040
behaviorally.
So just in general,

109
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,250
they're out more and more exploratory,
more likely to get eaten.

110
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,113
But the most selective lasering effect 
is they're not scared anymore of cat 

111
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:31,244
pheromones.

112
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,373
Now,
what's fascinating to me is that I've 

113
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,630
also read that,
um,

114
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,663
there was a disproportionate amount of 
successful soccer teams that are in 

115
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,310
countries with high rates of infestation
of Toxoplasma.

116
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,170
Okay,
that one's good.

117
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,650
That one's new to me,
but that,

118
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,550
that sounds like exactly the sort of 
epidemiological studies that are popping

119
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,460
up about humans,
right?

120
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,480
So worry about humans.
Um,

121
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,970
there's two branches of interesting 
stuff with toxin when humans.

122
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,103
One is a literature that's been around 
for quite some time showing that 

123
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:10,460
talkshow seems to increase the risk of 
schizophrenia.

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,153
There's a higher rate of schizophrenia,
of individuals who have antibodies 

125
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,950
against toxo.
In other words,

126
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:22,520
sometime in the past and their body was 
dealing with it.

127
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,370
Um,
who had cats growing up,

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
whose mother had cats during pregnancy,
and like anybody who gets pregnant knows

129
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:32,234
you immediately get all anxious about 
cat litter boxes because of possibility 

130
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,510
of toxoplasmosis.
It can attack the field,

131
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,430
nervous system,
do all sorts of damage,

132
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,700
and a subtle version of it seems to be a
sleeper effect of increasing the risk of

133
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,680
schizophrenia.
Um,

134
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,920
the other realm is toxo infected humans 
get subtle changes in personality,

135
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,060
neuropsychology,
sort of neuropsychological profiles.

136
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,300
They get a little bit disinhibited if 
you're talk,

137
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,143
so infected,
your more likely to die in a car 

138
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:07,754
accident involving reckless speeding.
If you're talking to infected and 

139
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,230
clinically depressed for the same 
severity of depression,

140
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:18,530
you're more likely to impulsively kill 
yourself.

141
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,040
Now the words talks.
Who's doing something kind of similar?

142
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,100
If you're a rat,
one of the hardest wired,

143
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:27,830
scary things in the universe out there 
as the smell of the cat.

144
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,993
If you are human,
it's hurdling through space really fast 

145
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,374
and jumping out of windows.
And toxo seems to blunt a lot of those 

146
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,290
effects there

147
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,700
in this.
Um,

148
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,740
the,
the speech that I saw you give,

149
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:43,574
you were talking about your time working
in a hospital and that there was a 

150
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,490
disproportionate amount of motorcycle 
victims.

151
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,990
This was actually

152
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,630
something I heard from a clinician,
a,

153
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,503
a,
uh,

154
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,990
no hold sort of parasitology infectious 
disease doctor who sort of,

155
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,050
when I was first telling him about this 
sort of the merchant toxic story,

156
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,010
he had like one of these bolts of memory
saying,

157
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,110
my God,
I remember back when I was a resident,

158
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,720
there is this old doctor saying,
you know,

159
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:16,050
if you're ever harvesting organs from an
accident victim,

160
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,780
I don't know why.
I don't know why,

161
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,960
but if it's from somebody who was in a 
motorcycle accident,

162
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,260
make sure you check to see if they have 
toxoplasmosis.

163
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,423
I don't know why that there's a high 
rate of that that you find in Oregon's 

164
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,720
from people who were killed driving 
motorcycles recklessly.

165
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,130
Totally anecdotal and equals one kind of
thing.

166
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,510
But nonetheless,
this,

167
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:44,511
this was a guy who like studies,
infectious disease and toxoplasmosis and

168
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,710
had not heard about sort of the 
behavioral findings before and that,

169
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,000
uh,
out of the recesses of his memory.

170
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,850
So what initially seemed like,
okay,

171
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,713
this is a parasite that's very 
selectively develop this lifecycle 

172
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,943
between cat stomachs and rodent brains 
and completing its lifecycle and weird 

173
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,410
when it gets into humans that have some 
behavioral effects.

174
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:08,244
Also,
this just kind of evolutionary spill 

175
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,390
over,
but then you see if it's doing something

176
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:13,224
similar between chimps and leopards 
suggesting that that lifecycle 

177
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,170
manipulation has been selected for in 
primates as well.

178
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,693
Very strange.
It's very strange and for me the 

179
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,264
strangest thing is the certainty with 
which there's a zillion viruses and 

180
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,324
bacteria and God knows what else out 
there that manipulate host behavior in 

181
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,800
ways we just haven't figured out yet or 
we just have this right.

182
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,070
We haven't discovered that particular 
one.

183
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,933
What does it do to women of a similar 
fact seems to have less severe effects 

184
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:54,480
on neuropsychological profiles of women.
Again,

185
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:58,020
the literature on this is pretty scanty 
and humans,

186
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:01,050
but it seems to have some similar 
effects but not as extreme.

187
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,543
However,
the story now gets a little bit more 

188
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:04,944
complicated and this is actually this 
fabulous scientist entree vs a WHO's my 

189
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:12,570
postdoc,
who's now a professor in Singapore who's

190
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,270
continued to study this.
Okay,

191
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,163
so normally one of the things animals 
have evolved to be really good at is 

192
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:24,390
picking up signals that somebody else's 
unhealthy,

193
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,060
like a potential mate is unhealthy.
There's sickness behavior,

194
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:33,440
there's very olfactory cues.
If you're a rodent,

195
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,293
makes perfect sense.
The last thing you want to do is to be 

196
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,800
meeting with somebody who's like Branson
infectious,

197
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,600
um,
and rodent equivalence of stds.

198
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,463
So normally sick animals,
parasite infected animals and such are 

199
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,190
detected by other rodents and avoided 
toxo does something different.

200
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,640
You get a so infected male and now he 
smells more attractive to female rodents

201
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,003
and when mating talks and gets into the 
sperm and can be transmitted to the 

202
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:08,404
female.

203
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,710
So suddenly we've got a different story 
here.

204
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,810
We started off with the parasites to 
rework.

205
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,843
Toxo was just ruthlessly exploiting the 
poor rodents for its own reproductive 

206
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:23,750
benefit and its own evolutionary selfish
gene wellbeing.

207
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,813
The now instead,
it's got elements of instead of 

208
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,634
parasitism symbiosis.
So you're male rat infested with toxo 

209
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,640
downside,
you're more likely to get eaten by a cat

210
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,713
upside,
you're more likely to pass on copies of 

211
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,710
your genes by the increased sexual 
selection.

212
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,120
So it might be in fact more of a 
balance,

213
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,970
the symbiotic relationship between male 
rats and talk.

214
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:53,710
So you know,
more research is needed,

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,553
blah blah.
It's just like cool sort of biology out 

216
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:58,590
there.

217
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,270
It's crazy.
And is it,

218
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,520
is it transferred sexually with men and 
women too,

219
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,070
as well as with rats?
I don't know.

220
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,320
I don't think it's been looked at.
Wow.

221
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,570
That seems like something I would want 
to look at right away.

222
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,870
What about organ donors?

223
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,860
Um,
other than again,

224
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,890
pure anecdotal ism that one elderly dock
somewhere back when saying watch it when

225
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:25,250
you're getting organized from like 
people killed in motorcycle accidents.

226
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,530
Beyond that,
I don't know.

227
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,573
I mean people are looking at it,
I'm sure even tasks like say if you got 

228
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,430
to liver and you know,
like you needed a liver transplant,

229
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,293
would suspect they do.
And sort of in the clinical world of 

230
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:43,160
people who worry about Toxo toxo 
pregnancy,

231
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,850
scary alarms going off.
Toxo,

232
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,740
anything else after an acute period of 
infection,

233
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,300
you have a latent toxoplasma infection.
In other words,

234
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,350
the agreed upon sort of notion there is 
toxo has called latent.

235
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:58,184
It's formed sort of these cysts that are
in dirt and you've got nothing to worry 

236
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:04,334
about that,
but the whole notion that meanwhile up 

237
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:09,530
in the nervous system,
there's effects happening there.

238
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,723
You know,
infectious disease people are thinking 

239
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:16,250
about inflammation outside in the body.
There are for them,

240
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,880
chronic toxic infection is not something
you worry about a whole lot,

241
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,020
but if it's I'm having behavioral 
effects up there in the nervous system,

242
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,660
maybe it is something to worry about.

243
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,903
Well,
it's just,

244
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,070
it's to me it's unfathomable how this 
little thing figures out how to hijack a

245
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,803
whole a whole body,
whole biological system and work it to 

246
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,090
its own desires.
It's very.

247
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,940
It's very hard for me to grasp.
Well,

248
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,230
if you think of it in terms of,
I dunno,

249
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,680
talk so has had

250
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,700
like 100,000 more generations to evolve 
its ways of exploiting mammals.

251
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,820
Mammals have had ways of fighting it 
off.

252
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,133
What's most remarkable is turns out this
is like a whole world of parasites that 

253
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,470
do bizarre,
manipulative things to their host.

254
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,290
Most of it's not in the realm of 
mammals.

255
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,124
Instead there's like some parasitic 
something or other that gets into 

256
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:22,430
barnacles and takes over their 
reproductive system so that the barnacle

257
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,240
digs a hole for them.
Them not the barnacle,

258
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,350
but the parasite to lay eggs into 
theirs.

259
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,330
You know,

260
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,480
the aquatic worms that infects the 
grasshopper makes a commit suicide.

261
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,220
Exactly.
That one's a bizarre,

262
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,593
bizarre.
There's this wasp that gets into 

263
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,550
cockroaches and takes him out to see 
you.

264
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,980
I'm fascinated by parents sites.
It'd be beyond that.

265
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:51,550
It's just,
it's so confusing to me how something.

266
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,384
I mean,
obviously you're dealing with hundreds 

267
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,240
of thousands of generations for it to 
get to this,

268
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,743
this current state,
but like how something evolves to be so 

269
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,230
effective.
Yeah.

270
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,630
It's just,
it's so confusing.

271
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,280
It's remarkable.
Um,

272
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,723
you know,
just to flip to the other end of the 

273
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:09,924
spectrum in terms of what like 
coevolution between two different 

274
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:19,440
species can be like over the last 20,000
years.

275
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,303
Look at what we've done.
We've taken wolves and turned them into 

276
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:23,004
these creatures.
We put Halloween costumes on and like 

277
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,970
finding a couple of years ago which like
floored make this hormone oxytocin,

278
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,550
which is totally trendy.
Oxytocin is completely cool.

279
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,683
Mother infant bonding is mediated by 
oxytocin pair bonding in monogamous 

280
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:41,424
species.
Oxytocin makes you more trusting and 

281
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:44,664
expressive and generous and economic 
games and oxytocin has all these pro 

282
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:50,544
social effects within a species,
but then it turns out that this hormone 

283
00:16:55,321 --> 00:16:58,530
that has spent the last,
I I know 100 million years,

284
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,620
having mothers and infants connect to 
each other emotionally.

285
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,550
When you and your beloved dog sit there 
and stare into each other's eyes,

286
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,340
you secrete oxytocin and if you pump up 
oxytocin levels and your dog,

287
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,260
it will stare at you longer and you will
stare longer back more oxytocin.

288
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,483
This is like an ancient ancient hormone 
having to do with mother infant bonding 

289
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,960
and in 20,000 years,
which is like a blink of an eye,

290
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:28,794
evolutionarily suddenly we're doing this
weird oxytocin tango thing than other 

291
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:33,954
species and other species too.
We feed and take care of and they like 

292
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,580
manipulate as wildly and to like get in 
like good dessert,

293
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:45,414
treat bones and stuff like that.
And they in turn do all sorts of 

294
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,423
wonderful stuff for our self esteem 
because they like lick us 

295
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,860
unconditionally.
And where'd that come from?

296
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,353
Just 20,000 years and you've like hijack
this ancient neuroendocrinology about 

297
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,700
like parental behavior and now it's got 
to do with this weird symbiotic thing we

298
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:10,330
involve as worked out somewhere back 
going,

299
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,950
what does it have any effect on 
friendship,

300
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,590
like a human being staring at each 
other.

301
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,513
Did that event anybody ever tested that?
I would assume people have looked at 

302
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,180
that it,
for example,

303
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,014
it strengthens monogamous bonds and 
there's literature by now looking at 

304
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,140
oxytocin has its effects by binding to 
an oxytocin receptor.

305
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,360
There's a gene for the oxytocin receptor
comes into number of variants and if you

306
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:43,770
have one particular variant that's 
associated with oxytocin and having less

307
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,604
effective women whom in your nervous 
system that's associated with less 

308
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:50,890
stable relationships.
Um,

309
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,360
so you know,
none of this stuff is deterministic.

310
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,194
Your,
your,

311
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,910
your sex life and your romantic life is 
not being determined by this one gene,

312
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:00,744
like nothing remotely resembling that,
but that's just part of the mix in 

313
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,970
there.
I was just wonder if that makes,

314
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,750
applies to like protonic friendships,
like male bonding and stuff.

315
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,510
I wonder if there's like when guys are 
out having a good time,

316
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,344
if they're also getting a good juice of 
oxytocin might guess is when you have 

317
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,430
your basic like pathetic male associate 
associativity,

318
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,603
which is like you talk about sports for 
five minutes with some guy and as a 

319
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,530
result you're willing to give up your 
life for him because like you know,

320
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:29,980
this is male male,
Bonnie.

321
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,570
I bet that's got something to do with 
oxytocin.

322
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,430
Yeah.
Made.

323
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,980
It only makes sense.
I mean,

324
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,450
how many of these different factors are 
there in manipulating human behavior?

325
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,370
I mean this is essentially your 
specialty,

326
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,450
right?
Yeah.

327
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,973
Okay,
so switching over to this part of the 

328
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,700
brain,
the frontal cortex,

329
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,460
which is just like the coolest part of 
the brand.

330
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,103
It's the most recently evolved.
We've got more of it or it's more 

331
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:57,030
complicated than us than any other 
species.

332
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,373
What is the frontal cortex do?
It makes you do the harder thing when 

333
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:04,470
it's the right thing to do.
Selfcontrol,

334
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,350
longterm planning,
gratification,

335
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:10,200
postponement,
emotional regulation,

336
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,750
all this sort of stuff.
And Frontal Cortex,

337
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,060
it's function is totally amazing how it 
does this.

338
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,193
Okay,
so another way of stating that is over 

339
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,134
and over in life,
we come to splits in the road where 

340
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,490
we've got temptations and we've got 
impulses and we've got,

341
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,200
yeah,
go for it right now.

342
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,033
You know you want it.
And the frontal cortex is critical at 

343
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:35,520
that juncture as to whether we like do 
the inane,

344
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:38,550
impulsive,
self indulgent thing that we may perhaps

345
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,403
regret for the rest of our lives.
Or if you tough it out and do the right 

346
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,130
and like what your frontal cortex does a
critical junctures,

347
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,670
like one of the most consequential 
pieces in neurobiology.

348
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,513
We've got.
So you asked what kind of things affect 

349
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,013
how well your frontal cortex is working 
in that one second where you have to 

350
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,164
decide if that person is holding a cell 
phone or a handgun and you pull a 

351
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:10,051
trigger or in that one second where you 
decide to you take this thing and run or

352
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,123
those temptations get resisted,
and so what sort of biological things 

353
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,310
affect what your frontal cortex is 
doing,

354
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,360
how hungry you are,
if you're hypoglycemic,

355
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,860
how tired you are.

356
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,843
If you're in pain,
all of those make the frontal cortex 

357
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:31,390
work not as well if you're a male,
what your testosterone levels are at the

358
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,224
time,
no surprise testosterone makes your 

359
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:34,684
frontal cortex all sluggish and stupid,
but your stress hormone levels were if 

360
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:39,994
you've been traumatized over the 
previous five months because sustained 

361
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:44,950
stress will atrophy.
The frontal cortex.

362
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,123
Uh,
wait,

363
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,790
what versions of the number of genes 
you've got,

364
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,833
how much stress hormones you were 
exposed to from your mother when you 

365
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,074
were a fetus?
How must lead there was in the water 

366
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,044
when you were a kid,
if your ancestors were nomadic 

367
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,090
pastoralists and developed a culture of 
honor,

368
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,223
what your nutritional status was when 
you were a kid and everything in 

369
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:09,280
between.
All of this coming down to Whoa,

370
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,173
there's just biological forces shaping 
what we're doing to an incredible 

371
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,244
extended.
It's the exact same story about any 

372
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,104
other part of the brain,
but this is just like one of the most 

373
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,044
dramatic ones.

374
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,123
Oh,
a moment of agency and free will and 

375
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,900
volition.
Whether or not I'm going to be to resist

376
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:29,920
this temptation or not by age five,
for example,

377
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,963
the kids socioeconomic status is already
a predictor of how much frontal 

378
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:37,360
development there is in this part of the
brain.

379
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,280
Because if you've been foolish enough in
this country to choose the wrong parents

380
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:46,810
to get born into there and you're being 
raised in poverty on the average,

381
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,110
your stress hormone levels are higher 
and as a result of that,

382
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,063
on the average,
your frontal cortex is fender and not 

383
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:57,430
developing this fast and on the average.
Already at age five,

384
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,360
you're not as good as on average.
At the hold out,

385
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,820
relieve me.
You're going to be glad you held out for

386
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,520
this longterm reward thing.
Wow.

387
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,730
Now is toxo have an effect on the 
frontal cortex?

388
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,820
I'm almost certainly that's a hot area 
of research.

389
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,340
Um,
we were originally hoping to see that.

390
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,233
Oh,
talks who was just going to laser in on 

391
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:22,384
just some key parts of the brain that 
are absolutely essential to this 

392
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:28,690
behavioral effect.
Seems to wind a more widespread.

393
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:31,840
So that was sort of makes it a tougher 
story,

394
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:32,674
but in some ways sort of impulsive 
behavior is either due to a stronger 

395
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,624
biology of impulsiveness,
which has much to do with Olympic 

396
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,690
system.
The image or a weaker biology of.

397
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,220
Hold on a second.
Are you sure?

398
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,640
This is such a great idea.
The hold on a second is this.

399
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,670
Such a great idea is the realm of the 
frontal Cortex,

400
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:59,900
so that could very readily be half of 
the equation right there.

401
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:00,803
Wow.
Now the frontal cortex is not fully 

402
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,340
online until you're what?
Twenty,

403
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,260
25.
It's like,

404
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,153
it's boggling thing.
So you just live your life like an ape 

405
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,410
until you're.
I mean,

406
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:16,530
you're deep into your adulthood,
you're responsible for yourself for over

407
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:18,300
seven years and you're.
Yep.

408
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,910
Which has some like stupefying 
implications and not just for explaining

409
00:24:24,851 --> 00:24:27,670
why your freshman roommate was the week 
that he was.

410
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,430
Is it uniform with male women?
Yeah.

411
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,663
I'm female development and maturation of
the frontal cortex configures faster of 

412
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:37,460
course,
and the males of course,

413
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,623
but nonetheless,
it's this very delayed maturation that 

414
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:42,254
has to do with,
or you're talking about with 

415
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,600
testosterone impeding it,
um,

416
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,550
seems to be a different mechanism there,
but just in general,

417
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,443
so brain.
So he wants it says that testosterone 

418
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,310
impedes it and then there's something 
that's as well.

419
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,270
Sure does not help,
but it's this completely.

420
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,453
Well,
it's basically the explanation for why 

421
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:02,524
adolescents are adolescent.
They have a brain that's going full 

422
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,124
blast,
especially the dopamine system with 

423
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,274
reward and sensation seeking and novelty
seeking anticipation and a frontal 

424
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:15,394
cortex that's like half baked at that 
point and is not very good at 

425
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,284
controlling impulses.
That's why adolescents are the way they 

426
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:25,264
are.
So to sort of really interesting 

427
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:29,524
implications with that.
First one is sort of in the kind of big 

428
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:37,741
picture legal implications realm.
This fact that the frontal cortex is not

429
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:43,921
fully developed until you're in your mid
twenties was implicitly the main driving

430
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:44,794
force around the supreme court some 
years ago saying you can't execute 

431
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:48,934
somebody for a crime they did before age
18 and you can't put them behind bars 

432
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:54,814
for the rest of life without a chance of
parole because their frontal cortex 

433
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:00,850
isn't quite there yet.
Of course,

434
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:01,684
the flaw with that thinking is the 
presumption that magically on the very 

435
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,900
morning of your 18th birthday,
you suddenly have a spanking new frontal

436
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:12,790
cortex that like as a memorized all 
those Sunday morning sermons and can get

437
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:13,624
you to do the right thing,
but at least the courts have implicitly 

438
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:20,950
recognized that brain maturation,
parentheses,

439
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:21,843
frontal cortex is such that adolescent 
impulse control is not what you see in 

440
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:26,910
adults.

441
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,743
It has to be judged differently.
The other issue that sort of fascinates 

442
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,870
me on a neuro biological level,
you know,

443
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,960
most of your cortex is doing just fine 
by the time you're three,

444
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,160
four,
five years old,

445
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,060
and there's the frontal cortex taking 
another 20 years to get there.

446
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,033
So you say,
so is the frontal cortex just a tougher 

447
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:50,790
construction project then the rest of 
the brain,

448
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,953
does it have like fancy type neurons you
don't see elsewhere that take amazing 

449
00:26:57,001 --> 00:27:00,240
wiring or like unique neuro 
transmitters?

450
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:03,030
Like what is it just like a tougher 
construction project?

451
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,930
Is that why you get the delay and you 
look closely and.

452
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,280
No,
it's not.

453
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,293
It's not implicitly a tougher project.
You don't get delayed from maturation 

454
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,004
because it's so hard to wire up.
You get the delay because we've been 

455
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:18,624
selected to have the delay.
You want a frontal cortex that spends a 

456
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:24,810
long,
long time and learning.

457
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,703
Okay.
How come?

458
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,030
Because by definition,
if this is the last part of the brain to

459
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:30,864
wire up,
it's the part of the brain that's most 

460
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:38,301
sculpted by experience and environment 
and least constrained by genes,

461
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,150
and this is the part of the brain that 
does social appropriate context learning

462
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,930
and that's incredibly tough stuff like 
every society,

463
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,820
every culture on earth.
Do you think about it?

464
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,833
Every culture on earth celebrates some 
types of murder and is horrified and 

465
00:27:56,671 --> 00:28:00,330
punishes other types.
Song get metals,

466
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,470
some get damnation,
some get like simply that one.

467
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,860
Every culture has some sort of 
strictures against lying.

468
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,813
Yet in some circumstances I expect you 
to have socially appropriate line in 

469
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:16,860
certain circumstances of protection or 
so on,

470
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,900
and every culture does this differently.
Every culture has culture specific mores

471
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,310
and situational ethics and things like 
and that's like fancy,

472
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:29,310
complicated stuff that takes a long time
to learn.

473
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,590
That's what you're doing is an 
adolescent.

474
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:32,424
As a young adult,
you're learning all the subtleties of 

475
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:37,230
appropriate behavior that's here from 
the cortex.

476
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:40,800
Learning not just how to get you to do 
the right thing,

477
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:41,634
that there is a harder thing to do,
but all of those complexities of what 

478
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,084
actually counts as the right thing and 
all of the things that make us human 

479
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,660
above all the other primates above all 
others because we're the species that in

480
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:56,424
some cultures can say,
we strongly believe in monogamy and 

481
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:01,614
build our theologies around that.
Yet at the same time have incredibly 

482
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,470
high rates of people failing to remain 
monogamous.

483
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,503
You have condemned that.
We have cultures where like you're not 

484
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:15,840
supposed to lie yet.
At some point you have to learn like,

485
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,980
okay,
it's okay to lie in a circumstance of so

486
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:22,890
tell us,
are you harboring those refugees in your

487
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:23,610
attic?

488
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,301
No,
no,

489
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:27,780
of course not.
Situational ethics like that.

490
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,643
It takes a very strong frontal cortex to
keep you for lying and certain tempting 

491
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,683
circumstances,
but once you've decided you're going to 

492
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:39,210
lie,
it takes it from a strong frontal cortex

493
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,044
to do it right,
to do it effectively because you got to 

494
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:46,690
regulate your voice and your facial 
expressions and where you're all his are

495
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,490
looking.
Whoa,

496
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:49,324
so this is a part of the brain that's 
got to incorporate your society's rules 

497
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,633
as to when it's okay to lie and in fact 
the sort of thing that we view as 

498
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,680
heroic,
but when it's not okay to lie,

499
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,610
but once you decide you're going to lie 
how to do it effectively.

500
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,983
This is like complicated neurobiology.
It can't just come with a genetic 

501
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:14,440
program of wires it up.
It's got to be totally sculpted body and

502
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,330
learning all those subtleties.
Wow,

503
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,393
and

504
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,800
is there another animal other than 
humans that does delay?

505
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:22,634
Reward?

506
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,250
Yeah,
I'm mean the dopamine system,

507
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:27,084
the reward system,
the interactions with the frontal 

508
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:30,810
cortex.
It's happening in a rodent.

509
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,080
Like rodents could learn to master,
okay,

510
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:36,870
if I press this lever once,
I get one reward,

511
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,003
but if I do to lever press,
if I work twice as hard to get three 

512
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,330
rewards,
Whoa,

513
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,520
that's the way to go.
It could master that,

514
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:45,354
monkeys can master that,
but it's just implicitly a different 

515
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:49,194
thing.
Like a monkey could do a delayed 

516
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:51,924
gratification task where it's got to 
wait a couple of minutes for the reward 

517
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,103
and it's the exact same neurobiology 
evolve as us doing delayed 

518
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:04,950
gratification,
except we do delayed gratification,

519
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:09,060
like you study hard to get a good sat 
score to get into a good college,

520
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:09,894
to get into a good Grad school,
to get a good job to get into the 

521
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:12,324
nursing home,
have your choice of delayed 

522
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:14,904
gratification.
That takes 60 years depending on your 

523
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:18,024
theology.
We do delayed gratification where the 

524
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:23,340
rewards not gonna come supposedly until 
the afterlife.

525
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,260
So like,
yeah,

526
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:29,280
a monkey can have it's frontal cortex,
do delayed gratification for it.

527
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,770
Wow.
On a scale of the minutes.

528
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,820
And we'd go and we'd like to do it for 
70 years.

529
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:38,490
It's,
we're just in a different league in that

530
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:39,310
regard.

531
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,180
Wow.
So,

532
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,014
uh,
essentially maybe even some religious 

533
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:45,390
rules are some ethical guidelines that 
we follow.

534
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,120
Could almost be like a scaffolding for 
the frontal quarter

535
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,033
techs to absolutely the rule of what 
counts as the right thing and what 

536
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:59,640
counts is the harder thing is very,
very culture specific.

537
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:04,560
And that's a tough neurobiological job 
to master.

538
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,543
Do we have any idea when this was do you
said this is the most recent thing 

539
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,870
developed and humans are the most 
recent.

540
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:11,100
We understand.
Well,

541
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:11,600
it's the,

542
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,790
it's the most recently evolved part of 
the brain,

543
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,820
which is to say like lizards or texts 
I'm not much to write home about,

544
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:25,541
but they've got like primitive cortex.
It's not who you get to mammals that you

545
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:30,520
start getting fancier cortex that does 
more abstract stuff and it's not true.

546
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,850
You get to mammals that you start seeing
the firsthand.

547
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,080
So frontal cortex.
So you know,

548
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,920
recently evolved the last 50 to 100 
years.

549
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,813
So in other words,
the frontal cortex is like spanking new 

550
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,653
and it's not until you get the primates 
that gave it a big frontal cortex and 

551
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:51,110
it's particularly large and apes and 
that proportionately,

552
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:54,350
it's particularly larger complexity 
wired in us.

553
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,733
No,
I know you spend a lot of time studying 

554
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:57,684
baboons.
And I listened to that Radiolab podcast 

555
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:01,390
that you did,
where this Bob Boone,

556
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,470
did you call it a troop baboon troop 
that,

557
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:05,304
uh,
was next to the place that was dumping 

558
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:07,944
human ways or human garbage and that 
these baboons became accustomed to 

559
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:13,194
eating this human garbage and the 
unprecedented change in their behavior 

560
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:22,460
when the male is the dominant males got 
sick from tuberculosis.

561
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,260
Yep.
Okay.

562
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:26,480
So as you said,
dive,

563
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,110
I've been studying baboons.
Are you study them by the way?

564
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:31,460
Like how does that work?
What do you do?

565
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,383
Oh,
it's been 33 summers I spent out there 

566
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,300
going back to a single every year.
Um,

567
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,340
it,
it ended about eight years ago,

568
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:41,174
but it had been essentially 33 street 
summers of like you go back to the same 

569
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:46,814
animals and you'd camp under the same 
tree and this isn't a national park in 

570
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:53,870
east Africa and you go back to the same 
animals.

571
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:54,704
And sort of the particular area I've 
focused my work on over the years is 

572
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:02,090
stress and health and what stress does 
to the brain and,

573
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,440
and with the baboons,
it was trying to make sense of what does

574
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:07,274
your social rank and your personality 
and your patterns of social affiliation 

575
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:16,100
have to do with which baboons have the 
cholesterol levels,

576
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:18,050
which baboons have the high blood 
pressure,

577
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,280
who's healthy,
who's not.

578
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,503
Um,
so these are animals where you go to 

579
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:27,440
your basic Jane Goodall scene of just 
like watching them endlessly and knowing

580
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,560
all about their personal lives.
And in addition,

581
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:35,561
I would dart anesthetize the baboons 
using a blowgun system which was totally

582
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,364
fun to do,
but anesthetize them and when they're 

583
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,870
down to basically the same clinical 
workup.

584
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,540
So you would do on a human sort of,
okay,

585
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,960
as these guys immune system working this
year,

586
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,700
how has it or you know,
just working that.

587
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:50,534
The last time I was out I had a portable
electric cardiogram machine for looking 

588
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:56,480
at cardiovascular,
cardiac function and these guys.

589
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,660
So you keep them there for a day,
you do various tests and then.

590
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,760
Yeah,
let him go back to their bodies and then

591
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:05,930
you have a sense of how is their bodily 
function,

592
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,290
their health or diseases.
They're stress physiology,

593
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,313
uh,
related to aspects of behavior for the 

594
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:14,990
first 10 years out there.

595
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,823
I thought when I had learned was if you 
want to be a healthy baboons with a 

596
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:21,494
minimal number of stress related 
diseases and you get a choice in the 

597
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:25,280
matter,
you want to be high ranking.

598
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,673
Um,
took me about 25 years and almost 

599
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:32,150
certainly that had to do with my having 
to grow up a little bit on my own,

600
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,453
uh,
to realize that there's much more 

601
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,570
interesting stuff going on.
If you got a choice between being a high

602
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:39,404
ranking by wound or a bad thing with a 
lot of staple affiliative relationships 

603
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,810
translated into English.
Friends,

604
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,600
friends are gonna be even better for 
your health.

605
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,090
I'm like,
that's even more protective.

606
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,630
How often do you sit and groom with 
somebody else?

607
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:58,380
How often you're sitting in contact?
How often are you playing with infants?

608
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,543
Turns out that's much more of a buffer 
for good health and simply what your 

609
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,170
dominance rank is.

610
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,943
So these baboons,
they started eating food from a resort 

611
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,923
and it changed their behavior to the 
point where they were no longer getting 

612
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,124
up very early in foraging.
They knew when the food was coming so 

613
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:18,184
they just wander down to this dump and 
then they would basically essentially 

614
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:23,440
fight over dominance of the dump and a 
few strong,

615
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:27,040
powerful males had control over that 
until they got sick.

616
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,881
Great.
Yep.

617
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,320
So this was the truth.

618
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,790
Next word of mine that had this tourist 
lodge and their territory and thus had a

619
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,960
garbage dump that like national parks 
everywhere have this issue with having a

620
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,760
control,
wild animals access to.

621
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,893
So this garbage dump troop that you said
to take him to basically just living in 

622
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:47,170
the trees above the dump.
Waddled down each morning,

623
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,004
just in time for the food,
junk leftovers from the lodge to be 

624
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:53,440
dumped there.
And you know,

625
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:57,300
I did a few studies on this troop.
They've got high cholesterol levels.

626
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,310
They got borderline diabetes.
They put on like subcutaneous fat.

627
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,780
They were exactly that tooth decay.
Yeah.

628
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:07,830
I

629
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,300
got different like parasites in their 
stomachs.

630
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,373
So they're,
they're just fine living off of the the 

631
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,360
good life they're like through now 
desserts,

632
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,710
this tourist lodge and in my troop a 
couple of kilometers away,

633
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,610
I don't know how this works,
but in some baboons way,

634
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,790
some of my males got word of this 
feasting going on up there,

635
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:35,100
like they smelled it on a note,
but it evolved that in the mornings,

636
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,093
about half the males from my troop would
pick up and run those couple of 

637
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,390
kilometers to go punch it out with the 
guys there to get access to some of this

638
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:47,470
garbage.
The key thing was that it wasn't random,

639
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,483
which of my baboons would go over there.
So you're a guy from like an outside 

640
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:53,464
troop and you show up at this garbage 
dump and there was 80 baboons like 

641
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:57,880
feasting there.
And you're an outsider.

642
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,180
No one from my troop would my dream of 
going near the garbage unless he's a big

643
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,360
aggressive guy.

644
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,093
The other thing is morning is when 
baboons do most of their socializing 

645
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:10,264
stuff.
They sit around and they groom and they 

646
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:14,230
gossip before they go out and they do 
two days foraging.

647
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:18,970
So if you're willing to pick up and 
instead spend each morning fighting with

648
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:19,804
strangers over garbage,
that means you're not very socially 

649
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:24,460
affiliated.
So in other words,

650
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,443
the males from my troops who were going 
to eat the garbage were the most 

651
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:31,180
aggressive least socially affiliated 
guys.

652
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,553
So this is going on for a couple of 
years and then your turns to be a 

653
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:36,394
tuberculosis outbreak among the baboons 
over there because there was tubercular 

654
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,334
meat and in the law and Shannon,
a meat inspector who's being bribed and 

655
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,500
all sorts of par find things and you 
know,

656
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:54,730
a human gets tuberculosis and they can 
sit around and write thousand page novel

657
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:57,700
some out for the next 10 years while 
they slowly waste away.

658
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,540
TB kills other primates like over the 
course of weeks.

659
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,374
It's like wildfire in nonhuman primates.
So there's an outbreak of TB from the 

660
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:07,534
infected meat in this lodge dump.
And it basically kills all the baboons 

661
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,283
and that troop and it kills all of my 
baboons who had been going over there 

662
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:16,834
every morning for food.
So now what you have is half the number 

663
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:22,174
of males as usual.
So you got a two to one female to male 

664
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,480
ratio,
which is pretty atypical for a bag troop

665
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,930
and the key thing is the baboons who are
left are the nice guys.

666
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,290
They're socially affiliated,
they're the least aggressive.

667
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,410
What's by aggression about you're having
a bad day,

668
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:41,170
you find somebody smaller and weaker to 
take it out on.

669
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:45,850
They weren't dumping on weaker animals,
they weren't having displaced aggression

670
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,590
and it turned into just to be technical 
here,

671
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,570
like a much nicer troop.

672
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,660
They were at much higher rates of 
grooming,

673
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,970
less aggression,
more sitting in contact.

674
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,983
Male baboons would groom each other,
which you don't see male baboons 

675
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,490
grooming each other in this troop.
They would.

676
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,710
So in and of itself,
that's totally fascinating.

677
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:06,544
So okay,
you get rid of 50 percent of the males 

678
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:12,310
who the jerks and you have a commune 
that are going on.

679
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,923
What was most interesting,
the thing that just flattened me was 10 

680
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,560
years later,
the troop is still like that.

681
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,413
Ten years later,
all the males who were there during the 

682
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:26,014
TB outbreak,
who survived it and ushered in sort of 

683
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,390
the commune there.
They're long gone.

684
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,730
So who the new males,
male baboons,

685
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:35,564
pick up the puberty,
they leave their home troop and they go 

686
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:39,574
wandering and joined some adult trip 
somewhere else and spend the rest of 

687
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,230
their life.
They're heading up the hierarchy.

688
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,720
In other words,
by 10 years later,

689
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,793
all the males in this troop who were 
still being less aggressive and more 

690
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:52,204
socially affiliated,
they had all grown up someplace else in 

691
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:56,254
some other true and transferred as 
adolescents into this true and somehow 

692
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:03,970
or other learned even though they grew 
up in the normal,

693
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:05,920
big,
bad world out there,

694
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,820
somehow they learned,
we don't do crap like that here.

695
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,950
Cut it out.
Wow.

696
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,700
And I did a ton of work,
sort of seen what that was about.

697
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:21,060
And it takes about six months.
Once these new males show up for them,

698
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,033
they're less subject to resident males 
dumping on them because there's less of 

699
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:27,604
this displacement aggression.
Females who were getting dumped on less 

700
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:31,204
by males and thus are much more relaxed,
lower stress hormone levels are more 

701
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,253
willing to be affiliated with them.
You some new adolescent male and you 

702
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,720
show up in your typical baboons.
True.

703
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,810
And it's like 80 days on the average 
before some female to you in this troop,

704
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,743
it was like three days every because 
everybody is much more relaxed because 

705
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:52,604
no one's being miserable to each other 
and it turns out you take a jerky 

706
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:59,360
adolescent male,
because these guys were just as Jerky is

707
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:00,194
any transfer males were to any of the 
neighboring troops and like you treat 

708
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:04,754
them nicer and they kind of calmed down 
over the next six months and literally 

709
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:10,364
what you had,
what social anthropologists would be 

710
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:17,531
forced to define as cultural 
transmission non-genetic transmission of

711
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:22,010
a style of behavior from one generation 
to the next.

712
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,083
This was culture being transmitted,
a culture of high affiliation and less 

713
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:27,884
aggression.

714
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,580
And these baboons are essentially living
a natural life.

715
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,370
They're not getting food from people.
Yep.

716
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,413
They're just living

717
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,860
out in the Serengeti in east Africa and 
just go about normal life.

718
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,333
For me,
what was most striking about this is 

719
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,693
like baboons are as high rates of 
aggression as you find in any nonhuman 

720
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,340
primates,
a male dominance,

721
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:56,360
highly hierarchical structured societies
since the early sixties.

722
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:57,194
They have not just metaphorically,
but they've literally been the textbook 

723
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,583
example of primates evolved for 
aggression than male dominance and 

724
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,263
hierarchy and stratification and all it 
took was one generation of a radically 

725
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,553
unique circumstance.
And you see a pattern of begging 

726
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,540
behavior that had never been seen 
before.

727
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,880
So in a sense,
what we see in human beings,

728
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:25,740
we see big differences in cultures in 
the way people are treated,

729
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:27,780
the way women are treated,
the way we,

730
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:29,490
they cohabitate with each other,
the way,

731
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,393
uh,
just whatever the community that they 

732
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:33,714
live in,
there's differences in the way we 

733
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:37,140
behave.
But with most primates,

734
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,530
would you essentially say like,
most chimpanzees are most Benobos,

735
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,350
that you can kind of uniformly say 
Benobos,

736
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:44,580
behave this way.
Chimpanzees,

737
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:45,414
behave this way.
Is this the only time you've ever seen 

738
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,690
like a complete variation of the 
standard behavior of a primate?

739
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,370
Um,
as far as I know,

740
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:54,204
this is the only example of something 
like this that's been seen but other 

741
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,780
ecological extremes and you get some 
radical shifts.

742
00:44:03,781 --> 00:44:04,614
But in lots of ways,
this is the biggest cultural shift that 

743
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,040
anyone has seen.
And sort of the social model,

744
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,750
you have a bathroom trip.
Um,

745
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,783
and for me,
what the biggest take home message of 

746
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:20,010
that is exactly what you just honed in 
on who these guys are,

747
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:24,090
textbook examples of the inevitability 
of stratification and aggression and all

748
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,253
and know it turns out it's not 
inevitable that can suddenly flip with 

749
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:33,120
some like unique circumstances,
be transmitted multi-generationally.

750
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,403
Anyone who could look at humans and say 
that there are certain inevitabilities 

751
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,160
to some of the most unpalatable things 
we do.

752
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,233
They don't have a leg to stand on if at 
Boone's have the behavioral sort of 

753
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:50,691
flexibility and plasticity built into 
them just lurking for a unique situation

754
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:51,894
like this and suddenly six months of a 
different cultural style and you adopt 

755
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:57,554
it and pass it on a can.
You don't have a leg to stand on to say 

756
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:02,274
that certain of the worst things about 
human culture and behavior is 

757
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,574
inevitable.

758
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,910
No.
What we vary so wildly from continent to

759
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:12,040
continent that we've kind of gotten used
to it,

760
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:12,874
but to see it in,
in another kind of primate and to see 

761
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:19,510
that circumstances can change the way 
they behave.

762
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,463
And,
and literally change their entire 

763
00:45:21,671 --> 00:45:22,504
community to the point where decades 
later and it's like 20 years later 

764
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:26,260
they're still the same.
Right?

765
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:27,460
Is that the case?
They,

766
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,660
the culture there went for about 20 
years and is it,

767
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,643
does it dissolve now?
Did it involve back to normal baboons 

768
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,500
behavior?

769
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,333
Originally,
it basically ended when the troops sort 

770
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:41,704
of moved into the vacuum created by the 
TB outbreak and moved into the lodge 

771
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:49,490
area and they kind of disintegrated as a
true.

772
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:53,950
A lot of them got habituated enough to 
the humans there to represent the danger

773
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,380
game park rangers had to kill about half
of them,

774
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,430
so the troop basically does not exist 
anymore,

775
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,360
but for about 20 years.
That's crazy.

776
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,400
Well,
does that give you hope when it comes to

777
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:06,234
human beings because it seems like it's 
such a radical shift or the behavior of 

778
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:14,820
a primate without a language that to to 
see that that's possible,

779
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:19,590
that just a shift of circumstance can 
change the entire behavior pattern.

780
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:19,780
Yeah.

781
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,740
His troop.
Yep.

782
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,360
I mean sort of the,
the,

783
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:27,010
the take home messages to,
to usher in rural piece with humans just

784
00:46:27,011 --> 00:46:27,844
like go give tb to males,
but I guess that's not the sort of most 

785
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:37,591
obvious take home message,
but I mean you look at humans change.

786
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:38,764
Human cultures change the 17th century,
like the most terrifying people in 

787
00:46:42,641 --> 00:46:43,474
Europe or the Swedes.
They spent the whole century rampaging 

788
00:46:45,731 --> 00:46:49,600
through Europe and they've now gone more
than 200 years since they've had a war.

789
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,050
World War One,
Christmas trees in 1914.

790
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:53,884
All it took was about four hours of 
British and German troops fraternizing 

791
00:46:57,701 --> 00:46:58,534
from across the lines while they were 
supposedly doing nothing more than 

792
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,673
retrieving dead bodies from no man's 
land between the trenches and before it 

793
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:07,264
was over with.
They were praying together and having 

794
00:47:08,981 --> 00:47:12,730
Christmas dinner together and playing 
soccer together and exchanging addresses

795
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:13,564
to meet after the war and were they held
out for days at some of those points 

796
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,634
until officers had to show up and 
threatened to shoot these guys unless 

797
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,960
they went back to trying to kill each 
other.

798
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:24,843
Change can occur very dramatically.
I mean these days there's an entire 

799
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,680
agencies that devote a are devoted to 
Vietnam veterans going to Vietnam,

800
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:41,950
going back for reconciliation ceremonies
are going back to,

801
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,900
you know,
foundations that literally build bridges

802
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:49,750
across the rivers,
helping schools,

803
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:54,610
all of the what of that could have been 
conceived of like 1970.

804
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,893
Yeah.
Humans have an astonishing capacity to 

805
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,624
change.

806
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,733
It's just,
it's so fascinating when you consider 

807
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:06,310
all of the variables that cause a person
to be who they are,

808
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:07,144
to behave who they are and then them 
interacting with all these other people 

809
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:11,044
who share variables and have unique 
variables and that there's just so many 

810
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:18,760
different factors in what makes a 
community a city,

811
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:19,594
a country.
It's pretty mindboggling would consider 

812
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,760
all the variables.
It's utterly

813
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,913
boggling.
And just to really get sort of 

814
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,050
provocative or at this point,
um,

815
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,053
what one does with all that complexity 
and with all the biology we haven't 

816
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:38,364
discovered yet,
and all those gaping sort of holes of 

817
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:43,560
explanation as to where that behavior 
comes from.

818
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,790
This thing we call a freewill.
Yeah.

819
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,450
All free will is the biology we haven't 
discovered yet.

820
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:53,903
Yeah.
Sam Harris broke my brain talking about 

821
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:56,874
threewill once where I really believed 
it was real until he started explaining 

822
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:02,520
to me determinism and all the different 
variables and yeah,

823
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:03,354
I mean do you do.
There is a little bit of something that 

824
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:07,980
we have where you're talking about the 
frontal cortex that allows you to resist

825
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:10,670
things,
but like why is yours the way it is?

826
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,370
Question,

827
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,203
right?
Yeah,

828
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:17,210
and if get some of it had to do with how
stressed or mothered was when you were a

829
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:23,100
fetus,
like how are okay,

830
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:28,101
like here's a just on the level of sort 
of sensory stuff going on.

831
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:33,840
Just the sensory cues we're getting into
the world and how that's influencing our

832
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:34,674
behavior.
Put up a pair of all his upholstered 

833
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,273
with just showing a pair of eyes on a 
bus stop and people litter less display 

834
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:44,394
a pair of eyes on a computer screen and 
people become more generous and online 

835
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,570
economic games because it's tapping 
into.

836
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:52,923
I'm being watched.
Stick somebody in a room with smelly 

837
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:59,490
garbage and they become more socially 
conservative on questionnaires.

838
00:49:59,491 --> 00:50:00,324
They're filling out because something 
just feels this really disgusting and 

839
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:06,144
that biases us towards deciding that 
something that's different is different 

840
00:50:09,811 --> 00:50:10,644
than wrong.
People don't become more conservative 

841
00:50:12,571 --> 00:50:15,300
about economic issues or geopolitical 
stuff.

842
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,373
They're just more likely to decide that 
them's who do something different from 

843
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,480
you.
It's not just different,

844
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:22,314
it's wrong because something just feels 
kind of disgusting because they're 

845
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:27,284
smelly in a room.
One very influential study looking at 

846
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:31,184
5,000 judicial decisions over the course
of a year and a parole board system and 

847
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,823
the single biggest predictor of what 
decision a judge who was going to make 

848
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:40,634
if they gave somebody parole or sent 
them back to the slammer was how many 

849
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,880
hours it had been since the judge had 
eaten a meal.

850
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,430
Because when you got hired glucose 
levels in your bloodstream,

851
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,473
your frontal cortex works better because
it's a real expensive part of the brain 

852
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,660
and when you're hungry,
you feel less sympathy.

853
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,930
You feel less empathy.
People become less generous and economic

854
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:03,764
games and how much would you contribute 
to this and what sort of a judge has to 

855
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:08,660
do.

856
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,493
They're in a situation.
Anytime we judge is do this difficult 

857
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,103
frontal task of trying to view the world
from somebody else's perspective and 

858
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,600
they're hyperglycemic,
you haven't eaten in four hours and it's

859
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:23,240
more likely that your frontal cortex in 
effect is going to say,

860
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:24,890
screw that,
that's too hard.

861
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,990
The guy's wrong,
and send them back to jail.

862
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:28,403
What's most amazing is if you had gotten
one of those judges two seconds after 

863
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:32,414
they made that decision that could most 
be predicted by the effects of glucose 

864
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:40,550
on the brain metabolism and asked them,
so why do you make that decision?

865
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:41,384
And they're going to be quoting like 
enlightenment age philosophers or 

866
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:45,734
something.
And that's just like rationalization 

867
00:51:48,741 --> 00:51:49,574
running to catch up with the biology 
that's just rumbling underneath the 

868
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,970
surface there and influencing our 
behaviors.

869
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,013
Wow.
So like maybe one of the best ways we 

870
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:04,490
can enhance society is keep people well 
fed and lower stress.

871
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,630
Yeah.
Um,

872
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:08,503
if nothing else,
like what people have known for decades 

873
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:15,140
when we're stressed or like learning and
memory doesn't work that well,

874
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,663
then people learned were more likely to 
be anxious and learn to be afraid of 

875
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:20,894
things we don't need to be afraid of,
and then we learned were more likely to 

876
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:24,794
have horrible judgment than have her 
frontal cortex not work very well and 

877
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,890
the newest realm of that is,
and when you're stressed,

878
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:31,783
you're less empathic because it takes a 
lot of work to try to view the world 

879
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:38,204
from somebody else's perspective and 
worry about their worries instead of 

880
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:41,990
your own problems.

881
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,580
And if you're in a defensive or worried 
position that you're most likely to lash

882
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,414
out,
you're most likely to protect yourself 

883
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:49,480
quickly.
Yep.

884
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:50,383
And quite literally a part of the brain 
that's involved in empathy doesn't work 

885
00:52:54,081 --> 00:52:56,390
as well.
When stress hormone levels are elevated.

886
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:57,643
Now what about the frontal cortex and an
actual damage like damaged from car 

887
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,970
accidents or head trauma?

888
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,980
One incredibly interesting,
contentious area.

889
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,220
You massively damaged somebody's frontal
cortex and they will know the difference

890
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:19,530
between right and wrong.
Yet,

891
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:20,364
they still cannot regulate their 
behavior on the most fundamental level 

892
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:29,490
famous neurological patients in the 1840
[inaudible] phineas gage,

893
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,553
a,
he had part of his frontal cortex 

894
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:32,484
destroyed in a.
He was a foreman of a railroad 

895
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:37,350
construction line who have problems with
some dynamite.

896
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,280
Somebody did something wrong,
the 13 foot metal raw shot of one of his

897
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:45,630
eyes and at the top of his head and took
his frontal cortex with landing about 50

898
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:50,631
feet away and gage who was the sobriety.
This devout reliable,

899
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:52,044
he was the foreman there turns into this
dis-inhibited crass sexually abusive 

900
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:58,494
bully afterward who never was able to 
hold a job again for years afterward 

901
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:02,904
because you would take an outage,
frontal cortex and you damage the 

902
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:11,511
frontal cortex and you get dysregulation
of volitional behavior,

903
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:12,684
which is once again we have saying 
people know what the optimal behavior 

904
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,240
is,
the difference between right and wrong,

905
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,760
and yet they can't regulate their 
behavior.

906
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,150
Something like,
depending on which study you look at,

907
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,073
something like 25 to 50 percent of the 
men on death row in this country have a 

908
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:33,300
history of concussion head trauma to the
front of their heads,

909
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,173
and that's a world of like volitional 
control is not that volitional because 

910
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,100
that seems to go contrary to the idea of
a lobotomy then.

911
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,140
Okay.
Luvata bottomy was just.

912
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,033
That's great that the law bottom,
he was just like savaging about the 

913
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:53,874
front.
Third of the brain is giving you the 

914
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:57,720
front photo is also getting limbic 
emotional.

915
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,620
What did they do when they did the 
potteries?

916
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,310
Well,
by the time it really got developed,

917
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:05,670
the guy like one of science's amazing 
irony is that guy,

918
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:10,600
a Portuguese neurologist named a cosmo 
knees who developed Lucado.

919
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:11,434
Amy's is what they were originally 
called about the Nobel prize in 

920
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:16,080
physiology and medicine for this 
wonderful technique,

921
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:21,390
and then when it hit America as a sort 
of psychiatric intervention,

922
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:22,224
good American knowhow and can do spirit,
decided to get a sort of assembly line 

923
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:27,264
approach to it.

924
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:31,230
Finding Walter Freeman pioneered sort of
rapid,

925
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,193
like wham Bam,
frontal lobotomies where you would 

926
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:36,384
insert in the high pick through some an 
ice pick rather behind somebody's 

927
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:41,483
eyeball,
go up through the optical cavity there 

928
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,860
and go in there and just screw around 
and there,

929
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:47,694
you know,
I mean he had like instructional films 

930
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:53,220
in the fifties for having,
you could do a frontal lobotomy and like

931
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,173
one person every 10 minutes and just 
like go through an entire hospitals 

932
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:58,344
where the psychiatric patients in one 
like devoted afternoon of calvinist 

933
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:03,930
ethic,
hard work.

934
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,630
So they were just scrambling it and they
were scrambling.

935
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:10,500
So the neurobiology of like what you 
were disconnecting there was,

936
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,780
it was like virtually random other than 
you were just making a mess in the front

937
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:19,620
part of the brain.
So frontal damage instead is a much more

938
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:20,454
selective issue.
Do you shutter when you think about the 

939
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:24,070
fact that that was just not even 100 
years ago?

940
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,470
Yeah.
Um,

941
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,060
you know,
Code Code Code on medical school library

942
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:31,894
and go keep floors down to the sub sub 
basement and like go read some of these 

943
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:40,830
journals from like 19 or whatever.
And like,

944
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,030
yeah,
you shutter her,

945
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,310
my God,
the things they didn't know them,

946
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,340
my God,
the damage they could have done.

947
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:51,760
Then the damages to the causes of 
disease,

948
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:55,270
the causes of psychiatric disorders.
My God,

949
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:56,104
some of the things they were doing that 
and if you've got a shred of capacity 

950
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:03,640
for self reflection,
you then have to sit there and say,

951
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,773
well,
a hundred years from now they're going 

952
00:57:05,691 --> 00:57:06,524
to be looking at our level of knowledge 
and they'll be saying the same exact 

953
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:10,810
thing.

954
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,090
What do you think would be the Big One?
What do you think it would be?

955
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:13,924
Antidepressants.
Do you think it would be painkillers 

956
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,533
that they're handing out?
What do you think we'd be the big one 

957
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:19,150
that people be freaking out about today?

958
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,970
I think about what we think what we're 
doing now.

959
00:57:22,971 --> 00:57:25,980
That's.
I think it's overwhelmingly good at b,

960
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,910
my God,
that that quaint,

961
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:29,883
medieval destructive belief they held 
onto them about human agency and 

962
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:37,460
freewill.
Whoa.

963
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:42,730
They punished people who had brains that
couldn't regulate their own behavior.

964
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,203
They punished people who because of 
toxin exposure or stress during 

965
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:48,584
adolescence,
wound up with brains that couldn't 

966
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:51,134
control this or that a particular 
junctures and they used words like 

967
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:56,360
justice back then.
Wow,

968
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:57,194
I can't believe the stuff they did.
It was practically like gangs and Gordy 

969
00:58:02,091 --> 00:58:02,924
risk,
peasants getting burning torches and 

970
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:05,294
going and burning down into whatever's 
around the medieval castle in terms of 

971
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:09,584
senses of the word justice,
applying to what biology has to do with 

972
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:14,714
behavior.

973
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,980
There's so few people that share this 
idea that you're having.

974
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:18,814
I mean obviously your sense of it is so 
much more educated than the average 

975
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:22,354
person and you understand all the 
mechanisms behind all of these 

976
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:26,163
particular behavioral problems that 
people have and all these different 

977
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,510
things can affect the way human beings 
operate,

978
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:36,511
but most people are not aware of this.
I mean literally most people like if you

979
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:37,180
had to guess,
if it's.

980
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,013
It might be in the 90 percent of people 
haven't really considered all the 

981
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:42,334
factors that lead to someone having a 
brain that would put them in these 

982
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:50,050
impulsive decision,
terrible decision making situations.

983
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:56,330
That's what gives me a little bit of 
sort of optimism is most people though,

984
00:58:56,371 --> 00:58:57,204
at least in the West,
have done that in a couple of realms 

985
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,853
like 500 years ago,
if you had an epileptic seizure for 

986
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:07,830
smartest,
most reflective,

987
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:11,230
most compassionate,
like middle ages,

988
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,533
bleeding heart liberals even would have 
had an explanation for what caused an 

989
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:16,554
epileptic seizure,
which is you were demonically possessed 

990
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,223
and the therapeutic intervention done 
Bernie with the and now instead we're 

991
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,593
know a century or two into having a 
mindset where instead we make a 

992
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:30,710
biological statement,
Oh,

993
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,930
it's not him,
it's his disease.

994
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,123
Oh,
he's not demonically possessed these 

995
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:36,104
cuts.
Something screwy with this potassium 

996
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:38,054
channels in the brain unless he gets 
synchronized outburst and every now and 

997
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:45,260
then he has a seizure disorder.
Like it's taken us about 500 years to do

998
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:48,550
that one to go from.
This is a,

999
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,660
a blast room.

1000
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,220
This behavior where we know the 
intervention,

1001
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,590
which is to burn somebody at the state 
the same,

1002
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,600
oh,
it's a biological problem.

1003
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,360
And we even recognize constraints with 
that.

1004
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:02,570
If somebody has uncontrolled epilepsy 
that's treatment resistant,

1005
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,793
um,
they may not be able to get a driver's 

1006
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:08,450
license,
but you don't sit there and say,

1007
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:09,284
yeah,
let's have a burning of the driver's 

1008
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:13,970
licenses and the epileptics it's about 
damn time they got.

1009
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:15,500
But they were.
No,

1010
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:20,501
it's a realm where words like evil or 
soul or punishment or justice,

1011
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,250
it's totally irrelevant.
Oh,

1012
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,030
it's a neurological disorder.
So it's only taken us about 500 years to

1013
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:29,150
get to that point.
So maybe you know,

1014
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:32,420
we've done that cognitive leap at least 
once.

1015
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,710
There's no victims there though.
There's no yet.

1016
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,593
Well,
I don't know,

1017
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,400
but most of the time obviously if 
someone's behind the wheel and they have

1018
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:42,050
a seizure,
then someone dies.

1019
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:42,943
Yeah.
But we don't think of it as someone 

1020
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:45,320
doing something.
We think of it there,

1021
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:47,240
they lose.
They lost control of their body,

1022
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:50,450
like literally piloting a car,
unfortunately.

1023
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:53,120
And that's what happens if I ever versus
someone committing a crime

1024
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,053
500 years ago.
If an epileptic during a seizure where 

1025
01:00:56,821 --> 01:01:00,660
their linens flailing struck someone 
that would have been assault and battery

1026
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,470
because told them to go like sleep with 
Satan,

1027
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,830
that's damn fault and it's like it's 
ridiculous mindset.

1028
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,673
Now there's large parts of the 
developing world that still has exactly 

1029
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:15,090
that view of epilepsy,
but at least in the west,

1030
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,020
like that's an unrecognizably different 
mindset.

1031
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,220
No,
no,

1032
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:22,620
that was not.
They didn't choose to do that.

1033
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:25,320
That was something screwy with their 
biology.

1034
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:28,320
Like we've gotten to that so I don't 
know,

1035
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,273
maybe another 500 years and we're going 
to be able to do that with maybe half 

1036
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:34,644
the jury's in this country are capable 
of doing the same thing of saying it's 

1037
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:39,810
not him,
it's his disease.

1038
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,853
When you have somebody with paranoid 
schizophrenia who in a delusional state 

1039
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,140
that something violent maybe,
I don't know,

1040
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:49,860
half of teachers in the country are able
to incorporate.

1041
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,660
No,
this kid isn't lazy.

1042
01:01:51,661 --> 01:01:53,670
That's not why they're not learning to 
read.

1043
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,773
They have this thing called dyslexia,
meaning there's abnormalities micro or 

1044
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,870
macro maladies in their cortex and the 
part having to do.

1045
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,220
It's not them.
It's like,

1046
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:06,150
so we're making a little bit of 
progress.

1047
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:07,950
You see,
you seem optimistic,

1048
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,920
optimistic,
and 500 year time span.

1049
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,480
We think it's kind of playing out in the
right direction.

1050
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,373
Just very slowly.
Like when you see these like political 

1051
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:21,750
debates,
people on television talking about crime

1052
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:22,584
and punishment and,
and none of these factors being 

1053
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:27,570
discussed is incredibly frustrated.
It's incredible,

1054
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:32,590
really frustrating.
And they will look back at us and say,

1055
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,213
my God,
the things they thought then the damage 

1056
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:41,110
they did then and all we can do at this 
point,

1057
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:41,944
given that we'll know a whole lot of the
biology and look at most of this stuff 

1058
01:02:47,051 --> 01:02:51,610
that we've learned about the frontal 
cortex or oxytocin or jeans.

1059
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,790
And we've learned all of that in the 
last 50 years,

1060
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:57,250
in the last 20 years,
in the last five years.

1061
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:01,390
Like you look at the distribution when 
these papers were published,

1062
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,100
um,
you know,

1063
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,143
all we could do in the meantime is have 
a hell of a lot of humility before we 

1064
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:12,550
think we understand what the causes of 
the behavior,

1065
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:13,653
especially behavior that we judge 
harshly because the odds are we haven't 

1066
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,380
a clue what the actual biology is at,
what's going on there.

1067
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:25,560
And we fill in those attributional 
yawning vacuums with this invention that

1068
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:30,140
we call volition and free will,
has anything

1069
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:35,180
on every use toxo for an excuse or for 
defense,

1070
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,144
for crime.
I don't because there was that in case 

1071
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:42,840
you remember twinkie case Dan white 
blood sugar level,

1072
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:43,683
both that's been used of severe Perry 
Menstrual Syndrome has been used 

1073
01:03:49,481 --> 01:03:50,314
successfully in courts of law to 
mitigate sentencing of women who 

1074
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:54,770
committed violent crimes,
uh,

1075
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,750
around the time of their period having 
certain variants on jeans.

1076
01:03:58,751 --> 01:03:59,584
This one gene,
which unfortunately this variant is 

1077
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:02,560
government,
the horrible term.

1078
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:03,603
The warrior gene has been used 
successful in a couple of courts of law 

1079
01:04:06,611 --> 01:04:09,130
to mitigate sentence saying what?
How are they?

1080
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,290
Have they used that?
It's this,

1081
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:14,230
it's this.
It's a gene called Mao.

1082
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:16,870
Alpha model,
amine oxidase Alpha,

1083
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:18,223
it's got something to do with 
neurochemistry and something to do with 

1084
01:04:20,681 --> 01:04:21,514
the neurochemistry of aggression.
The gene comes in a couple of different 

1085
01:04:25,871 --> 01:04:30,871
versions and one particular variant is 
associated with high rates of antisocial

1086
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:32,884
aggression in humans.
If and only if the human was abused 

1087
01:04:37,391 --> 01:04:40,000
during childhood.
In other words,

1088
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:43,030
that gene is determining absolutely 
zero.

1089
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,250
You're getting a gene environment 
interaction.

1090
01:04:45,251 --> 01:04:49,360
The absence of an abusive childhood.
Having this gene variant has zero impact

1091
01:04:49,361 --> 01:04:52,660
on this behavior.
So like ridiculous.

1092
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:56,890
Lee Simplified pseudoscientific 
interpretations.

1093
01:04:56,891 --> 01:05:00,520
Findings like these have sort of led you
into courts of law saying,

1094
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,413
Oh wow,
has that genetic variant that's 

1095
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:03,910
inevitable.

1096
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:06,370
So is this similar in a way to,
um,

1097
01:05:06,371 --> 01:05:07,204
I believe it was India.
They used Mri to determine someone's 

1098
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:13,150
knowledge of a murder and they convicted
the woman that made her guilty of it.

1099
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,180
Yup.
Yup.

1100
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,263
No lie.
Mri is the name of the company in the 

1101
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:18,993
United States that purports to have the 
technology well enough that they can 

1102
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:21,840
tell if you're lying or not,

1103
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,990
but it's all.
But from what I understand,

1104
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:26,750
it was just functional knowledge of the 
crime yet,

1105
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:31,510
which could have been imparted in 
defending or trying to put together,

1106
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,480
just because you're obviously have a lot
invested in this crime because you might

1107
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:37,100
go to jail for the rest of your life for
it.

1108
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:41,160
Yep.
Basically there's no science for that.

1109
01:05:41,161 --> 01:05:42,630
The science is not there yet.

1110
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,670
So it would never work in America that,
that case or should not,

1111
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,530
I should say ship not and should not 
work in India.

1112
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:50,570
India was going,
yeah.

1113
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,590
Yeah.
That,

1114
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:54,150
that's the case.
So what have they done with this warrior

1115
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:55,700
gene?
How has someone been exonerated?

1116
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:57,560
Oh,
where was it?

1117
01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:00,590
I think it wasn't a court in Italy.
Um,

1118
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,653
we're just sentencing was decreased 
because the defense made an argument 

1119
01:06:04,401 --> 01:06:07,850
afterwards saying,
well genetically predisposed.

1120
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:10,220
So like that's

1121
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,723
isn't Italy the place where they charged
scientists with not being able to 

1122
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:18,694
register when an earthquake earthquake 
by assuring the public there wasn't an 

1123
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,880
earthquake.
Literally tried them for that.

1124
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:24,883
I think that's my people.
I think the dust is still settling from 

1125
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:33,514
that one.
I think most of those convictions have 

1126
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,570
been overturned.
But but terrifying that those people had

1127
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:40,240
to go to court.
You imagine if you're a seismologist and

1128
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:41,110
you have to go,
hey,

1129
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,380
this is not how it works.
You asked Jesus Christ,

1130
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:45,214
I can't tell you when it's coming.
You don't think I would be out of the 

1131
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,690
country also.
The fuck is wrong with you.

1132
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,340
Oh No.
My son,

1133
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:54,730
the scientist is like being convicted of
murder.

1134
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,713
So it's essentially in these less 
informed areas where these things have 

1135
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:00,280
passed,
like the Fmr,

1136
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:03,400
I think in India and this in Italy,
the warrior gene thing.

1137
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:04,870
Well what?
But it's dangerous,

1138
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:05,550
right?
Yeah.

1139
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:10,550
I mean you see like be careful what you 
wish for in terms of creative people.

1140
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:14,340
Learn more about science,
more to sign.

1141
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,510
I'm like,
great.

1142
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,450
Yeah.
It's a little bit mighty scary.

1143
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,620
Let's see.
I'm just knowing.

1144
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:24,130
I need to know it's 6:15 or should we 
wrap it up?

1145
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,810
Thank you so much.
Really,

1146
01:07:25,811 --> 01:07:27,130
really appreciate.
It was a pleasure.

1147
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,490
I've been a fan of yours for years.
This is a real treat for me.

1148
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:32,110
I was looking forward to it.
Alright everybody,

1149
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,330
this is a short one but an awesome on.
Thank you.
