1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,270
Happy Canadian thanksgiving by the way.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:03,810
Thank you.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:03,910
Oh,

5
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,280
powerful Canadian thanksgiving.

6
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,250
It is a very powerful and uh,

7
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,730
interchangeable Columbus Day of it.

8
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,860
Only because sometimes this is the
12 sometimes it's a real change.

9
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,300
Oh,

10
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,920
so today is or isn't it?

11
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,191
Is,

12
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:14,900
it is.

13
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,080
You know how this one's fluid,

14
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:17,070
like President Day,

15
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,341
you know,

16
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,720
kids don't get that off school anymore.

17
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,380
No,

18
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,130
not funny.

19
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,330
When we were talking about it today,

20
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:21,961
like yeah,

21
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,940
cause they realize Columbus
was kind of a mass murderer.

22
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,230
No holidays changed more in ethos
from the time we were a little to now.

23
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,350
Well like Santa Claus didn't become a
fucking housebreaking sexual violator.

24
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,201
Yeah,

25
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:34,730
you're right.

26
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,300
At first it was Columbus
discovered America with the
Santa Maria and the Pinto,

27
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,134
Anna Nina.

28
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,400
And then it was,

29
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:41,581
oh,

30
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:42,990
he never really got to America.

31
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,610
He was in The Bahamas or some shit.

32
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,580
And then it got to,

33
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,580
he's a murderer and just dashing babies'
heads on rocks and stories of the year.

34
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,170
And they would force people to get,

35
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,630
bring them back gold and they would have
to bring like whatever they weighed and

36
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,540
gold every week.

37
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,101
And if they didn't,

38
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,450
they'd cut one of their arms off.

39
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:00,840
Oh yeah.

40
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,280
So they do it to a couple people.

41
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,140
They cut their arm off
and everyone's screaming.

42
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,770
And so the rest of them just
scramble and go and get that gold.

43
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,651
Like they,

44
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,484
they there.

45
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,760
Do you remember the last time I was on,

46
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,620
we talked about Columbus cause you
called him an original gangster.

47
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,700
He really was.

48
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,640
Well I think everybody
was gangster back then.

49
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,440
Crown couldn't wait.

50
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,230
It was when he got back
after the first one.

51
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,580
It took a long time.

52
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,020
The other guy who hated him,

53
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,640
who was also co captain of the expedition
died for much to his good fortune.

54
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:30,510
He was in another boat,

55
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,480
isn't the Nina and uh,

56
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,300
so Columbus got back after much ado.

57
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,461
Yeah.

58
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,590
Did you go to Portugal?

59
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:37,171
He almost crashed.

60
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,430
Landed the whole fucking enchilada.

61
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,070
When he finally got to
Ferdinand and Isabella,

62
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,460
he had enough stuff with
him from that first journey.

63
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,061
And by the way,

64
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:48,630
he left like 40 guys there because the
Santa Maria ran aground and there was

65
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,500
fucking scuppered.

66
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,770
So he just left a bunch of
fucking guys in the Caribbean.

67
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,340
And they died.

68
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,640
They got in fights with the Indians
and died when he got back to Spain and

69
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,031
finally,

70
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,010
finally got to front in
front of the king and Queen.

71
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,740
He had a cut,

72
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,440
you know,

73
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,681
eight,

74
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:05,130
10 Indians and some parents and
some gold and some native shit.

75
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,263
And they went,

76
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,621
you know,

77
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:08,454
their minds are blown.

78
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,710
No one knew there was
another world right now.

79
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,001
I mean,

80
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,170
people knew there was another world,

81
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,600
but they didn't know that you
could go find a new one like that.

82
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,250
Like he came back with people from
another place who spoke Airwalk and had

83
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,150
fucking monkeys.

84
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,310
What the fuck is this?

85
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
Here's a bunch of men,

86
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,220
10 times more money,

87
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,300
a bunch more boats.

88
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,670
The second expedition was hugely funded.

89
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
Anyone ever with horses cannons,

90
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,610
the whole fucking and shit.

91
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,630
Wow.

92
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,190
The first one was like,

93
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:37,170
when you send your friend
a fucking home depot,

94
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:37,330
you're,

95
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,220
here's my car.

96
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,750
Don't use the blinker.

97
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,410
You know?

98
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,040
Right.

99
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,700
He barely made it there in
backed on the first one and yes,

100
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,740
he did do all those horrible
things to the Indians.

101
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:50,490
He was no notion of them as people.

102
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,200
He was a strict Catholic.

103
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,360
He believed that he had
been singled out by God.

104
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,440
Just the idea of custody peoples' arms
off cause they didn't bring enough and

105
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,010
doing it in front

106
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,843
of their family.

107
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,860
If he didn't produce precious
goods for the Spanish crown,

108
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,570
that he wasn't going
to keep getting funded.

109
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:12,550
When he went back and that was the driving
to keep going and pushing through to

110
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:17,170
Asia was what he was after to find
China cause he knew there'd be ivory and

111
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,970
pearls and all that Shite toggle.

112
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,400
But look what he look
at it on the other hand,

113
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,620
within 20 or 30 years of Columbus,

114
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,890
now they're in Mexico and within another
hundred years without the largest

115
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:27,940
silver mine in the world,

116
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,410
that giant mountain of silver that all
of the silver of Asia for 400 years came

117
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,950
from because of the Spanish trade
routes between China and shit.

118
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,400
They reduced a mountain of silver in
Mexico and some in South America too.

119
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,680
And use the Indians to fucking
do it on the mountain of silver.

120
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:45,640
I mean,

121
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,250
there's a book called 1493,

122
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,773
uh,

123
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,011
Charles Mann,

124
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,251
well,

125
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,430
new all using Columbus is the line
of demarcation for everything.

126
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,600
There's a book called 1491 and a book
called 1492 and a vehicle because he's the

127
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,724
first contact,

128
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,661
you know,

129
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,880
between west and east or between,

130
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,070
between the Americas and
you and the old world.

131
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,503
And uh,

132
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,190
on his boat he had,

133
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,090
he was Italian,

134
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,500
he had Portuguese,

135
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,610
there was some Spanish,

136
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:12,941
there was some,

137
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:14,770
generally is probably
a couple of Venetians.

138
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,610
Uh,

139
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,630
by the time Cortez,

140
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,500
when Cortez came over,

141
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,041
which is what,

142
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,910
30 years after,

143
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,730
there was women
conquistadores on his boat,

144
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,160
women come case dad.

145
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:25,120
There was about two or three
conquistadores in his book.

146
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,530
Why they don't tell you all the
fun stuff in the game of Thrones.

147
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,300
Exactly.

148
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,210
Big giant warrior.

149
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,210
Imagine what a bad acid or you had
to be to be on that fucking mission.

150
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,440
And Cortez burned the boats and
took a vote with everybody and said,

151
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,560
you want to go back or not?

152
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,041
And they were like,

153
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,371
he goes,

154
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:39,551
okay,

155
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,540
this is how it's going to go.

156
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,280
We know where the capital
of the [inaudible],

157
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,020
this is our mission and let's look,

158
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,180
and they got all the Indians along
the way and that's how they did it.

159
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,170
And they burned the boats.

160
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,070
They couldn't go back.

161
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,700
Yeah.

162
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,220
But according to one book
I read by Bernal Diaz,

163
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,470
who was the last survivor of that mission,

164
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,960
he landed up in like Honduras or whatever,

165
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:00,610
the little ranch when he was old.

166
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,450
He writes the forward,

167
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,500
I'm old and I'm blind now,

168
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,800
but I'm going to tell you what the fuck
happened when on the mission with Cortez

169
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,910
and he'd been on a previous one with
another conquistador and then he says,

170
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,040
he didn't just say
we're burning the boats.

171
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,880
We took a vote.

172
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:13,990
Whoa.

173
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,940
Captain General Cortez said to the boys,

174
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,740
parrot is you can go back to Cuba where
they were living or you can go back to

175
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:25,741
span where you got nothing horsch gold
and fucking glory and to State Lawn and

176
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,630
you may die and they may eat.

177
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,370
You eat your heart out.

178
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,120
It's so such an ability
to take risks back then.

179
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,860
It's pretty extraordinary.

180
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,100
I mean the genocide and the Indians
is of course the disgusting part.

181
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:42,910
But I mean the Aztecs did have
a organized army and you know,

182
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:43,744
it wasn't,

183
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,060
it wasn't a hundred Spanish guys.

184
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,090
They had tens of thousands of Indians
in their army when they finally laid the

185
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,000
big battle out,

186
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,230
Columbus on the other hand just Kinda
maraud around the Caribbean and tried to

187
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,740
get these poor Indians who had no gold
to give him gold and he was in the wrong

188
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,161
country.

189
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,521
Man.

190
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,130
You know America's work oldest,

191
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,501
well,

192
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:07,580
didn't they give him something at some
point in time they get a little baubles

193
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:09,700
but there's bottles had come
from the mainland or you know,

194
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,060
had been traveled across the Caribbean
or from South America where there was

195
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,410
stuff and that they didn't
have any gold there.

196
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,960
So they were weighing little earrings
and nose rings and Shit and he'd be like,

197
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,603
that was it though.

198
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,020
Total focus and they couldn't understand
exterior given him chicks and food and

199
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:24,261
like,

200
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:24,431
well,

201
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:25,340
what else do you want?

202
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,680
We have,

203
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,150
but you don't have fucking the gold.

204
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,710
And why is the golden boy you,

205
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:31,730
it's not important to us.

206
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,564
They were like,

207
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,290
and he just went as
soon as he saw any goal.

208
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,610
That was the end of that.

209
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,360
We have,

210
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,860
how do they have this?

211
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,730
Obviously they have that one account from
Cortez you were talking about from one

212
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:44,270
of the people that,

213
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,451
oh,

214
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,660
there's loads of accounts of
Cortez cause there's fryers,

215
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,120
the row.

216
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,590
How do they have these accounts?

217
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:48,830
Oh,

218
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,500
Columbus wrote a diary and a guy's
on his ship wrote diaries and a,

219
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,400
there's a famous uh,

220
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,550
trees to as the,

221
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:58,400
the sort of the conscience of the new
world who decried the genocide against the

222
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,630
Indians from the very beginning.

223
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,560
And the Spanish kept meticulous records
and there's a giant library in Seville

224
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,270
called the library of the indies where
all of the Caucasians Adores fucking

225
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,490
documents are collated and captain.

226
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,324
So there's,

227
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,010
that's awesome.

228
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,280
There are legal society.

229
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,140
So you brought a priest with you.

230
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,520
You bought a notary with you,

231
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,870
you brought lawyers with you,

232
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,070
you brought generals with you.

233
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,060
You brought a doctor,

234
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,470
you wrote shit down.

235
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:22,304
You fucking,

236
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,570
when you took over a town,

237
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:26,480
you wrote a sign and
posted a crucifix sense.

238
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,510
So how much did you agree to the
Indians who can't understand you,

239
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,540
that you are taking over their town in
the name of the King of Spain and Chen?

240
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,950
How much bullshit,

241
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,930
all of that.

242
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,231
I mean,

243
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:36,840
you know,

244
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,480
so when,

245
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,100
when they would tell their
version of the events,

246
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,050
how much of it was bullshit
histories all spinning,

247
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:42,740
isn't it?

248
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,850
I don't think all of it's bullshit
because there's a lot of real also Indians

249
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,610
wrote accounts later who
lurks within a generation.

250
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,190
Obviously there's Mexicans,

251
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,810
which are the marriage of Indians and,

252
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,671
and Spanish,

253
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:56,390
right?

254
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,920
And uh,

255
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,120
within a generation,

256
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,430
all of the Aztec noble is of which there
were lots and all the nobles in Mexico

257
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,830
from the Indian tribes married into rich,

258
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,221
you know,

259
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,430
married into Spanish family.

260
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:13,431
So they were raised as rich people who
spoke Spanish now and they were able to

261
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,220
tell their stories as well.

262
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,040
There's a lot of first person
accounts by the explorers.

263
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,930
Cabeza de Vaca kept a diary in,

264
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,900
I mean Columbus is is great
because it's so self serving,

265
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:24,530
you know,

266
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,430
he'll knits whole portions of the journey
and he doesn't mention some of the

267
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,060
ratty shitty did and the radish,

268
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,640
it was all ratted out by priests,

269
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:31,880
right?

270
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,330
Yeah.

271
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,290
And then later expeditions
within by the second expedition,

272
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,710
guys were mutinying on him and and
fucking going back to Spain and ratting on

273
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,610
him that he was a terrible and competent
fucking commander and that he had,

274
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,750
once they got on land,

275
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,450
he was useless and he didn't
know how to handle it.

276
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,090
The Indians and there was always in her
violence with the cruise killing each

277
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,780
other and choosing sides and hiding on
different parts of the island from each

278
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,560
other and not doing
what he asked him to do.

279
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,320
He was a terrible commander on the sea.

280
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,600
The greatest thing you
can say about Columbus's,

281
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,420
he's an extraordinary navigator.

282
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,580
He knew that there was going to
be a trade wind and he caught it.

283
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,950
Having had some of that knowledge.

284
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,810
He knew that if he went down and got it,

285
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,220
he could come and get one back.

286
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,720
And I think he guessed that he surmised
lottery knew from other sailors and shit

287
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,260
that you wouldn't
actually get lost in die.

288
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,920
You could come back to Europe from
wherever you were going in Asia.

289
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,470
And he didn't have a,

290
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,160
a telescope.

291
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,080
This is previous to the telescope.

292
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:33,081
So He is dead reckoning and it
was terrible with instruments.

293
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,410
Like he had an astro lab and he had a
sexton but he couldn't fucking use them

294
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,070
very well.

295
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,990
So all of his reckonings in the book,

296
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,600
Andy kept two separate notebooks.

297
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,780
One with his navigational charts and
another with fake ones in case anybody

298
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,530
caught him cause he didn't want anybody
copying is root cause he thought he was

299
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,810
going to have the monopoly
on going to the new world.

300
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,180
So within of course,

301
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:57,930
20 years,

302
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,470
within,

303
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,640
within four years,

304
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,220
there's a whole bunch of other Spanish
vowels coming over and you know,

305
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,840
within 10 years it's all
over those growing levels.

306
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:07,620
So when he first starts writing it down,

307
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:08,610
you said that he's writing,

308
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,990
he's not using instruments.

309
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:10,830
He,

310
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,371
he could,

311
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,540
he had instruments,

312
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,680
they're crappy.

313
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,690
They didn't have any idea of longitude.

314
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:19,524
Right.

315
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,620
Longitude was kind of
a free flowing affair.

316
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,450
If you had shit you could focus on
like stars or bodies of our islands or

317
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,980
whatever the you could now the gate,

318
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,260
which is why those maps of the world
always seemed so small right from then.

319
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,340
Um,

320
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,340
so he had to recommend by currents
and winds and the color of the water,

321
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,443
how the water,

322
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,810
the salinity of the water tested.

323
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,460
They had a rope with thumbs on it,

324
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,300
marked in knots and that take soundings
to see how fucking deep the sea was.

325
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:54,780
And all of a sudden when they got near
and the crew was having a heart attack,

326
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,060
cause they'd been out for a
couple months and it's true.

327
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:57,894
The crew was like,

328
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,920
hey,

329
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,753
we're going to die.

330
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,750
And he said,

331
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,740
calm the fuck down.

332
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,660
And the next day,

333
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:04,710
uh,

334
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,990
clearly something a human had made,

335
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:10,460
like a carved paddle hit the
boat and they pulled it out.

336
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,294
And what,

337
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,283
you know,

338
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,730
there's something over there and then
the next day a bunch of branches and shit

339
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,790
and then birds and when
there's birds and branches,

340
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,310
there's fucking islands and they knew.

341
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,810
Then the men started to get hip
to the fact that he wasn't wrong.

342
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,650
There was something over there.

343
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,940
And then of course he,

344
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,180
he said whoever sees the island first
gets a prize and the guy in the middle of

345
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,990
the night saw the lights and he
said when they got up in the day,

346
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:37,950
I saw him last night.

347
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,633
Oh,

348
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,860
shouted his crew.

349
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,270
So why not her loved him.

350
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,590
What lights did he see?

351
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,731
Fires to?

352
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:45,540
Indians were burning.

353
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,490
Oh Wow.

354
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,443
Fascinating.

355
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:48,721
I know,

356
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:49,130
right.

357
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,963
That's amazing.

358
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,341
It is.

359
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:54,160
It's really weird to think
of their gear navies.

360
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,220
No rifles on the first expedition.

361
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,800
Maybe a couple of,

362
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,800
not rifles like Arca buses that you lit
a fuse and put it in a breach and you

363
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,071
know,

364
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,610
he had to pack it down,

365
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:04,450
pack it down with the ball.

366
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,860
A lot of crossbows,

367
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,860
a few crossbows that was
considered real high tact.

368
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,800
Have those with you.

369
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,750
That was a big deal to have like an
organized group of Cross Bowman because an

370
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:17,310
organized group across go Bowman
could wipe out lots of people out.

371
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,400
We're very accurate.

372
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,510
The armor thing never worked out for
them with all the conquistadores.

373
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,720
Within a few weeks they'd all fucking
started wearing the Indians armor because

374
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,554
it's too hot.

375
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,370
Yeah.

376
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,203
Too much stuff.

377
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,770
They were metal and metal rots in the
jungle and shitness but the Indians had

378
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,780
fabulous cotton textiles that made,

379
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:35,440
made,

380
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,273
you know,

381
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,970
so Columbus is,

382
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:38,480
um,

383
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,530
his journals,

384
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,820
they were all his own way
of measuring the salinity,

385
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,430
his own way of measuring
the color of the water.

386
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,280
So he would just describe
that like that's how he knew

387
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,820
he'd been at sea since he was a teenager.

388
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,360
Genewiz tended to go to ca cause they
were slave traders and there was always a

389
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:57,860
tradition of slavery in Genoa,

390
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,640
which is why he didn't
perceive the Indians,

391
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:02,930
just people as much as his first
thing he wrote back was like,

392
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,300
I think we found a bunch of slaves here.

393
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:05,990
You know?

394
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,740
Wow,

395
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,330
we can use these people to build stuff.

396
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:12,950
And then of course their temperament was
not that way and he didn't manage any

397
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:13,701
of the situations.

398
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:14,091
Right.

399
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:18,440
And he betrayed everybody and that's
why it all went so horribly shit.

400
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:19,910
And all those Indians are dead.

401
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:21,500
There's no Caribbean Indians.

402
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,030
It's just weird

403
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,970
when you stop and think about what
a short amount of time ago that was.

404
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,500
Oh my God.

405
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,060
So short,

406
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,960
Jesus was nothing.

407
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,803
Two years.

408
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,120
500 years seems like a
long time for one person.

409
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,600
But once you've been alive for a little
while and like you're in your forties

410
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,530
and you start looking at you going,

411
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:37,711
you know,

412
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:38,820
that didn't take that long.

413
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,410
It seemed like he moved pretty quick.

414
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,030
How many of these are left?

415
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,950
How many of them do you get in the life?

416
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,500
My mother was 94 when she passed away.

417
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,410
Five of those born in 1919 yeah.

418
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,251
Five lives.

419
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:51,001
Birth to death.

420
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:54,570
And you're dealing with like the most
horrible atrocities that you know we have

421
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:55,520
like on record,

422
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,950
there was times when my mother was born,

423
00:13:58,951 --> 00:13:59,610
there was no,

424
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,181
it's so weird.

425
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:00,781
Radio Sir,

426
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:01,710
growing up in Columbus,

427
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:04,200
Ohio because that's named
after Christopher Columbus.

428
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:06,300
And there's all these
fucking statues everywhere,

429
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:10,680
like just like celebrating this man and
you grew up in school celebrating and

430
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:11,670
it's just weird now.

431
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,130
Well we looked at men and
not at any of reality.

432
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,443
Keep talking.

433
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,363
Should we?

434
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:17,681
Oh,

435
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:17,951
okay.

436
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:18,880
We can adjourn if you like.

437
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,351
I know.

438
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:20,770
Right.

439
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,910
And if you get to Seville,

440
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,170
there's a giant statue of him.

441
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,640
Uh,

442
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,560
and there's one in Barcelona chair
looking out over the scene now.

443
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,030
And then the statue in Seville is in the
cathedral and he's being carried in a

444
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,270
litter,

445
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,780
you know,

446
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,780
by four Indians from different tribes
and they're wearing their Indian garb.

447
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,530
And he's in a big brass
that are like that.

448
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,560
And his foot is rubbed completely shiny,

449
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,590
cause it's good luck to rub club
foot in Seville was on a river.

450
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,280
And every year when the,

451
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,140
the fleet would come back to
treasure fleet from the new world,

452
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,030
they'd be ladened down like almost to
the water line with fucking gold and

453
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,740
precious goods and people and stuff.

454
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,520
And they'd come up the river and there
was a chain across the river and Sybil.

455
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,440
And they'd pull the chain out.

456
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,460
And,

457
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,080
and it's sail up the river.

458
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:15,340
And that was a big event every year
because when the treasure fleet came to

459
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:15,740
Oculus,

460
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,520
like,

461
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,620
and of course Spanish people
got none of that money.

462
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,610
Just the crown.

463
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,830
And then what did they do?

464
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,480
Wage war against the French and the hall,

465
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,690
the Dutch and the English for fucking
300 years and blew all the money.

466
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,840
[inaudible]

467
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,790
you're a fucking human being.
