1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,870
So after you got through this,

3
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:05,050
yeah.

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,850
What made you do four and five?

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,610
The carrot of like,

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,180
just wait a little,

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,033
make sense.

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,791
Here's what they do.

9
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,740
They set up that you're the auditor now,

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,370
so you're,

11
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,890
you're auditing these things in your body.

12
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:19,060
You're now the boss.

13
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:19,960
So they go,

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,591
they tell you,

15
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,910
get your head on like your,

16
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,020
it's your job.

17
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,880
You don't need to believe anything.

18
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,340
You just need to audit them.

19
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,920
So you need to do your job as an auditor.

20
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,731
That's what they're called.

21
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:34,810
Auditor's people who are the ones who
take you into session and Scientology,

22
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,380
right?

23
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,840
So you feel like you're
in a leadership role.

24
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,520
So you're doing these things a favor,

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,301
you know,

26
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:40,601
and you're like,

27
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:40,691
well,

28
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:41,411
maybe it's true.

29
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:41,831
I don't know.

30
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:42,071
I mean,

31
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,110
I do sometimes hear voices and you know,

32
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:44,321
like,

33
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:44,651
you know,

34
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,360
you have a moment with
yourself and you're like,

35
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,890
I might be really kind of crazy.

36
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:48,941
Um,

37
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:49,511
so you're like,

38
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,740
maybe this was an answer.

39
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:51,220
It's,

40
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,220
it's sick because it speaks to a side
of you that wants answers about life,

41
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:56,711
you know?

42
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:57,311
And then you're like,

43
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:57,641
no,

44
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,870
this is some crazy shit,

45
00:00:58,871 --> 00:00:59,111
man,

46
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:02,490
that there wasn't even
the people that what?

47
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,280
No,

48
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,480
you know it it.

49
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,261
Listen,

50
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,330
you believe what you want
to believe at the time.

51
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,490
Does it feel to you at the moment,

52
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:12,100
like maybe if you just keep going,

53
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:12,934
it'll get better.

54
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,880
And I'm confused now,

55
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,160
but if I contemplate
this and I write it over,

56
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,010
eventually I'm going to
receive enough information,

57
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:21,171
right?

58
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:22,120
This is all going to be like,

59
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,560
oh right.

60
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,580
I was a fool.

61
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,414
I didn't understand.

62
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,170
Right?

63
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,130
So for example,

64
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:29,020
one time I had talked
to a friend about it,

65
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,921
I said,

66
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:30,161
you know,

67
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:30,891
I heard some of us,

68
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,860
some Xenu Shit.

69
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,033
She,

70
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,780
she pulled me into celebrity center so
fast into a secured room and she handed

71
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:41,511
me my ass.

72
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:41,771
She said,

73
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:45,670
don't you ever say that word
outside of secured room?

74
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm writing a knowledge report on you.

75
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,501
She said,

76
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:48,334
I'm writing room.

77
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,280
You never say that word out loud
in a room that's not secured.

78
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,941
Okay.

79
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,020
And never seen again.

80
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,620
So she wrote a report on the report.

81
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,960
She wrote a knowledge report on me.

82
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,640
I got sent to what's called ethics,

83
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:03,740
which is like the Justice
Department of celebrities of,

84
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,900
of Scientology.

85
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,070
And they said,

86
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,040
they brought me into another secured room
because they have to get somebody who

87
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,360
knows this information.

88
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,140
And they said,

89
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,140
never ever say that w say this.

90
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,160
It never confirm it.

91
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,030
Never deny it.

92
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,640
Never give that information out ever.

93
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,960
That just never discuss it.

94
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,040
Just say I'd never heard of it.

95
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:21,880
You sound crazy.

96
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,740
Wow.

97
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,490
And then I also,

98
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,960
this is all just theories of course,

99
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:26,370
and I'm not going to research any of this,

100
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,150
but,

101
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,630
um,

102
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,380
I think parents try to outdo each other
with their stories about what the fuck

103
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:31,831
they felt.

104
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,610
And it's just like,

105
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,120
they're really,

106
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,953
they're really like,

107
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,220
they're not saying people,

108
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,450
most parents know.

109
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,970
And I've learned to
kind of already be like,

110
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:39,804
um,

111
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,790
they'll just sit down next to you,

112
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,150
like your Forrest Gump and they'll just
sit down and just start talking to you.

113
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,901
So he just said,

114
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:46,230
your kid,

115
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,501
all right,

116
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,670
well this is what you
got to watch out for.

117
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:47,941
You know what?

118
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:48,840
I remember my kid and Blah,

119
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:49,021
blah,

120
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:49,710
blah blah,

121
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:49,921
dude.

122
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,820
It's like airplane.

123
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,650
You know what I mean with
with a fucking person,

124
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,600
he talks to them and you
want to kill yourself.

125
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,950
Just wait until he
started going to school.

126
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,853
Ooh.

127
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,460
Then you've got to,

128
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,110
you've got to hang out with
these parents all the time.

129
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,980
Your kid's become

130
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
friends with their kids and then you,

131
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,330
you become friends with these people
that you would never be fucking friends

132
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,500
with this.

133
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,410
This is what I do is I just look
straight ahead and I don't look at him,

134
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,730
I don't respond to what they're saying.

135
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,060
And then they just sort of the talk
quieter and they gradually leave.

136
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,670
You're going to have to go to dinner
with them and your wife's can be friends

137
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,451
with some lady.

138
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:16,721
You're going to,

139
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:17,590
well let's go on a double date.

140
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,281
Okay fine.

141
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,750
You're going to go this one guy now
he talks and he doesn't look at you.

142
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,260
He tells me these fucking stupid stories
about his kid and the basketball team

143
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,270
and he looks at you for a second.

144
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,750
So,

145
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,330
so Adam's in his basketball and
then he starts looking down.

146
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,580
He's in that did the coach won't put
them in the game and I'm saying like if

147
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,310
he's a good player,

148
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,751
she could play,

149
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,751
how can we not can put them in the game
and he's fucking bling rambling with no

150
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:43,030
regard whatsoever for your attention span.

151
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,770
The entertainment value
of what he's saying.

152
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,580
He's just the underlying insecurity of
not being able to look at you or he's

153
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,800
selling self-involved,

154
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,020
he's self involved and is doing some
weird thing with his hands where he's like

155
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,610
click talking with his
hands and I'm going,

156
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,660
Jesus Christ.

157
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,160
It's literally like someone squish,

158
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,700
fantasize about doing to them,

159
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,860
not just running,

160
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,401
just running away.

161
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,001
I don't want to hurt him.

162
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,050
The guy's hurt by life.

163
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,580
He's so damaged by live.

164
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:04,510
I don't want to do anything to them.

165
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,710
I just wanna get the fuck away.

166
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,710
I always picture those people and
I have a giant roll of duct tape.

167
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,060
I just put it on the,

168
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,930
it's like a cartoon level speak.

169
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:14,890
No,

170
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,691
it's cartoon level.

171
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:16,920
I just put it on their mouth and I go,

172
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,530
and the last one,

173
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,710
it comes up and over their
head and then it hangs down.

174
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:26,970
The whole rest of the tape is
hanging down over there awkwardly.

175
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,660
And then I just go back
to eating or whatever,

176
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,210
and they just sit there and
slowly have to take it off.

177
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,630
There's some brutal fucking people.

178
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,290
It's,

179
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:38,591
you know,

180
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:41,300
there's a bunch of weird people that you,

181
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,621
you know,

182
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:44,890
you get closer to them and closer to
them and you find out about their life.

183
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,880
Yeah.

184
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,211
But you know,

185
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:46,841
when all those people,

186
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,471
I want to do that too.

187
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm sure they're talking about me,

188
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:48,640
so.

189
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:48,791
Oh,

190
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,610
for sure.

191
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,180
Yeah.

192
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,381
Yeah.

193
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:51,790
I'm sure they talk about me too.

194
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,020
That's just how it goes.

195
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:55,240
Seemed like he was in a
bad mood all the time.

196
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,383
Yeah.

197
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,881
Yeah.

198
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,170
This is friend of Ron White's,

199
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,490
who's a friend of mine who,

200
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:00,671
uh,

201
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:01,810
the first time he met me he's like,

202
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:01,961
oh,

203
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,441
I don't know.

204
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:02,921
And Ron's like,

205
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,341
I'm telling you,

206
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,031
he's a good guy.

207
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:04,660
Like,

208
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,770
he's a dad too,

209
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,360
and we're all buddies together now,

210
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:07,841
but he's like,

211
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,211
I don't know.

212
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:08,860
I just,

213
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,693
I'm guarded.

214
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,730
I've been beaten down by some of
these fucking basketball stories.

215
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,920
It's these assholes and tell you and my,

216
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,340
he could,

217
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,160
he's a good player.

218
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,760
He's a good player.

219
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,710
Did just want to put them in the game.

220
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,460
Okay.

221
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,821
Do you just,

222
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,940
you think of things that you would torture
somebody talking about and you like,

223
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:25,780
I would never do this to you.

224
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:26,620
Why are you doing this to me?

225
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,470
You're not even thinking
about verbal water.

226
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,123
Yeah,

227
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,530
like in your own little Guantanamo.

228
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,640
That's a great way describing like
when is the dessert tray coming?

229
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,530
I would say I don't need dessert,

230
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,491
so what should we do,

231
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:41,210
Gary Vee,

232
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:41,960
let's wrap this up.

233
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,740
What should we do?

234
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,573
What should people do?

235
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,890
People should fucking stop complaining.

236
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,770
Right?

237
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,000
Good.

238
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,691
Call the fuck.

239
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:48,890
They are good call.

240
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,840
People should not listen to America.

241
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,480
Propaganda of fixing
the shit they suck at.

242
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:55,670
They should be tripling down
on what they're good at.

243
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,220
They should be competent in certain

244
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,910
areas,

245
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,910
but you're not going to become Beyonce
or your bone structure is a certain way,

246
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,740
like you're not going to solve everything.

247
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,050
Your Iq can get a little bit better,

248
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,820
but don't worry about the incremental.

249
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,840
Figure out what you fucking puts you on
fire and you're halfway decent at it.

250
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,890
If you're lucky enough right now to be
listening and you're good at what you

251
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,891
like become tunnel fucking vision because
there's way too many voices telling

252
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,670
you what and how.

253
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,660
And here's the other thing,

254
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,411
and this is the big one,

255
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:27,680
Joe,

256
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,090
because you have a humongous audience.

257
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,980
The biggest thing that I've seen dividends
from have the conversation with the

258
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,390
person that's holding you back.

259
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,610
The reason most people who
are listening right now,

260
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:41,330
we're not doing that thing is they're
worried about the opinion of somebody,

261
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,070
usually their mother,

262
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,260
usually their father.

263
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,360
And the reality is is that your spouse
may be the person holding you back and

264
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,660
you have to have that conversation.

265
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,400
Turn them off.

266
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,930
We have to get to a place where you're
doing you because the number one thing

267
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:58,760
that scares the fuck out of me is regret.

268
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,700
And you're going to sit there
at 72 and he going to say,

269
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,480
I wish,

270
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,931
I wish,

271
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:03,620
I wish.

272
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,780
And whether that's money or
spend more time with your family.

273
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,130
There's a million ways to do this.

274
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,840
Not everybody wants to buy the jets.

275
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,410
Not everybody wants to smoke
weed on the beach in Bahamas.

276
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,150
Like everybody's got a
different fucking thing.

277
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,750
Figure out what your fucking thing is
and stop making fucking bullshit excuses

278
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
who the president is.

279
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,710
Your mom did this like,

280
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
like I missed it.

281
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,540
I had that idea for Uber.

282
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,310
Then why didn't you fucking do it Dick?

283
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,471
That's what I think.

284
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:28,490
Joe Margarel,

285
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,750
this is not about parties.

286
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,250
We're taking these people on.

287
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,160
We're bringing God back in even smaller.

288
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,740
That wasn't very religious like Trump
has gotten religion learning about this

289
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,880
because let me tell you something.

290
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:41,750
Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves
God and he's been briefed on all this

291
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,600
and he's going to roll their ass up
so the pedophiles better get ready.

292
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,011
I want to,

293
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,250
I want you to clear
something up right now.

294
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,350
Look at that camera and tell
everybody you're not bill Hicks.

295
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,720
So stupid.

296
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,430
Tell him you're not.

297
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,263
I'm not either.

298
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:52,910
Tell them.

299
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,150
Well,

300
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,930
number one,

301
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,760
people think there's
a God damn conspiracy.

302
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,741
Here's what happens.

303
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:58,780
They think it's a flat earth too.

304
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
I take real stuff.

305
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,190
Notice Joe's done is researched,

306
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:01,940
not kissing his ass.

307
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,320
So he knows all these little points.

308
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:03,541
I May,

309
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,610
he'd better than I even did.

310
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,230
I'm like remembering stuff
when he brings it up.

311
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,240
Cause I tried to suppress half this crap.

312
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,021
I can't handle it anymore,

313
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:09,201
man.

314
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,530
I'm 43 and I'm sitting here
looking at all this and then,

315
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,120
and these people come up to
me on the street and they go,

316
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,960
hey Joe,

317
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,351
hey Joe.

318
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,220
Something like five times.

319
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,340
And then I,

320
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,811
I tried like,

321
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:18,021
Oh,

322
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:18,590
I knew you were,

323
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,070
you know,

324
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,811
were were,

325
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:20,030
uh,

326
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,271
I mean,

327
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,110
not just Jones,

328
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,830
Alex,

329
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,310
whatever,

330
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,080
whatever your fucking name is Alex Jones.

331
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,340
The program is Jerian killing.

332
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,310
I say Bill Hicks.

333
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,180
Oh,

334
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,013
they say,

335
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,651
here's the,

336
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:33,080
I'll be on the street or I'll be at a
restaurant and they come over and they go,

337
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,370
they say,

338
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,881
hey bill,

339
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,211
hey bill.

340
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:35,840
Hey Bill.

341
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,160
I,

342
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,993
they don't really show Rogan.

343
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,890
And,

344
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,580
and I'm,

345
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,413
and I turn around and go,

346
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:40,571
oh,

347
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:45,571
I know it's you all because I did a few
pieces and one little video with a guy

348
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,180
that lived in Austin that you
knew that's how I met you,

349
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,030
but you don't like Bill Hicks.

350
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,620
That's what's ridiculous about it.

351
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,401
Like what'd you get?

352
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:56,250
Like massive plastic surgery changed the
way your voice sounds like your voice

353
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,200
is so different than his,

354
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,750
all the testing is that no one ever
wants to look real conspiracies cause

355
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:02,040
they're complex and hard to understand.

356
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,860
They want to just go
with the earth is flat.

357
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,401
Uh,

358
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:05,641
you know,

359
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,350
there's aliens living
underneath the capitol.

360
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,180
Dinosaurs aren't real or,

361
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:09,301
well,

362
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:09,451
no,

363
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:09,850
I mean,

364
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,560
listen,

365
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,300
the point is I'm look at a bash.

366
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:12,531
Eddie.

367
00:09:12,531 --> 00:09:12,990
Eddie has,

368
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,120
yeah,

369
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,340
it's good to have a free open mind,

370
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,350
but he doesn't promulgate stuff.

371
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,000
He's only researching what's been said.

372
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,560
So I want to just get this out of the way.

373
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,610
I am Bill Hicks.

374
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,421
I'm actually,

375
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,680
you are how old Bill Hicks be?

376
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,523
Like 60.

377
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,390
Um,

378
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,290
I think he died at 32 and 1994.

379
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:29,851
So,

380
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:30,684
uh,

381
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,260
do the math.

382
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,300
I know one thing it's
hot in here isn't really,

383
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,731
I don't,

384
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:34,310
I'm not hot.

385
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,143
You hot?

386
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,790
Nope.

387
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,260
I was getting my studio it really cold.

388
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,960
Oh dear.

389
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,240
Well you get,

390
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,070
you get crazy.

391
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,710
You're a Goddamn Elton inferno.

392
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,593
I'm melting.

393
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,270
Yeah.
