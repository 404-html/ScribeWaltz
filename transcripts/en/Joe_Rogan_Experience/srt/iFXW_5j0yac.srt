1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,110
My day,

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,810
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,270
So you were asking me before this
about the fights this weekend.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,911
What are you feeling?

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,430
Finger because where they were
counter starker that's why they,

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,490
they keep the distance and
they'd know exactly that.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,150
This is what I think a lot of
people were like pissed off.

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,140
It was boring.

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,350
But I think that's because they just
want to see people beat the fuck out of

10
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:22,681
each other,

11
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,110
which I understand that's why
you tuned into cage fighting.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,320
But to me the way I always described
martial arts is it's high level problem

13
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,940
solving with dire physical consequences.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,430
And if you run in on Tyron Woodley,

15
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:37,830
you got some dire physical consequences.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,420
He's a fucking powerhouse.

17
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,540
And if Woodley charges at Thompson,

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,440
there's dire physical consequences cause
he was getting tagged when he would he

19
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:47,850
need set it to me after the fight.

20
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:48,091
He's like,

21
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,790
he caught me a few times as
I was charging towards him.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,690
So Woodley has a different
style in Thompson.

23
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:56,550
Thompson has that wide stance,

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,690
that karate style and he's excellent at
moving in and moving out and almost like

25
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:01,560
point fighting you.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,970
He's just jabbing you,

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,990
hitting you with these,

28
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,440
uh,

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,550
clean left hands,

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,810
sliding out of the way.

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,550
Occasionally throwing kicks.

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,930
But mostly what he's doing is making you
wonder what he's gonna do and when he's

33
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,380
coming at you and Woodley had to pick
his battles and figure out when he could

34
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,400
launch himself at them.

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,760
So at any moment something
could have happened,

36
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,950
but a lot of shit didn't happen.

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,410
So the people watching at home,

38
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:25,780
but that was more boring forever.

39
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,400
It's because those
moments are so critical.

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,470
Those moments are so dangerous.

41
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,370
You can't just,

42
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,690
they would like it to be like Frankie
Edgar Gray Maynard just fucking chaos or

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,320
punches throwing wild.

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,200
Not going to happen like that.

45
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,570
You can't do that with Wonderboy.

46
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,900
You can't charge at him like that.

47
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,030
He will fucking counter you and you look,

48
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,220
you will be one of those
people on his highlight reel.

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,120
So Tyron Woodley was very smart and that
he knew that he couldn't charge Adam

50
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,500
and Wonderboy.

51
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,870
He's not going to charge a willy either.

52
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,141
I mean,

53
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,540
he got an almost knocked the
fuck out in the first fight.

54
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,250
He almost got knocked the fuck out in the,

55
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,570
in the fifth round or the second
fight to Woodley's a powerhouse man.

56
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,160
He hits so goddamn hard.

57
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,410
So everybody had to be on their toes.

58
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,390
They both had to be
minding their p's and q's.

59
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,630
And that translated for a
boring fight to a lot of people,

60
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,613
but not to me.

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,251
To me,

62
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:14,760
I was like,

63
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,050
anything could happen at any moment
in the fifth round or almost did when,

64
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,500
when,

65
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,420
when Woodley connected and
Thompson's knees went out,

66
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:21,631
I mean,

67
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:22,291
he slumped,

68
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:22,881
he was out,

69
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:23,340
man.

70
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,630
He was out for at least a half,

71
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,100
a second or a moment.

72
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:26,580
You know,

73
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,190
there was a moment
where his legs gave out.

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,610
His body went limp and they could've
stopped the fight right there.

75
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
I'm glad they didn't,

76
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:33,690
uh,

77
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,560
glad they kept going.

78
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,820
I talked to a big John McCarthy
in the cage after the fight ago,

79
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,200
how close we were to stop in that fight.

80
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,034
He goes,

81
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,401
he goes,

82
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,151
I wasn't close to stop.

83
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:42,530
And I fight.

84
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:42,721
I go,

85
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:42,841
what?

86
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,561
You were looking right?

87
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,040
He goes,

88
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,873
I was looking.

89
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,600
I go,

90
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,411
you were looking to close.

91
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:46,651
He goes,

92
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,550
I'll never admit it.

93
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,111
I go,

94
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:48,271
it was,

95
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:48,870
but it was,

96
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,060
I mean he was almost out right.

97
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,281
He goes,

98
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:51,114
he was almost out.

99
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,620
It might've been out for half a second,

100
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,260
but he,

101
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,091
I gave him a chance.

102
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,080
I know you did a great job.

103
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,160
He did an amazing job.

104
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,980
I mean that's why big John
McCarthy is so important.

105
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,930
The guy with that kind of
experience and if he fucked that up,

106
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,340
everybody would be so mad at him.

107
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,660
But he did it perfect.

108
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,680
It was perfect.

109
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,500
He has the most difficult
job in the sport.

110
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,640
Other than the fighters.

111
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,350
Fighters have the most difficult job.

112
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,660
Second most difficult job is the referee.

113
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,770
Third most difficult job is a judges.

114
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,710
I think so,

115
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,270
yeah.

116
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,100
I believe it's going to
interpret the trauma.

117
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,590
Yes.

118
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,390
40 other people.

119
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,230
Well he has to be,

120
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,981
he has to look,

121
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,240
he has to be at the right angle.

122
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,350
Like they're moving around and they're
fast and they could go to his left and he

123
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:29,891
can be over here,

124
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,630
but something could be happening on there.

125
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,021
Right.

126
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,070
And he doesn't even see it.

127
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,821
You know,

128
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,540
you don't know.

129
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,200
Like sometimes,

130
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,730
sometimes guys don't see taps.

131
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,630
Sometimes guys don't see a
certain I pokes or groin shots.

132
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,250
There's a lot of things that can happen.

133
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,230
A referee's job is insanely difficult
and they only get praise when they fuck

134
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,010
up.

135
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,840
They only rather get
attention when they fuck up.

136
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,400
They don't get any praise when they do a
great job and just just they need more,

137
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:54,641
you know,

138
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,200
the they'd need more.

139
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,260
More people need to understand
like how difficult that is.

140
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,500
So that moment where Tyron finally did
connect on Wonderboy and everybody's

141
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:04,871
like,

142
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,010
why didn't you do that earlier?

143
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,720
Because he could've gotten
knocked the fuck out.

144
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,670
Like that was where the opening was.

145
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,270
Woodley was so aggressive because
he was down on the scorecards,

146
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,230
at least in his corner's eyes and in my
eyes he was as well and he had a charge

147
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,600
forward and he had to connect and he did.

148
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,910
But to make that happen,

149
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,980
a lot of things have to be in place.

150
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,750
You have to understand
one of the boys timing,

151
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,240
he had been fighting him
for four rounds already.

152
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,120
He was getting a sense of what
Wonderboy could and couldn't do.

153
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,680
He also knew the consequences.

154
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:36,780
He'd been tagged a couple of times so he
knew like I can't just rush Adam cause

155
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,190
Wonderboy was trying to time
them with that right hook.

156
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,980
He was standing on the South Pole
position with his right leg forward.

157
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,140
He throws that front leg
side kick to the body,

158
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,850
throws it really well because he,

159
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,050
he picks it up from the
ground like low and,

160
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,290
and,

161
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,200
and it's sort of scoops up so you don't
see it coming until it's too late.

162
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,890
It might not be the most powerful
application of the front leg side kick,

163
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,933
but it's very,

164
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,440
it's very sneaky because he slides in
with that foot low and then it comes up

165
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:05,950
and stabs you and you don't know if it's
going to come up as a sidekick or if

166
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,320
it's going to go up and over
your shoulders around kick.

167
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,460
You don't know what he's doing.

168
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,780
He's so sneaky.

169
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,310
So Tyron had to be very cautious and
for a lot of people it was very boring

170
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,144
because of that.

171
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,560
But I didn't think it was boring.

172
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,191
Wall's happening.

173
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,180
I was on the edge of my seat.

174
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,403
I was just like,

175
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,221
there are moments,

176
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,500
there's going to be moments
when the shit starts flying.

177
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,970
And in those moments,

178
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,620
that's where the fight becomes amazing.

179
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,090
But those guys are smart.

180
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,380
They're not dumb.

181
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,780
And the belt is so God damn important.

182
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,770
When you have the belt,

183
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,970
you get to decide,

184
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,440
you fight all the best fighters,

185
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:35,951
you,

186
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:36,281
you,

187
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:36,490
you,

188
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,630
you make the money.

189
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:37,991
You know,

190
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:41,140
you get the opportunities for the big
money fights like the Conor McGregor type

191
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:41,411
fights.

192
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,820
Those only happen if you have the belt.

193
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,900
If you don't have the belt,

194
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,830
nobody gives a fuck about.

195
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,410
So for a guy like Tyron,

196
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:47,651
man,

197
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,000
that belt is everything.

198
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,720
For a guy like woody or
a guy like a Wonderboy,

199
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,001
rather,

200
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,080
that belt is everything.

201
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:53,920
If you don't have that belt,

202
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,870
you make a fraction of what you make.

203
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,150
Like think about that fight
that flight's insanely close.

204
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,013
It was so close.

205
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,440
Dominick Cruz afterwards that that's
basically the same fight as the first

206
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:03,661
fight,

207
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,040
right?

208
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,260
It's like you could call if you've
called the first fighter to draw,

209
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,690
you could easily call this fight
to draw and I agree with him.

210
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,940
And so that means that Wonderboy and
Woodley are essentially like so closely

211
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,940
matched stylistically that it's a wash.

212
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,660
Right.

213
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,870
But meanwhile Woodley's the one who's the
champion Woodley's the one who has the

214
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:21,531
potential to fight.

215
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,950
Conor McGregor Woodley is the one who
has a potential to fight Michael Bisping

216
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,400
or whoever,

217
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,060
who else he fights at whatever weight
he fights at and that is where the money

218
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:29,570
is.

219
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,280
So he's the guy who's
going to get the money.

220
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Whereas Wonderboy who essentially had a
draw with him prove that he was it least

221
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,390
close enough on one fight and just
a hair under the second fight,

222
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,170
he ma,

223
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,170
he's going to make a fraction of
what Woodley mix likely so that those

224
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:50,900
consequences have to be
taken into consideration when
you're watching these guys

225
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:54,200
fight is that they know there's
a wind bonus and there's a loss.

226
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,880
Like if you,

227
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,714
if you lose,

228
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
you get your show money,

229
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,000
you don't get a bonus.

230
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,961
But if you win,

231
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,190
you get twice the money.

232
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,400
Like a lot of guys have,

233
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,980
the way their contract is structured,

234
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,341
you know,

235
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:09,341
they'll make x if they win and they'll
make x plus x if they'll make x plus x if

236
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:10,251
they win.

237
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:10,821
But if they lose,

238
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:11,630
they only make x.

239
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,680
So they might have,

240
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,690
they might be getting
$200,000 for the fight,

241
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,460
but another $200,000 if they win,

242
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,900
that's a giant swing.

243
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,071
That's a big deal.

244
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,720
So they have to be really fucking careful.

245
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:21,770
They don't make mistakes.

246
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,990
I don't like when bonuses,

247
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:24,824
man,

248
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,693
I don't like it.

249
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,770
I think those guys are
trying to win anyway.

250
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,581
They're trying to win.

251
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:28,911
I just,

252
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:29,720
I just think like,

253
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,700
especially in particular
in situations like that,

254
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,860
when fights are like that fucking clothes,

255
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,730
I could judge,

256
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:38,330
can decide whether or not you make
an extra 200 grand or don't like,

257
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,470
that seems crazy to me.

258
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,880
Okay.
