1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,200
Dah,
Dah,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,033
Dah,
Dah.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,480
We are live.
That'd be the black bottle we're

4
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,730
discussing how annoying it is.
A,

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,570
I listened to the podcast and episode
that I did with Whitney Cummings.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,470
I was listening to it because it had the
long drive back from Irvine and I

7
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,690
realized how annoying it is.
I'm always clearing my throat.

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,040
I was telling Jamie he makes the best
butter coffee,

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,190
but it's a stout batch and it gives you
a lot.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,570
A lot of butter.
So yeah,

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,410
it's good though.
Taste goddamn good.

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,750
It's like a hug
hug.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,230
Tate says about coffee tape from Quebec
or I'm coughing.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,780
He says it's like a warm hug.
That's what it is.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,230
I was with Keith Jardine.
Uh,

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,500
I kind of ran into him at the airport
and we were where we were somewhere.

17
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,060
I can't remember if he said,
you got to follow me.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:48,961
I said,
well,

19
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:49,830
I think that's just follow me.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,570
There's a very special coffee place
here.

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,370
And literally I'm like,
okay,

22
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,280
I don't know where I'm going.
And we walked a mile,

23
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:01,170
like airports brings me to this place.
This is the one place they have very

24
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,290
good coffee.
And it talks kind of like really Kinda

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,880
and uh,
they were closing and he said,

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,950
do you mind staying open just a little
bit longer?

27
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,990
And the guy was like,
look at his ears.

28
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:10,531
And he's like,
I,

29
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,420
I suppose.
He goes,

30
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,650
thank you.
We'll have a couple of these coffees.

31
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:16,620
Police guy pushes the coffees.
And then it was just so funny to watch

32
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:21,050
this brute of a man sip the coffee with
such detail and,

33
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,180
and break down this taste.
He's like,

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,160
lot of citrus in this.
It sounds like you're about to get

35
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:29,590
raped.
Well then I felt know,

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,520
but then I just suck this because I
don't really want to come with me.

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,870
Can you stay open?
We don't really want to just stay open.

38
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:40,530
This weird.
I'm going to talk to you about

39
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,020
something.
Nobody gives a fuck about flavor of

40
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:47,070
coffee now.
Now I want you to smell my breath after

41
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,770
I drank it and get a little closer to my
mouth.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,290
Now let's go ahead and drink deeply of
my lips.

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,580
No,
for real though.

44
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,960
Keith loves coffee.
Oh,

45
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,780
he's the smartest.
Do very smart.

46
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,920
And He loves to go to coffee shops.
I remember when we were training

47
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,530
together,
we get done draining and he would take

48
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,820
off to a bookstore or a coffee shop,
put on his glasses are just read and sip

49
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:06,810
coffee.
It was like,

50
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:07,980
Damn.
I love it.

51
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.
He's a smart dude.

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,040
Very misunderstood guy.
Keith Jardine.

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,130
Nicest guy of all time.
Yeah.

54
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,000
If you got a problem with keep charging,
you might be a piece of shit.

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,240
That's right.
You got a problem with all of this.

56
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,150
How is it even possible?
Nice.

57
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,410
Yeah.
He's just a very unusual,

58
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,470
interesting,
humble guy who fucking loves coffee.

59
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,040
Has this tate tate loves this shit.
Take drinks too much.

60
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,480
Taito.
Sit here and he'll.

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,390
We'll do a podcast together.
The motherfucker will down for Nitros.

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Each nitrile is 270 milligrams of
caffeine.

63
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,580
Dude,
we.

64
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,270
We're in this.
We're in this case.

65
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,550
Where were we at in Texas?
In Dallas.

66
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,560
We are one of his clubs.
We had our after parties.

67
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:48,000
Honky tonk place.
Yeah,

68
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,620
something like that.
And it was bro.

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,260
I have four kegs at night.
I was like,

70
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,250
it's one in the morning.
I was supposed to do with it.

71
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,840
You go all night,
man.

72
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,380
You don't understand.
He's sober,

73
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,980
sober and he'll use a lot of butter in
that beard.

74
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:06,610
He leaves a lot of butter in that beard.
Beard was not above grabbing me about

75
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,650
the waste and pulling me right into his
lap.

76
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,790
I'm sitting in your lap right now and I,
I'm afraid to move out of the way.

77
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,910
She smells like a bookstore is like a
unique smell.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,320
Like a hippie bookstore.
Yeah,

79
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:21,770
like,
like wax and tattered cover.

80
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,400
You call it the.
Oh,

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,400
I call it possibility.
He smells like woodstock,

82
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,930
but see a lot of those dudes that are
sober and you know,

83
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,230
I love Keith Keith tape to death.
I love both of them,

84
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,120
but I love to death like tate's my
brother.

85
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:41,740
I love that guy.
Does a lot of the alcoholics anonymous

86
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,840
guys.
Any any sobriety guys?

87
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,480
They drink a lot of pot of coffee.
That's like,

88
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,640
that's where they're getting their to
just get a little charge,

89
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,580
a manageable charge that doesn't fuck up
your life,

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,593
but it gives you a little.

91
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,870
They like it.
Some of them like cigarettes.

92
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,390
Unfortunately.
Coffee and cigarettes together for

93
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:01,120
alcoholics like my boys.
I don't know if you're doing.

94
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,810
I mean I guess you're not ruining your
life in terms of decision making with

95
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,910
the cigarettes.
Like it would be with the booze in your

96
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:09,960
body up though.
Still a nicotine addiction more.

97
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,740
It's replacing one addiction for
another.

98
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,780
It depends on how much you're boozing
though,

99
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,160
right?
I bet you could kill yourself.

100
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,330
Well,
you could definitely kill yourself in

101
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,660
one night with booze and you can't do
that with cigarettes.

102
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,870
No,
so I guess it's more toxic to drunk.

103
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,450
A lot of those addicts become like
marathon runners because the endorphins

104
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,510
that you get from running long,
it's the same thing.

105
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,210
So he get all skinny.
I was that.

106
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:34,570
I was with Joe Schilling yesterday and
it's just so cool to watch that guy just

107
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:38,920
light up to be just a world champion
kickboxer and then just smoke a

108
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:39,790
cigarette once in a while.

109
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,950
It's just like,
I'm so fucking tobacco.

110
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:45,070
Doesn't fucking fuck with me man.
I'll kick cancer into us.

111
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,860
I was like,
how long you been smoking goes since I

112
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,630
was 12.
Yeah.

113
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:52,570
It's unfortunate because I think it
slows them down a little bit.

114
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:56,050
Joe's awesome even with it,
but I definitely think it's a

115
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,180
performance detriment.
It just is.

116
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,260
If a sport relies on cardio is a huge
factor,

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,560
why would you personally limit one of
the biggest factors you could mean you

118
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:12,340
can mitigate it somewhat with hard
training and a healthy lifestyle and

119
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,770
moderation.
Only smoke a few days.

120
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,430
You can admit it may mitigate it,
but think about a sport where people are

121
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:23,431
trying so hard for little tiny fucking
bumps have improved at that level.

122
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,560
Yeah,
about one percent world champion.

123
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Like sometimes they hold on to zero
difference between.

124
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,130
I mean the amount of decrease in
performance you would get from smoking

125
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:36,850
cigarettes versus the amount of increase
in performance you could get from taking

126
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:37,890
some things.
Like,

127
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,380
what's this shit they keep getting
popped with the Russian boxer just got

128
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,840
blood wod Maloney.
I mean,

129
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,030
what is it called?
Jamie?

130
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,450
Jamie.
See if you could find that please.

131
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,050
It's um,
I think it's called [inaudible].

132
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,950
Like a version of EPO.
Like it raises your redlands Novinski

133
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,940
explained it to me,
but a lot of Russian guys are getting

134
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:56,120
caught with it all.
Well,

135
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,960
but here's the thing is,
is

136
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,100
what's important.
It was legal until December,

137
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,610
but it's going back to Joe Schilling.
This is my only and I don't advocate

138
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,720
smoking ever.
Right?

139
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,390
My family members die from it,
cancer,

140
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,350
all that stuff.
But with Joe Schilling,

141
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,200
a guy like that,
if he smokes every now and then,

142
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,340
I don't know how often he smoked him.
If he's smoking cigarettes and it,

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,100
it allows him to be more free and
creative inside the ring.

144
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,920
It's almost helping them because parents
were lime to be more creative.

145
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Maybe.
Maybe it calms his nerves.

146
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:32,150
He's been doing it for so long.
It's such a good choice for them.

147
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,940
So it's almost the same thing with Jon
Jones.

148
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,370
Man,
you can smoke a little weed and still be

149
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,140
world champion,
the baddest man on the planet.

150
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,320
We don't have to take all this winter.
You gotta wear dockers and act like

151
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,490
God's child.
You know what I'm saying?

152
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,540
I've seen people who have to be very,
very specific and correct and intense in

153
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:53,000
something a lot of times the way they
manage that stress,

154
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:56,720
the stress of competition,
the stress of living up to expectations

155
00:06:56,721 --> 00:07:00,320
is they have one vice.
They typically will give themselves a

156
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,690
recess.
Most smoking girls,

157
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,510
whatever it might be.
Human beings tend to do that more than

158
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,730
they don't.
Most athletes don't and I would say that

159
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,760
was my biggest problem was I had to.
Everything had to go.

160
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,890
It had to be mapped out to be written
out,

161
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,610
plan for plan minute by minute and if
anything went wrong I freaked out and I

162
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:20,090
always wish I was more of that maverick
Joe Schilling maybe have a cigarette,

163
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,670
maybe go crash a Bentley with hookers
and cocaine,

164
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,170
but don't you think that that's maybe
like the cigarettes aren't necessary.

165
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:31,520
It's the attitude behind the choice to
make cigarettes part of your life.

166
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,870
Correct.
That's what's necessary.

167
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,120
Like that was made though when he was
much younger.

168
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,040
Yeah,
but he doesn't have to continue that

169
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,010
pattern.
It's a very destructive lot.

170
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,260
Like I noticed now we've talked about
it.

171
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,160
Yeah,
and I know he's.

172
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,490
He's tried to stop me.
He's tried to stop when there is my

173
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,410
feeling.
If you try to stop something,

174
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,070
it means you want to stop something,
so if you try to stop and then you don't

175
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,960
stop,
that means it beat your ass.

176
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,350
Like that is an important part of your
life where you can,

177
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,750
when you can,
when you're in a competition with

178
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:03,470
yourself and you can win and you don't.
This is my feeling about this and I'm

179
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,600
not trying to be hard on people,
but I think this is an important

180
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,300
distinction.
When you fail yourself,

181
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,410
when you decide to yourself that you're
going to take care of something and

182
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,270
you're going to kick an addiction,
you're going to do something and you

183
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,080
don't do it.

184
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,950
You don't like yourself as much.
I guess one of the most important things

185
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:23,780
about accomplishments and about
overcoming bad things in your life.

186
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,260
If you have something you're doing like
smoking cigarettes and you don't kick

187
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:29,870
it,
you won't respect yourself the same.

188
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,090
The only thing,
the only thing I would say though is

189
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:37,091
that sometimes liking yourself isn't so
important for accomplishing great

190
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,720
things.
There are a lot of people that would is

191
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,150
for happiness.
Yes,

192
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,981
yes.
But you know,

193
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,530
sometimes happiness can be the great
stopper.

194
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,940
You know,
it's like Harriet door.

195
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,080
When she wanted the book award,
they said,

196
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,940
well,
are you happy being a housewife for 35

197
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:50,631
years?
And she said,

198
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,370
why would anybody was happy write a
book.

199
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,530
I'm not saying that you have to be
suffering,

200
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:55,950
but a lot of times

201
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,960
I don't know that being satisfied,
having peace of mind and and even being

202
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,180
happy,
which of course we all are striving for

203
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,490
sometimes that can be a hindrance to
what got you where you are in the first

204
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,140
place.
And I'm speaking primarily a lot of

205
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,340
them,
a lot of great books,

206
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,410
screenplays,
films made by smoke and and so,

207
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,890
so in that sense,
so,

208
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,540
but,
but when it comes to addiction,

209
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,540
one of the things that they've found
that way easier to deal with.

210
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,520
So a lot of people say,
well,

211
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,550
stop smoking because it'll kill you or
stop smoking because it makes no sense

212
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,840
or stopped throwing because you're not
disciplined.

213
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,260
That tends to not.
That might work for a short period of

214
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,730
time,
but people always go back to their set

215
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:39,510
point and what does work better.
I don't think you should say always

216
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:40,560
because a lot of people quit.

217
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,770
They do,
but what?

218
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,860
What?
What helps with quitting from what I

219
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:48,420
have read and what I've talked to and
even in my own experience is that you

220
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:53,421
have to start associating the act of
smoking or whatever your vice might be

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,510
with something negative and associating
and even feeling the difference.

222
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,140
It's.
I always say about people that want to

223
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,580
get in shape.
If you could feel.

224
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,070
If people are out of shape and eat a lot
and eat food,

225
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,800
if they could feel how much better they
they feel.

226
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,510
I'm just talking about the pleasure
principle.

227
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,270
They could feel what it's like to be in
shape.

228
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:15,540
I think they'd have a heart easier time
going over that road to get there.

229
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,330
There'll be like,
you won't realize how good you feel

230
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,140
smoke until,
I mean the withdrawals and it's gonna

231
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,260
take forever to get through that point.
So that's a hard point to argue and I

232
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,520
don't know,
I've obviously,

233
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,690
but some people who have smoked,
like Ari said to this day,

234
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,400
he quit years ago,
still think what he said.

235
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,780
He still gets an itch.
I,

236
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,540
you'll see people smoking and we'll go,
God,

237
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,310
it looks good.
Like it is a powerful,

238
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:41,220
powerful drug guy.
Like schilling can't kick it.

239
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,290
I agree.
I don't think he wants to bad enough,

240
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,510
but also with,
with this Kito Diet,

241
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,420
I stopped all sugar.
I can't walk by Mrs Fields.

242
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,490
Don't welcome me by Mrs. Fields that
will freak the fuck out.

243
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,390
So it's back now because for a while you
were saying you don't even,

244
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,350
you don't even crave it.
It's only if I go by Mrs. Fields like I

245
00:10:57,351 --> 00:11:00,150
was at the mall with my brother and I
was literally like,

246
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,620
Oh Dang son,
let me take my wall here.

247
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,180
Well,
you know,

248
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,340
it causes more of it if you go the
mentality of scarcity.

249
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,980
So if you start thinking this is the
last cookie on the planet,

250
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,843
you're going to go for it.

251
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,040
Oh,
it slows your metabolism down.

252
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,650
You know when you start going into
scarcity mode,

253
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:19,560
that's one of the things that they say
about people that were incorrectly

254
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,630
starving themselves.
Like you'll have like a little tiny

255
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:24,720
portions of carbs and you know,
and then your body's like,

256
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,470
what the fuck are you doing?
And your body slows down because it's

257
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,140
worried about losing resources because
no foods coming in.

258
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,120
They can actually,
yeah,

259
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,480
your metabolism slows down a hanging
onto this shit.

260
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,890
The only way like fasting is good is
when your body is in Ketosis because

261
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:44,580
then your body just starts burning fat.
The fucked up thing about addictions is

262
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,620
that this,
a evolutionary biologist,

263
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,190
his name escapes me,
was talking about how the fact that if

264
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,740
like an addictive mindset,
people who are extreme,

265
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,220
who,
who

266
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,020
need a lot of food for example,
or whatever,

267
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,220
that kind of mindset actually served our
ancestors,

268
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,370
cave men.
The idea of finding,

269
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,610
pinpointing what you want,
which is that deer and running after it

270
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,940
for three days until it falls over and
that,

271
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,760
that need,
that sort of left brain.

272
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,950
Yes.
Well it's the problem is when you take

273
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,060
away the fact that you have to chase the
deer for three,

274
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,200
three days,
you that,

275
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,500
that we still have a lot of that
reptilian sort of caveman mentality and

276
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:28,501
the most successful people in those
societies now will tend to be the same

277
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,110
people that have the same insane drive
to get,

278
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,780
you know,
do all the cocaine or eat all the food

279
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,400
or drink all the alcohol or,
or,

280
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,680
or the the,
or the addictive to,

281
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,580
to working out or to their sport.
And then those,

282
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,120
most times those,
those,

283
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
you know,
these people.

284
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,300
So to you,
those world,

285
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,270
those elite of the elite,
the one percenters,

286
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,570
they're not the funds to hang out with.
Some of them are not the guy like

287
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,430
Michael Jordan used to say that Michael
Jordan,

288
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:57,230
if you beat him playing ping pong,
he wouldn't talk to you for two weeks.

289
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,650
Right?
That's fucking be angry at you.

290
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:01,570
It was fun to hang out with.
Yeah,

291
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:06,250
and that's what produces that intense
level of focus that creates a guy like

292
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,500
Michael Jordan and they still don't like
themselves though.

293
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,500
There's a little bit of that in there,
but the question becomes,

294
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,590
do you want to be happy?
Do you want to be healthy or do you just

295
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,990
want to be successful?
Like do you want to be like some

296
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,540
miserable person?
It's laden with addictions that you may

297
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,260
or may not be managing,
but that is creating some success.

298
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,570
Like in the form of art,
like maybe music or something like that.

299
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,190
I think a lot of musicians,
there's.

300
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,240
There's an argument for that versus like
a bet nickelback eat a lot of Vegan

301
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,650
food.
Look man,

302
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,560
my told him
bring water.

303
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,570
I bet they get up early and do yoga so
much.

304
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,890
Shit.
They dropped some hips,

305
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,000
have some songs I enjoy here.
They have that one.

306
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,490
I see.
There's that one song that everybody has

307
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:49,700
song,
which was.

308
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,391
Listen.
No,

309
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:51,820
no,
no.

310
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,650
It's the theme.
The Rock Star Song.

311
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:56,140
Like I'm a rockstar.
Like there's like the fucking,

312
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,240
my favorite version of the Cypress Hill
version.

313
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,270
Yeah.
Your mind to be a rock star.

314
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,850
That's the shit,
right?

315
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,100
That's the best version of the back
superstars back's got.

316
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,870
They got their own version of it.
It's one of those are never good song.

317
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,800
Unfortunately.
I'd love to sample the sample up

318
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,070
broken nickelback song.
Here's.

319
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,560
There is.
But there's something that I think we

320
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:28,561
all recognize about what they did is
that there's just something sort of

321
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,330
disingenuous or something contrived or
something,

322
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,990
but it's still good.
Let me see.

323
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,400
Let me see if I think they're almost
fake.

324
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:40,234
You know,
like the.

325
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,530
Yeah,
and I can't be friends.

326
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:45,830
I think they're fake at all.
You know what I think Ben just to.

327
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,680
They're successful and I think a lot of
dumb people like them.

328
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,763
It's not that they're

329
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,690
good.
I think they are good.

330
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,710
I think that a lot you get associated
with some of your fans.

331
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:01,310
There's that and someone started picking
on them and using them as a punchline

332
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,510
and then it became that punch line.
Catches fire is like,

333
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,050
look at all the bad musical artists and
I say bad,

334
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,530
obviously tasted suggests subjective and
I'm just talking about my opinion,

335
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,070
which is my taste for me.
There's so much shit out there,

336
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,010
but people love it and it doesn't become
a punchline.

337
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,030
Like nickelback became a punchline for
white dude.

338
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,040
It's a little too good.
Michael had Fox fluxion Bolton was

339
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,390
talking about.
Michael was saying I became a punchline.

340
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,360
Michael Bolton was saying I was just
doing music and all of a sudden like the

341
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:38,060
right people started making fun of me
with the guy with the hair.

342
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,130
Yes.
And they said people started making fun

343
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,380
of me and I and it just caught fire and
I was like,

344
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,790
shit literally became.

345
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,640
I was just writing my music.
We had long hair and he had like a

346
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,980
turtleneck on a portion.
Your voice isn't bad voices.

347
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,640
There is some area.
Well,

348
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:54,090
my goodness,
my shit.

349
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:55,160
My man.
Michael,

350
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,560
you need a fucking mirror.
Ask Yourself,

351
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,090
what have you given these people?
He,

352
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,150
he's on the,
he's on the come up using those new

353
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,640
commercials towns and he was on the
lonely island video.

354
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,523
He's,
he's,

355
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,210
he's very talented,
but he's rocking normal here now.

356
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:10,640
Upper left upper left back.
Handsome guy.

357
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,720
Yeah,
that's someone's dad.

358
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,330
That's perfect.
A little too much makeup,

359
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,770
but in general,
short here,

360
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,760
he's got teenage daughters.
You got to go to his house and meet him.

361
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:22,790
He take his daughter to the prom.
That guy seems like a nice fella.

362
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,080
Hey,
does it fix the whole thing?

363
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,220
The hair thing was out of control.
It's almost like the back and the bottom

364
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,140
was to distract you from the top.

365
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,250
Who Do you think some weirdness going on
at the top was just like weirdly

366
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:35,540
cropped?
Just a hot.

367
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,820
Trust me.
There's a guy who tried to disguise

368
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,530
boldness before.
That's exactly what he's doing,

369
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,690
but that's what guys,
etc. But what happens to guys?

370
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,340
That's what happens guys with guys.
If a dude is decorating himself a little

371
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,770
too much,
if we all go,

372
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,150
hey man,
what's the guy?

373
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:52,820
The guy's got Bracelets.
Why is he wearing bangles and what's

374
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,110
what the tiara.
I can't.

375
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,170
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
You walk into this room and it's got too

376
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,600
many girls have american deerskin
outfits with the tassels and he's got a

377
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,960
bear,
a bear claw necklace out of my medicine

378
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:06,900
bag.
I get the fuck out.

379
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,970
Get the fuck.
He better be a shaman.

380
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,050
Carries throughout popery night.
He better be able to suits and a good

381
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,970
one.
How many bracelets can you have before

382
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:17,781
you were an asshole?
god,

383
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:21,230
that's a good question.
I have like a gang of those bracelets.

384
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,850
Unless you're fucking criss.
Angel.

385
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,740
Randy coture.
Chris.

386
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:25,760
Hey,
chris angel's?

387
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,350
Nope.
Hey randy.

388
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,880
Randy.
I love your broTher.

389
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,210
Is he wearing?
Is he wearing a scarf and a tank top?

390
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,300
You gotta.
Make up your mind.

391
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,360
What the fuck's going on randy?
what kind of weather are you expecting,

392
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:41,990
sir?
I don't know,

393
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:42,824
but I'm ready.

394
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,233
Hey,
you know what?

395
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,190
He gets away with it.
It's a fucking free pass for everything.

396
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,960
You can wear the bracelets.
You can wear a scarf.

397
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,720
He can do no wrong here.
What?

398
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,430
What happened that made him say,
I need this scarf.

399
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,920
Stylists.
Come on,

400
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,850
look,
he's got another scarf.

401
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,300
Stop for a second.
This is randy fucking kotex in America.

402
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,130
America with multiple time world
champion,

403
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:11,490
one of the toughest guys that's ever
walked the face of the planet earth.

404
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,890
You don't need a stylist.
hollywood got to and went.

405
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,060
You know what make you look better.
scarf.

406
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,350
He needs.
He needs us wearIng a fucking scarf.

407
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,910
He doesn't need a scarf.
I'm going to get that.

408
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,100
Know you would wear a scarf.
You son of a brandy,

409
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,080
whereas one.
So why can't I?

410
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,790
Holy shit.
Whites in so many scarves.

411
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,740
She likes scarfs.
The guy likes scarves.

412
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,450
Yeah,
he's.

413
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,860
I don't understand.
Maybe it's silly if someone fucks with

414
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,120
me.
It takes it off and kills him with it.

415
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,700
He just ready for a sandstorm.
Nikki chokes me.

416
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,461
Chokes.
But he thinks it'd be,

417
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:40,140
do.
She'd wear a black belt around his neck

418
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,090
everywhere he goes.
Legit,

419
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,180
legit point.
he came to 10th planet inbetween a

420
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,660
career.
Like when he,

421
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,670
before he came back and fought tim
silvia,

422
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,760
he came to 10th planet and he did,
um,

423
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,590
a grappling match with jacques rey.
Do you remember that?

424
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,420
He had a grappling match,
jacques rey rico pep rally,

425
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,500
who was one of the most important guys
in the early days of mma as far as

426
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:08,400
incorporating wrestling and submissions.
Rico was a huge,

427
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,020
like a asset to a lot of guys that were
just starting out and um,

428
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,580
and to this day has like,
has helped a lot of like mac danzig was

429
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:21,690
working with ricoh before he retired and
it was like his last few fights and was

430
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,490
like,
rico is a fucking genius.

431
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,450
he knows so much.
And he was like one of the early guys

432
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:30,500
that was like a rest where that was
tapping out black belts like he was.

433
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,540
He was like really,
really high level wrestler.

434
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,540
In fact,
he's in the Mark Schultz documentary.

435
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,710
Foxcatcher Mark Schultz wrestled him,
I'm pretty sure.

436
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:41,431
Yeah,
he went well.

437
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,660
A rico was a ncaa champion.
I believe he was an olympic alternate.

438
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:46,494
I'm not sure,
but I know,

439
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,430
I know it's super high level wrestler.
And then on top of that,

440
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:55,410
super knowledgeable about submissions
created a professional submission thing.

441
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,650
And so randy for jacques rey and this
professional submission thing,

442
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:02,580
and he's so strong shock or a tried to
lower leg lock them.

443
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,190
He had his leg,
he couldn't fucking straighten it out

444
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,010
rather than just doing like leg curls,
not straightening.

445
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,130
Captain America son got these grappler
string with hundreds of years of,

446
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,880
of squeezing things to 45.

447
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,980
Uh,
leo machida in toronto.

448
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,180
It's the week of the fight on their
parents for a ufc.

449
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,820
And uh,
I see randy in the hotel.

450
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,460
I've maybe met him once before.
He goes,

451
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,470
hey man,
you're a good striker.

452
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,710
I need you to help me tonight.
This is the night before the fight.

453
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,730
Like,
huh?

454
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,660
He goes,
I need you To help me.

455
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,780
Okay.
He had some gym book,

456
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,300
extreme tours in toronto.
We jump in hummers where they got them.

457
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:46,290
I have no idea drive to this location
far as hell.

458
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,560
I'm like,
what the hell am I going to do?

459
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,270
And so the night before the fight he's
doing round son.

460
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,650
You're not.
Most guys just do like,

461
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,840
you know,
he's already made weight,

462
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,190
you know,
most guys just kinda break their wind

463
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,450
and loosen up.
Oh,

464
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,550
not not captain America.
Oh no.

465
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,370
He had all his coaches there and his
striking coach,

466
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,980
some couldn't get into the country for
whatever reason.

467
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,830
So they all big broWn hair,
hold mitts for him.

468
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,630
I don't hold mitts.
I hit mitts.

469
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:12,460
I don't know if they know that I don't
fucking hold mitts,

470
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,300
but they're like,
we need your sound stand south pole and

471
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:19,210
every minute a new guy's going to rotate
in on randy for five rounds.

472
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,640
I was like,
the night before the fight between and

473
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,151
contouring,
I'm like,

474
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:22,521
fuck,
I'm,

475
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:25,900
I'm gonna do what is this case says?
So his coach would go on different guys.

476
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,930
we're going to be different situations
and I'm trying to hold mitts.

477
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,970
Mind you,
I've never,

478
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,760
I don't hold mitts.
I have to stay in south polk loading

479
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:34,150
machida.
Oh.

480
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,580
And randy isn't hitting them.
Like just feeling out.

481
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,820
This dude fucked me up.
I mean go hit me in the chin nose.

482
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,570
Bloody nose.
Pick me up,

483
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,700
slam me.
And I'm supposed to just let him do

484
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,534
whatever he wants.

485
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,380
This dude fucked me up every round like
god damn iT.

486
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,190
So he wants you to hit pads and then
shoot doubles and you know,

487
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,080
he's gonna shoot doubles on you and take
you down and hit you as well.

488
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,970
Yeah.
He was like doing this setup where he

489
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:58,750
would,
uh,

490
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,500
it was like a straight right left hook
and then get in on a single leg and I

491
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,460
was like,
god man,

492
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,030
you're,
you're,

493
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,730
when you come in and strike and I feel
like you're open for it because his

494
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,471
setup,
again,

495
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:09,170
I don't know,
random.

496
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,180
I didn't train them before that.
So I didn't feel like I was in the

497
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:15,550
position to say anything because I feel
like you're opening yourself up with

498
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,230
liotta man.
He's not going to be there.

499
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,520
LIke,
you're coming straight at him.

500
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,490
He's not going to be there.
I told his coach them,

501
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:21,190
I'm like,
no,

502
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,180
he got this,
you know,

503
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:22,750
he's been there before.

504
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,081
I was like,
yeah,

505
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:23,740
for sure.
Training,

506
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,080
couture,
pan,

507
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:30,081
watching the fight tooth.
He got knocked out like way to go shop.

508
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:33,430
You're the son of a bitch.
Jumping,

509
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:35,560
jumping front kick is what I meant.
I think it was.

510
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:36,610
Yeah,
that's exactly what it was.

511
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:39,100
I was in toronto.
That was the biggest event ever.

512
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,020
How about,
how about when Jack Wright did to a

513
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,720
vitara this weekend?
Damn.

514
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,070
Yeah,
he's a monster.

515
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,600
I don't think that was very surprising
though.

516
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,593
Oh,
well,

517
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,020
it's.
This is the vittorio you're looking at,

518
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,970
you know,
this tour that you're looking at right

519
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,510
now is with diminished hormone levels.
30 nine off,

520
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,610
which going to has legs look so skinny.
Ennis asked wasn't there and you can't.

521
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,150
You can't.
There's like there's only so much your

522
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:09,151
body can do if you're not supplementing
your hormones after a certain age and

523
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,340
when you see guys that fucked with
steroids most of their life and then

524
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,300
tried to operate off of them.

525
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,170
You have real problems.
Just kickstarting your endocrine system.

526
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,910
Stefan,
employee overeem,

527
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,700
testing.
what's up?

528
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,630
Well,
he's.

529
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,020
He's figured out a way to get down to
240 pounds.

530
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,270
He's younger a little bit.
Then first of all,

531
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,330
but he's figured out a way to get down
to 2:40 and maybe it doesn't have as

532
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:37,270
much power.
Who I think when he's realizing now is

533
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:41,940
technically like as a striker,
he has had a fucking very high level,

534
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,740
more technical than anyone use the same
mistakes.

535
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,160
He's made mistakes in some of his fights
and the mistakes in his approaches.

536
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,420
Mistakes in like how big he tried to be
or running out of gas.

537
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:56,660
Like in the travis brown fight.
When travis caught him with that front

538
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,670
kick to the face,
he would try to finish guys off and they

539
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,130
didn't finish that guys off.
He'd kind of be fucked and they'll land

540
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,690
on skills.

541
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,860
there's also with winkeljohn that that
fucking jackson team,

542
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:08,660
man,
there's a lot of great people for him to

543
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,210
train with.
He's really skills.

544
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,870
I'm just saying now that he's one of the
guys where you see drug testing kick in

545
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,640
and obviously he looks completely
different,

546
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,500
but now he has to adapt the way fight.
He has more skills in the heavyweight

547
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,000
division thAn anyone else.
When it comes striking.

548
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,700
It's not even close to grand prix.
He wanted the grant

549
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,550
technique is so fun to watch and he
donald,

550
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,650
we'll spar with them and says he just
learns.

551
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,500
Watching the guy,
but this is what I'm saying is he's a

552
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:39,170
guy where this strict drug tests testing
kicks in.

553
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,230
You can see a physical change and he's
still doing well.

554
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,880
He's better,
he's better in fights.

555
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:45,050
More cautiously.
Doesn't ask.

556
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,120
He's fighting really smart.
I'd say smarter,

557
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:47,750
not cautiously.

558
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,420
wastewater [inaudible] used to come in
like a meathead because he has so much

559
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:51,230
power.
Yeah,

560
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,440
exactly.
And that allowed him to get clipped and

561
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:56,340
I think that when you're seeing them
fight now,

562
00:24:56,341 --> 00:25:00,590
like especially perfect examples,
junior dos santos like he not junior dos

563
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:03,080
santos and a lot of people like god,
maybe juniors,

564
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
maybe he's done,
you know,

565
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,080
maybe it's just not the same anymore.
And then junior comes back and bites

566
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:09,470
brand ben rothwell it looks better than
he's ever looked.

567
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:11,450
Yep.
So junior looked fantastic and then you

568
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,320
realize,
oh,

569
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,680
overeem's a good.
He's good.

570
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,410
So explain to me why ground pre k one
champion.

571
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:22,030
It's just so much better.
She's the biggest of the big evolve.

572
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,800
Especially at the time when he did it.
It doesn't exist anymore,

573
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,390
but at the time when he wanted it was
badr hari gauguin saki.

574
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,100
The fucking stress in the world.

575
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,130
Best peter hertz.
These,

576
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,990
these guys like that one.
It the guys that are.

577
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,310
I mean he wanted it on a banner and
esther,

578
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:40,710
who was.
When you go back to like the,

579
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,850
the history of k one,
god damn andy hook someone who was the

580
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:47,450
greatest strikers of all time.
The most entertaining,

581
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,560
exciting,
wild,

582
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:52,700
crazy fights between the heavyweights
and they would knock each other out all

583
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,600
the time.
Sam.

584
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,553
Sam,
she'll.

585
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,870
I mean,
you got some monster.

586
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,370
Oh my god.
Send me shit.

587
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,340
Good luck trying to get in on that guy.
Seven feet tall.

588
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,390
Could it front kick the shit out of you?
How the fuck did he not play

589
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,830
professional basketball,
but dude,

590
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,530
he was such a good kickboxer wish.
I just wish there was more money in

591
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:13,910
kickbox especially back then.
Do you remember when keratan off took

592
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:16,010
him down at,
mounted him and just punched him in his

593
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:16,400
same.

594
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,380
I over and over again.
He was screaming.

595
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,390
You bet your sweet ass.
That was one of the most disturbing.

596
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,110
LIke finishes have a fight.
Keratan off.

597
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,630
took semi shell downer at the god on
top.

598
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,470
I'm karatani was a monster,
scared the shit out of him.

599
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,380
He was very scary because some russian
military dude and he,

600
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,410
he was beating semi shit.
Like he was torturing a prisoner.

601
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,780
Like I'm not even kidding man.
He like found a like uh,

602
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,620
he,
he,

603
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,990
he isolated him,
got up,

604
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,820
got on top of him,
pin him down and then kept hitting him

605
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:48,654
in his cut.
I,

606
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
he say though.
Yeah,

607
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,620
the same.
I just hitting the same and send me shit

608
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:55,980
was just screaming at one prisoner of
war stuff like you had some info that

609
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,540
fuck you.
Exactly what it needed.

610
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,580
It wasn't Good man.
It wasn't good.

611
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:00,900
There was something crazy about it.

612
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,440
It was like,
whoa.

613
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,980
You came into strikeforce and did work
to know that.

614
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,140
Well we thought arlovski was done after
he smushed orlowski member

615
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,470
murked all lawsky mean he's a k one.
Stryker is a beast to hold different

616
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,180
things.
I mean he's not the best of kate one.

617
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:20,220
You know,
he gets beat by the best guys in k one,

618
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,250
but he's at a super high level.
It's striking is no fucking joke for.

619
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,150
It was really good too because He,
he did a lot of box and had good

620
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:28,680
defense.
Beat the fuck out of over him,

621
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,500
beat the fuck out of my room,
knocked them outstanding.

622
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,110
So cracked him.
Had him running away from him,

623
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,440
running away from him and then he folds
against them and then when they fought

624
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:39,210
strikeforce,
they just never moved him over.

625
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah,
I guess not.

626
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,550
I wonder what happened.
I think he had some injuries for awhile

627
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:43,800
too.

628
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,420
I believe.
I believe he had some,

629
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,160
some issues and he gained a lot of
weight beCause of it.

630
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,550
remember he got like real heavy.
Yeah.

631
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,080
Because he lost in the heavyweight grand
prix.

632
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,030
That [inaudible] he was in that he lost.
What do you think is going to happen?

633
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,850
I won't say barnett.
Huh?

634
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,743
And barnett?
Beto.

635
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,350
Jimmy am I going crazy?
I remember that fight.

636
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,880
What do you think is going to happen
when steve pay fights over?

637
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,860
That's next one.
Hundred percent.

638
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,200
If you look at their scheduling to the
boat,

639
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,250
they both fall around the same time.
Overeem's next.

640
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,620
He's won four in a row.
He's the guy for the job.

641
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,170
they're both there.
I tHink you have to wait until travis

642
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:24,570
browne fights.
I'm cain velasquez,

643
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,820
I think when cain button,
but this is my thought.

644
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,420
Cain velasquez,
if he beats travis brown and some

645
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:33,090
spectacular way,
they're going to be calling for him to

646
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:33,810
fight for the title.

647
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:38,700
That's the toughest fight I think for me
only because travis will be in his grill

648
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,850
if it's for healthy travel,
if,

649
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,530
if cain is in shape and that cardio
thing and just in his grill boxing,

650
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,010
getting close and wrestling,
I hit the better east probably at least

651
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,210
as good a wrestler or a better wrestler
than state back.

652
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Cain is overwHelming as
fighters I suppose as a person who's

653
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:03,570
watched fighters my whole life,
like watching the ufc,

654
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:06,810
all the thousands of fights,
I'd never seen a heavyweight that can

655
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,770
put the kind of pressure on somebody
that came care.

656
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,910
He's just different.
His cardio is just different.

657
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,100
It's crazy.
It's like he's got double lungs.

658
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,120
I'm not even joking.
Maps.

659
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,290
I've been overwhelmed.
Watching his fights can be an argument.

660
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,030
He's number one best heavyweight of all
time.

661
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:22,560
He can.
I do argue that,

662
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,690
and you know,
people get mad at me,

663
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,460
they say fado is number one,
like,

664
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,960
nah,
maybe.

665
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,160
No,
I don't think so.

666
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:29,911
Look,
I don't,

667
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:33,210
I don't.
I really think that you have to be open

668
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:36,630
minded about this number one debate and
I think until silverdome just got

669
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:39,960
knocked out for dumas in the running for
the debate 100 percent.

670
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,160
I mean the system is in his prime

671
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,970
really submits minotauro and I don't
think fader wasn't as prime though.

672
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:47,780
That's why I disagree.
He was the first guy.

673
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,030
He was the first guy to do it when it
was faye door and then after that it was

674
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:56,290
a guy he did gain already,
but I think he was already on the slide.

675
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:01,430
He was sitting there was still that kind
of prestigious like app after he lost

676
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:02,540
that and it's like,
oh fuck it.

677
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,450
Coaches.
Coaches were saying that his view,

678
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,530
his own mma coach after he knocked out,
brett rogers said that fate or one with

679
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:15,580
his old tricks,
but he would have liked to have him for

680
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,250
more time training and he thinks he's
not.

681
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,450
He's not approaching it correctly and he
just won by being fatal,

682
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,830
but he also caught,
oh,

683
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,240
uh,
for dme with that old trick.

684
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,400
He caught him,
knocked him down,

685
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,700
and then the mistake of federal members,
he jumped into his guard,

686
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:33,850
but remember he jumped into pounder,
but he caught him really,

687
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:34,570
really well.

688
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,160
Knocked him down with the exact same
time that he did to everybody before

689
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:40,660
that.
So maybe,

690
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,930
or maybe verdugo goes down on purpose.
The moment a punch hits him so he could

691
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:49,610
drag you into which he does.
Yeah.

692
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,170
He's a smart guy.
He's a very smart guy.

693
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,040
Fight smarter than saturday.
Definitely did not face first because he

694
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,500
got tagged.
If you watch the stoppage,

695
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,030
if you see,
if you can find the highlights,

696
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,850
I'll show it to you because this is
something that I wish somebody brought

697
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:08,851
up during the actual commentary.
He got tagged right before he got

698
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,500
knocked out.
He got tagged on the same thing with the

699
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,060
right hand.
He moved forward.

700
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:14,620
He was making these advances.
He moved forward.

701
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:18,310
He got tagged with that right hand and I
think he was on queer street and I think

702
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:22,750
he went running at steep a on queer
street and got knocked the fuck out and

703
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:23,740
the way steep a did.

704
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,740
It was a fucking work of art.
The angle it was forest baby step to the

705
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:31,210
right.
It's better,

706
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,210
better.
His angle was sick and obviously his

707
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:39,211
right hand was nasty.
It's also volume did get hit early and

708
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:46,030
in training if you've seen him trained,
there's this competition within that.

709
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,230
Jim,
when you get hit it's like,

710
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,850
oh,
got to get them back more.

711
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,820
He gets hit and he was like,
go charging bull.

712
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:54,010
And was like,
fuck this man.

713
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,790
I think it's probably a little of both.
I agree because I definitely think both.

714
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,720
He got crack crack and I'm like,
well that is a big right hand that he

715
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:03,460
got hit with and it's in the same
manner.

716
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,260
The same enters charging for it.
He got hit.

717
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,780
That's how although got knocked out
against mcgregor.

718
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,640
Yeah,
you got to be fucking real careful

719
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:14,641
charging for
[inaudible] and steve bay's not got some

720
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:18,480
great guys,
but he's not a knockout artists per safe

721
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,340
compared to like a Mark Nelson.
He's not knockout artist.

722
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,850
When the guy's charging in like that and
then you're counting with right hand,

723
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,950
it makes it seem way worse.
Well,

724
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,310
here's my take on steve based power.
I think steve has big power,

725
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:33,010
but I think he fights economically and
intelligently.

726
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,260
He's a smooth fighter boxer.
He's a very good boxer,

727
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:40,040
a golden gloves boxer,
but he's like smooth and relaxed in the

728
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,960
way he spars.
It's one of the things that makes them

729
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:45,110
so dangerous because as he does things
very correctly,

730
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,460
you know,
and I think,

731
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,790
you know,
dc was on the commentary for the ufc

732
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,620
recently who was talking about getting
the rub.

733
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,750
You know,
he was talking about that experience.

734
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:55,790
When you have a tough fight with
someone,

735
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,340
you get the rub and he fought junior dos
santos and they went to war.

736
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,190
What do you mean rubbed the.
This is what I mean,

737
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,860
what he was saying.
He's like,

738
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,640
daniel says,
when you fight someone that's really

739
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,760
good and they're better than you,
even if you lose you,

740
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,670
it elevates you.
You get the rub,

741
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,530
but just by sharing the ring with them,
just by being in that,

742
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,920
by competing with them,
you realize how good you are to actually

743
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:18,110
get better and you realize how good that
person is.

744
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,420
Yeah.
I think he got the rub when he fought

745
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:24,110
junior dos santos in a way because he
went five rounds with a guy who was the

746
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:26,210
one of the toughest of the tough guy was
at one,

747
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,800
you know,
a champion and knocked out cain

748
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:31,760
velasquez was one punch and he went five
hard rounds with them and the decision

749
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,030
will,
could've went either way and,

750
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:34,340
and took his best shot.
Yeah,

751
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,940
and I also think that to go back to
[inaudible] point and your point with

752
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:41,120
the rub,
I think at the ufc level,

753
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,860
special wouldn't get in that top
echelon.

754
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,800
You know,
you're getting,

755
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,970
people are telling you you're good,
but like when he beat arloski,

756
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,140
you know,
starched them.

757
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,010
You don't learn much from that man.
When he go up to a decision with a world

758
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:54,530
class guy,
then you know like you're doing

759
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:55,880
something right,
your camp,

760
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,710
you're doing it right,
you had good gas,

761
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,690
you realize what works,
what does it,

762
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,000
so you've learned so much more and he's
going to,

763
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,700
like you said,
more with jds and we see them getting

764
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:05,750
better and better.

765
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,070
What's really interesting now is here's
the dark horse.

766
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,340
Nobody talks about stephan struve is
only 28 years old.

767
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,230
That fucking dude is gigantic.
He's seven feet tall and if he could put

768
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:20,800
it together and he put it together on
big foot silver the other night,

769
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,260
knocked him out.
I love the guy has a bunch of knockout

770
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,830
losses.
I know he does,

771
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,380
but he knocked out steepbank.
Struve not got steep and that was his

772
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,610
only loss than the ufc.
Yeah,

773
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,920
let's do,
do struve do not count that guy out.

774
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,950
Stripped at an inside leg kick and then
at least got that heart issue and stuff.

775
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,660
Well,
I don't know what he's got going on

776
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,820
physically,
but I'm saying that kid,

777
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,180
if he puts it all together when you're
seven feet tall,

778
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,930
how long does it take before you even
get coordinated?

779
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:50,270
RiGht?
I mean east like you're sending a

780
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:54,500
message and it's got to go so far before
it gets to your fucking hand.

781
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,670
And then,
I mean,

782
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,520
have you thought you guys are super tall
like jack man,

783
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:02,440
those guys?
I mean like the thing is,

784
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:06,140
is steep,
steep based struve would be such a

785
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:09,020
fricking handful of.
Could learn to use his reach,

786
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,460
but you guys like Roy Nelson.
When you get these upper echelon guys,

787
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,180
you know,
nothing gets big foot,

788
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,460
but off trt or whatever the case he
actually needs it offered.

789
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:22,040
It's I think anyone that top 20 kinda
fucked him up.

790
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,770
But with struve,
the real testament who they give them

791
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:26,330
that because that's true.
Got fucked up.

792
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:29,960
I overeem and overcome those toys.
Superintelligent fight the way father

793
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
took him down.
Beautiful.

794
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,580
Take down on top of him.
Just ground upon the show about

795
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,540
struve's.
You gotta realize that kid has I think

796
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,160
40 fights.
Yeah.

797
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,150
Here's a shitload of miles out.
Well,

798
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,420
his heart,
heart and the market.

799
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,520
What will have to design it?
No,

800
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,240
but it's.
I don't know what he's got.

801
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,670
What is the medical condition?
I forget.

802
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,010
We have the same manager,
so he deals with it all the time.

803
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,990
That Mark Hunt knockouts,
jesus christ.

804
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:54,510
Mark hunt with that leaching left hook.
Shattered his face.

805
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,840
Oh,
tude mark on it.

806
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:58,350
So fucking been caged.
Sad scene that.

807
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,440
Oh,
it's fast.

808
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,740
Too fast,
too steep a can get.

809
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,520
I,
I'm,

810
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,750
I'm curious to see if steve can get
within boxing distance of allister and

811
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,580
take away any of those kicks and how he
sets it up.

812
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,190
It was going to be interesting.
Alster combox man.

813
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,210
He can't.
Oh yeah,

814
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:16,310
for sure.
Better than.

815
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,140
I'm just going to tell you.
Knocked out junior with one punch.

816
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,150
That's good.
He's the best striker in the ufc

817
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,770
heavyweight division maybe of all time.
So.

818
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:26,604
So.
So steve.

819
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,400
Steve bay then is going to have to close
that distance and knocks him.

820
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,730
Not necessarily.
Steve bay could crack him.

821
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,090
Look,
ben rothwell knocked him out in the

822
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,470
first round.
Cep has better,

823
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,530
can happen,
and footwork and has been stopped a lot.

824
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,550
Chins the question.
ThIs is the thing people forget with

825
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:43,800
allister.
The motherfucking grapple.

826
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,140
Oh yeah.
In wrestling.

827
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:47,220
Grapple his ass off.
So you want to go to the ground with

828
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,360
them?
You're gonna be in a world of trouble.

829
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:51,130
Well,
he won the abu dhabi european trials and

830
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,370
in pride he submitted vituro.
He's got an.

831
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:56,090
He also submitted Mark Hunt.
He has a nasty good team.

832
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,933
Dude.
Zoos.

833
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,110
I always forget about just as a striker,
but you want to get to the ground.

834
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,420
I don't think steve bay has a lot of
submission.

835
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,560
Work under is so steep and I trained for
two years together.

836
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,020
That kid has submission defense.
So you know,

837
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,160
rashad is his black belt.

838
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,060
If you ask god to show you like a homo
plot or a real specific,

839
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,980
uh,
offensive move,

840
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,740
it's,
I don't think at that black belt level,

841
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,960
but his defense and that defense is nest
super nasty.

842
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,430
It's jUst what?
He's really good at.

843
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:28,710
Defense.
He's a very smart athlete,

844
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,190
you know,
and in good it's when you have a guy

845
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:34,530
who's like,
who could probably be a professional

846
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,730
ballplayer,
right?

847
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,010
You will see bay.
He could probably be a professional

848
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:38,970
ball.
He didn't make it.

849
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:39,900
Yeah,
he didn't make,

850
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,960
but he's at this level of an of an
athlete now.

851
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:46,830
What I'm saying is it's rare that you
see a guy like that who comes over to

852
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,100
mma and fights like super technical,
super smart,

853
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,590
who's also really,
really tough firefighter.

854
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,410
Yeah.
For professional,

855
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,230
full time head.
His head is the biggest head I've ever,

856
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,310
ever seen into large set.

857
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,170
Nicest guy.
He's a great guy,

858
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,470
but he's.
He's got a rare set of attributes,

859
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,650
meaning that he's at pro sports athlete
level,

860
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,530
like as far as like his,
his ability,

861
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:14,070
his movement and his intelligence and
his approach and his training and then

862
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:19,071
on top of that he's tough as fuck stuff
is tough as fuck.

863
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,390
Like in this fight.
Let me tell you something,

864
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:22,500
dude.
I wAtched this fight,

865
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:27,420
very careful and one of the things that
I was noticing was like how calm he was

866
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,110
through everything through the walk,
when they watched,

867
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:32,640
when they're staring each other down.
One of the things you Really pay

868
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:37,641
attention to is the shortness of the.
If you watch people breathing during

869
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,010
nervous situations,
a lot of times even if they look calm,

870
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,570
you could sort of see this uneasiness in
the way they're taking in oxygen.

871
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,890
You're sensing tension.

872
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,170
You don't see.
You don't sense any of that shit looking

873
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:50,441
at,
you know,

874
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:54,070
what's impressive to if he doesn't Come
from like a mastermind camp.

875
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,020
No,
it's just his boys and cleveland.

876
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:58,120
Well,
he just might have a mastermind can be.

877
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:00,610
There's a lot of masterminds out there
that don't have the right pupil.

878
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,940
I'm saying He's not from like a
jackson's ha att.

879
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:08,941
He kicks his shit within cleveland and
does work and then goes and saves people

880
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,350
from burning buildings.
Who else is in that?

881
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,720
Um,
that camp is the guard style.

882
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:14,970
Mma.
There's also the.

883
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:17,620
Isn't there a leslie smith from there?
No,

884
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,180
it's not raquel pennington.
Right?

885
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,240
JessiCa?
I know.

886
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,790
It's just guy jessica,
jessica,

887
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,790
um,
so they have tough fighters.

888
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:28,840
it's just like if A guy's like a really
skillful trainer and you know,

889
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:30,340
you've only been doing it for a few
years,

890
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,160
you have to wait for the right guy to
sort of walk through your door.

891
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,440
Then walking through the door with eddie
bravo with eddie bravo.

892
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:43,200
Took forever for him to find someone who
could do his style and,

893
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,120
and prove in competition that it's very
effective.

894
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:50,020
Not just with him.
He had a unique style or his brother or

895
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,820
dad.
The guy with the mustache and I look at

896
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,860
that guy with a mustache guys.
Awesome though.

897
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,040
But you talked about steep ap column.
Remember he's finding right now.

898
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,390
That guy's not that old.
Brian.

899
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:01,600
Why are you calling that guy?
His dad aNd his older brother,

900
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,820
his older brother.
I guarantee it.

901
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,570
Just some fucking thick dude.
You know,

902
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,610
eddie bravo had a real good point about
this.

903
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:10,990
We were talking about it on the phone.
He was like,

904
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,270
fabrizio looked too relaxed.
He like,

905
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:14,650
he was coming up to the,
to the ring.

906
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,360
He was making that face that he may say,
yeah,

907
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,700
so sick of that face.

908
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,150
Oh,
he's being funny.

909
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,610
It's being silly.
I don't think theRe's anything wrong

910
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,250
with a fighter trying to stay loose.
I don't at all.

911
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,880
I think that's one of the things that
fabrizio does to have a good time.

912
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:30,220
He likes to make that sale.
He's also been doing it forever.

913
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,040
He's the man he's supposed for over to
him.

914
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,730
If he won the fight and made that face
number one,

915
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,780
say a fucking word.
If he went out theRe and head kicked,

916
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,090
steep meo chick,
you know,

917
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,790
no one would say a word,
but it didn't work out.

918
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:45,790
So when It doesn't work out,
that's when everybody comes shitting on

919
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:46,624
you.
It's the same.

920
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,760
The same with connor.
Connor.

921
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,290
Connor is walking out like rousy.
Same with rhonda.

922
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,590
When ronda lost everybody's mad at all
the shit that they loved her,

923
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,810
they loved her for,
don't be a do nothing,

924
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:00,280
bitch and fuck you.

925
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,390
I'm,
I'm making it to the top.

926
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:03,160
Kiss my ass.
Or they hate them.

927
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,630
They now they think she's arrogant.
Same with content.

928
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,030
If oh shit,
he's in venice right now,

929
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,550
driving around a royals royce just
wiling out.

930
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,670
Look,
I just,

931
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,060
you know,
it's just what comes.

932
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:19,840
It's part of what people love about
people bragging or they want to bring

933
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:20,674
you down though,
man.

934
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,750
No matter how I look how loose steep it
looks because loose.

935
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,350
I mean he's fighting for the title nice
and loose,

936
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:30,070
so he moves away keeping the argued.
He should have got titled earlier too,

937
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,660
but he's like,
he's just such a nice guy and a lot of

938
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,010
checking to.
Lot of good checking of kicks.

939
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,530
Her kids more ties,
very good luck,

940
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,010
very educated with his movements and
look for breezy has got some fucking

941
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:45,140
nasty kicks man.
And he's like right there.

942
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,890
His striking is much improved.
We saw in the travis brown fight,

943
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:52,740
man over dangerous on the statement,
the last fight,

944
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,340
dude,
his striking is fucking legit.

945
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,910
He's long as shit and he's got
confidence in it.

946
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,440
That nice switch kick their butt.
He's a beast.

947
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,800
I think in order to be that dangerous of
a fighter,

948
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,840
you're going to have to open yourself up
a little bit.

949
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,610
Then when he fight a real strategic guy
like steep a year,

950
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,010
didn't get a little bit of trouble.
Well,

951
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:14,060
I think what happened in this fight in
particular is that he forced it.

952
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:14,910
Yes.
Thank.

953
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,550
He was in this gigantic soccer arena.
It's the biggest crowd in history and

954
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:22,030
mma in Brazil.
Look at that beautiful leg kick though.

955
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,470
Yeah.
The inside the chat doesn't have that.

956
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,200
Yeah.
It's all nice.

957
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,860
Like the technique is real nice,
but I think for breesa was just so

958
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:34,460
ramped up because there's all these
people in Brazil and I think he's a

959
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:35,120
confident man.

960
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,310
I think he thinks he's the fucking best
in the world.

961
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,660
He just has to get ahold of this dude.
There's a right hand.

962
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:40,540
He nailed right.
Right.

963
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,040
See,
so now we can take a shot tab.

964
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,240
But now.
But now look,

965
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:46,610
he's forcing it.
Forcing it because he landed at.

966
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,630
Yeah.
So watch.

967
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,650
When he starts to force it,
he gets hit real hard and then he gets

968
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:54,110
hit hard and knocked out.
He tried that knee,

969
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,180
tries forward and when sees he got a
terrible single attempt there.

970
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:01,190
That was like such a.
You're like getting steeper on that.

971
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:03,890
He was also,
I mean he might've been just trying to

972
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:08,540
make them work.
Maybe open up possibilities can drop in

973
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,590
his mind,
right,

974
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,330
and range.
So he's not afraid to just be right in

975
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:13,400
their grills.
Not toby,

976
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:16,700
he's not writing range,
but he's real relaxed.

977
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:18,190
Like even the waste throwing that tap,
tap,

978
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:18,681
tap,
tap,

979
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:18,890
tap.

980
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,440
Now like he's economical and when your
economical and a five round fight,

981
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:25,730
it's super difficult chat.
I was a very nice lady by fabrizio.

982
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,040
These timing,
that jabin great inside.

983
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Located in the jab also is super light.
Like he's just floating it out there.

984
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:34,970
Pop.
There's nice lock.

985
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,530
Step 20 jeff,
so he steps to the,

986
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,530
to the side there like that.
Like look at that jacket,

987
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,480
like that is to,
you know,

988
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:43,820
he's not just no tension there.
You know what I'm saying?

989
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,550
LIke it's like flowing.
They check that link again.

990
00:43:46,551 --> 00:43:47,650
Nice leg kick by.
Steep.

991
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,800
A nice switch.

992
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,350
So right now for me was realizing like
okay,

993
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:57,810
this is an easy
part.

994
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,570
That's the one you're reading right
here.

995
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,750
Bang.
That's the chaos.

996
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,490
Now back it up again.
Watch.

997
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,900
Just just back it up just a little bit
to where it's chasing them.

998
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,110
So watching these chance he got rocky.
Ideal player is really

999
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,650
your problem.
You're right.

1000
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,980
I saw that correct though,
joe.

1001
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,340
I didn't see that until.
And he got mad and he came out.

1002
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:17,180
Yes,
yes.

1003
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:18,210
He got his tag.
Yeah.

1004
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,600
He got tagged hard with that right hand.
That's right.

1005
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,840
And then he kept charging and then he
got face planted with the second one

1006
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,910
that,
that first right hand had him on queer

1007
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:27,800
street.
I guarantee you because he's moving

1008
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:31,230
forward and steep aid drops it in on
them and it's the same punch he knocked

1009
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:34,320
him out with and when,
when steve bay throws a punch and this

1010
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,330
is how,
you know he's good at me,

1011
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,870
obviously it was fucking good,
but this is how you,

1012
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,890
you know,
techniques at a real high level.

1013
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,070
His arm is like loose and then he throws
it and then as it gets to his face he

1014
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:52,550
tightens it down and does this stack
like as he's moving away he's like,

1015
00:44:52,681 --> 00:44:57,681
it's a super efficient,
like really technical punch to the

1016
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:01,320
throat that way.
Moving back back in that sense,

1017
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:03,540
it's very much like what anderson did to
forrest griffin.

1018
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:07,080
It's also calculated because he threw it
twice and they both land in there,

1019
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,490
but you can tell they're working on it.
He threw,

1020
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,650
he threw the.
The left hook twice to check,

1021
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:13,921
right?
Yeah.

1022
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:17,310
Moving back,
moving back to the side when he does

1023
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:22,290
that or if it doesn't even necessarily
have to be that he planned it out and

1024
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,780
that was a part of the game plan.
I think steve bay does that.

1025
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,140
I think he's a really good striker.
If you look at his Movie and I think

1026
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,920
you're looking at a guy who's super
fucking determined,

1027
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:34,740
man,
steve bay is super determined and when

1028
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:38,490
you're a guy that's that focused,
you're going to get fucking really good

1029
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:39,324
at everything.

1030
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,250
So after he gets that fight,
that jab,

1031
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:42,790
jab,
so flu,

1032
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,760
it's like an upper country and it is
too.

1033
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,510
It's so like everything he's doing is so
relaxed and efficient.

1034
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,810
You don't see a lot of jabs in february.
Can see a lot of jabs,

1035
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,030
like my all time favorite fighter.
Probably.

1036
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,070
If I were to tell you who I was most
excited to see,

1037
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,640
fight is probably vandelay.
Boom.

1038
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,140
See that right hand.
He's russian is fucking hurt here.

1039
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,003
Yeah,
he got mad.

1040
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,860
He didn't just get mad.
His legs jolted.

1041
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:08,670
He had like you could see his legs
stiffen up When he got hit by that first

1042
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:11,560
right hand.
He got hurt and then the second one face

1043
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,930
plant some steep.
Pays a dangerous guy.

1044
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,220
He's not going to make mistakes.
They cleveland.

1045
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,320
Let's get our boy a goddamn parade.
No one.

1046
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:20,490
When shit.
No shit.

1047
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,420
Hey lebron.

1048
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,180
You want a jacket?
The other ufc fighters.

1049
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,030
How would you tweet out about steeping
your boys from your fucking hometown?

1050
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,260
He jumped off the fence.
He goes,

1051
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,380
I'm the world champ.
I'm new world champs.

1052
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,231
Yeah.
Man was like,

1053
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:33,620
it was like coming into his.
His,

1054
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,890
his,
his mind like,

1055
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:36,690
is this real information?
Hey,

1056
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:39,720
lebron.
Did that just fucking game of fucking.

1057
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:40,560
Yeah.
I love it.

1058
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,840
I love that man.
I love him.

1059
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,930
I love what he stands for.
I love watching them as a fighter.

1060
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,330
I love that he could do that.
I love it.

1061
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,860
I love that.
He did it in Brazil.

1062
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:51,360
Look at this.
you to watch this.

1063
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,730
Watch how fish.
See it's like tank.

1064
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,610
Oh yeah.
He just drops it in,

1065
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:56,980
um,
to,

1066
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,280
to be able to time it that good to look
at this.

1067
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,390
Watch the timing.
Timing.

1068
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,670
He pushes his hand away and then put the
same hand.

1069
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,180
Did you see overeem?
Overeem's tWeet.

1070
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,540
Crack.
Yeah.

1071
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:10,710
Yeah.
He wants to fight him.

1072
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,570
He said you're next.
And he did the blood sport meme.

1073
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,060
See that?
That one showed both that.

1074
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,710
That would.
That highlight right there was the

1075
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,210
perfect highlight to the right because
it showed the first one.

1076
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,510
How much impact the first one had on
him.

1077
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,270
The first punch was a big factor there,
man.

1078
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,490
That first punch had him weird up.
Unbelievable

1079
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,230
man.
So cool.

1080
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,090
I'd like to.
You could still say queer street and

1081
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:35,830
you're not a homo queer streets.
fun.

1082
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,610
It's queer.
It's just strange.

1083
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,480
You know,
like what,

1084
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,760
where am I at?
The heavyweight division's fun right

1085
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:43,151
now,
man,

1086
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,250
because I don't think we're gonna see a
champ.

1087
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:47,530
Rain for a long time.
I want to make a shirt that says fight

1088
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,620
for queer street.
Oh,

1089
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:49,870
well,
how about,

1090
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,910
hey,
how about queer street fight club

1091
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,750
thing that's sending out the wrong
message?

1092
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,680
Might be,
it's like a bat signal for dick talking

1093
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,780
about
queer street.

1094
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,700
You'll learn how to throw a right hand
and fuck guys.

1095
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,890
Come guys.
Let's take a second break.

1096
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,350
I put up a picture the other day on
twitter of the oak ridge boys.

1097
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:19,230
Somebody sent me a picture because it
looks like us exactly like you.

1098
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,980
It really does.
One of them looks like you and me had a

1099
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,350
baby,
but one of the things that I was

1100
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:24,490
shocked,
I was like,

1101
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,970
someone said this is this looks like you
encountered,

1102
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,150
but I go,
oh my god,

1103
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:30,590
how gay with the oak ridge boys killed
me.

1104
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:31,750
Wait,
wait,

1105
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,220
when did you see this picture?
You're going to go.

1106
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,330
Well,
that's not real.

1107
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,290
No,
that's real.

1108
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,450
This is the actual album cover.
They took a photo shoot for this shit.

1109
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:41,530
Holy shit.
And then there was hilarious.

1110
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,090
You're allowed to feather your hair back
then.

1111
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,150
Yeah.
Like check the orleans orleans mercedes,

1112
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,670
orleans.
This is important because someone said

1113
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:54,850
to me after I posted the picture of the
old oak ridge boys,

1114
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,130
they said they didn't have nothing on
orleans and they put that up and I was

1115
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,970
like,
how about homeboy on the right and the

1116
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,740
the,
the beer cup on the far left

1117
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,900
waking dream and look at this guy
looking down at the other guy's dick.

1118
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,940
Literally actually looking down at this
guy's

1119
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,190
crazy.
I don't think orleans is doing a show

1120
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:18,340
than fucking each other like each other
during the show.

1121
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:20,890
You just don't notice it.
You don't notice it because there are so

1122
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:21,960
gay.
You blind.

1123
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,910
They wash your hair.
Look at this.

1124
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:30,010
This is the far right is calvin and me
had a kid and the kid likes mustaches.

1125
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,630
Guys.
Fucking.

1126
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,930
Why does he have panty hose around his
neck?

1127
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,930
What kInd of clothing is that around?
No,

1128
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,910
that's a straight tie.
That's a straight tie.

1129
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:46,240
Don't think it's a tight look.
It's got a task lead with a pink shirt.

1130
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,103
You're right.
Damn it.

1131
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,660
See seal.
The task lead is to randy coture

1132
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,210
stylists tour.
Same style

1133
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,960
of randy couture stylists.
They have that little star on the right

1134
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:01,880
because that dude at a boner that's
poking out over the top,

1135
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,990
his jeans from high chain,
those are high crocs.

1136
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,950
It was like a little broomstick
guys.

1137
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,970
The guy that looks like me on the end
here has really arching his back.

1138
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,120
He's having a good time and the two guys
in the middle of one of them is the

1139
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:20,230
magician.
The other one is a nature guy.

1140
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,010
Damn right.
One looked like a black jack dealer.

1141
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:29,030
The second guy or the far left guy looks
like a guy dies and some sort of crazy

1142
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:30,980
orgy where everybody does too much.

1143
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,890
Molly these days,
just having fun back then making music

1144
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:38,891
and sucking dick and I'm not and we're
In shrimp colored shirt jack.

1145
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,950
Everyone is so tight these days.
I know,

1146
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,080
right?
No fun anymore.

1147
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,610
Orleans at anymore.
Could you imagine you have today in

1148
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,910
today's climate?
A guy,

1149
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,870
but I would've thought that that climate
back then was less tolerant,

1150
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,020
super tall as it was back then.
Something,

1151
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:59,210
a national debate going on on whether or
not women should have to go into the

1152
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:03,260
same restroom as transgender people.
That's a national debate.

1153
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,890
Who would've ever thought that it would
be this country be so concerned with

1154
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:10,100
hurting people's feelings that that
would be a big part of the national

1155
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:13,130
debate part,
but if a band went out and did that,

1156
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,320
we'd be like,
get the fuck out of here with that gay

1157
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:16,610
shit.
It's true.

1158
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:21,380
I would repost tHe obama at the federal
government now asking public schools.

1159
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,040
They get public funds to create a
separate bath while.

1160
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,160
Okay,
what's going on?

1161
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,170
What's going on?
Is this just the internet?

1162
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,720
Is it the pressure of of groups on the
internet?

1163
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:32,600
Like what is it about?
I think like anything else for the first

1164
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:34,790
time,
the transgender community has a voice

1165
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,860
for the first time.
Anytime you have that,

1166
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,580
you're going to be.
You're going to have people that get

1167
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:42,020
very,
very loud and they're.

1168
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,050
This is their chance.
This is their moment to say,

1169
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:46,550
hey,
we're here.

1170
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,080
We've been in the closet forever and
you're probably going to have the louder

1171
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:56,081
voices in that community and even the
ones that are more extreme drive the

1172
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:58,670
debate.
The problem is that,

1173
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,160
you know,
there are concerns for all of us.

1174
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:04,820
For example,
if you identify with a different sex,

1175
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:07,430
if it's really the civil rights act was
all about sex,

1176
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:07,940
right?

1177
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,500
But now you're talking about,
now you're talking about discrimination

1178
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:17,501
based on How I perceive myself so I can
be a man and if I put a wig on,

1179
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,050
um,
but I say I'm a woman,

1180
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,760
I'm identifying with that gender by
federal law,

1181
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:30,790
am I then allow to go into a woman's
bathroom that it becomes difficult.

1182
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:34,880
The problem I have b is like I have to
be cool with everything.

1183
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,890
It might be a little weird to me if,
uh,

1184
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,310
you know,
there's a dude in a dress I'm not used

1185
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:41,110
to,
that I didn't grow up.

1186
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:45,500
And you're allowed to caItlyn jenner's
on the front of vanity fair or how about

1187
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:48,140
caitlyn jenner now saying I might want
to go back to bruce.

1188
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,250
Do you hear that?
No.

1189
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,760
Yeah.
So,

1190
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,230
so I know you hate that shit joe,
but I'm just saying to me it's a little

1191
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:56,780
weird that she's on the front cover of
sports illustrated.

1192
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,371
I'm like,
dude,

1193
00:52:57,371 --> 00:53:01,040
I used to be fucking bruce and then I
can hold a homophobe or something like

1194
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,640
that because to me it's a little strange
and I can't have questions sums up.

1195
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,100
I can't be,
you can't force me to accept you're

1196
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:07,910
right.
But just,

1197
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,340
if this is the way to look at it,
in my opinion,

1198
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:11,990
you know,
we,

1199
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:14,480
uh,
we have a lot of different minorities.

1200
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:18,200
Let's just take transgender.
There are sexual minority forever.

1201
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:21,500
they have been relegated to the,
you know,

1202
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,410
the shadows.
You had to keep it a secret.

1203
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,980
Uh,
you felt different,

1204
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,630
etc. Etc.
We know the stories.

1205
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,320
Um,
what makes a country strong and great is

1206
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:34,350
the fact that in this country is great
and the difference between this country

1207
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:38,670
and say Russia is Russia has one idea of
what strength is and that is the biggest

1208
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:40,470
muscles and the biggest guns.

1209
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,960
And the United States has that too.
But remember,

1210
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:47,670
what makes this countrY strong and
interesting as a culture is the fact

1211
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:52,560
that we create a safe haven for people
who think and act differently.

1212
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:56,970
That's where you get people like marilyn
manson and prince and great artists.

1213
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:01,620
So the debate becomes how do you make
those people feel safe without,

1214
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,340
without creating major inconvenience
for,

1215
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,251
you know,
the,

1216
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:09,570
the vast majority of the who say we may
not have the funds for a third bath.

1217
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:12,930
I now you're talking about all an entire
different infrastructure.

1218
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:16,830
So how do we work the funds to set up a
electric centers for teslas?

1219
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,600
Well,
fuck You.

1220
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,730
I,
I,

1221
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,720
it's,
it's a good debate to have.

1222
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:24,870
I don't know what the answer was.
I meant to talk to you about the show

1223
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:27,900
about this.
I found the mr han's video.

1224
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,640
Well,
let's get back to this because I think

1225
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,690
we're done with this.
Um,

1226
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,310
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1227
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,920
Look,
I definitely think that there is a

1228
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:40,921
spectrum of transgender people and I
think there's people that you wouldn't

1229
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:45,130
even notice.
And then there's people that look a lot

1230
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:50,131
like men and one identify with women and
people are going to be scared of that

1231
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,710
and there's gonna be weirdness of
involved with that because not because

1232
00:54:53,711 --> 00:54:55,390
of the transgender people might be
creepy,

1233
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,560
but because we know that there are men
that are predators that are not

1234
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:02,430
transgender men that are straight.
THat's what I care about.

1235
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:06,220
And if you give them the opportunity to
wear a dress and go into the women's

1236
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:10,360
room and just say they identify with
being a woman one what they wanted on

1237
00:55:10,361 --> 00:55:13,630
North Carolina.
And this is where it gets interesting is

1238
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,300
you had to it.
It's not that you had to be a

1239
00:55:16,301 --> 00:55:19,000
transgender person that please someone.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

1240
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:19,960
because I don't think I am.

1241
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,870
It's not that you couldn't go in the
bathroom.

1242
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:26,320
If you're a transgender person,
it's you have to go into the bathroom

1243
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,260
that matches the gender on your birth
certificate.

1244
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,380
Okay.
If you're born a Woman,

1245
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:36,280
but you want to be a man,
you can get that changed on your birth

1246
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:38,400
certificate.
I didn't know that can.

1247
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,820
Yeah.
Apparently you can.

1248
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,870
Did it so if they do that,
if they get it changed on the,

1249
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,410
I don't know how they could change on
your birth certificate 60 years later,

1250
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,263
like they do it.
Well,

1251
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,850
here's the problem.
We're now we're in this weird semantics

1252
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:55,060
thing where it's.
We're not talking about like technical,

1253
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,620
like what,
how,

1254
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:59,350
how fluid is gender.
I mean we're in.

1255
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,330
We need to really define this before you
just allow someone to wear a dress.

1256
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,030
How someone identifies and it's a very
different.

1257
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,960
It's a very different area than the
legislation that exists.

1258
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,230
It's cloudy because now you're talking
about you're not talking about male,

1259
00:56:16,231 --> 00:56:17,790
female.
You're not saying,

1260
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,570
hey,
if you are in the pension plan in this

1261
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:24,190
company,
because women live say 15

1262
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,670
years longer or whatever it might be,
you have to pay more into that pension

1263
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:28,600
plan.
As an example.

1264
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:31,360
That was unconstitutional because it was
sex discrimination.

1265
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:36,361
Now these laws are concerned with how
someone identifies.

1266
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,390
It's very murky,
so you may have a penis,

1267
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:44,020
but you identify as a woman and you're
taking hormones.

1268
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,520
Now we're in a very,
very good.

1269
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,650
Here's the brain,
have to be taking hormones.

1270
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,260
That's right,
that's just identify with being a woman

1271
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:52,900
to not want to do anything different
than what you are right now and then go

1272
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:55,750
into women's rooms like exception though
joe,

1273
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:57,910
like there's plenty of exceptions.
Well,

1274
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,670
because if you can say,
ah,

1275
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,960
well guys,
you gonna put on dress and just to go

1276
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,100
look at little girls something,
but when.

1277
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:06,220
That'd be the exception overall perhaps.
Yes,

1278
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:07,143
for sure.
Well,

1279
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,610
how many transgender people using
bathrooms,

1280
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,290
that's the exception.

1281
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,990
That's a huge.
Except with the exception to that is

1282
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:16,960
that they're going to go in there just
to look at little girls or molest little

1283
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:17,830
boys.
You're right,

1284
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:20,860
but if it's one out of 100,
it's something we should talk about you.

1285
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:22,210
If it's one out of a can tell you about
it,

1286
00:57:22,211 --> 00:57:25,330
but you can't make a decision based on
the accepted but you have to figure out

1287
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:28,990
what it is like.
That's where it gets almost impossible.

1288
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,860
You get.
It's really hard to protect women and

1289
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:37,660
children from creepy dudes like,
and this is not a slight on transgenders

1290
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:40,270
at all.
This is talking about transgender.

1291
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:43,210
We're talking about men who are talking
about taking advantage of take advantage

1292
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:44,044
of a law.
That's right.

1293
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:49,030
This has nothing to do with transgenders
giving any possible loophole where a

1294
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:54,031
piece of shit creepy male predator is
allowed to use a bathroom with a 10 year

1295
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,810
old girl and under the sanction of the
law.

1296
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,070
Yes,
under the sanctions of the law.

1297
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,660
I don't know about all that.
I'm not cool with it because when my

1298
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,980
daughter steven crowder,
but it's not.

1299
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,510
When you're making a law for the
exception,

1300
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:07,510
the first place to make a law that says
that transgender people can use a

1301
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:10,120
woman's room is is an exception.
Okay.

1302
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,910
Because you are making a law about a
very rare thing.

1303
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:17,380
A rare thing that when you look at the
entire internet and 7 billion people,

1304
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,420
you see millions of examples of it,
so you go,

1305
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:21,430
well,
transgender community is strong.

1306
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,190
We should recognize that they're being
discriminated against and that's all

1307
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:25,710
good and I think we all believe that,
right?

1308
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,920
We for sure,
but that is a rare thing to make a law

1309
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:33,540
for when you're dealing with how many
women have to use that restaurant.

1310
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,050
So do you think.
Hold on a second.

1311
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,700
How many women have to use that
restroom,

1312
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:38,200
but wow,
how many,

1313
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,600
how many transgenders want to use that
restroom?

1314
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:43,300
Like what are the.
What is the actual numbers that we're

1315
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:46,840
looking at before we start talking about
this and having this goddamn national

1316
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:50,650
debate training new bathrooms created.
Well that might be the only way,

1317
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:54,010
but what are the fucking numbers?
Can we just get some data on the

1318
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,360
numbers?
Is there any actual numbers?

1319
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,900
It must be.
So then how many men are sexual

1320
00:58:58,901 --> 00:58:59,591
predators?
Well,

1321
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:01,210
that's where it gets really fucking
easy.

1322
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,090
All you have to do is go to those sexual
predator apps on your iphone.

1323
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,210
Everywhere you fucking look.
There's sexual predators now.

1324
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,200
It could be a lot of different things.
I know a dude who be got labeled a

1325
00:59:12,201 --> 00:59:15,280
sexual predator because he got caught
taking a piss outside.

1326
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,370
He went outside,
exposes dick stepped outside of a bar

1327
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:19,180
and pissed.

1328
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,290
And because of that,
it is ridiculous,

1329
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:25,010
but it's one of those backwoods country
fuck states and it wasn't like the 19

1330
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:27,890
eighties or something like that.
And this guy got arrested,

1331
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,560
took a piss off a porsche,
don't,

1332
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,490
don't piss around a playground.
It's not,

1333
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,940
not just one guy that's happened to.
This happened to a bunch of guys,

1334
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,140
especially if you expose yourself
anywhere near a school or something.

1335
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:39,970
This round elements,
sexual,

1336
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,750
sexual predator.
So there's a lot of what we mean by

1337
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:47,960
sexual predator problem is how do you
define.

1338
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,810
How do you define what a guy said?
Look,

1339
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:54,110
there's an artIcle that I read the other
day about a guy with a beard.

1340
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,780
He has a full beard,
but he identifies as a woman.

1341
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:59,090
He wants to be able to use women's rooms
and he doesn't,

1342
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,950
he doesn't take hormones,
but he is a woman.

1343
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,630
He feels like he's a woman and he wants
to go.

1344
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:04,670
He doesn't want to have surgery,
but he identifies.

1345
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:05,401
can't have that.
So.

1346
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:06,500
So.
So here's how I feel.

1347
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:07,334
My daughterS.
Hey,

1348
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,320
how about that?
I'll tell you,

1349
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,570
my daughter's eight.
The other day I had a center into a

1350
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:15,260
public bathroom at the movie theater.
I assume when I send my eight year old

1351
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,980
into into a woman's bathroom that she's
going to be safe because it's going to

1352
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:20,570
be little girls and women.
I.

1353
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:24,500
If I say if there's a dude in there with
a beard who says he identifies as a

1354
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:27,050
woman,
I'm not letting my daughter go in that

1355
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:31,040
bathroom until that guy's out of there
and you know why I don't know who that

1356
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:34,490
dude is and he might say he's a.
He identifies as a woman.

1357
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:39,170
He might be fuCking crazy too.
There's also that possibility,

1358
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,600
but he's not getting near my daughter
and my whoop your ass.

1359
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,670
Yeah.
I also don't trust him.

1360
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,920
We'll call it big bearded dude,
man.

1361
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,140
I can't say that.
And you,

1362
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:51,230
you know when someone will say that's a
woman and you should say she's a woman.

1363
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,280
No,
I would say that's a mega.

1364
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,830
Okay,
so when do we draw the line?

1365
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:56,090
Man?
When we draw the line,

1366
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,640
where do we draw the line?
Here was,

1367
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,810
this was a big part of the fallon fox
debate about found fox becoming a

1368
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:05,440
transgender and then fighting women and
saying she's a woman now.

1369
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:06,380
Yep.
Well with,

1370
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,340
with a man's frame.
And then it becomes a sociological or

1371
01:01:10,341 --> 01:01:14,840
political issue more than a scientific
and a have a fight analysis,

1372
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:19,310
which is stupid because physically she's
built like a man fighting little girl.

1373
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:24,340
There's a bunch of different reactions
some time that one's easy to make and

1374
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,010
then there's also hips,
you know,

1375
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,080
the shape of the hips power,
but like toss it aside.

1376
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,180
But then again,
what the fuck do you do about someone

1377
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:35,510
like gabby garcia who is clearly taking
male hormones?

1378
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,000
Like where does that fit in because
that,

1379
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,970
look,
if you're fighting against women and if

1380
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:44,150
you're fighting against women who are
just taking nothing but you're taking

1381
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:45,620
male hormones,
what,

1382
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,750
where's this line?
Is it penis,

1383
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:49,820
vagina?
Is that the only line or is there a

1384
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:52,880
certain amount of hormones you take?
Will you become a fucking dude?

1385
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:55,130
And if you look,
if you do it like,

1386
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,990
um,
like chastity bono,

1387
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,690
chaz bono.
And So she takes the hormones.

1388
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:01,820
She becomes he,
she becomes chaz.

1389
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,130
That's male.
Hormones turns into a dude,

1390
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:05,720
right?
We all agree because she says it.

1391
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,570
Well,
it's gonna be cursio on more or less

1392
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:11,050
than her.
So I would suggest but more,

1393
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,290
but I would suggest that question
becomes relevant only when competition

1394
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:20,291
begins to interfere with your day
routine

1395
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,750
rights.
When it,

1396
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,960
when it starts getting into situations
where you're going to have to share,

1397
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:26,640
for example,
an example,

1398
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,980
public space,
a bathroom,

1399
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,030
some something intimate.
That's fight and sport.

1400
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,610
FighTing sports.
I love sports.

1401
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,230
It's even more in spot.
It's way more important because if gabby

1402
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:43,320
gfsi is on some shit,
she's fighting some poor girl who's just

1403
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:44,154
on,
you know,

1404
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,100
the regular protein.
That's why it's illegal to physically

1405
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:48,750
get her accidentally.
It's not illegal,

1406
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,690
so I don't legal in Japan.
That's why.

1407
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,930
Look,
right?

1408
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,840
Yeah.
fallon fox one America.

1409
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,530
Yeah.
That's situation.

1410
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,050
Toss them aside,
but it's when,

1411
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:02,250
what are we defining gender?
Are we defining it by your own personal

1412
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:04,350
choices?
Do you just decide I'm this.

1413
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:07,020
I feel like a girl would be joanna man,
and I'm going,

1414
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:09,130
wow,
let's talK about this.

1415
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,690
I mean,
if you looked at cyborg d this weekend

1416
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:15,730
and she was fighting a leslie smith,
smith,

1417
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:18,960
bless her heart,
you will look at cyborg and she's a

1418
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,840
woman of course,
but there is something about her

1419
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:26,841
physicality that clearly she just looks
like she was built to fucking bang on

1420
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:28,670
people's drama.

1421
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:30,630
If you ever seen her first fight.
No,

1422
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,790
she didn't look like that.
Okay.

1423
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,250
A lot of it is genetically modified.
The.

1424
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,290
There's a lot of speculation as to what
she did to in order to look like that,

1425
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,390
but she's also one thing.
Here's one thing,

1426
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:46,230
undeniable.
That woman works hard.

1427
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,650
She runs six miles everyday.
She trains like A fucking beast.

1428
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:51,900
Yes.
Apparently according to her trainers,

1429
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,600
she has an insane work rate.
Right.

1430
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,240
But she definitely is tested positive
for something.

1431
01:03:57,241 --> 01:04:00,440
She's does pause,
but also now she is in the ufc and I

1432
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:01,170
don't know.
We don't know.

1433
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,780
I'm not saying she's taking shit.
We got to wait until the drug results

1434
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:05,700
come back in Brazil,
this past fight,

1435
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:10,850
but at 1:40 1:35,
she's by far the best female fighter in

1436
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,850
the ufc until you beat her.
You Ain't shit dude.

1437
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,260
The way she ran punch your leslie smith
face technique is flawless.

1438
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,050
This is,
but the credit has to go to jason

1439
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:24,900
parillo,
who's her boxing coach because at her

1440
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:26,280
level she's been doing it forever,
right?

1441
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:31,430
To take a fighter that has that many
fights and to give them this set of

1442
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:32,281
skills.
Now,

1443
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:35,040
because notice this is what was most
impressive to me in that fight.

1444
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,380
She didn't get hit right.
She had head movement,

1445
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:40,080
foot work angles.
She didn't get hit.

1446
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,570
Cyborg gets hit.
When she fights,

1447
01:04:41,571 --> 01:04:45,260
she'll trade sit bang Mike Tyson style.
She had footwork.

1448
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,530
Lindsey smith,
atlanta,

1449
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,060
a single punch.
I see that one.

1450
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,120
Oh shit.
Perillo should begin all the credit and

1451
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:53,100
also perilla work and granted I've,
I've,

1452
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,510
I've never worked with pearl,
nothing.

1453
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,520
I'm just analyzing his fighters with
brisbane to bisping box.

1454
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:02,340
Anderson silva's face off a box and
clinic.

1455
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,610
I don't know if you could shake like
that and save face.

1456
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,220
I mean,
he didn't just drop.

1457
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,330
I was trying to exaggerate.
The point did drop.

1458
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,830
He dropped him,
but he also landed the most shots ever.

1459
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:12,090
An interest in civil.
Again,

1460
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,790
a veteran fighter in brisbane who's been
fighting forever.

1461
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,320
What's the one common denominator before
I forget,

1462
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:18,154
coach,
do you

1463
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:22,270
think it was dirty when anderson jumping
kneed him in the face or do you think

1464
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:26,110
that michael bisping's not supposed to
call for a resets on his mouth?

1465
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,520
Bisbing before every fight.
Herb dean or big john count.

1466
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:31,130
Go,
listen,

1467
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,590
man.
Protect yourself at all times.

1468
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,380
Don't stop unless I come in and stop.
We all know that,

1469
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:38,740
but he's trying to say my mouthpiece.
He's talking to the ref and the in,

1470
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,020
wouldn't you think?
Would you.

1471
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:43,210
Would you agree like when is there a
break in the action?

1472
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:46,690
Technically if a guy's talk to the
referee and he's moving away and he's

1473
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:47,470
not an exchange,
it's like,

1474
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,300
hey,
I'll drop my mouth.

1475
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,620
Just dropped my mouthpiece.
Is that a break in the action or is he

1476
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:54,290
calling for a break in the action and it
could be perceived these calling for a

1477
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,950
break in the action because the momentum
is not shifting his way.

1478
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,890
Correct.
look,

1479
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:01,420
I can't stop until I was like,
dude,

1480
01:06:01,421 --> 01:06:03,760
I'm.
I'm fighting to the death until that's a

1481
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:04,481
bad term.
There,

1482
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:07,600
but until a ref tells me not right on
man,

1483
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:09,070
so like when I hit cro,
cop,

1484
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:11,770
that's on herb dean step step your 40
time up son.

1485
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,440
Okay,
but should he be allowed to stop to see

1486
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:16,030
the break in the action things
ambiguous.

1487
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:17,830
Here's my thought.
If you move back,

1488
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,500
move back and you put your hands up and
you go my mouthpiece and you put your

1489
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:22,660
hands up,
you're calling for a break in the action

1490
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:24,520
and the referee says that's not your
place.

1491
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,140
Your place is to compete.
Which is correct.

1492
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,390
Or do theY have to wait to an actual
break in the action?

1493
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,580
I think they have to wait for an actual
break,

1494
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,230
but why is that?
Because you should be.

1495
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:33,250
You should not be able to fight.

1496
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,900
Look,
you should definitely be penalized.

1497
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,260
Like did you see when simon mark has
fought joe schilling kept spitting out

1498
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,170
mouthpiece so they took a point away
from them because they.

1499
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:45,910
They thought because he kept spitting it
out that he was tired and was trying to

1500
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:47,460
take a break,
which is what he was doing.

1501
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,920
Some guys do do that so that in order to
stop that from happening,

1502
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:52,030
they penalize you,
veterans,

1503
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,840
but referee,
if he knows that your mouthpiece is out,

1504
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,790
he should have stopped the fight.
So it's real.

1505
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,940
It's real tricky.
Like just the referee after what?

1506
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,540
Because you really find me looking at
something else though.

1507
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,280
Right?
You really shouldn't be able to see.

1508
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:06,430
the problem is like lips and gums with
teeth,

1509
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:08,350
with raw teeth.
your face getting fucked up.

1510
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:09,310
Man.
It's been an interesting.

1511
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:11,710
We're kind of in it.
It was like it was kinda hit it and it

1512
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:12,421
came out and he's like,
no,

1513
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:12,600
no,
no,

1514
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:12,730
no.

1515
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:13,320
Stop.
Stop.

1516
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,310
YeaH.
He was like,

1517
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,480
why?
He pointed at his mouthpiece low.

1518
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:21,070
Remember when Paul Harris with nate,
mark core turned the ref and said,

1519
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:22,000
hey,
he's got stick.

1520
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:25,280
He's got slippery stuff on his ankle and
nate just dove in and my bow bow bow

1521
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,680
that that's got to be on the fighter who
voluntarily unilaterally take salsa.

1522
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:32,380
Not.
I mean it's not dirty.

1523
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,780
It's not dirty because that's a fighter
dude.

1524
01:07:34,781 --> 01:07:37,960
It's a very dangerous sport.
I see any glimpse where I can get an

1525
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:40,570
advantage.
I'm fucking like floyd mayweather and

1526
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:43,150
victor ortiz.
I have no problem with that.

1527
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:45,450
Was that to me was fucked up.
It's no,

1528
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,040
it's a fight.
He came up and said,

1529
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:48,874
heY man,
sorry.

1530
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,870
I already said sorry twice.
And he goes,

1531
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:52,110
come on.
Oh,

1532
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,660
that's bullshit.
Bullshit.

1533
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,800
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

1534
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,560
Look,
I'll tell you what.

1535
01:07:56,561 --> 01:07:58,570
It was victorious.
He's at a mental breakdown.

1536
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,800
He was succumbing to the pressure.
He was fouling a floyd,

1537
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:06,520
had this head butting him and he got
penalized for it when it got penalized

1538
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:10,070
for it.
He wanted to make friends with floyd and

1539
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,220
in the making friends part like,
I'm sorry bro.

1540
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,260
Look,
a lot of times you can't have that in a

1541
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:15,940
fight.
You can't that in flight because the

1542
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:16,610
disruption

1543
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,370
of your focus,
it's adding in this emotional connection

1544
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:21,080
with this person.
Now this person's your buddy.

1545
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,490
Okay,
we're bros were bros,

1546
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:24,100
right?
Let's go back to fighting for like,

1547
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:26,520
fuck you.
Lap righthand.

1548
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:31,630
Cota Sleep is known for that
got knocked out by berto.

1549
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:33,530
Cold blooded.
Yeah,

1550
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:34,760
man,
I think he's done right.

1551
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:35,760
He,
it seems like should be.

1552
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,160
I think like it seems like when he got
really famous and things started taking

1553
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:41,780
off,
like he didn't,

1554
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,610
he did dancing with the stars.
Movies.

1555
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:44,880
YeaH.
The expendables.

1556
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,290
Doing well against berto.
The first five rounds like shit here.

1557
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,030
He,
because you remember they built him up

1558
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:53,480
as the next oscar de la hoya.
He was like the golden boy and then it

1559
01:08:53,481 --> 01:08:56,250
just never worked out.
Two fights I want to see as golovkin

1560
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,980
canelo and I want to say a kovalev andre
ward.

1561
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,410
Kovalev and andrea award is going to be
crazy.

1562
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:04,730
That's happening for sure.
Yeah.

1563
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:06,560
That's happening.
I can't wait for andre.

1564
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,920
Ward is so smart.
He just has to fight more.

1565
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,540
He's so smart,
but that might not be enough.

1566
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:14,450
Might not be enough against koval other
meds so hard.

1567
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,170
Well he's not so skillful is fuck
killed.

1568
01:09:17,171 --> 01:09:20,410
The guy killed his father at all.
Killer.

1569
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,570
no.
Doesn't give a fuck about,

1570
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,650
uh,
and it's kinda stupid talking about.

1571
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:26,490
But it has legs.
Floyd mayweather.

1572
01:09:26,491 --> 01:09:27,510
conor mcgregor,
you.

1573
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:30,260
and if we know,
we know doesn't have any legs.

1574
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,790
It kinda does.
It does.

1575
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,150
It kinda does.
You know why?

1576
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,940
Because floyd ones,
it doesn't matter.

1577
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,910
New ufc is not gonna let it happen.
Well,

1578
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:40,310
but see,
tHe only reason why I disagree with you

1579
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:43,910
there is because dana goes in.
Floyd wants to make that fight happened.

1580
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,950
Call me.
Dana is a businessman.

1581
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,330
They care about money.
You know big.

1582
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,280
That fight would be,
how much money do you think they could

1583
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:53,780
make if floyd mayweather fights conor
mcgregor biggest biggest paper of all

1584
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:55,350
time?
No,

1585
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,880
you don't think so?
What's of yet?

1586
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:04,110
It might be
the biggest draw already in ufc mma

1587
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,050
made,
whether it's the biggest paper,

1588
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,770
you draw a box and ball time.
You mixed the world.

1589
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,810
Everyone would tune in including your
dad.

1590
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:16,040
I would you tell them you wouldn't do an
end now because you're so full of.

1591
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:21,760
Should very unInteresting taken two hits
instead of the little baby face.

1592
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,330
If I know it's.
It's fascinating.

1593
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,870
This spark joy.
So.

1594
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:29,300
So what would happen is floyd mayweather
would box with conor mcgregor and

1595
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:31,070
basically move around and be like,
all right,

1596
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:32,630
here,
god's going to be a spectacle.

1597
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,570
It's just not a fight.
It wouldn't be a fight where you were

1598
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:38,320
fucking party pooper.
Yes.

1599
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:39,670
And then our cheer.
Yes.

1600
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:44,720
This is the thing you gotta remember the
one thing that dana and floyd mayweather

1601
01:10:44,721 --> 01:10:47,060
who would be responsible in this fight
together and connor,

1602
01:10:47,061 --> 01:10:49,850
for that matter,
all they care about is money and

1603
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:53,510
numbers.
That fight would be money and fucKing

1604
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:54,380
numbers.
It would break.

1605
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:55,700
Pack you all made with the kennedy.
okay.

1606
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:57,950
I know,
but what I'm saying is that how would,

1607
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,040
how would they,
how would that fight come?

1608
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:03,230
What would they do in that fight?
So floyd probably can knock them out

1609
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,190
anytime he wanted,
right?

1610
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,810
No,
no.

1611
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,620
Connor has a very good chin.
I mean kinda got knocked up by nate diaz

1612
01:11:09,621 --> 01:11:12,770
or he got knocked down and hurt and
wobbled by nate diaz.

1613
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:13,604
Yeah.

1614
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,720
Little gloves.
first of all,

1615
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,030
native.
ReallY good puncher needs a big guy,

1616
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,780
a nate.
Nate's fought at one 70.

1617
01:11:19,781 --> 01:11:21,840
He's a lot bigger than floyd,
like physically alive.

1618
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:26,460
but floyd is a guy who's broken his
hands many,

1619
01:11:26,461 --> 01:11:31,080
many times and he's not known for really
uncorking all of his might and trying to

1620
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:32,880
knock it down,
knock out artists in the least bit.

1621
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,370
But he could,
he certainly could.

1622
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:36,301
You know,
it's not.

1623
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:40,770
The floor doesn't hit real hard,
but when you box real smart knockouts

1624
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:43,080
come,
the opportunity comes like the ricky

1625
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:44,670
hatton fight.
That'S a perfect example.

1626
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,350
That knockout came.
Yep.

1627
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:48,410
It sound like he went looking for the
victor or five.

1628
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:50,690
Victor just fucked up and he just left
hook right hand.

1629
01:11:50,691 --> 01:11:51,511
Um,
and he was,

1630
01:11:51,511 --> 01:11:53,790
he was a total sucker punch.
Like you had no idea what was going on

1631
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,850
with it.
Has issues of scale,

1632
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:56,810
like madonna.

1633
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:02,050
I mean if you suggest the first fight he
box the shit out of them did.

1634
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,140
But it may dilute,
like if,

1635
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,450
if,
if I was college coaching that fight

1636
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:07,500
were to happen,
I'm like,

1637
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,820
hey man,
don't be pretty thin on the outside and

1638
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,510
hit this guy.
We make this a dogfight.

1639
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:14,280
You're the bigger guy.
You think connor would actually give

1640
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,950
floyd mayweather a boxing match?
Is tHat what I'm hearing?

1641
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,960
No,
that's not what anybody's saying.

1642
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,530
No,
this is the thing we're saying that he's

1643
01:12:20,531 --> 01:12:22,980
the biggest straw and saying that I
don't think floyd would juSt go out and

1644
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:27,030
try to knock them out in the box.
I think you Would canelo alvarez them,

1645
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:30,420
but key obviously canelo's way more
skillful in boxing.

1646
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:33,540
Yeah,
I mean canelo is a world champion.

1647
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:35,640
One punch knockout artists,
boxer.

1648
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:38,610
I mean that fucking amir khan knockout.
Hey jesus.

1649
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,720
Louise's,
you know,

1650
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:43,800
was a super fucking home run on the
button.

1651
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:45,690
Dude,
floyd got hit.

1652
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:49,290
He said after he got.
When he fought canelo he got punched in

1653
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,500
the thigh by canelo had trouble walking
for two days.

1654
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,440
He literally,
he didn't show it after the fight.

1655
01:12:55,441 --> 01:12:55,951
He was like,
dude,

1656
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:58,860
my thigh.
He punched me in the thigh so hard.

1657
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:00,860
I,
I am having trouble walking that to

1658
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,790
live.
Lloyd is never going to fight mma

1659
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,810
because if connor would fucking break
his legs like literally mma be.

1660
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:10,360
It would be more embarraSsing than tonic
doing just box.

1661
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:14,160
He would get way more embarrassing
because is a big guy.

1662
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:17,640
Employed would have to like box smart
alec connor.

1663
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:22,650
I think kinda would have just
unbelievably difficult time even coming

1664
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:24,080
close to hitting him.
I man,

1665
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:27,000
I think he's gonna straight boxing with
grazing stuff.

1666
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:29,520
He's probably.
You're Talking about if not the greatest

1667
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:31,170
boxer of all time and his defense is
good.

1668
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,450
It would be a great show.
It's a good.

1669
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:38,070
It'd be the best defense ever for sure.
Who's on the fence in floyd and now

1670
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:42,240
you're taking a guy who he's an elite
strike in the ufc but boxing's a

1671
01:13:42,241 --> 01:13:43,680
different game.
Man.

1672
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:44,471
You know,
I would.

1673
01:13:44,471 --> 01:13:48,690
Would've loved to seen canelo fight
floyd like in a couple of years when

1674
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:53,691
canelo's like 27,
28 when he has the experience because I

1675
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:57,640
think like if you look at like sugar ray
leonard versus roberto duran,

1676
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:02,690
like both guys were like really in their
prime experience world in big.

1677
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,590
You know what I mean?
Sometimes like your prime comes early,

1678
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:10,530
like tyson and sometimes you prime comes
later,

1679
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,800
you know bernard hopkins.
But when a guy's in his prime,

1680
01:14:13,801 --> 01:14:16,390
he know he's in his prime.
I think canelo wasn't in his prime when

1681
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:17,860
he fought for.
I think I still don't.

1682
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:21,640
I think he's getting there and if I'm
canelo's management and as a fan I won't

1683
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:24,640
see canelo triple g and greg,
they say canal is probably gonna have to

1684
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:25,360
vacate and his belt.

1685
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,360
If he doesn't fight triple g,
that's what they're saying.

1686
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,233
But that.
Wait,

1687
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:31,030
why does he want 1:55 that's not
middleweight.

1688
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:35,080
Like why are they sending it?
Is making all these fights at 1:55 and

1689
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:37,390
they're calling a middleweight because
it's over 1:54.

1690
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:39,540
Yeah.
They have a weird thing going on.

1691
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,490
That's what's wrong with boxing.
But if i'M canelo's camp,

1692
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,740
I'm not sending that fight up yet.
Man.

1693
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,940
As a fan I'm like,
dear god,

1694
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,770
make that fight happened.
He a businessman,

1695
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:48,580
a manager.
I'm like,

1696
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,500
canola,
you ain't find triple g right now.

1697
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:54,820
We don't do a couple more big paydays
and because also you gotta remember

1698
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:56,550
triple g's not a draw.
We know him.

1699
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,030
We're in the fight.
He's not a draw at all.

1700
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:02,740
His paper you did I think 125,000.
175,000 and then listen,

1701
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,040
big drama show big drama drama show soon
as the belt series business.

1702
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,050
That guy,
he's awesome,

1703
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,000
but he's not,
he's just not like a,

1704
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,490
as far as being a paper view,
drawing power.

1705
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:19,300
He's not there yet.
So the new 30 and knock him the fuck

1706
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:20,134
out.
He won't do it.

1707
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:23,290
He won't do it.
You toss canelo like lemieux or someone

1708
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,510
else so you can just merch and keep
building his name.

1709
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:27,670
well he wants to go.
Uh,

1710
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:30,790
he wanted to be one 60 and canelo wants
it to be 1:55.

1711
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,400
Apparently that's a hold up.
And you know,

1712
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,230
he triples.
He's a bigger guy.

1713
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:37,840
If triple g has,
she dropped down five pounds,

1714
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:39,190
they think it'll be enough to weaken
them.

1715
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:41,080
And you know,
maybe canelo can have a chance and they

1716
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:44,890
can slug it out in the trenches.
But If you look at the fight,

1717
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:50,130
the actual fight itself,
when amir khan just fought canelo,

1718
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:53,950
he did expose that speed and movement
are still a problem.

1719
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:54,850
Yes.
It just,

1720
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:56,650
he doesn't have the same speed or the
same movement.

1721
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:59,560
It's floyd,
but his speed and movement were a bit of

1722
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:00,970
a problem.
You have some real issues,

1723
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:02,950
some real estate to his landing all
night.

1724
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,510
Yes.
Especially in the first round.

1725
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,550
The first round he lit him up with some
straight right hand.

1726
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:07,361
So that was like,
ooo,

1727
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:09,430
okay,
how's this gonna play out?

1728
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,550
But I think that there is no one else in
that division that can do that.

1729
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:15,650
Photo couldn't do it to him.
Canelo outbox codo mean.

1730
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,100
Um,
and then floyd was really the only guy

1731
01:16:18,101 --> 01:16:19,360
to expose it.
But floyd floyd,

1732
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:22,040
there's no other floyd's yeah.
So who the fuck else is in the division?

1733
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:27,060
But I think triple g canelo right now is
that it'd be a bad decision for canelo

1734
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:31,870
will terrence crawford is 1:47,
so talented 1:47 and one slash four and

1735
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,940
next door neighbors my.

1736
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:33,880
OH,
here it is.

1737
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,530
They fight over like two and three
pounds.

1738
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,410
It's crazy.
I can make the weight different than mma

1739
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:39,850
in that regard.
So weird mma,

1740
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:42,460
you're dealing with a middle way to
light heavyweight,

1741
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:46,120
which guys jumped back and forth.
You dealing with 20 fucking pounds.

1742
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:47,410
I mean,
that's madness.

1743
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:49,910
Be more away classes.
Yeah.

1744
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,380
I've been saying this from the jump.
There should be a weight class every 10

1745
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:54,640
pounds and they're like,
well,

1746
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:56,320
if there's too many champions in waters
down,

1747
01:16:56,410 --> 01:17:00,040
I completely disagree.
You're telling me some of these amazing

1748
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:03,280
fighters that you have that are
superstars like a donald cerrone,

1749
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:06,080
like a diego sanchez,
like all these different guys,

1750
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:07,270
so it was just so amazing.
Guys.

1751
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:10,040
I've never won a title that are huge
favorites,

1752
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,750
right?
If you look at all these different guys,

1753
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,600
uriah favors and other ones you're
telling me those guys couldn't have been

1754
01:17:14,601 --> 01:17:19,580
champions and you wouldn't have had even
more champions and an even crazier thing

1755
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:22,170
if there were.
If there was a weight class every teN

1756
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,210
pounds and a better product a better.
You're getting better performances from

1757
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,190
because donald's not destroying his body
to make 55.

1758
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,430
You're not having these monsters make
these weight classes and the actual

1759
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:33,680
world champions.
There's sponsorships.

1760
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:36,950
So enough weight classes.
There's classes two.

1761
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:37,351
Oh,
six,

1762
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:38,210
two,
two 65.

1763
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:39,830
How dare you?
It's crazy.

1764
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:41,860
It's crazy.
It's crazy,

1765
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:42,810
right?
Tim?

1766
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:45,050
It too,
but what's interesting is the best guys

1767
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:50,051
seem to like flatten out around 2:42.
so my thought is let's make a to 40,

1768
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:55,270
let's make that heavyweight and then two
and a half to two to 40 to 65 or a

1769
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:56,270
little champions.

1770
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:57,470
The better.
All the way up.

1771
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:02,910
The only time you Can't.
It's like a little bit of a problem.

1772
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,150
A problem is with cyborg,
right?

1773
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:06,740
Because she's like,
she goes,

1774
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:10,730
I'll fight anyone at 1:40,
but at one forties have I heard from my

1775
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:12,410
source?
It was a beast for it to get to.

1776
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,620
I think she's the 1:45 pound invicta
champion.

1777
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:20,621
They have a 1:35 in the ufc 1:45 and I
think you can do 1:40 5:40.

1778
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:23,060
Why?
But why do it?

1779
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:25,340
Why maker make it?
She's a 1:45 pound champ.

1780
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,620
I know,
but there's not a lot of all the

1781
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:31,580
superstars on 1:35 can make 1:40 to make
them put on 10 pounds.

1782
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:36,581
Ever build it.
They will come have right now mr rogen

1783
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,410
right now.
You understand she's the invicta

1784
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:41,270
champion,
so she's fighting people in invicta.

1785
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:42,730
Hey,
yeah,

1786
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,573
look,
it's true.

1787
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,350
She's better than all of them anyway.

1788
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:48,050
It doesn't matter,
but you shouldn't be forcing her to kill

1789
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:50,330
herself.
When 1:45 is already established.

1790
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:52,880
Weight class.
Misha tate was the 1:45 pound champion.

1791
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,040
Strikeforce.
It's good point.

1792
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:56,170
Established way that you would fight or
two.

1793
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:59,480
It's an established weight class,
I think at 1:40 though.

1794
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,880
Well listen,
holly homes for people in boxing as high

1795
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:05,440
as 1:52.
It's 1:45 and established weight class

1796
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:08,760
to sign up the house.
How doeS holly holm do cyborg?

1797
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:13,850
A holly holm as his.
She has the best chance because cyborg

1798
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:17,390
is a ruthless marauder.
She's berserker a tower.

1799
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,540
Shoot the box style.
Not this last night.

1800
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:20,860
No,
she wasn't this last site.

1801
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,140
Who will and those hits.
I was like,

1802
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:28,010
oh shit.
That counter that counter right hands

1803
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:30,310
now.
So let's fix these card.

1804
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,810
Nice hard core.
She's mad at thomas.

1805
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:33,870
She's a beast.
She should.

1806
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,020
She should.
She should.

1807
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,700
She should definitely thanked the
referee.

1808
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,520
The referee saved her from herself.
Yes,

1809
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,500
but she's just so tough fighter.
She's so tough that you want.

1810
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,260
She wanted to go out on our shield.
Yeah.

1811
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:47,360
She was already gone.
She doesn't understand ground and pound.

1812
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:52,390
That shit is ill fate or days.
She was punching him in the face.

1813
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,880
She's so much more advanced than anybody
else creates so much more to perillo.

1814
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,800
Well,
she's different than holly.

1815
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:03,770
Completely.
Holly is a counter striker and holly

1816
01:20:03,771 --> 01:20:08,670
also had a really brutal knockout in
boxing against a larger woman and have

1817
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,600
watched it.
I was like,

1818
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,810
whoa.
It's the kind of knockout that you never

1819
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:17,300
really fight that way again because you
realize the consequences now and like

1820
01:20:17,301 --> 01:20:19,930
someone gets brutally,
brutally knocked out there,

1821
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:24,330
aware of that as a consequence and I
think she's become much more of a

1822
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,610
defensive minded counter striker,
which was super effective against ronda

1823
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,040
better I think for her.

1824
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:30,960
Right.
But it didn't look so good against misha

1825
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:34,620
because misha was fighting super smart,
but it was also.

1826
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,740
Well,
it's also because misha doesn't rush

1827
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:42,110
after all your anxiety on the outside
flat.

1828
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:44,220
Amazing.
But I also thought for whatever reason

1829
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,190
holly didn't fight like herself.
She doesn't like was it pulling the

1830
01:20:47,191 --> 01:20:49,560
trigger?
She doesn't like to lead to lead and

1831
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:52,290
she's worried about being taken down.
Once she got taken down by me shaLl we

1832
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,110
realized why she doesn't like to lead
me,

1833
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,920
should took her down,
beat the shit out of her on the ground,

1834
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:59,930
like destroyed her in that second round
was on top of or most of the round just

1835
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,710
beating her ass.
And so we knew,

1836
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:02,850
look of me,
she gets her down,

1837
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:05,010
she's fucked.
So then she fights like a,

1838
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,500
like a craftsman to the third and fourth
round.

1839
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:10,110
She just fights real smart,
stays on the outside edges,

1840
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:10,944
those rounds.

1841
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,830
And then she's forced to go for broke
and the fifth and mission wound up

1842
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:15,780
taking her out and choking.
Right story,

1843
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:16,614
man.
So,

1844
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,730
but Here's the thing.
cyborgs way better on the ground.

1845
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,900
I mean way better on the ground and
strong.

1846
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,750
Way better way,
way better.

1847
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,590
Way better.
Cyborg wind,

1848
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:33,860
straight jujitsu competitions.
She is fucking strong.

1849
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:38,770
Your fucking face.
Suplexes she just made she dahlan bitch

1850
01:21:38,771 --> 01:21:40,980
and she gets on top of you.
Oh my god.

1851
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:45,090
Her grounded pound.
it looks like a panther,

1852
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:47,820
like she looks like.
It's almost like she was put on earth

1853
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:48,950
for one thing.
Well,

1854
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,490
when she's in that ring,
that cage,

1855
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:52,650
you're just doing shit to.
You beat her.

1856
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:53,460
Yeah.
She's.

1857
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,390
She's built herself into that.
It's taken so long for her to finally

1858
01:21:57,391 --> 01:21:59,640
get her.
Now she's here and everyone's like,

1859
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,960
god,
even when she's here,

1860
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:01,281
man,
they.

1861
01:22:01,281 --> 01:22:02,300
They did it in Brazil.

1862
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,020
They did it at 1:42.
They made her suffer.

1863
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:08,340
I would have my personal choice.
I would have had the first ever 145

1864
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:12,480
pound fight in the ufc.
Led a bunch of people sign up to be who

1865
01:22:12,481 --> 01:22:16,200
wants to.
Who wants to get in there and my man the

1866
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,360
price.
But I think you've got invicta girls

1867
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:20,220
that are agreeing to fight her.
So if you've got invicta,

1868
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:22,020
girls are agreeing to fight.
Are you telling me those girls wouldn't

1869
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:23,750
take a fight in the ufc?
Of course I'm telling you,

1870
01:22:23,751 --> 01:22:25,070
no one would care.
Frank get.

1871
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:27,150
Doesn't matter.
It's the cyborg show.

1872
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:28,920
Do it.
It's the sideboard show right now.

1873
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:32,790
This is Mike Tyson versus people that
you don't know and you know it's turning

1874
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:34,960
tubs.
Mike tyson versus tony tops.

1875
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:37,650
She has a ways to go where she's Mike
Tyson.

1876
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,030
She just got introduced to when you went
to see Mike Tyson versus tony tubs.

1877
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:44,210
Didn't think tony tubs.
Gonna win a tony thompson.

1878
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:46,080
You went to see the Mike Tyson shot?
No,

1879
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:51,081
I was there to see tony title.
If you're me,

1880
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,830
shows manager and they're like,
hey,

1881
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,580
we need you to find at 1:45 sidebar.
Take me.

1882
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,620
Show me.
I think mishi would take that shit and

1883
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,960
take it,
but no one else like that in a good move

1884
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:03,490
that dope and listen,
you know,

1885
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,380
cyborg.
Like,

1886
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,740
go back to the gina carano fight.

1887
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,380
Cyborg had problems in that fight so
people don't understand.

1888
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:12,280
Gina carano had her mounted.
Giancana was a tough fucking girl.

1889
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,240
They duked it out.
Gina literally was on top of her head

1890
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,730
are mounted.
Cyborg wasn't the same sideboard back

1891
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:21,490
then,
but sidebar was way more shredded back

1892
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:22,330
then.
She was,

1893
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,340
she was like a bodybuilder man.
She's terrifying.

1894
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,010
Like just the physical muscular,
the muscularity and the power that she

1895
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:31,750
had.
There's a picture that I'll never

1896
01:23:31,751 --> 01:23:32,321
forget,
man,

1897
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:35,710
is one of,
if I have like a list of all my iconic

1898
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:40,711
memories of phoTographs in mma,
there'S one where cyborg is grabbing the

1899
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:45,220
head of gina carano.
She's got her fingers out,

1900
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,980
she's got an mma glove on with nail
polish on,

1901
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:52,600
and she's about to punch her in the face
and gina's phases already fucked up and

1902
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:55,370
cyborgs holding her head and she's about
to.

1903
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:56,200
There it is right there.

1904
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,150
Look at that.
Look at that.

1905
01:23:58,151 --> 01:24:01,510
Come on son.
that is an iconic photo.

1906
01:24:01,511 --> 01:24:05,500
Look at the eyes,
the cold blooded killers in the

1907
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,470
background.
It shows up.

1908
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:12,190
Boom.
She's asleep and robbing a right hand on

1909
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:14,740
her.
Fucking crushing her.

1910
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:15,800
Feel that bitch.
Yeah,

1911
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:19,030
and this is by the way,
the cyborg Washington,

1912
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:22,150
but look at the muscles on her fucking
shoulder and your arm and the cyborg

1913
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:24,760
you're looking at today.
The cyborg.

1914
01:24:24,761 --> 01:24:27,670
You look at it to say,
what the fuck this cyborg up for sure,

1915
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,100
and she's better now.
She's,

1916
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,450
she's fucking dedicated,
man.

1917
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:34,360
I'm just doing the damn thing ever seen
some of the videos of her training at a

1918
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,560
paquette top team?
Nope.

1919
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,860
Taking good lord.
She spends a lot of time at Thailand

1920
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:42,180
running hills and training with men.
I saw the,

1921
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:43,330
I saw the,
uh,

1922
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:44,770
the,
her man,

1923
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,660
the old man.
And what?

1924
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:51,910
This cyborg santos fight and bella tour
this past week.

1925
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,351
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1926
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:53,184
yeah.
He,

1927
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,033
well,
he,

1928
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:58,270
he commit to bars.
Weird snatcher because he won in the

1929
01:24:58,271 --> 01:24:59,860
first fight with a knee bar.
Yeah.

1930
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,800
So this time he committed to it and it's
gonna hit them like for sure let go.

1931
01:25:02,801 --> 01:25:05,050
Then he bar for sure,
like it was too late.

1932
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:08,620
There's a picture of her and him,
her husband and her.

1933
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,030
Oh.
They have their backs,

1934
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:13,130
their backs and her back is every bit as
well.

1935
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:16,180
They have one way to ask this and it's
both of them just like.

1936
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:18,790
That's unfortunate.
Is that picture where you see it?

1937
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:19,910
No,
it's awesome.

1938
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,190
Friends talked them out of those kind of
photo.

1939
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,390
I disagree.
It's like the brazilian colona

1940
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:30,840
colona
boom by,

1941
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,360
but I think it's boom by a bom.
Dia.

1942
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,530
No.
How about matt brown could have gotten

1943
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,230
any worse?

1944
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:42,130
I didn't say it.
My fucking my goddamn dvr fucked up.

1945
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:45,550
Somehow my kids put like max and ruby on
or some shit,

1946
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,380
you know,
like,

1947
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:50,080
like sometimes people try to have two
things being taped.

1948
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,210
It stops.
My wife will move up.

1949
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:55,540
The kid shows to the top of the order.
So I didn't,

1950
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:59,120
I didn't even watch this.
So he gets fucked up by the fans and

1951
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:01,690
they kicked this fan out by the way,
the fifth punched him in the face

1952
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,560
because he's flipping everyone off weigh
ins.

1953
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,310
And then his old coach after the fight,
he was in their head,

1954
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:08,170
man.
They got mad.

1955
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,730
A couple guys smacked him in the head
they took.

1956
01:26:10,731 --> 01:26:12,350
They took that dude out of the arena
though.

1957
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,510
Yeah.
But a couple of guys smacked him in the

1958
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:16,550
head as he's running in before the guy
punched him.

1959
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:18,410
I'm saying they took one of the guys out
to smack them.

1960
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:20,390
Oh,
did they really should have taken all of

1961
01:26:20,391 --> 01:26:21,160
them.
I agree.

1962
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,610
Stupid.
Hey security.

1963
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:24,380
Step your fucking game up.
But it's Just,

1964
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,010
it's embarrassing.
Oh shucks.

1965
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,100
Someone though.
Oh yeah.

1966
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:30,170
Dude,
he uncorked a bomb on someone's face.

1967
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:32,240
Damien maia,
matt brown in the face.

1968
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:35,770
Damien maia said,
welcome to my country about to choke.

1969
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,880
So I love to see the fight.
Man.

1970
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,290
Can you.
Can we find the fight?

1971
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:40,640
Jamie?
See if you can find the fight.

1972
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:42,260
So what?
We'll do commentary,

1973
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:46,640
but how bout how bout afterwards?
He's in the hotel and his old coach

1974
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,830
sucker punched in back of the head.
That's what I heard.

1975
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:53,840
And then got his old coaches,
old brown brown's old grappling punch

1976
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,490
sucker.
Punched him back in the head and then he

1977
01:26:55,491 --> 01:26:56,900
runs off.
Oh no,

1978
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:58,910
you ain't running because matt brennan's
coaches around.

1979
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:02,870
Lisa bowling is other coach.
They catch this dude beat the brakes off

1980
01:27:02,871 --> 01:27:04,070
of him and got arrested.

1981
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,190
Read harris was just like,
hey,

1982
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:08,310
just went all aggro.
Caught the studio.

1983
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:10,100
Why they punched him in the back of the
head?

1984
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:13,100
Because they have a history.
What an asshole.

1985
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,320
Yeah,
but can you get a p on my big huge dick?

1986
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:18,590
I'll be right back.
Let us know about it.

1987
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:23,000
Thinking about
he's all trimmed up,

1988
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:24,120
huh?
Okay.

1989
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,750
How much does he lost?
I swear to god.

1990
01:27:26,751 --> 01:27:31,640
He's got to be usually walked around at
2:55 and every bit he's probably to 40

1991
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:33,890
right now.
Has it made you think about changing

1992
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:36,380
your diet now?
You like eating bread and shit?

1993
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,160
Yeah,
I do well with carbs like rice and eat

1994
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,730
pretty clean rice.
Potatoes.

1995
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:41,481
I don't,
I don't mind it.

1996
01:27:41,481 --> 01:27:43,520
I,
I don't think I'm the body type.

1997
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:44,960
I think I'd get even skinnier.
Dude,

1998
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:45,620
I,
you know,

1999
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:48,140
for me I need all the carbs I can get.

2000
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:52,190
I sleep well on carbs.
Have you ever tried not having them?

2001
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,200
No.
So how do you know?

2002
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,350
No,
I mean I have though.

2003
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,420
Actually that's not true.
I don't,

2004
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:59,150
I,
I stay very far away from sugar to them,

2005
01:27:59,151 --> 01:28:02,030
but that's I think the most important
thing to sugar.

2006
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,180
That's what I was telling people when I
moved the first attempt at doing

2007
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:05,950
something.
I went,

2008
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,610
I tried gluten,
no gluten,

2009
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,830
but I think the real issue is I wasn't
eating bread,

2010
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:12,200
so if I'm eating bread I'm not getting
sugar.

2011
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:13,520
Exactly.
Exactly.

2012
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,070
And when I,
and I don't eat a lot of bread because

2013
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:20,270
I'm aware of because I monitor my body
like so if I eat two slices,

2014
01:28:20,271 --> 01:28:24,770
even if really good bread,
I notice that my energy kind of.

2015
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:27,170
It's not the same as if I eat slow
cooked oatmeal,

2016
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,610
I feel really good.
Right?

2017
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:29,720
Yeah.

2018
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,650
There's definitely some spikes going on.
Insulin spikes going on when you eat

2019
01:28:33,651 --> 01:28:35,900
sugar and you eat bread and we're just
used to them.

2020
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:38,360
Remember I only eat a lot either.
That's the other thing.

2021
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:39,450
Like I don't,
I'm not a big deal.

2022
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,140
We got to fight and here it is.
Damien maia and matt brown.

2023
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:44,780
This is around three.
Okay.

2024
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,670
We don't know what was going on before
that,

2025
01:28:46,671 --> 01:28:50,330
but we assume it was good.
They don't look too sprawling.

2026
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,540
He's trying to.
He's trying to keep it standing up with

2027
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,280
damien.
Maia is doing a good job of standing on

2028
01:28:55,281 --> 01:28:59,030
the outside of,
but he's making it a real obvious that

2029
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:02,040
he wants to take them down and shoots in
as move away from the

2030
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,990
keck.
He's so big at one 70.

2031
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:06,750
My miles a beast at one 70.
I never seen him in person.

2032
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,550
I mean you fought for the title at one
85.

2033
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:09,950
Who's a big guy.
Whoo.

2034
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,180
Good job there by mine and he tries to
take down again.

2035
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,360
Matt brown punches him and matt brown
gets on top.

2036
01:29:15,361 --> 01:29:16,500
This is where you fucked up,
man.

2037
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:18,480
Can't do that dude.
That's a trap.

2038
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,540
You trap you.
We thought he heard them.

2039
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,840
You know he didn't really hurt him.
Damien maia did exactly.

2040
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:27,360
Britain shop just returns.
He did exactly what we were saying about

2041
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,390
for breach over dealing with fader.
He pretends he gets hurt and matt brown

2042
01:29:30,391 --> 01:29:35,220
moved in to try to finish them.
And then maya got ahold of him in my

2043
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,410
drag them to the ground.
This is how confident he is in his

2044
01:29:37,411 --> 01:29:38,910
jujitsu.
He lets him mount him.

2045
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,790
I mean he drags him to the ground just
to do this,

2046
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:42,570
just to sweep them.

2047
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:45,570
And now matt brown,
that sequence,

2048
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:49,080
that whole sequence was so advanced.
What he just did theRe,

2049
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:52,350
he let matt brown drag him down in matt
brown.

2050
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,620
His instincts is a destroyer.
Were to immeDiately get on top of him

2051
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:57,870
because he's not seen that in training.
No one's done training.

2052
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,060
No.
Especially not allowing him to

2053
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,790
potentially knock them out with some
ground and pound,

2054
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:07,860
but damien maia is jujitsu is so solid
and so slick that whatever shot

2055
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:10,110
attempts,
he gets off mostly a deflected and then

2056
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,380
eventually sweeps him and now he's
mounting up against the cage and matt

2057
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:17,340
brown right now is in quicksand.
When you have damien maia on top of you

2058
01:30:17,341 --> 01:30:19,290
and your legs are pinned together like
that.

2059
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,460
That's a terrifying because what he's
done here is he's isolated his legs with

2060
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:26,130
a triangle.
So by having those legs extended like

2061
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:28,050
that,
he has no power from his hips.

2062
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:30,720
He can't throw any punches,
he can't get his feet back under them

2063
01:30:30,721 --> 01:30:33,930
and can't get those legs back.
So he's got to commit with his hands.

2064
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,720
So he's got to push down with his hands
and while he's pushing down his hands,

2065
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:40,500
mike and punch him in the face.
And so finally he gets his half guard

2066
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:41,880
back up.
But whatever.

2067
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:45,150
Good luck with that butterfly.
He'll get these butterflies,

2068
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:47,220
a mild.
We'll just sit on your legs and wear

2069
01:30:47,221 --> 01:30:49,290
them out,
put pressure on you,

2070
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:51,800
and then when you stand up and just get
to an even better position.

2071
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:53,300
This for all three rounds by the.
Well,

2072
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:54,480
this is what he does,
man.

2073
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:58,410
He did it to rick story.
Rick story is a real law.

2074
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:03,530
He's a gorilla wrestler who walks around
a 200 cuts down to one 70 and demian

2075
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:06,060
maia ragdoll.
That wasn't that precedent.

2076
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:09,640
He did it to gunner nelson and then neil
magnums like,

2077
01:31:09,641 --> 01:31:10,381
oh,
you're on a winning streak.

2078
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:11,520
That's cool.
Check this out.

2079
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:18,600
Jake shields beat damien maia grappling
contest will create eight.

2080
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:21,870
Shields is legit.
One of the best in the world and as a

2081
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:23,550
grappler,
one of the best in the world.

2082
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,370
I beat him in the ufc.
Yeah,

2083
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,480
I mean,
but that's my grappling.

2084
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:29,160
Yeah,
because if they were grappling,

2085
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:30,690
jake would give him a hell of a fucking
run.

2086
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:34,720
Jake is a base dude.
His grappling is absolutely world class.

2087
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,180
Oh yeah.
His problem in the ufc,

2088
01:31:36,181 --> 01:31:37,950
he's always been a speed and the
striking.

2089
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:41,060
He's just not a dangerous striker in the
way a lot of guys are.

2090
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,800
It's not even that he's a born fighter,
well,

2091
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,960
not to me,
to the breast.

2092
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:48,280
So you look at you look at who he's
been.

2093
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:51,720
This he's beat the very best.
He's beat I think top five guys.

2094
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:54,960
He's beat robbie lawler.
Look at all these guys.

2095
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:56,750
Damien maia,
hey,

2096
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:57,623
you had this.

2097
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,410
He's trying.
He's trying to protect himself,

2098
01:31:59,411 --> 01:32:02,380
but it's just few tile.
It's just when maya gets that body

2099
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:05,440
triangle round on you,
he's just constantly manipulating you.

2100
01:32:05,441 --> 01:32:10,441
He doesn't try and one direction only
like he is setting up escape doors.

2101
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,940
So if you try to move through one of
those escape doors,

2102
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:16,450
a new trap is waiting for you and those
traps you're not going to see because

2103
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,610
from years and years and years of
jujitsu,

2104
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,130
so your basic movements that usually get
you out.

2105
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,890
It happen right in the face.
Over and over.

2106
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:24,773
Yeah.
I don't say,

2107
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:26,260
hey,
well let me ask you this.

2108
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,670
You would know this.
Why?

2109
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:31,840
WHen they showed the top contenders in
185 pound weight class was yoel romero

2110
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:34,230
not there because he's just got clear
because he just got.

2111
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,680
Well,
he didn't get cleared to fight again.

2112
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,410
He,
they cleared the possibility that he

2113
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:42,190
might get a lesser sentence because they
found that supplement that he took,

2114
01:32:42,191 --> 01:32:45,790
but you're not supposed to take
supplements when you just buy some shit

2115
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:46,330
at gnc.

2116
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:48,880
He's just beat.
Mine has just beaten on them and

2117
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,340
manipulating them with that body
triangle man.

2118
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,830
crazy.
Because there is not clear.

2119
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:54,840
I thought it was clear to fight.
No,

2120
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,130
no,
I don't think they've made a clear

2121
01:32:57,131 --> 01:32:59,690
decision yet.
But they've opened the door for him with

2122
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,521
that.
Oh my god.

2123
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:02,440
He tried to punch back behind him.
That's.

2124
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,360
I'm surprised you did that.
Well,

2125
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:06,480
he's done exactly once.
It's under the neck.

2126
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:07,460
No,
this one.

2127
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:10,420
This one's over.
There's not much bad ass.

2128
01:33:10,421 --> 01:33:12,610
Is matt brown though?
Oh my god.

2129
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:15,100
He's bad ass.
But I'm Just so impressed with damien

2130
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:17,580
maia mean.
How do you not be impressed with damien?

2131
01:33:17,581 --> 01:33:19,660
My title shot next.
Fuck yeah.

2132
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:23,050
Fuck yeah.
Was by the western through all these

2133
01:33:23,051 --> 01:33:25,960
young kids.
Those guys down there all fucked.

2134
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,950
They're all fucked.
Damien maia.

2135
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:31,270
If you don't knock him out and at one 70
that ain't no picnic because he can

2136
01:33:31,271 --> 01:33:32,090
strike.

2137
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:34,420
You can hit hard man.
Well,

2138
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:35,830
if you decide to strike with robbie
lawler.

2139
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:37,240
Kidding.
I don't think he will.

2140
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,410
I mean,
I don't think he will.

2141
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:39,340
He's gonna.
He's gonna.

2142
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,350
Try to turn them into one of these.
I agree dude.

2143
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:43,870
He's the master when it comes to
jujitsu.

2144
01:33:43,871 --> 01:33:48,280
He is the ufc master because he is at
all of the guys.

2145
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:52,490
He's the one guy that's fought the most
intelligently with jujitsu because look

2146
01:33:52,491 --> 01:33:54,640
it for brief ceo.
His striking got better.

2147
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:57,340
He got better with striking,
striking ultimately cost him.

2148
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:58,910
Yes.
Whereas my,

2149
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:01,450
uh,
is just never gone off track.

2150
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,860
He used to pee.
This is new though.

2151
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:04,480
This new winning streak.
Because remember before.

2152
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:05,510
Yeah.
When.

2153
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,880
Yeah,
when you went down to one 71 85 years

2154
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:10,180
trying to strike.
We can do too much.

2155
01:34:10,181 --> 01:34:12,370
It was too small.
He wasn't strong enough to overwhelm

2156
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:15,460
them at one slash 70 but,
or I want 85 but it won 70.

2157
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:19,060
He is going to be tough to beat man.
I want to see.

2158
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:22,120
I'm excited to see a fight.
A look.

2159
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:23,830
Yeah.
Speaking of jujitsu.

2160
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,600
Well,
luke's got to get past weidman.

2161
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:28,180
No,
the rematch with weidman is going to be

2162
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,290
crazy.
Interesting.

2163
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:32,020
Look,
weidman made a big mistake in that fight

2164
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,200
before that big mistake,
which was yes,

2165
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:37,510
it was a very close fight.
It was like,

2166
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:40,330
who knows what was going on and now
weidman says he had a broken foot,

2167
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:42,070
but luke said he had a bad staph
infection.

2168
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:45,820
You know more than anybody when you go
into fights most of the time you're not

2169
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:47,090
100 percent,
100 percent.

2170
01:34:47,091 --> 01:34:50,230
And with with weidman,
from what I hear from this campaign from

2171
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:52,660
him is it was the worst camp of his
life.

2172
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:56,500
Like he knew he needed to change things,
but he thought he was so talented as

2173
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:57,160
real champions.

2174
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,370
Fine.
Didn't even do anything.

2175
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:02,150
Why was it the worst camp?
I guess he had injuries and certain

2176
01:35:02,151 --> 01:35:06,150
things like he should have been flying
people in and he just didn't in a.

2177
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,760
He should have been going somewhere
else.

2178
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:11,010
Was working with Mark Henry Moore and
doing other stuff and he's just a good

2179
01:35:11,011 --> 01:35:13,070
man.
I'm chant and it kind of got comfortable

2180
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:17,110
and it ended up costing them.
This is no,

2181
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:21,010
this is no gimme fight for either god or
either guy.

2182
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:22,880
This is a great fight.
This is a war,

2183
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:23,700
a war,
you know?

2184
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:26,450
I mean rockhold thinks he's going to run
through them this time because he thinks

2185
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:28,530
he doesn't have a staph infection and
you know,

2186
01:35:28,531 --> 01:35:31,640
the staph infection was physically like
really bad and he thinks he also is

2187
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:35,450
rotting on the confidence of having pete
and ham having beaten the living fuck

2188
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:36,440
out of leo machida.

2189
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:40,070
His top game is some of the nastiest
shit I've ever seen in my life.

2190
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,380
So good dude.
That's what happens.

2191
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:44,540
He's a big dude,
but he's also really talented.

2192
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:47,730
Really smart,
works hard and he trains with two

2193
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:52,800
fucking cain velasquez and danny,
so he's going to waR with gorillas and

2194
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,810
time.
Habib habib,

2195
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:59,480
I think training with a guy that's as
high level as habib.

2196
01:35:59,481 --> 01:36:01,250
You miRror some of his movements,
you,

2197
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:05,020
you understand what he's doing.
And then habib's dad down there helping

2198
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,710
guys out there.
A data coach.

2199
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:07,101
Oh,
he.

2200
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:09,160
His dad coached habib.
You know what I mean?

2201
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:13,850
His dad's always around at bb and his
dad coached a few other guys that fought

2202
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:17,600
in the ufc as well,
but you're also getting from habib and

2203
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,080
dc and cane.
You also Picking up their training

2204
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:25,670
tendencies of the blueprint of these
elite of the elite and three of them and

2205
01:36:25,671 --> 01:36:28,190
the four of them are coming together and
cook too.

2206
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:29,510
Man.
Bob cook's a wizard.

2207
01:36:29,511 --> 01:36:34,511
Javier mendez is a wizard mean you got.
You got great talent as far as coaching.

2208
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:36,590
They're all.
They all have fights coming up.

2209
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:39,020
They're all together.
He's also about as big as you can get

2210
01:36:39,021 --> 01:36:42,650
for an 85 or like he walked around.
He was trying to choose 16.

2211
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:44,570
You know,
like that's a big guy,

2212
01:36:44,571 --> 01:36:45,404
you know,
that's a lot of ways.

2213
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,790
He's,
he's slim right now.

2214
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:48,320
He's in shape right now.
I just saw him this weekend.

2215
01:36:48,321 --> 01:36:50,210
He's slim while he's fighting in a
couple of weeks.

2216
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,720
he was fighting for two weeks before he
was 215 pounds here.

2217
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:57,690
It's out here now.
Late June 4th is June 4th,

2218
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,170
June 3rd and fourth.
Yeah,

2219
01:36:59,240 --> 01:36:59,960
that's right.
Yeah.

2220
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:00,800
That weekend.
Yeah.

2221
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:02,180
That's a,
that's a big,

2222
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,880
big fight in the middleweight division.
It's not getting enough attention,

2223
01:37:04,881 --> 01:37:05,720
man.
It's interesting.

2224
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:10,160
Who becomes huge and famous and who does
not become huge and famous.

2225
01:37:10,161 --> 01:37:11,600
It's really interesting,
but I don't see.

2226
01:37:11,601 --> 01:37:13,610
I haven't seen much publicity on this
fight either.

2227
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:14,690
I haven't.
Zero.

2228
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,700
No.
I mean I'm sure they're going to ramp it

2229
01:37:16,701 --> 01:37:19,010
up when it comes close to a paper view
time,

2230
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,770
but as far as like the history of the
middle weight division,

2231
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:23,820
I mean anderson was the goat,
right?

2232
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:27,470
He's the greatest of all time.
Anderson loses to this kid named weidman

2233
01:37:27,471 --> 01:37:29,810
by knockout.
Weidman should become.

2234
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:31,890
Star doesn't work like that.
I mean,

2235
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,220
he's a star.
I don't.

2236
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:37,310
I don't understand that.
That sounds so good in my eyes.

2237
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:41,690
I don't understand.
As a fan of MMA,

2238
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:44,780
I immediately became a gigantic chris
weidman fan.

2239
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:47,390
I was already a chris weidman fan.
Here's,

2240
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,910
here's the scary shit on that fucking
card.

2241
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:53,570
Hector lombard versus dan henderson.
Jesus christ.

2242
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:59,290
Do not blink.
Don't blink and don't count that old man

2243
01:38:00,211 --> 01:38:01,910
out.
You can never can't

2244
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:06,250
count that guy if he,
if he comes to the gun with a scarf on,

2245
01:38:06,251 --> 01:38:08,560
I'm counting them out.
See ya.

2246
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:11,820
See ya.
Clay is fighting again.

2247
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,750
Cole miller fight and bj penn.
Whoa.

2248
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,161
Here's one.
Someone's.

2249
01:38:17,161 --> 01:38:19,530
Everyone's sleeping on.
Max holloway.

2250
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:22,620
Get on bus fighting.
Ricardo lamas.

2251
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,520
Click on that.
Everybody's sleeping on that.

2252
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,980
Actually bro,
take plague.

2253
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,750
Play as a.
Because greta is going to try and take

2254
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:32,370
him down there.
That's good luck with all that.

2255
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:36,360
Take us.
Transition is his guard is I think the

2256
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:38,550
best in that division of about 45.

2257
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:42,690
I think it's the best in the ufc that
nobody fucking throws up triangles the

2258
01:38:42,691 --> 01:38:45,540
way brian or taken does.
That guy is so scary off his back.

2259
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,890
Got to train.
When that guy joe,

2260
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:49,010
it's.
I'm sure it's like what up?

2261
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:50,740
Just google.
Oh,

2262
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,040
and all he does is let people the best
in the world.

2263
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:54,960
star and is go.
You just tRained from there all the

2264
01:38:54,961 --> 01:38:58,200
time.
I didn't know everything so fast and

2265
01:38:58,201 --> 01:38:59,970
explosive.
He's athletic.

2266
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:02,520
I completely believe it.
He got popped.

2267
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:06,250
He did.
He got popped for something to pop those

2268
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:08,950
black boys to him for awhile there.
Yeah,

2269
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:11,790
he got popped for something back.
But let me tell you something.

2270
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:14,730
His last performance.
Click on him real quick.

2271
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:16,800
Let me see what his last fight was.
I forget what his.

2272
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:19,410
Um,
who triangle city.

2273
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,140
Yeah.
Well that's his tc is,

2274
01:39:21,141 --> 01:39:23,010
is one by to last fight.

2275
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:24,750
He did.
That's his nickname.

2276
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:27,450
Triangle city.
Diego brando.

2277
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:30,950
Brando.
Yeah.

2278
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,970
Because then reimburse your thing.
I bet you're thinking of the fight.

2279
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,890
Whereas back and forth from here that
that was the third round fight of the

2280
01:39:37,891 --> 01:39:39,630
night.
And then it was.

2281
01:39:39,631 --> 01:39:41,760
Yeah,
it was the diego brandao fight.

2282
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:43,530
That's what it is.
And randall said,

2283
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:45,540
you know what man,
I'm going to go to strip clubs with a

2284
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,190
gun.
You see how this works out?

2285
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,720
Then use said,
hey man,

2286
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:50,780
you're not John Jones.
We're going to fletcher.

2287
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:55,670
go bless you.
Go to a strip club with a gun idea.

2288
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:00,270
Bad idea or impulse control.
Now I'm remembering the fight.

2289
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,950
It was super,
super impressive.

2290
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:04,650
That plagues weedo or tayga one.
That's fun.

2291
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:07,380
When they told me you got that match up,
I said this the perfect fight for you

2292
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:10,200
because the big name,
it's a great style match up for you and

2293
01:40:10,201 --> 01:40:12,000
everyone loves clay and it puts you more
in the map.

2294
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,280
You know clay,
what's he?

2295
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:15,580
Where's he at now?
Is he's still trying to.

2296
01:40:15,581 --> 01:40:19,460
jackson's or jackson muscle farm.
He's like in his rv and shit.

2297
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:21,870
Driving around nonstop.
It's been awhile since he said a good.

2298
01:40:21,871 --> 01:40:24,120
When I agree.
You gotta wonder how much longer he's

2299
01:40:24,121 --> 01:40:25,830
going to be doing this.
I agreement.

2300
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,900
So this could be a make or break fight
for him,

2301
01:40:27,901 --> 01:40:29,250
but if he wins,
who knows?

2302
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:33,450
Resurgence after cruz favor with three,
right?

2303
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,670
Yup.
I'm just not excited for it.

2304
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:36,660
Why?
I don't know.

2305
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:38,550
Why are you out of your mind knowing
that weird.

2306
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,400
Oh my god.
Can you cite for maybe I'd love this

2307
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:43,410
fight.
I love this fight because first of all,

2308
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,540
I think uriah faber is as close as you
can get to being a world champion.

2309
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:51,840
Goddamn me.
He's on the edge.

2310
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,650
Like everybody.
He fights.

2311
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,160
Like if he loses to like a world
champion,

2312
01:40:57,161 --> 01:41:02,161
it's like a whisper thin decision close
or the one fight that he had with hanan

2313
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:06,790
barao he got cracked and that was a
weird stoppage man as like he definitely

2314
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:09,460
got cracked and if hanan barao cracks
you got fucking problems.

2315
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,170
But I thought the stop,
which was a little weird,

2316
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:15,220
but anybody can get cracked like that.
Anybody can lose like that.

2317
01:41:15,221 --> 01:41:18,040
That's just a part of this game.
But I think if you look at talent level

2318
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:20,230
and skill level,
I go back to like the Michael Macdonald

2319
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:23,870
fight when he fucking just blitzkrieg
dumb and smashed him.

2320
01:41:24,090 --> 01:41:27,250
Donaldson just came back recently,
came back recently and one looked

2321
01:41:27,251 --> 01:41:28,460
fantastic.
Looked good.

2322
01:41:28,461 --> 01:41:30,100
Yeah.
But that fight was kinda like,

2323
01:41:30,101 --> 01:41:31,040
you know what?
Yeah,

2324
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:33,490
I'm going to take a little break.
But when uriah beat them,

2325
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,500
uh,
it really cemented in my hand.

2326
01:41:35,501 --> 01:41:36,290
I was like,
look,

2327
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:39,210
you got to never sleep on this kid.
He's never that.

2328
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:41,290
You can't man.
He's one of the biggest draws to.

2329
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:44,590
He's super competitive and I think he's
better.

2330
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:47,770
I think he keeps getting better.
I don't think he's a guy that's in a

2331
01:41:47,771 --> 01:41:48,670
static state.

2332
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,380
No,
I don't think he's like a veteran that's

2333
01:41:50,381 --> 01:41:51,131
kind of like,
you know,

2334
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:53,620
just putting in the work and phoning it
in.

2335
01:41:53,621 --> 01:41:55,180
I don't think so.
Just gets in shape.

2336
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:56,100
Brings us new.
Normal.

2337
01:41:56,130 --> 01:41:58,060
I don't think so.
To always changing.

2338
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:00,010
Always gas.
I think he just keeps getting better

2339
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,470
with this fight.
Gun guns blazing.

2340
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:05,620
You know what I want,
but I want the fucking winner of this

2341
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,930
light's Mighty mouse.
Mighty mouse.

2342
01:42:07,931 --> 01:42:09,070
Beg for it,
man.

2343
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,040
Beg for it,
dude.

2344
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:14,680
California.
Can you imagine if your riaa faber beats

2345
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:17,980
cruz anD that's a big f and then fight
mighty mouse.

2346
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:21,490
Mighty mouse.
Do you hate money and fame?

2347
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,440
Let's do a dog.
And uriah faber would,

2348
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,530
for the first time in his career,
just dwarf somebody.

2349
01:42:26,531 --> 01:42:27,970
That bigger guy,
he'd be like,

2350
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:32,230
sideboard on shorter is mighty mouth
quite a bit,

2351
01:42:32,231 --> 01:42:34,420
but at pitt he's a small guy,
but he's just lice.

2352
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:37,830
He makes up for tremendous.
He's impossible to hit and possible.

2353
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:41,280
That's what he's heard.
Dominick cruz in my new method before.

2354
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,940
How is that 1:35 and dominic wanted
decision.

2355
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:48,520
Yeah,
but dominic is like got his own style.

2356
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:50,800
If you look at his movement and his
patterns,

2357
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:53,950
good luck finding anybody to replicate
that.

2358
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:59,250
His footwork and his movement and his
patterns are all designed to constantly

2359
01:42:59,621 --> 01:43:03,340
keep you guessing.
You're constantly like being overrun

2360
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,890
with infoRmation of a guy stands in
front of you.

2361
01:43:05,891 --> 01:43:08,590
The less data that's coming your way,
the more that you have to.

2362
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:11,740
You can concentrate on what's at hand
and focus on what you're trying to do.

2363
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:15,340
Smartest guy in the sport I think and
dominic gives you that he doesn't give

2364
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:17,650
you that.
There's never a time where he's standing

2365
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:18,940
in front of you,
just tying.

2366
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:23,020
You
were talking to them and you were just

2367
01:43:23,021 --> 01:43:25,400
blown away or training with them and he
was training me in jail.

2368
01:43:25,401 --> 01:43:27,580
Like we're two white pills.
Like jesus christ.

2369
01:43:27,581 --> 01:43:28,570
Man,
he's a wizard.

2370
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,890
He's a wizard dude.
You're sleeping on poor.

2371
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,730
You poor.
You know I'm not,

2372
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:34,500
but I'm not sleeping.
And

2373
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,440
Bobby Green hasn't been in a big fight
in a while too.

2374
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,770
I'm psyched to see him back.
Bobby greens want a lot of shit talking

2375
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,440
about.
He always does a lot of shit talking,

2376
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:47,530
but Bobby Green when he's at his best,
is one of the best at 1:50.

2377
01:43:47,531 --> 01:43:49,950
So the diamond to man,
it feels like five now.

2378
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:52,340
They fell off just a tad

2379
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,290
and then he's at 55 and connor knocked
him out.

2380
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,020
He got knocked out in the first round by
connor and he just,

2381
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:59,810
he started.
He struggled too hard to make that

2382
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:00,644
fucking wait.
Yeah.

2383
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,200
And big dude.
Those were doing the ivy days too,

2384
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,430
by the way.
That's right.

2385
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,640
It's really interesting to see the
difference in a lot of these guys'

2386
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:10,580
bodies now that there's so much testing.
It really is.

2387
01:44:10,650 --> 01:44:13,970
It's um,
some of them,

2388
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,780
some of them for sure.
It's just like what I would always think

2389
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:21,260
is if you wrestled and you did jujitsu
and you boxed and you kicked you,

2390
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,480
you'd come out looking very,
very muscular.

2391
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:26,720
When you look at guys back,
you know,

2392
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,060
five years ago,
and you look at guys now,

2393
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:31,520
there is a difference.
Like if anything they look,

2394
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:35,720
they get kind of skinnier or they've
realized that here's a big one.

2395
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,510
Epo.
If you can't use epo,

2396
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:39,810
you gotta lose body mass.
You just have torres.

2397
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:40,970
Yeah,
for sure.

2398
01:44:40,971 --> 01:44:45,350
It's a big part of endurance oxygen,
melodion law,

2399
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:48,800
whatever that stuff wasn't a boxer got
caught from is it mirrors that affects

2400
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:53,890
russians are balls deep and
that's what the guy who fought on you

2401
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:58,220
read.
You read about the sochi olympics,

2402
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:01,540
but and how they've uncovered that there
was.

2403
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:05,990
They don't know how they got into those
bottles that they make in Switzerland.

2404
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,170
They're like tamper proof,
but however they did it,

2405
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,250
they're drawing this whole thing where
every they think 100 athletes in the

2406
01:45:13,251 --> 01:45:15,890
olympics were cheating on the russian,
on the russian side,

2407
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:21,370
and the information came from the
russian guy who ran the lab and the

2408
01:45:21,441 --> 01:45:24,260
other two guys that he worked with
mysteriously died.

2409
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:27,560
So this guy exiled himself to los
angeles.

2410
01:45:27,561 --> 01:45:30,530
He ran the entire lab and now he's
coming clean and saying,

2411
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:35,120
well,
our intelligence operatives were were

2412
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:40,121
basically involved in getting clean
samples to water,

2413
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:41,360
et cetera.

2414
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,850
Why is he snitching?
And it's basically out of us because

2415
01:45:44,851 --> 01:45:48,950
there's two colleagues work till killed
because they had.

2416
01:45:48,951 --> 01:45:52,280
They knew things,
so he went la and shut your mouth,

2417
01:45:52,281 --> 01:45:54,340
but he did know he was rushing to get
ya.

2418
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:57,470
You can't shut your mouth.
He can still get them.

2419
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:58,820
Yeah,
and he had to prove that he was.

2420
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:00,380
He was.
His life was in danger.

2421
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,330
Yeah.
You don't think they'd get you if you

2422
01:46:02,331 --> 01:46:03,830
shut your mouth and you moved to la.
OH,

2423
01:46:03,831 --> 01:46:05,360
you made it.
You're at home base.

2424
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:07,570
You touched base.
They killed that guy in dc and the

2425
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:10,850
movies they killed by russian
intelligence can find you who they kill

2426
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:14,570
in dc.
This guy found he was bread with blunt

2427
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:16,820
force trauma to the head.
I wonder how that happened.

2428
01:46:16,821 --> 01:46:17,690
Yeah,
but here's the thing,

2429
01:46:17,691 --> 01:46:20,360
the autopsy,
like they didn't do an autopsy for a

2430
01:46:20,361 --> 01:46:24,260
long time and initially the,
the cause of death was ruled as like a

2431
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:27,110
heart attack and then they found a blunt
force trauma in his head.

2432
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:28,560
How do you miss thAt?
Yeah,

2433
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:33,860
because it's a spooky story.
X eight to putin died a blunt force

2434
01:46:33,861 --> 01:46:37,040
trauma at dc hotel medical examiner
says,

2435
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:40,310
but like look,
when they found him and look when they.

2436
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,780
They actually made the autopsy claim,
I think it was like quite a bit of time.

2437
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:49,740
He actually died from blunt force trauma
kettlebell in the fucking head.

2438
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:49,980
That's what

2439
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,950
they did.
Some russian bugging kettle.

2440
01:46:53,951 --> 01:46:57,210
Then he tied him up.
They tied him up and then you just did

2441
01:46:57,211 --> 01:47:01,680
fucking swings right at his head.
Can you imagine somebody killed you with

2442
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:04,440
a kettlebell?
Just being tied up by some russian

2443
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:05,303
thugs.
Aeon,

2444
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:07,410
flux brother.
Look at that.

2445
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,510
It said family members told russian news
media and november that they thought

2446
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:16,520
leslie had suffered a heart attack.
That's when they put that down in

2447
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:19,200
november.
so when was this article where they

2448
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:21,690
decided that this is really recently as
march?

2449
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,561
Yeah.
See,

2450
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:26,280
so there's all those months that went by
before it was announced that he was

2451
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:31,230
killed in a hotel.
Now been caught just blatantly cheating

2452
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:33,850
on in the olympics.
Yeah,

2453
01:47:33,851 --> 01:47:37,170
but this is a guy that says this.
I don't know that there's been.

2454
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,720
I've read the article.
I don't know that there's been

2455
01:47:39,721 --> 01:47:42,330
definitive proof that everything he's
saying is true.

2456
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:47,120
That he has an exaggerated times that
ran two articles on their front page of

2457
01:47:47,150 --> 01:47:49,320
the New York times is going to do that.
They've checked their sources.

2458
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:50,790
Yeah,
but it's not a matter of checking

2459
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:54,600
sources like what is the physical,
what's the physical evidence that you

2460
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:55,560
have?
The physical,

2461
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:59,880
they're there very well.
Could be a story there that the New York

2462
01:47:59,881 --> 01:48:02,250
times must run and I'm sure that they
checked their sources,

2463
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:05,220
but is there anything that they can hold
up and say,

2464
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:09,930
this needs to be examined because this
is proof positive that it'd be great if

2465
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:13,140
they did see be on cnn.
They don't think it's there yet,

2466
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:16,650
but look,
it's 100 percent going on.

2467
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,140
Is anyone surprised?
No,

2468
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,990
of course not.
We'll novitsky told me straight up that

2469
01:48:21,991 --> 01:48:25,470
they're figuring out a way to move
around these things and that while he's

2470
01:48:25,471 --> 01:48:26,191
doing this,
he's like,

2471
01:48:26,191 --> 01:48:27,024
I always know.

2472
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:30,640
And novitsky is jeff novitsky,
who's the guy who caught lance armstrong

2473
01:48:30,641 --> 01:48:33,330
was guy works for the ufc now because
for people listening to.

2474
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:34,560
Okay.
The golden snitch.

2475
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:35,190
Yeah,
he's,

2476
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:39,030
he's the guy that catches guys doing
everything and you know,

2477
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:41,940
they're on top of the latest and the
greatest and he,

2478
01:48:42,110 --> 01:48:43,800
yeah,
and the government's money and the

2479
01:48:43,801 --> 01:48:46,020
latest I know he doesn't want to admit
that our money,

2480
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:48,840
he wants to pretend he wants to pretend
that it was way less than that.

2481
01:48:48,841 --> 01:48:50,640
He was giving me like a figure on the
show and that's how,

2482
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:54,240
that's why lance armstrong came on the
show because what he's not counting is

2483
01:48:54,241 --> 01:48:57,480
like salaries and flights and all this
stuff with their county is like the

2484
01:48:57,481 --> 01:48:59,820
amount of money they actually had to
spend like on voucher.

2485
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:01,500
So that's.
So that's the government.

2486
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:04,500
So that's the federal government with
unlimited resources.

2487
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:08,700
Spending $32,
million dollars on a cyclist who still

2488
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,530
wanted anyone.
By the way,

2489
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:14,100
god still going after they're going
after him now for $100,000,000 still

2490
01:49:14,101 --> 01:49:17,900
because he's defrauded the government of
how much they paid him because he,

2491
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:21,290
he raced for the post office,
keeps the ship.

2492
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:23,160
You raise your tax dollars.
But here's the thing,

2493
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:25,590
if you race for the post office,
the post office is the government.

2494
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:28,200
So they charge you for three times what
you took.

2495
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:31,320
So if you took 33,
they're charging them for a million

2496
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:32,800
calls.
It tyranny.

2497
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,120
Riding a bike.
Yeah.

2498
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:36,480
Thirty three.
They go after him for 100 letters,

2499
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:38,040
write a letter to the government,
see what happens.

2500
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:42,240
He's the ultimate golden snitch.
Why you say golden snitch was the golden

2501
01:49:42,241 --> 01:49:45,030
because he's at another level just.
But he's not a snItch.

2502
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:48,340
He's an investigator.
He's not to involve a snitch.

2503
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:50,840
Will be victor conte.
Victor conte is a snitch.

2504
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:54,280
He got to content on top.
But he didn't even rat on people.

2505
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:55,990
When he got caught you.
He can't even call him a snitch.

2506
01:49:56,230 --> 01:50:01,120
You call them a post operative because
he lived on rats where I come from,

2507
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:01,990
but he's.
See,

2508
01:50:01,991 --> 01:50:04,450
here's the thing.
He used to be involved in it.

2509
01:50:04,451 --> 01:50:06,820
He's not involved in anymore.
Now he's going after people who are

2510
01:50:06,821 --> 01:50:08,680
involved with it.
So what is that?

2511
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:12,050
That's like an informer.
But can I ask you a question?

2512
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:14,230
Did they ever actually.
Jamie says,

2513
01:50:14,231 --> 01:50:16,030
yes.
Joe did to kind of be a snitch because

2514
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:18,280
he's really revealing all this
backstory,

2515
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:23,170
but he could be reforMed and since
you're primarily concentrates on combat

2516
01:50:23,171 --> 01:50:25,510
sports athletes,
you could see him as a.

2517
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:30,940
He's helping people like he'S keeping
people from cheating content or content.

2518
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,860
Could you see it that way?

2519
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:34,870
Sure,
but he benefited.

2520
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:39,280
The reason why he has a name reasonably
get so big is because he was helping so

2521
01:50:39,281 --> 01:50:42,100
many big name athletes and then now he's
against it,

2522
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:45,010
but should that can be affected?
Who's helping all those big name

2523
01:50:45,011 --> 01:50:48,070
athletes could,
should that disclude him from being able

2524
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:51,850
to realize the error of his ways and
make an attempt to try to clean up the

2525
01:50:51,851 --> 01:50:53,110
sport?
Is that possible?

2526
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,550
It's possible.
It's possible.

2527
01:50:54,551 --> 01:50:56,930
Right and possible.
That's how I hope to look at it.

2528
01:50:56,931 --> 01:51:01,931
If they ever find physical evidence,
physical evidence test that that showed

2529
01:51:02,651 --> 01:51:05,930
that lance armstrong actually cheated,
has never commented,

2530
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:08,590
so 500 tests or whatever it was,
whatever it was,

2531
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,090
he never.
He passed all of them.

2532
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,100
Thirty $2,
million dollars later,

2533
01:51:12,101 --> 01:51:15,700
but finally he admits that he used
performance enhancing drugs to oprah.

2534
01:51:16,290 --> 01:51:19,690
Yeah,
but it's very interesting to me.

2535
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,110
What do you think the beneFit of that
was,

2536
01:51:23,111 --> 01:51:26,230
and I do think that there's a benefit to
going after people who are cheating,

2537
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:28,420
who are trying to change the playing
field.

2538
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:31,030
I know everybody does.
I know everybody does,

2539
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,860
but it's an.
It's a.

2540
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:34,720
It's a difficult thing because.
Well,

2541
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:36,280
first of all,
it's not an american game.

2542
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,700
You're in another country,
so you're,

2543
01:51:38,701 --> 01:51:41,940
you're giving someone some sort of a.
You're,

2544
01:51:41,941 --> 01:51:45,100
you're investigating them being involved
in something that's not even taking

2545
01:51:45,101 --> 01:51:48,700
place on american soil.
So that's the dubious right there.

2546
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:51,730
Second of all you are saying as the post
office,

2547
01:51:51,731 --> 01:51:54,340
you're suing this guy for all the money
that he made while he was cheating and

2548
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:57,310
using drugs.
If you don't know that cyclists are

2549
01:51:57,311 --> 01:51:59,050
cheating,
what the fuck are you doing in the

2550
01:51:59,051 --> 01:52:02,440
cyclist business?
Because I know I'm a comedian living in

2551
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:04,310
la and I know they're all cheating
exact,

2552
01:52:04,311 --> 01:52:09,311
so I know how much did he do for the us
postal office and also a lot of cycling.

2553
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:12,580
Cycling to lance I'm sure started
kicking ass.

2554
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:14,320
Correct.
And how much money did you raise for all

2555
01:52:14,321 --> 01:52:15,550
this cancer?
We have a lot.

2556
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:17,640
How Many people were running those
yellow wristband?

2557
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,220
But,
but that doesn't disclose the,

2558
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:22,150
here's the issue.
This is where he fucked up.

2559
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:25,480
He Sued a bunch of people that were
telling the truth and he uses money.

2560
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,990
That's where he fucked up.
That's,

2561
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:28,700
that's where he's a bad guy at that
point.

2562
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:31,720
But also in his spoil,
you have to go down to 15th place.

2563
01:52:31,721 --> 01:52:33,760
They were all doing it.
The level playing field.

2564
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:37,570
Right?
So it was about everybody was ratting on

2565
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:38,750
everybody.
They were,

2566
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,930
they got caught.
They were giving people up,

2567
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:44,080
there was a lot of that going on.
And lance armstrong starts suing people

2568
01:52:44,081 --> 01:52:44,950
when they given up him.

2569
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,140
That is where people have an issue with
it.

2570
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:51,180
And when his mind was touching himself,
right.

2571
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:53,570
And um,
I can see both sides,

2572
01:52:53,571 --> 01:52:54,740
but I'm with lance armstrong,
like,

2573
01:52:54,741 --> 01:52:56,180
dude,
you're a snitch on me.

2574
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:58,190
I gotta protect myself too.
Exactly.

2575
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:01,430
I started at first snitching on me and
the stitching.

2576
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:03,410
If,
if we're boys,

2577
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:06,400
the snitching is worse than the lawsuit
by far.

2578
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,030
Especially was a team.
Yes,

2579
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:10,550
we represent America,
but some of those guys weren't his boys

2580
01:53:10,551 --> 01:53:11,900
anymore.
They didn't like them anymore.

2581
01:53:11,901 --> 01:53:13,550
So why snitch?
Very few people like.

2582
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:15,290
Did you get anything out of it?
You.

2583
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:18,020
I'm with you
the word,

2584
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:20,600
but a lot of people,
a lot of people didn't like and lance

2585
01:53:20,601 --> 01:53:23,150
armstrong,
they disliked the same reason why they

2586
01:53:23,151 --> 01:53:25,170
don't like fucking Michael Jordan.
Let me tell you something about

2587
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:28,310
armstrong was on the podcast.
He wanted her to know what number the

2588
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:29,660
podcast had gotten up to.

2589
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:32,240
What's it up to his up number one yet
because it was like number two in the

2590
01:53:32,241 --> 01:53:33,680
country.
Tell me what hits number one.

2591
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:35,230
I'm going to hit number one in the
country.

2592
01:53:35,231 --> 01:53:37,960
I to let them know how many downloads
getting he wants.

2593
01:53:37,961 --> 01:53:40,340
He wants to know has it gotten more than
other people's downloads?

2594
01:53:40,341 --> 01:53:41,270
Like he's.
He goes,

2595
01:53:41,271 --> 01:53:41,880
I'm real quick,
easy,

2596
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,280
open about.
He laughs about it.

2597
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:44,630
He's like,
I'm fucking competitive.

2598
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:45,920
Like you know me,
I'm competitive.

2599
01:53:45,921 --> 01:53:46,910
Like he's,
he wants to.

2600
01:53:46,911 --> 01:53:48,890
He wanted to have the number one podcast
of all time.

2601
01:53:48,891 --> 01:53:50,480
I don't think that way.
Fuck,

2602
01:53:50,481 --> 01:53:53,480
I wish that's why you're not lance
armstrong bitch sway.

2603
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,620
Just wrestled in high school though.
Jitsu with henzel gracie.

2604
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:59,120
I got my pay.
You got your.

2605
01:53:59,121 --> 01:54:00,800
what?
I thought you said.

2606
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:02,660
Yeah.
You know I never said that.

2607
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,470
Wait a minute.
Never to see.

2608
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:05,870
We have to go back to the audience.

2609
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,990
I didn't want to touch on.
I never said that holder in my life.

2610
01:54:08,991 --> 01:54:10,330
did he say he has?
No,

2611
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:12,110
I've never said that.
I'm so confused.

2612
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:13,580
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?

2613
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:14,960
I don't lie.
Wait a minute.

2614
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:18,860
There's lies and then there are lies
that anybody has said.

2615
01:54:18,861 --> 01:54:21,410
They're a purple belt is a liar.
I'm a liar,

2616
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:22,940
but I'm not a liar.
You know what I mean?

2617
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,670
You definitely didn't say you're a
purple belt.

2618
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:26,150
Oh,
I never said it was a purple

2619
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:27,350
accidentally.
Once.

2620
01:54:27,351 --> 01:54:28,750
A little bit drunk.
I never even said it.

2621
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:31,090
Tapped a purple truck.
ProbablY did once.

2622
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,500
Saying b is the reason why he's lance
armstrong,

2623
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:37,580
because these can be competitive at
everything.

2624
01:54:37,581 --> 01:54:39,790
Anyone who's an ultra winter you just
said,

2625
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:41,080
I wish I was like that.
I'm not.

2626
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:45,530
why would you wish you would like you
are going to be a cyclist?

2627
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:46,371
No,
dude.

2628
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:50,060
What you want to be,
what you are is a guy who always wants

2629
01:54:50,061 --> 01:54:51,860
to be something other than you.
ExActly,

2630
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:54,290
and that's paRt of the fun being around.
Brian.

2631
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:58,580
I wish it was that guy and then you'd go
into this romanticized version with that

2632
01:54:58,581 --> 01:55:01,010
guy is as well.
That guy lives liviNg in austin and

2633
01:55:01,011 --> 01:55:02,330
people throw an exit his house.
Yeah.

2634
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:07,400
CAn't post sociAl media and I hate.
It's sort of relaxing a bit now,

2635
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:10,610
but I mean look to when,
when the storm comes your way,

2636
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,520
like when you get in trouble for
something along those lines,

2637
01:55:13,521 --> 01:55:17,540
the storm of being a national disgrace
and you know,

2638
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:21,170
and someone who everyone's selling green
and there's so much going on with the

2639
01:55:21,171 --> 01:55:24,470
lawsuits and the and he's still involved
in a lawsuit with the post office.

2640
01:55:24,471 --> 01:55:29,090
Like the storm of pressure and stress is
probably overwhelming and never end,

2641
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:33,980
but also gives everyone now have voice
on social media who's never done shit in

2642
01:55:33,981 --> 01:55:37,820
their lives to fucking contribute and
try and shit on lance armstrong where

2643
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:39,860
the greatest athletes of all time,
oh fuck,

2644
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,070
damn,
fuck with this guy.

2645
01:55:41,071 --> 01:55:43,950
And then you post thIs a picture of your
kids at christmas.

2646
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,020
Oh fuck these kids.
Where's their steroid?

2647
01:55:46,021 --> 01:55:49,830
That man me feel better about yourself.
He's still killing it.

2648
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:52,110
He's still living in a mansion.
Yeah,

2649
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:56,040
I mean it's just part of the program.
So it comes to the program and I don't

2650
01:55:56,041 --> 01:55:58,800
think he's a bad guy.
It was amazing talking tO them.

2651
01:55:58,801 --> 01:56:00,360
A great podcast.
I listened to it.

2652
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:02,250
He's my buddy now.
We text each other bazaars,

2653
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,140
floss,
and I get a text every now and then from

2654
01:56:04,141 --> 01:56:07,020
lance armstrong.
When dan bilzerian,

2655
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:11,550
when dan bilzerian was doing that bet.
He's doing a bet where he rode a bike to

2656
01:56:11,551 --> 01:56:12,930
las vegas.
I didn't see it.

2657
01:56:12,990 --> 01:56:13,621
Yeah.
Well he.

2658
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:16,080
I don't know if he's talked about it
publicly.

2659
01:56:16,081 --> 01:56:18,270
I don't know if he's talked about the
fact that he did it.

2660
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,561
Anyway.
He,

2661
01:56:19,561 --> 01:56:21,900
uh,
lance armstrong texted me and he's like,

2662
01:56:21,901 --> 01:56:23,490
you know,
dan bilzerian hook us up.

2663
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,170
I want to help them.
Some fuckIng.

2664
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:28,380
Lance armstrong helped dan bilzerian
trained for this thing where he's got a

2665
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:31,020
ride to vegas and 30 hours it like,
you could totally do it.

2666
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:33,240
It's totally doable.
Aaron make his money.

2667
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:35,400
That's a good question.
I don't know.

2668
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:39,720
I think his parents had money because he
was going,

2669
01:56:39,721 --> 01:56:42,120
what I know from the internet is there
saying,

2670
01:56:42,690 --> 01:56:44,550
I love what you do that with air quotes,
internet

2671
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:51,920
underworld.
He was playing that he has all this

2672
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:53,220
money,
all this stuff from being one of these

2673
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:56,340
top poker players in the world.
But It came out that he comes from a lot

2674
01:56:56,341 --> 01:56:59,410
of money on this lifestyle,
like,

2675
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:02,080
you know,
lIke shooting guns with this color and

2676
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:04,650
blah blah was drafting against the
rules.

2677
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,440
He wasn't allowed to draft.
That's what I did most of the trip I

2678
01:57:07,441 --> 01:57:09,210
think is behind a van like that.

2679
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:12,000
Oh,
where someone drove the van.

2680
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:14,080
Well,
his beard is a major air drag.

2681
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:15,090
Yeah.
Well,

2682
01:57:15,091 --> 01:57:17,580
that's a big deal.
I don't know if it wasn't within the

2683
01:57:17,581 --> 01:57:19,110
rules.
Maybe you should have set the rules

2684
01:57:19,111 --> 01:57:21,810
before they made that,
especially if the wind is headed his

2685
01:57:21,811 --> 01:57:24,780
face.
If the wind that y'all got hustled,

2686
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,820
the whim is headed towards his face,
but you know what,

2687
01:57:26,821 --> 01:57:29,670
if they didn't put that in the rules,
they fucked up because bilzerian is a

2688
01:57:29,671 --> 01:57:32,460
smart bitch and look what he's got to.
The vans back.

2689
01:57:32,461 --> 01:57:35,160
Doors are open so they could have a fan
blowing on him.

2690
01:57:35,161 --> 01:57:37,440
But like mr and shit,
he's a pimp.

2691
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:41,010
How do you not love that guy?
Every picture he takes got 100 whores

2692
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:43,560
with him.
It does say I say that with all love,

2693
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:48,620
all love and respect.
Humans private jets and say he has 100

2694
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:50,550
beautiful women with them because that's
what he does,

2695
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:53,150
but that's kind of his persona.

2696
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,840
Charlie's angels.
It's a lot of work.

2697
01:57:54,841 --> 01:57:55,850
I don't know.
Yeah,

2698
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,980
actually it is worth kind of like
dilating out a little bit.

2699
01:57:58,981 --> 01:58:00,150
Like,
I don't know,

2700
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:04,740
it's just not thAt inspiring to me and
I

2701
01:58:06,850 --> 01:58:09,640
can tell you right up,
you can tell you right now what brian's

2702
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:11,970
trying to do is say that he's not a fan
of this guy.

2703
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:15,810
He's trying to be very pc because you
never fucking draw the line with

2704
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:18,870
anybody.
I just don't like this culture that is

2705
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:22,050
essentially celebrating itself.
I just don't.

2706
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:25,260
That's not a guy to hang out with.
When you're that happy with yourself and

2707
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:25,911
you think,
hey,

2708
01:58:25,911 --> 01:58:26,950
you know,
I was going to spend met him.

2709
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:30,030
Guy,
my business manager saying spending 125

2710
01:58:30,031 --> 01:58:34,110
k on a private jet was a bad idea.
I disagree with this naked girl.

2711
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,150
Alright,
I'm sure I'd love hanging out with them,

2712
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:39,720
but it's just not that inspiring to me,
but you have to realize that people

2713
01:58:39,721 --> 01:58:42,730
doing this or akin in a lot of ways too.

2714
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:46,180
Gangsta rappers like what they're doing
is putting out an image.

2715
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:51,181
That image becomes popular.
That popular image equates to millions

2716
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,880
and millions of followers on instagram
because he's manipulated the media.

2717
01:58:53,881 --> 01:58:56,830
Yes to all and he can,
but he can use that to promote himself

2718
01:58:56,831 --> 01:59:00,370
and all sorts of different ways and then
he becomes a business mode himself.

2719
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:02,410
Exactly.
That's what you do when you're promoting

2720
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:04,690
shows,
but I'm saying is like a person promotes

2721
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:07,060
himself on instagram.
What's a girl's got yoga pants and a

2722
01:59:07,061 --> 01:59:09,700
nice big,
but she makes money all of a sudden

2723
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:12,220
doing squats and I'm at it.
I mean there's a lot of those people,

2724
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:13,240
but there's a difference.
Yeah,

2725
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:16,600
look at that time.
What's the difference between a girl

2726
01:59:16,601 --> 01:59:19,000
sticking her butt out or him?
He's got $17.

2727
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:20,010
Million is two.
There's no difference.

2728
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:21,700
You're just saying it's not inspiring.
Yeah.

2729
01:59:21,701 --> 01:59:25,150
I'm saying like,
don't you think it's a little bit maybe

2730
01:59:25,151 --> 01:59:29,560
like the difference between you see a
body that's built for something like if

2731
01:59:29,561 --> 01:59:33,010
you look at joe showings body,
it's built for a purpose and then you

2732
01:59:33,011 --> 01:59:35,920
see somebody who's a bodybuilder all due
respect to body parts is a hard thing to

2733
01:59:35,921 --> 01:59:36,140
do.

2734
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:38,650
Look on there,
but it's just that cool.

2735
01:59:38,770 --> 01:59:41,350
I don't know.
Three is 343,000.

2736
01:59:41,351 --> 01:59:43,870
You're saying he doesn't have.
He doesn't have skills,

2737
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:45,200
you're saying he doesn't possess the
skill,

2738
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:47,590
skill of self promotion,
but it ends there.

2739
01:59:47,610 --> 01:59:49,570
so thing.
But you say that,

2740
01:59:49,571 --> 01:59:51,790
but how do you know?
Because he's also a professional poker

2741
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:53,800
player,
makes millions of dollars gambling.

2742
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:57,460
So they say so is it debatable?
Yes.

2743
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:59,190
Well,
didn't he win this fucking debate that

2744
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:01,240
he won this million dollar bet to go to
vegas?

2745
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:03,820
But he did it.
I meAn he worked hard.

2746
02:00:03,821 --> 02:00:05,260
He worked hard for five weeks to do
that.

2747
02:00:05,261 --> 02:00:07,720
It's not like an empty guy with no
character.

2748
02:00:07,721 --> 02:00:10,390
It might be.
I don't know what might be some

2749
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,340
stiffness.
He might be a wild,

2750
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:16,360
fun seeking motherfucker that's actually
pulling it off as a marketing genius.

2751
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:19,930
If you were a guy I didn't have any set
of skills and all of a sudden by hook or

2752
02:00:19,931 --> 02:00:23,950
by crook or by luck or by fuck you find
yourself with $100,000,000.

2753
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:28,900
Wouldn't you want to live like this?
You got a mansion that top of the hill

2754
02:00:28,901 --> 02:00:30,870
and you don't know.
I wouldn't.

2755
02:00:30,871 --> 02:00:34,480
I try to make a difference.
Brian hang out with people that are way

2756
02:00:34,481 --> 02:00:36,010
more shallow.
I don't know.

2757
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,390
I don't know.
I don't.

2758
02:00:37,450 --> 02:00:38,350
I do not,
sir.

2759
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:41,500
Hold on.
Stop for a second and Just consider

2760
02:00:41,501 --> 02:00:42,460
this.
I want to attack you.

2761
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:46,390
Did we not talk about someone before
this show that you used to hang out

2762
02:00:46,391 --> 02:00:47,260
with?
All the time.

2763
02:00:47,261 --> 02:00:49,990
That is equally as fucked up as that
guy.

2764
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,540
I'm tRying to think of who.
Whatever.

2765
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:55,990
Do you mean right before the show as too
complicated.

2766
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:56,780
Listen,
no,

2767
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:57,700
the answers.
I don't want to.

2768
02:00:57,701 --> 02:01:00,580
I don't know the guy I've met him.
He seems nice.

2769
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:01,210
I know,
I know.

2770
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:05,090
I'm just saying brian likes that guy
because he has skills to be.

2771
02:01:05,110 --> 02:01:06,580
If you can be $100,000,000,
listen,

2772
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:07,720
you can be 100 million dollars.

2773
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:09,240
You know what I'm going to do the
responsibility.

2774
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:14,260
Don't say I'm reading your mind to make
a difference in the world and you try

2775
02:01:14,341 --> 02:01:15,174
and do that.
Now.

2776
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:18,470
I am at least,
at least with the skills I have.

2777
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:19,061
What are you doing?
Well,

2778
02:01:19,061 --> 02:01:22,990
I'm trying to be as original as I can,
but you're not doing that because you

2779
02:01:22,991 --> 02:01:24,580
enjoy it because you're entertaining
people.

2780
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,330
Okay.
You're not.

2781
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:28,150
You're not going out seeking to make a
difference in the world.

2782
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:31,210
You're going out having a good time,
making it,

2783
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:33,910
doing a good packed.
That's exactly right,

2784
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:37,930
but I also do try to make a difference
in the world in my own way charity wise

2785
02:01:37,931 --> 02:01:39,290
and things like that.
I do.

2786
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:42,950
I spend money on charity.
I spend money to make the world.

2787
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:44,920
If you give me a $100,000,000,
had a guy,

2788
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:46,850
but let's be honest,
you're not a guy who's like really

2789
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:51,851
promoting charities a lot and talking
about it a lot and giving money to go to

2790
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:52,850
do is.

2791
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:56,030
What I'm trying to do is go to friends
here.

2792
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:58,030
Let's just take,
let's take standup.

2793
02:01:58,230 --> 02:02:02,630
So stand up for me with stand up.
At least what I'm trying to do in my own

2794
02:02:02,631 --> 02:02:05,060
mind is surprised myself and come up
with,

2795
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:07,080
you know,
see what I'm made of and trying to get

2796
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:10,040
people doing your thing.
That's your way of giving.

2797
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:13,390
This is not a criticism of your standup.
I think you're hilarious.

2798
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:13,961
No,
I love.

2799
02:02:13,961 --> 02:02:15,710
Yeah.
I think you're saying is that what I'm

2800
02:02:15,711 --> 02:02:19,040
saying is that I think there's a
difference between the skill of standup,

2801
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:21,260
for example,
and come up with a body of work and

2802
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:25,640
taken all that money and shooting guns
and being on a private jet and having

2803
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:26,990
chicks.
Here's the problem.

2804
02:02:26,991 --> 02:02:28,280
We know he's not giving to charity
though.

2805
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:30,320
listen man,
you don't know that and here's the deal.

2806
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:31,010
He might.
He might be.

2807
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,480
I don't know.
It might not be.

2808
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:34,490
Who knows,
but what I'm seeing is a show.

2809
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:38,150
It's a very short snippet show.
What you just saw there when he's

2810
02:02:38,151 --> 02:02:40,340
walking by that girl's butt and he's got
a machine.

2811
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:42,200
Look,
not only you,

2812
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:46,010
but here's the thing.
Obviously this is staged.

2813
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:49,520
This is a fucking show is a chemistry.
THe way it was shot.

2814
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:52,580
There's a camera behind him.
He's moving in slow mo.

2815
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:56,370
He's got a bandolier on dude.
Do you not see how ridiculous it is?

2816
02:02:56,380 --> 02:02:58,160
I do stand up like that.
Brian.

2817
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:00,140
Listen,
let's just open minded.

2818
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:02,900
You're watching the video.
He's in a dune buggy with all these hot

2819
02:03:02,901 --> 02:03:05,000
chicks.
Do you think this is really happening?

2820
02:03:05,150 --> 02:03:10,150
That they just get candice,
candice huffine just on on noticed video

2821
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:14,000
of him driving around this dune buggy
with all these hot chicks.

2822
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:18,890
He hired someone just walking in slow
motion with his bandolier.

2823
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:22,490
The girls are laughing.
Is are all rent is a goddamn show.

2824
02:03:22,630 --> 02:03:25,700
I'll be with you.
All I'm saying is even if you got

2825
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:27,560
$100,000,000,
you're not becoming a mother.

2826
02:03:27,561 --> 02:03:29,120
Theresa known here is.
no,

2827
02:03:29,121 --> 02:03:30,970
I'm not,
but I'm just saying don't pretend that

2828
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:33,080
that's the only issue I have not.
I'm just not.

2829
02:03:33,081 --> 02:03:35,000
All I said was I don't find it that
inspiring.

2830
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:35,933
It says it is.
Yeah.

2831
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:38,750
We're not inspired.
We're not saying jesus christ.

2832
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:41,180
Dan bilzerian makes me want to go give
money to charity.

2833
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,920
No,
I'm just saying why?

2834
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:47,870
Why even be upset that I'm upset.
I'm saying that sucking your teeth and

2835
02:03:47,871 --> 02:03:50,690
crossing your legs.
Being dramatic,

2836
02:03:50,691 --> 02:03:54,540
but I think cei or by him.
I was based at the circle.

2837
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:57,230
I know that's what we're calling you out
on,

2838
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:58,610
but hold on,
hold on.

2839
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:02,240
You have to.
There is criteria for how to live your

2840
02:04:02,241 --> 02:04:03,074
life.

2841
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:04,580
There's criteria,
how to live your life,

2842
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:08,480
and I think if you spent $125,
million thousand dollars,

2843
02:04:08,481 --> 02:04:11,630
I'm whatever on looking great and
celebrating yourself.

2844
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:15,770
I just think it kind of.
it's just not really.

2845
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:17,520
Yeah,
it's.

2846
02:04:18,630 --> 02:04:21,560
It's a brilliant marketing plan.
I get that.

2847
02:04:21,561 --> 02:04:24,920
It might not be your thing.
It doesn't have to be your thing.

2848
02:04:24,970 --> 02:04:27,360
It's exactly what I'd do with my.
My point is like,

2849
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:32,270
to me it's not offensive at all.
No more offensive than the kardashians.

2850
02:04:32,271 --> 02:04:34,250
The kardashians don't offend me.
I mean,

2851
02:04:34,251 --> 02:04:37,200
I can make fun of it all day long,
but I'm not offended by what they're

2852
02:04:37,201 --> 02:04:38,670
doing.
I don't think anything's wrong with it.

2853
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:41,850
I do itself celebration and I find that
very.

2854
02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:44,040
I just all around.
It's not my favorite thing,

2855
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,280
but it doesn't bother me saying,
I think this guy is funny.

2856
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:49,140
I think this,
this instagram,

2857
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:52,620
what I'm taken out of this to me is
amusement and humor.

2858
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:54,870
This is what I'm getting.
I see it as a persona,

2859
02:04:54,871 --> 02:04:57,750
like it's a gimmick.
Look at that picture on the couch.

2860
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:02,430
Like to me,
this is an exaggeration of all the

2861
02:05:02,431 --> 02:05:07,170
stereotypes of some super rich guy that
doesn't exist.

2862
02:05:07,171 --> 02:05:09,420
Hey,
he's got the girl me hanging around in

2863
02:05:09,421 --> 02:05:10,980
their underwear.
They're all in lingerie,

2864
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:13,840
but if this,
this is leftover random picture,

2865
02:05:14,630 --> 02:05:15,990
would that be.
Listen,

2866
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:17,220
it is.
I mean,

2867
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:18,540
just think about it.
It is.

2868
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:20,250
His life probably gets old after a
while.

2869
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:21,960
It's taking these photos with this
girls,

2870
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:25,350
these girls,
and I'm sure some of them have sex with

2871
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:26,390
them.
Yeah.

2872
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:31,400
I hope 100 perCent.
Otherwise he's got real legitimately has

2873
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:37,230
unbelievable amounts of money.
Like he's got a house in the hollywood

2874
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:38,130
hills.
How weird is that?

2875
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:40,620
These girls are around.
How weird is that?

2876
02:05:40,621 --> 02:05:42,060
Is it weird?
It's weird.

2877
02:05:42,061 --> 02:05:44,100
These girls around.
Just because you have money,

2878
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:44,953
but you know it.

2879
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:47,770
Who cares?
I wouldn't care if I was handling it.

2880
02:05:47,780 --> 02:05:48,613
Well,
here's the thing.

2881
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:53,020
He's not a bad looking bad looking manly
dude in front of your gq.

2882
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:53,641
Yeah,
he's not bad.

2883
02:05:53,641 --> 02:05:54,474
I mean,
here's the thing,

2884
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:56,340
remember we were talking about the salt.
No bernai.

2885
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:59,490
Yeah.
Who hires these girls and he pays them

2886
02:05:59,491 --> 02:06:04,491
like a thousands of dollars a day to
hang out at his house and he fucks them

2887
02:06:04,831 --> 02:06:06,570
occAsionally.
He decides who he wants to fuck.

2888
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:09,940
He has a whole disco built into one of
his palaces,

2889
02:06:09,941 --> 02:06:11,430
the prince,
and he comes down.

2890
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:13,380
He knew sachets through the fucking
room.

2891
02:06:13,381 --> 02:06:14,920
Naked does whatever the fuck.
That's awesome.

2892
02:06:15,070 --> 02:06:17,640
Yeah.
He just picks the girls who wants to

2893
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:19,140
bang and then brings them up to his
room.

2894
02:06:19,141 --> 02:06:21,990
But all of them are getting ungodly
amounts of money and jewelry,

2895
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:24,690
diamonds and all this shit.
So we look at that guy.

2896
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:26,280
We don't have a problem with it.
Well,

2897
02:06:26,281 --> 02:06:27,720
I don't.
I never said I didn't have a problem.

2898
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:29,010
Do you have a problem with it?
I just haven't.

2899
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:34,100
Don't that
bitches and gold royals royce.

2900
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:39,030
He has like 100 ferrari's.
Bam.

2901
02:06:39,031 --> 02:06:40,290
Pitch.
Killing the game.

2902
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:41,560
Yeah,
but kill him.

2903
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:43,920
Kill what gay is.
Expression.

2904
02:06:43,921 --> 02:06:48,921
Killing the golden jeannie game.
Killing the real goals now for me and

2905
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,390
excess.
So profanity.

2906
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:53,160
Oh brian.
But yeah,

2907
02:06:53,161 --> 02:06:54,050
of course.
Yeah.

2908
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:54,950
But that's the.
You're.

2909
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,490
You're like,
you're doing duh.

2910
02:06:56,570 --> 02:06:58,170
Like duh.
Duds,

2911
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,580
gluttony.
But it's hilarious.

2912
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:03,260
Come up and do doing some shit for his
people though to hey,

2913
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:04,900
hey,
hey.

2914
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:06,830
Might be.
We don't take it easy.

2915
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:08,490
We don't know.
That's the thing.

2916
02:07:08,491 --> 02:07:10,650
That's his fleet of cars.
That's one of them.

2917
02:07:10,651 --> 02:07:12,210
That's his value system.
It's okay.

2918
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:14,120
Oh,
right.

2919
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:17,700
That's
my problem with you is you're acting

2920
02:07:17,701 --> 02:07:18,900
like your mother teresa.

2921
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:23,400
I'm not doing all this shit.
I'm not coming down to the fact is that

2922
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,950
we,
we do live in a culture that somehow

2923
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:29,160
celebrates that and I just find it kind
of boring.

2924
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:30,023
It is.
It is.

2925
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:33,330
But for example,
you don't have to,

2926
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,590
but you don't have to celebrate it to
it.

2927
02:07:35,830 --> 02:07:36,371
Like,
look,

2928
02:07:36,371 --> 02:07:39,250
it is what it is.
It's part of the folly of humanity.

2929
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:40,150
Yes.
I think it's,

2930
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:43,570
I think it's a music or taking a sense
of humor and you should be,

2931
02:07:43,571 --> 02:07:46,000
you should take a humorous approach to
it.

2932
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,970
And um,
I bet you that guy dan bilzerian is

2933
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,780
probably actually a funny guy and a
silly goose.

2934
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,520
I would imagine.
When I met him he was very nice.

2935
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:52,990
He doesn't assume that,
well,

2936
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:57,290
I don't give a shit what I was using him
as an expression.

2937
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:05,830
It's an expression of kind of what this
culture has to offer.

2938
02:08:05,831 --> 02:08:09,640
Whenever you make a point and I see
you're wearing boots and these are like

2939
02:08:09,641 --> 02:08:14,641
a taser to zip up boots too,
and I see that and you need cross your

2940
02:08:14,711 --> 02:08:17,140
legs and has a really elegant way that I
can't even do.

2941
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:20,290
You can't do that.
I know that you can't cross flexible

2942
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:22,390
enough that dick,
you got fat,

2943
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:24,790
but I also have fat.
Let it happen.

2944
02:08:25,110 --> 02:08:27,720
I tell leg,
I take my skinny jeans on it happening.

2945
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:31,540
I tape my genitals down to my mother.
By the way,

2946
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:33,910
I see you're wearing the fucking
stretchy jeans.

2947
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:36,550
They're wearing them.
When you were doing during the kid,

2948
02:08:36,551 --> 02:08:39,160
it's all or were you wearing them now?
These are my five for jeans.

2949
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:44,920
I wear
jeans are my five fours.

2950
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,660
Five fourths.
These are stretchy jeans.

2951
02:08:46,661 --> 02:08:49,770
That's what I will call it a stretch to.
So why do you guys need stretchy jeans

2952
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:53,500
is so good because that's a huge legs.
I you fucking john.

2953
02:08:53,501 --> 02:08:53,901
Oh no,
no,

2954
02:08:53,901 --> 02:08:54,310
no,
no.

2955
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,260
I'm telling you,
these jeans,

2956
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:58,870
these jeans,
I'm wearing sweat pants,

2957
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:01,120
bro.
We both have blow out.

2958
02:09:01,121 --> 02:09:04,330
We have blow out assets and some people
now that cell,

2959
02:09:04,331 --> 02:09:07,000
they call,
they call them like the brand of

2960
02:09:07,001 --> 02:09:08,800
stretchy.
They're calling them like rogan jeans

2961
02:09:08,801 --> 02:09:12,060
and not that I know there's already a
company called rogan genes,

2962
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:14,040
right?
There's already a company called rogan

2963
02:09:14,041 --> 02:09:16,360
genes and somebody made,
but this is like a type,

2964
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:19,610
like some people are selling stretchy
ones as being stretched.

2965
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:22,110
As I talk about.
Here's a strategy too.

2966
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,760
I swear to god.
What are you talking about?

2967
02:09:23,761 --> 02:09:26,470
All I wear now,
so what are you talking about?

2968
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:28,630
I every company has some of stretchy
jeans.

2969
02:09:28,631 --> 02:09:30,710
If you go to the story,
if these are skinny jeans,

2970
02:09:30,711 --> 02:09:33,910
stretchy jeans,
they've got spandex and I mean it's all

2971
02:09:33,911 --> 02:09:36,880
I wear now.
Our chains are awesome dude.

2972
02:09:36,881 --> 02:09:39,860
Regular canvas jeans like keto
saccharine,

2973
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,710
tick.
It's so scratchy and itchy and want

2974
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:47,800
something that's going to hug my fucking
legs off that room.

2975
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:49,570
I used to have to wear lucky brand
jeans.

2976
02:09:49,571 --> 02:09:52,240
Like there's a certain [inaudible] lucky
brand jeans is a thicker cut.

2977
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:55,270
There's like a few different companies
that will make our thicker cut,

2978
02:09:55,271 --> 02:09:57,700
that'll fit my troll.
Like you've got a small waist,

2979
02:09:57,701 --> 02:09:59,350
but big thighs.
Yeah,

2980
02:09:59,351 --> 02:10:03,630
and it's my upper thighs or the highest
where it's way thicker from.

2981
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:08,470
It's all kicking stuff when you do it
like it has a child like developed in

2982
02:10:08,471 --> 02:10:10,480
that way.
One of the highlights of my life,

2983
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:12,820
and I'm a skinny guy,
the highlights of my life was when I was

2984
02:10:12,821 --> 02:10:17,821
at john varvatos trying on impossibly
expensive jeans and and couldn't fit.

2985
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:20,860
My calves are my upper thighs.
They were just too tight.

2986
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:23,430
He was so happy.
I looked at the guy albums.

2987
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:26,430
I got huge caps.
I got cast.

2988
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:27,880
I got the biggest kick.
Well,

2989
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:31,450
they're big for your rest of your body.
He said the biggest bodybuilder I'd be,

2990
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:33,811
dude,
I got.

2991
02:10:33,811 --> 02:10:36,410
I got.
Those calves are ridiculous.

2992
02:10:36,411 --> 02:10:38,240
They don't even look.
Hearts hearts.

2993
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:41,330
He's got this maga,
moose heart that would be a bit of

2994
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:44,300
mousse out of the fridge.
Straight up and it looks just like his

2995
02:10:44,301 --> 02:10:45,134
cat.
Yeah,

2996
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:47,420
he's got a couple moves.
Hearts stuffed into his legs,

2997
02:10:47,421 --> 02:10:51,320
but he's a gorilla of a dude.
When like he's one of those guys like,

2998
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:54,080
boy,
I'm glad he's jolly because if he just

2999
02:10:54,081 --> 02:10:59,081
started just running through a room for
the people even including me to pull me

3000
02:11:00,091 --> 02:11:02,210
over,
I pushed him into a room with a bunch of

3001
02:11:02,211 --> 02:11:06,380
people who are recognized him and I
pushed him into this room and I went,

3002
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:10,340
I'm will sasso,
and everybody looked up and went,

3003
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:15,350
turned he turned.

3004
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:19,340
I tried to hold the door and he pushed
the door and sent me into the street.

3005
02:11:19,341 --> 02:11:20,640
He's a five,
3:30.

3006
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:23,420
Oh,
he's the funniest guy.

3007
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:25,040
Will sasso.
You should have them on this podcast.

3008
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:27,800
He's to me,
him and zach alphadex.

3009
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:30,320
Funniest people in the world.
Just off the top of your podcast

3010
02:11:30,321 --> 02:11:33,830
recently and bum you out does.
It wasn't like he was bombed because he

3011
02:11:33,831 --> 02:11:37,730
was bummed when I was sick,
but the first thing he said is he goes,

3012
02:11:37,731 --> 02:11:39,630
if you're almost burst,
and I don't know why these guys just

3013
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:41,450
don't grab a seat.
I'll kick it in the ocean,

3014
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:44,860
break its wing and fucking eat right
there are going to get weird.

3015
02:11:45,770 --> 02:11:46,940
He's fucking.
He came on.

3016
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:49,250
He was just sick.
He's like on a bunch of antibiotics.

3017
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:53,560
Will is fucking hilarious.
Will is jaw droppingly funny.

3018
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:54,710
What did we hang out with them less?

3019
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:57,530
Was it in vancouver?
We after ufc.

3020
02:11:57,531 --> 02:12:00,140
He's canadian.
The comedy store,

3021
02:12:00,141 --> 02:12:01,290
wasn't it?
Or an or?

3022
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,890
No,
we went to dinner with him at a

3023
02:12:03,891 --> 02:12:07,670
restaurant in Canada somewhere in
toronto.

3024
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:10,520
Maybe it was.
What do we do with a vancouver?

3025
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:12,740
Canada?
Wasn't toronto.

3026
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:15,770
So much fun going on.
Steve over there.

3027
02:12:16,990 --> 02:12:18,490
The little bottle brother.
Dude,

3028
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:21,180
I still am thinking about the show.
I did.

3029
02:12:21,490 --> 02:12:24,950
Joe let me do 50 minutes at the chicago
theater in front of 3,500 people.

3030
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:26,780
50.
That was pretty cool,

3031
02:12:26,781 --> 02:12:27,860
man.
That's pretty cool.

3032
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:30,560
That's pretty awesome game.
So we had a good time.

3033
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:35,300
It's funny how a giant crowd like that
though in some ways is so different than

3034
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:38,750
like an intimate crowd.
Works like timing's yeah.

3035
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:41,340
Yeah.
The laughter kind of roles and you got

3036
02:12:41,341 --> 02:12:43,560
to wait.
Whereas I'm here.

3037
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:46,190
You're not aware of your effect with a
huge crowd like that.

3038
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:48,670
In the same way as you're aware of your
effect with 200 people,

3039
02:12:48,671 --> 02:12:49,940
you have you ever sat,
you know,

3040
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:54,290
what's a really good thing to do is sit
in the audience when someone's on stage

3041
02:12:54,291 --> 02:12:55,700
like that,
if you ever get a chance,

3042
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:00,650
like if you want to see Louis Black.
I was working the night after he was at

3043
02:13:00,651 --> 02:13:05,480
a theater in New Jersey and me and diaz
went across the street to the theater

3044
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:06,690
and uh,
you know,

3045
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:09,770
we sat down in the audience.
We actually got like seats in a nice

3046
02:13:09,771 --> 02:13:12,530
spot,
but it was a nice spot like in the

3047
02:13:12,530 --> 02:13:16,880
middle towards the back and I was amazed
at how difficult it is to understand

3048
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:21,650
really what he's saying once the
laughter roles because when you're on

3049
02:13:21,651 --> 02:13:23,780
stage,
when you're on stage,

3050
02:13:23,850 --> 02:13:25,610
you're,
you hear your mic,

3051
02:13:25,611 --> 02:13:29,120
you have monitors that are projecting
towards you and you're saying things and

3052
02:13:29,121 --> 02:13:31,130
the punchline hits and then the people
laugh.

3053
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:33,810
You have to be real careful what you're
saying.

3054
02:13:33,811 --> 02:13:35,460
Wow.
People are laughing.

3055
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:38,310
Don't miss it because it's different
than a comedy club in a comedy club.

3056
02:13:38,311 --> 02:13:39,980
You can just hammer over it.
Yes.

3057
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:42,630
There's 200 people in there.
You say something that's funny,

3058
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:46,290
they're laughing and you could add a tag
in the middle of it and it makes even

3059
02:13:46,291 --> 02:13:48,840
funny ideas.
Joey diaz as the master of that.

3060
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:50,710
He just like in the middle of people
laughing,

3061
02:13:50,711 --> 02:13:53,280
it'll slam you with something else and
then slammed me with something else.

3062
02:13:53,610 --> 02:13:57,390
But in a theater that's like 3000 plus
people.

3063
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:00,780
You have to wait because when I was
sitting in the audience it,

3064
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:02,220
it occurred to me like,
oh,

3065
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:05,560
when people are laughing around you,
it's like people yelling at you because

3066
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:09,780
you right there in the speakers way the
fuck over there.

3067
02:14:09,781 --> 02:14:13,380
So we like wait a minute.
Guest who's doing guest who's doing

3068
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:16,710
really well with his 10 minutes,
we do our live show.

3069
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:18,330
I make them get up there.
I'm like,

3070
02:14:18,331 --> 02:14:19,890
you're going to do stand up,
dude.

3071
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:23,010
900 people.
Chicago had him dion for 10 minutes.

3072
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:24,300
I was.
I looked at his brother.

3073
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:27,810
Your brother's doing stand up.
He's done this maybe 10 times and he

3074
02:14:27,811 --> 02:14:32,070
fucking killing it and adding shit in
the middle of the act.

3075
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,590
Like adding should.
I hadn't seen like he's playing with the

3076
02:14:34,591 --> 02:14:36,450
crowds and reacting and then adding
something else.

3077
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:39,690
I was like,
this is fucking beautiful man and doing

3078
02:14:39,691 --> 02:14:42,840
this like this without a crowd.
Completely different.

3079
02:14:43,170 --> 02:14:45,420
Completely different.
But you're always funny doing this.

3080
02:14:45,470 --> 02:14:47,160
Just remember what you said and repeat
it.

3081
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:49,740
That's all I do.
I tell a story,

3082
02:14:49,741 --> 02:14:50,730
like,
have different stories.

3083
02:14:50,731 --> 02:14:52,620
I'm just telling stories and add stuff
to it.

3084
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:55,430
But going back to your point about the
theater,

3085
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:57,870
you know,
I'm brand new at this so I thought

3086
02:14:57,871 --> 02:15:01,890
everything was the same and brian and I
went to do the shows like 700 people

3087
02:15:01,891 --> 02:15:04,980
sold out,
but it was a giant ballroom and brian's

3088
02:15:04,981 --> 02:15:07,380
like,
now don't get discouraged because you're

3089
02:15:07,381 --> 02:15:08,940
not gonna be able to hear it as well.

3090
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:09,833
So I'd like,
you know,

3091
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:10,700
do some of my bits.
I,

3092
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:13,120
I could kind of hear him laughing,
but it's kind of,

3093
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:14,550
you're not getting that.
And I'm like,

3094
02:15:14,551 --> 02:15:16,000
what the fuck is wrong with these
people?

3095
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:17,850
We got to the back.
I was like,

3096
02:15:17,851 --> 02:15:18,870
fuck them bro.
He's like,

3097
02:15:18,871 --> 02:15:21,930
no man,
I told you so because I go based off the

3098
02:15:21,931 --> 02:15:23,310
crowd's reaction.
We'll get off stage.

3099
02:15:23,311 --> 02:15:24,060
You're like,
dude,

3100
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:27,180
that was a sick show or do that sucked
and he's like,

3101
02:15:27,181 --> 02:15:27,700
no,
I'm telling you,

3102
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:30,660
you're not gonna be able to gauge it off
this because we've been in small comedy

3103
02:15:30,661 --> 02:15:31,740
place where I'm like,
holy shit,

3104
02:15:31,741 --> 02:15:35,070
I'm like fucking joe rogan.
Amazing.

3105
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:36,330
And then there's other ones where I'm
like,

3106
02:15:36,331 --> 02:15:37,800
what the fuck is going on with these
people?

3107
02:15:37,801 --> 02:15:39,800
He's like,
it's the venue we're leaving.

3108
02:15:39,801 --> 02:15:43,800
Carbs is kind of interesting because
cops is like 400 something and the

3109
02:15:43,801 --> 02:15:46,170
ceilings rather high because it has a
balcony.

3110
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:50,010
So like the old,
the old cops was crazy fun.

3111
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:53,820
The old cops is like,
I want to say like 150 people max.

3112
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:57,690
It was probably less than that.
It was really small and it was tight and

3113
02:15:57,691 --> 02:16:00,060
I used to do it.
A lot of people like dom rarely used to

3114
02:16:00,061 --> 02:16:03,660
do it and take a loss.
He could get more money other places,

3115
02:16:03,661 --> 02:16:06,300
but he would do carbs just because it
was so enjoyable.

3116
02:16:06,301 --> 02:16:08,020
That's cool man.
Everywhere we go.

3117
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:09,810
You don't have all the famous people in
the walls.

3118
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:10,980
I was take pictures.
I'll show you.

3119
02:16:10,981 --> 02:16:12,780
Picture like sydney picture,
like look who's here?

3120
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:13,950
Yeah,
bitch.

3121
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:15,030
Big time comedian.
You know,

3122
02:16:15,031 --> 02:16:15,520
it's like,
yeah,

3123
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,930
quit send me pictures.
I'm always like looking at my boy.

3124
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:21,180
Like you're new to the game.
I'm thinking like selfies with you.

3125
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:23,950
Like what the fuck you dude.
You been thrown into me.

3126
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,100
I think it's funny.
It doesn't.

3127
02:16:25,101 --> 02:16:26,040
I'm not.
I'm not going.

3128
02:16:26,041 --> 02:16:27,180
Yeah,
I know where you're going to pitch.

3129
02:16:27,190 --> 02:16:31,030
And then our.
And then we had a manager go to wilbur.

3130
02:16:31,031 --> 02:16:33,470
Man,
this is this much going as you know,

3131
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:36,850
just let you know where you guys that.
So rogan sold out four times and I was

3132
02:16:36,851 --> 02:16:38,490
like,
why the fuck you?

3133
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:39,161
Yeah.
Okay,

3134
02:16:39,161 --> 02:16:40,750
cool.
And chris rock solid at madison square

3135
02:16:40,751 --> 02:16:43,300
garden,
which is fucking trying to hurt my

3136
02:16:43,301 --> 02:16:45,880
feelings.
It's joe for this guy who deals with.

3137
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,500
We deal with at the wilbur.
Like it's the fucking.

3138
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:51,740
It's a giant theater man.
I'm very aware of what brogan read.

3139
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:55,330
Why are you even bringing that up?
Mike and lebron james dunks a basketball

3140
02:16:55,331 --> 02:16:56,860
booming when you're talking about this a
bit.

3141
02:16:56,861 --> 02:16:58,840
I've done stand up 34 times.
That's it.

3142
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:02,680
Yeah.
I wished 35 only at live shows.

3143
02:17:02,681 --> 02:17:04,620
How many live shows have you guys done
together?

3144
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:06,070
Probably have 10,
10,

3145
02:17:06,071 --> 02:17:06,904
15,
10,

3146
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:10,240
11.
I guess it's going to be doing stand up

3147
02:17:10,241 --> 02:17:15,241
at the wilbur this friday in boston.
That guy right there go on up.

3148
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:16,210
It's going to be,
I don't know.

3149
02:17:16,211 --> 02:17:19,390
We're selling a lot of tickets to
wilbur's one of the best theaters to do

3150
02:17:19,391 --> 02:17:22,780
standup in because it's a three tier and
they're really shallow.

3151
02:17:23,050 --> 02:17:24,910
Meaning the people right on top of you.
Huh?

3152
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:27,670
So even though there's more than a
thousand people in the room,

3153
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:32,140
it feels way more intimate.
It seems like a bunch of 300 seaters

3154
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:34,600
stacked on top of each other.
It seems like the same.

3155
02:17:34,730 --> 02:17:37,160
I can't wait.
You can get some valuable have to k dot,

3156
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:37,690
dot,
dot dot.

3157
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:40,960
You get a feeling like,
like a 300 seat theater,

3158
02:17:40,961 --> 02:17:45,250
but a roar of a thousand people.
I can't wait because they were in New

3159
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:46,150
York too and doing,
you know,

3160
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:47,830
are bitten a New York.

3161
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:49,390
Be crazy man.
Well,

3162
02:17:49,391 --> 02:17:51,610
um,
I took tony hinchcliffe with me to a,

3163
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:55,150
to a boston and now he's going to go
back and headline that place.

3164
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:56,590
He's going to do,
uh,

3165
02:17:56,810 --> 02:17:59,560
the one night at the wilbur and october.
There it is right there.

3166
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,600
See outside that place is sick.
Yeah,

3167
02:18:01,601 --> 02:18:04,590
it's beautiful.
And it's been around the wilbur wright,

3168
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:06,160
right.
Fights it too,

3169
02:18:06,161 --> 02:18:07,840
but that's a bird's eye view.
Uh,

3170
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:10,260
you know,
it's a distorted view of the levels.

3171
02:18:10,261 --> 02:18:13,220
Camera lens,
that's going to be my favorite supplier

3172
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:16,120
has been the vic in chicago,
the big theater.

3173
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:17,230
That's what's called,
right the vic.

3174
02:18:18,090 --> 02:18:20,590
I love the vick,
bUt I think that was a fact.

3175
02:18:20,591 --> 02:18:21,820
Right?
That sounds terrific.

3176
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:24,390
Chicago was nice,
Like an older theater too,

3177
02:18:24,391 --> 02:18:29,391
on soMe big ass place in chicago in july
I'm doing fight where,

3178
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:36,700
where's the chicago bulls play cell net,
but on the civic opera house and doing

3179
02:18:36,701 --> 02:18:41,560
The opera sing,
just start it off.

3180
02:18:41,590 --> 02:18:45,220
Like
maybe I should have someone,

3181
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:50,280
I'd hire someone to sing some opera
opera.

3182
02:18:50,321 --> 02:18:55,321
So who's the blInd guy?
But jim jefferies does opera.

3183
02:18:55,481 --> 02:18:58,500
He used to be an opera singer.
Yes.

3184
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:01,810
The last guy thought that photo up.
That's a really good photo.

3185
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:04,350
That sick.
Which women when we.

3186
02:19:04,510 --> 02:19:06,010
This is the civic opera house.
Dude,

3187
02:19:06,011 --> 02:19:07,780
you're doing that.
You're going to fill it up.

3188
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:12,160
It's all gold.
Look at that prince's room.

3189
02:19:13,230 --> 02:19:14,710
That's really awesome.
That's dope.

3190
02:19:15,350 --> 02:19:16,740
That's the principle.
Nih

3191
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:20,830
horse.
That's exactly the same.

3192
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:25,250
That's the same design on his underwear
on his me undies.

3193
02:19:25,350 --> 02:19:26,920
Come on.
You know that dude has gold underwear.

3194
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:29,900
Why wouldn't you?
You ran out of ideas.

3195
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:31,670
I'm saying right now.
I want some.

3196
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:34,940
Anyone has 24 karat gold underwear.

Come on.
Don't be like me too.

3198
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,380
Usually hide them.
Pp stains,

3199
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:40,881
motherfucker.
Yeah.

3200
02:19:40,881 --> 02:19:41,480
There you go.

3201
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:46,460
I got those are me and that's your sweet
and asked me to do the best anywhere in

3202
02:19:46,461 --> 02:19:48,380
the world.
Even if these fucking dropped me as a

3203
02:19:48,381 --> 02:19:50,310

3205
02:19:52,270 --> 02:19:54,980
I can't have him on the outside and
white on the inside though.

3206
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:59,440
Cameras that will you have.
I wear the shit on my face that were

3207
02:19:59,590 --> 02:20:02,870
trying to spy for.
They want yoU to see what damage you're

3208
02:20:02,871 --> 02:20:04,820
doing to your underwear,
man.

3209
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:06,350
Hey man,
let's go.

3210
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:08,720
Cam on camera and make a jungle camera
at that.

3211
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:11,930
We do.
We do reads For me undies and he's like,

3212
02:20:11,931 --> 02:20:13,770
man,
he's no more life but underwear plaCe

3213
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:17,690
ted talk on the workplace.
Some cool light ones too though with

3214
02:20:17,691 --> 02:20:21,500
some interesting cool prints on them.
All artsy and shit.

3215
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:25,430
They're dope.
What I love about that company and all

3216
02:20:25,431 --> 02:20:27,950
these companies that are emerging on the
internet don't have like an actual

3217
02:20:27,951 --> 02:20:28,784
store.

3218
02:20:28,850 --> 02:20:31,910
There's just selling things online.
Like they figured out like you don't

3219
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:37,030
need a place who wants to go somewhere?
How easy is it to just order something,

3220
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:42,530
have It sent to you and then you like.
How much of a difference is like getting

3221
02:20:42,531 --> 02:20:45,560
things in the mail these days as opposed
to go into stores?

3222
02:20:45,561 --> 02:20:48,350
Like how much of an impact has that had
an actual retail store really?

3223
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:52,010
is there anything in a package like this
five,

3224
02:20:52,011 --> 02:20:53,180
four club.com,
whatever thing.

3225
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:56,480
We literally.
It's like 60 bucks for like legit,

3226
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:59,570
like everything I'm wearing.
Have you done club?

3227
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:03,880
Great wine way cheaper.
13 bucks for,

3228
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:06,020
for really good wine.
So you're right man,

3229
02:21:06,021 --> 02:21:07,360
they cut it.
They cut out the uh,

3230
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:10,250
how everything we do every year,
every one of our sponsors,

3231
02:21:10,251 --> 02:21:12,680
I actually use the products because
they're good to me too.

3232
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:15,200
I love that.
I haven't made a website yet with

3233
02:21:15,201 --> 02:21:16,460
squarespace,
but I want to.

3234
02:21:16,830 --> 02:21:18,590
But the other things like dollar shave
club,

3235
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:20,900
I don't buy razors anymore.
Do you ever used that?

3236
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:23,450
That butter shit,
that versus butter.

3237
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:25,970
Oh my god.
It's so nice.

3238
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,800
We're going to have.
We're trying to get the guy who started

3239
02:21:27,801 --> 02:21:29,240
that company on because he's really
funny.

3240
02:21:29,241 --> 02:21:30,320
Who does all the commercials?
Oh,

3241
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:31,370
it doesn't,
that's him.

3242
02:21:31,371 --> 02:21:35,180
THe guy who started an improv guy
started with some company.

3243
02:21:35,460 --> 02:21:37,210
They don't want to go.
Yeah.

3244
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:38,600
We gotta get them out of pocket.
He's funny.

3245
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:40,610
Well,
I just love this time.

3246
02:21:40,670 --> 02:21:41,990
It's funny because it's really the same
thing.

3247
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:46,010
That's what's going on with podcasts.
You guys don't need like any sort of

3248
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:47,690
account.
You guys kind of have a company though.

3249
02:21:47,691 --> 02:21:49,250
You kind of have fox.
I mean,

3250
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:50,380
not really.
We have.

3251
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:53,480
Because again,
they don't tell you what to do but can't

3252
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:56,720
tried.
Not where they started.

3253
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:57,720
They've been,
but they can't do it.

3254
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:00,410
Actually been so good.
They put this whole.

3255
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:03,770
they know,
they know.

3256
02:22:03,771 --> 02:22:04,460
If they're like,
hey,

3257
02:22:04,460 --> 02:22:05,091
don't do that.
I'm like,

3258
02:22:05,091 --> 02:22:09,350
what do I do?
That's the thing is like you guys have

3259
02:22:09,351 --> 02:22:11,900
an advantageous position in the
relationship.

3260
02:22:11,901 --> 02:22:14,420
It's not like a regular show where they
could fire you from it.

3261
02:22:14,421 --> 02:22:15,520
Yeah.
If they fire you,

3262
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:20,010
you will have zero impact,
but also it actually helped us because

3263
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:24,890
just tell everyone what went down and I
will tell all the fox dirt and I will

3264
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:29,900
blast picture almost
fucking.

3265
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:34,800
I've always been a snitch.
I'm that golden snitch.

3266
02:22:34,801 --> 02:22:39,801
Truth comes out
soon before someone fucking makes a

3267
02:22:40,081 --> 02:22:42,460
photoshop of you in the salt obadiah's
outfit.

3268
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:44,760
I jusT says golden snitch,
golden snitch.

3269
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:48,740
That photoshop seed guy is going to be
talking about what's happened with that

3270
02:22:48,741 --> 02:22:52,130
guy and snitch sweating right now and
fucking put it all together.

3271
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:57,390
Just the golden snitch
fucking salt newburg,

3272
02:22:57,391 --> 02:22:59,190
ny picture was the perfect picture for
you.

3273
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:01,900
Just put your head on his little body.
That little boy.

3274
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:04,370
Oh my god.
It's called.

3275
02:23:04,900 --> 02:23:08,910
He has a little snitch and they do it.
It's like the same picture that they use

3276
02:23:08,911 --> 02:23:11,580
for the golden child.
Use the cover,

3277
02:23:11,581 --> 02:23:14,910
the same font and everything.
The eddie murphy movie.

3278
02:23:14,911 --> 02:23:17,750
So funny man.
Yeah,

3279
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,950
me too.
Arsenio haLl back in the day.

3280
02:23:21,190 --> 02:23:23,400
It was a good movie back in the day.
That was when eddie murphy was in its

3281
02:23:23,410 --> 02:23:26,070
heyday.
Try bringing city hall back.

3282
02:23:26,071 --> 02:23:26,910
Your st joe.
He goes,

3283
02:23:27,130 --> 02:23:27,963
wHo?
Who?

3284
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:30,330
Two thousand 16 bitch.
Get the fuck outta here.

3285
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:34,380
That didn't work well.
It was also the real problem with that

3286
02:23:34,381 --> 02:23:36,240
not working.
There was a bunch of different problems.

3287
02:23:36,241 --> 02:23:38,250
They try to do the same show.
Same.

3288
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:40,490
He's even dressed the same,
doing the same bit.

3289
02:23:40,530 --> 02:23:42,630
He looks the same.
It looks the same.

3290
02:23:42,631 --> 02:23:46,020
Haircut some standup.
He's a real nice guy.

3291
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:48,420
I can't say a bad word about that guy
ever.

3292
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,360
Arsenio hall is a real nice guy.
Why?

3293
02:23:50,370 --> 02:23:52,990
WHy isn't eddie murphy do stand anymore?
I thought he was going to start trying

3294
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:54,030
to.
You know one man,

3295
02:23:54,031 --> 02:23:58,500
eddie murphy has that trainee stuff that
the transgender prostitutes stuff

3296
02:23:58,530 --> 02:24:00,000
hanging over his head.
I'm sure.

3297
02:24:00,001 --> 02:24:02,250
So he's a friend.
Michael will be funny dude.

3298
02:24:02,270 --> 02:24:05,310
When I was with charlie,
people called charlIe out on it.

3299
02:24:05,311 --> 02:24:08,340
There were yelling out to charlie.
Have you seen that?

3300
02:24:08,341 --> 02:24:09,450
He's girl.
Yeah,

3301
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:10,500
I'm sure.
Look,

3302
02:24:10,501 --> 02:24:12,760
I look.
Talk about the golden.

3303
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:14,850
He's got them any murphy,
but here's the thing.

3304
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:20,090
He did an awards show recently and he
like went up and talked about cosby and

3305
02:24:21,121 --> 02:24:25,950
did material about cosby and it was
fucking great.

3306
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:29,950
It wasn't just great is his timing was
amazing.

3307
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:32,060
It was great.
We see it.

3308
02:24:32,061 --> 02:24:32,894
Is it?
Yeah,

3309
02:24:32,930 --> 02:24:34,110
it's online.
See jamie.

3310
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:35,610
Jamie will try to find.
I got to see this.

3311
02:24:35,670 --> 02:24:37,560
It's so good that it makes you go,
whoa.

3312
02:24:37,561 --> 02:24:40,960
If this guy was doing standup,
he would be fucking murder.

3313
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:45,810
I think he just dOesn't care anymore.
Just like richie's absolutely so rich

3314
02:24:45,811 --> 02:24:49,620
and absolutely so busy and he likes
doing movies and when he does movies

3315
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:52,860
he's in a lot of ways.
He's like sheltered from all these

3316
02:24:52,861 --> 02:24:55,320
people that would fuck with them.
He hasn't done in a movie in awhile

3317
02:24:55,321 --> 02:24:58,140
though.
I'm for sure make nutty professor for.

3318
02:24:58,170 --> 02:25:01,050
I don't know what he's done in a while.
I haven't really been paying attention,

3319
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:04,800
but I mean the amount of money that
eddie murphy's made from all those

3320
02:25:04,801 --> 02:25:09,510
movies as the donkey,
he made him a billion dollars.

3321
02:25:09,511 --> 02:25:10,110
It's like,
you know,

3322
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:15,110
he looks like assault and I mean there's
animators and there's a lot of other

3323
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:18,720
people could've done that too.
It's not like it was impossible to do

3324
02:25:18,721 --> 02:25:21,810
without eddie murphy,
but what he has accomplished,

3325
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:23,860
I mean financially it's probably

3326
02:25:24,230 --> 02:25:25,420
staggering.
Same.

3327
02:25:25,450 --> 02:25:29,950
So beverly hills cop,
I could see him not wanting to grind to

3328
02:25:29,990 --> 02:25:33,690
go out when you live like the sultan of
Brunei to bring it back full circle.

3329
02:25:33,710 --> 02:25:37,060
Wonderful to those candles area.
But tell you what though.

3330
02:25:37,061 --> 02:25:38,580
I met him in a way.
He was nice.

3331
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:39,940
Fuck eddie.
Really cool.

3332
02:25:40,030 --> 02:25:41,380
Yeah,
it was real friendly.

3333
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:43,330
Real nice.
Yeah,

3334
02:25:43,331 --> 02:25:44,320
there it is.
Hold on a second.

3335
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:45,370
Go from the beginning.
Him.

3336
02:25:45,371 --> 02:25:46,440
He's aged.
Great.

3337
02:25:46,550 --> 02:25:49,450
Yeah.
Was who has black people on age really

3338
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:50,680
do that?
Well,

3339
02:25:50,681 --> 02:25:52,840
he's in his fifties.
What happened?

3340
02:25:52,841 --> 02:25:53,674
What'd you do?

3341
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:58,020
What's that?
Bill has when you say back?

3342
02:25:59,470 --> 02:26:02,210
No,
because I know it was a big outcry from

3343
02:26:02,211 --> 02:26:03,770
people.
It was trying to get bill to give his

3344
02:26:03,771 --> 02:26:06,990
trophies back
when they want you to give your

3345
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:12,040
trophies.
He's should do one show.

3346
02:26:17,951 --> 02:26:19,810
We just come out and just talk crazy.

3347
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:26,540
I would like to talk
who

3348
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:33,280
that should give back.
My.

3349
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:36,130
Yes,

3350
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:45,780
so he's so good at.
That was edited in sensors a little bit.

3351
02:26:45,990 --> 02:26:47,470
Yeah.
Obviously I'm looking at all this.

3352
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:50,280
Dave chappelle.
This is just a story piece.

3353
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:52,940
Murphy makes cosby jokes at award
ceremonies.

3354
02:26:52,941 --> 02:26:54,720
They didn't want to do the whole thing
anyway.

3355
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:57,420
You guys can find it.
I'm sure it was the name of the award

3356
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:00,240
from the mark twain award from earlier
this year.

3357
02:27:00,390 --> 02:27:01,410
I'm telling you,
man,

3358
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:04,020
I just looking at that thing right there
when you're talking about.

3359
02:27:04,021 --> 02:27:08,230
The guy hasn't done standup in forever
and he just goes up there and murders it

3360
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:11,670
like that and is imperfect form.
His timing is perfect.

3361
02:27:12,270 --> 02:27:14,650
He's a fucking fantastic standup,
huh?

3362
02:27:15,390 --> 02:27:16,320
Amazing.
Unbelievable.

3363
02:27:16,321 --> 02:27:18,510
Taisha pell would act crazy.
Run to again.

3364
02:27:18,511 --> 02:27:20,910
Now I see him all the time.
I see on your instagram.

3365
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,680
Yeah.
We hang out at the comedy store all the

3366
02:27:22,681 --> 02:27:23,420
time.
He's your boy.

3367
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:24,210
He's always there.

3368
02:27:24,210 --> 02:27:26,910
He took me some eyes wide shut party in
the middle of the hollywood hills,

3369
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:29,430
but you had a.
You had to get in an elevator and go to

3370
02:27:29,431 --> 02:27:30,740
the top of this hill.
Yeah,

3371
02:27:30,770 --> 02:27:33,180
it was.
Naomi campbell had his birthday party

3372
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:35,310
and so dave's like,
hey joe,

3373
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:37,830
you want to go with me to this party?
And I'm like,

3374
02:27:37,831 --> 02:27:38,550
dude,
I don't.

3375
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:41,940
I don't like going to those parties.
I liked avoiding celebrity things.

3376
02:27:41,941 --> 02:27:42,240
Like,
oh,

3377
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:44,640
come on man,
I got to be back here by midnight

3378
02:27:44,641 --> 02:27:45,780
anyway.
And I go,

3379
02:27:45,781 --> 02:27:48,150
all right,
so we're looking crazy amounts of weed.

3380
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,130
Fuck we,
we get my porsche will

3381
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:56,190
go up to the top of this hill,
get even more baked.

3382
02:27:56,610 --> 02:28:00,210
Go get,
get in a shuttle that takes you up to

3383
02:28:00,211 --> 02:28:04,890
this dude's house.
And some dude who has the sickest house

3384
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:09,120
at the top of the hollywood hill.
It's just some crazy billionaire

3385
02:28:09,121 --> 02:28:12,450
character who has a sick house and then
above is sick house.

3386
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:16,320
He has a sick party house type.
He has just a party house.

3387
02:28:16,321 --> 02:28:21,060
So you go to the top of this house and
he has this fucking insane view.

3388
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:23,300
The city where it looks like blade
runner,

3389
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:28,130
you know,
and he's got 180 degrees of windows is

3390
02:28:28,131 --> 02:28:32,150
party house is like a,
like a flying saucer that just got stuck

3391
02:28:32,151 --> 02:28:35,720
in the side of a building,
but the whole outside edge of the flying

3392
02:28:35,721 --> 02:28:38,930
saucer is all windows.
So you're sitting there,

3393
02:28:38,931 --> 02:28:41,980
there's all seats around the windows and
then he has this big bar and as I mean

3394
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:46,670
the guy's just closes all loaded and we
have to take an elevator,

3395
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:50,720
like a foreperson elevator openair
elevator that goes up the side of the

3396
02:28:50,721 --> 02:28:53,810
hill and as we're going up the side of
the hill and naomi campbell's naked

3397
02:28:53,811 --> 02:28:57,860
photo is 40,
50 feet tall and I'm not kidding,

3398
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:01,610
I'm not exaggerating,
it's just enormous naked photo of naomi

3399
02:29:01,611 --> 02:29:04,760
campbell and then we'd get up to the top
and it's like fucking to me more is

3400
02:29:04,761 --> 02:29:06,920
there and I'm saying hi To lenny
kravitz.

3401
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:08,930
I'm like,
this is so strange.

3402
02:29:08,931 --> 02:29:13,520
So high plus barbecue
barbecued,

3403
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:14,710
so,
so high.

3404
02:29:14,730 --> 02:29:19,730
Shouldn't be out in public and up there
with all these fucking super rich.

3405
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:21,800
I'm like,
What's up lenny?

3406
02:29:21,801 --> 02:29:22,521
Hey,
what's up man?

3407
02:29:22,521 --> 02:29:24,230
How you doing?
We're talking to lenny kravitz,

3408
02:29:24,231 --> 02:29:26,900
like how bizarre is this just seems.
Yeah,

3409
02:29:26,901 --> 02:29:28,940
it seems really nice,
but it was all these.

3410
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:31,460
I was talking on these musician dudes
about mma.

3411
02:29:31,461 --> 02:29:33,750
It was like I got cornered by all these
musicians.

3412
02:29:33,850 --> 02:29:36,140
Started throwing up fighting.
Oh my god,

3413
02:29:36,141 --> 02:29:36,980
man.
Dude.

3414
02:29:36,981 --> 02:29:39,680
People get so excited.
He gets so excited.

3415
02:29:39,681 --> 02:29:41,050
They want to start talking.
mma.

3416
02:29:41,070 --> 02:29:44,300
Got a guy who knows have.
Meanwhile I'm like anything to relax my

3417
02:29:44,301 --> 02:29:45,134
anxiety.
Right?

3418
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:47,890
I'll tell you all the shit I had.
Break down,

3419
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:52,850
whatever you want to know.
Who's gonna win.

3420
02:29:55,410 --> 02:29:58,970
He was with the weirdest part about it.
Like there was one point in the night,

3421
02:29:59,020 --> 02:30:02,780
noemi campbell was for a book that she
has has a book coming out and she's very

3422
02:30:02,781 --> 02:30:03,614
nice too,
by the way.

3423
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:07,490
Super nice and beautiful timepiece.
One hundred percent.

3424
02:30:07,491 --> 02:30:09,950
I don't know how old she is.
She's got to be 40,

3425
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:12,170
I hope.
I would imagine.

3426
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:17,010
Closer to fIfty really?
Because it on the backside.

3427
02:30:17,160 --> 02:30:19,730
Crawford is 50 now.
I think she's 49.

3428
02:30:19,810 --> 02:30:21,430
I think she's a little older than that.
I think she's.

3429
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:22,610
She's,
she's,

3430
02:30:22,610 --> 02:30:26,240
she's naomi campbell is 45.
How old is cindy crawford?

3431
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:31,900
She's just turned 15.
Noemi campbell,

3432
02:30:34,610 --> 02:30:37,070
45.
Still fucking slamming hot,

3433
02:30:37,071 --> 02:30:37,730
right?
So anyway,

3434
02:30:37,730 --> 02:30:39,740
she stops in the middle of this thing.
They have this,

3435
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:44,060
they have these photos of her,
her book is out and it's this exclusive

3436
02:30:44,061 --> 02:30:45,970
book that costs like 1500 bucks or
something,

3437
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:50,810
a really big,
high glossy the whole deal and she just

3438
02:30:50,990 --> 02:30:54,350
stops and they start taking photos of
her and she just starts posing.

3439
02:30:54,470 --> 02:30:56,560
So no one talks.
No one's taught like everyone's just

3440
02:30:56,570 --> 02:30:58,490
watching because it's naomi campbell
party,

3441
02:30:58,610 --> 02:31:00,920
so it's almost like Michael Bolton gets
out of his party and

3442
02:31:01,610 --> 02:31:05,850
well
my cell phone,

3443
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:12,300
but it's like that.
She's doing her thing posing craft it an

3444
02:31:12,750 --> 02:31:17,300
amazing kid and there's just.
It was a kind of a fascinating little

3445
02:31:17,301 --> 02:31:19,620
party.
It was a good thing to dip my toe into

3446
02:31:19,621 --> 02:31:22,230
and get the fuck out of there as quickly
as realize why you don't go to.

3447
02:31:22,570 --> 02:31:23,403
Well,
it's just,

3448
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,820
it's they're too famous to famous and
it's,

3449
02:31:25,821 --> 02:31:27,860
it's what it is is to me it's like,
ooh,

3450
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:30,710
don't get that famous for sure.
Back off.

3451
02:31:30,730 --> 02:31:31,850
You're going to get weird.
Well,

3452
02:31:32,050 --> 02:31:33,360
everybody gets weird,
it's weird,

3453
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:36,450
they're weird people and they have to
hang out with each other because nobody

3454
02:31:36,451 --> 02:31:38,100
else is going to understand,
you know,

3455
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:39,900
and I was talking to dave about that.
I go,

3456
02:31:39,901 --> 02:31:42,900
do you like hanging out with celebrities
because they're the only people that

3457
02:31:42,901 --> 02:31:44,480
understand what your life was like.
He's like,

3458
02:31:44,510 --> 02:31:46,580
oh man,
but I'm not as famous as them.

3459
02:31:46,581 --> 02:31:48,510
I go hit the brakes.
I go,

3460
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:49,650
that's part of your problem.

3461
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:51,990
You don't understand how fucking famous
you are.

3462
02:31:52,030 --> 02:31:55,620
You're one of the most famous comedians
that's ever lived and one of the most

3463
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:59,520
famous celebrities in America.
Like if there's a 100 list of the most

3464
02:31:59,521 --> 02:32:01,620
famous people in America,
chappelle chapels on that.

3465
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:04,500
I'm not on that list.
I like to stay on the outskirts,

3466
02:32:04,501 --> 02:32:06,480
that list.
I like to be in the suburbs that last.

3467
02:32:06,481 --> 02:32:07,314
No,
jo,

3468
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:11,670
I think you're in that world,
but I'm definitely not definitely.

3469
02:32:12,850 --> 02:32:17,820
So right now you're closing in on.
You ain't quitting.

3470
02:32:17,860 --> 02:32:19,500
Slowing down,
slowing down.

3471
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:23,090
Thinking about moving to like yosemite,
which

3472
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,390
you've always flirted with.
Moving out of la.

3473
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:28,470
Oh yeah,
I,

3474
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:30,900
I would absolutely.
I live right now.

3475
02:32:30,901 --> 02:32:33,840
If I give you one other alternative,
there's a few different possibilities.

3476
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:37,290
I really liked Colorado have always
liked Colorado.

3477
02:32:37,410 --> 02:32:39,300
Colorado is always going to be one of my
best choIces.

3478
02:32:39,330 --> 02:32:41,280
He's been there though.
I liked the people.

3479
02:32:41,460 --> 02:32:43,380
I liked the environment.
I like the vibe.

3480
02:32:43,770 --> 02:32:47,400
I like standup community.
I like the comedy works and I love

3481
02:32:47,401 --> 02:32:48,900
wendy.
The owner of the comedy works.

3482
02:32:49,590 --> 02:32:52,000
That's the spot.
That's the spot where I could live a.

3483
02:32:52,010 --> 02:32:53,880
I could live in seattle.
I just couldn't deal with the winter.

3484
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:56,400
I just think it's stupid.
I think regional

3485
02:32:58,140 --> 02:32:59,730
folks,
it rains too much up there.

3486
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:03,800
Your summers are of the guys and I get
it that you have to like.

3487
02:33:03,810 --> 02:33:06,060
It makes you appreciate one when you
don't have the other,

3488
02:33:06,061 --> 02:33:11,061
but it's hard to know that all I do is
get on a jet and I could be in la and

3489
02:33:11,251 --> 02:33:15,300
it's perfect.
The problem in la right now is that it's

3490
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:18,720
really good like comedy wines.
It's never been better.

3491
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:20,520
Like there's more clubs,
there's more.

3492
02:33:20,521 --> 02:33:22,740
Comics is more.
Inspiration is more fun.

3493
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:27,400
Meaning me and stan hope and ron white.
We're hanging out at the comedy store

3494
02:33:27,401 --> 02:33:29,190
there,
the night drinking and laughing and

3495
02:33:29,191 --> 02:33:32,070
having fun and I'm like,
where else can this take place?

3496
02:33:32,130 --> 02:33:34,830
It's like,
it's so rAre that you'll go there and

3497
02:33:34,831 --> 02:33:37,500
like a guy like ron white drops into do
15 minutes,

3498
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:38,460
you know?
I mean,

3499
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:39,660
that's,
that's really what it is.

3500
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:40,770
I mean,
he on the list,

3501
02:33:40,771 --> 02:33:43,290
do 50 minutes comes by all these word
wall hanging.

3502
02:33:43,690 --> 02:33:47,000
Don't you think if you move to denver,
your podcast would suffer because you're

3503
02:33:47,001 --> 02:33:49,320
not going to have as many big guest
maybe?

3504
02:33:49,470 --> 02:33:52,420
I don't know.
find out who doesn't care.

3505
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:56,100
You know?
I can always fly in once a week and do

3506
02:33:56,310 --> 02:33:58,530
that would get tired.
I probably have a free weekend flex on

3507
02:33:58,531 --> 02:33:59,280
it.
Well,

3508
02:33:59,280 --> 02:33:59,970
no,
no.

3509
02:33:59,970 --> 02:34:03,420
Well I can definitely fly someone there
if they were willing to go,

3510
02:34:03,570 --> 02:34:06,650
I could look for like local people,
but that would run dry very,

3511
02:34:06,710 --> 02:34:09,060
very full on denver.
Yeah.

3512
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:16,380
There's no better spot than la to do
podcasts and stand up and stand up this

3513
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:19,590
kit find better,
but there's also the,

3514
02:34:19,591 --> 02:34:22,690
the,
the vast numbers of human beings that

3515
02:34:22,691 --> 02:34:24,340
live in this place.
Shit,

3516
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:26,530
look at the numbers were denver.
It's not the same as here,

3517
02:34:26,531 --> 02:34:28,320
but how many people are moving there?
I went live.

3518
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,440
It's insane.
Oh,

3519
02:34:29,441 --> 02:34:32,950
you'd live back live in like evergreen.
Evergreen.

3520
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:34,980
I like brunello.
It's nice.

3521
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:36,220
Yeah.
Broomfield's nice.

3522
02:34:36,221 --> 02:34:37,460
But evergreens in the mountains.
Yeah,

3523
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:39,430
that's what I like.
There's some views and evergreen or

3524
02:34:39,431 --> 02:34:40,870
boulder.
I like boulder a lot.

3525
02:34:42,110 --> 02:34:44,740
The bolded things.
It's a one note thing.

3526
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:48,100
Everybody's so liberal.
They're so left wing.

3527
02:34:48,130 --> 02:34:49,810
I like like a little mixture.
I like.

3528
02:34:49,811 --> 02:34:53,500
Some are too soft and boulder from
soften went way.

3529
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:55,330
Just bitches.
Oh,

3530
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:56,313
just.
Yeah,

3531
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:58,600
to lived there.
Just bitch.

3532
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:02,020
How so?
There's just a.

3533
02:35:02,021 --> 02:35:03,860
There's no diversity.
It's just all white.

3534
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:05,800
All white white people.
Just everyone's rich,

3535
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:06,941
liberal,
rich,

3536
02:35:06,941 --> 02:35:09,280
white people.
If you see a black guy played football,

3537
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:10,510
other than that,
they're live.

3538
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:13,360
They live in this pleasantville,
this little weird bubble coMmunity.

3539
02:35:13,390 --> 02:35:14,550
We're in bubble.
Yeah.

3540
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:16,780
Weird,
but super nice people.

3541
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:17,860
Yeah,
they're educated.

3542
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:20,500
It's easy to be nice when you got plenty
of food scraps,

3543
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:21,383
right?

3544
02:35:24,370 --> 02:35:29,370
Somebody made it already.
Jamie made it while working on the show.

3545
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:32,470
Jamie lewis.
Incredible golden snitch.

3546
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:33,970
I might be a young,
sharp jamie,

3547
02:35:33,971 --> 02:35:38,971
please text me that immediately.
Must go on the insult of

3548
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:44,890
the ultimate fighter shop face.
That's perfect.

3549
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:46,750
I don't know man.
Um,

3550
02:35:46,810 --> 02:35:49,780
there's those two spots are big
candidates.

3551
02:35:49,781 --> 02:35:53,260
He's almost.
Well I'm thinking about like spending

3552
02:35:53,261 --> 02:35:55,480
time in more than one place.
You know,

3553
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:57,820
the only thing that holds me back
really,

3554
02:35:58,060 --> 02:36:00,760
it's not really holding me back,
but having a family,

3555
02:36:00,820 --> 02:36:03,260
like you have to take them into
consideration when you make any move

3556
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:06,220
them around.
Kids don't like that stability.

3557
02:36:06,221 --> 02:36:07,054
Some.
Yeah.

3558
02:36:07,070 --> 02:36:08,800
So I grew up there,
my to me,

3559
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:11,380
but,
but I'll tell you one thing,

3560
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:14,110
when they turn 18,
if they decided to go to college

3561
02:36:14,111 --> 02:36:16,540
somewhere and move somewhere else,
I'm ghost.

3562
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:19,240
There's no,
there's no way I'm going to be doing

3563
02:36:19,241 --> 02:36:20,170
this in 10 years.

3564
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:23,440
There's no way I'm going to because I
don't think the city sustainable.

3565
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:27,060
I think the city is like a game of
musical chairs and I think after awhile

3566
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:28,690
you're like,
it's going to be Mexico city.

3567
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:30,730
I've been to Mexico city.
I know what it's like.

3568
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:32,920
It's overwhelming.
The amount of people,

3569
02:36:32,921 --> 02:36:36,640
like the traffic jams are insane.
Like you go through them and you're

3570
02:36:36,641 --> 02:36:37,900
like,
how is this real?

3571
02:36:38,050 --> 02:36:41,530
Nobody gives a fuck about a red light or
a green light and when they want to

3572
02:36:41,531 --> 02:36:44,170
merge they just have to shut themselves
out into traffic.

3573
02:36:44,171 --> 02:36:46,870
Nobody lets you in.
And I remember sitting there thinking

3574
02:36:46,871 --> 02:36:48,970
they're watching this going,
here's this beautiful city,

3575
02:36:48,971 --> 02:36:52,210
this crazy ancient city in the mountains
in Mexico.

3576
02:36:52,211 --> 02:36:54,430
Six,
7,000 feet above sea level,

3577
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:58,270
you know,
just with 20 plus million people stuffed

3578
02:36:58,271 --> 02:37:02,890
in it and like la is not that far off
and las growth from the time I moved

3579
02:37:02,891 --> 02:37:06,970
here in 1994 to today in 2016 is
unbelievable.

3580
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:09,730
Twenty two years later.
Operating values are so because I know

3581
02:37:09,731 --> 02:37:11,590
but,
but that's going to happen here.

3582
02:37:11,591 --> 02:37:13,480
You think it's going to keep going,
keep going.

3583
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:15,380
What's gonna happen?
People are going to wise up and become

3584
02:37:15,381 --> 02:37:16,040
awesome.

3585
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,750
No,
they're gonna keep going to keep moving

3586
02:37:17,751 --> 02:37:19,070
here because we're show business.
See,

3587
02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:21,170
I'm trying to convince my dad to move
here,

3588
02:37:21,171 --> 02:37:24,170
especially because his grandsons here
and so he doesn't seem like that

3589
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:26,420
movement.
well that's different though.

3590
02:37:26,421 --> 02:37:28,390
I mean that makes sense.
You know,

3591
02:37:28,470 --> 02:37:29,920
to live here with,
you know,

3592
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:31,220
you're,
you're here,

3593
02:37:31,221 --> 02:37:32,990
your business is here,
and your family's here.

3594
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:34,670
If that makes sense.
People will move though.

3595
02:37:34,671 --> 02:37:38,020
The thing is it's so expensive to live
here like anything else.

3596
02:37:38,210 --> 02:37:39,950
What happens is people go,
you know what,

3597
02:37:39,951 --> 02:37:40,820
la is great,
but you know,

3598
02:37:40,821 --> 02:37:42,350
this is place raleigh,
North Carolina.

3599
02:37:42,351 --> 02:37:45,260
They're really do with a billion
infrastructure and people move to those

3600
02:37:45,261 --> 02:37:46,710
places of nashville,
raleigh.

3601
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:49,430
Look what happened to portland.
That's secret.

3602
02:37:49,431 --> 02:37:50,600
Got out.
People moved there.

3603
02:37:50,601 --> 02:37:52,790
So yeah,
but the secret's out the winter sucks,

3604
02:37:53,810 --> 02:37:57,710
but as you get like one of the things I
noticed is like I'll be in places like

3605
02:37:57,711 --> 02:38:01,040
that place we were in in Oklahoma slash
Arkansas and middle of nowhere.

3606
02:38:01,041 --> 02:38:04,580
This tiny little beautiful town.
We found the best coffee shop with the

3607
02:38:04,581 --> 02:38:07,190
best single source,
single origin shade,

3608
02:38:07,191 --> 02:38:08,240
grown coffee,
you know,

3609
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:10,880
designer fucking coffee worthy of keith
jardine.

3610
02:38:10,881 --> 02:38:12,640
This is the kind of shit that he gets
excited about,

3611
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:16,010
but
we ate great food too.

3612
02:38:16,011 --> 02:38:20,410
We had a great
high.

3613
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:24,650
No phones.
I know Oklahoma hall.

3614
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:31,520
Here's the thing.
There's good places in small towns from

3615
02:38:31,521 --> 02:38:34,220
20 years ago.
The internet is here and people are

3616
02:38:34,221 --> 02:38:36,800
evolving and changing everywhere.
It's a different world.

3617
02:38:36,830 --> 02:38:40,310
You can find a lot of what you liked
from big cities and small towns now more

3618
02:38:40,311 --> 02:38:41,450
and more,
more and more,

3619
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:44,980
and I think that that it's important to
note that the look,

3620
02:38:44,981 --> 02:38:48,470
the only reason to be in la,
it's kind of retro until I have all

3621
02:38:48,471 --> 02:38:51,290
these people jammed in together.
The idea is that this is where the cool

3622
02:38:51,291 --> 02:38:52,460
people are.
This is where we have to live.

3623
02:38:52,490 --> 02:38:54,830
This is where show businesses,
but what kind of show business are you

3624
02:38:54,831 --> 02:38:56,930
really involved in anymore other than
the goldbergs.

3625
02:38:56,990 --> 02:39:00,440
I guess that's like the last traditional
client about that too and a lot of stuff

3626
02:39:00,441 --> 02:39:03,380
doesn't shoot in la,
but also you don't want to shoot anyway.

3627
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:04,670
There's stuff that you're doing.

3628
02:39:04,670 --> 02:39:06,560
Most of it is you doing standup on the
road.

3629
02:39:06,561 --> 02:39:09,650
Are you doing your podcast on the road
or are you doing your podcast in town?

3630
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:13,880
Unless you're doing dishes.
I told you the story about me turning

3631
02:39:13,881 --> 02:39:15,920
that thing down before the show.
I'm not doing it.

3632
02:39:16,670 --> 02:39:18,710
I'm not interested.
It's not as fun.

3633
02:39:18,740 --> 02:39:20,500
There's only so much time I want to pull
on,

3634
02:39:21,790 --> 02:39:25,740
get my own food in the mountain.
I dOn't want to do any of the milk.

3635
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:27,890
I want to.
I want to hear elk go.

3636
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:30,110
Fuck,
fuck,

3637
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:31,730
fuck.
Waiting behind a tree.

3638
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:34,700
He wants to act.
Fuck you can say that until you do it.

3639
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:36,470
Let me tell you something right now.
Yeah.

3640
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:38,870
You take you bone,
arrow hunting sun.

3641
02:39:38,871 --> 02:39:40,280
You get.
You get addicted to archery.

3642
02:39:40,281 --> 02:39:43,100
I'll take you home.
You realize the rush of taken out of elk

3643
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:44,990
and then eating it and then realizing
like,

3644
02:39:44,991 --> 02:39:47,000
whoa,
all the guilt and weird shit that you

3645
02:39:47,001 --> 02:39:49,160
have about food,
about buying it from a grocery store.

3646
02:39:49,161 --> 02:39:52,220
You can cut out like most of that.
Everything except for restaurants.

3647
02:39:52,221 --> 02:39:54,700
I've had it out when I'm eAting meat.
It's all this.

3648
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:55,813
It's,
it's,

3649
02:39:55,850 --> 02:39:56,683
it's so.
It's,

3650
02:39:56,730 --> 02:39:58,110
it's exciting.
You're telling me,

3651
02:39:58,120 --> 02:40:00,010
well,
and now you're in.

3652
02:40:00,250 --> 02:40:01,380
I'm in.
I wish.

3653
02:40:01,490 --> 02:40:05,820
I wish it was that dangerous.
Do you wish you would?

3654
02:40:05,980 --> 02:40:06,890
First of all,
I want to.

3655
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:09,180
I will fuck you up now.
Go well.

3656
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:10,430
Fuck you.
Out of your mind.

3657
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:12,980
You'll go outside and look at that
forest horse that we've got written

3658
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:14,040
there.
They wOuld

3659
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:17,400
run from his brother.
They might be sweatiNg me with an arrow.

3660
02:40:17,401 --> 02:40:18,450
He's not going to be like.
First of all,

3661
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:23,100
he has to know that it's now an elk
might run a moose,

3662
02:40:23,101 --> 02:40:28,101
might run at you motherfucker.
A moose or the deer or moose or pretty

3663
02:40:30,450 --> 02:40:31,890
close,
pretty close in size.

3664
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:35,550
Mooses fuck people up elk fuck people up
to.

3665
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,890
I'm going to have to watch them videos
and for him to go,

3666
02:40:38,500 --> 02:40:42,270
I need to get more scared.
I need some videos of elk.

3667
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:46,110
They won't.
Moose are more aggressive because moose

3668
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:49,230
have are traditionally and climates that
to deal with a lot more grizzly bear

3669
02:40:49,290 --> 02:40:52,690
ticket.
Now if you're talking about and wolves,

3670
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:54,950
the one animal that scares the shit out
of luck.

3671
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:57,720
Oh my god,
the elk fucking up some snowman.

3672
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:03,420
Look at the size of that thing.
You understand how things fit is big.

3673
02:41:03,450 --> 02:41:07,960
That's a thousand pound animal with
towards growing out of attending the

3674
02:41:08,010 --> 02:41:09,930
machine can bro.
Here's what terrifies me.

3675
02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:12,990
I didn't realize that grizzly bear
started eating you before you die.

3676
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:16,230
As they started getting your ass,
well they don't kill you,

3677
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:18,980
they just eat you.
You eventually.

3678
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:22,450
This was going to say I was listening to
your show because I'm scared of who.

3679
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:25,370
I've always been scared of horses,
but even more now I was just show him

3680
02:41:25,371 --> 02:41:27,090
like Mr. Hanson got gotta.
Look this up.

3681
02:41:27,091 --> 02:41:30,180
I went to that dark web,
found that mr han's video him.

3682
02:41:31,950 --> 02:41:34,260
Mr. Hansen guy.
He likes to have sex with horses.

3683
02:41:34,460 --> 02:41:37,260
Well,
this horse was just a little too little

3684
02:41:37,261 --> 02:41:39,720
too.
Balls deep in that asshole killed them.

3685
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:42,660
You don't know.
You talk about it on stage.

3686
02:41:42,661 --> 02:41:43,410
It's a great pit.

3687
02:41:43,410 --> 02:41:45,180
I stopped doing it.
I didn't.

3688
02:41:45,430 --> 02:41:46,061
No,
no,

3689
02:41:46,061 --> 02:41:46,501
no,
no,

3690
02:41:46,501 --> 02:41:49,200
no.
Mr. Mr hans is a guy.

3691
02:41:49,201 --> 02:41:51,180
He would go into this place.
I did all this research.

3692
02:41:51,181 --> 02:41:53,250
I'm fucking weird.
But there's also.

3693
02:41:53,360 --> 02:41:55,780
It's a three men mission because camera
man,

3694
02:41:55,890 --> 02:41:58,210
the guy controlling that big old dick
cleaner,

3695
02:41:58,290 --> 02:42:03,290
your big old horse winner and then mr.
Hans is like this and so they just line

3696
02:42:03,781 --> 02:42:06,810
that horse up.
He puts his hooves on and then they

3697
02:42:06,811 --> 02:42:08,670
lined that dick into the asshole.
Well,

3698
02:42:08,671 --> 02:42:12,500
this horse was like boom,
son and have a setup where the guys

3699
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:16,590
drove or it looks like bales of hay or
something like that or some sort of a

3700
02:42:16,591 --> 02:42:20,520
platform that they've designed so the
guy can bend over and then the guy puts

3701
02:42:20,521 --> 02:42:24,480
his asshole out and the horse,
they lift the horses legs up so his feet

3702
02:42:24,481 --> 02:42:26,040
are on the platform and the hig is hard
on.

3703
02:42:26,260 --> 02:42:29,940
They probably like jerked the horse off
first payment about two seconds.

3704
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:33,270
That's how animals don't like almost
don't like fuck.

3705
02:42:33,271 --> 02:42:37,020
Like lexington steel and the guy died.
no,

3706
02:42:37,210 --> 02:42:38,560
this was like boom,
boom

3707
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:41,760
noises.
We played the noises.

3708
02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:43,590
We played in the.
Josh has apps podcast.

3709
02:42:43,770 --> 02:42:47,860
We played the noises that it's like,
but he's like kind of like.

3710
02:42:47,861 --> 02:42:50,610
And he's like,
oh man,

3711
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:54,330
he doesn't either.
He died at the hospital,

3712
02:42:54,340 --> 02:42:55,260
the hospital,
his friends were like,

3713
02:42:55,261 --> 02:42:56,520
you gotta go to the hospital.
He's like,

3714
02:42:56,521 --> 02:42:57,121
no,
I'm fine.

3715
02:42:57,121 --> 02:42:58,410
I because he worked for boeing.
He's like,

3716
02:42:58,411 --> 02:43:02,850
I'm not going to know.
They don't know if that video is of the

3717
02:43:02,851 --> 02:43:07,851
time that killed him because apparently
there's hundreds of hours of videos of

3718
02:43:08,131 --> 02:43:10,950
those guys getting fucked by horses.
Hundreds of hours.

3719
02:43:11,170 --> 02:43:16,170
Now my thing is with the government
should do is there's no sense in holding

3720
02:43:16,781 --> 02:43:18,460
onto that.
Not making a profit off of those

3721
02:43:18,461 --> 02:43:19,294
hundreds of hours.

3722
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:22,890
They should take that and make a dvd,
put it up for sale and uh,

3723
02:43:22,891 --> 02:43:24,700
you know,
put the money back into the coffers of

3724
02:43:24,701 --> 02:43:27,490
the city claw.
Make Some money.

3725
02:43:27,580 --> 02:43:31,870
I can check it out.
It's interesting to see because this

3726
02:43:31,871 --> 02:43:33,640
horse is dick.
It looks like this mic.

3727
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:35,920
It's literally,
it's like your arm and I'm not kidding.

3728
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:37,450
And he goes,
he goes,

3729
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:38,920
he goes,
balls deep.

3730
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:39,810
Yeah.
This horse is,

3731
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,000
it goes through his fucking.
It just rips them apart.

3732
02:43:43,070 --> 02:43:44,170
It's tours colon.
Oh,

3733
02:43:44,171 --> 02:43:45,850
what'd you think was gonna happen?
Well,

3734
02:43:45,851 --> 02:43:48,610
apparently had done it a bunch of times
and survived.

3735
02:43:49,150 --> 02:43:50,610
I dunno man.
Or,

3736
02:43:50,630 --> 02:43:52,910
or done it with other animals.
And then maybe the horses.

3737
02:43:52,930 --> 02:43:55,180
What broke them?
Maybe try to put a safety ring on that

3738
02:43:55,181 --> 02:43:56,440
bad boy.
Put a safety ring.

3739
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:58,330
Well,
if the guy tries to hold onto it for a

3740
02:43:58,331 --> 02:43:59,270
second,
who's that?

3741
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:00,550
He tries to like,
you know,

3742
02:44:00,570 --> 02:44:03,130
like a high school girl when they're
first starting out.

3743
02:44:03,250 --> 02:44:05,860
Has they hold onto the.
They have like little stopper.

3744
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:07,960
Yeah.
That horse is not buying that.

3745
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:13,090
Just the tip.
You've got to put an inflatable safety

3746
02:44:13,091 --> 02:44:14,800
ring on that bad boy.
I didn't get to stop that.

3747
02:44:14,801 --> 02:44:17,170
Fucking males.
It's this weird.

3748
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:21,610
It's weird because it's,
it's weird because they've met online in

3749
02:44:21,611 --> 02:44:24,040
a forum where people were turned on by
animals.

3750
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:27,430
Yeah.
And then they met on this forum and then

3751
02:44:27,431 --> 02:44:31,600
decided to meet in this place that was
legal in Washington state.

3752
02:44:31,601 --> 02:44:34,870
It was legal until recently.
As long as the animal's penetrating you.

3753
02:44:34,871 --> 02:44:37,720
If you're penetrating the animal,
that shit's illegal son.

3754
02:44:37,810 --> 02:44:40,260
LIke you can't fuck a horse,
but it's you.

3755
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:42,150
I guess that changed.
It's mr.

3756
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:43,480
Van dyke is.
It makes sense.

3757
02:44:43,481 --> 02:44:46,200
That's like that guy jonathan,
so balls deep in it,

3758
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:49,480
but as soon as I was that I was on the
plane just researching the shit out of

3759
02:44:49,481 --> 02:44:50,920
it,
but there was this guy jonathan haidt

3760
02:44:50,921 --> 02:44:52,450
who's a social scientist talking about
that,

3761
02:44:52,451 --> 02:44:55,080
like certain things are legal,
but they,

3762
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:58,300
they elicit a disgust response even
though they don't hurt anybody.

3763
02:44:58,300 --> 02:45:01,360
So like he does this example of um,
two things where he goes,

3764
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:06,430
if a brother and sister are in the woods
having sex with a condom on,

3765
02:45:07,090 --> 02:45:09,910
there's nothing inherently harmful to
both of them.

3766
02:45:09,911 --> 02:45:11,380
But all of us go,
oh,

3767
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:15,040
or If the guy jerks off or if a guy
fucks a chicken,

3768
02:45:15,041 --> 02:45:16,540
then eats it.
We all go,

3769
02:45:16,610 --> 02:45:19,360
god daMn.
But it's now really the chicken's

3770
02:45:19,361 --> 02:45:20,370
already dead.
It's not.

3771
02:45:20,710 --> 02:45:25,120
And it elicits in disgust reaction even
though it technically you can't really

3772
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:28,960
define why it's wrong,
why you signed to that bit about it.

3773
02:45:28,990 --> 02:45:31,630
But why is it okay to kill something?
But you can't fuck it after you kill it.

3774
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:34,060
That's like,
you can't do that.

3775
02:45:34,061 --> 02:45:35,920
But if you jerked off of the chicken
cutlet,

3776
02:45:35,921 --> 02:45:37,960
I bet you wouldn't go to jail.
Somebody call you,

3777
02:45:38,060 --> 02:45:41,110
caught you fucking a chicken,
people be really mad,

3778
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:44,140
but if you just took the breast,
the chicken breast wrapped around your

3779
02:45:44,141 --> 02:45:46,210
dick and jerked off,
no one can say shit.

3780
02:45:46,390 --> 02:45:47,080
Right?
But we,

3781
02:45:47,080 --> 02:45:51,850
we still have thIs automatic discussed,
weird to like ground beef.

3782
02:45:51,880 --> 02:45:54,960
If you take ground beef and you know,
you just take like

3783
02:45:56,800 --> 02:46:00,130
warm it up to like body temperature and
like a plastic ziploc bag,

3784
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:03,540
wrap it around your dick and just start
jerking yourself with this warm basal a

3785
02:46:03,550 --> 02:46:05,410
terrible.
And you knew that you allowed to do

3786
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:07,370
that.
I guess you can do that

3787
02:46:08,990 --> 02:46:10,250
where people might not invite

3788
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:12,560
you to their cocktail party,
but if you get caught fucking a pig,

3789
02:46:12,561 --> 02:46:14,240
even if the pigs having a great old
time,

3790
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:17,870
I'll give you a fucking pig.
And the pigs like loving it,

3791
02:46:19,010 --> 02:46:19,970
loving it.
Is that,

3792
02:46:19,971 --> 02:46:23,840
is that your big impression pig?
Just really hitting at the right spot

3793
02:46:23,841 --> 02:46:25,030
that pigs like,
oh

3794
02:46:27,620 --> 02:46:29,510
that's illegal.
That's illegal.

3795
02:46:29,590 --> 02:46:33,980
Like even if the pig like finds you and
starts backing up towards you since you

3796
02:46:33,981 --> 02:46:37,310
out.
But if you bend over in that pigs like,

3797
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:39,140
yo,
let me get that at that asshole.

3798
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:41,290
It's legal.
Let's go back to danville.

3799
02:46:41,370 --> 02:46:42,560
No talking.
No,

3800
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:46,370
it's not necessarily legal and I don't
think it's legal in Washington state

3801
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:48,440
anyMore.
Mr dan stein.

3802
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:51,890
But it's not like a proactive active.
It's like it's.

3803
02:46:51,950 --> 02:46:54,950
I think it's illegal to just be engaging
in sex.

3804
02:46:55,060 --> 02:46:55,893
I think it's like,
oh,

3805
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:58,160
I don't know.
In a weird who gives us the questions

3806
02:46:58,180 --> 02:46:59,510
like can you do body parts?

3807
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:01,980
No.
Well,

3808
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:06,380
what about the guy who paid the guy to
kill them and eat them?

3809
02:47:06,590 --> 02:47:08,990
And they ate.
They ate his genitals together.

3810
02:47:09,050 --> 02:47:11,000
They need is.
They stick together.

3811
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:13,640
Like technically there was a legal
quagmire.

3812
02:47:13,641 --> 02:47:14,451
There were.
They were like,

3813
02:47:14,451 --> 02:47:18,320
well the guy did put an ad out and he
didn't want to craigslist and we end.

3814
02:47:18,530 --> 02:47:21,960
You cannibalized him together.
Is the.

3815
02:47:22,050 --> 02:47:24,350
Did the guy wind up dying?
Oh yes.

3816
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:26,510
He wanted to be slaughtered.
Put an ad out on craigslist.

3817
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:29,810
And where was that?
And some dude was like,

3818
02:47:29,830 --> 02:47:30,531
oh,
I'll do it.

3819
02:47:30,531 --> 02:47:31,490
I'll do it.
And he's like,

3820
02:47:31,491 --> 02:47:33,620
listen with the dealers,
you got eat my dick first.

3821
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:39,770
That dick like kobiashi up barbecue that
trains japanese man 22 cooks his own

3822
02:47:39,771 --> 02:47:42,140
genitals and serve them.
Know this is a different one.

3823
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:43,490
This is fucking.
No,

3824
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:46,910
this is a guy who didn't like his
gender.

3825
02:47:46,970 --> 02:47:50,930
He was asexual.
So he decided to cut his dick and balls

3826
02:47:50,931 --> 02:47:53,110
off and then serve them.
Did they?

3827
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:54,360
Did the party?
No though.

3828
02:47:54,361 --> 02:47:56,130
Or is it like hannibal style?
No,

3829
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:59,030
he.
They knew they were garnished with

3830
02:47:59,031 --> 02:48:02,360
mushrooms and parsley.
they paid a 160.

3831
02:48:02,361 --> 02:48:04,850
What is that?
Pounds per person.

3832
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:07,430
Way too much.
Way too much to eat.

3833
02:48:07,431 --> 02:48:10,730
His severed genitalium mushrooms and
parsley.

3834
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:13,760
I like mine with lemon damn paper.
You get everything though.

3835
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:16,460
You get the shaft,
the testes and the scrotum.

3836
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:19,400
look at this.
He cooked the genitalia himself as he

3837
02:48:19,401 --> 02:48:22,220
was supervised by a chef.
Whoa.

3838
02:48:22,221 --> 02:48:24,890
In a tweet.
He offered to cook his penis for a guest

3839
02:48:24,891 --> 02:48:26,260
for whatever.
That's quickly.

3840
02:48:26,350 --> 02:48:27,800
mark,
male genitals,

3841
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:31,650
full penis testes.
Scrotum them as a meal for 100,000.

3842
02:48:31,651 --> 02:48:33,410
In the end,
that's 800 pounds.

3843
02:48:33,620 --> 02:48:35,590
So that's roughly what?
A thousand dollars.

3844
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:37,900
1,200 little asian guy though.
That's a

3845
02:48:39,970 --> 02:48:42,560
dollar less than dollar.
Now it varies,

3846
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:43,483
right?

3847
02:48:43,550 --> 02:48:46,300
It's more now it's worth more.
So 800 pounds,

3848
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:48,860
like a thousand.
He decided to split the meal between six

3849
02:48:48,861 --> 02:48:50,450
guests.
So you're not getting a lot of dick for

3850
02:48:50,451 --> 02:48:52,700
your money.
The organs were surgically removed at

3851
02:48:52,701 --> 02:48:56,060
age 22.
I was tested to be free of venereal

3852
02:48:56,061 --> 02:48:58,730
diseases.
The organs were of normal function.

3853
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:01,400
I was not receiving female hormone
treatment,

3854
02:49:02,150 --> 02:49:05,960
so he took the dick and balls away a
year ago.

3855
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:07,590
A year before.
Shit.

3856
02:49:07,591 --> 02:49:09,480
That shit on ice.
Oh my god.

3857
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:11,970
Well that's probably going to tenderize
it a little bit.

3858
02:49:12,010 --> 02:49:13,260
That works with elk meat.
Yeah.

3859
02:49:13,261 --> 02:49:15,250
It depends how you let it simmer.
It depends how you let it.

3860
02:49:15,380 --> 02:49:16,350
I mean,
it's freezing.

3861
02:49:16,351 --> 02:49:18,990
You freeze it for a year.
It actually breaks down some of the

3862
02:49:18,991 --> 02:49:20,740
tissue,
especially that scrotum.

3863
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:24,200
A lot of guys who hunt moose,
they don't eat it for like six months to

3864
02:49:24,490 --> 02:49:26,130
rainelle.
His brother told him that dick would be

3865
02:49:26,131 --> 02:49:27,480
pretty soft,
like a filet.

3866
02:49:27,900 --> 02:49:30,880
I feel safe.
I feel safe.

3867
02:49:31,410 --> 02:49:33,180
I feel really sick.
I know,

3868
02:49:33,181 --> 02:49:35,550
but so.
So what about the six people in this

3869
02:49:35,551 --> 02:49:38,070
tiny dick?
Like calamari?

3870
02:49:38,580 --> 02:49:40,470
Not good.
The other guy's a different story

3871
02:49:40,471 --> 02:49:40,991
though.
Find them out.

3872
02:49:40,991 --> 02:49:43,260
The guy who hired someone to kill them
and eat them.

3873
02:49:43,460 --> 02:49:44,610
Yeah,
that one's different one,

3874
02:49:44,611 --> 02:49:47,630
but there's a lot of weird dick eaton
people who the fuck signing up to go to

3875
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:49,670
that dinner.
You guys go over chinsey,

3876
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:52,950
but then you call them crazy.
What do you guys know about the japanese

3877
02:49:52,951 --> 02:49:54,750
guy?
There's a japanese guy who killed a

3878
02:49:54,751 --> 02:49:59,640
woman in adr and did a little bit of
time in jail and somehow or another got

3879
02:49:59,641 --> 02:50:04,641
off or got out and now is a celebrity
and he jokes around about eating people.

3880
02:50:04,950 --> 02:50:08,280
He murdered some gIrl in adr and now he
does like pictures,

3881
02:50:08,281 --> 02:50:11,100
like the japanese culture is very
different than ours and he does these

3882
02:50:11,101 --> 02:50:15,210
like pictures where he pretends to be
like biting people's like a scary,

3883
02:50:15,211 --> 02:50:16,740
strange fetish celebrity.

3884
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:19,920
I'm trying to remember the dude's name
ozawa or something like that.

3885
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:22,350
You find them.
I was looking for that,

3886
02:50:22,351 --> 02:50:24,960
but you started almost say,
I found this was even weirder.

3887
02:50:26,010 --> 02:50:28,020
When is this article?
That damn things in the way.

3888
02:50:28,470 --> 02:50:31,230
Oh man,
slices are down at the bottom of it.

3889
02:50:31,290 --> 02:50:32,280
You can get rid of it.
No.

3890
02:50:32,380 --> 02:50:35,400
See the right below that audible.
Oh my god.

3891
02:50:35,401 --> 02:50:36,990
They're all popping up.
This is gross.

3892
02:50:37,530 --> 02:50:39,100
Oh my god.
Look at things that pop up.

3893
02:50:39,430 --> 02:50:41,700
I feel sick.
I feel physically sick.

3894
02:50:41,701 --> 02:50:43,850
Thing he's eaten.
Dick ill.

3895
02:50:44,250 --> 02:50:46,590
You can't get rid of that ad.
Oh my god.

3896
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:47,340
Audible.
Oh,

3897
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:48,173
there it goes.
Okay.

3898
02:50:49,410 --> 02:50:50,880
Oh,
it's like a coding issue.

3899
02:50:50,881 --> 02:50:51,960
Huh?
I see.

3900
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:53,820
Interesting though.
It's going to.

3901
02:50:53,821 --> 02:50:57,780
Things that you've researched like
richard dawkins,

3902
02:50:57,781 --> 02:51:00,060
the god delusion mediator.
Sam harris,

3903
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:04,880
a woman's slices off rapists genitalia.
Forces him to eat it at gun type.

3904
02:51:04,900 --> 02:51:08,370
Move that cool because this guy came in,
he raped her.

3905
02:51:08,580 --> 02:51:11,070
Keep going down.
We'll get that guy's face and then she

3906
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:13,320
convicted.
Child molester,

3907
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:16,650
tied him up and he grabbed the knife and
castrated him.

3908
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:19,770
Wow.
Is that the plot of a save after

3909
02:51:19,771 --> 02:51:23,910
drinking massive amounts of alcohol and
was able to untie herself and then she

3910
02:51:24,090 --> 02:51:25,410
basically.
I'm with that.

3911
02:51:25,411 --> 02:51:26,570
That's cool.
Yeah.

3912
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:29,130
Awesome.
She should've killed chunk in the

3913
02:51:29,131 --> 02:51:31,650
microwave,
grabbed the plate fork and steak knIfe

3914
02:51:31,651 --> 02:51:33,590
and cut it up like hot dogs.
Wow.

3915
02:51:33,630 --> 02:51:36,180
Enforcement gun that he had left on the
kitchen counter,

3916
02:51:36,181 --> 02:51:37,800
walked over to him,
force him to eat it.

3917
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:41,190
I have no remorse and I'm not sorry.
That bastard deserved it and he's going

3918
02:51:41,300 --> 02:51:42,660
to get in trouble.
I agree with her.

3919
02:51:42,740 --> 02:51:46,650
You
see now that's a case where I think that

3920
02:51:46,651 --> 02:51:49,830
girls should get a medal me to.
Why are we celebrating her?

3921
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:53,070
Why is she in trouble?
Find out she's in trouble.

3922
02:51:53,190 --> 02:51:54,730
I hope not be hilarious because she
loves.

3923
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:55,370
Kill him.
Right?

3924
02:51:55,370 --> 02:51:58,770
Just fed them that dick that's allowed.
That should cut his dick off.

3925
02:51:59,410 --> 02:52:01,950
Amen.
You can't say self defense.

3926
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:03,480
Well,
she was tied up.

3927
02:52:03,481 --> 02:52:05,350
Got out.
Cut that dickoff force.

3928
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:06,340
Indeed it.
Yeah.

3929
02:52:06,341 --> 02:52:08,080
He needs to die.
Of course.

3930
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:11,200
Well now he's.
It's almost batteries alive now because

3931
02:52:11,201 --> 02:52:12,970
he could still hurt people.
Good luck in jail.

3932
02:52:13,090 --> 02:52:15,800
You know a lot of those guys.
What they're doing is psychological.

3933
02:52:16,030 --> 02:52:19,000
You know what?
It's fake.

3934
02:52:19,590 --> 02:52:21,550
Damn god damn well that the picture.
I was like,

3935
02:52:21,551 --> 02:52:23,230
well,
that pIcture of jamie snopes it.

3936
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:28,000
Fake news site posing as the los angeles
area outlet.

3937
02:52:28,001 --> 02:52:31,120
Ktlk.
Spread a fabricated but juicy tail as

3938
02:52:31,150 --> 02:52:32,680
shovels,
truman's revenge

3939
02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:37,610
plot from the girl with the tattoo.
Whatever the fuck it was.

3940
02:52:37,750 --> 02:52:40,160
It was
like heaven.

3941
02:52:40,190 --> 02:52:40,720
I seen that.

3942
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:42,040
That rapist,
she fucked them up.

3943
02:52:42,370 --> 02:52:44,630
Feed them as dIck,
but she fucks them up and writes like

3944
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:49,980
horror or whatever on his back.
And then two good move man s cbre on,

3945
02:52:50,140 --> 02:52:51,730
but we're all in agreement of something
like that.

3946
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:53,620
You know,
you see on like the possibility of

3947
02:52:53,621 --> 02:52:55,420
someone actually doing that and how you
support it.

3948
02:52:55,740 --> 02:52:57,380
I'm 100 percent in agreement with me to
brian.

3949
02:52:57,390 --> 02:52:58,660
He checking the tweet.

3950
02:52:58,661 --> 02:53:00,220

You guys have a meeting.

3952
02:53:04,230 --> 02:53:05,650
What time is your meeting?
I don't know.

3953
02:53:05,651 --> 02:53:08,110
I just got a call from my agent.
I may have to listen to it real quick.

3954
02:53:08,610 --> 02:53:11,490
What are you guys doing?
Business.

3955
02:53:11,990 --> 02:53:16,030
a big shot in the streets right now.
Victim of cannibal agreed to be eating.

3956
02:53:16,210 --> 02:53:18,610
Eaten to the family next door.
Oh,

3957
02:53:18,611 --> 02:53:20,350
this guy seems like perfect neighbor.

3958
02:53:20,410 --> 02:53:22,000
He mowed their lawn,
repair their car,

3959
02:53:22,001 --> 02:53:25,630
even invited them round for dinner.
Other residents in the small german town

3960
02:53:25,631 --> 02:53:29,140
of rottenberg also believed there was
nothing odd about the 42 year old

3961
02:53:29,141 --> 02:53:33,790
computer expert who's light burned late
into the night inside his creaking

3962
02:53:33,791 --> 02:53:35,410
mansion yesterday,
however,

3963
02:53:36,580 --> 02:53:40,990
news appeared in court,
charged with killing and then frying and

3964
02:53:40,991 --> 02:53:43,450
eating another man.
Wow.

3965
02:53:45,010 --> 02:53:45,843
Shit,
right?

3966
02:53:45,850 --> 02:53:49,240
Yeah.
He met the 43 year old berlin engineer

3967
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:54,540
burn brandiS after advertising on the
internet and had chopped him up and

3968
02:53:54,851 --> 02:53:56,050
eaten him.
It was.

3969
02:53:56,051 --> 02:53:59,100
He said something he had wanted to do
for a long time.

3970
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:00,820
came in.
I always wanted.

3971
02:54:01,270 --> 02:54:04,360
I always had the fantasy and in the end
I fulfilled it.

3972
02:54:04,390 --> 02:54:07,210
Muse said to the court,
and his first day was trial for murder

3973
02:54:07,570 --> 02:54:09,460
and the nearby city of castle.
Yesterday,

3974
02:54:09,461 --> 02:54:13,210
german prosecutors described how muse
had fantasized about killing and

3975
02:54:13,211 --> 02:54:16,000
devouring someone,
including his classmates.

3976
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:19,870
from the age of eight.
The desire grew stronger after the death

3977
02:54:19,871 --> 02:54:24,610
of his mother in 1999.
Prosecutor marcus kohler said in march

3978
02:54:24,611 --> 02:54:29,611
of 2001 muse advertise on the internet
for a young well built man who wanted to

3979
02:54:29,681 --> 02:54:31,210
be eaten.
Oh,

3980
02:54:31,360 --> 02:54:35,620
he advertised.
So he asked if anybody wants to be eaten

3981
02:54:35,710 --> 02:54:37,300
on this goes down.
Yeah.

3982
02:54:37,301 --> 02:54:39,910
So it Was the opposite.
And the evening of march nine,

3983
02:54:39,940 --> 02:54:43,120
two men went to the bedroom in muse,
rambling,

3984
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:47,750
timbered farmhouse,
mr brandis swallowed 20 sleeping tablets

3985
02:54:47,751 --> 02:54:50,750
and half a bottle of shops before muse
cutoff.

3986
02:54:51,070 --> 02:54:56,070
Brandon says penis with his agreement
and fried it for both of them to eat a

3987
02:54:56,570 --> 02:55:00,550
dick.
Well fried dick brandis by this stage,

3988
02:55:00,670 --> 02:55:04,880
bleeding heavily.
Then took a bath while muse read a star

3989
02:55:04,881 --> 02:55:06,740
trek novel.
Gangster.

3990
02:55:06,890 --> 02:55:11,270
The guy cut his dick off and he,
he went and read a book while the guy

3991
02:55:11,271 --> 02:55:14,020
bled out in a tub star,
track it to the bath,

3992
02:55:14,040 --> 02:55:14,810
needs a starch.

3993
02:55:14,810 --> 02:55:17,060
How much blood is coming out of this
guy?

3994
02:55:17,061 --> 02:55:18,500
Like why?
How do you even?

3995
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:20,750
Okay.
And the early hours of the morning,

3996
02:55:20,751 --> 02:55:25,070
he finished off his victim by stabbing
him in the neck with a large kish kiss

3997
02:55:25,310 --> 02:55:26,143
kitchen,
knife,

3998
02:55:26,150 --> 02:55:31,150
kissing him first was some weird shit.
The cannibal then chop mr.

3999
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:35,750
Brennan says into pieces and put several
bits of him in his freezer next to a

4000
02:55:35,751 --> 02:55:39,410
takeaway pizza and buried the skull and
his garden.

4001
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:43,700
Over the next few weeks,
he defrosted and cooked parts of mr

4002
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:48,350
brenda's in olive oil and garlic.
eventually consuming 20 kilograms of

4003
02:55:48,351 --> 02:55:53,351
human flesh before police finally turned
up at his door with my every bite.

4004
02:55:53,841 --> 02:55:58,310
My memory of him grew stronger,
crazy behind bars.

4005
02:55:58,311 --> 02:56:01,220
Muse told detectives that he first
consumed his victim with the bottom of

4006
02:56:01,221 --> 02:56:05,630
south african red wine,
had got out his best cutlery and

4007
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:09,170
decorated his dinner table with candles.
He toasts.

4008
02:56:09,230 --> 02:56:10,670
He tasted of pork.

4009
02:56:10,730 --> 02:56:15,730
He said he added low jesus christ.
It's not illegal.

4010
02:56:16,460 --> 02:56:19,160
Yeah.
The unprecedented case had proven

4011
02:56:19,161 --> 02:56:22,400
problematic for german lawyers who
discovered the cannibalism is not

4012
02:56:22,430 --> 02:56:24,230
illegal in Germany,
but it's murder.

4013
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:26,150
Okay,
so Instead they've charged me with

4014
02:56:26,151 --> 02:56:30,110
murder for the purposes of sexual
pleasure and with disturbing the peace

4015
02:56:30,111 --> 02:56:31,370
of the dead.
Oh shit.

4016
02:56:31,371 --> 02:56:34,760
There's video.
This was crucial to the case is a

4017
02:56:34,761 --> 02:56:39,761
gruesome videotape made of the entire
evening during which brand is apparently

4018
02:56:40,761 --> 02:56:42,830
makes clear his consent.
Whoa.

4019
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:46,370
I'm trying to see that deep front dick.
Go down and we'll see what that's like.

4020
02:56:46,730 --> 02:56:49,130
Oh my god.
Before setting off on is one way journey

4021
02:56:49,131 --> 02:56:51,640
to rottenberg.
Brandis was outwardly at least a

4022
02:56:51,641 --> 02:56:55,280
successful financially secure
professional with a live in girlfriend

4023
02:56:55,281 --> 02:56:58,880
jesus christ,
living girlfriend after killing after

4024
02:56:58,881 --> 02:57:01,490
killing brendan,
the german cannibal met five other men

4025
02:57:01,710 --> 02:57:03,770
who have responded to with internet
advert,

4026
02:57:03,830 --> 02:57:05,300
including one from london.

4027
02:57:05,530 --> 02:57:06,740
The best part did not,
however,

4028
02:57:06,741 --> 02:57:08,990
kill theM because his girlfriend broke
up with him.

4029
02:57:09,190 --> 02:57:11,970
It was revealed that he liked men.
Jesus.

4030
02:57:12,030 --> 02:57:13,280
Well,
he likes to eat them.

4031
02:57:13,360 --> 02:57:14,193
I eat dick's.
Go.

4032
02:57:14,380 --> 02:57:16,010
yeah.
Is that a problem for you?

4033
02:57:16,310 --> 02:57:18,200
Listen to this.
In july of 2001,

4034
02:57:18,201 --> 02:57:21,410
a students stumbled over muse chat room
and alerted the german authorIties who

4035
02:57:21,411 --> 02:57:25,580
arrested him last december,
so he was out running around for awhile.

4036
02:57:25,970 --> 02:57:28,700
How long was the time between december
and when he killed the dude?

4037
02:57:30,530 --> 02:57:32,690
I don't know.
There are a lot of people like this guys

4038
02:57:32,691 --> 02:57:33,920
messed up.
He,

4039
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:36,320
he ate 20 kilograms.
The guy's body.

4040
02:57:36,530 --> 02:57:41,150
Twenty kilograms is 44 pounds.
That's 44 meals.

4041
02:57:41,690 --> 02:57:44,030
A lot of it went to waste.
I don't know.

4042
02:57:44,110 --> 02:57:48,170
That has a 200 pound man know he needed
all.

4043
02:57:48,260 --> 02:57:50,810
He still had some of it.
They caught him before he could finish.

4044
02:57:50,840 --> 02:57:51,760
What does this say?
The trip?

4045
02:57:51,770 --> 02:57:54,530
Pretrial interview.
The cannibal said that after eating

4046
02:57:54,531 --> 02:57:58,370
brandis he felt much better and more
stable.

4047
02:57:58,940 --> 02:58:02,220
This bitch said he finished.
That is about having blog blonde,

4048
02:58:02,220 --> 02:58:04,860
young brother who could keep forever.
Pike consuming him.

4049
02:58:05,130 --> 02:58:07,500
Hey man.
You batshit crazy.

4050
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:11,190
Whoa.
Although they say that serial killers

4051
02:58:11,550 --> 02:58:14,910
like they get the final step is when
they start eating and drinking the blood

4052
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:18,480
of the victims because it's their way of
consuming and having complete and total

4053
02:58:18,481 --> 02:58:20,940
power over and he only gets five years
in jail though.

4054
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:23,100
Wow.
That's how that fucks back on the

4055
02:58:23,101 --> 02:58:25,350
streets and five.
He's already back in the street then

4056
02:58:25,351 --> 02:58:27,060
because I feel like the story was five
years ago.

4057
02:58:27,061 --> 02:58:29,370
Scroll,
scroll up longer than mIne.

4058
02:58:29,420 --> 02:58:32,190
I got up and made a movie about this
2013.

4059
02:58:32,191 --> 02:58:33,090
So it was three.
Oh,

4060
02:58:33,091 --> 02:58:34,200
three,
2003.

4061
02:58:35,130 --> 02:58:36,420
He's out.
he's out eating.

4062
02:58:36,421 --> 02:58:37,950
Yeah.
Google this motherfucker.

4063
02:58:37,951 --> 02:58:39,990
Arman.
Google that guy and put the word

4064
02:58:39,991 --> 02:58:42,460
released.
Look at him.

4065
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:45,420
He looks like it got cut your dick.
Oh my god.

4066
02:58:45,421 --> 02:58:48,450
He's a terrifying dude.
He dIdn't win the lottery.

4067
02:58:48,450 --> 02:58:49,920
When came to looks.
Hey,

4068
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:53,520
we look at his fucking face in the
interview with a campaign is an

4069
02:58:53,521 --> 02:58:57,400
interview with him,
set of chompers on them to do.

4070
02:58:57,480 --> 02:58:59,350
Did they make a movie about this?
Um,

4071
02:58:59,580 --> 02:59:02,190
I don't think they did.
I got to see it.

4072
02:59:02,310 --> 02:59:04,290
Video original.
No way.

4073
02:59:05,190 --> 02:59:08,280
What is that movie?
I think that's the movie.

4074
02:59:08,281 --> 02:59:10,080
Grim up.
Ready for the original.

4075
02:59:10,260 --> 02:59:12,240
Oh my god.
My mind.

4076
02:59:12,310 --> 02:59:14,940
Is there a real video?
Oh,

4077
02:59:15,010 --> 02:59:16,500
that's,
those are clay puppets.

4078
02:59:17,130 --> 02:59:19,350
That shit look real though for a second.
Oh my god.

4079
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:24,180
They should like with his dick.
Cut off with the shoulder.

4080
02:59:24,181 --> 02:59:25,440
So that's the real one,
man.

4081
02:59:25,470 --> 02:59:27,060
That's him splitting the guy down the
middle.

4082
02:59:27,760 --> 02:59:29,720
What would that?
Yeah.

4083
02:59:29,730 --> 02:59:31,080
Don't show people,
but that's him.

4084
02:59:31,110 --> 02:59:33,770
That's him splitting the guy down.
Yeah.

4085
02:59:33,950 --> 02:59:35,010
Okay.
That,

4086
02:59:35,030 --> 02:59:39,000
that was the real pictures.
That guy hang hung by his ankles and

4087
02:59:39,001 --> 02:59:39,630
split theM down.

4088
02:59:39,630 --> 02:59:43,740
The middle lake bled them out into
buckets and shit.

4089
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:47,820
Boy,
they say that the was the guy who

4090
02:59:47,880 --> 02:59:50,280
probably got stabbed.
He said he stabbed him in the neck.

4091
02:59:50,281 --> 02:59:52,740
It's prObably killed him.
He probAbly hung them upside down and

4092
02:59:52,741 --> 02:59:55,030
killed a man.
God is hitman.

4093
02:59:55,070 --> 02:59:55,950
Uh,
Richard,

4094
02:59:56,230 --> 02:59:57,240
uh,
ted,

4095
02:59:57,241 --> 02:59:58,380
ted,
what was the guy's name?

4096
02:59:58,381 --> 02:59:59,630
Who was the iceman?
Kalinski,

4097
02:59:59,740 --> 03:00:00,191
yeah,
he,

4098
03:00:00,191 --> 03:00:02,820
he said that they would do is they would
hang the body,

4099
03:00:02,821 --> 03:00:04,890
bleed it,
and then chop it up,

4100
03:00:05,010 --> 03:00:10,010
take it out to a boat and just either
drop it off the boat or they would bring

4101
03:00:10,891 --> 03:00:15,891
it to one of those car mashing places
and put the body under a car.

4102
03:00:16,010 --> 03:00:18,700
15 other cars and you'd just be,
you know.

4103
03:00:19,490 --> 03:00:22,620
Yeah.
I read this book called murder machine.

4104
03:00:22,710 --> 03:00:26,340
Joey diaz gave it to me back in the day.
It was all about this guy who was a mob,

4105
03:00:26,370 --> 03:00:27,960
roy de mayo,
I think his name was.

4106
03:00:28,260 --> 03:00:33,260
He was a mob assassin who just became a
fucking complete on full on psychopath,

4107
03:00:33,661 --> 03:00:38,280
serial killer who killed god,
knows how many people just kill people

4108
03:00:38,281 --> 03:00:40,650
left and right for whatever fucking
reason you want it to.

4109
03:00:40,680 --> 03:00:44,040
And this,
this pLace that they lived his bar area

4110
03:00:44,041 --> 03:00:46,470
where they had like an apartment
upstairs and he used to kill people in

4111
03:00:46,471 --> 03:00:48,750
this apartment.
These fucking killed like 100 people

4112
03:00:48,751 --> 03:00:49,820
there.
There's,

4113
03:00:50,010 --> 03:00:52,440
he just got addicted to killing.
And this is a book about.

4114
03:00:52,441 --> 03:00:54,450
He is in his words,
well,

4115
03:00:54,451 --> 03:00:56,940
it's his story.
The investigators,

4116
03:00:56,941 --> 03:00:58,110
they caught him.
They caught him,

4117
03:00:58,470 --> 03:00:59,950
but it's a disturbing book,
man.

4118
03:00:59,951 --> 03:01:00,070
It's

4119
03:01:00,070 --> 03:01:01,390
one of those books where you go,
well,

4120
03:01:01,420 --> 03:01:03,550
you just have to realize those people
are out there.

4121
03:01:03,551 --> 03:01:04,690
They're out there.
They're out there.

4122
03:01:04,990 --> 03:01:06,780
Stuff makes me sick.
That's it should.

4123
03:01:06,790 --> 03:01:09,850
That's why we need tim kennedy.
Exactly.

4124
03:01:10,100 --> 03:01:11,410
Yeah.
Here it is.

4125
03:01:11,411 --> 03:01:14,160
An interview with a cannibal.
Documentaries sheds new light on one of

4126
03:01:14,170 --> 03:01:18,390
germany's most infamous murders and this
is from 2016.

4127
03:01:18,620 --> 03:01:20,080
IT's on youtube.
I was just looking at it,

4128
03:01:20,081 --> 03:01:23,020
so he's free.
The documentary for eight years.

4129
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:25,480
It's what I found out.
He said it became a vegetarian while I

4130
03:01:25,481 --> 03:01:28,320
was in jail as well.
Kenny takes until

4131
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:33,010
he's going to come out and he's going to
start eating people again,

4132
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:34,900
you even 40 pounds of may and then I'm
like,

4133
03:01:34,901 --> 03:01:35,411
nah,
man,

4134
03:01:35,411 --> 03:01:37,840
I'm not into meat anymore.
How much do you think they'd have the

4135
03:01:37,841 --> 03:01:40,620
footage of the act itself,
which was shown in a closed room to the

4136
03:01:40,630 --> 03:01:45,630
trial is described in the documentary as
too disturbing to show and so shocking

4137
03:01:45,791 --> 03:01:49,150
that only 19 minutes of the four hour
video was shown.

4138
03:01:52,140 --> 03:01:56,950
His behavior as a child was described as
like most other children his age.

4139
03:01:57,250 --> 03:02:00,970
He loved animals and found country life
idealic.

4140
03:02:01,880 --> 03:02:06,690
Well,
some people are just crazy.

4141
03:02:06,691 --> 03:02:07,524
The other guy.
Yeah,

4142
03:02:07,810 --> 03:02:08,920
yeah,
yeah.

4143
03:02:08,921 --> 03:02:09,670
That's the guy.
Hey,

4144
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:12,340
he looks stable.
That guy wanted to be butchered because

4145
03:02:12,341 --> 03:02:14,140
hIs.
Because his girlfriend caught them with

4146
03:02:14,141 --> 03:02:15,100
men.
Is that what it was?

4147
03:02:16,030 --> 03:02:18,430
It tasted the flesh taste like pork,
but stronger.

4148
03:02:18,820 --> 03:02:22,990
Jesus christ.
It's just amazing that he's free now.

4149
03:02:23,350 --> 03:02:25,510
I'm.
I almost wish I could speak german so I

4150
03:02:25,511 --> 03:02:28,300
could understand what he's saying to
bring his dumb ass in here with a

4151
03:02:28,310 --> 03:02:31,030
translator.
You don't want to hear it.

4152
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:32,081
Well,
I don't know,

4153
03:02:32,081 --> 03:02:33,250
man.
I'm not going to kill you guys.

4154
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:34,840
It's almost like a no.
Bring him in.

4155
03:02:34,841 --> 03:02:36,580
No,
that's never happened in with a

4156
03:02:36,581 --> 03:02:39,910
translator like ufc interview in german.
That guy knowing where I am,

4157
03:02:40,480 --> 03:02:45,480
we just notice what your studios that
maybe we bring them here to kill him.

4158
03:02:46,040 --> 03:02:48,170
You start caring.
I want to start carrying two guns.

4159
03:02:49,560 --> 03:02:52,790
Gun isn't an acuity gun,
But he's not going to kill you.

4160
03:02:52,791 --> 03:02:54,150
Everyone here.
Can you let?

4161
03:02:54,250 --> 03:02:55,780
Yeah.
If you let him kill you,

4162
03:02:55,781 --> 03:02:58,030
he'll eat you.
If you give them any sort of light like,

4163
03:02:58,031 --> 03:02:58,541
yeah,
you know,

4164
03:02:58,541 --> 03:03:03,070
I'm kind of depressed.
He's killing needs help with wine.

4165
03:03:03,610 --> 03:03:07,420
But there are people in vans right now
trolling around looking for someone to

4166
03:03:07,421 --> 03:03:09,010
eat.
I don't think so.

4167
03:03:09,300 --> 03:03:11,500
Definitely.
I mean it was too.

4168
03:03:11,740 --> 03:03:14,680
It goes back to what we're talking about
when we're talking about bathrooms and

4169
03:03:14,681 --> 03:03:18,880
transgender people and the the amount of
creeps that are actually not

4170
03:03:18,881 --> 03:03:20,740
transgender,
just sexual predators

4171
03:03:22,470 --> 03:03:25,060
to come up with a way to get someone in
the vein right now.

4172
03:03:25,061 --> 03:03:27,940
There's a small amount of People right
now in this country,

4173
03:03:28,210 --> 03:03:31,810
just this country that are fighting off
the urge to commit rape and murder

4174
03:03:32,750 --> 03:03:33,583
monsters.
Right?

4175
03:03:33,590 --> 03:03:35,720
Tell me a white van,
a group of dudes is driving around la

4176
03:03:35,810 --> 03:03:40,780
toronto people probably not,
but likely somewhat.

4177
03:03:40,781 --> 03:03:42,910
Look,
all they have to do is one crime or

4178
03:03:42,911 --> 03:03:45,730
someone drinks someone's blood and kill
someone by biting him in the neck and

4179
03:03:45,731 --> 03:03:47,890
then it becomes a copycat.
People are weird.

4180
03:03:48,220 --> 03:03:51,250
I met a girl who she was.
We were talking and said,

4181
03:03:51,251 --> 03:03:51,551
well,
I've,

4182
03:03:51,551 --> 03:03:54,510
I've,
I've had trouble getting on my phone too

4183
03:03:54,511 --> 03:03:56,510
much.
We're ruining brendan.

4184
03:03:58,460 --> 03:04:03,020
I met a girl who said she couldn't get.
She had said she'd had a tough time last

4185
03:04:03,021 --> 03:04:04,940
two years and I was trying to ask her.
Finally,

4186
03:04:04,941 --> 03:04:05,451
she said,
well,

4187
03:04:05,451 --> 03:04:06,680
my,
my cousin was killed.

4188
03:04:06,681 --> 03:04:07,910
my first cousin was killed,
and I said,

4189
03:04:07,930 --> 03:04:10,700
oh.
She said this guy was killing men.

4190
03:04:10,730 --> 03:04:14,710
He wAs spiking their drInks.
He would take them outside,

4191
03:04:14,750 --> 03:04:18,560
have sex with them and then kill them
and that there are people that just do

4192
03:04:18,561 --> 03:04:21,620
weird shit that just kind of predators.
They set their whole life up

4193
03:04:23,270 --> 03:04:25,990
and told me there's people in pants.
Look around deep people.

4194
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:29,900
There's people that are with puppies as,
as long as an is cadbury eggs and

4195
03:04:29,901 --> 03:04:31,820
twizzlers.
That's how you get him in the fucking

4196
03:04:31,821 --> 03:04:32,571
van.
Especially.

4197
03:04:32,571 --> 03:04:34,340
We just put some twizzlers and were
done.

4198
03:04:34,341 --> 03:04:35,570
What happened?
I am,

4199
03:04:35,571 --> 03:04:38,500
but if you put in my face like the
cadbury egg,

4200
03:04:38,510 --> 03:04:39,730
like yoda,
ugly this week.

4201
03:04:39,730 --> 03:04:40,810
Oh shit.
What's this?

4202
03:04:41,290 --> 03:04:43,070
When do a goddamn thing to me?
Listen,

4203
03:04:43,071 --> 03:04:44,450
if you really weak this,
um,

4204
03:04:44,750 --> 03:04:47,060
chili mangoes faze me.
I haven't cheated.

4205
03:04:47,061 --> 03:04:49,730
Yeah.
Doug and I said something else in that

4206
03:04:49,731 --> 03:04:52,030
bag.
If I walked in and you had fresh cadbury

4207
03:04:52,031 --> 03:04:53,960
eggs,
peel from the wrapper without those

4208
03:04:53,961 --> 03:04:55,430
chili mangoes.
We actually just opened one of those

4209
03:04:55,431 --> 03:04:56,500
bags.
let you smell it.

4210
03:04:57,440 --> 03:04:58,770
I'll get excited.
Well,

4211
03:04:59,330 --> 03:05:02,000
if you had the five or you can only five
foods,

4212
03:05:02,001 --> 03:05:03,950
what would they be?
Temporary eggs and my five foods

4213
03:05:03,951 --> 03:05:05,440
forever.
well I would,

4214
03:05:05,480 --> 03:05:07,190
if I,
if I was restricted to that,

4215
03:05:07,191 --> 03:05:09,200
I would do it only based on nutrition.
So elk,

4216
03:05:09,230 --> 03:05:10,150
elk meat?
Yeah.

4217
03:05:10,160 --> 03:05:12,320
I would eat something like that.
Wild game,

4218
03:05:12,321 --> 03:05:13,520
meat,
avocados,

4219
03:05:13,610 --> 03:05:17,300
healthy vegetables like kale.
It would be all boring shit because it

4220
03:05:17,390 --> 03:05:18,410
will help me.
It's not boring,

4221
03:05:18,411 --> 03:05:21,320
but if I,
you know that I would have to like leave

4222
03:05:21,321 --> 03:05:21,920
it at that.

4223
03:05:21,920 --> 03:05:25,280
But I think if you only ate five things,
you'd probably going to get sick unless

4224
03:05:25,281 --> 03:05:28,580
you're supplementing yourself.
You've goT to make sure you're getting a

4225
03:05:28,581 --> 03:05:31,400
proper amount of vitamin c.
You'd be fucking chance.

4226
03:05:31,430 --> 03:05:33,450
I'd imagined yams,
kale,

4227
03:05:33,470 --> 03:05:34,910
avocado,
elk.

4228
03:05:35,090 --> 03:05:36,230
You get a lot of stuff there.
Right?

4229
03:05:36,410 --> 03:05:38,900
I think people benefit more than other
animals too,

4230
03:05:38,930 --> 03:05:42,050
on a variety of different foods.
On varying your diet.

4231
03:05:42,360 --> 03:05:44,120
Yeah.
More like animals have a problem with

4232
03:05:44,121 --> 03:05:44,990
that.
Like dogs,

4233
03:05:44,991 --> 03:05:48,200
like you can't switch up dog food if you
give a dog one kind of food,

4234
03:05:48,210 --> 03:05:51,680
then you give him something else.
Just get explosive babies the same way

4235
03:05:51,681 --> 03:05:53,280
though.
Like if you changed the formula baby

4236
03:05:54,230 --> 03:05:56,810
shit everywhere.
Can you get too much iron from eating

4237
03:05:56,811 --> 03:05:59,540
meat every day?
Shows much iron.

4238
03:05:59,541 --> 03:06:00,950
Yeah.
That's interesting.

4239
03:06:00,951 --> 03:06:02,930
I've never heard that.
I had high iron,

4240
03:06:03,310 --> 03:06:05,830
high iron count one time when I went and
got my blood done.

4241
03:06:05,880 --> 03:06:07,430
How much media you.
But he said,

4242
03:06:07,460 --> 03:06:09,230
he said,
but he said,

4243
03:06:09,231 --> 03:06:10,490
you know,
it's fucking crazy.

4244
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,880
I was cooking from a cast iron.
Oh yeah,

4245
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:16,640
yeah.
And the cast iron iron in your food

4246
03:06:17,230 --> 03:06:18,063
tray.
Siren because.

4247
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:19,850
Hi ferris.
I levels.

4248
03:06:19,870 --> 03:06:20,900
Yeah,
I cook a lot.

4249
03:06:20,901 --> 03:06:23,210
And iron pants.
That's the best thing for you.

4250
03:06:23,211 --> 03:06:24,640
It's a good way to get iron.
Yeah.

4251
03:06:24,980 --> 03:06:28,230
Probably a good way for people to get
iron to that are vegetarians like if you

4252
03:06:28,540 --> 03:06:32,180
feel like that's exactly what they tell
vegetarians to cook in a cast iron

4253
03:06:32,210 --> 03:06:32,901
skillet.
Yeah.

4254
03:06:32,901 --> 03:06:35,360
That's a good way to do it because you
get low iron if you're a vegetarian,

4255
03:06:35,750 --> 03:06:38,210
you also get a lot of creatine if you're
eating a lot of red meat,

4256
03:06:38,570 --> 03:06:41,330
like you don't need a dose on created.
I used to take so much creatine,

4257
03:06:41,450 --> 03:06:43,790
but because it's not a little lot of red
meat,

4258
03:06:43,791 --> 03:06:45,050
stuff like that.
Don't take any credit.

4259
03:06:45,070 --> 03:06:46,970
So you're doinG your keto genic right?
Yeah.

4260
03:06:46,971 --> 03:06:49,610
I think creatine is like legit
supplement.

4261
03:06:49,700 --> 03:06:53,090
It's one of the few legit supplements
that actually does really increase your

4262
03:06:53,091 --> 03:06:54,460
strength.
I've been taken in.

4263
03:06:54,470 --> 03:06:55,650
Recovery does.

4264
03:06:55,980 --> 03:06:57,450
It's legit.
You know,

4265
03:06:57,451 --> 03:07:01,320
a lot of these things that like the tool
goes back to the yoel yoel romero thing

4266
03:07:01,350 --> 03:07:05,310
and even adjust jeff novitsky thing.
A lot of the Stuff that we see in these

4267
03:07:05,311 --> 03:07:10,311
stores like gnc and health stores that
have these muscle building things,

4268
03:07:10,830 --> 03:07:13,290
a lot of those things are really
steroids really now.

4269
03:07:13,350 --> 03:07:14,183
Yeah.
Yeah.

4270
03:07:14,750 --> 03:07:16,880
Form like,
wow,

4271
03:07:17,290 --> 03:07:21,150
you guys keep pissing hot from the usada
has a website that we,

4272
03:07:21,210 --> 03:07:24,300
when novitsky was here,
he sent us to the website and you go

4273
03:07:24,301 --> 03:07:28,050
like a through z,
you find whatever the supplement is and

4274
03:07:28,051 --> 03:07:31,060
you list to see if whether or not people
have been popped for it,

4275
03:07:31,360 --> 03:07:34,320
like they test and and they pull these
things off the market and they just come

4276
03:07:34,321 --> 03:07:35,850
back with some new name.
They switch.

4277
03:07:37,130 --> 03:07:39,480
Remember mark maguire,
the stuff he was using,

4278
03:07:39,481 --> 03:07:41,130
you could buy at jet style.

4279
03:07:42,340 --> 03:07:44,320
I took that shit that you get by.
Okay.

4280
03:07:45,310 --> 03:07:47,700
Yeah.
Well sort of as a steroid precursor

4281
03:07:47,701 --> 03:07:49,920
hormone precursor,
but here's the deal.

4282
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:55,700
He wasn't thinking that he's holding his
fucking whatever.

4283
03:07:55,831 --> 03:07:59,190
Even think he was taking that for the
fuck of it.

4284
03:07:59,220 --> 03:08:03,330
Just to see how he fell maybe,
but he was injecting straight to this,

4285
03:08:04,590 --> 03:08:08,060
that anderson and worked a little but he
was.

4286
03:08:08,510 --> 03:08:11,990
He was on the is that you see how like
I,

4287
03:08:12,030 --> 03:08:13,910
it's been a,
it's been a less than me where I looked

4288
03:08:13,911 --> 03:08:16,660
back and I,
I realized when you play sports in the

4289
03:08:16,730 --> 03:08:20,580
weights,
nobody's 240 pounds in just that jack.

4290
03:08:20,610 --> 03:08:24,360
I mean some people have a lot of
professionals you don't do.

4291
03:08:24,390 --> 03:08:26,490
You don't go from being.
That's true,

4292
03:08:26,520 --> 03:08:31,190
but you don't want me one 85 when you're
25 and then the big dramatic difference,

4293
03:08:31,220 --> 03:08:32,840
especially if they're like a veteran.
Yeah,

4294
03:08:32,841 --> 03:08:34,590
something's up,
but there's a lot of freaks.

4295
03:08:34,590 --> 03:08:39,030
You can achieve some incredible results
with discipline and the right protocol

4296
03:08:39,031 --> 03:08:42,090
with hypertrophy.
You could eat a lot of food all day

4297
03:08:42,091 --> 03:08:44,370
long,
lift crazy weights and when you're

4298
03:08:44,371 --> 03:08:46,800
young,
if your body holds up to the workload,

4299
03:08:46,950 --> 03:08:49,200
you can put on some massive weight when
you're young,

4300
03:08:49,201 --> 03:08:51,120
when your hormones are strong,
if you do it the right way,

4301
03:08:51,121 --> 03:08:54,060
like say if you had like a strength
lifting coach and you said,

4302
03:08:54,061 --> 03:08:56,520
hey,
I want to gain 20 pounds of muscle.

4303
03:08:56,521 --> 03:08:58,010
If you had to do it right now,
they would go,

4304
03:08:58,020 --> 03:08:59,250
oh,
we got to fuck with your hormones.

4305
03:08:59,670 --> 03:09:03,070
Like you're too old at this point that,
but if you want,

4306
03:09:03,780 --> 03:09:08,780
but if you were 20 and you did the same
thing to your body type,

4307
03:09:09,450 --> 03:09:11,060
I don't really think I could do,
you know,

4308
03:09:11,200 --> 03:09:13,830
it's hard for me to put on any muscle
maybe.

4309
03:09:13,890 --> 03:09:17,100
But You're not a guy who's ever tried
and you don't really know if your

4310
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:18,953
program.

4311
03:09:19,020 --> 03:09:19,711
YeaH.
Yeah.

4312
03:09:19,711 --> 03:09:21,450
You're not frail,
you know,

4313
03:09:21,451 --> 03:09:24,870
I mean your skin.
You're not running weightlifting guy

4314
03:09:24,871 --> 03:09:25,400
though,
right?

4315
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:27,420
Like you don't live.
I do lyft but not like that.

4316
03:09:27,450 --> 03:09:31,980
How often do you left?
Probably twice a week and twice a week

4317
03:09:31,981 --> 03:09:33,360
is fine.
When you lift,

4318
03:09:33,361 --> 03:09:37,110
you lift heavy weights.
I try to like where am I failure at six.

4319
03:09:37,530 --> 03:09:40,710
Eight.
Put your guys doing more of a cardio

4320
03:09:40,711 --> 03:09:41,700
like circuit,
right?

4321
03:09:42,100 --> 03:09:44,850
A dead lifts,
squats,

4322
03:09:44,851 --> 03:09:47,280
bench.
Well I'll do like lately,

4323
03:09:47,281 --> 03:09:50,550
like I'll go from deadlift to pull ups,
you know,

4324
03:09:50,750 --> 03:09:54,340
where and the deadlift is what by the
eighth I'm hurting,

4325
03:09:54,370 --> 03:09:56,710
you know.
But again I'll do that once a week,

4326
03:09:56,830 --> 03:10:00,430
you know?
And then I'll do a maybe some bench with

4327
03:10:00,431 --> 03:10:03,810
like 60 pound dumbbells and then I'll do
mine.

4328
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:05,400
Yeah.
Almost a 49.

4329
03:10:05,860 --> 03:10:06,693
Well,
you know,

4330
03:10:06,730 --> 03:10:10,870
one of the things about [inaudible] is
interview with tim ferriss.

4331
03:10:10,871 --> 03:10:14,560
He was talking about his dad getting
involved in power lifting when he was in

4332
03:10:14,561 --> 03:10:19,210
his sixties is he taught his dad power
lifting was dad was in his sixties and

4333
03:10:19,211 --> 03:10:22,690
like six,
seven years later he put on x amount of

4334
03:10:22,691 --> 03:10:25,980
pounds of muscle and he said he looks
like a 40 year old man now from like if

4335
03:10:25,990 --> 03:10:27,520
you see his back and he did.

4336
03:10:28,330 --> 03:10:31,240
I think if you did leave my skeptical
hippo.

4337
03:10:33,340 --> 03:10:34,580
Hippo.
I didn't know about skeptical,

4338
03:10:34,930 --> 03:10:36,250
skeptical hippo.
Jamie,

4339
03:10:36,251 --> 03:10:37,170
bring that up.
Bring that.

4340
03:10:39,030 --> 03:10:40,600
Bring that up.
By the way,

4341
03:10:41,860 --> 03:10:43,750
when you.
Powerlifting is good.

4342
03:10:44,020 --> 03:10:45,910
If you do it right.
I think it's probably good for your

4343
03:10:45,911 --> 03:10:48,760
hormones and good for your body.
Like I feel good when I lift heavy,

4344
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,780
like I have more energy that releases
testosterone.

4345
03:10:51,810 --> 03:10:52,770
Next sheet.
Yeah.

4346
03:10:52,780 --> 03:10:53,561
That's good for you.
Well,

4347
03:10:53,561 --> 03:10:57,610
with pavel things
when you told me that six year old put

4348
03:10:57,611 --> 03:10:59,530
on lps,
that's my face,

4349
03:10:59,531 --> 03:11:01,670
right?
That's fucking hilarious.

4350
03:11:01,890 --> 03:11:05,800
I've never seen from the more skeptical
he was talking about with ferris was

4351
03:11:05,801 --> 03:11:08,500
talking about or pavel was talking about
rather was his protocol,

4352
03:11:08,650 --> 03:11:12,820
which is that never more than five
repetitions and never go to failure.

4353
03:11:13,200 --> 03:11:13,470
Like,
oh,

4354
03:11:13,470 --> 03:11:14,051
really?
Yeah,

4355
03:11:14,051 --> 03:11:18,340
his ideas that if you say if you lift
something and like the most reps you can

4356
03:11:18,341 --> 03:11:21,760
do is like seven,
cut it off at five and and put it down

4357
03:11:21,790 --> 03:11:25,390
and that strength is a skill and that
you want what he calls the greasing the

4358
03:11:25,391 --> 03:11:27,220
groove,
like doing something over and over

4359
03:11:27,221 --> 03:11:29,050
again,
giving yourself plenty of time in

4360
03:11:29,051 --> 03:11:30,550
between it so that you,
you're strong,

4361
03:11:30,551 --> 03:11:33,670
you're fully recovered and you'll get
stronger and you'll get stronger fast.

4362
03:11:33,670 --> 03:11:35,340
Who's thIs guy?
Pavel tatsumi.

4363
03:11:35,380 --> 03:11:39,700
He's the godfather of kettlebells.
A guy that came to America and started a

4364
03:11:39,730 --> 03:11:43,900
kettlebell programs like all kettlebell
instruction pretty much came out of that

4365
03:11:43,901 --> 03:11:45,370
guy because I've.
Yes,

4366
03:11:45,371 --> 03:11:46,240
he does.
Yeah,

4367
03:11:46,241 --> 03:11:51,241
he does live in santa monica.
I will take out the back of 75 year old

4368
03:11:51,311 --> 03:11:53,680
dead lifter 100 percent drug free.
That's his dad.

4369
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,450
Yeah.
Well,

4370
03:11:55,470 --> 03:11:56,111
uh,
I mean,

4371
03:11:56,111 --> 03:11:57,420
who knows?
Maybe his dad,

4372
03:11:57,430 --> 03:12:00,300
some fuckinG savage and freak.
Yeah,

4373
03:12:00,550 --> 03:12:01,061
for sure.
Again,

4374
03:12:01,061 --> 03:12:02,590
he ended up pissing this.
Yeah.

4375
03:12:03,250 --> 03:12:05,230
Hey,
a golden snitch.

4376
03:12:05,380 --> 03:12:06,460
Vlp again.
Get on it.

4377
03:12:06,790 --> 03:12:08,620
No,
I don't want to piss test.

4378
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:12,670
We're going to with a guy like that guy.
Like how long has that work at us and an

4379
03:12:12,671 --> 03:12:14,100
hour question.
Good question.

4380
03:12:14,110 --> 03:12:15,520
Doing all that rest.
Well,

4381
03:12:15,521 --> 03:12:18,650
what I do is what I've been doing over
the last few weeks since I listen to

4382
03:12:18,651 --> 03:12:19,860
this podcast is,
you know,

4383
03:12:20,020 --> 03:12:21,220
because I have stuff at home.

4384
03:12:21,460 --> 03:12:25,270
I have a little gym in my house,
so what I'll do is I just start working

4385
03:12:25,271 --> 03:12:26,650
out,
well not even in the garage,

4386
03:12:26,651 --> 03:12:29,800
inside the house.
I have a weight gym so I'll go and I'll

4387
03:12:29,801 --> 03:12:33,250
just lift weights during the day and
then I'll do it later at night.

4388
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:36,520
Like a lift weights,
like I'll go home now and I'll do a few

4389
03:12:36,521 --> 03:12:40,790
sets of chin ups and some kettle bell
swings and curls and stuff or a and

4390
03:12:40,810 --> 03:12:44,800
cleans and stuff like that.
Then later that night I'll do like clean

4391
03:12:44,801 --> 03:12:47,830
squat press.
I'll do some some different shit and

4392
03:12:47,831 --> 03:12:52,520
I'll do my psets throughout the daylight
that split it instead of smashing it in,

4393
03:12:52,820 --> 03:12:57,820
but my cardio I still do in one big set,
so what I do like to do for cardio is I

4394
03:12:58,071 --> 03:13:01,040
like to lift weights first and get
really fucking tired.

4395
03:13:01,340 --> 03:13:05,210
Then once I'm really tired,
I do like balls out cardio for a half

4396
03:13:05,210 --> 03:13:10,210
hour already exhausted and then I feel
it's more of a mental thing for me is my

4397
03:13:11,871 --> 03:13:13,070
cardio and that's great.

4398
03:13:13,730 --> 03:13:14,290
Great.
Great.

4399
03:13:14,290 --> 03:13:17,090
I've been doing get my cardio in with my
lifting,

4400
03:13:17,091 --> 03:13:21,770
so I'll do like heavy deadlifts and the
set is whatever set of 10 of heavy

4401
03:13:21,771 --> 03:13:23,600
deadlifts.
I go straight from there to the

4402
03:13:23,601 --> 03:13:25,970
treadmill and I'll sprint as fast I can
for a minute.

4403
03:13:26,300 --> 03:13:27,920
Unlike level 10,
11,

4404
03:13:27,921 --> 03:13:29,990
12,
just literally as fast as I can and I go

4405
03:13:29,991 --> 03:13:32,680
to pull ups.
We do that for five heavy debt.

4406
03:13:32,690 --> 03:13:34,880
That's awesome.
Three 15.

4407
03:13:34,910 --> 03:13:38,510
If I'm doing 10,
it's a lot because you do five rounds.

4408
03:13:39,250 --> 03:13:40,083
Yeah,
the

4409
03:13:41,420 --> 03:13:45,770
deadly heavy dead lifts for me,
cardio was me the fun for me.

4410
03:13:45,771 --> 03:13:48,140
I do the cross bar where I stand in the
middle of it,

4411
03:13:48,180 --> 03:13:49,990
you know,
and I do deadlift with that,

4412
03:13:50,140 --> 03:13:50,931
that,
that to me,

4413
03:13:50,931 --> 03:13:53,030
is that what I.
That's my always my go to,

4414
03:13:53,240 --> 03:13:58,100
they say specifically that bar,
like using that trap bar for deadlIfts

4415
03:13:58,130 --> 03:14:03,130
is one of the best ways to like excite
your entire system safest to one of the

4416
03:14:03,261 --> 03:14:06,170
safest,
but it's also like you're gripping it

4417
03:14:06,230 --> 03:14:07,010
the way you're gripping it.

4418
03:14:07,010 --> 03:14:09,890
Like there's something weird about that
over under grip that you do with a

4419
03:14:09,900 --> 03:14:12,830
standard dumbbell and then you bang it
off your shins and straighten your

4420
03:14:12,860 --> 03:14:15,230
backup.
But this motherfucker is like right in

4421
03:14:15,231 --> 03:14:17,540
the group so you could have really
excellent posture,

4422
03:14:17,570 --> 03:14:21,950
puts less of a load on your lower back
and you could really fucking stack up

4423
03:14:21,951 --> 03:14:24,030
with some heavy weight.
You can do some cool stuff with two

4424
03:14:24,040 --> 03:14:25,450
farmer's walk.
Oh yeah.

4425
03:14:26,540 --> 03:14:30,230
I was thumbing through a book called the
supple leopard kelly start.

4426
03:14:30,320 --> 03:14:31,190
Yeah.
Did you see?

4427
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:32,240
That?
Looks really cool.

4428
03:14:32,270 --> 03:14:36,530
You see what dalea did still?
He didn't know who kelly start was.

4429
03:14:36,531 --> 03:14:39,640
He didn't know kelly starr was a famous
strength conditioning guy.

4430
03:14:39,641 --> 03:14:41,740
I just saw a ridiculous photo of him.
He does look,

4431
03:14:41,790 --> 03:14:43,760
so he did this long.
You know,

4432
03:14:43,761 --> 03:14:45,530
dalea has a hilarious.
I saw that.

4433
03:14:45,531 --> 03:14:50,030
I see as these long,
huge run on sentences of how fucked up

4434
03:14:50,031 --> 03:14:50,864
these guys are.

4435
03:14:50,930 --> 03:14:54,990
And he did it with kelly start and is
one of the funniest things he's looking

4436
03:14:55,110 --> 03:14:55,551
at.
He said,

4437
03:14:55,551 --> 03:14:56,570
I mean,
this dude,

4438
03:14:56,571 --> 03:14:59,600
I can't stop laughing.
Does he know the camera can zoom out and

4439
03:14:59,601 --> 03:15:03,850
he can put his head regular and looks
like he's trying to peek into the lens.

4440
03:15:03,851 --> 03:15:08,851
Say you guys fucking or can I come in?
He just keeps going on and on and on and

4441
03:15:10,241 --> 03:15:14,090
on.
Most peaking this motherfucker ever even

4442
03:15:14,091 --> 03:15:15,980
tom is like,
he peaks more than me.

4443
03:15:16,660 --> 03:15:17,840
He says,
I'm dying.

4444
03:15:18,020 --> 03:15:21,050
This guy looks like he hurt his neck
five seconds ago.

4445
03:15:23,190 --> 03:15:24,400
It's really hard.
Long.

4446
03:15:24,630 --> 03:15:26,930
He keeps going and going.
I didn't want to read it all,

4447
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:30,050
but it's like you said,
this is the look that you give a guy

4448
03:15:30,230 --> 03:15:31,970
when you're fucking his wife after he
fucked.

4449
03:15:31,971 --> 03:15:36,971
Your wife
is so fun.

4450
03:15:37,820 --> 03:15:40,100
I retweeted it,
but please go to chris's account.

4451
03:15:40,170 --> 03:15:43,580
Good,
funny motherfucker.

4452
03:15:43,610 --> 03:15:44,450
Oh,
he's hIlarious.

4453
03:15:44,470 --> 03:15:46,490
She's another good dude too,
man.

4454
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:49,030
it's nice having him around the store is
fun.

4455
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:50,040
He's the best.
He's

4456
03:15:50,040 --> 03:15:53,300
one of my favorite people in the store
is on fire.

4457
03:15:55,110 --> 03:16:00,110
You know what else on fire fighter and
the kid this weekend live in boston.

4458
03:16:00,391 --> 03:16:02,220
Ladies and gentlemen.

4459
03:16:02,221 --> 03:16:06,750

4464
03:16:18,840 --> 03:16:20,450
How long have you guys there for?
One night.

4465
03:16:20,520 --> 03:16:22,860
You go to New York,
then we got to boston,

4466
03:16:22,861 --> 03:16:24,640
then we go to the truck and around
philly and I'm like,

4467
03:16:24,670 --> 03:16:27,270
I'm sure with shows there what you asked
me to come see me,

4468
03:16:27,300 --> 03:16:30,480
we should organize some gigs,
like at least in the same town together.

4469
03:16:30,520 --> 03:16:33,520
Have you done,
have you done the helium in st louis or

4470
03:16:33,521 --> 03:16:33,870
is that.

4471
03:16:33,870 --> 03:16:37,910
I've only done helium in portland,
which is fucking outstanding and

4472
03:16:38,450 --> 03:16:41,070
chilies,
which is my best client I'm doing.

4473
03:16:41,550 --> 03:16:44,160
I'm doing their club in st louis,
June 9th,

4474
03:16:44,161 --> 03:16:46,500
10th and 11th.
So get your tickets.

4475
03:16:47,970 --> 03:16:49,770
I liked that website.
Who did that website?

4476
03:16:49,771 --> 03:16:53,650
I brother.
Your brother's a website designer was a

4477
03:16:53,660 --> 03:16:57,150
beast.
he does all my brother makes websites.

4478
03:16:57,510 --> 03:16:58,770
Really.
Does he do it professionally?

4479
03:16:58,771 --> 03:17:01,410
Is you just do it for you?
How long did it take them to use

4480
03:17:01,440 --> 03:17:02,700
squarespace to.
Oh no.

4481
03:17:03,110 --> 03:17:04,530
yep.
This is squarespace.

4482
03:17:05,100 --> 03:17:06,950
Dude.
This is a beast.

4483
03:17:06,990 --> 03:17:09,510
This is really good.
A great job.

4484
03:17:09,511 --> 03:17:11,190
The photographs in the background are
awesome.

4485
03:17:11,220 --> 03:17:14,430
All our merchandise hat.
I did that from a photo shoot and

4486
03:17:14,431 --> 03:17:15,660
abraham lincoln.
Karate.

4487
03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:20,160
Goddamn right.
you ever had like a vampire slayer?

4488
03:17:20,930 --> 03:17:22,590
So are just.
We covered the ufc.

4489
03:17:22,950 --> 03:17:24,810
I knew this wasn't going to be a ufc
podcast.

4490
03:17:24,811 --> 03:17:26,330
We always somewhat.

4491
03:17:26,490 --> 03:17:28,140
Some kind of.
We talked about it.

4492
03:17:28,350 --> 03:17:29,760
Yeah.
I just still don't want.

4493
03:17:29,800 --> 03:17:33,390
Why I want to know what's the latest
deleah sent me a text.

4494
03:17:33,480 --> 03:17:36,420
Totally unrelated,
lIke didn't know that we were doing a

4495
03:17:36,421 --> 03:17:38,130
podcast.
Probably didn't know we were even

4496
03:17:38,131 --> 03:17:42,930
talking about him and he sent me a text
about kelly.

4497
03:17:42,931 --> 03:17:46,080
Start retweeting that thing,
thinking it's hilarious.

4498
03:17:46,380 --> 03:17:48,090
And he said,
guy seems cool.

4499
03:17:48,091 --> 03:17:53,091
I love that shit when people get jokes.
So delete just sent me this psychic

4500
03:17:53,371 --> 03:17:56,650
connection mattered.
But that's what's crazy is that like

4501
03:17:56,670 --> 03:18:01,470
that picture that I put up was days ago
and the fact that he said it literally

4502
03:18:01,471 --> 03:18:04,110
texted me while we were talking about
how weird.

4503
03:18:04,170 --> 03:18:05,003
That is.
Weird.

4504
03:18:05,640 --> 03:18:06,680
What are you going to do,
dude?

4505
03:18:06,960 --> 03:18:08,910
It's spooky.
Man

4506
03:18:10,420 --> 03:18:13,230
can trash.
The earth is flat.

4507
03:18:13,380 --> 03:18:15,000
He got owned.
I got owned by crystal.

4508
03:18:15,010 --> 03:18:16,410
Earth is flat,
but he's.

4509
03:18:16,460 --> 03:18:17,310
Kelly's a good guy.

4510
03:18:17,370 --> 03:18:18,171
He's hilarious.
Yeah,

4511
03:18:18,171 --> 03:18:21,780
I don't take it too well.
I don't think he was probably in the

4512
03:18:21,781 --> 03:18:25,260
middle of a video and someone took a
still of it and use it as a photo or he

4513
03:18:25,261 --> 03:18:27,270
was like,
make sure you get this angle doing

4514
03:18:27,610 --> 03:18:29,190
mobility stuff.
He knows his shit.
