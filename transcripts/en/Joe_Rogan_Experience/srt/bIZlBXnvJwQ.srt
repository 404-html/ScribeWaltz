1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,040
Yeah,

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,030
it's interesting.

4
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:03,721
It's new.

5
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:04,291
It's something,

6
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:05,124
you know,

7
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,360
it's some real,

8
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:06,931
you know,

9
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:09,090
in this world of package to bullshit,

10
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:09,421
you know,

11
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,380
over and over again.

12
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:13,110
Some of these fucking bands
that they're just keep pushing.

13
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,890
It's like,

14
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,250
what is this fucking bullshit
on the highway to fuck?

15
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,540
Speaking of bands,

16
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,201
oh by the way,

17
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,450
we are sponsored by the fleshlight.

18
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:21,780
Um,

19
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,411
so anyway,

20
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,244
we're sponsored by them.

21
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,180
And what we were talking about before
we got into that was this thing on the

22
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:31,860
highway today in Los Angeles there was
a band and was the band called perial

23
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,030
stars imperial stars.

24
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:35,070
Now I didn't know about this.

25
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,300
I lucky I missed this.

26
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,530
I didn't leave the house today,

27
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,370
but um,

28
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,370
when it happened apparently was these
guys got on the highway and they turned

29
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:43,831
their,

30
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,730
their stopped their truck and turned it
sideways so that the create a traffic

31
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,390
jam.

32
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,540
And then they started saying,

33
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,413
yeah,

34
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,460
the biggest piece of attention whoring
may be anyone's ever done stood on the

35
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,020
truck playing music by the way.

36
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,800
Like they had like full now these dumb
motherfuckers probably thought that this

37
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,221
was like,

38
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,960
this is like the opening
scene in our movie,

39
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,470
man.

40
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,071
This is it.

41
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,810
It's like they were so wild.

42
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,220
Like this is how they got discovered.

43
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,490
They got on top of the truck and they
stopped traffic and the fucking music was

44
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,210
so good.

45
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,680
People who didn't care man get it.

46
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,031
Yeah.

47
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,150
And the crazy thing is,

48
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,220
is they actually,

49
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,390
I listened to the song,

50
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,260
I don't know if you've heard it.

51
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:20,094
I have not heard it.

52
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,930
If I want to hate them,

53
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,231
I know.

54
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:24,270
If it was really good
I would have been like,

55
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:24,691
damn,

56
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:27,570
there's no way it could be really
good cause it's w it was really good.

57
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,620
They wouldn't be willing to do this.

58
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,660
It just makes you have to be a Douche bag.

59
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,610
You have to be a Douche bag to want to
stop traffic and get on the news and do

60
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:37,800
all this at other people's expense.

61
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,041
Right.

62
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,100
Because you want to be known
for your fucking music.

63
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,050
Fuck you.

64
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,860
Especially in this city
where that fucking row.

65
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,560
What about people who are
on the way to the hospital?

66
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,560
What about people were on the
way to serious emergencies?

67
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,480
What about people that lost
their job because of you?

68
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,620
That was the one day that were
late again over the mark are,

69
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:55,980
you know,

70
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,000
maybe if it had a fucking thing,

71
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,200
if you're late again this month you're
fired and they were fired because you

72
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,230
fuck you dude.

73
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,040
Even if the song is all about
traffic on the one on one,

74
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,761
that's the bad thing.

75
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:09,420
That's the song is all about and what
sucks is that every news place it's going

76
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,680
to talk about this and you know,

77
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:13,740
there's so many dumb asses out there
that's going to like fall for this whole

78
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:15,230
trick and they're going to become their,

79
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,500
their Twitter account went up today.

80
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,060
I'm assuming a bit that I maybe,

81
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,110
I'm sure they did.

82
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,010
I'd probably fall.

83
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,441
Listen,

84
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,450
I would have hope for the,

85
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,810
they'll say something really stupid,

86
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,930
but I mean that we just have to
discourage that kind of shit.

87
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,980
You can't do that,

88
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:29,610
man.

89
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,121
You can't.

90
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:30,331
You know,

91
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:34,200
it's one thing if you want to do something
for publicity and it doesn't fuck

92
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,610
with everybody else's life,

93
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,030
but when you want to do something like
that in La and you want to stop traffic,

94
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,280
just so that you get
a tension essentially,

95
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,750
like this is how we're going to make it,

96
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,320
man,

97
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,440
this is brilliant publicity style.

98
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,560
Like you guys are idiots.

99
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,880
That's an idiot move,

100
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:48,210
man.

101
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,043
It sucks.

102
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,831
And look,

103
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,101
you know,

104
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:53,640
maybe a bounce back from it and you maybe
you fucked up and maybe you guys were

105
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,430
all high on coke and it
seems like an awesome idea.

106
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,710
I'm not saying you shitty human beings.

107
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,590
You fucked though.

108
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,453
You want to hear this song

109
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,190
is fucking song.

110
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,053
Right?

111
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,090
Wow.

112
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,923
Okay.

113
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,520
All right.

114
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,220
Now actually I,

115
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,053
hold on,

116
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,001
I forgot.

117
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,260
I can't do that on this computer.

118
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,340
Remember it gets right.

119
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,260
I can't get him to do it on the IPAD.

120
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,420
Yeah.

121
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,253
Hold on a second.

122
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,600
So,

123
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,450
uh,

124
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,850
talk about some joy.

125
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,083
Listen man,

126
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,200
I totally understand the appeal for all
of these reality shows where all these

127
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,970
people become famous for no reason.

128
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,841
And then people go,

129
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,531
fuck man,

130
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,140
it's all just about getting eyes on
you and then once you get eyes on you,

131
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,570
you can be a business and you
can even use that for good.

132
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,570
You can go on Oprah Style and fucking
save the world with all the money.

133
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,081
You know?

134
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,550
Maybe Kim Kardashians is going to do that,

135
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:47,350
so maybe all this will
become a good thing.

136
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,260
But the,

137
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,450
because of that,

138
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,920
people are trying to find ways to get
attention outside of the normal shit

139
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,820
outside of being recognized for
something recognized for what you do.

140
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,460
You know this fucking
Dee aunt word is perfect.

141
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,540
However you say it.

142
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,750
Diane would die at Word Diet Ward.

143
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,530
That rap band.

144
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,010
We were playing it.

145
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,610
We don't,

146
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,180
we haven't,

147
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,560
there's no publicity stunts.

148
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:09,280
There's nothing.

149
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,320
They didn't fucking
start a fire in a mall.

150
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,250
All they did was make bad ass music and
it got on youtube and everybody's like,

151
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:15,461
dude,

152
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,360
this is the shit.

153
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:16,991
Check this out.

154
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,010
This is fucking cool.

155
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,390
It's real smart.

156
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,060
They did it to the whole clip
is like two minutes long.

157
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,860
Is this the song dude in?

158
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,160
It's really poor green screen effects.

159
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:28,841
Okay.

160
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,674
So it's a,

161
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,640
this is really low.

162
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:51,474
Can we turn it off?

163
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,040
[inaudible]

164
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,413
stuck in

165
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,553
traffic.

166
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,880
So it sounds,

167
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,960
it sounds like to me it's like a
fake video used inside a movie.

168
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,220
You know,

169
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,280
like tropic thunder,

170
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,790
look at this new video that's on.

171
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,610
It's fun.

172
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,600
That's what it sounds like to me.

173
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,000
Perfect way of describing it,

174
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:39,991
dude.

175
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:42,640
That is the perfect way
to describe fake videos.

176
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,760
They're playing musicians,

177
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,360
right?

178
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,810
Yeah,

179
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,211
exactly.

180
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,610
They do look like you even had a wig on.

181
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,250
Two got fabulous hair.

182
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,603
Don't hate,

183
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,290
I think,

184
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:52,680
um,

185
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,981
yeah,

186
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:53,311
they're,

187
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,110
they sounded like they're
playing musicians.

188
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,590
I just hope there's no
trying to get famous it bad.

189
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,271
I mean it was,

190
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,390
I couldn't say it was terrible.

191
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,400
I just hope there's another
like copy catters you know,

192
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:01,670
like,

193
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,380
oh Mike Acoustic people,

194
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:03,710
you know,

195
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,210
putting their bikes in
the middle of a highway.

196
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,790
You got to talk people,

197
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,760
we hit that guy might have
started something and you know,

198
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,680
the economy is bad,

199
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,820
but what the fuck people,

200
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,420
yeah.

201
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,253
You know,

202
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,890
damn,

203
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,150
what if that does happen?

204
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,710
What do people started
doing that all the time now?

205
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,440
I think they're going to make a,

206
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,160
make an example out of these guys,

207
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,490
they're probably going to
charge them a lot of money.

208
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,770
Yeah.

209
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,900
What if it's nothing?

210
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,530
What if it's like,

211
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:24,831
no,

212
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:27,670
it's gotta be something that's got to
be something big because they blocked

213
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:28,190
traffic.

214
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,060
That's like a felony.

215
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,470
I think what they did for publicity's,

216
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,720
I think it's fairly serious,

217
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,320
right?

218
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,791
I think,

219
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,250
um,

220
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,480
I think they could go to jail.

221
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,110
It's actually possible they go
to jail for something like that.

222
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,590
Like unlawful restraint.

223
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,401
You're an offer restraint.

224
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:40,580
Yeah.

225
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,850
You can put like a kidnapping charge on
danger to you put human beings danger to

226
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,250
your clothes off the highways and make,

227
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,160
make it tough for people
to get around ambulances.

228
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,460
You know,

229
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,450
someone's dad could have
died because you know,

230
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:54,050
there's a heart attack and they rushed
him to the hospital and they can't get

231
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,780
there in time because you fucking
decided to sing in the road.

232
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,730
You can't fuck you.

233
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,750
You know,

234
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,620
that's just dumb.

235
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,371
And everybody,

236
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,060
you know,

237
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,560
everybody should react
the same way to them.

238
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,430
Even if you like him.

239
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,811
He's like,

240
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:04,880
oh,

241
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,870
that was a dumb move,

242
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:06,410
man.

243
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,090
There's just something so not cool.

244
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:10,580
Something should start from
this like it's a new tradition.

245
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:11,990
Every time you see these guys in public,

246
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,160
you have to throw a tomato at them.

247
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,110
They should charge them for
everybody that was late.

248
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,340
Think about all the people that were late,

249
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,410
thousands and thousands of
people that were late there.

250
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,350
Their employers have to pay the person
for the time that they weren't even at

251
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,710
work because they were stuck in a
traffic jam because these assholes,

252
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:24,544
they should all like,

253
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,100
they should like,

254
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,330
they could stack all that up.

255
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,111
They should like find out,

256
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:27,291
okay,

257
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:27,771
what do you get?

258
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:28,880
You get $50 an hour.

259
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,530
All right,

260
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,390
this guy gets 20 bucks
an hour and this guy,

261
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,320
okay,

262
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,130
45 minutes and we'll
calculate it up and you know,

263
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:35,481
and Oh,

264
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,010
you owe $1 million.

265
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:37,820
You Fuck?

266
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,031
Yeah.

267
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:40,910
This guy was auditioning for iron man
for he could've made this much money.

268
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,060
Yeah,

269
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,891
you crazy.

270
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:43,130
Yeah.

271
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,963
You could get crazy.

272
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,710
Like I had a fishing in a dream.

273
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,270
I knew it was going to happen for me.

274
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,030
Everything in my vision was
absolutely perfect and true,

275
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,360
except you decided to sing
on the fucking freeway.

276
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,020
What would have been smarter if they
hired these guys at these guys were

277
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,100
homeless guys and they were,

278
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,130
they made like this fake video up just
to make it look like they were the ones

279
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:01,491
singing.

280
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,950
But the real band hired these
people to get in trouble,

281
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,920
to go to jail so they wouldn't
get in trouble I think.

282
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,880
And the problem with a band like that,

283
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,250
is it anybody that would come
up with a stunt like that,

284
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,690
it's not going to be good.

285
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,350
Right?

286
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,101
You're just not going to be good.

287
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:13,290
Right.

288
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,900
Because obviously aren't famous yet.

289
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,381
What's not?

290
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:16,021
And even not the,

291
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:16,870
you're not famous yet.

292
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,130
Obviously there's a lot of
good bands that aren't famous.

293
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,460
It's about being famous in the music
business is a fucking weird thing.

294
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,930
It doesn't really make sense.

295
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,220
It's not that easy.

296
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,113
It's tricky,

297
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,571
you know,

298
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:26,931
it's like,

299
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,100
but with the Internet,

300
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,890
like look at this word thing,

301
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,370
you can get famous.

302
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,660
You just have to put something together.

303
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,130
And their shit was cheap.

304
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,701
I mean it wasn't,

305
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:35,241
there was nothing.

306
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:35,460
No.

307
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,201
For the high tech,

308
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,940
nothing to it from South Africa.

309
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:38,774
We know about him.

310
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,873
Oh Man.

311
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,540
I mean he did.

312
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,690
They did it right.

313
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:42,861
You know,

314
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:43,131
it's,

315
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,790
but it's,

316
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,470
it's tricky like to try to like get
record sales and shit and get in the door

317
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,180
and get played on the
radio and everything.

318
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,200
It's like man,

319
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,540
it's a fucking funky business.

320
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,520
And it got gutted because
of the MP3S online.

321
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,010
Like the music business
is a state of shambles.

322
00:08:59,011 --> 00:08:59,844
You know,

323
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,470
it's interesting with something like this,

324
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,080
Dee aunt word comes in
and shakes things up,

325
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,140
but it's annoying when you see
the other manifestations of it,

326
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,360
like these assholes with their
fucking bus on the highway.

327
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,793
It's just,

328
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,760
it's just sad that someone
would decide to do that.

329
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,520
That you would be so
fucking selfish and stupid.

330
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,210
You would want to block off a
main route just so that you could,

331
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,073
you know,

332
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,520
make it man,

333
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,770
the kid fucking make it.

334
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,480
Wow.

335
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,701
I mean,

336
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,800
what are the odds those guys
aren't annoying as fuck.

337
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,091
Here's a,

338
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:29,760
here's a quote.

339
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,760
The band describes themselves as
rock stars living on the edge.

340
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,740
They're known for getting crazy
and hanging out with their friends.

341
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,760
That's a real quote.

342
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,800
Shut the fuck up.

343
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:41,910
I swear to God.

344
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,680
Fucking La times.com.

345
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,401
I'm reading it right now.

346
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,230
What the fuck up the band?

347
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,251
The band.

348
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,420
This is a subtle colony.

349
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:48,781
Wait a minute.

350
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:49,770
I'm starting to like them.

351
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm starting to become a thing.

352
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,500
I think I just became a thing.

353
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,180
No,

354
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,480
wait,

355
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,250
is it 180 degree turn around?

356
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,800
This is a subtle comedy.

357
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,820
My bad internet.

358
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,230
This is a subtle comedy,

359
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,010
Dude.

360
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,580
No,

361
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,990
I think we're missing out.

362
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,470
We're missing.

363
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,340
I'm on La time.

364
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,830
Dot.

365
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,350
Where's this funny quotes about three
sentences and members arrested after

366
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,910
blocking one-on-one freeway.

367
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,803
Okay.

368
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,200
That la times blogs and I
want you to read it now,

369
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,771
but I want you to read it.

370
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:20,610
How they wrote it too.

371
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,900
Oh my God.

372
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:23,701
Where's,

373
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:24,534
where's yours?

374
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,431
Is it the same way?

375
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:26,200
I emailed it.

376
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,240
Same way you mount it to your here.

377
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,074
You want to look at it right here?

378
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,540
Yeah.

379
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,373
Okay.

380
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,650
The band describes itself,

381
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,470
says rock stars.

382
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:33,610
Now.

383
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,810
This is an all caps with
an exclamation point.

384
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,343
Oh,

385
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,660
living on the edge.

386
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,080
They're known for getting crazy
and hanging out with their friends.

387
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,331
Okay.

388
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:50,331
It says they debuted in 2010
with a hardcore hip hop album,

389
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,111
but wait a minute.

390
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:55,620
Are they rock stars or are
they hardcore hip hop artists?

391
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,760
They can do anything.

392
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,600
That is crazy.

393
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,950
Is that a new thing that's going on now?

394
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,360
Like hip hop and rock?

395
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,500
It's just this all together.

396
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,860
It's just a setting and garage band
nowadays so they can do anything they

397
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,490
wanted.

398
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,140
Is that what it is?

399
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,973
Yeah.

400
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,940
The band describes itself.

401
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,571
I'll say this again.

402
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:14,571
For those of you who haven't crashed your
fucking cars in furious white knuckled

403
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,320
anger at these cunts.

404
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,480
The Ben described itself as rock
stars live in the on the edge.

405
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,680
They're known for getting crazy
and hanging out with their friends.

406
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,990
That's a real quality.

407
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,210
He's seen the truck to that that
was pulled over that was like,

408
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,630
oh,

409
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,800
it looks like Wayne's world

410
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,340
fucking picture of them.

411
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,900
It looks like something
from Wayne's world.

412
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:37,591
It looks vague.

413
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:38,640
It doesn't even look real.

414
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,110
I hope this is not a movie.

415
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,970
It might be.

416
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,050
They might be brilliant.

417
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,340
It seems like it is.

418
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,601
Like I said,

419
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:45,961
like I said,

420
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,970
it seemed like a fake
band inside of a movie.

421
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,290
What full thing is a fake hand?

422
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,603
I bet it is.

423
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,683
I bet it is.

424
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,410
There just is.

425
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:52,680
No.

426
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,020
Well,

427
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,730
if they are,

428
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,520
come on man,

429
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,420
then they're really fucked because if
they make a movie and they closed the

430
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,490
highway down for a movie like that.

431
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,150
Yeah.

432
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,983
No,

433
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,420
I don't believe that because first of all,

434
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:05,710
you would have cameras everywhere.

435
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,970
You'd have real cameras.

436
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,330
He wouldn't have a fucking little youtube
cameras or they're going to do a stunt

437
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,110
like this.

438
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,590
They're going to have to
have like real permits.

439
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:12,881
But look,

440
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,050
how could that photo is?

441
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,711
It's crazy.

442
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:15,070
Photos.

443
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,903
Perfect.

444
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,440
They turn the car sideways,

445
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,340
turned sideways.

446
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,330
It's perfect lighting.

447
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,164
It's perfect.

448
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,020
It even looks like it kind of caught Tam.

449
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:22,721
And if this is a movie,

450
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:23,620
I want to be really mad.

451
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,620
I'm already mad.

452
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,453
This devil mad.

453
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,810
Um,

454
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,080
I,

455
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm hoping that these guys
were like Andy Kaufman.

456
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,021
They'll just,

457
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,150
he's brilliant artists.

458
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:31,361
You know,

459
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,194
you're not like that.

460
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,240
The quote is so bad.

461
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,410
This band describes itself as rock stars.

462
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,400
This is all in caps,

463
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,540
living on the edge.

464
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,390
They're known for getting crazy
and hanging out with their friends.

465
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,690
Right?

466
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,310
That's what they're known for is this guy.

467
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,173
My neighborhood,

468
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,200
this guy,

469
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,340
he's fucking crazy.

470
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,600
He hangs out with his friends.

471
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,010
That's how you say it.

472
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,410
Like you lived in Glendale though.

473
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,450
If they totally changed
the whole sentence,

474
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,490
you'll member walks.

475
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,820
Doves were living on the edge.

476
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,181
You know,

477
00:12:58,181 --> 00:12:58,720
they're getting,

478
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,840
we'd like to get crazy and hanging with
the blue or Flynn's not an Armenian guy.

479
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,201
You're doing,

480
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:02,601
what is that?

481
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,810
I sense that a Swedish Swedish.

482
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,550
Wow.

483
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,300
Um,

484
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,791
I listen,

485
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,870
I think that these guys,

486
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,763
uh,

487
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,040
if,

488
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,050
if this is a scam and if this is just a,

489
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,003
a hustle,

490
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,500
then I dunno,

491
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm on the fence.

492
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,560
I'm on the fence now.

493
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,380
It's not like if they decided
to make a bad band on purpose,

494
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,950
I might think this is pretty fucking,

495
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,770
if the song was good.

496
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,351
That's what I was saying.

497
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,040
Remember when we went to
see that band steel panther?

498
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,361
That was good music.

499
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,600
Fucking awesome music if
you haven't seen those guys.

500
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,530
Steel Panther or this,

501
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:35,170
they do this like eighties um,

502
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,510
thing where they play like all the,

503
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,710
like the best eighties rock and they,

504
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,750
the dude does the most insane
Ozzy Osborne impression man.

505
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,740
And it's all like hair,

506
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,370
metal stuff.

507
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,203
It's all like,

508
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,601
you know,

509
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:46,860
like,

510
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,100
and,

511
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,130
and it's good man.

512
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:52,990
It's good music but it's like this
like hilarious good music parody on.

513
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:54,910
But you love it because you
know they're a fake band,

514
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,121
right?

515
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:55,810
You know,

516
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,643
but they're good.

517
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,060
These guys,

518
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,350
what if they are fake Ben too?

519
00:13:59,390 --> 00:13:59,720
But they,

520
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,260
but they didn't do the good part of
the music so it doesn't go together.

521
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:02,981
It doesn't work.

522
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,720
It has to actually cause cause cause I,

523
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,430
if I liked these guys and I respect,

524
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:08,620
I'm actually have to get
into their music and I'm not,

525
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,570
what am I going to hang out with these
guys and become friends with them,

526
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:10,790
whatever.

527
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,690
It's just this brilliant performance
piece which just make the worst,

528
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:14,920
most cliche,

529
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,420
bland,

530
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,440
dumb wrap.

531
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,800
And we'll do it with like a
lot of confidence and let's
see if we could sell it.

532
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,240
What if they just want to make friends?

533
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,530
Maybe this is just a friend thing.

534
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:23,920
Like they,

535
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,370
they,

536
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,360
you won't like their music,

537
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,550
but they just want be your friend while
they do hang out with their friends,

538
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,393
they're known for that.

539
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,320
They're known for getting crazy
and hanging out with her friends.

540
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,120
Right.

541
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,330
It's a big friend thing.

542
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,180
How many people right now are
going to change their Avatar,

543
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,810
their fucking signature under their
Avatar on the road board now too.

544
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,140
He's known for getting crazy and
hanging out with his friends.

545
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,730
You fucking dummy.

546
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,320
You shut up dummy.

547
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,580
It makes God dammit everybody's doe.

548
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,120
Yeah.

549
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,361
And they,

550
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:55,820
because of this band Joey
did wasn't here today.

551
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,750
Yeah.

552
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,860
This fucking band.

553
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:57,981
The,

554
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:58,970
these cut holes,

555
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,380
when they decided to do that,

556
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,430
Joey Diaz is a,

557
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,340
he was filming something today and it
wasn't gonna be able to make it over and

558
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:05,210
Tom with traffic.

559
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,910
So we flew solo because he,

560
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:07,071
you,

561
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:07,904
you twats

562
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,010
okay.
