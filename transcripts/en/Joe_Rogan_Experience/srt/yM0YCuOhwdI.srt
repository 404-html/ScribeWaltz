00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,601
Shocking.

3
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,750
There's two shocking things that these
pills have done for me is for you to

4
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:07,530
remember one,

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,740
remembering dreams and to being
lucid in the middle of a dream.

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,570
I stayed in a dream.

7
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,400
I was in a dream and
I stayed in the dream.

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:14,880
I said,

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,530
oh well this is just a fucking dream.

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,513
And I just,

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,600
I didn't even go lucid.

12
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,520
Like I didn't try to
control it or move around.

13
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,930
I just let the dream play out.

14
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,970
But I realized it was a dream
and I still didn't wake up.

15
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,510
I have,

16
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,010
that's a rare thing for me
just for that chef dreams.

17
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:29,844
I have dreams.

18
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,920
I have been fucking crazy dreams,

19
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,090
but I am totally lucid inside my dreams.

20
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,750
Dreams that I'm reading
something and I'll go,

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,470
I'll be,

22
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:37,861
I'll go,

23
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,071
wow,

24
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,950
that's so funny that I'm reading something
because nothing's there in the dream.

25
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,700
I'll pick this.

26
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,920
Nothing's there in my minds
making up these words,

27
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,970
but I'm still reading them.

28
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:45,870
That's so interesting.

29
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,650
I had a dream one time that me and Elvis
walked into his hotel room and there

30
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,431
were four dudes,

31
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,510
but fucking right.

32
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,700
And I just hear me where they were.

33
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,930
That might be one of the
best sentences ever created.

34
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,240
I had a dream that I was with Elvis
and we walked into his dressing room.

35
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,300
There was four dudes,

36
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,740
but fucking dot,

37
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:05,101
dot,

38
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:05,550
dot.

39
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,550
Now hear me out it weird
or they're throwing up in
Burger King cups should just

40
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,380
fucking each other and then I,

41
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,301
where do you,

42
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:15,961
when I say this,

43
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:18,390
I fucking just shut the
door and I looked at Elvis.

44
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:18,601
I go,

45
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,860
what the fuck's going on in your room?

46
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,213
He said to me,

47
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,760
what's your Dream Baby Shit?

48
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,351
I wake up,

49
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:28,921
I wake up.

50
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:29,550
I'm like,

51
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,001
wake up.

52
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:30,900
Check my Dick and make sure it's,

53
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,734
I'm bored.

54
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,931
I'm like,

55
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:35,130
well you don't really flipped me out.

56
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,240
You don't really put me out.

57
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,130
Not that.

58
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,040
Not that the guys were both fucking right.

59
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,380
They didn't ask.

60
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:43,710
No.

61
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,230
It was the product placement like what
the fuck did Burger King do to get it?

62
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,450
When did they figured it out and you just
don't know that they are just waiting

63
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,530
Jack to advertising into your
Dream Burger King in the future.

64
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:58,831
Right now.

65
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:02,040
It's like I got her Chrysler stream about
the Elvis and the buck fucking high,

66
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:02,520
Huh?

67
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,750
No,

68
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:02,971
no,

69
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,181
no,

70
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:03,361
no.

71
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:03,750
But what is,

72
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,750
there is a possibility that someone
could insert a product into a dream,

73
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,600
right?

74
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,720
They could give you a cheeseburger
and in that cheeseburger with some

75
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:17,340
experimental thing that would make you
think about burger king in a dream and

76
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,660
see a burger and a dream,

77
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,051
you can do it.

78
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:19,590
You can do it.

79
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,940
I fucking girl from behind.

80
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,230
It's going Geico and shit.

81
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,300
Yes.

82
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Work in the future.

83
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,720
But that doesn't make any sense cause
you have the Pronto duck noises.

84
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,310
It's Geico to eat something,

85
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,390
to have this happen to you.

86
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,500
We're still,

87
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,920
we're still missing the whole point.

88
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,010
We're stumbling on something
very brilliant right now.

89
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,270
Yeah.
