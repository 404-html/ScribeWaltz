1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,710
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,060
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,770
one.
Hello,

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:08,760
Jordan Peterson.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,990
Hello.
Mr.

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,210
Rogen very spiffy today.
Thank you sir.

7
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,740
If this is a new look for you,
you're,

8
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,540
you've been rocking these,
a lot of these big,

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,010
gigantic,
uh,

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,190
what do you call those things?
These concerts that you guys are doing?

11
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,810
What do you speeches?
Well,

12
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,570
lectures.
Discussions is what I think of them as.

13
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,710
Yeah,
I'm discussing.

14
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,150
I mean,
you might think it's kind of perverse to

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,450
be discussing with a 3000 person 
audience,

16
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:35,390
but it's not because if you pay 
attention to the audience,

17
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,490
they're constantly in the individuals in
the audience.

18
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,324
They're constantly providing feedback.
So it's a discussion as far as I'm 

19
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:42,720
concerned.

20
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,990
Feedback in applause.
Laughter.

21
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,080
Sometimes they shout things out to 
shuffling.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,070
Shuffling.
Yeah.

23
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,590
Well really what you want.
If you're on track,

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,513
if you're where you should be,
then it's dead silent and everyone's 

25
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:59,450
focused and listening.
And so if that's not happening,

26
00:00:59,451 --> 00:00:59,931
I mean,
you know,

27
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:01,460
there can be laughter and that kind of 
thing,

28
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,294
but generally speaking,
you don't want to hear noise from the 

29
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:07,230
audience.
So if you're,

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,103
if you're,
if you're pursuing a complicated topic 

31
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:11,784
and you're paying attention and I'm 
always looking at individual people in 

32
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,511
the audience,
you know,

33
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,344
and the first few rows because that's 
all I can see because of the lights and 

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,130
trying to make sure that everyone's on 
track with the talk and you know,

35
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:24,964
there's people just hear what their face
and they gestured with your eyes and 

36
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,110
they shake their head and they nod and 
there's lots of things to pick up and if

37
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:32,944
you're not speaking with notes,
you can really pay attention to the 

38
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,590
audience.
And then you know,

39
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,930
if you're in the dialog and that's where
everyone wants to

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,880
to be.
Yeah.

41
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,714
It's an interesting thing you're doing 
because you have experienced in doing 

42
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,930
that with lectures and colleges and 
universities.

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,793
But now it's the general public and 
people just pay to see it and you fill 

44
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:54,870
up these huge gigantic theaters.
I mean,

45
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:57,210
I've seen some of the places that you 
guys are doing it.

46
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,910
Even Sam just got done doing one in 
Vancouver and she huge places to,

47
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,470
to back to back.
And he asked.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,060
It was about five hours of

49
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,470
intense discussion over two days and you
know,

50
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,040
we were supposed to talk for an hour 
each night and then go to q and a,

51
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,850
but we asked the audience,
Bret Weinstein,

52
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,400
who was moderating,
ask the audience if they wanted to go to

53
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:22,220
q and a or continue the discussion and 
you know,

54
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:25,940
the response from the crowd was 
definitely continued that discussion and

55
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:30,110
so we ended up talking for about two and
a half hours each night and again it was

56
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,010
the audiences along for the ride,
you know,

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,240
and they were good discussions as far as
I'm concerned,

58
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,573
you know,
it was kind of marketed as a take down 

59
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:44,111
in some sense Harris versus Peterson.
But the discussion itself was an attempt

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,373
on Sam's part and my part to further our
thinking about the topic and to bring 

61
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,320
everyone along for the ride,
you know,

62
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,270
for the journey so to speak.

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,133
Yeah.
Well you guys had two podcasts that you 

64
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,670
did over the phone,
so this,

65
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,010
these were the first meetings that you 
guys hadn't person.

66
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,903
It was the first time I'd met Sam.
He said the first one that you two had 

67
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:12,631
was marred by this discussion about what
is truth and it was a strange sort of a,

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,070
okay,
you got stuck.

69
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,380
You guys got kind of stuck in that first
conversation,

70
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,390
but I felt like the second one was much 
better.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Yes.
He in both of you,

72
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,490
kind of recognize that there were some 
errors made in the first podcast.

73
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,683
Yeah,
we agree on a definition in and let it 

74
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:30,474
go and so that wasn't so good and I 
wasn't in tip top shape for that first 

75
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,050
discussion while over the second one for
that matter,

76
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,423
but they've been getting.
Each discussion I've had with Sam has 

77
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:43,320
been getting better,
so as far as I'm concerned,

78
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,960
and I think he feels the same way and I 
mean we're taught,

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,430
we're trying to sort something out 
that's really,

80
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:48,264
really difficult and it's the 
relationship between facts and values 

81
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,790
which is parallel to the relationship 
between say,

82
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,624
objective truth and narrative or 
parallel to the distinction between 

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,973
scientific fact and religious truth.
All of those things sort of are layered 

84
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:06,660
on top of each other and it's an 
extraordinarily difficult topic.

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,913
And so it's not surprising that it's 
taking all of this discussion to even 

86
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,334
vaguely get it straight.
It's been a central bone of contention 

87
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:16,650
among philosophers for,
well probably forever,

88
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:20,310
but certainly since the time of,
of David Hume several hundred years.

89
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,783
Well,
one of the more fascinating things is 

90
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,840
coming out of the realm of podcasting is
these kind of discussions,

91
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:30,010
these long form live discussions in 
front of enormous groups of people where

92
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,100
you go over very complex issues.
It's a new thing.

93
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,930
I mean,
and it's a,

94
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,380
it's something that's greatly received 
by the public,

95
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,080
which is really interesting.
I mean you guys are selling out all over

96
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:41,620
the place.
Yeah.

97
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,453
Well one one I've really been trying to 
make sense of this say because I'm 

98
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:46,061
thinking,
well,

99
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,380
what the Hell's going on?
Why?

100
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,550
Why am I selling out 3000 person 
auditoriums and then,

101
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,050
and then,
but not just me.

102
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:57,250
Obviously Sam is doing it and you're 
doing something on a larger scale,

103
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,010
but very similar with your long form 
podcasts and,

104
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,990
and,
and then there's this whole rise of,

105
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,010
of what Barry Weiss described as the 
intellectual dark web.

106
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,873
That's actually Eric Weinstein's coinage
and so there's a group of us that have 

107
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,930
been sort of clump together for,
for reasons that aren't obvious,

108
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,960
but I've been trying to figure that out 
as I do these lectures.

109
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,900
Another thing I'm doing with the 
lectures or the discussions is trying to

110
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,540
continually further the development of 
my ideas.

111
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,880
I use the,
the,

112
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,380
the stage I'd say as a,
as a,

113
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,170
uh,
opportunity in real time to think.

114
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,680
And I've been thinking,
well,

115
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:32,514
if you're surfing,
you don't confuse yourself with the 

116
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:35,040
wave,
right?

117
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,500
That that's a real mistake.
He might be on top of the wave,

118
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:38,334
but you're not the wave.
And I think this long form discussion 

119
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,610
and the public hunger for that as best 
conceptualized like that,

120
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,040
there's a technological revolution.
It's a deep one.

121
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,263
The technological revolution is online,
video and audio immediately accessible 

122
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:56,640
to everyone all over the world.
And so what that's done is it turned,

123
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,543
it's turned the spoken word into a tool 
that has the same reach as the printed 

124
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,054
word.
So it's a Gutenberg revolution in the 

125
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,544
domain of video and audio and it might 
be even deeper than the original 

126
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:11,600
Gutenberg revolution because it isn't 
obvious how many people can read,

127
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,930
but lots of people can listen and now it
turns out so he got a little bit of that

128
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:17,960
with TV,
right?

129
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,790
And you got a little bit of it with 
radio,

130
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,700
but there was bandwidth limitations that
were really stringent,

131
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,534
especially in TV where you could get 30 
seconds if you were lucky in six 

132
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,090
minutes,
if you were stellar too,

133
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,100
to elucidate a complicated argument.
So you can't do that.

134
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,950
Everything gets compressed to,
to,

135
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,311
to,
uh,

136
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,144
kind of oversimplified entertainment.
But now all of a sudden we have this 

137
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,790
forum for long form discussion,
real long form discussion.

138
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,520
And it turns out that everyone is way 
smarter than we thought,

139
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,253
right?
We can have these discussions publicly 

140
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:53,400
and there's a great hunger for it.
And I see this parallel.

141
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,450
So,
and this would be,

142
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,390
what would you call it,
supporting evidence for this hypothesis?

143
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,230
The same thing's happened in the 
entertainment world because you know,

144
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,420
tv made us think,
well,

145
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:05,250
we can handle a 20 minute sit,
calm,

146
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,910
or maybe we can handle an hour and a 
half made for TV movie.

147
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,043
But then Netflix came along and Hbo as 
well with the bandwidth restrictions 

148
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,820
gone and all of a sudden it turned out 
that no,

149
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:16,950
no,
we can handle 40.

150
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:20,520
Our complex multilayered narratives 
where the characters shift,

151
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,623
where the complexity starts to reach the
same complexity as great literature and 

152
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:25,584
there's a massive market for it.
And so it turns out that we're smarter 

153
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,424
than our technology revealed to us and I
think those of us who've been placed in 

154
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,950
this intellectual,
dark web group,

155
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,960
you know,
there's some things we have in common.

156
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,483
We more or less have independent voices 
because we're not beholding to any 

157
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:41,784
corporate masters except peripherally 
and we've been operating in this long 

158
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,220
form space and the technology has 
facilitated that.

159
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,540
And so all of a sudden it turns out that
there's more to people than we thought.

160
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,710
And thank God for that.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,620
I'm struggling with.
I want to.

162
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,120
I don't want to use the word hate,
uh,

163
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,160
there,
there seems to be a,

164
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,660
a non acceptance or a resistance to the 
idea that anything of quality could come

165
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:15,120
out of this group of people.
It's really interesting to me and uh,

166
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:15,954
I'm wondering why when I listened to you
speak or Sam or Eric or any of these 

167
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:21,794
people,
ben or Dave and I hear very interesting 

168
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:27,470
points and I'm like,
why are people resisting that?

169
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,510
These are interesting points.
Why are they resisting this?

170
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,943
And I think there's a lot of people that
are beholden to mainstream 

171
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:35,654
organizations,
whether it's newspapers or magazines or 

172
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:42,971
television shows that feel trapped.
I think they feel trapped by this format

173
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,104
that they're stuck in.
It's a very limiting format and it's a 

174
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,420
format that,
in my opinion is like,

175
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,570
I mean,
it might as well be smoke signals or ham

176
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:54,500
radio or something.

177
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,070
It's fucking,
it's dumb.

178
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,070
You know,
this,

179
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,903
this idea that we're going to go to 
commercials every 15 minutes and you 

180
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:01,204
know,
and in between you have 15 people 

181
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,541
arguing.
I mean,

182
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,374
I watched a panel on CNN wants and I 
think we counted 10 people that were 

183
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,720
trying to talk during this five minute 
segment.

184
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,770
I'm like,
who,

185
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,603
what genius thought that it would be a 
good idea to get 10 people struggling 

186
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:18,984
for air time barking over each other.
No one saying anything that makes any 

187
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:23,364
sense because everybody's talking over 
and trying to stand out and trying to 

188
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,174
say the most outrageous things and I'm 
seeing like some of the resistance to 

189
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:36,090
this when we spend pretty far,
you know,

190
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,150
from Sam and I lean more left and Ben 
Leans more right and your,

191
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,540
what you would call a classic liberal.
And Eric's very difficult to define.

192
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,380
And Brett is fiercely progressive.
I mean these are Brett Breton,

193
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,253
particularly very left wing guy,
but this desire to label and to have 

194
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:59,100
this diminishing label is like,
all right,

195
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,600
or you know,
right wing or fascist.

196
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,020
It's,
it's very strange.

197
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,023
Yeah.
Well there's a couple of things going 

198
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:06,494
on.
I think one of them is that the 

199
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:09,944
technological transformation that I laid
out and then the other is that I do 

200
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:16,400
believe that especially for the radical 
leftist types,

201
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,234
the whole notion of free speech among 
individuals is not only anathema but 

202
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,340
also something that isn't possible 
within their framework of reference.

203
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,630
I've been trying to think this through 
very carefully because you know,

204
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:30,464
for free speech in some senses become 
identified as a right wing issue and I 

205
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:34,011
thought,
well,

206
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,290
how the hell did that happen?
And then I thought,

207
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,440
Oh yes.
Well if you're radically left and you're

208
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:40,274
playing the identity politics game,
there's actually no such thing as free 

209
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,334
speech because you're only the 
mouthpiece of your group whether you 

210
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,780
know it or not.
So you don't get to talk.

211
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,330
As Joe Rogan.
You get to talk as like Joe Rogan,

212
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,740
Patriarchal White Guy.

213
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,903
Knots it and your audiences aren't a 
reflection of your own opinions as an 

214
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:57,164
individual,
but they're an attempt on your part 

215
00:10:59,121 --> 00:10:59,954
whether you know it or not,
to justify your position and the power 

216
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:05,150
hierarchy.
And so everything right now,

217
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,540
and this is where the technology and the
death of the mainstream media and,

218
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,520
and this and this political polarization
all unite,

219
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,630
everything is turned into a political 
conversation in the,

220
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,493
in the mainstream media and media,
and it has to be cast as left versus 

221
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,554
right.
And if you're criticizing the left and 

222
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:27,140
all of a sudden you're right and right 
wing and it has to be about politics.

223
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:27,681
It's like,
well,

224
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:30,680
it doesn't have to be politics,
it could be about philosophy,

225
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,230
it doesn't have to be cast in political 
terms.

226
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,400
And,
and then it's also subject to a form of,

227
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,970
of,
of well it,

228
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:44,030
it's made more stupid than it has to be 
by these terrible bandwidth limitations.

229
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:44,811
Like,
I mean,

230
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:49,520
I've been on mainstream TV talk shows 
and it's very strange experience because

231
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,610
you're definitely content.
You know,

232
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,790
Marshall Mcluhan said the medium is the 
message,

233
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,624
right?
The medium shapes the dialogue and it 

234
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,070
doesn't integrate,
integrate in,

235
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,980
in,
in,

236
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,630
in a tremendous way,
powerful way.

237
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,990
You go on a TV talk show and maybe it's 
an hour long,

238
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,883
something like that.
And there's five guests and you've got 

239
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,370
your eight minutes,
something like that,

240
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,820
and you have to be bright and chipper 
and entertaining and intelligent,

241
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,683
sort of glitzy,
and it puts that facade of momentary 

242
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,640
charisma on you.
And if you don't play that out,

243
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:20,590
you actually fail,
right?

244
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:23,740
Because you can't start a long form 
discussion when you've got six minutes.

245
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,250
And if you're trying to talk about 
something that's deep and difficult,

246
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,713
well you want to talk about it because 
you've got the access they had and the 

247
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,270
opportunity,
but you've got your,

248
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,323
your six minutes,
you can't help but turn into sort of a 

249
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:36,760
glitzy entertainer.

250
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,450
And so it cheapens everything.
And then the other thing that I think is

251
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:44,350
happening is that as the mainstream 
media television in particular dies,

252
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,050
the quality people are starting to 
desert like rats leaving a sinking ship.

253
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,150
I guess they're good routes if they're 
quality people,

254
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,470
but um,
and then the,

255
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,363
the,
there's ever more enticement to use 

256
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,163
clickbait journalism to attract a 
diminishing portion of the remaining 

257
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:02,831
audience.
You know,

258
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:04,720
it's like one of the things that's 
happened.

259
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:05,554
So if you look at the five major indices
of violent crime in the United States 

260
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,830
that they've declined by 50 percent in 
25 years,

261
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,040
it's absolutely beyond comprehension.
It's so good.

262
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,050
This includes violent gun crime by the 
way,

263
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,610
and yet the reports of violence in media
have gone up and up and up and up.

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,421
You think,
well,

265
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:23,560
what's going on?
It's like,

266
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:24,250
well,
it's.

267
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,530
It's,
it's click bait.

268
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,420
It's the.
It's the equivalent of clickbait.

269
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,283
And then to turn everything into a 
polarized political discussion takes no 

270
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:35,550
real intellectual energy,
but it's also driven by the death spiral

271
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:36,960
of the classic media,
I think,

272
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,590
and I think that's actually why the 
polarization seems to be so acute.

273
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,780
Now.
Some of it is genuine,

274
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,093
but some of it is.
Some of it is the consequences of this 

275
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,154
underlying technological transformation 
and the death throes of the smoke 

276
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,510
signals.
Fundamentally

277
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,540
what you're talking about when you're,
when you're saying people,

278
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,374
especially radical leftists,
have to concede certain points whenever 

279
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,124
they discuss things that this is so true
and so important because you see that 

280
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,893
play out over and over again.
There's very little variation from the 

281
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:09,454
official narrative when they talk about 
important subjects or controversial 

282
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:13,744
subjects and whatever they are,
whether it's transgender rights or 

283
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,350
whatever,
whatever's in the news.

284
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,560
It's big and it's very popular right 
now.

285
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,693
There's these,
these certain things that you're not 

286
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:27,964
allowed to deviate from and that that's 
an insanely restrictive perspective and 

287
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,270
it who's establishing these norms like 
who's a staff question man?

288
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,133
Yeah.
Who is it?

289
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,113
I blame.
I blame the universities and large part 

290
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:41,960
for this.
They act this disciplines,

291
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,803
but that's only a partial answer because
the universities are also responding to 

292
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:50,520
legislation like title nine so and so 
and so.

293
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,650
They've been driven into the and title 
nine for people,

294
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:55,100
so title nine,
title nine.

295
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:58,940
Originally it was just a piece of 
legislation that that ensured that women

296
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,780
would have equal access to sports events
and so forth at the universities.

297
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,763
That's what it was designed for,
but it's become this umbrella 

298
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:06,974
legislation that pushes equality of 
outcome essentially across every 

299
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:10,934
possible dimension in the universities 
and it's been used as a weapon by the 

300
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:17,270
radical left,
but some of that's driven by legislative

301
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,104
necessity.

302
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,530
What's happening?
What was the reason that I think this is

303
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:26,170
coming from the universities is because 
I don't think that this could.

304
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,423
Well,
there's all these activists disciplines 

305
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:28,984
that are essentially subsidized by too 
high to tuition fees and also by state 

306
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:35,730
funding and they've produced an entire 
substructure of,

307
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,210
of activists and those activists are 
doing everything they can to lay out the

308
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,280
theoretical structure for the radical 
left.

309
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:44,590
And that's a,
that's a structure that involves.

310
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:45,640
There's buzzwords,
right?

311
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,503
Diversity is one,
but that means diversity by race and 

312
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:51,010
ethnicity and sexual preference,
for example,

313
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,223
as,
as if those have anything to do with 

314
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,290
genuine diversity of idiation and they 
don't.

315
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,020
And there's no evidence that they do 
inclusivity.

316
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:01,370
I've never even sure what that means.
Um,

317
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,030
equity,
which is a marker for,

318
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,953
what would you call it?
It's a code word in some sense for 

319
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,950
equality of outcome,
which is an absolutely deadly doctrine.

320
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,370
I think of all the mistakes that the 
radical left are making and the moderate

321
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,850
left for not calling them out on it.
The equity doctrine is at the top of the

322
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,010
list.
And then there's other associated things

323
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,660
like white privilege.
That's a good one,

324
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:20,494
and systemic bias and which is a.
it's an absolute embarrassment from the 

325
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:26,674
perspective of a of a reasonable 
academic psychologist because 

326
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,183
psychological tests have been used to 
prove that there's this implicit bias 

327
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,450
that that lurks everywhere and the tests
aren't reliable and valid enough to make

328
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:38,284
that claim.
That's even the people who've made the 

329
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:40,444
test.
The implicit association test have 

330
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:42,604
admitted except for Mazda and Banerji,
who's the chairman of the Department of 

331
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,863
Psychology at Harvard.
They've admitted that the tests aren't 

332
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:51,490
reliable and valid enough to be used for
the purposes there'll be using for,

333
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,290
and there's also no evidence at all that
these unconscious buying bias retraining

334
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,840
seminars have any effect whatsoever.
That's positive.

335
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,740
It's all nonsense pushed by this.
The,

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,050
the ideological.
What fulminations of the radical left.

337
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,810
Is there any benefit in having these 
conversations?

338
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,673
Talking about implicit biases and 
recognizing that there's an extreme 

339
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,640
pushback against racism or sexism and 
all these different things and that even

340
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,020
though these things,
these,

341
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,503
these,
these ideas that they're pushing might 

342
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:28,814
not be tested and proven.
The idea of putting it out there in the 

343
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,633
mainstream that there's a shift in 
consciousness in terms of like how 

344
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:41,720
people will or won't accept racism or 
sexism or homophobia or whatever else is

345
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:45,680
being discussed,
that maybe it's far left,

346
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,220
but maybe it's moving the needle towards
where it needs to be.

347
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,180
I think that,

348
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,170
well that I think that happens.
I mean,

349
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,093
I certainly believed that there's space 
and necessity for a constant dialogue 

350
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,254
between the left and the right.
This is also something that I've been 

351
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,040
developing more particularly during 
these lectures,

352
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:02,874
so.
So I'm going to lay out a couple of 

353
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:07,380
propositions.
So imagine that you have to move forward

354
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,840
in the world.
You have to do things and the reason you

355
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,674
have to do things is because while if 
you just sit there and don't do 

356
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,070
anything,
then you suffer and die.

357
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,830
So that isn't an option.
You have to move forward and you have to

358
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,490
move forward towards valued things.
So you have to have the value hierarchy.

359
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,090
It has to be hierarchy because one thing
has to be more important than another,

360
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:26,100
or you can't do anything right.
You're,

361
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,400
you're to split with your choices,
so you have to do things,

362
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,234
you have to value,
you have to value some things more than 

363
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,760
others.

364
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,190
Then you have to act out what you value 
in the social environment because you're

365
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,360
a social creature and you're not going 
to do things alone.

366
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,583
Then as soon as you start to act out 
things of value in the social 

367
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:43,584
environment,
you inevitably produce a hierarchy and 

368
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,640
the reason you do that is because no 
matter what,

369
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:48,474
you're acting out.
Some people are way better at it than 

370
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:51,744
others and and it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter if it's basketball or 

371
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:57,150
hockey or plumbing or law.
Doesn't matter.

372
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,120
As soon as there's something valuable 
and you're doing it collectively,

373
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,740
there's a hierarchy.
Okay,

374
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,630
so then what happens?
Well,

375
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,703
the hierarchy can get corrupt and rigid 
and then it stops rewarding competence 

376
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:11,730
and it starts rewarding criminality and 
power.

377
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,150
And so there's always the danger of the 
hierarchy will become corrupt.

378
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,110
The right wingers say we really need the
hierarchies and we should abide by them.

379
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,230
That's sort of the Motif of patriotism 
and,

380
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,220
and,
and,

381
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,040
and,
and,

382
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,990
and,
and positive group identity.

383
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,310
And the left wingers say,
yeah,

384
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,620
but wait a second,
there's a problem here,

385
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,500
a,
your hierarchy can get corrupt and might

386
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,650
and be because some people are way 
better at it than others.

387
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:37,680
You're going to produce a bunch of 
dispossessed people at the bottom,

388
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,820
and that's not only good for not only 
not good for the dispossessed people,

389
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,920
it actually threatens the whole 
hierarchy.

390
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,220
So you have to be careful.
You have to attend to the widows and the

391
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,620
children,
let's say the widows and the orphans.

392
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,650
Okay?
So now and then,

393
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,910
now you can think about that as an 
eternal problem.

394
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,240
You can't do without hierarchies,
but,

395
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,493
and that's the right wing claim in some 
sense you can't do without hierarchies 

396
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:04,080
and they're valuable,
but they're also prone to corruption and

397
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,190
they dispossessed people.

398
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,470
Okay?
So now that's an eternal problem.

399
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,333
The question is what you do about it.
And the answer to that is there's no 

400
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:11,994
final answer to the problem.
So what you have to do is you have to 

401
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:18,390
have a left wing and you have to have a 
right wing and they have to talk all the

402
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:19,224
time about whether the hierarchy is 
healthy and whether or not it's 

403
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,044
dispossessing too many people.
And then the problem with that is is 

404
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:29,340
that discussion can go too far because 
the right wingers can say hierarchy,

405
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,530
Uber,
all right,

406
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,130
that,
that,

407
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,963
that we've,
the state is correct and everything's 

408
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,950
right.
And so that's the right wing.

409
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:35,784
Totalitarian types and the left can say,
will flatten everything so there's no 

410
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:40,044
inequality.
And so both the left and the right can 

411
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:42,984
go too far.
Now the problem is we don't know how to 

412
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,374
define.
I think one of the problems is we know 

413
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:48,040
how to define

414
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,873
when the right goes too far.
I think we learned that after World War 

415
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,673
II.
I think if you're making claims of 

416
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:53,554
ethnic or racial superiority,
you get to be put in a box and put off 

417
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,550
the shelf,
right?

418
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:58,384
You're not in the dialogue anymore.
It's obvious that the left can go too 

419
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:04,810
far even though they're necessary 
participants in the discussion.

420
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,410
But we don't know when to,
we don't know how to define when they've

421
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,630
gone too far and have an obvious 
example.

422
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:11,081
No.
And,

423
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,190
and,
and you might think,

424
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:14,380
well that's the moderate leftists 
problem.

425
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,393
It's their moral responsibility to 
dissociate themselves from the radicals 

426
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,444
just as it's the moral responsibility of
reasonable conservatives to dissociate 

427
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:25,250
themselves from the Birch John Birch 
and,

428
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,880
and Ku Klux Klan types.
That's a very important point.

429
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,080
But,
but the problem,

430
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,943
but it isn't just the moderate left's 
problem because even the people on the 

431
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:36,250
right don't know what to point to when 
they say no.

432
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,950
You've gone too far as a leftist.
Now I've tried to.

433
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
It's complicated because I think it's 
it.

434
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,123
It might be more than one policy.
I think the really deadly left this 

435
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:46,444
presumption is equality of outcome.
I think as soon as you start talking 

436
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:49,804
about equality of outcome,
you should be put in a box and put off 

437
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:53,040
the shelf.
That's the but.

438
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,380
But it isn't obvious why.
Like that doesn't sound like you know,

439
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,303
white people overall.
It doesn't have the same guttural punch 

440
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,740
that the excess of the right has its 
equality of outcome.

441
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,120
Why is that bad?
Well,

442
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:10,810
it's bad because when you play it out in
society and there's endless evidence for

443
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:11,644
this,
it's an instantaneously murderous 

444
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:17,920
doctrine and I think it's because it 
shifts so quickly into a victim.

445
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:22,270
Victimizer narrative.
I've had a great opportunity in the last

446
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,103
month and a half.
I got asked to write the preface to the 

447
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:29,050
50th anniversary edition of [inaudible] 
since Gulag archipelago,

448
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,920
and so I've been writing that and one of
the things sold units and did,

449
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,933
which was one of the things,
one of the things that made that book 

450
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,390
arguably the greatest work of nonfiction
in the 20th century,

451
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,613
it's in the top 10 anyways,
was to point out very clearly that the 

452
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,740
excesses of the Russian revolution 
started right away.

453
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,060
It wasn't that Lennon was a pretty good 
guy and then Stellan came in,

454
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,380
corrupted everything.
It was like Lennon was not a pretty good

455
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:54,214
guy.
The revolution got bloody really fast 

456
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,140
and what seemed to happen,
so imagine you,

457
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,073
you're.
You're starting to divide the world up 

458
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:02,080
into oppressor and oppressed,
right?

459
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,060
And you're going to do something about 
the oppressors.

460
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,930
The problem is is that you can define 
people multiple ways.

461
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,913
This is the intersectionality problem 
and almost everybody can be defined in 

462
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:16,330
terms of their group identity in some 
way that makes them an oppressor.

463
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,613
So like if you're a black man,
well you could argue that you're 

464
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:20,914
oppressed because you're black,
but what about the fact that you're a 

465
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:27,340
man and so does that make you an 
oppressor or someone who's oppressed?

466
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,250
And the answer is,
as the revolution progresses,

467
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,270
if there's any dimension along which you
can be categorized as an oppressor,

468
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,253
you end up dead.
And so that's part of the pathology of 

469
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,910
the equality of you or that you ended 
up.

470
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:40,744
Did you end up rounded up?
You ended up being put into the 

471
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:44,350
oppressor camp,
right?

472
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,010
So there's only so far you can

473
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,661
go with that,
right?

474
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:47,494
I mean,
you can't put all men in the oppressor 

475
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,850
camp.
There'll be no men left.

476
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:50,684
Like what do you all that.
But that is really sort of plays out 

477
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,830
well,
it is how it plays out.

478
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:55,664
When we look for equality of outcome,
it is how it played out in the Soviet 

479
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,541
Union.
And China,

480
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,470
I mean in the Soviet Union,
we don't know how many people died.

481
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,320
The reasonable estimates look like about
$25 million.

482
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,030
That's dad.
That's not just,

483
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,490
that's not in prison,
that isn't families destroyed,

484
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,670
that's just dead.
And in in Mao's China,

485
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,050
it might have approximated $100 million.
That's just internal repression.

486
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,003
And so what seems to happen as soon as 
you decide that the hierarchy is unfair 

487
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,460
because there are oppressors and the 
oppressed,

488
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,510
then you can go after the oppressors 
with moral virtue.

489
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,373
But the problem is is that there's 
almost no limit to the number of ways 

490
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:35,720
that you can categorize someone as an 
oppressor.

491
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,183
The category just starts to expand.
Like the communists killed all the 

492
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:42,920
socialists.
It killed all the religious people.

493
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,083
They killed most of the students.
They killed all the productive farmers 

494
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,920
and they killed the productive farmers 
because they owned land,

495
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,040
you know,
and maybe little house and a few cows.

496
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,840
To be a successful farmer in Russia at 
that,

497
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,440
at the turn of the 20th century didn't 
mean you were rich.

498
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:59,090
Right?
It just meant you weren't starving.

499
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,333
It's like they killed all those people 
because they were oppressors because 

500
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,134
they had more than someone else.
That's how they defined it in order to 

501
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,280
get the people to rally against it.
Yes,

502
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,480
yes,
yes.

503
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,760
And the.
And the definition kept slipping because

504
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:11,361
we'll look,
look,

505
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:12,590
even now it's like,
well,

506
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:14,660
let's say we rally against the one 
percent,

507
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,311
you know,
and,

508
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:17,030
and those will be the money owners,
let's say.

509
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,841
It's like,
okay,

510
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:20,180
who's in that group?
Well,

511
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,750
everybody in North America is in that 
group worldwide.

512
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:24,584
Yeah.
Well,

513
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,770
but who sends the parameters,
right?

514
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,420
It's 34.
It's $34,000

515
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:32,420
a year sets you in the one percent 
worldwide,

516
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,111
right?
Right.

517
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:33,944
So,
so does that make all of us will pay 

518
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,570
basically everybody who lives above 
poverty in America in the one percent of

519
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,320
the world.
Right?

520
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,210
Right.
And also by historical standards.

521
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,090
And so the problem is,
the problem with the oppressor,

522
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:44,924
we'll press narrative,
is that you can multiply the oppressors 

523
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:49,630
endlessly and there's no end to going 
after the.

524
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,830
As soon as you make a definition,
you can move the boundaries and then the

525
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:57,290
next person is the oppressor.
And then keep going.

526
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,153
Well,
and you also see the interesting thing 

527
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:00,104
too is that this is complicated,
so I've been thinking about this 

528
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:08,480
proclivity of the left to to destroy 
members of the moderate left.

529
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,673
It's like there's the game part of the 
game is being played as far as I can 

530
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,720
tell,
the ideologically pathological game is,

531
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,740
I'm more virtuous than you.
Now look,

532
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,920
if you're on the on the radical left and
you say,

533
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:22,754
well,
you're more virtuous than a right 

534
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,081
winger.
It's like,

535
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:24,914
well,
who cares that it's obvious because the 

536
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:27,130
right wingers are are,
are,

537
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,710
are pathological,
so being more virtuous than them,

538
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,723
that's not much of an attainment,
but if I have my moderate leftist 

539
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,120
compatriot standing right beside me and 
he's pretty damn virtuous,

540
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:41,570
but I'm even more virtuous than him,
then that's a real.

541
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,553
That's a real attainment on my park.
It's a moral attainment with no effort 

542
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:46,824
on my part.
If I can figure out some way of 

543
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,044
classifying that previously virtuous 
person as an oppressor along some 

544
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:55,350
dimension,
then all of a sudden I get an increment,

545
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,184
my moral virtue and that happened all 
the time in these leftist revolutions 

546
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,070
run a muck.
That was just a constant feature,

547
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,890
so it's not good.
It's not good.

548
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,403
Why is it.
This is something that's always puzzled 

549
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:13,380
me.
Why is it that the left is defined by.

550
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,214
There's like certain.
There's certain values and one of them 

551
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,280
is when you look at the right you,
you automatically think of racism,

552
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:26,790
potential racism,
at least a dislike for gay people.

553
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:30,750
Homophobia.
There there's certain qualities that are

554
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:31,584
always attributed to conservatives and 
then there's certain qualities are that 

555
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,963
these are social things and that I'm not
quite sure I understand like why is it 

556
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:44,060
that the left is always associated in 
support of gay rights?

557
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,750
The left is always associated in support
of,

558
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,570
uh,
of all races and all genders.

559
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,440
I think it's the dispossessed issue 
again.

560
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:54,640
So imagine,
okay,

561
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:55,474
imagine that we make these hierarchies 
and there hierarchies that are devoted 

562
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:02,024
towards the goal and that the sum total 
of all those hierarchies is something 

563
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:08,890
like the patriarchy,
even though I hate that word and use it,

564
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,130
I don't like that word at all,
but,

565
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,993
but,
but that's where we're speaking within 

566
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:14,900
the confines of that theory that's 
defined in how you're using it.

567
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,610
What do you mean by the Patriarch?
Well,

568
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,180
the Patriarchy is,
is,

569
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,720
is the sum total of all Western 
hierarchy.

570
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:21,554
So let's say it's or it's the left,
the radical leftist vision of the sum 

571
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:27,470
total of all Western hierarchy.
It's always male.

572
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,160
Well that's the theory is that it's male
dominated and you know,

573
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,930
what is Patriarchy as well?
And it's a funny thing because of course

574
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:36,764
there's lots of elements.
There's lots of sub elements of the 

575
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:40,100
patriarchy that aren't male dominated.

576
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,080
So Pr,
healthcare for example,

577
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,720
universities,
the education system in general.

578
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,793
There's lots of places where these,
these sub elements are female dominated 

579
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,960
but so defined as the patriarchy and to 
define healthcare.

580
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,490
Oh,
that's a good question Joe.

581
00:28:55,491 --> 00:28:57,280
I don't know what happens if,
if,

582
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,530
if you have a sub element of the 
patriarchy,

583
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:02,930
it's dominated by women.
Is that still the patriarchy?

584
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,320
It's like the structure is still intact.
It's still performing the same function.

585
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,960
Well now the women are running it.
Was that the patriarchy?

586
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,550
And the answer to that is,
well,

587
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:12,500
we're all vague about what the 
definition is,

588
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,310
so we don't need to address that issue.
Here's the answers.

589
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,520
Here's some clear ones,
right?

590
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,300
Like a major corporations,
the vast majority of ceos are male.

591
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,223
Yeah.
We think of that as part of the 

592
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:25,010
patriarchy.
Government never been a male.

593
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,460
Men never been a female president of 
vast majority of senators,

594
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:29,750
congressmen,
etc.

595
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,740
Mail.
Yeah,

596
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:31,940
so I guess we could say,
well,

597
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:32,774
the patriarchy is all those eleMents of 
hierarchical structure that are still 

598
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:37,520
dominated by men,
law enforcement,

599
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:39,800
military mail,
mostly male,

600
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,610
right?
But it's a.

601
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,860
It's a peculiar definition because it 
means You have to.

602
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,220
You have to a fraction,
hate the patriarchy into pieces.

603
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,083
You can't you,
you can no longer talk about it as 

604
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:51,304
uniform structure.
If you're going to take out all those 

605
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:54,310
pieces that are dominated by women say,
well,

606
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:55,144
that's not the patriarchy,
but the thing is is that the whole 

607
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:00,820
concept is so we'll define that.
It's that it guards description,

608
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,110
but so is you howard though,
right?

609
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,480
I mean that's the other thing.
That's the claim.

610
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:07,570
The other claim is that all hierarchies 
are predicated on power,

611
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:09,670
which is a claim that's absolutely 
appalling.

612
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:13,180
It's like plumbers,
they part of the higher curry hierarchy.

613
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,510
You've got roaming bands of armed 
aggressive,

614
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,970
tyrannical plumber's coming to your door
saying,

615
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,630
use our service or else if that's not 
how it works.

616
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,090
You go look when you're going looking 
for a plumber,

617
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,540
you go look for a massage therapist.
You look or a surgeon for that matter,

618
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,703
or a lawyer,
you go look for the person who's most 

619
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:32,314
competent and one of the things the left
can't tolerate is the idea that 

620
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,340
hierarchies are predicated in part,
even on competence,

621
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,203
which they clearly are.
The best predictors for success in 

622
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,700
western hierarchies are intelligence and
conscientiousness.

623
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,610
Those are the best psychological 
predictors of success.

624
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,270
They only account for about a third of 
the variation in success.

625
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,313
maybe a third is probably about right,
so there's still lots of room for 

626
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,860
randomness and and even for systemic 
discrimination,

627
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,210
but the notion that our,
our systems aren't predicated in part on

628
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:05,950
competence is clearly wrong.

629
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,260
Now you asked a question about the left 
is like,

630
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,123
well,
why are the left always on the side of 

631
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,130
the people who don't fit in,
let's say,

632
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:12,964
or don't fit so easily at it,
and I think that is a matter of the 

633
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:16,264
consequences of hierarchical structures 
is that so imagine in every hierarchy 

634
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:22,750
there's some people who don't do very 
well in any given hierarchy.

635
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,093
Then imagine this,
then imagine across all the hierarchies 

636
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,180
that there's this subset of people who 
are very likely to not do well in any of

637
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,350
them.
So you might say,

638
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:33,184
well,
they're systemically discriminated 

639
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:35,074
against.
The left would be on their side because 

640
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,624
they're on the site.
Even temperamentally of the people who 

641
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,054
are dispossessed.
And the thing about that is that it's 

642
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,600
valid.
Look,

643
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,613
we need a.
We need a spokesperson politically for 

644
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:52,060
the dispossessed.
That's what the democratic party used to

645
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:53,920
do when they work for the working class.

646
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,320
The working class needed to political 
voice.

647
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:56,921
It's like,
okay,

648
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:57,910
that's the democrats.
Well,

649
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,740
why do they need a political voice?
Well to,

650
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,693
to,
to keep the hierarchy from degenerating 

651
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:06,190
into rigid tyranny.
It's part of the political discussion,

652
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,220
but now the problem is is this is the 
problem with the left is that,

653
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,220
well,
what's the hierarchy?

654
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,170
It's a tyrannical patriarchy.
It's like,

655
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,070
no,
it's not.

656
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,653
It's partly corrupt like every system,
but it's less corrupt than most systems 

657
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:24,550
and there's a lot of elements of it that
are devoted towards self improvement and

658
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,384
self monitoring.
You have to be a little nuanced and 

659
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:27,844
subtle about these sorts of things and 
you can't throw the baby out with the 

660
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:34,270
bathwater and the leftist rhetoric has 
got so intense that the.

661
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,490
The idea is,
and people believe this,

662
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:37,324
well,
the world is going to hell in hand 

663
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:38,714
basket.
Everything is getting worse in all 

664
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,334
possible ways and there's systemic 
racism everywhere and it's utterly 

665
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,720
unfair and it should be torn down and 
rebuilt.

666
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,010
so like,
no,

667
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,143
it's actually functioning unbelievably 
well even though it still has its 

668
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,160
problems,
you know,

669
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:52,994
and there's a big difference between 
saying there's systemic racism 

670
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,983
everywhere and the reason that there 
isn't perfectly equal outcomes is 

671
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,780
because of prejudice and saying,
no,

672
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:02,301
no,
look,

673
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:05,780
the system is functioning now are let's 
say at 75 percent.

674
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,763
It's doing all right.
It's got some problems including 

675
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:12,740
systemic prejudice which hopefully will 
work themselves out across time and,

676
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,873
and which show every bit of evidence of 
doing so and so we don't need a radical 

677
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:19,610
solution.
You know?

678
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,740
And,
and one of the things I've started to do

679
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:22,574
with my twitter account is to tweet out 
good non naive news Because one of the 

680
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:28,574
things that's happening in the world and
there's been half a dozen books on this 

681
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,753
or more written in the last five years 
by credible people is that the 

682
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:40,040
distribution of the idea of individual 
sovereignty and property rights and free

683
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:40,874
market economies,
etc out into the rest of the world is 

684
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:47,690
making the non westworld is making the 
non western world rich really,

685
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,220
really,
really fast.

686
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,773
So between 2000 and 2012,
the rate of absolute poverty in the 

687
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,080
world fell by half,
half.

688
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,320
It was the fastest period of economic 
development in human history.

689
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,333
We beat the un,
we beat the optimistic un target by 

690
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:06,380
three years.
Staggering.

691
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,910
Um,
you know,

692
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:08,744
the,
the rates of child mortality in africa 

693
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,570
are now lower than they were in europe 
in 1950.

694
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,680
The fastest growing economies in the 
world are in subsaharan africa.

695
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,023
Many millions of people,
millions of people a month are getting 

696
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:27,240
access to this incredible technology 
that's embodied in cell phones,

697
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,633
right?
People have access to fresh water like 

698
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:32,030
they've never had access before.
The child,

699
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,083
uh,
the kids are kids are getting immunized 

700
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:37,470
at a rate that's,
that's unfair,

701
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,020
that's unprecedented.
And,

702
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,490
and yet we have this idea that's become 
rampant in the west,

703
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:45,324
that there's something ultimately 
corrupt about the patriarchal tyranny 

704
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:51,090
and that it has to be dismantled right 
down to its core.

705
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,900
And a lot of that's being taught by the 
activist disciplines in universities.

706
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:57,300
And I just don't get it.
It's not acceptable.

707
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,493
So they see these hierarchies and their 
proposal to level everything off and to 

708
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:10,140
take away the insane power at the very 
top is equality of outcome,

709
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,890
is unproven,
unproven in terms of it's never been.

710
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,210
It's never been done successfully to a 
utopian right,

711
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:18,240
right.

712
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,073
Well,
and I also don't even think you can do 

713
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:21,174
it in principle because if you accept 
the proposition that the propositions I 

714
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:25,394
laid out,
which is you have to pursue things of 

715
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:30,330
value and if you pursue things in a 
value in,

716
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,583
in a social space,
so you do it cooperatively and 

717
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:34,560
competitively,
you do it with other people,

718
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,723
then you're going to produce 
differential outcome because people be 

719
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,070
differently.

720
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,480
Good at it.
It was like,

721
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:40,590
okaY,
you don't believe that.

722
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,603
It's like,
okay,

723
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,623
do you listen to random selections of 
music online or do you do what everyone 

724
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:47,424
else does?
You go for the one 10th of one percent 

725
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:51,570
of songwriters and you only listen to 
them.

726
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,823
You only listen to the one.
You only read the productions of one 

727
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,184
10th of one percent of writers.
You only listen to the podcasts of one 

728
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,790
10th of one percent of podcasts.
Broadcasters,

729
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,103
right when you watch sports on tv,
you only watch the athletic 

730
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,990
contributions of one 10th of one percent
of athletes,

731
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,630
so like where's the equality?
Exactly.

732
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,703
Where's that in your life?
You people who are pushing for equality 

733
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:18,710
of outcome.
You manifest that in anything you do,

734
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,173
you don't.
You're unbelievably selective just like 

735
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:25,690
everyone else and the reason you're 
selective is because you.

736
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,673
There are things that are happening that
need to happen or that are entertaining 

737
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:33,530
and interesting and you want the best in
all of those realms.

738
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,910
That's how it works and there is a best.
That's the other thing that's so painful

739
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,330
and that that actually is painful.
You know what?

740
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,780
Here's a problem of dispossession.
A real problem.

741
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,113
One waY to not do very well in any 
hierarchy is to have a low iq and so iq 

742
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:58,330
is normally distributed and if you have 
an iq of less than 85,

743
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,390
it's hard for you to read well enough to
follow instructions.

744
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,973
That's about 10 percent of the 
population might even be higher than 

745
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,060
that.
Okay,

746
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:08,790
so given that lack,
how are you going to compete?

747
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Announcer is you're not because low iq 
is a good predictor of poverty.

748
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,500
Now these spiral,
because if you're,

749
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,060
if you,
if you're cognitively,

750
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,430
if you're on in the,
if you're,

751
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,990
if you're less cognitively gifted then 
and you have children,

752
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:27,640
they're going to be in a less enriched 
environment.

753
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,473
These things spiral,
but you still have the essential 

754
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:30,994
problem.
that's the essential problem of the 

755
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:32,914
dispossessed.
It's like hierarchies are complex tools 

756
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:38,770
to obtain necessary goals,
but they dispossessed people.

757
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,170
What do we do with the people that they 
dispossessed?

758
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,093
The answer is we don't know,
so we have to talk about it constantly 

759
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:46,964
to figure out how to solve it because 
it's an ongoing problem that transforms 

760
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:50,174
and that's the reason that political 
dialogue is necessary and then the 

761
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:56,120
danger is is that the political dialogue
will polarize into the radical left,

762
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,270
no hierarchies whatsoever,
or the radical right?

763
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,890
Our hierarchy is 100 percent right at 
all costs and so those are the.

764
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,293
We have the eternal problem and those 
are the two poles that we have to 

765
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:07,940
negotIate between.

766
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,503
It's interesting because the accusation 
has always been that what the left is 

767
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:13,854
trying to do with this equality of 
outcome thing is sort of an infant's 

768
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,310
stylization of the populous.
right?

769
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,310
And the best example of that,
a sports,

770
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,530
um,
when you look at sports,

771
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:29,550
clearly the best people when the fastest
runners,

772
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:30,384
when the race,
the people that have the best strategy 

773
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:35,710
when the game,
the infant infant,

774
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:36,160
that's a weird

775
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,680
word in fun.
Thailand and I never get it right,

776
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:43,681
but of that is what we do with children 
where you get participation trophies and

777
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:47,110
no one wins.
When my daughter was three years old,

778
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:50,050
she was in soccer and they didn't keep 
score,

779
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,440
but everyone knew.
Everyone knew these kids scored and they

780
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,340
didn't.
At the end of the game,

781
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:55,740
they didn't announce a winner.
There was no,

782
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,270
you can't have a soccer game without 
keeping score.

783
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,970
You're not a soccer game anymore.
It's something else.

784
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,770
But the score was kept.
Of course,

785
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:05,560
it just wasn't discussed was of course 
it was the strangest thing,

786
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,430
but this is to treat these little kids 
because they couldn't handle it.

787
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,860
she cried when the other team scored.
I'm like,

788
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:16,861
that's it feels bad when they score,
so it feels good when you score.

789
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,240
It's very difficult to say that to a 
three year old.

790
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,660
Right,
so I'm going to run hills.

791
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,613
Is she going to practice drills so that 
she feels that good feeling more and 

792
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:28,900
then there's a point where that becomes 
too far.

793
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,930
There's a point where you become an 
obsessive over winter,

794
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,973
right?
And this is the people that want to 

795
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:35,770
crush their enemies.
Then you become conan the barbarian.

796
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,551
Yeah,
this is.

797
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:40,060
This is the far end of it and this is 
what the left is terrified up,

798
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,953
right?
Yeah.

799
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,470
The idea of the left is the demure,
the soft,

800
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,290
the,
the,

801
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,770
the,
the people that are kinder and gentler.

802
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,120
The idea of the right is the conqueror.
The people that work hard,

803
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,040
play hard,
go kick ass,

804
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,390
go America,
that kind of shit.

805
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,270
And so these are the type of people that
are going to be crueler.

806
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,253
They're going to do what it takes to win
and the people that you would consider 

807
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,753
that would like equality of outcome or 
the people that are trying to slow that 

808
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:08,134
down.

809
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,700
Does this make sense?
yes,

810
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,623
absolutely,
and I think that's how it lays itself 

811
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:12,400
out.
Temperamentally,

812
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,220
psychologically,
this is the motivation for all this.

813
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,103
Yes,
yes,

814
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,953
yes.
And it's.

815
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,200
And the radical left is his compassion 
going mad,

816
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,520
although it's also envy.
Let's not forget about that as well.

817
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,430
Absolutely.
I mean,

818
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,653
one reason to stand up for the 
dispossessed is because you're 

819
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,960
empathetic and empathy is not an 
automatic good.

820
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,790
This is something we make a big mistake 
about.

821
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,653
We think,
well,

822
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm feeling sorry for you,
therefore I'm good.

823
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,351
It's like,
no,

824
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:42,100
I might be feeling too sorry for you.
I might not be demanding enough of you.

825
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,533
So.
And that's the terrible devouring 

826
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:44,891
mother,
you know,

827
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,550
from a psychoanalytic perspective,
everything you do dear is okay.

828
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,061
It's like,
no,

829
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:50,780
it's not right.
So.

830
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,460
So one of the things that john piaget,
the developmental psychologist,

831
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:55,294
he was very interested in figuring out a
way out of this and it's very much 

832
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,490
relevant to your concept you're talking 
about about athletics.

833
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,471
Okay.
So,

834
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:02,304
so imagine this because this is also 
something that points the way to a 

835
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,124
proper morality,
which was actually something that john 

836
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:09,460
piaget was very concerned about.
he wanted to.

837
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,850
he wanted to reconcile that distinction 
between religion and science.

838
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,100
That's actually what drove him,
even though he was.

839
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,413
people don't know that he was arguably 
the world's greatest developmental 

840
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:19,900
psychologist.
so.

841
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,730
So here's the idea.
You know,

842
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:24,400
how you tell your kid to be a good 
sport.

843
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,503
You say don't.
It doesn't matter whether you win and 

844
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,820
lose,
it matters how you play the game.

845
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,283
Okay?
So I've been unpacking that in my 

846
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:32,260
lectures because it's really,
really complicated.

847
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,070
It's like you tell your kid that and

848
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,800
they look at you and they think,
well,

849
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:39,320
what do you mean by that?
Aren't I supposed to try to win?

850
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,880
It's a soccer game.
I'm trying to.

851
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,590
I'm supposed to win.
And you say,

852
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,730
well yeah,
you're supposed to win,

853
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,620
but it doesn't matter whether you win or
lose.

854
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:48,170
It matters how you play the game.
You know that that's right.

855
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,790
But you don't know how to explain it to 
your kit.

856
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:50,991
You say,
well,

857
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,760
you want to be a good sport.
Okay,

858
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:53,594
so imagine this.
This is how it works and this is 

859
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:58,190
crucially important.
So first of all,

860
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,730
life is not a game.
Even a game is not a game because a game

861
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:08,780
is most of the time the game is the 
beginning of a series of games.

862
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,210
So let's say that you're on a soccer 
team.

863
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,140
Well there's wInning the game,
but the game isn't the issue.

864
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,973
the game is the whole series of game.
So maybe the game is winning the 

865
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:21,320
championship and winning the 
championship and winning ad game are not

866
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:23,630
the same thing.
And the reason for that is,

867
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,320
well maybe if you want to win a game,
the best thing to do is to let your star

868
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:30,650
player make all the moves.
But if you want to win a championship,

869
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:31,484
maybe the best thing is for your star 
player to do everything he or she 

870
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:35,900
possibly can to develop all the other 
team members.

871
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,333
That's a different strategy and the 
reason it's different is because it 

872
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,000
iterates across time.
Okay,

873
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:44,210
so I'll tell you a quick story.
So when my kid was playing hockey,

874
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,740
when,
when he was about 12 or so,

875
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,710
he was in the championship game just at 
a local arena,

876
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:49,990
you know,
and uh,

877
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,500
it was really fun to watch.

878
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,800
The teams were pretty equal,
which is something that you want so that

879
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:55,634
everybody can expand their skills while 
they're playing and it was like five 

880
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:00,914
seconds to,
to the end of the game and the other 

881
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:03,284
team made a breakaway and came down and 
the guy came down nice and scored a 

882
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,120
beautiful goal and it was for three and 
that was the end of it,

883
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,983
right?
And all my kids team there is the kid 

884
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:12,110
who is the star and he was a pretty good
hockey player.

885
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,640
He came off the ice and he was very 
annoyed about wHat had happened.

886
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,780
He smashed his stick on the cement and 
was complaining about the refereeing and

887
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,643
acting as if he'd been robbed.
And his father came up and instead of 

888
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:25,850
saying,
get your act together,

889
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:26,684
kid,
that's no way to display yourself after 

890
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,150
a loss.
He said,

891
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,850
oh yeah man,
you were robbed that the referees didn't

892
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:32,400
ref right.

893
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,820
And you played the best and you should 
have one,

894
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,730
and I thought you had absolute son of a 
bitch.

895
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,660
You're ruining your son.
And then the question is why?

896
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,910
Because hIs son was the star and was 
trying to win.

897
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,920
Why was he running his son?
Well,

898
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,710
you're trying to train your son not to 
win the game.

899
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,420
You're trying to train your son to win 
the championship.

900
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,500
And so that's a series of games,
but then life isn't the championship.

901
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,700
Life is a whole bunch of championships.
It's a whole sequence of them.

902
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,073
And so what you're actually trying to 
train your son to do is to be a 

903
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:06,404
contender in the entire series.
And the way you do that is by helping 

904
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:11,054
him develop his character and the 
character is actually the strategy that 

905
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:15,224
would enable him to win the largest 
number of games across the largest 

906
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,760
possible span of time.

907
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,160
And one way you do That if you're a kid 
is like,

908
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:23,510
well,
what do you want to do with your kid?

909
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,913
You don't want to teach him to when you 
want to teach him to play well with 

910
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:29,750
others.
And that's to be reciprocal.

911
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,810
So that means to try to win,
but also to pay attention to the,

912
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,713
to to developing the other people around
him and not to put winning the game 

913
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:38,364
above everything at all times.
So Then he's fun to play with and this 

914
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:43,710
is absolutely crucial.
You get you can.

915
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,730
You can help your kid become fun to play
with between the ages of two and the age

916
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:50,520
of four.
If your kid is fun to play with,

917
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:55,110
then what happens?
Kids line up to play with him and adults

918
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:58,520
lined up to teach him and if kids line 
up to play with him,

919
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,443
then he'll have friends his whole life 
and he'll be socialized and can be 

920
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:03,530
invited to many games,
some of which he'll win.

921
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,630
All of which will be able to participate
in.

922
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,360
And if he's fun to play within,
adults will teach him things.

923
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,630
and then he wins at life.
And so when you say to your kid,

924
00:45:11,631 --> 00:45:14,510
it doesn't matter whether you win or 
lose matters how you play the game.

925
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,320
What you're saying is don't forget kid 
that what you're trying to do here is to

926
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:19,154
do well at life and you need to practice
the strategies that enable you to do 

927
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:23,984
well at life while you're in any 
specific game and you never want to 

928
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:27,794
compromise your ability to do well at 
life for the sake of winning a single 

929
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:31,604
game,
and there's a deep ethic in that and 

930
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:33,904
it's the ethic of reciprocity in games.
Part of the reason that we're so 

931
00:45:38,091 --> 00:45:42,330
obsessed with sports is because we like 
to see that dramatized.

932
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:43,164
You know,
like the person we really admire as an 

933
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:48,930
athlete isn't only the person who wins.
We don't like the narcissistic winners.

934
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:51,540
They're winners and that's a plus,
but if they're narcissistic,

935
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,493
they're not good team players.
they're only out for themselves than we 

936
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:56,064
think.
Well,

937
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,280
you're a winner in the narrow sense,
but your character is suspect.

938
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,620
You're no role model even though you're 
a winner,

939
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,990
and it's because we're looking for 
something deeper.

940
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,393
We're looking for that.
The manifestation of character that 

941
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:10,230
allows you to win across the set of 
possible games,

942
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,510
and that's a real thing.
That's a real ethic.

943
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,250
It's a fundamental ethic.

944
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,040
I think what you're pointing out that's 
very important is we're,

945
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,130
we're searching for the person who's got
it all nailed.

946
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,263
Someone who tries their hardest but is 
also honest enough about the 

947
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:31,731
circumstances to not cry foul when it's 
gone the other person's way yet.

948
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:33,640
Well,
that's part of resIlience.

949
00:46:33,641 --> 00:46:35,280
It's right.
You're not gonna win it.

950
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,010
You're not going to.
You're not going to score on every shot.

951
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,143
Right?
Doesn't mean you shouldn't take the 

952
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:41,940
shots.
Doesn't mean you shouldn't try to to hit

953
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:42,774
the goal,
but part of part of being able to 

954
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:45,414
continue to take shots is to have the 
strength of character to tolerate the 

955
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:52,080
fact that that in that instance you 
weren't on top.

956
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,033
It's more trivial in games than it is in
fights and it's also the response is 

957
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:03,551
much more negative to the from the fans.
If you lose a fight and complained about

958
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,180
it,
it is.

959
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,320
It's ruthless because they understand 
that you've made a huge character error.

960
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,033
Yeah.
So why do you think it's more important 

961
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:13,843
in fights than it is in games?
Why do you think it's because the 

962
00:47:15,801 --> 00:47:16,634
consequences are so grave?
Because you recognize that the high is 

963
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:21,950
much higher and the lows are much lower 
to lose.

964
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:24,950
A basketball game sucks,
but it's nothing like losing a fight.

965
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:26,810
There's no comparison.
It's not even close.

966
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,600
What do you think

967
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,620
it is?
The damages the fighter.

968
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,420
If he complains about losing,
why is that a mistake?

969
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:36,730
Why did the fans respond negatively to 
that?

970
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,610
Because they know they know that you 
lost.

971
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,520
They know that you're complaining for no
reason and you're not a hero.

972
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,563
They want you to be better than them.
They want you to be the person that has 

973
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,470
the courage to step into a cage or a 
ring or wherever,

974
00:47:48,471 --> 00:47:49,304
wherever you were,
whatever the format is you're competing 

975
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,100
and to do something that's extremely 
difficult and when you do that,

976
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:56,560
they hold you to a higher standard to 
lose with grace.

977
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:57,610
yes,
and when you fall,

978
00:47:57,611 --> 00:47:58,444
especially if you were a champion,
that is one of the most disappointing 

979
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,990
things ever want to champion complains 
and it.

980
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,700
His response is horrific from the 
audience.

981
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,050
Okay,
so that's a great example.

982
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,890
So let's imagine,
what does the person who loses something

983
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,000
important with grace?

984
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,680
Do announcers fairlY straightforward.
He accepts the defeat and thinks,

985
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:18,820
okay,
what?

986
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:19,983
What is it that I have left to improve 
that will decrease the possibility of a 

987
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:24,850
similar defeat in the future?
Right,

988
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,693
so so,
so what he's doing is because the great 

989
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:28,864
athlete and the great person is not only
someone who's exceptionally skilled at 

990
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:33,214
what they do,
but who's trying to expand their skills 

991
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,270
at all at all times.
Yes,

992
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,660
and the attempt to expand their skills 
at all times is even more important than

993
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:41,494
the fact that they're great to begin 
with because the trajectory is so 

994
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,014
important,
more important in particular to the 

995
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:48,040
audience.
It's extremely important to the audience

996
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,140
because you are the person who's 
competing.

997
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,333
You are expecting them to live out this 
life in a perfect way or in a much more 

998
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:58,510
powerful way than you're capable of,
and so part of that is the skill because

999
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:01,870
they put it into practice,
but part of that also is the willingness

1000
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:05,530
to push the skill farther into new 
domains of development with each action,

1001
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,450
and that's really what people like to 
watch,

1002
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:07,630
right?

1003
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,270
They don't like to watch a perfect 
athletic performance.

1004
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,463
They like to watch a perfect athletic 
performance that's pushed into the 

1005
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:17,020
domain of new risk.
They want to see both at the same time.

1006
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,240
You're really good at what you do and 
you're getting better.

1007
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,343
Okay,
so you lose a match which is not any 

1008
00:49:22,091 --> 00:49:23,860
indication that you're not good at what 
you do.

1009
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,900
You might not be as good as the person 
who beat you,

1010
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,033
but if you lose the match and then wine,
what you've done is sacrificed the 

1011
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:32,080
higher order principle of constant 
improvement,

1012
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:35,530
of your own skills because you should be
analyzing the loss and saying,

1013
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,603
I'm the reason I lost in so far as it's 
relevant to this particular time and 

1014
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:42,064
place is the insufficiencies I 
manifested that defeated me and I need 

1015
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:48,490
to track those insufficiency so that I 
can rectify them in the future.

1016
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,593
And if I'm blaming it on you or the 
referees or the situation that I'm not 

1017
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:55,360
taking responsibility and I'm not 
pushing myself forward.

1018
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,790
And so then you also take the meaning 
out of it.

1019
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,070
but one of the things I've been doing on
my tour,

1020
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,653
people are criticizing me to some degree
for saying things to people that are 

1021
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:05,590
obvious.
Well,

1022
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:07,390
first of all,
it's not like I didn't bloody well no,

1023
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:09,880
they were obvious when I wrote those 
things.

1024
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,130
You want my rules in my book.
For example,

1025
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:13,990
stand up straight with your shoulders 
back.

1026
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:14,824
You know,
treat yourself like you're someone 

1027
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:16,354
responsible for helping.
It's like I know perfectly well that 

1028
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:22,900
those can be read as cliches.
The question is cliche,

1029
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:26,080
let's say is something that's so true 
that it's that it's become

1030
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,260
that it's become widely accepted by 
everyone.

1031
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,020
Well,
but we don't know why it's true anymore.

1032
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,080
And so this,
this issue,

1033
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,350
the issue that we're talking about here 
are the issue of being a good sport.

1034
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:40,184
We need to figure out why that's true.
And the reason that it's true is that 

1035
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,640
you're trying to push your development 
farther than you've already developed at

1036
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:48,590
every point in time.
And that's the proper.

1037
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,440
That's the proper moral attitude.
So

1038
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,503
when you see an athletic performance 
where someone is pushing themselves 

1039
00:50:59,881 --> 00:51:00,714
beyond what they are,
you see someone dramatizing the process 

1040
00:51:03,031 --> 00:51:05,700
of proper adaptation.
It isn't the skill itself,

1041
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:06,534
it's the extension of the skill and when
you see someone acting like a bad sport 

1042
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:10,064
and they're sacrificing that and so 
they're sacrificing the higher for the 

1043
00:51:12,211 --> 00:51:14,670
lower and no one likes that in the 
fights.

1044
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,580
It's got to be.
See the question is,

1045
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:18,414
that's the thing I can't quite figure 
out is why that would be even 

1046
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:20,814
exaggerated in a fight situation.
And then you said it's because the 

1047
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:24,360
stakes are so high.

1048
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,283
Yeah.
The consequences of victory or defeat 

1049
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,190
there.
There's just so much greater.

1050
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,250
There's your.
Your health is on the lot.

1051
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:36,960
it's one of the rare things that you do 
where your health is on the line,

1052
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:37,890
your physical health,

1053
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:38,863
right?
So the more extreme victories and more 

1054
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:40,964
extreme defeats,
the morality that's associated with 

1055
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:44,630
defeat is more extreme.
Exactly.

1056
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:45,470
Because there's more on the line.

1057
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,141
Yeah,
exactly.

1058
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:50,300
Makes sense.
And the way people treat the champions,

1059
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,213
it's a very different thing.
It's the respect and adulation that a 

1060
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:56,264
champion receives is it's the pinnacle 
of sports in terms of the love from the 

1061
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:04,850
audience.
when someone wins a great fight,

1062
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,253
it's.
There's nothing like it and this is one 

1063
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:08,174
of the reasons why these people are 
willing to put their health on the line 

1064
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,380
because that high,
the high of victory,

1065
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,720
and it's not just a victory.
It's a.

1066
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,440
Who was it who said victory is really 
the victory over the lesser you.

1067
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,460
It's a victory over as the victim.
Yes.

1068
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,760
Yeah.
It's the victory is over you.

1069
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,653
You've got to realize a guy like steve 
bay chick who defends his heavyweight 

1070
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:36,730
title this weekend in the ufc.
He is,

1071
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,870
he's the heavYweight champion of the 
world,

1072
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:41,870
but he's not undefeated.
He lost in his career.

1073
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,220
He's lost a couple of times and he was,
I'm sure he's lost wrestling matches and

1074
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:51,290
sparring sessions in the gym and he's a 
product of improvement.

1075
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,453
He's a product of discipline and hard 
work and thinking and strategy and 

1076
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,840
constantly improving upon those skills.
And so because of that,

1077
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:00,674
he's the baddest man.

1078
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,000
So my in my book,
rule four is,

1079
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,460
this is 12,
excuse me,

1080
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:11,010
this is from 12 rules for life.
Rule four is compare yourself to who you

1081
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:13,290
were yesterday,
not to who someone else's today.

1082
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,970
Yes,
because you need to be.

1083
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,550
You need to have a hierarchy of 
improvement.

1084
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:18,384
You need to be aiming for something and 
that means you're going to be lesser 

1085
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:21,534
than people who've always already 
attained along that dimension and that 

1086
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,980
can give rise to.
So

1087
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,770
the question is who should you defeat in
the final analysis?

1088
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:30,930
And the answer is you should defeat your
former self.

1089
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,003
You should be constantly trying to do 
that and you're the right control for 

1090
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,244
yourself too because you're the one 
who's had all your advantages and 

1091
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:38,274
disadvantages.
And so if you want to compete fairly 

1092
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:42,060
with someone,
then you should be competing with you.

1093
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,193
And it is the case in.
This is what we were talking about too 

1094
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:46,644
with regards to the self improvement of 
the fighter is well if you're improving 

1095
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:51,114
yourself,
then what you are doing is competing 

1096
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:54,570
with your lesser self.
And then you might also ask,

1097
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:55,404
well what is that lesser self?
And that lesser self would be resentful 

1098
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:03,591
and bitter and,
and I'm aggressive and vengeance seeking

1099
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:07,320
and all of those things that go along 
with having a negative moral character.

1100
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,154
And those are things that interfere with
your ability to progress as you move 

1101
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:11,640
forward through life.

1102
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,870
So it's very necessary to understand 
that this is why,

1103
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,213
you know,
I've been stressing this idea of 

1104
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:19,134
personal responsibility.
Personal responsibility is to compete 

1105
00:54:22,021 --> 00:54:22,854
with yourself,
is to be slightly better than yourself 

1106
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:27,450
the next day and it better in some way 
that you can actually manage.

1107
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:28,830
And that's humility.
It's right,

1108
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:29,431
like,
well,

1109
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:31,950
I'm a flawed person and I've got all my 
problems.

1110
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,330
Could I be as good as person x?
It's like not right question.

1111
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:37,164
The right question is could You be 
slightly better tomorrow than you are 

1112
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:39,984
currently flawed self?
And now answer to that is if you have 

1113
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:45,570
enough humility to set the bar properly 
low,

1114
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,840
then you could be better tomorrow than 
you are today.

1115
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,120
Because what you also have to do is you 
have to say,

1116
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:51,954
well,
here's all my flaws and my 

1117
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,014
insufficiencies and the best that 
someone that flawed and insufficient 

1118
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:00,990
could do to improve and actually do it 
is this,

1119
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,973
and that's not worth going out in the 
street and celebrating with plaque 

1120
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:04,620
cards.

1121
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,550
You know,
it's like,

1122
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,443
well,
this is why I tell people to clean the 

1123
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:07,824
room.
It's not going to brag to someone that 

1124
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:11,490
you did that,
but someone is insufficient as you might

1125
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:12,324
be able to manage it,
and that means you actually are on the 

1126
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:14,994
pathway to self improvement and you're 
transcending your former self and you 

1127
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:18,151
might say,
well,

1128
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:21,390
what's the right way of being in the 
world if there is such a thing?

1129
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,390
And it's not acting according to a set 
of rules.

1130
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,770
It's attempting continually to transcend
the flawed thing that you currently are.

1131
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,640
And what's so interesting about that is 
that the meaning and the meaning in life

1132
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,503
is to be found in that pursuit.
So I've been laying that out in these 

1133
00:55:35,911 --> 00:55:37,680
discussions too because it's say,
well,

1134
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:38,963
the.
The fundamental issue is that life is 

1135
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:41,094
tragic and difficult.
Very tragic and difficult for everyone 

1136
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,593
and it's also tainted by malevolence 
because no matter how things are tragic 

1137
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:51,714
and difficult,
but there's always some stupid thing 

1138
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:55,620
that you could do or someone else could 
do that could make it even worse than it

1139
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:56,454
has to be,
so that's life and you need an antidote 

1140
00:55:58,891 --> 00:56:02,700
to that because that can embitter you 
constant contact with that,

1141
00:56:02,701 --> 00:56:03,534
just the tragedy,
but the tragedy combined with betrayal 

1142
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:08,490
and malevolence,
that makes it even worse,

1143
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,680
especially if it's self induced.

1144
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,023
Okay,
so you need something to set against 

1145
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:14,730
that so you don't get bitter and 
resentful.

1146
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,230
Well,
what do you set against that?

1147
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,740
Doing something worthwhile by her own 
definition.

1148
00:56:19,741 --> 00:56:20,574
Say you need some reason to get the hell
out of bed on a terrible day because 

1149
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:24,860
you've got something good to do.
Well,

1150
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:25,703
what's the best thing you can do?
Transcend your current wretched and 

1151
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:29,674
miserable self.
There's meaning to be found in that and 

1152
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:32,464
real risk and that's.
That's a meaning that's associated with 

1153
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:35,434
responsibility.
One of the things that I've been trying 

1154
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:42,181
to lay out clearly is that life is hard.
It's tainted by malevolence and be trail

1155
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,120
that can make you bitter.
You need a meaning to offset that.

1156
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,470
where's the meaning to be found?
Not in rights,

1157
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,850
not an impulsive pleasure,
but in responsibility.

1158
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,090
You take responsibility for yourself so 
you take care of yourself.

1159
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,313
If you're good at it,
you can have some excess leftover to 

1160
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:00,850
take care of your damn family.
If you're good at both of those,

1161
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:03,580
then you have some excess leftover to 
take care of your community.

1162
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,593
Those are heavy burdens.
You pick up the burdens you find that's 

1163
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,800
meaningful.
the best way to pick up the burden is to

1164
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:12,310
continually improve yourself and that's 
where the meaning is to be found,

1165
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,460
and so that meaning is in the continual 
self transcendence.

1166
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,180
That's letting your old self die and the
new self be reborn.

1167
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,490
You did you watch when we were kings,
allie,

1168
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,310
allie fraiser.
God,

1169
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:25,750
that's an amazing,
amazing,

1170
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:26,584
amazing movie right at the end of it.
So lee defeats frazier basically by 

1171
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:31,330
letting him defeat himself,
right?

1172
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:32,164
Because frazier is angry and he's got a 
chip on his shoulder and he doesn't 

1173
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:37,720
conduct the fight properly,
so we exhausts himself chasing ellie and

1174
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:40,570
ellie is basically just trained himself 
to take the dam blows.

1175
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,040
Right?
And to where frazier out,

1176
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:44,380
that's his plan.
then right at the end of the movie,

1177
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:47,650
he knocks frazier down and it's pretty 
much the end of the fight,

1178
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:49,690
but frazier sort of struggled to his 
feet,

1179
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:50,524
you know,
he's just getting up off the mat and 

1180
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:52,414
alli's got his hand pulled back to just 
nail them because he's completely laid 

1181
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:58,060
open and he puts his glove down and 
turns away.

1182
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,940
That's the end of the fight.
And frazier said,

1183
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,010
and this is true,
as far as I know,

1184
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:03,844
that that fight tamed him,
like frazier had a big chip on his 

1185
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:10,300
shoulder and he was kind of a dreadful 
guy up until that fight it afterwards.

1186
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:12,310
He was affable and he was.
He was civilized,

1187
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,760
lee civilized and so,
but that,

1188
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:15,623
that gesture that allie made was that 
great gesture because he could have 

1189
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,500
flattened him.
Right.

1190
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,850
And he had every reason to.
Man.

1191
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:22,684
He got,
he got,

1192
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,070
he got taken apart,
a lead,

1193
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:24,904
took punches like mad in that fight and 
then in the final analysis when he had 

1194
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:29,680
frazier down and he was struggling to 
his feet,

1195
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,240
he just let him go,
man.

1196
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,200
Nobility of character right there.
Something impressive to behold.

1197
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,693
So

1198
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:39,703
when,
why are you defining people like when 

1199
00:58:42,741 --> 00:58:45,140
you're saying this,
why you saying you're miserable?

1200
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,003
Wretched life because there's a lot of 
people that don't have miserable 

1201
00:58:48,471 --> 00:58:50,510
wretched lives that also just want to 
improve.

1202
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:53,650
Like why does it have to be the worst 
case scenario in order to.

1203
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,370
cause it has to work,
it has to,

1204
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,070
it has to work.
The theory has to work in the worst case

1205
00:58:58,071 --> 00:58:58,980
scenario.
Okay.

1206
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,600
That's why you're using the worst case 
scenario as an.

1207
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,613
yeah.
Because do you think that that perhaps 

1208
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:04,454
may alienate someone who doesn't have 
the worst case scenario just watched 

1209
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:07,730
improvement?
No,

1210
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,563
I don't think so because.
Well it depends on how much time you 

1211
00:59:10,731 --> 00:59:13,450
have outline the ideas,
but you know what I.

1212
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,490
Because even if things are going really 
well for you now,

1213
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,970
there's going to be a time in the future
where things are rough,

1214
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:20,590
you know,
you're going to be ill,

1215
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,100
family members going to be

1216
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,320
ill,
a dream is going to fall apart,

1217
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,240
you're going to be,
you're going to be a,

1218
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,250
uh,
uncertain about your employment status,

1219
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,190
like the flood is coming,
right?

1220
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,033
The apocalypse is coming,
it's always the case in life and you 

1221
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:33,974
have to be prepared for it.
And The question is how to prepare for 

1222
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:36,674
it.
And the answer to that is to find a way 

1223
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:41,030
of being that works even under the 
diarist of circumstances.

1224
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,730
That's the issue.
And so you outline,

1225
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,813
and I mean I am pessimistic about this 
in my approach in some sense because 

1226
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:49,880
when I'm talking to my audiences in,
the same thing happens in,

1227
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,580
happened in my book maps of meaning and 
in 12 rules for life,

1228
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:56,090
I'm laying out the worst case scenario.
And that sort of like hell,

1229
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,163
it's,
things are going really badly for you 

1230
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,490
and that there's just chance associated 
with that sometimes.

1231
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,670
And you and the people around you are 
doing stupid things to make it worse.

1232
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:05,990
It's like,
okay,

1233
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,820
what have you got under those 
circumstances?

1234
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,720
You've got the possibility to slowly 
raise yourself out of the mire.

1235
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:12,703
You've got the possibility to do just 
what the fighter does when he's 

1236
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:16,070
defeated,
which is to say,

1237
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,353
well,
regardless of the circumstances that 

1238
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:20,594
might have led to my defeat,
and even if there were errors on the 

1239
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:26,390
part of the referee,
this is no time to whine about it.

1240
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,313
This is a time to take stock of what I 
did wrong so that I could improve it 

1241
01:00:30,141 --> 01:00:32,480
into the future.
And that's the right attitude.

1242
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,830
You know,
in the old testament,

1243
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:34,664
one of the things that's really 
interesting about the old testament 

1244
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:39,890
stories is in the old testament,
the jews keep getting walloped by god.

1245
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,813
It's like they,
they struggle up and make an empire and 

1246
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:46,180
then they just get walloped and then 
it's all crushed in there.

1247
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,273
They're out of it for generations,
and then they struggle back up and make 

1248
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:52,400
an empire and then they get demolished 
again.

1249
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:55,120
And it happens over and over and over.
And the,

1250
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:59,960
the attitude of the old testament 
hebrews is we must have made a mistake.

1251
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,790
It's never to shake their fist at the 
sky and curse fate.

1252
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,863
it's never that.
The presupposition is if things aren't 

1253
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:08,774
working out,
it's my fault and that's a hell of a 

1254
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,760
presupposition.
And you mighT say,

1255
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:14,760
well,
of course you know,

1256
01:01:14,761 --> 01:01:15,594
it's that,
that underestimates the degree to which 

1257
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,740
there is systemic oppression,
et cetera,

1258
01:01:20,741 --> 01:01:23,060
et cetera,
and and the and the vagaries of fate.

1259
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:25,760
It's like it doesn't over underestimate.
It's not the point.

1260
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,193
The point is,
your best strategic position is how my 

1261
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,550
insufficient and how can I rectify that?
That's what you've got.

1262
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,780
And the thing is you are insufficient 
and you could rectify it.

1263
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,080
Both of those are within your grasp.
if you aim low enough,

1264
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,990
one of the things you see the you,
that's another thing you keep saying,

1265
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,180
aim low enough,
have a low enough bar.

1266
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:48,260
Why do you,
why do you mean that?

1267
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,273
Well,
let's say you've got a kid and you want 

1268
01:01:50,031 --> 01:01:50,864
the kid to improve.
You don't set them a bar that's so high 

1269
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:54,380
that it's impossible for them to attain 
it.

1270
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,270
You take a look at the kid and you 
think,

1271
01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:58,370
okay,
this kid's got this range of skill,

1272
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,413
here's a challenge we can throw at him 
or her that exceeds their current level 

1273
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:03,824
of skill,
but gives them a reasonable probability 

1274
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:06,494
of success.
And so like I'm saying it tongue and 

1275
01:02:08,381 --> 01:02:09,710
cheek to some degree,
you know,

1276
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:10,970
it's like,
but if you're,

1277
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:13,430
but I'm doing it as an aid to humility,
it's like,

1278
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:15,800
well I don't know how to start improving
my life.

1279
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,020
someone might say that,
and I would say,

1280
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,410
well,
you're not aiming low enough.

1281
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,180
There's something you could do that you 
are regarding as trivial that,

1282
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:27,060
that,
that you could do that you would do that

1283
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:27,894
would result in an actual improvement,
but it's not a big enough improvement 

1284
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:31,854
for you.
So you won'T lower yourself enough to 

1285
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:35,370
take the opportunity.
Incremental steps.

1286
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,233
Yes.
And so this is also what is achieved 

1287
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:39,780
through exercise.
It's one of the most important.

1288
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:41,520
Yeah.
Well what do you do when you go and lift

1289
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:42,660
weights?
You don't go on,

1290
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,230
like if you have a bench press before 
you don't put 400 pounds on the damn bar

1291
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:48,600
and dropped and dropped the bar through 
your skull.

1292
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:49,763
You know,
you think,

1293
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,360
look,
when I started working out,

1294
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:52,710
when I was a kid,
I was,

1295
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,650
I was weighed about 130 pounds and I was
six foot one.

1296
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:58,200
It was a thin kid and I smoked a lot.
I wasn't in good shape.

1297
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,533
I wasn't in good physical shape and I 
went to the gym and it was bloody 

1298
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:02,640
embarrassing,
you know,

1299
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,810
when people would come over and help me 
with the goddamn weights,

1300
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,880
here's how you're supposed to use this,
you know,

1301
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,783
it was humiliating and maybe I was 
pressing 65 pounds or something at that 

1302
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:12,570
point,
you know,

1303
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:13,404
but what am I going to do?
I'm going to lift up 150 pounds and 

1304
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,640
injure myself right off the bat.
No.

1305
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:18,474
I had to go in there and strip down and 
put my skinny goddamn self in front of 

1306
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:22,134
the mirror and think son of a bitch.
There's all these monsters in the gym 

1307
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:25,643
who'd been lifting weights for 10 years 
and I'm struggling to get 50 pounds off 

1308
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:30,180
the bar.
Tough luck for me,

1309
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:31,283
but I could lift 50 pounds and it wasn't
very long until I could lift 75 and 

1310
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,371
well,
you know,

1311
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:36,690
how it goes,
but,

1312
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,633
and I never injured myself when I was 
weightlifting and the reason for that 

1313
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:41,454
was I never pushed myself past where I 
knew I could go and I pushed myself a 

1314
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,020
lot.

1315
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:46,853
You know,
I gained 35 pounds of muscle in about 

1316
01:03:48,211 --> 01:03:49,044
three years in university.
I kind of had to quit because I was 

1317
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:53,010
eating so god damn much.
I couldn't stand it.

1318
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,310
SeeMing like six meals a day.
It was just taken up too much time.

1319
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,743
but there's a humility in determining 
what it is that the wretched creature 

1320
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,150
that you are can actually manage.
Aim low.

1321
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,900
And I don't mean don't aim and I don't 
mean don't aim up,

1322
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:08,603
but you have to accept the fact that you
can set yourself a goal that you can 

1323
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:13,434
attain and there's not going to be much 
glory and to begin with because if 

1324
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:18,570
you're not in very good shape,
the goal that you could,

1325
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:21,450
they could attain tomorrow isn't very 
glorious,

1326
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,823
but it's a hell of a lot better than 
nothing and it beats the hell out of 

1327
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:27,450
bitterness and it's way better than 
blaming someone else.

1328
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,270
It's way less dangerous and you could do
it.

1329
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,313
And what's cool about it,
there's a statement in the new 

1330
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:36,750
testament,
it's called the matthew principle,

1331
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:37,584
and economists use it to describe how 
the economy in the world works to those 

1332
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:42,960
who have everything more will be given 
from those who have nothing.

1333
01:04:42,961 --> 01:04:43,794
Everything will be taken.
So like what's very pessimistic in some 

1334
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:46,974
sense,
because it means that as you start to 

1335
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:49,680
fail,
you fail more and more rapidly.

1336
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,470
But it also means that as you start to 
succeed,

1337
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:56,960
you succeed more and more rapidly.
And so you take an incremental step in,

1338
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,800
well now you can lift 55 pounds instead 
of 52 point five pounds.

1339
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,060
You think,
well what the hell is that?

1340
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:07,120
It's like it's one step on a very long 
journey and so it's.

1341
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,373
And it starts to compound on you.
So a small step today means puts you in 

1342
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:14,430
a position to take a slightly bigger 
step the next day.

1343
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,263
And then that puts you in a position to 
take a slightly bigger step the next 

1344
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,390
day.
And you do that for two or three years,

1345
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:20,770
man,
you're starting to stride.

1346
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,023
You know,
when I have so many people coming up to 

1347
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:23,764
me now,
this is one of the things that's so 

1348
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:27,400
insanely fun about this tour,
which is so positive.

1349
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:30,190
It's,
it brings me to tears regularly.

1350
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,233
It's mind boggling because people come 
up to me and this is happening wherever 

1351
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:35,204
I go now.
And they say they're very polite when 

1352
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,020
they come and talk to me,
you know,

1353
01:05:39,021 --> 01:05:40,700
and they're always apologetic for 
interrupting.

1354
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,563
And so it's never,
it's never narcissistic and it's never 

1355
01:05:44,301 --> 01:05:45,134
annoying.
I'm really happy to see people and they 

1356
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:47,810
come up to me and they say,
well,

1357
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:49,730
I know you've heard this lots of times 
before,

1358
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:50,863
but I've really,
I've really been putting my life 

1359
01:05:52,611 --> 01:05:54,290
together since I've been watching your 
lectures.

1360
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,770
then they tell me a story about where 
they were in some dark place,

1361
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,420
too much alcohol,
too much drugs,

1362
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:01,850
not getting along with her father,
not getting along with her mother,

1363
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:04,070
not having a vision for their life,
being nihilistic,

1364
01:06:04,071 --> 01:06:06,020
playing too many video games,
you know,

1365
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,260
like,
um,

1366
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,070
being suicidal that,
that happens a lot.

1367
01:06:10,071 --> 01:06:13,460
Having posttraumatic stress disorder 
sometimes as a consequences of combat,

1368
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:15,890
whatever little slice of hell they were 
occupied,

1369
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,061
they say,
look,

1370
01:06:17,061 --> 01:06:18,920
I've been,
I've been listening to your lectures and

1371
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:19,754
I've been developing a vision for my 
life and I've been trying to take 

1372
01:06:21,471 --> 01:06:22,304
responsibility and I've been trying to 
tell the truth and things are way 

1373
01:06:25,011 --> 01:06:28,130
better.
And so that's absolutely perfect.

1374
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:30,530
it's,
it's the right way forward as far as I'm

1375
01:06:30,531 --> 01:06:32,180
concerned.
And those are people who,

1376
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:33,860
they took stock of themselves.
They said,

1377
01:06:33,861 --> 01:06:34,694
I'm in a dark place and I'm a dark 
person and here's some things that this 

1378
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:41,750
dark person in this dark place could do.

1379
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,210
Little things that they could actually 
do.

1380
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,520
I'll clean up my damn room.
I'll make my bed.

1381
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:47,443
I've had,
I don't know how many people have come 

1382
01:06:48,981 --> 01:06:50,660
and told me.
It's so strange.

1383
01:06:50,661 --> 01:06:51,021
He said,
well,

1384
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:53,270
I started making my bed and that made 
all the difference.

1385
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:54,171
It's like,
well,

1386
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:55,820
yeah,
you decide a day mop man,

1387
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,953
and the first concrete instantiation of 
that was that you made your bed and you 

1388
01:06:59,571 --> 01:06:59,841
think,
well,

1389
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:01,250
that's nothing heroic.
It's like,

1390
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,080
no,
but aiming up his heroic,

1391
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,093
that something and then lowering 
yourself to the point where you're not 

1392
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:11,660
above the mess in your room.
You know you're not super ordinate too,

1393
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:15,740
that you lower yourself so that you 
straighten up your grateful for what you

1394
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:18,440
have right in front of you and you take 
care of it and you put it in order.

1395
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,453
It's like all of a sudden things start 
to get better and so wonderful to be 

1396
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:25,430
doing this tour because see,
I see,

1397
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:27,890
so that's what this tour has been about.
For me.

1398
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:28,813
It's not political.
I never talked to people after the 

1399
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:32,180
talks.
For example,

1400
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:35,600
I talked to about 150 people a night.
We never talk about anything political.

1401
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,590
It's always this.
I wasn't doing very well.

1402
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,650
I'm putting my life together.
I'm getting along better with my father.

1403
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:44,710
I'm getting along better with my wife.
I'm getting along better with my kids.

1404
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,140
I've got some meaning in my life.
Thanks a lot.

1405
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,520
It's way better.
It's like,

1406
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:50,020
yes,
that's.

1407
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:52,923
That's the right thing and it's very 
beneficial for people and they need to 

1408
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:57,154
hear that and there's something that 
comes along with that that's critical 

1409
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:02,723
and what that is is an honest assessment
of yourself and honesty that that type 

1410
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,300
of honesty,
honesty with yourself.

1411
01:08:11,301 --> 01:08:12,134
It's very difficult for some people and 
they don't have the tools for it and 

1412
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:15,860
they haven't been explained to do this.

1413
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,603
Why you should.
Yeah.

1414
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,580
One of the things that happens when you 
go through school,

1415
01:08:19,581 --> 01:08:21,920
you're told what to do.
You're Never told how to think.

1416
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,740
He never told that you're okay the way 
you are.

1417
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:27,440
That's self esteem.
You're okay the way you are.

1418
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:27,921
It's like,
no,

1419
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:28,754
you're not,
and this is another thing where you are 

1420
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:33,590
and you're not right.
You're okay as a human look,

1421
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:34,424
if you want to be a black belt in 
jujitsu and you just started your first 

1422
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:38,390
class,
you're okay as you are,

1423
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:42,230
you are human,
but in the goal you're not okay,

1424
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:43,363
and the greater goal,
the incremental improvement is 

1425
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:46,400
important.
You have to.

1426
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:49,670
You have to honestly assess your 
position and move forward.

1427
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,540
Well,
that's it.

1428
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,980
You're a position in the trajectory.
Yes.

1429
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,950
Right,
and when you say to someone,

1430
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:56,023
you're okay because of your position,
that's not good enough because you have 

1431
01:08:58,671 --> 01:08:59,091
to say,
well,

1432
01:08:59,091 --> 01:08:59,660
wait a second.

1433
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,493
You need a trajectory and maybe you're 
okay if you're okay and your position 

1434
01:09:03,261 --> 01:09:04,094
and your trajectory,
but you know the self esteem movement 

1435
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:08,600
and all of that will accept yourself the
way you are.

1436
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:12,020
It's like,
no because you need a trajectory and one

1437
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:12,854
of the things that that I think one of 
the reasons that audiences are 

1438
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,184
responding to what I've been saying in 
my lectures and what I've been writing 

1439
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:22,270
about is that I don't tell people that 
they're okay the way they are now.

1440
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:22,691
I say,
no,

1441
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,260
no,
you could be way more than you are,

1442
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,330
and they're relieved about that.
You see,

1443
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:27,164
because if you're in a dark and terrible
place and someone says you're okay the 

1444
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:31,244
way you are,
then you don't know what to do about 

1445
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:32,840
that.
It's like,

1446
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,673
no,
I'm not.

1447
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,710
I'm having to having a terrible time and
I'm hopeless.

1448
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:37,940
You're okay the way you are.

1449
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,950
Well then what?
What?

1450
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,060
That's it.
That's it.

1451
01:09:41,061 --> 01:09:43,550
That's where I am and what do you want 
to tell a young person,

1452
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:44,960
you're 17 year,
okay,

1453
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:45,800
the way you are.
It's like,

1454
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:46,634
no,
you're not.

1455
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:49,760
You've got 60 years to be better and you
could be way better.

1456
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:53,930
You could be in comparable,
better across multiple dimensions and in

1457
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:54,764
pursuing that better.
That's where you'll find the meaning in 

1458
01:09:56,331 --> 01:09:58,880
your life and that will give you the 
antidote to the suffering.

1459
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,400
The way I always describe it to 
people's,

1460
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:03,740
there are disciplines that you can 
pursue.

1461
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:06,950
Those disciplines are a vehicle for 
developing your human potential,

1462
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,233
and if you get better at these things,
you can get better at anything and if 

1463
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:11,894
you figure out what it takes to become 
better at whatever sport it is or 

1464
01:10:15,861 --> 01:10:17,480
whatever art it is,
or whatever,

1465
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:22,160
you're pursuing the same principles you 
can apply to the way you treat people,

1466
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,440
you can apply to the way you educate 
yourself.

1467
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,750
You can apply to wait.
You keep your body in shape.

1468
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:27,913
All those things are connected and 
that's why you have to import impose 

1469
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:31,274
order.
People have asked me in my book why I 

1470
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,180
wrote it as an antidote to chaos.
You know,

1471
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,260
because,
well,

1472
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,110
there isn't anything technically wrong 
with chaos.

1473
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:41,450
Chaos is a place of great potential.
Well,

1474
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:42,284
the question is what's the proper?
What's the proper balance between chaos 

1475
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:47,360
and order?
Chaos potential in order.

1476
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:49,520
While the answer is,
look,

1477
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:51,110
when you're a kid,
you're all potential.

1478
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,183
It's chaotic potential.
It can manifest itself in any number of 

1479
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:57,140
ways and maybe you don't want to give 
that up so you're like peter pan,

1480
01:10:57,141 --> 01:10:57,974
you want to be a kid forever because you
don't want to give up the potential and 

1481
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:02,330
you look out in the world and all you 
see are captain hook's,

1482
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:03,164
you know,
who've lost a hand who were chased by 

1483
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:07,100
death because that's the clock and the 
crocodile.

1484
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:10,580
It's already got a taste of them 
terrified by death and he's a tyrant.

1485
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,080
Well,
I don't want to grow up to be that,

1486
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,860
so I won't be at all.

1487
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,083
Well that's no good because the way the 
potential transforms itself into 

1488
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:20,790
actuality is through discipline.
And so then you,

1489
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,830
as you said,
this is the trick though.

1490
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:27,960
You have to pick a path of discipline 
whether what path of discipline you have

1491
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:30,450
to pick as a different issue because 
there couldn't be a rule.

1492
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:33,810
The rule could be the rule might not be 
followed.

1493
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:34,644
This rule.
The rule might be you have to follow 

1494
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:38,154
some rules.
So it's a matter rule and the mega rule 

1495
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:43,380
is you have to discipline yourself and 
the issue is,

1496
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:44,214
well,
how that's not really the relevant 

1497
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:47,490
question.
You can pick a disciplinary path.

1498
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:49,980
That's why I often tell my clients,
especially young people,

1499
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:50,341
they say,
well,

1500
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:51,480
I don't know what to do.
It's like,

1501
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,050
that's okay.
nobody does go do something.

1502
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:56,363
Do the best thing that you can think of.
Put the best plan you have into 

1503
01:11:59,551 --> 01:12:00,180
practice.

1504
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,580
It's not going to be perfect and it will
change along the way,

1505
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,270
but it will change partly because you 
become disciplined pursuing the path and

1506
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:07,104
as you become disciplined,
you become wiser and as you become 

1507
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:09,954
wiser,
you become able to formulate better and 

1508
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:12,144
better plans so you can start vaguely 
and confused and develop a plan that's 

1509
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:18,470
not so great and you start to implement 
it and then you,

1510
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:19,443
you.
You accrue incremental wisdom as you 

1511
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:24,540
implement your flawed plan and that 
enables you to fix the plant.

1512
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:28,590
And so that's part of that process of 
incremental self improvement as well.

1513
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,910
One of the more difficult aspects of 
that is personal honesty,

1514
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,833
like being honest with yourself,
being honest with yourself about what 

1515
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:36,110
you're doing.
Self assessment.

1516
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,760
It's very difficult for people.
They don't.

1517
01:12:37,761 --> 01:12:39,020
They're never.
They're never taught it.

1518
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:40,790
It's not something that's encouraged.

1519
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:41,910
No one.
It's dismal.

1520
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,640
I imagine you only got 100.
You only have $100,000

1521
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:47,830
to go buy a house and so you go buy 
gold,

1522
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,480
look at this house and It's like,
jesus,

1523
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:50,620
this house man.
It's like,

1524
01:12:50,621 --> 01:12:52,660
it needs a lot of work.
It's like,

1525
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:53,770
well,
that's all you've got,

1526
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,920
or are you going to pretend that the 
house is okay the way it is?

1527
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:57,993
Are you going to look for where it's 
rotten and where the plumbing doesn't 

1528
01:12:59,561 --> 01:13:00,394
work and where the stove doesn't work.
You have to go and look and see where 

1529
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:04,700
everything needs to be fixed and that's 
like,

1530
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,790
that is harsh man.
But,

1531
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:09,750
and then in order to do that properly,
someone has to have taught you.

1532
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,121
It's,
look,

1533
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:12,040
you aren't your problems.
Well,

1534
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:12,874
you are your most fundamentally that 
which if it confronts it's problems can 

1535
01:13:17,921 --> 01:13:20,550
solve them,
and that's the hero myth in in a,

1536
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,820
in a nutshell,
by the way,

1537
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:24,610
the hero is the person who confronts 
horrible,

1538
01:13:24,611 --> 01:13:27,730
chaotic potential and tames it and make 
something of it right?

1539
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:28,983
That's the fundamental human story,
but the problem is is that you have to 

1540
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:33,970
face what you don't want to face in 
order to fix it.

1541
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,133
Yeah,
and so you look at all the things about 

1542
01:13:36,171 --> 01:13:37,004
yourself that needs to be burned off,
that needed to be dispensed with and 

1543
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,630
that man,
especially at the beginning,

1544
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,464
especially if you're screwed up,
that might be like 95 percent of you 

1545
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,930
just has to go up in flames and it's 
painful.

1546
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:51,350
Even some of that stuff that you have to
burn off doesn't want to die and it will

1547
01:13:51,351 --> 01:13:53,570
scream in agony while you're burning it 
off.

1548
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,613
It's not pleasant,
but if you know that you're the thing 

1549
01:13:56,811 --> 01:13:59,180
that can transcend your problems most 
fundamentally,

1550
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:03,830
if you know you're the thing that if it 
faces the problems can transcend them,

1551
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,040
then you have the faith that would 
enable you to take stock of who you are.

1552
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,093
Then you have to do that in small steps 
because most people don't have 

1553
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:11,034
experience in their problems,
so they really don't know what it even 

1554
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:15,400
feels like.
It seems like an alien concept.

1555
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,440
It seems like something other people can
do,

1556
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,703
but if you do it incrementally,
you can show yourself that you can do 

1557
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:21,851
it.
I mean,

1558
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:25,040
it's one of the reasons why they have a 
belt systems and martial arts.

1559
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:26,950
You start off slow,
oh my god,

1560
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,140
I got a stripe on my white belt.
Oh my god,

1561
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:31,510
I'm a blue belt and you,
you feel improvement.

1562
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,433
Yeah,
and for some people it's the first real 

1563
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:38,020
improvement marked absolute improvement 
in their life.

1564
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:38,830
Yeah,
right.

1565
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:40,690
Well,
that's an interesting thing too,

1566
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:43,120
because right there you've got a bit of 
a measurement system.

1567
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:44,403
We have this system set up online called
the future authoring program and we've 

1568
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:50,380
employed last time we implemented it 
because we've tested it three times.

1569
01:14:50,381 --> 01:14:51,214
We implemented at mohawk college in 
Canada and we had people write about 

1570
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:58,510
their ideal future and also to put in 
measurement strategies.

1571
01:14:58,511 --> 01:14:59,051
It's like,
okay,

1572
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:01,450
here's your ideal future,
here's how you're going to break it into

1573
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:04,120
goals,
here's how you're going to mark progress

1574
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:07,660
towards those goals because you've got 
to be playing a fair game with yourself,

1575
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:09,070
right?
Because when you make progress,

1576
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:09,904
you want to reward yourself,
so you have to identify what the 

1577
01:15:11,531 --> 01:15:12,364
progress is and you have to reward it.
The consequence we had people write a 

1578
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:20,731
future plan for only an hour when they 
came for their school orientation in the

1579
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:21,490
summer before going to.

1580
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:22,323
It's a,
it's a community college and they 

1581
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:28,180
dropped the dropout rate among young men
by 50 percent and is.

1582
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,110
Yeah,
no kidding.

1583
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:31,000
Fifty percent.
Yeah,

1584
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,133
and what that meant was to me,
what that meant was just think about 

1585
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,940
that.
What that means is that these kids being

1586
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,970
educated for 12 years and no one had 
ever sat them down and said,

1587
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:40,804
okay,
what the hell are you doing and why and 

1588
01:15:43,031 --> 01:15:43,990
how are you going to get?
Like,

1589
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:46,120
where do you want to go?
Why do you want to get there?

1590
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,760
How are you going to get there?
How are you going to mark your progress?

1591
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,070
I've never walked them through that 
exercise.

1592
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:52,383
You walk people through that exercise 
just to get them to do that increases 

1593
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:59,070
the probability that they'll stay on 
track by 50 percent does incredible.

1594
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:00,423
Well,
it's one of the things I've always 

1595
01:16:00,711 --> 01:16:04,670
complained about is that they know one 
or two people teach you facts.

1596
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,920
They don't teach you how to approach 
life.

1597
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,113
They don't teach you how to think.
They don't teach you how to confront 

1598
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:15,160
white insecurities and different traps 
that your mind will set up for you.

1599
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:16,873
Yeah,
well that's what partly what's so fun 

1600
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:18,374
about doing this lecture to her because 
that's exactly what I'm talking to 

1601
01:16:20,211 --> 01:16:22,340
people about.
One of the things I talk about is,

1602
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:23,270
well,
why do you think?

1603
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,760
Why bother thinking?
It's like,

1604
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:26,571
think.
Well,

1605
01:16:26,571 --> 01:16:27,620
that's obvious.
It's like,

1606
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,300
no,
actually it's not so obvious.

1607
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,640
It's like the.
The.

1608
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:33,430
The issue that I discussed with my 
students at university a lot is,

1609
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:34,910
well,
why write a good essay?

1610
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,570
Why bother?
Well to get the grade.

1611
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:38,404
It's like,
no,

1612
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:41,260
that's not why,
and if you think that,

1613
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,280
well that's better than not thinking 
that there's any reason for writing,

1614
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,820
but it's a bad reason why.
Right?

1615
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:47,500
Well,
writing is a form of thinking.

1616
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,890
It's actually the most demanding form of
thinking.

1617
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:52,690
I would say.
there's other forms that are demanding,

1618
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:58,840
so how do you write a good essay?
Pick a topic that matters to you because

1619
01:16:58,841 --> 01:17:01,000
if you're not writing about something 
that matters to you,

1620
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:04,120
it's like you're not living something 
that's meaningful.

1621
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,073
It's wrong.
You're not going to write a good essay 

1622
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:07,361
because you're wrong.
Right?

1623
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:08,800
To begin with,
it has to matter to you.

1624
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:10,400
Well,
why does it matter?

1625
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,410
What?
What does it mean that it matters?

1626
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:13,843
Well,
it means that it's going to affect how 

1627
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:15,584
you make decisions in your life.
Something that matters affects how you 

1628
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:20,240
make decisions in your life.
Well,

1629
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:22,490
why does it matter how you make 
decisions in your life?

1630
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,803
Because if you make stupid decisions,
you're going to increase the sum total 

1631
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:28,814
of suffering a lot.
You're going to do stupid things to 

1632
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:31,784
yourself.
You're going to do stupid things to 

1633
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:36,230
other people and you're not going to be 
as good a person as you could be.

1634
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:38,300
So not only will you do stupid and 
terrible things,

1635
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:39,134
but you won't have manifested the good 
in the world that you could have 

1636
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:43,180
manifest.
So that's the luck.

1637
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,550
So you write an essay so that you can 
think and you think so that you can live

1638
01:17:46,551 --> 01:17:48,740
properly and so you're right damn 
carefully.

1639
01:17:48,741 --> 01:17:49,574
You make sure that every single bloody 
word is a word that you want to use and 

1640
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:53,594
you make sure the phrases that you put 
the words in or as solid as they can be 

1641
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,163
and you make sure the sentences are well
constructed and that they're organized 

1642
01:17:59,631 --> 01:18:00,464
into proper paragraphs and paragraphs 
are sequenced and the content of the 

1643
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:04,244
thing matters and you put your soul into
it and you know when you've done that 

1644
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,110
because it's gripping.
When you write,

1645
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:12,230
it's meaningfully engaging.
And this is another thing that I've been

1646
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:16,550
sharing with my audiences,
meaning is actually an instinct like you

1647
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:17,510
think,
okay,

1648
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:21,890
so we already decided that incremental 
self improvement is the proper route.

1649
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,623
Okay?
So how do you know when you're 

1650
01:18:24,021 --> 01:18:26,180
incrementally self improving properly?

1651
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,420
And the answer is it's deeply engaging.
IT's deeply meaningful,

1652
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:30,343
and the reason for that is you're 
actually adapted neurologically to 

1653
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:36,380
identify the pathway of maximal 
incremental improvement.

1654
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:37,723
That was a discovery conceptually by guy
named vygotsky who was a russian 

1655
01:18:40,611 --> 01:18:43,670
neuropsychologist who coined the term 
zone of proximal development.

1656
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,010
You here now and then people say they're
in the zone.

1657
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:50,430
That's the zone of proximal development 
and that's that place that you occupy.

1658
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:53,630
When you're improving at the rate that's
optimal to you,

1659
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:54,703
and your sense of intrinsic meaning 
signifies that that's how you're bloody 

1660
01:18:57,771 --> 01:19:00,290
brain is wired.
And so then you might say,

1661
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,124
well,
what's the antidote to the tragedy and 

1662
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:05,030
malevolence of life?
And the answer is to put yourself in the

1663
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:05,864
zone of proximal development because 
that's where the maximum meaning is and 

1664
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:11,660
that actually does prepare you for life.
And so the question,

1665
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,793
why think as well,
you think before you act and you act to 

1666
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:16,843
put yourself in the zone of proximal 
development and you do that too as an 

1667
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:21,530
antidote to the catastrophe of life.

1668
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,810
Well,
that's the.

1669
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:23,840
Well,
that's the answer.

1670
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,120
And the thing that's cool about that,
this is a thing,

1671
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:31,040
part of what I've been telling people,
that sort of novel as well.

1672
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,100
Where's the meaning?
the meaning is in responsibility.

1673
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,530
You know,
because people avoid response.

1674
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,840
That's peter pan again,
avoid responsibilities,

1675
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:40,130
just a burden.
It's like no,

1676
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:41,450
it's not.
It is a burden,

1677
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,553
but voluntarily hoisted.
It's the place of maximum meaning and 

1678
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:48,020
the more responsibility you take,
the more meaning you have.

1679
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,600
And that's the antidote to the 
catastrophe of life.

1680
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:51,763
And,
and everybody also knows this because 

1681
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:57,030
just look so simple.
When you are,

1682
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:58,940
you sick of yourself.
Well,

1683
01:19:58,941 --> 01:19:59,774
that's when you're being useless and 
irresponsible for yourself and for your 

1684
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:03,854
family and for your community.
You're not even taking care of yourself 

1685
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:09,450
well,
you sleep with a clean conscience unless

1686
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:10,284
you're a psychopath,
like if you're not taking care of 

1687
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:12,054
yourself.

1688
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:15,090
And then when can you,
when are you not awake in the morning,

1689
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:15,924
at three in the morning,
tearing yourself apart with a guilty 

1690
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:20,130
conscience.
It's when you've done something useful,

1691
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:22,710
at least for you,
you know when you can say,

1692
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:24,540
oh well,
check one on my side.

1693
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,531
You say,
okay,

1694
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:26,364
so fine.
You talked a little responsibility for 

1695
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:29,640
yourself and you can sleep with a clean 
conscience.

1696
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,660
What happens if you adopted full 
responsibility for yourself and then for

1697
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:34,494
your family?
Lots of the people that are coming to 

1698
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:38,940
talk to me say now I've been really 
trying to put my family together.

1699
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,223
Like I've made that a goal.
I'm trying to heal my family and bring 

1700
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:44,970
it together and it's working.
So here's a story.

1701
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,100
I love this story,
man.

1702
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:49,920
It just killed me.
I was in la at the orpheum and you know,

1703
01:20:49,921 --> 01:20:50,754
it's rough downtown in la,
places around the orpheum to and tammy 

1704
01:20:53,971 --> 01:20:54,804
and I,
my wife,

1705
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,540
because she's traveling with me and is a
big help by the way.

1706
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:03,510
We're wandering around downtown la that 
morning after the talk and we're walking

1707
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:05,880
down the street and we were on streets.
We probably Shouldn't have been on,

1708
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:06,923
but in any case,
because what the hell do we know being 

1709
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:11,280
stupid canadians,
and so we're walking down the street and

1710
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:12,203
this car pulled up beside.
It's this kid hopped out and it's good 

1711
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,480
looking latino kid,
20,

1712
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:16,470
21,
something like that.

1713
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,810
He jumped over and he said,
he's all excited.

1714
01:21:18,811 --> 01:21:19,644
He said,
are you dr?

1715
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,640
Peterson said,
yeah,

1716
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:21,503
yeah.
And he said,

1717
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,190
I'm really,
really happy to meet you.

1718
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:27,290
I've been watching your lectures for 
like a year and a half and uh,

1719
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,690
I've been trying to put my life together
and it's really working.

1720
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,740
I'm really doing way better.
I really wanted to thank you.

1721
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:36,210
And so it's lovely a when you're walking
down and kind of rough area and somebody

1722
01:21:36,211 --> 01:21:37,044
pulls up beside you and they jump out of
the car to tell you how much better 

1723
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:40,314
their life is.

1724
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,210
That's a pretty good morning.
And so.

1725
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:43,680
But then that is no,
that happened.

1726
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,870
He ran back to his car.
He said,

1727
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:46,704
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1728
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:47,703
We went back to his car and he got out 
his dad and they came over together and 

1729
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,480
his dad was just smiling away,
like a real smile,

1730
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:55,314
you know,
and so as the kid and they had their 

1731
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:57,174
arms around each other and they said,
look like we've really been working on 

1732
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:02,130
our relationship for the last year and a
half and it's cold and just create,

1733
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:04,200
we want to thank you.
And the father said something like,

1734
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:06,300
I'm really happy that you got my son 
back to me.

1735
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,560
It's like,
yes,

1736
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,170
that's what this bloody tour has been 
like.

1737
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,243
It's great.
And everybody that's coming to these 

1738
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:15,030
talks,
that's what they're trying to do.

1739
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,253
You know,
I goT 3000 people in each audience and 

1740
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:18,534
what they're trying to do is figure out 
how can I take maximal responsibility 

1741
01:22:21,841 --> 01:22:22,710
for my own life?

1742
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,693
How can I am bw it with the meaning that
helps me with stan tragedy and 

1743
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:26,994
suffering.
How can I be a better person and 

1744
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:29,663
wouldn't it be great if that was of 
optimal benefit to my family and the 

1745
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:34,180
community.
You get very emotional about that.

1746
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,620
It's something joe jesus,
I've seen like 150,000

1747
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:40,050
people in the last two months,
you know,

1748
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:41,430
and this is what it's.
Well,

1749
01:22:41,431 --> 01:22:43,530
you'll have a chance to talk to reuben 
about this too.

1750
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:45,450
This is what it's been like.
It's so positive.

1751
01:22:45,451 --> 01:22:46,284
I can't believe it.
It's just one person after another 

1752
01:22:48,721 --> 01:22:49,620
saying like,
look,

1753
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:51,660
I was,
I was having a rough time.

1754
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,853
I'm really happy that I've been 
encountering what you've been talking 

1755
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:55,554
about.
I've really been trying to put things 

1756
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:58,340
together and it's really helping.
You havE.

1757
01:22:58,341 --> 01:23:01,680
Ruben was pretty blown away by it.
We had a long conversation about it,

1758
01:23:01,681 --> 01:23:02,514
about he just feels like there's some 
crazy movement going on if something's 

1759
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,040
changing in the world

1760
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,873
because of this,
this new avenue of learning and 

1761
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:10,900
development is opening up

1762
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:12,070
for these people.
Well,

1763
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,280
I know I've been thinking about that too
because you know,

1764
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,770
you,
like I said at the beginning,

1765
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:16,723
if you're surfing,
you don't want to take responsibility 

1766
01:23:18,141 --> 01:23:19,220
for the wave.
And so,

1767
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:20,150
you know,
I mean,

1768
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:20,983
first of all,
a lot of what I've been telling people 

1769
01:23:22,191 --> 01:23:25,220
are things that I've gleaned from the 
clinical literature in the psychological

1770
01:23:25,221 --> 01:23:27,500
literature.
It's not like I'm coming up with this of

1771
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:28,520
my own accord,
right?

1772
01:23:28,521 --> 01:23:30,830
I'm transmitting information that I've 
learned from very,

1773
01:23:30,831 --> 01:23:33,170
very wise people.
And so there's that.

1774
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:37,550
But also we don't want to underestimate 
the utility of the technology,

1775
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,413
right?
Because we have this long form 

1776
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,214
technology now and it's enabling us to 
have this discussion and so we can get 

1777
01:23:43,911 --> 01:23:46,460
deeper into things publicly and 
socially.

1778
01:23:46,461 --> 01:23:48,950
Then we were able to before and I see 
this,

1779
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,970
I see this as a manifestation of that 
and,

1780
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:53,230
and as an.

1781
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,113
And I'm hoping to that maybe maybe 
what's happening because we were going 

1782
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,910
to have a lot of adaptation to do in the
next 20 years.

1783
01:23:58,911 --> 01:24:01,730
As things change so rapidly we can 
hardly comprehend it.

1784
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:05,720
And hopefully the way we're going to be 
able to manage that is to think.

1785
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,453
And hopefully these long form 
discussions will provide the political 

1786
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,400
or provide the public forum for us to 
actually think,

1787
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,890
to actually engage at a deep enough 
level.

1788
01:24:15,891 --> 01:24:16,724
So we built a master the transformations
and I think that's possible and part of 

1789
01:24:20,391 --> 01:24:22,570
the reason that I wrote this book and 
well,

1790
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:23,743
part of the reason that I'd be doing 
what I've been doing for the last 30 

1791
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:28,760
years is because I really have believed 
since 1985,

1792
01:24:28,761 --> 01:24:29,594
something like that,
that the way out of political 

1793
01:24:30,801 --> 01:24:33,770
polarization,
the way out of the excesses of the right

1794
01:24:33,771 --> 01:24:36,350
and the left is through the individual.

1795
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,393
I think the west got that right.
The fundamentaL unit of measurement is 

1796
01:24:40,551 --> 01:24:41,384
the individual and the fundamental task 
of the individual is to engage in this 

1797
01:24:44,811 --> 01:24:45,644
process of humble self improvement.
I believe that's the case and that's 

1798
01:24:48,231 --> 01:24:50,600
where the meaning is and that's where 
the responsibility is.

1799
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:51,823
And I think and I'm hoping that if 
enough people in the west and then and 

1800
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,630
then the rest of the world for that 
matter,

1801
01:24:56,631 --> 01:24:58,940
but we're very polarized in the west 
right now.

1802
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:02,870
If enough people take responsibility for
getting their individual lives together,

1803
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:03,973
then we'll get wise enough so we won't 
let this process of political 

1804
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:10,550
polarization put us back to the same 
places that we went so many times in the

1805
01:25:10,551 --> 01:25:13,310
20th century.
I don't see another antidote for it.

1806
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:15,890
It's not political.
It's ethical.

1807
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:21,400
This is the message that I alWays hear 
from you and this is you as a friend.

1808
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,753
This is the you that I understand,
but this is not how you're commonly 

1809
01:25:26,301 --> 01:25:27,134
represented.
You are the most misrepresented person 

1810
01:25:28,971 --> 01:25:29,804
I've ever met in my life.
I have never seen someone who has so 

1811
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:35,954
much positive that gets ignored and 
where people are looking for any little 

1812
01:25:41,631 --> 01:25:46,100
thing that they could possibly 
misrepresent and switch up and change,

1813
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:51,550
and I'm kind of stunned by it.
I'm really not sure what it is about you

1814
01:25:52,161 --> 01:25:52,994
that's so polarizing with all these 
different people that are deciding that 

1815
01:25:58,761 --> 01:26:03,220
you are some sexist,
transphobic,

1816
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:06,770
evil person.
That's this right wing.

1817
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:09,020
All right.
Figure.

1818
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:12,070
you know,
even to the point where it's,

1819
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:12,993
it's,
it's kind of humorous to me sometimes 

1820
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,020
when I read some of these,
these takes on you.

1821
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:22,190
What do you think that's from?
Like what?

1822
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,430
What is have you.
This is a new thing for you.

1823
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,593
You mean it's only been the last few 
years that you've gone from this 

1824
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:30,344
relatively unknown professor in a 
university in toronto to being this 

1825
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:36,044
worldwide figure where people,
obviously your message is resonating 

1826
01:26:40,971 --> 01:26:41,804
with people in a very huge way,
but the people that are opposing you 

1827
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:50,870
vehemently opposed.
WhaT do you think that is

1828
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:52,063
collected?
Don't like me collectivists and what do 

1829
01:26:54,701 --> 01:26:55,534
you mean by that?
People who think the probably proper 

1830
01:26:58,061 --> 01:27:01,660
unit of analysis in the worlD is a 
political and be group oriented.

1831
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:05,350
The identity politics types don't like 
me at all and they have every reason not

1832
01:27:05,351 --> 01:27:09,190
to because I'm not.
I'm not a fan of identity politics.

1833
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,430
I think things are misrepresented 
fundamentally.

1834
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:13,503
There's other reasons.
I mean I came out against this bill in 

1835
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:16,444
Canada,
bill see 16 that that hyPothetically 

1836
01:27:18,551 --> 01:27:19,384
purported to do nothing else but to 
increase the domain of rights that were 

1837
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:26,030
applied to transsexual people,
but there was a.

1838
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,060
There was plenty more to that.
Bail bad.

1839
01:27:28,061 --> 01:27:29,920
Let me tell you,
and I read the policy,

1840
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:33,280
the policies that went along with it and
it was a compelled speech bill,

1841
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:37,480
and so I opposed it on the grounds that 
the politicians are not supposed to leap

1842
01:27:37,481 --> 01:27:40,930
out of their proper domain and start to 
compel speech.

1843
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,760
It's not the same as forbidding hate 
speech.

1844
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,653
I'm,
I think hate speech should be left the 

1845
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:46,570
hell alone personally for all sorts of 
reasons,

1846
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:50,410
but to compel the contents of speech is 
a whole new thing.

1847
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:53,260
It's never been done before in the 
history of british common law,

1848
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:54,123
english common law,
and it's actually the supreme court in 

1849
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:57,034
the 19 forties in the us said that that 
was not to be allowed and so it was a 

1850
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:02,020
major transgression and they said,
well,

1851
01:28:02,021 --> 01:28:03,490
we're doing it for all the right 
reasons.

1852
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:04,091
It's like,
no,

1853
01:28:04,091 --> 01:28:05,080
no,
you don't get it.

1854
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,213
You don't get to compel speech.
I don't care what your reasons are and 

1855
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:11,410
why should I trust your damn reasons.
Anyways.

1856
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,273
What makes you so st like so that you 
can violate this fundamental principle 

1857
01:28:15,881 --> 01:28:16,714
and I should assume that you're doing it
for nothing but compassion and that 

1858
01:28:18,491 --> 01:28:20,230
you're wise enough to manage that 
property.

1859
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,190
It's like,
sorry.

1860
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,690
No,
I read your policies.

1861
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:26,170
I see what you're up to.
I don't like the collectivists.

1862
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:29,530
I think they're unbelievably dangerous 
and I have reason to believe that.

1863
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,580
So I think that when push comes to 
shove,

1864
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:38,610
if your unit of analysis is the group 
and your worldview is one group and it's

1865
01:28:39,251 --> 01:28:41,250
power claims against all other groups,
that,

1866
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:43,260
that that's not acceptable.
IT's,

1867
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,193
it's tribalism of the worst form and it 
lead to nothing but mayhem and disaster 

1868
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:48,443
and part of the reason you're doing it 
isn't because you're compassionate 

1869
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,040
because you're envious and you don't 
want to take responsibility for your own

1870
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:56,010
life and I'm calling you on it and so 
you don't like me,

1871
01:28:56,011 --> 01:29:00,570
so I must be an outright figure.
I must be a nazi saying your house needs

1872
01:29:00,571 --> 01:29:04,110
a lot of man.
There's a lot of rot in the floorboards.

1873
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,300
The plumbing is leaking,
the water's coming in.

1874
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,190
You're not,
you're not the sage.

1875
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:09,024
And st you think you are,
there's so much work you have to do on 

1876
01:29:11,261 --> 01:29:13,630
yourself that it would damn near kill 
you to take a look at it,

1877
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,120
do everything want

1878
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:16,263
that.
That's why people are responding to you 

1879
01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:18,824
in a negative way,
that they only have their own personal 

1880
01:29:20,211 --> 01:29:21,044
problems,
that they're avoiding the it can't 

1881
01:29:22,131 --> 01:29:22,964
possibly be,
that you represent to them something 

1882
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:26,203
that is either cruel or something that 
is not compassionate about people and 

1883
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:37,290
their differences and their flaws and 
their,

1884
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:38,510
their humanity.

1885
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,653
[inaudible].
I think it's certainly the case that 

1886
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:44,340
their vision that's been generated of me
is gas.

1887
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:48,630
That's what I'm getting at too.
But why is layers say there's.

1888
01:29:48,631 --> 01:29:49,860
Well,
part of it's the,

1889
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,600
the political polarization,
you know,

1890
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,513
at the moment we're viewing almost 
everything that happens in the world 

1891
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:58,350
through a political lens,
at least the journalists at least.

1892
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,670
FIrst of all.
First of all,

1893
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,890
I got it.
I got to make this clear.

1894
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,473
First of all,
I've been treated well by lots of 

1895
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:10,010
journalists really well,
like the best journalists in Canada have

1896
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:12,470
been on my side since about two weeks 
after the bill.

1897
01:30:12,471 --> 01:30:13,304
See 16 thing erupted and those would be 
the journalist that have an independent 

1898
01:30:16,281 --> 01:30:17,114
voice and that are,
that have created their own following 

1899
01:30:19,941 --> 01:30:22,470
and they're in a number of different 
media place.

1900
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:24,440
It's mostly in print.
Okay.

1901
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:27,310
And there's a.
There's a coalition of,

1902
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:30,080
of newspapers in Canada,
the post media group,

1903
01:30:30,081 --> 01:30:32,320
200 newspapers.
They came out fully and supportive.

1904
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:34,160
My stance on,
on bill 60,

1905
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,970
and so there's lots of times that I've 
been treateD properly by journalists.

1906
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:39,103
There's a small number of journalists,
very noisy and a small number of 

1907
01:30:41,661 --> 01:30:42,494
activists,
very well organized who have been on my 

1908
01:30:44,961 --> 01:30:45,794
case right from the beginning.
And those are people who are generally 

1909
01:30:47,991 --> 01:30:51,320
driven by a very radical leftist,
progressive agenda.

1910
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:56,180
And I am not on their side.
I'm on their side as individuals.

1911
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,490
I'm on their side is people Who could 
struggle forward,

1912
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,250
but the collectivist vision,
it's deadly,

1913
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:06,440
but you seem to be the poster boy for 
this very simple characterization.

1914
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:12,440
Like almost a caricature of what,
uh,

1915
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:13,170
the,
the,

1916
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:15,180
the right figurehead is,
it's,

1917
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,053
it's to me as a person who knows you,
it's very strange to watch this take 

1918
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:19,824
place.
And then when they can find anything 

1919
01:31:22,081 --> 01:31:22,914
that you say that could without further 
explanation or definition be 

1920
01:31:29,681 --> 01:31:34,240
misconstrued as appealing to this 
definition of you.

1921
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:36,910
Like for instance,
when all this,

1922
01:31:36,911 --> 01:31:38,170
uh,
when this.

1923
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:42,490
Well I guess they call themselves in 
cells,

1924
01:31:42,491 --> 01:31:45,300
involuntary celebrates when all this 
stuff went down with his car,

1925
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,670
drove his car into a group of people.
it's horrible tragedy.

1926
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,980
One of the things that you talked about 
within cells is that,

1927
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,950
and this was a part of the role,
what was it?

1928
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,260
It was a New York times piece.
Yeah.

1929
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,790
You said one of the cures for this is 
enforced monogamy.

1930
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:05,343
People decided and you know,
I'd never heard that term before quite 

1931
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:09,370
honestly.
And I was like,

1932
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,570
whoa,
what the fuck does that mean?

1933
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:15,850
It's a psychological term.
And What it means is enforced by culture

1934
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:18,300
that it is a good value monogamy.
Yeah.

1935
01:32:18,301 --> 01:32:19,134
Because polygamy,
polygamous societies tend to become 

1936
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:22,360
ultra violent.
Yeah.

1937
01:32:22,361 --> 01:32:23,194
That's been known in the anthropological
literature for a hundred years and 

1938
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,020
certainly leftist anthropologists were 
among those who discovered it.

1939
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:29,873
Like she knew the journalist knew 
perfectly well what I meant by 

1940
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:34,180
enforcement origami,
she has stupid.

1941
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:35,043
It's a,
you use it as if everybody would 

1942
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:38,944
understand it because you're an 
intellectual and because you're a 

1943
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:41,980
professor and assault,
you do.

1944
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:45,430
It was also two minutes out of a two day
conversation,

1945
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:46,264
you know?
It's like,

1946
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,490
so if that's how she glanced.
Oh,

1947
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:49,324
well,
it's so funny.

1948
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,193
That was funny in some sense because my 
sense is if you want to pillory someone 

1949
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,333
you should attribute to them views that 
someone somewhere has had and the 

1950
01:32:58,661 --> 01:32:59,494
implication of that part of the New York
times article was that I wanted to take 

1951
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,713
new bile,
young women at the point of a gun 

1952
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:08,490
understate enforcement and deliver them 
to useless men.

1953
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,900
It's like no one has ever believed that 
trinity sounds like that.

1954
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:15,610
It's a real.
The optics of that statement,

1955
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:18,820
a very bad,
but the question is why didn't.

1956
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:19,683
Why wasn't their followup questions and 
if there was follow up questions to get 

1957
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:24,190
you to define what you mean by 
enforcement.

1958
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:26,680
There were.
They just didn't make it into the piece.

1959
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:28,020
That's a real problem.
Yeah.

1960
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:28,893
It's a real problem.
That's a real problem because that's 

1961
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:31,423
that.
That is.

1962
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:34,990
It's so ridiculous because inaccurate 
definition of who you are,

1963
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:35,993
one of the things I've said continually,
and this is on record in multiple 

1964
01:33:39,761 --> 01:33:40,600
places,
it's like,

1965
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:41,434
okay,
so you're a young man and all the women 

1966
01:33:43,871 --> 01:33:44,830
are rejecting you.

1967
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:49,870
Who's got the problem?
It's not all the women.

1968
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,310
That's a bad road to go down if all the 
women are rejecting you,

1969
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,500
it's you.
We both agree on this,

1970
01:33:56,501 --> 01:34:01,240
but why is enforced monogamy the 
solution for people that are involuntary

1971
01:34:01,241 --> 01:34:02,680
celibates?
Well,

1972
01:34:02,681 --> 01:34:03,514
it's the solution.
It's the solution to the relationship 

1973
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,830
between men and women.
Fundamentally is monogamous.

1974
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:12,640
Social men are unattractive if these on 
attraction to them,

1975
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:14,560
but if these men are on attractive to 
women,

1976
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:16,250
I don't mean just physically 
unattractive.

1977
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:20,920
Women aren't just seeking them as mates.
They need to become men.

1978
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,930
Yes,
they certainly do have the solution.

1979
01:34:22,931 --> 01:34:24,290
that's the solution.
Absolutely.

1980
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:25,143
We both agree on this,
so they need to do that in a society 

1981
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:31,060
where monogamy is the social norm,
the social norm anyway.

1982
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,820
Well,
that was partly my point,

1983
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:36,790
although to the degree that we deviate 
from that,

1984
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,930
we tilt towards a more violent society.
I was making a very minor point.

1985
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:42,760
I don't think they're related quite 
honestly.

1986
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:43,594
I don't think that involuntary celibates
I don't think that having enforced 

1987
01:34:48,181 --> 01:34:51,610
monogamy as a part of our cultural norm 
is going to help those people.

1988
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:53,440
It does.
How's it going to help them?

1989
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:54,423
Well,
because what happens is if a polygamous 

1990
01:34:55,601 --> 01:34:56,680
society develops,

1991
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:00,050
which is the alternative,
then a small minority of men get all the

1992
01:35:00,051 --> 01:35:01,640
women.
That's what happens.

1993
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:06,310
That's the only point is make his theory
theoretical

1994
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:11,330
goal world where polygamous societies 
exist and mass and then you do have this

1995
01:35:13,121 --> 01:35:16,300
problem with is a small group of men 
that are fucking all the women,

1996
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,520
but that's not.

1997
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,650
Or talking and also making the women 
unhappy.

1998
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,533
Right?
Because the women don't have any access 

1999
01:35:21,721 --> 01:35:22,554
to a genuine intimate one to one 
relationship over any long period of 

2000
01:35:25,201 --> 01:35:25,700
time,

2001
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,533
which doesn't work well.
It's the whole idea and what's best 

2002
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,740
women that.
Sure.

2003
01:35:30,741 --> 01:35:31,890
If you have children,
right,

2004
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,713
but I still don't think that that is why
these men are involuntary celibates and 

2005
01:35:37,101 --> 01:35:37,934
I don't think it's the solution to that.
I think the solution is that they need 

2006
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:41,570
to become attractive.

2007
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:42,880
Yes.
That is the solution.

2008
01:35:42,881 --> 01:35:43,621
There's no doubt.
I don't.

2009
01:35:43,621 --> 01:35:45,340
I don't think the two are related.
Well,

2010
01:35:45,341 --> 01:35:47,500
the only.
I was making a minor point.

2011
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:48,543
The minor point was that one of the ways
that societies around the world have 

2012
01:35:51,611 --> 01:35:55,930
figured out that you keep young male 
aggression under control is by enforcing

2013
01:35:55,931 --> 01:35:59,380
monogamous standards because it gives 
everyone a chance in some sense.

2014
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:01,040
That's the only point that out

2015
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:05,050
meaning it clears more,
uh,

2016
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,513
more women will be available for one on 
one relationships rather than one guy 

2017
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,610
who is,
you know,

2018
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:17,010
whatever,
for whatever reason,

2019
01:36:17,011 --> 01:36:17,844
so figure in society,
you see this happening in universities 

2020
01:36:20,871 --> 01:36:21,704
where women outnumber men.
So the man hypothetically have more 

2021
01:36:24,801 --> 01:36:26,840
sexual opportunity,
but that isn't what happens.

2022
01:36:26,841 --> 01:36:30,470
What happens is that a small minority of
men have all the sexual opportunity.

2023
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:34,040
A fairly large minority of men don't.
The women are unhappy because they can't

2024
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:37,460
find a committed relationship.
It's bad for most of the men and the men

2025
01:36:37,461 --> 01:36:39,710
who have all the sexual opportunity get 
cynical,

2026
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:40,953
but isn't this in some ways against your
whole idea of equality of outcome 

2027
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:46,323
because you're,
you're talking about equality of sexual 

2028
01:36:47,651 --> 01:36:48,370
outcome.
Now,

2029
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:49,203
if these men,
if a guy james that's dominant 

2030
01:36:53,771 --> 01:36:56,200
basketball player that just kicks 
everyone's ass,

2031
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,760
this is the,
this,

2032
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:00,460
this is a guy who succeeded at the 
highest level,

2033
01:37:00,461 --> 01:37:01,211
right?
Well,

2034
01:37:01,211 --> 01:37:03,460
there's gonna be people like that 
sexually,

2035
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,620
there's going to be people that are 
better at finding mates and this is what

2036
01:37:08,621 --> 01:37:11,530
they enjoy.
They enjoy having many mates.

2037
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,890
They enjoy being yes,
but,

2038
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,903
but if this is what they enjoy,
if it's a man who doesn't want a family 

2039
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:24,010
and enjoys dating multiple women,
why is that bad?

2040
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:25,343
Well,
I think the fundamental reason it's bad 

2041
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:28,500
is because it's bad in the long run for 
children,

2042
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:31,110
it's bad for children if he chooses to 
have children.

2043
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:32,173
yeah,
well that makes sense.

2044
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,183
But that's it.
That's the fundamental issue as far as 

2045
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:36,360
I'm concerned right now.
I think it's the answer.

2046
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:40,860
Look to give the journalist credit.
That is the point she was making,

2047
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:43,150
you know,
apart from pillaring me and,

2048
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:43,820
and,
and,

2049
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:46,710
and caricatured my perspective.
That was the point she was making.

2050
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:47,731
Well,
first of all,

2051
01:37:47,731 --> 01:37:50,190
I'm not in favor of unbridled 
hierarchies.

2052
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:51,750
Like I already said that,
you know,

2053
01:37:51,751 --> 01:37:52,584
the proclivity of a hierarchy is that 
all the spoils go to the person at top 

2054
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:56,070
and that can

2055
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,903
destabilize the whole structure,
so we have to have a dialogue about how 

2056
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:00,890
to rectify that,
but how

2057
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:02,063
possibly rectified that if one man is,
but like say if we've got one six foot 

2058
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:12,921
five beautiful man who's got a perfect 
body and the brilliant and he just wants

2059
01:38:13,261 --> 01:38:14,094
to date a bunch of women and all the 
rest of the people or five foot one and 

2060
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:19,950
they're fat and they're lazy and like 
this guy is gonna.

2061
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,950
If this is the competition,
he's going to win.

2062
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,810
Yeah,
gap.

2063
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:29,811
There's no way around this and even if 
you decide to have enforced monogamy and

2064
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,273
blair becomes a popular thing,
the women are going to be more drawn to 

2065
01:38:34,771 --> 01:38:36,330
him.
If he chooses to date them,

2066
01:38:36,331 --> 01:38:37,164
they might decide.
I would rather have him sometimes the 

2067
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:43,680
never actually what does happen,
but what is wrong with that?

2068
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:44,993
Well,
what's wrong wIth it is that it 

2069
01:38:46,331 --> 01:38:48,700
destabilized the society and it's bad 
for children.

2070
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:52,030
You said that would have to have 
children,

2071
01:38:52,031 --> 01:38:53,920
but there's a lot of people that don't 
want to have children.

2072
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,903
There's a lot of people that choose to 
go their entire life without having 

2073
01:38:56,891 --> 01:39:00,820
children as men in their thirties and 
some of my friends I've vasectomies they

2074
01:39:00,821 --> 01:39:03,670
don't want children,
so why?

2075
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:08,830
Why would that help in any way?
These involuntary celibate?

2076
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:09,883
Well,
I think you tilt the society so that it 

2077
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:13,340
serves the interests of.
Well,

2078
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:14,803
that's a good question.
Do you see my point where I see your 

2079
01:39:17,571 --> 01:39:18,830
point?
No doubt about it.

2080
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:19,903
You're almost having.
You're almost forcing in inning in an 

2081
01:39:22,601 --> 01:39:23,434
equality of outcome.

2082
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:27,340
I know that was her point to to the 
degree that she had a point that was her

2083
01:39:27,341 --> 01:39:28,174
point now and it's not.
It doesn't run contrary to my opinions 

2084
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,530
that the issue of outcome has to be 
addressed.

2085
01:39:35,531 --> 01:39:38,020
Already saId there's needs to be a 
reason for the left and the right,

2086
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,113
and then the problem with hierarchies is
they can get to steep and destabilize 

2087
01:39:42,521 --> 01:39:43,354
everything that does happen.
That particularly happens in the sexual 

2088
01:39:45,821 --> 01:39:48,400
domain and there's plenty of 
anthropological evidence for that,

2089
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,170
but you still might say,
well,

2090
01:39:50,171 --> 01:39:51,004
who cares?
Because the man who are who are winning 

2091
01:39:53,111 --> 01:39:55,300
should be allowed to win in the women 
should be allowed to choose.

2092
01:39:55,630 --> 01:39:56,463
Yes,
except that there's the problem of 

2093
01:39:58,301 --> 01:40:02,200
children and so society steps in on 
behalf of the children and you can say,

2094
01:40:02,201 --> 01:40:03,034
well,
lots of people don't want to have 

2095
01:40:03,611 --> 01:40:05,020
children.
Yes,

2096
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:05,943
and that's truer now than it used to be.
Although many of those people end up 

2097
01:40:08,351 --> 01:40:09,184
having children anyways,
you know the guys who snooping around 

2098
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:13,390
all the time,
so that doesn't circumvent the problem,

2099
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:15,820
but the issue here for me isn't the man 
or the women,

2100
01:40:15,821 --> 01:40:16,654
it's the children.
We're trying to set up societies where 

2101
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:20,043
the probability that children will be 
raised in something approximating 

2102
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:23,253
optimal environment is optimized and 
that's going to mean sacrifice of 

2103
01:40:25,961 --> 01:40:27,850
opportunity and choice on the part of 
the adults

2104
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,390
necessary.
I agree with you,

2105
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:31,224
but I think the what we're talking about
mirrors what we're talking about in 

2106
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:34,704
sports.
It mirrors what we're talking about in 

2107
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:37,800
business.
It's everything else.

2108
01:40:37,801 --> 01:40:38,634
There's going to be people that are 
better at all different aspects of life 

2109
01:40:42,321 --> 01:40:45,810
is going to be people that are talented 
in terms of like getting women to.

2110
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,390
Yes,
that's true,

2111
01:40:47,391 --> 01:40:49,280
but that's why also look,
you see this,

2112
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,473
women are hypergo,
which means they made up and they meet 

2113
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:56,650
and up dominance hierarchies,
and so if you're a male who's successful

2114
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:57,484
in a given hierarchy,
the probability that you're going to 

2115
01:40:58,721 --> 01:41:01,450
have additional mating opportunities is 
exceptionally high.

2116
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,570
It's an unbelievably good predictor of 
that.

2117
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:07,600
That high is a very uncomfortable 
discussion,

2118
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:09,510
certainly.
Well,

2119
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:11,670
there's plenty of uncomfortable 
discussions too.

2120
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,513
That's a big one though.
It is the idea that it defines women's 

2121
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:18,190
sexual choices by the fact that they 
want beggar bigger,

2122
01:41:18,191 --> 01:41:20,300
better.
Someone who's more,

2123
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:21,333
more successful than someone is so 
higher on the social ladder than what 

2124
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:26,884
they're accustomed to or what they have.
What women do is like make choices is a 

2125
01:41:29,771 --> 01:41:32,130
very difficult problem.
so how do you solve that?

2126
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,430
Well,
here's how women solve it.

2127
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,680
Throw them in a ring,
let them compete it.

2128
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,680
Whatever they're competing at.
Assume that the man who wins is the best

2129
01:41:38,681 --> 01:41:39,880
man.
Marry him.

2130
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,040
Yes,
it's a brilliant solution.

2131
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,053
It's a market oriented solution.
It's actually the solution that appears 

2132
01:41:45,821 --> 01:41:48,550
to have driven our evolutionary 
departure from chimpanzees.

2133
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,990
It's a biological solution solution 
which has a cost.

2134
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:54,800
What is the cost?
Well,

2135
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,713
the cost is the cost is polygamy and so 
we ran that in within forest monogamy 

2136
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,220
and we do that in order to provide 
stable,

2137
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:06,970
stable circumstances for children.
Is polyamorous,

2138
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:12,180
polyamorous society just as unattainable
as this utopian marxist idea?

2139
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,633
I think so because it looks like,
and this is another point I was making 

2140
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:22,630
that didn't get covered in the article,
I wrote about it somewhat extensively on

2141
01:42:22,631 --> 01:42:23,464
my blog,
is that society's tilt towards monogamy 

2142
01:42:26,831 --> 01:42:27,664
across the world is human universal.
Now that doesn't mean that people don't 

2143
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:34,330
have polygamous or polyamorous 
tendencies because they certainly do and

2144
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:35,164
it certainly also the case that one of 
the ways that women gerrymander this 

2145
01:42:37,661 --> 01:42:38,494
system is that the number of women and 
children who are in a say say you're 

2146
01:42:44,681 --> 01:42:47,170
married and you have children with your 
husband,

2147
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:51,700
but you also have an affair,
so we have a child by another mat that's

2148
01:42:51,701 --> 01:42:53,320
more common than anyone suspected.

2149
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:54,543
So part of their weight,
we weigh that women solve the problem 

2150
01:42:56,321 --> 01:42:58,060
that you're just describing,
and I'm,

2151
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,460
I'm not saying anything for this or 
against this,

2152
01:43:00,461 --> 01:43:02,770
this is a purely factual biological 
claim,

2153
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:06,490
is they pick a monogamous marriage and 
they cheat with high status guys.

2154
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:08,553
Now you know,
obviously in the confines of the 

2155
01:43:09,761 --> 01:43:11,140
marriage,
that's a terrible thing,

2156
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:12,423
but that's a very uncomfortable subject 
though for women and protecting her 

2157
01:43:15,901 --> 01:43:16,734
uncomfortable subject for everyone.
But it's a terribly uncomfortable 

2158
01:43:19,361 --> 01:43:20,194
subject.
They don't like the idea that this is a 

2159
01:43:21,851 --> 01:43:22,684
common thing that women choose a safe 
man that is willing to be monogamous 

2160
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:27,904
with them and perhaps maybe they're 
above him in a social class or in a 

2161
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:36,930
sexually and then they'll cheat with 
someone who was taught.

2162
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,860
It's common,
but it's not the norm,

2163
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:41,050
right?
It's still the norm not to do that.

2164
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:42,910
The norm is fidelity,
but,

2165
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:45,940
but there's plenty of exception.
This is enforced monogamy,

2166
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,833
culturally the norm.
This is the very definition of monogamy 

2167
01:43:49,301 --> 01:43:50,200
is this.
It's like,

2168
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,680
okay.
So my son's married

2169
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:52,903
in september and so,
so let's say he comes to me in a year 

2170
01:43:55,761 --> 01:43:56,630
and he says,
hey dad,

2171
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:57,464
guess what?
I've had three affairs in the last year 

2172
01:43:58,731 --> 01:44:00,830
and they've all been successful.
I haven't got caught,

2173
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,100
aren't I a good guy?
What am I going to say to that?

2174
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,503
Know what the hell are you doing?
that's not what you're supposed to be 

2175
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:10,040
doing.
That's enforced monogamy

2176
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:11,893
enforcement.
Origami meaning the people around you 

2177
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:17,870
try to guide them in a way that you 
think is going to lose it's harmonious.

2178
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:19,083
Yes,
it's built deep into the cultural norms 

2179
01:44:20,261 --> 01:44:21,094
and if that starts to destabilize them,
there's trouble and that doesn't mean 

2180
01:44:24,251 --> 01:44:27,460
that it's not prone to all the problems 
that you laid out.

2181
01:44:27,461 --> 01:44:28,294
Look,
there isn't a bigger problem than 

2182
01:44:29,921 --> 01:44:30,754
successful reproduction.
It is the big problem and all of the 

2183
01:44:34,691 --> 01:44:38,500
solutions that we've generated for it 
are full of flaws.

2184
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:41,020
Like here's an example,
the gender paY gap,

2185
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:43,150
okay?
There's no gender pay gap.

2186
01:44:43,151 --> 01:44:45,280
There's a mother gap.
There's other reasons too,

2187
01:44:45,281 --> 01:44:47,830
but women really take a hit when they 
become mothers.

2188
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:49,750
Okay,
that's unfair.

2189
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:50,950
Fair enough,
man.

2190
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:52,520
What the hell are you going to do

2191
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:53,780
about?
It's not just that though,

2192
01:44:53,781 --> 01:44:55,160
right,
and this is what also,

2193
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:56,433
I'm sorry to interrupt you here,
but this is what's one of the things 

2194
01:44:58,221 --> 01:45:00,830
that I wanted to bring up but are kind 
of lost track of it.

2195
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:02,443
The misrepresentation of view mirrors 
the misrepresentation of the gender pay 

2196
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:06,344
gap because it's a convenient 
misrepresentation that upon further 

2197
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:12,740
inspection and understanding you realize
there is no gender pay gap,

2198
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:16,730
the gender pay gap when people discuss 
it that don't understand it and I've had

2199
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:20,930
these conversations with really 
intelligent people that just listened to

2200
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:25,550
what's in the news or read some very 
quick article talking about this problem

2201
01:45:25,551 --> 01:45:29,690
that we have and they assume that a man 
and a woman are working the same job,

2202
01:45:29,691 --> 01:45:33,260
but the woman is unfairly paid seventy 
nine cents to the man's dollar.

2203
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:36,740
That's not the case.
It's not close to the case cases.

2204
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:40,010
Women choose different professions that 
don't pay as much.

2205
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:40,963
They work less hours and they oftentimes
get married and have children and 

2206
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,730
because they have children,
they take paternity leave when they make

2207
01:45:46,731 --> 01:45:47,564
less money and they make less money 
because that the reasons or 20 reasons 

2208
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:52,850
for the gender pay gap,
right?

2209
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,713
One of them being motherhood,
but there's a whole slew of jobs meant 

2210
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:59,000
work outside.
Men are more likely to move,

2211
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:01,020
but it's never discussed.
It's discussed.

2212
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,260
Don't like multivariate problems.
It's not just that it's a.

2213
01:46:04,261 --> 01:46:05,094
It's a willful misrepresentation of 
reality and I think it mirrors this 

2214
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:11,090
willful misrepresentation of where 
you're,

2215
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:14,660
where you stand,
and I think they're all tied in together

2216
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:19,100
with people want bad and good.
They want a one and a zero.

2217
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:20,780
They want things to be very binary.

2218
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:21,813
Yeah.
They will not to be binary in the way 

2219
01:46:22,631 --> 01:46:23,464
they already understand.
They want everything to fit their 

2220
01:46:25,091 --> 01:46:27,760
ideological lens and things are more 
complicated than that.

2221
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:28,713
This is a complex discussion that you're
not going to get in a five minute 

2222
01:46:32,651 --> 01:46:34,110
segment on a talk show.
Right?

2223
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:36,400
Exactly.
Not going to get this on a radio show.

2224
01:46:36,401 --> 01:46:39,580
You're not going to get this in an 
article that gets edited by someone with

2225
01:46:39,581 --> 01:46:40,414
a biased opinion,
and this is the problem with mainstream 

2226
01:46:43,241 --> 01:46:45,370
media and this is the problem with 
ideas,

2227
01:46:45,371 --> 01:46:47,290
period.
Warren farrell's book on,

2228
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:49,950
he wrote a book called warren is the guy
who's

2229
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,813
most,
what would you call it most pilloried 

2230
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:53,154
for?
Pointing out the real reasons for the 

2231
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:56,970
gender pay gap.
he wrote a book called why men make more

2232
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:00,270
hoody rated for his daughters.
Why?

2233
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:03,990
Because he wanted to help provide.
Now obviously he was doing it for public

2234
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:06,420
consumption as well,
but one of the motivations was,

2235
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:07,530
well,
men do make more.

2236
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:10,140
Well why?
And if women want to make more,

2237
01:47:10,141 --> 01:47:13,110
what could they learn from the men who 
make more how to make more?

2238
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:13,944
And the answer is yes.
the question is whether or not they'll 

2239
01:47:15,421 --> 01:47:16,254
do it and the book the probable answers 
most women won't because how much you 

2240
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:22,860
make isn't the only hallmark of success 
in your life.

2241
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:24,293
You know,
iT's like it's one measure and it might 

2242
01:47:26,191 --> 01:47:29,190
be a measure that really competitive men
compete for and they do.

2243
01:47:29,191 --> 01:47:31,930
and that's partly to provide access to,
to,

2244
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:34,320
to,
to increase mating opportunities because

2245
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:35,790
that's built into the structure.

2246
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:38,280
Something we never talk about either,
although we could.

2247
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:42,870
So warren wrote this to lay out all the 
reasons that men make more,

2248
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:43,704
but it was so that his daughters,
at least in part so that his daughters 

2249
01:47:45,901 --> 01:47:48,300
could figure out how to be 
socioeconomically successful.

2250
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:48,751
It's like,
yeah,

2251
01:47:48,751 --> 01:47:49,584
but that's not the only hallmark.
How much socioeconomic success are you 

2252
01:47:51,991 --> 01:47:52,824
willing to sacrifice to spend time with 
your kids before they're three years 

2253
01:47:54,691 --> 01:47:55,800
old?
Well,

2254
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:58,410
the answer to that shouldn't be none,
right?

2255
01:47:58,411 --> 01:48:00,580
Because what makes it look,
we already know this for,

2256
01:48:00,581 --> 01:48:01,414
for example,
once you make enough money to keep the 

2257
01:48:03,391 --> 01:48:04,224
bill collectors at bay.
So that's kinda lower upper working 

2258
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:09,200
class.
Say something like,

2259
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:12,390
even centrist working class.
Keep the bill collectors at bay.

2260
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,960
Additional money doesn't improve your 
quality of life.

2261
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:18,173
Other things do.
So maybe it's a rational response when 

2262
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:24,120
you're like 30.
See the irrational men.

2263
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,400
Here's the irrational man.
Maybe they drive the world,

2264
01:48:26,401 --> 01:48:29,910
but they're the irrational men.
More success is always better.

2265
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,013
Along this unit,
dimensional axis of achievement wasn't 

2266
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:35,910
gecko.
Greed is good.

2267
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:37,920
Well,
there's a tiny percentage of men who are

2268
01:48:37,921 --> 01:48:41,250
hyper competitive along those single 
axis of,

2269
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,660
of,
of competition,

2270
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,870
and maybe they drive most things they 
probably do,

2271
01:48:46,410 --> 01:48:47,243
but that doesn't make them right.
It also doesn't make them most people 

2272
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:51,720
and it doesn't make them happy.
Well,

2273
01:48:51,721 --> 01:48:52,554
happy is a whole different issue,
but that's what they're out of it 

2274
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:58,170
because everyone is well.
You are though in in pursuit of success,

2275
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:01,080
it's implied that happiness goes with 
that success.

2276
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:02,400
Otherwise,
why the fuck are you doing?

2277
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:04,950
Yeah,
well dominic domination,

2278
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:07,440
power back actually,
but that's charisma.

2279
01:49:07,441 --> 01:49:08,274
Prestige while he applied it is success 
and happiness or an extra bleak 

2280
01:49:12,631 --> 01:49:15,240
connected in our perception.
Yeah.

2281
01:49:15,241 --> 01:49:17,340
Well,
there's often a flawed equation,

2282
01:49:17,690 --> 01:49:19,770
you know,
like what happens.

2283
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:21,930
Look,
I workEd in law firms with law firms for

2284
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:24,810
a very long period of time and I worked 
for lots of high end women,

2285
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:28,530
lots of and they were like,
they were usually extremely attractive.

2286
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:30,900
They were extremely intelligent.
They were extremely driven.

2287
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:32,550
They were very,
very conscientious.

2288
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:34,860
They varied in how agreeable they were 
somewhere.

2289
01:49:34,861 --> 01:49:37,560
Disagreeable litigator types in,
some were more agreeable.

2290
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:39,750
They often had a harder time in the law 
firms,

2291
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:42,330
but the law firms lose all their women 
in the thirties.

2292
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:46,290
They all bail out at partner level.
a lot of them will say,

2293
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:48,370
jesus,
yeah,

2294
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:49,283
it's a good percentage.
It's a huge percentage and it isn't 

2295
01:49:51,101 --> 01:49:52,510
because of the law firms don't want 
them.

2296
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:55,990
The law firms want them because you 
can't find people like that.

2297
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:58,200
They're really rare,
especially if they're also rainmakers,

2298
01:49:58,210 --> 01:49:59,043
if they can bring in money.
So the law firms bend themselves over 

2299
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:02,230
backwards trying to keep the women.

2300
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,640
It can't keep them.
Why?

2301
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,020
Well,
the women decide that,

2302
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,410
oh,
I'm working 18 hours a day,

2303
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,660
flat out all the time,
seven days a week.

2304
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:15,910
My husband makes a fair bit of money.
If I made half as much money as I made,

2305
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:19,660
we'd still have plenty of money.
Why am I working 18 hours a day?

2306
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:21,850
Well,
that's not the question.

2307
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:26,710
The question is why would anyone work 18
hours a day?

2308
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,033
that's the mystery and the answer is a 
small minority of men are driven to do 

2309
01:50:32,061 --> 01:50:34,940
that and so they'll do that no matter 
where you put these guys.

2310
01:50:34,941 --> 01:50:36,680
That's what they do.
Okay,

2311
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:38,420
but that.
Does that mean it's correct?

2312
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:40,070
I think there's something wrong with 
these women.

2313
01:50:40,071 --> 01:50:42,140
They hit 30,
they've hit partner,

2314
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:43,123
they've hit the pinnacle.
I mean they could keep going if they 

2315
01:50:45,271 --> 01:50:47,130
want him to,
but they've accomplished their goal.

2316
01:50:47,131 --> 01:50:50,370
They've definitely shown man,
they're bloody well in the game and they

2317
01:50:50,371 --> 01:50:52,470
wake up at 30 and they think,
oh,

2318
01:50:52,471 --> 01:50:55,590
wait a minute,
I want to have a relationship and also I

2319
01:50:55,591 --> 01:50:56,424
want to have some time to put into that.
I'd like to have kids and I'd actually 

2320
01:50:59,191 --> 01:51:01,320
like to see my kids.
It's like,

2321
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:02,670
is that a rational?

2322
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:06,490
This is another thing that you and I are
in agreement on,

2323
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,390
but when I see people talk about the way
you discuss women,

2324
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:11,253
they misrepresent what you're saying and
paint you in what I think willfully 

2325
01:51:17,561 --> 01:51:19,180
paint you.
They do it on purpose.

2326
01:51:19,181 --> 01:51:20,580
They paint us a massage.
Ernest,

2327
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,113
I don't understand why I don't 
understand if it is because they 

2328
01:51:24,881 --> 01:51:25,714
disagree with you on things,
so this is a convenient way to demonize 

2329
01:51:28,331 --> 01:51:30,880
your position by demonizing you as a 
human being.

2330
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:32,470
Um,
but

2331
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,731
well,
it's partly too,

2332
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:36,640
because I've made the case that there 
are differences between men and women.

2333
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:37,533
Yes.
But like why that isn't a feminist case 

2334
01:51:39,271 --> 01:51:40,690
is beyond me.
It's like,

2335
01:51:40,691 --> 01:51:42,010
no,
they're exactly the same.

2336
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,000
no,
they're not.

2337
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,990
It's ridiculous.
It is.

2338
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:45,880
And it's confusing.
It's confusing.

2339
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,133
Purposefully.
Confusing thing is the data in so look 

2340
01:51:51,150 --> 01:51:53,100
and people have accused me of pseudo 
science,

2341
01:51:53,101 --> 01:51:53,934
you know,
which I already think is quite comical 

2342
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:57,430
because the studies that I'm reporting 
aren't.

2343
01:51:57,630 --> 01:51:59,560
Who's accused you of pseudo,
oh god.

2344
01:51:59,561 --> 01:52:01,600
Journalists.
Journalists of all stripes.

2345
01:52:01,601 --> 01:52:04,270
Especially when I talk about differences
between men and women,

2346
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:04,721
it's like,
oh,

2347
01:52:04,721 --> 01:52:05,830
that pseudo science.
It's like,

2348
01:52:05,831 --> 01:52:06,401
actually,
no,

2349
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:08,110
it's not,
it's bloody mainstream science,

2350
01:52:08,111 --> 01:52:10,720
both biology and psychology,
but why do they like to do that?

2351
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:11,883
Well,
because it seems to be there's a reason 

2352
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:18,361
that goes along with the radical leftist
agenda that if there are that a world of

2353
01:52:18,981 --> 01:52:22,040
equality of outcome could not be 
achieved and that's the desirable world.

2354
01:52:22,190 --> 01:52:24,410
If there are actually differenceS 
between people,

2355
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:28,550
actual differences like that aren't just
socio culturally constructed so that you

2356
01:52:28,551 --> 01:52:30,620
can gerrymander.
There's also something as well,

2357
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:31,663
if you're really power mad,
you want to believe that human beings 

2358
01:52:34,221 --> 01:52:35,054
are infinitely malleable because then 
you can mold them in whatever image you 

2359
01:52:37,221 --> 01:52:40,160
want and if you say no,
they actually have a character,

2360
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:41,173
right?
There's something built in then that 

2361
01:52:42,381 --> 01:52:46,070
interferes with the totalitarian regime.
But here's happened is like,

2362
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:48,650
look,
we've got a good personality model.

2363
01:52:48,830 --> 01:52:50,810
We've had it for about 40 years,
something like that.

2364
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:53,540
The big five model,
five dimensions of personality,

2365
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:54,523
and they were established statistically 
a theoretically by left-leaning 

2366
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,490
psychologists.
Okay?

2367
01:52:58,491 --> 01:53:01,340
And I'm not saying that they're 
ideological contaminated,

2368
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:02,593
but what I am saying is there's no 
evidence whatsoever that right wing 

2369
01:53:05,331 --> 01:53:06,164
leaning psychologists produced the big 
five because there are no right leading 

2370
01:53:09,261 --> 01:53:11,390
psychologists.
So enough of that,

2371
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:13,100
that isn't why the big five came up.

2372
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:14,203
Okay.
So once you have a good personality 

2373
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:15,861
model,
you can say,

2374
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:16,694
okay,
well we'll do men and women differ and 

2375
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:20,870
the answer is yeah,
it turns out they do.

2376
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:22,153
There's quite a few differences,
but the biggest ones are women are more 

2377
01:53:24,501 --> 01:53:26,000
agreeable because that's one of the 
traits,

2378
01:53:26,001 --> 01:53:26,834
agreeableness and it's the compassion 
politeness dimension and they're more 

2379
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:33,080
prone to negative emotion,
anxiety and emotional pain.

2380
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,213
And that mirrors the psychiatric 
literature that shows worldwide that 

2381
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:39,830
women are more likely to be diagnosed 
with depression and anxiety,

2382
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:43,580
just like men are more likely to be 
imprisoned for antisocial behavior,

2383
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,490
which is the reflection of low 
agreeable.

2384
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:48,350
This is true worldwide.
Okay?

2385
01:53:48,351 --> 01:53:49,184
So there's no evidence of any bias 
unless you say everything is biased 

2386
01:53:51,741 --> 01:53:54,200
everywhere in the world.
Fine could be.

2387
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:58,850
But we've also controlled for that.
So now there are personality differences

2388
01:53:58,851 --> 01:53:59,684
between men and women.
Now the first thing we might point out 

2389
01:54:01,071 --> 01:54:02,540
is they're not that big.

2390
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:07,040
So if you draw a random woman and a 
random man out of the population and you

2391
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:09,830
had to bet on who was most aggressive,
least agreeable,

2392
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:13,730
and you bet on the woman you'd be right 
40 percent of the time,

2393
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,670
which is actually quite a lot.
You'd be right quite a lot.

2394
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:21,110
But if you take the one in a hundred 
person who's most aggressive,

2395
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:25,520
least agreeable,
there's an overwhelming probability that

2396
01:54:25,521 --> 01:54:29,240
there'll be mailed because the 
differences get more extreme at the,

2397
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,690
at the ends of the distribution,
people don't understand the statistics.

2398
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:33,823
you can have two populations that are 
quite similar and still have radically 

2399
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:39,530
dissimilar outcomes if only the extremes
matter.

2400
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:44,150
So like who are the most powerful 
physical fighters in the world?

2401
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,390
Men,
all of them.

2402
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:48,793
what does that mean?
That there are no women who can beat a 

2403
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:51,980
man in a fight?
No,

2404
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:53,990
it also doesn't mean that there are.

2405
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:56,570
There's plenty of women who are more 
aggressive than men,

2406
01:54:56,900 --> 01:55:00,470
but if you take the most aggressive,
physically powerful people,

2407
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:01,693
they're all men,
all of them because they're like one in 

2408
01:55:03,421 --> 01:55:05,900
a thousand people or one in 10,000
people.

2409
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,660
So you can have walloping differences at
the extremes,

2410
01:55:08,661 --> 01:55:10,970
despite most most similarity at the 
middle.

2411
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:13,520
People don't understand that,
but then the next thing is,

2412
01:55:13,521 --> 01:55:14,354
okay,
well there are differences between men 

2413
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:18,050
and women personality wise,
apart from the biological ones.

2414
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:21,770
Are those caused by cultural 
differences?

2415
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:24,110
Hey,
turns out we can answer that.

2416
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:25,063
How rank order countries by how 
egalitarianism their social policies 

2417
01:55:29,871 --> 01:55:31,730
are.
Does everyone agree?

2418
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:32,653
Yeah.
Yeah.

2419
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:35,990
The scandinavians are at the top.
Everyone agrees,

2420
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:36,831
left,
right?

2421
01:55:36,831 --> 01:55:38,150
Doesn't matter.
Everyone agrees.

2422
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:39,171
It's like,
okay,

2423
01:55:39,171 --> 01:55:42,800
so you stack up the cultures by how 
egalitarianism social policies are,

2424
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:47,310
and then you look to see how big the 
differences are between men and women up

2425
01:55:47,311 --> 01:55:49,140
that hierarchy of egalitarianism.

2426
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:52,620
And if as the societies become more 
egalitarian,

2427
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,560
the differences between men and women 
disappear,

2428
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:59,760
then it's sociocultural.
That isn't what happened.

2429
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:04,970
What happened was is that as the has got
more egalitarian,

2430
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,710
the differences between men and women 
got bigger,

2431
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:08,783
not smaller.
It means the sociocultural construct 

2432
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:13,110
people,
and I'm talking to you,

2433
01:56:13,111 --> 01:56:15,930
sociocultural construct people,
you're wrong.

2434
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,130
You're wrong.
You make the society's more egalitarian.

2435
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:21,113
Men and women get more different.
Who makes the argument in opposition of 

2436
01:56:23,911 --> 01:56:24,631
this,
all the,

2437
01:56:24,631 --> 01:56:25,464
all of the social constructionist,
all the radical left wingers and what 

2438
01:56:27,421 --> 01:56:29,250
are the uses fat.
They don't have facts,

2439
01:56:29,251 --> 01:56:31,320
but then they criticize the whole idea 
of facts.

2440
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:33,480
Then they go after the whole idea of 
science as a,

2441
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:36,690
as a,
as a western patriarchal construct.

2442
01:56:36,691 --> 01:56:37,524
What's their motivation?
The motivation is that if people are 

2443
01:56:40,591 --> 01:56:43,050
different than the equality of outcome,
isn't,

2444
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:46,950
is neither desirable nor achievable and 
why do they want equality of outcome?

2445
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:49,490
Why is this so?
That's a good question.

2446
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:50,433
Well,
part of it is part of it is actual 

2447
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:52,900
compassion.
Look around.

2448
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:58,410
It's not good that some people lose and 
it's certainly not good that some losers

2449
01:56:58,561 --> 01:57:00,570
lose all the time.
Who wants that?

2450
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,940
You happy when you walk down the street 
and see homeless people.

2451
01:57:02,990 --> 01:57:03,541
It's like,
hey,

2452
01:57:03,541 --> 01:57:04,890
look,
the hierarchies working.

2453
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:07,770
Look at these homeless people.
No one's happy about that.

2454
01:57:07,850 --> 01:57:08,611
right?
Right.

2455
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:09,444
Okay.
So the fact of failure within a 

2456
01:57:11,161 --> 01:57:15,510
hierarchy of value is painful.
And so to give the devil his due,

2457
01:57:15,511 --> 01:57:17,150
you give the left.
It's due just like you.

2458
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:19,200
You do the right is like,
yeah,

2459
01:57:19,201 --> 01:57:21,510
it's painful.
That hierarchies produced dispossession.

2460
01:57:21,690 --> 01:57:22,830
Bloody right.
Okay.

2461
01:57:22,831 --> 01:57:24,720
What's the cure?
Get rid of the hierarchy.

2462
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:26,040
Hey,
well wait a minute,

2463
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:27,630
man.
You get rid of the hierarchy.

2464
01:57:27,631 --> 01:57:28,464
You get rid of the value structure.
You get rid of the tools that allow us 

2465
01:57:30,871 --> 01:57:33,900
to generate absolute wealth and stop 
people from starving.

2466
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:35,550
It's a catastrophe.
Okay,

2467
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:36,310
so.
So there's.

2468
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:37,830
There's the problem.
You have to have the hierarchy,

2469
01:57:37,831 --> 01:57:40,920
but then also it isn't just compassion 
on the left.

2470
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:44,100
It's envy.
It's like,

2471
01:57:44,101 --> 01:57:45,840
okay,
if I'm.

2472
01:57:45,841 --> 01:57:46,674
So if I'm standing for the dispossessed,
what makes me so sure that I'm not just 

2473
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:51,594
standing against the successful and 
maybe that's because I'm bitter and 

2474
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:58,110
jealous and envious and resentful and 
certainly it's highly probable.

2475
01:57:58,111 --> 01:57:58,944
If you look at what happened in the 
leftist societies that tried to pursue 

2476
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:05,070
utopia and you don't read envy and 
resentment into that,

2477
01:58:05,071 --> 01:58:05,904
you're not.
You don't know the history because 

2478
01:58:06,901 --> 01:58:09,390
that's clearly the why else did they 
become murderous,

2479
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:13,950
but this is the question like it's 
clearly the case that the soviet union,

2480
01:58:13,951 --> 01:58:17,400
for example,
was motivated by the desire for equality

2481
01:58:17,401 --> 01:58:20,490
of outcome as a primary motivation.
What happened?

2482
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:23,370
Twenty 5 million people were killed.
Why?

2483
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:24,863
Why?
What was it all compassion and love for 

2484
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,374
the dispossessed or was it absolutely 
bitter resentment and hatred for anyone 

2485
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:37,140
who had any shred of success whatsoever 
on any possible dimension of evaluation.

2486
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:38,243
so this compassion for people that 
aren't doing well when utilized the 

2487
01:58:43,331 --> 01:58:44,164
wrong way or when approached the wrong 
way leads to attacking people that do 

2488
01:58:49,121 --> 01:58:51,460
well.
The danger of compassion.

2489
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,360
That's exactly.
Well,

2490
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:54,460
look what happens if you get beat,
you think,

2491
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:55,323
oh,
look at how isn't it lovely that the 

2492
01:58:56,351 --> 01:58:58,270
mother,
grizzly bear takes care of her cubs?

2493
01:58:58,750 --> 01:58:59,583
Yeah,
it's lovely bad until you get between 

2494
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:03,850
her and her cubs and it's not so damn 
lovely,

2495
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:06,850
and that's the flip side of that 
affiliate of agreeableness.

2496
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:10,300
It's like if you,
if you're on my side,

2497
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:11,373
you know,
if you're the infant who's sheltering 

2498
01:59:13,091 --> 01:59:14,680
under my wings,
it's like I am.

2499
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:18,580
I'm the absolute epitome of of maternal 
love and care,

2500
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,800
but if I have identified you as a 
predator,

2501
01:59:21,010 --> 01:59:21,843
you better look the hell out and that's 
playing out in our political landscape 

2502
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:26,050
at a very,
very rapid rate.

2503
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:29,260
That's the female side of 
totalitarianism as far as I can tell,

2504
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:32,380
the feminine side of totalitarianism.
It's not just that.

2505
01:59:32,381 --> 01:59:33,214
It's not just that agreeableness 
motivates aggression because it 

2506
01:59:35,621 --> 01:59:40,120
certainly does.
it's also that it's that the envious and

2507
01:59:40,121 --> 01:59:45,121
the resentful can use compassion as a,
as a camouflage for their true intent,

2508
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:48,430
which is to tear down anyone who has 
more than them.

2509
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:49,593
That's the why you noticed like when 
there's discussions about the one 

2510
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:54,190
percent we already talked about this.
Well,

2511
01:59:54,191 --> 01:59:56,140
who's the one percent?
While it's.

2512
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:57,310
I'm a,
I'm a.

2513
01:59:57,370 --> 01:59:58,970
I'm in.
I'm in the,

2514
01:59:59,030 --> 01:59:59,863
in the park in New York,
demonstrating against wall street down 

2515
02:00:02,561 --> 02:00:03,790
with the one percent.
It's like,

2516
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:06,550
wait a second,
you're in the one percent.

2517
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:07,720
They are mr.
Protester.

2518
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,200
No,
no.

2519
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:13,200
You don't understand the rich are those 
who have more money than me guess,

2520
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:14,770
right?
That's the definition.

2521
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,720
Who's rich?
Someone who has more than me,

2522
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:17,913
not me.

2523
02:00:18,330 --> 02:00:19,151
It's like,
well,

2524
02:00:19,151 --> 02:00:21,820
why?
Why isn't the one percent north America?

2525
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:24,700
Why not?
Because it's inconvenient.

2526
02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:28,510
That's an inconvenient fact,
so that's part of it,

2527
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:31,480
but there's the.
The envy and resentment.

2528
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:32,523
This is the real pathological end of the
full compassion that motivates the 

2529
02:00:36,611 --> 02:00:37,720
radical left.
It's like,

2530
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:39,100
yeah,
you liked the poor.

2531
02:00:39,101 --> 02:00:41,410
Do you?
What makes you think you just don't hate

2532
02:00:41,411 --> 02:00:44,500
the successful?
Now it's a question.

2533
02:00:44,501 --> 02:00:46,060
It's like because you're not perfect,
man.

2534
02:00:46,061 --> 02:00:49,540
There's hatred in you and the 
probability that it's more powerful than

2535
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,880
love is pretty damn high.
So,

2536
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:56,860
so look to your own,
look to your own viewpoint before you go

2537
02:00:56,861 --> 02:00:58,990
out there and try to fix the hierarchies
of the world,

2538
02:00:59,110 --> 02:01:03,370
just exactly what it is and it's worse 
like look in the russian revolution,

2539
02:01:03,371 --> 02:01:05,560
for example,
let's say just for the sake of argument,

2540
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:10,120
that the first rung of revolutionaries 
were only driven by compassion.

2541
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:13,570
Maybe they were.
They all got killed.

2542
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:15,333
they got killed by the people who came 
after and they weren't so interested in 

2543
02:01:17,231 --> 02:01:18,064
compassionate at all.
They were interested in ferreting out 

2544
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:24,960
everyone who had a modicum of success on
any dimension and doing them in and that

2545
02:01:25,181 --> 02:01:30,181
happened in wave after bloody wave.
They killed all the successful farmers.

2546
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:33,930
Those were the kulaks.
It killed all of the running up,

2547
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:35,260
killed him,
rape them,

2548
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:37,920
stolen property,
sent the remnants to siberia,

2549
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:40,160
froze them to death 10 years later,

2550
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:43,040
6 million ukrainians dot because they 
couldn't raise crops.

2551
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:50,020
Why do you think that people are so 
opposed to discussing these things or to

2552
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:51,044
challenging cultural norms?
Because one of the things that I've 

2553
02:01:54,170 --> 02:01:55,003
seen,
especially in terms of the differences 

2554
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:59,640
between men and women,
this,

2555
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:04,890
this reaction to some of the things that
you've said has been very.

2556
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:08,053
It's very strange to me.
It's very strange that people aren't 

2557
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:14,520
recognizing that these are unbalanced 
approaches and that there's.

2558
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:17,280
Well,
some of it's just complicated joe.

2559
02:02:17,281 --> 02:02:17,851
It's like,
well,

2560
02:02:17,851 --> 02:02:19,800
let's say there are differences between 
men and women.

2561
02:02:19,801 --> 02:02:20,634
Just for the sake of argument.
The biggest differences seem to be an 

2562
02:02:22,291 --> 02:02:24,900
interest by the way,
and so what's going to happen is that if

2563
02:02:24,901 --> 02:02:26,640
we let men and women's sort themselves 
out,

2564
02:02:26,970 --> 02:02:27,803
there aren't going to be very many 
female engineers and tech types and 

2565
02:02:29,641 --> 02:02:31,380
there's going to be a lot of female 
nurses.

2566
02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:33,930
There's not going to be many male nurses
and healthcare types.

2567
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:37,050
There's not going to be met very many 
male elementary school teachers.

2568
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:38,370
But Is this bad?
Well,

2569
02:02:38,371 --> 02:02:39,870
that's the question.
Who knows?

2570
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:41,670
do we know?
I don't know.

2571
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:44,810
Well,
the idea of having

2572
02:02:44,910 --> 02:02:48,540
unequal society where gender inequality 
is completely knocked down,

2573
02:02:48,541 --> 02:02:50,480
gender pay gap is nonexistent.

2574
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:51,353
Yeah.
Well that's a problem because that's 

2575
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:53,800
quality of outcome.
It's also,

2576
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:56,790
it's the quality of outcome thing is a 
nonstarter.

2577
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:58,103
Whether it's okay with like if men and 
women sort themselves into different 

2578
02:03:01,021 --> 02:03:03,060
occupations,
which looks highly probable.

2579
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:06,420
I don't know if that's okay.
And then it's also like,

2580
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:08,490
okay,
compared to to what alternative?

2581
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:11,940
Like you should every elementary school 
teacher be female,

2582
02:03:12,330 --> 02:03:15,240
should every psychologist be female?
Because that's what's happening.

2583
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:18,010
And the answer to that is,
well I don't know but.

2584
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:19,350
But there's another answer,
which is,

2585
02:03:20,130 --> 02:03:22,770
well,
what do you propose as an alternative to

2586
02:03:22,771 --> 02:03:27,300
free choice that isn't going to cause 
more trouble than free choice?

2587
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:28,231
Because I would say,
well,

2588
02:03:28,231 --> 02:03:30,240
okay,
let's say I'm a feminist for the sake of

2589
02:03:30,241 --> 02:03:31,530
argument,
right?

2590
02:03:31,531 --> 02:03:33,780
So I think while there are differences 
between men and women,

2591
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:37,770
there are actual differences and so some
of those are biological,

2592
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,350
some of them are,
are,

2593
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:40,403
are strategic in some sense because 
women pay a bigger price for 

2594
02:03:43,531 --> 02:03:46,200
reproduction and so that's going to lead
them to make different choices.

2595
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,810
That's just rational based on 
rationality,

2596
02:03:48,811 --> 02:03:51,630
based on biological differences.
So it's like a second order.

2597
02:03:51,631 --> 02:03:52,464
Biological difference.
There's differences in temperament and 

2598
02:03:54,271 --> 02:03:55,350
interest.
They're going,

2599
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:57,090
it's going to lead them to make 
different choices.

2600
02:03:57,540 --> 02:04:00,240
Is that a pro feminist stance or an anti
feminist stance?

2601
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:01,403
It's only antifeminist if you assume 
everyone has to be exactly the same and 

2602
02:04:03,841 --> 02:04:05,460
the outcomes have to be exactly the 
same.

2603
02:04:06,210 --> 02:04:07,800
if the.
If your goal is no,

2604
02:04:07,801 --> 02:04:10,860
leave people the hell alone as much as 
possible.

2605
02:04:10,861 --> 02:04:13,650
Let them make their own informed and 
free choices.

2606
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,740
Then you let the differences manifest 
themselves in the world.

2607
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:19,770
And you take your,
you take your knocks because of that.

2608
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:22,950
The problem with that is this narrative 
of equality,

2609
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,570
the equality of outcome.
Yeah.

2610
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:25,453
It's just equality of human beings.
Just looking at people as we're all 

2611
02:04:28,411 --> 02:04:30,210
equal,
we're not just.

2612
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:33,960
Some people are different.
Things were equal in terms of our rights

2613
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:35,980
or equal in terms of the way we should 
treat each other.

2614
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:37,620
metaphysically equal,
yes,

2615
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:39,750
right?
But on every other dimension,

2616
02:04:39,751 --> 02:04:42,270
we're radically unequal and there's pain
in that.

2617
02:04:42,271 --> 02:04:43,104
That's the.
That's the.

2618
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:46,680
That's the problem is the pain in that 
is real.

2619
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:51,750
The only thing that's worse than the 
pain of inequality is the pain of forced

2620
02:04:51,751 --> 02:04:54,630
equality.
And I'm not being fascinated about that.

2621
02:04:54,631 --> 02:04:55,530
It's like,
look,

2622
02:04:55,531 --> 02:04:58,400
I see the.
The iq issue is,

2623
02:04:58,480 --> 02:04:59,520
is the killer one.
For me,

2624
02:04:59,521 --> 02:05:00,354
it's like,
look,

2625
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:01,373
if you have an iq of less than 83,
you can't be inducted into the american 

2626
02:05:04,081 --> 02:05:05,940
military by law.
Why?

2627
02:05:06,330 --> 02:05:07,163
Because there isn't a damn thing you can
do that isn't counterproductive despite 

2628
02:05:09,451 --> 02:05:12,150
the fact that the army wants you because
they can't get enough manpower.

2629
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,310
That's what they decided.
It's like,

2630
02:05:14,311 --> 02:05:15,144
okay,
so you're on the low end of the 

2631
02:05:15,871 --> 02:05:18,150
cognitive distribution,
what are you going to do?

2632
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:21,120
Not much,
and it's going to get worse.

2633
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:23,370
Is that good?
It's not good.

2634
02:05:23,430 --> 02:05:25,320
It's horrible.
Do we know what to do about it?

2635
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,090
No.
Right.

2636
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:31,410
And we can have equality of outcome 
amongst people with lower than 83 iq.

2637
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:33,660
No one's,
no one's advocating for that.

2638
02:05:33,670 --> 02:05:34,890
No one's asking for that.
Well,

2639
02:05:34,891 --> 02:05:35,641
people will say,
well,

2640
02:05:35,641 --> 02:05:37,380
the iq tests aren't valid.
It's like,

2641
02:05:37,381 --> 02:05:39,150
well,
yeah,

2642
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:40,463
one of the conversations that you have 
that I found to be shocking and it 

2643
02:05:43,891 --> 02:05:47,280
started a trend of misquoting and 
misrepresenting you was uh,

2644
02:05:47,281 --> 02:05:48,114
you did an article,
an interview with vice and they use a 

2645
02:05:51,121 --> 02:05:51,954
snippet of one of the things you said 
and tried to pretend that you had made 

2646
02:05:55,141 --> 02:05:58,690
these very curt statements.
And one of them while he was,

2647
02:05:58,890 --> 02:05:59,723
he was annoying.
So I got kind of curt and that was 

2648
02:06:00,991 --> 02:06:04,110
probably my strategic error makeup.
Is that the one you're talking about?

2649
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:07,390
Makeup and the way people dress,
you know,

2650
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:10,200
while I was trying to draw a lot,
first of all,

2651
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:11,063
how is he annoying?

2652
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:15,140
He knew everything,
he knew everything well.

2653
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:17,160
It was just in his attitude,
you know,

2654
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:19,290
it was challenging you.
He wanted.

2655
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:22,080
he wanted this from the very beginning.
This was him.

2656
02:06:22,830 --> 02:06:24,690
Arms crossed,
eyes up.

2657
02:06:24,691 --> 02:06:25,524
It's like a,
I know more than you and be your 

2658
02:06:27,601 --> 02:06:28,434
probably that reprehensible person that 
I've thought about and this side job to 

2659
02:06:30,511 --> 02:06:33,780
reveal you.
He was signaling he's left leaning.

2660
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:34,883
He was deciding that what you were doing
was representing the patriarchy or you 

2661
02:06:38,181 --> 02:06:39,014
were representing male dominant 
structures that he was saying that are 

2662
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:45,520
not correct.
Yeah.

2663
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:46,413
Well it wasn't accurate assessment,
but it wasn't even that it was left 

2664
02:06:48,871 --> 02:06:49,704
leaning.
I've talked to reasonable left leaning 

2665
02:06:50,941 --> 02:06:53,150
people.
It was built right into his attitude.

2666
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,260
So it made me a little test here that I 
might have been,

2667
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:57,370
which was my strategic error and you 
know,

2668
02:06:57,371 --> 02:06:58,204
you asked earlier,
well why do I get pilloried with some 

2669
02:06:59,941 --> 02:07:00,450
regular?

2670
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:02,820
And some of it is probably my own 
inadequacy.

2671
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:04,650
You know,
it's not,

2672
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:09,180
it isn't that I've handled all the 
opportunities that I've had perfectly,

2673
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:11,430
you know,
and I can get hot under the collar.

2674
02:07:11,431 --> 02:07:12,264
It's a mistake.
It's a mistake because the right 

2675
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:15,323
approach in these situations is to use 
minimal necessary force and to allow 

2676
02:07:18,391 --> 02:07:19,224
myself to get irritated,
let's say even minorly when I'm faced 

2677
02:07:23,491 --> 02:07:26,040
with someone who's doing this is not 
productive,

2678
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:26,993
it doesn't work well,
and so I really need to keep that under 

2679
02:07:28,621 --> 02:07:30,400
control and when I do keep it under 
control,

2680
02:07:30,401 --> 02:07:33,240
it works better.
The makeup one was particularly annoying

2681
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:35,530
to me because I think it's a valid 
conversation.

2682
02:07:35,531 --> 02:07:37,710
It's an interesting conversation.
I said,

2683
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:39,670
and they didn't put this in their 
initial cut.

2684
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:40,504
I said,
I'm not saying that women shouldn't be 

2685
02:07:42,971 --> 02:07:46,720
allowed to wear makeup in the workplace.
I said that explicitly.

2686
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:47,613
Well,
that was why people were so angry when 

2687
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:51,760
they saw the full version of it.
I mean the full version was released.

2688
02:07:51,761 --> 02:07:53,410
Someone leaked it,
right.

2689
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:54,513
Someone who felt like you were being 
misrepresented and that the editing was 

2690
02:07:57,221 --> 02:07:58,054
unjust,
decided to release it and people were 

2691
02:08:00,311 --> 02:08:02,140
absolutely furious.
Yeah.

2692
02:08:02,141 --> 02:08:02,770
Well,
I think the.

2693
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:05,020
I think the vice people actually 
released it,

2694
02:08:05,021 --> 02:08:09,130
but other people took the full release 
and clipped it with the clip release and

2695
02:08:09,131 --> 02:08:12,940
showed how it was being misrepresented,
but so okay,

2696
02:08:12,941 --> 02:08:15,490
so the the makeup thing,
it's like,

2697
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:16,180
all right,
look,

2698
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:17,560
here's the.
first of all,

2699
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,053
I make a mistake sometimes in treating 
journalists like I would treat my 

2700
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:22,234
graduate students,
so when I'm having a conversation with 

2701
02:08:24,341 --> 02:08:25,360
my students and we say,
well,

2702
02:08:25,361 --> 02:08:27,310
here's the problem.
It's an intellectual exercise,

2703
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:29,680
sexual,
sexual behavior.

2704
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:30,573
How do we regulate?
What are the norms around sexual 

2705
02:08:32,891 --> 02:08:33,820
behavior in the workplace?

2706
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:38,080
It's not the question.
It's a question we don't know.

2707
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:39,910
Okay.
Here's a bunch of possibilities.

2708
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:41,410
Possible rules,
right?

2709
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:42,850
No flirting,
no hugging,

2710
02:08:42,851 --> 02:08:44,710
no eye contact for more than five 
seconds.

2711
02:08:44,711 --> 02:08:45,700
That's netflix,
right?

2712
02:08:46,030 --> 02:08:48,190
No hugging,
no damn right.

2713
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:50,500
They have no eye contact for more than 
five seconds.

2714
02:08:50,501 --> 02:08:51,940
That's holy shit.
Nbc,

2715
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:54,130
no hugging.
That's real.

2716
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:55,560
It's real.
Fuck.

2717
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:56,913
What if you're having a conversation 
with a woman who's your boss and she's 

2718
02:09:00,071 --> 02:09:03,250
asking you questions about things.
Can You look down every five seconds?

2719
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:05,190
Fucking christ.
Is that real?

2720
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:06,220
Yes.
It's real.

2721
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:08,350
It's real.
So bad.

2722
02:09:08,351 --> 02:09:10,190
That's such a terrible idea.
Yes,

2723
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:11,370
it's.
Yeah,

2724
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:12,213
it's a terrible idea,
but there's a lot of women that I'm 

2725
02:09:13,691 --> 02:09:17,380
friends with that I've never had any 
sexual interest at all,

2726
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:19,780
and we looked at each other in the eye.
That's what you say,

2727
02:09:19,781 --> 02:09:22,360
but you're a potential rapist.
Manifestation.

2728
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:23,720
Yes.
Picture,

2729
02:09:24,030 --> 02:09:24,340
yes.

2730
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:25,420
You get the whole picture.
So.

2731
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:27,340
So if you have a discussion,
you say,

2732
02:09:27,341 --> 02:09:28,174
well look,
what are the rules governing sexual 

2733
02:09:29,561 --> 02:09:30,820
behavior in the workplace?
OkAy.

2734
02:09:30,821 --> 02:09:34,840
Can you come to work at a negligee no.
How about boxers?

2735
02:09:34,841 --> 02:09:36,190
If you're a mat?
No.

2736
02:09:36,370 --> 02:09:38,320
Okay.
So there's some short skirt.

2737
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:40,240
Well that.
This is the thing,

2738
02:09:40,241 --> 02:09:42,150
the devil's in the bloody details,
right?

2739
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:43,150
It's like,
okay,

2740
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:47,350
we can't come to work naked.
You can't come to work in boxer shorts.

2741
02:09:47,351 --> 02:09:49,750
You can come to work in a suit.
Okay,

2742
02:09:49,751 --> 02:09:53,620
so the line is somewhere between boxers 
and suit.

2743
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:57,880
Where exactly is the line?
Exactly.

2744
02:09:57,940 --> 02:10:02,890
Can wear shorts while that can't.
Why can a woman wear a dress?

2745
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:06,580
The way that men in professional 
organizations,

2746
02:10:06,581 --> 02:10:07,414
the way that men solve this problem was 
that everyone wore a uniform and a 

2747
02:10:11,981 --> 02:10:12,814
uniform makes you uniform.
That's why you wear it and the uniform 

2748
02:10:16,481 --> 02:10:20,620
is the suit and it's a derivation of a 
military military garb,

2749
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,210
and so the Idea was,
well,

2750
02:10:22,211 --> 02:10:26,570
we want to get rid of excess diversity,
right?

2751
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:30,130
In clothing where your damn suit.
Then we know you're playing the game and

2752
02:10:30,131 --> 02:10:32,200
we don't have to be distracted by what 
you're wearing.

2753
02:10:32,510 --> 02:10:33,710
Okay,
so what men did.

2754
02:10:33,711 --> 02:10:35,420
Okay,
so now women come into the workspace.

2755
02:10:35,421 --> 02:10:36,230
It's like,
hmm,

2756
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:39,320
what do they do while there's business 
professional dress.

2757
02:10:39,321 --> 02:10:41,180
Right?
And there's some rules around that,

2758
02:10:41,181 --> 02:10:42,590
but.
But what are the rules?

2759
02:10:42,591 --> 02:10:44,030
Exactly.
Exactly.

2760
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:45,470
And I was thinking,
well,

2761
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:47,960
we're worried about sexual misbehavior 
in the workplace.

2762
02:10:47,961 --> 02:10:49,790
You can't look at someone for more than 
five seconds.

2763
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:51,350
You can't give them a hug.
Okay,

2764
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:54,110
what about makeup?
Do we have a discussion about makeup?

2765
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:55,041
oh,
well no,

2766
02:10:55,041 --> 02:10:56,870
we can't have a discussion about that.
It's like,

2767
02:10:57,110 --> 02:10:58,730
well,
let's make up sexual signaling.

2768
02:10:59,030 --> 02:11:00,350
It's like,
well,

2769
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:03,170
if you're an fear,
an evolutionary biologist,

2770
02:11:03,171 --> 02:11:06,860
the question is makeup sexual signaling,
that's not even a question.

2771
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:09,080
It's like awful.
Obviously that's what it is.

2772
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:09,973
That's why the conversation was 
frustrating because he was saying 

2773
02:11:11,961 --> 02:11:13,940
because they want to do it,
they want to wear it,

2774
02:11:13,970 --> 02:11:16,750
they want to look good while and maybe 
does that even mean well?

2775
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:17,790
That's right.
That's right.

2776
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:20,230
That's right.
What does that mean?

2777
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:22,370
Well,
everyone knows what that means.

2778
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:24,170
He has to say that.
No,

2779
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:28,310
he has to say that because in his tribe 
you have to communicate that way.

2780
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,910
He,
oh wait,

2781
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:32,870
women wear makeup because they want to 
look good,

2782
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:33,783
but what do you mean do that?
Because that's his take or because he's 

2783
02:11:37,791 --> 02:11:40,310
trying to rile you up,
but you're getting riled up right now.

2784
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:41,203
Both as a journalist.
It's kind of his idea or his job to 

2785
02:11:44,181 --> 02:11:45,014
challenge you in some way and it it the 
very least offer the devil's advocate 

2786
02:11:48,501 --> 02:11:49,790
opinion.
Sure.

2787
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:53,210
Explain yourself better.
Why shouldn't they wear makeup?

2788
02:11:53,211 --> 02:11:54,080
They just want to look good.

2789
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:57,440
You need to explain yourself better.
Why you saying he did it was like,

2790
02:11:57,470 --> 02:11:58,460
oh,
Dr.

2791
02:11:58,460 --> 02:11:59,293
Peterson.
It's obvious what it means for them to 

2792
02:12:00,081 --> 02:12:02,060
look good.
Like everyone knows that.

2793
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:02,894
Do you think that.
Why don't know it like perhaps like he 

2794
02:12:04,641 --> 02:12:08,780
was intellectually sparring with you and
he was being aggressive about it.

2795
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:11,810
I think he felt.
I think he felt that.

2796
02:12:11,811 --> 02:12:15,530
I think he felt that it was necessary to
challenge me that that was his role as a

2797
02:12:15,531 --> 02:12:18,050
journalist,
but fundamentally he was smug.

2798
02:12:18,290 --> 02:12:22,070
He thought he came at the entire 
conversation with an air of intellectual

2799
02:12:22,071 --> 02:12:22,904
condescension.
It was built right into the discussion 

2800
02:12:24,651 --> 02:12:26,440
right from the beginning and he never 
dropped it at all.

2801
02:12:26,441 --> 02:12:27,201
It's like,
well,

2802
02:12:27,201 --> 02:12:28,034
I know what you're doing and I know 
what's up and I know how to take you 

2803
02:12:30,651 --> 02:12:31,484
apart and I know that whatever you're 
talking about is just an attempt to 

2804
02:12:33,861 --> 02:12:35,580
defend your how long indians?

2805
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:37,460
Oh god.
About an hour.

2806
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:40,850
Something like that.
How much did they use owing the clips?

2807
02:12:40,851 --> 02:12:42,680
Hardly any of it.
I don't even know.

2808
02:12:42,681 --> 02:12:45,770
a couple of minutes.
So yeah.

2809
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,083
Yeah.
So your tendency to get riled up can be 

2810
02:12:49,521 --> 02:12:50,990
exploited?
Yes,

2811
02:12:50,991 --> 02:12:51,780
of course.
And it's,

2812
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:52,420
it's,
it's,

2813
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:56,360
it's the problem of deviating from the 
doctrine of minimal necessary force,

2814
02:12:56,361 --> 02:12:57,194
like the best times.
The best interactions I've had with 

2815
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:03,410
contentious journalists is where I've 
absolutely kept my cool,

2816
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:05,960
you know,
but kathy newman.

2817
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:06,980
Yes,
exactly.

2818
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:09,380
Exactly.
So what you're saying is,

2819
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:11,890
well that's what he was like,
yeah.

2820
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:14,330
It's like I know who you are and I know 
you're covering it up.

2821
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:15,890
It's like,
well,

2822
02:13:15,891 --> 02:13:19,490
it's these con,
these concepts.

2823
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,443
These are complex situations.
When you find men and women who are 

2824
02:13:23,781 --> 02:13:27,080
sexually attracted to each other and 
they're working in confined environments

2825
02:13:27,081 --> 02:13:27,914
for long periods of time and they 
essentially spend more time with the 

2826
02:13:30,201 --> 02:13:31,034
people they work with and do what their 
lovers and their wives and their 

2827
02:13:32,521 --> 02:13:34,830
husbands and it's weird,
you know,

2828
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:38,610
men and women interact with each other 
and closed in boxes is weird.

2829
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:40,770
That's what an office is.
Closed inbox.

2830
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,833
They're all together and if they find 
each other attractive and they're 

2831
02:13:44,041 --> 02:13:44,874
interacting with each other socially,
especially if there's any interaction 

2832
02:13:47,971 --> 02:13:50,880
that deviates outside of work 
discussion,

2833
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:52,380
they start talking about different 
things.

2834
02:13:52,381 --> 02:13:56,620
You also don't want them to find each 
other unattractive take.

2835
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:59,370
If you're taking someone out for dinner 
on a business dinner,

2836
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:02,400
it's like even if it's guys going out 
together,

2837
02:14:02,401 --> 02:14:03,234
let's say,
it's not like they're working to find 

2838
02:14:05,461 --> 02:14:07,920
each other unattractive and I don't mean
sexually.

2839
02:14:07,921 --> 02:14:10,160
There's you want to manifest yourself as
wine,

2840
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:11,053
enjoy each other's company and you want 
to be charismatic and you want to be 

2841
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:16,810
witty and all of those things and that 
shade.

2842
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:18,540
Especially when you,
when you add,

2843
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,553
assuming a heterosexual environment,
you add a heterosexual component to 

2844
02:14:22,501 --> 02:14:24,720
that.
The borders become fuzzy.

2845
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:27,150
And so I was talking about border 
conditions.

2846
02:14:27,210 --> 02:14:28,950
So if we're going to have a conversation
about this,

2847
02:14:28,951 --> 02:14:31,140
let's talk about the border conditions.
Oh no,

2848
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:31,974
we can't do that.
It's like black on the discussion you 

2849
02:14:34,171 --> 02:14:35,004
guys wanted.
Why do you continue to agree to have 

2850
02:14:36,661 --> 02:14:38,280
these conversations that are going to be
edited?

2851
02:14:38,850 --> 02:14:41,040
Oh,
well that's a good question.

2852
02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:44,220
The jim jefferies one was another one.
Jim's a friend of mine,

2853
02:14:44,490 --> 02:14:47,490
but I mean he gave you a good question 
and you actually gave a good answer.

2854
02:14:47,491 --> 02:14:49,020
You said,
actually,

2855
02:14:49,021 --> 02:14:49,854
I'm probably wrong about that.
You were talking about whether or not 

2856
02:14:52,651 --> 02:14:53,920
gay people,
uh,

2857
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:56,670
should,
whether someone should be forced to bake

2858
02:14:56,671 --> 02:14:59,940
a cake for cake for gay people.
And you said forced to probably not.

2859
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:00,571
And they said,
well,

2860
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:03,150
what if they don't want to bake a cake 
for black people?

2861
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:05,460
And he said,
well actually,

2862
02:15:05,461 --> 02:15:07,650
probably they probably should be forced 
to.

2863
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:08,100
Yeah.

2864
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:09,240
Well probably wrong.
Yeah.

2865
02:15:09,241 --> 02:15:11,670
Well I was probably wrong in everything 
I did in that,

2866
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:15,930
in that part of the discussion because I
hadn't thought that issue through enough

2867
02:15:15,931 --> 02:15:16,764
to actually give a good answer.
You didn't expect that issue because 

2868
02:15:18,631 --> 02:15:20,580
this is not something you talk about 
commonly know.

2869
02:15:20,581 --> 02:15:22,260
And it's,
it's actually complicated,

2870
02:15:22,261 --> 02:15:24,840
right?
I mean obviously the whole I won't serve

2871
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:26,820
you because you're black thing is not 
good.

2872
02:15:27,090 --> 02:15:27,923
But then again you have,
you also have the right to choose who 

2873
02:15:29,731 --> 02:15:32,520
you're going to affiliate with,
but then that's complicated because it's

2874
02:15:32,521 --> 02:15:35,130
a commercial circumstance and then if 
you're making a cake,

2875
02:15:35,131 --> 02:15:37,620
is that the same as serving or is that 
compelled speech?

2876
02:15:37,621 --> 02:15:39,120
It's like,
oh my god,

2877
02:15:39,270 --> 02:15:41,850
these are border cases that caused a lot
of controversy.

2878
02:15:41,851 --> 02:15:44,790
I don't mean serving black people.
Obviously that's not a border case,

2879
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:45,923
but these cases that caused a lot of 
controversy is where two principals are 

2880
02:15:48,481 --> 02:15:52,320
at odds and it isn't exactly clear where
to draw the line and I'm not happy with,

2881
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:55,230
you know,
I'm not happy with my answer to that,

2882
02:15:55,231 --> 02:15:56,064
but I hadn't spent the week would take 
to think through the issue and really 

2883
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:03,540
have a comprehensive perspective and 
expect that to be a subject anyway.

2884
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:04,200
No,
no.

2885
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:06,060
What.
How long did you talk to jim for?

2886
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:08,940
Oh,
I think about 45 minutes.

2887
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,530
Maybe an hour.
Quite a long time.

2888
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:11,731
Oh,
two minutes.

2889
02:16:11,731 --> 02:16:12,564
Yeah.
Well my daughter has told me and and my 

2890
02:16:14,971 --> 02:16:16,350
wife as well,
my son as well.

2891
02:16:16,351 --> 02:16:19,800
in these discussions we've been thinking
about how to handle the media,

2892
02:16:19,801 --> 02:16:20,634
which has got a very complicated 
question and one hypothesis being don't 

2893
02:16:25,441 --> 02:16:30,130
do interviews that will be edited and 
I've thought about

2894
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:33,670
that and and been thinking about it and 
that might be the right answer.

2895
02:16:33,671 --> 02:16:36,180
It might be the right answer going 
faster and get his as well.

2896
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:37,690
It could.
It could easily be,

2897
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:38,750
although snow

2898
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:42,900
way you can't be misrepresented.
Trust all of the problems that I've seen

2899
02:16:42,901 --> 02:16:45,630
with you,
all of them come from you being edited.

2900
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:46,973
Yes.
I mean there's complex subjects that 

2901
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:49,673
people would disagree with you on,
but when you look at complete miss 

2902
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:53,953
characterizations of your point,
these have been established because of 

2903
02:16:57,391 --> 02:16:58,224
editing?
Yes.

2904
02:16:58,250 --> 02:17:00,560
Well I guess the only counter argument 
is this,

2905
02:17:00,561 --> 02:17:05,540
and I mean a lot of these,
a lot of these opportunities come.

2906
02:17:05,570 --> 02:17:07,950
I've had opportunities that are coming 
at me,

2907
02:17:07,951 --> 02:17:11,840
a rate at a rate that doesn't allow me 
to think them through as much as I could

2908
02:17:11,841 --> 02:17:13,130
optimally,
but,

2909
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:13,993
but then there's another thing which is 
it isn't necessarily a mistake to lay 

2910
02:17:19,611 --> 02:17:20,444
yourself open to attack because 
sometimes it reveals the motives of the 

2911
02:17:25,251 --> 02:17:26,084
attackers.
Like that's what happened in the kathy 

2912
02:17:27,901 --> 02:17:31,540
newman interview now that could have 
gone really sideways.

2913
02:17:31,541 --> 02:17:32,374
Like I was lucky there to some degree 
because she interviewed me for 40 

2914
02:17:35,321 --> 02:17:37,630
minutes or whatever and something like 
that.

2915
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:38,943
And then they did chop it down to seven 
minutes or three minutes and it was 

2916
02:17:42,071 --> 02:17:44,440
exactly what you'd expect and that is 
what I expected.

2917
02:17:44,441 --> 02:17:46,270
After I walked away from the interview,
I thought,

2918
02:17:46,271 --> 02:17:47,104
oh my god,
they're just going to chop this into 

2919
02:17:48,850 --> 02:17:49,683
reprehensible segments and pillory me,
but I walked away from it because there 

2920
02:17:52,721 --> 02:17:53,554
was 50 other things to do,
but then it was so funny because they 

2921
02:17:56,741 --> 02:17:57,574
did do that and then they put up the 
whole interview and the reason they put 

2922
02:18:00,931 --> 02:18:04,380
up the whole interview was because they 
thought the interview went fine.

2923
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:07,540
It isn't that they knew that that was 
going to cause commotion.

2924
02:18:07,541 --> 02:18:08,770
Not at all,
not a bit,

2925
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:10,930
not a bit,
and I know this for a fact,

2926
02:18:11,470 --> 02:18:14,330
so they put up the whole interview and 
then,

2927
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:15,233
well,
what happened was what was actually 

2928
02:18:16,931 --> 02:18:19,090
happening revealed itself,
and that was very,

2929
02:18:19,091 --> 02:18:23,560
very effective.
Now that having that happen meant that I

2930
02:18:23,561 --> 02:18:27,730
had exposed myself to substantial stress
and risk because that was stressful.

2931
02:18:27,731 --> 02:18:28,930
I mean,
first of all,

2932
02:18:28,931 --> 02:18:32,140
there was the interview second 
afterwards I thought,

2933
02:18:32,141 --> 02:18:34,000
oh my god,
I'm going to get pilloried for that.

2934
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:38,170
Then they did release the cut.
Then they released the whole thing.

2935
02:18:38,171 --> 02:18:42,340
Then there was all this response to it 
and then then the newman people who were

2936
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:45,550
absolutely flabbergasted by the negative
response said,

2937
02:18:46,330 --> 02:18:51,330
peterson is unleashed his army of trolls
and poor kathy had to go into hiding.

2938
02:18:51,370 --> 02:18:54,010
It's like there's no evidence of any 
credible threats.

2939
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:54,843
They said they called in the police,
but you can do that Without there being 

2940
02:18:56,771 --> 02:18:58,840
reason.
You can just say that which is what they

2941
02:18:58,841 --> 02:18:59,674
said.
They played a victim narrative 

2942
02:19:00,401 --> 02:19:03,280
instantly.
Although one thing kathy newman is not,

2943
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:07,330
even though she might play it at the 
behest of her employers is a victim.

2944
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:09,610
She's one of the most powerful people in
britain.

2945
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:10,683
She's no victim,
so to play the victim card and a 

2946
02:19:12,511 --> 02:19:14,730
situation like that is absolutely 
reprehensible,

2947
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:18,450
but that's what they did and then like a
dozen newspapers did it and said,

2948
02:19:18,451 --> 02:19:19,284
well,
peterson's trolls are attacking poor 

2949
02:19:20,371 --> 02:19:21,151
kathy,
and I thought,

2950
02:19:21,151 --> 02:19:22,340
oh,
well now I'm screwed.

2951
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:23,273
You don't own your fans.
Did the idea that people that are 

2952
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:28,700
interested in the things that you have 
to say that you have control over them,

2953
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:30,800
like you can give them marching orders

2954
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:34,000
person that does that well,
and how many million,

2955
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:36,550
how many million people did there have 
to be before?

2956
02:19:36,551 --> 02:19:38,510
They're not all trolls.
yeah,

2957
02:19:39,130 --> 02:19:40,660
because that was the real issue there.
It's like,

2958
02:19:40,661 --> 02:19:41,530
okay,
10,000

2959
02:19:41,531 --> 02:19:44,380
people commented on the video trolls.
Okay.

2960
02:19:44,381 --> 02:19:46,450
What about 150,000?
Well,

2961
02:19:46,451 --> 02:19:49,600
what about 10 million?
Well now if you look at the video,

2962
02:19:49,601 --> 02:19:52,540
which is about 10 million plus all the 
clips,

2963
02:19:52,541 --> 02:19:55,240
it's like $50 million.
And the commentS,

2964
02:19:55,241 --> 02:19:56,074
the pro,
the comments that are critical with 

2965
02:19:58,331 --> 02:20:01,390
regards to kathy newman's conduct are 
running about 50 to one.

2966
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:03,100
So that's all trolls.
Is it?

2967
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:04,503
I don't think so.
It's preposterous that narratives you 

2968
02:20:06,841 --> 02:20:07,410
see,
that was,

2969
02:20:07,410 --> 02:20:08,243
that was a good example of taking the,
taking the risk and I'm not saying it's 

2970
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:15,430
justified and I think that it's very,
very stressful,

2971
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:17,420
you know,
but you know,

2972
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:20,180
you take the good,
you take the bad with the good and maybe

2973
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:21,043
maybe it's time for me,
it might be time for me just to 

2974
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:27,230
disappear to some degree altogether.
You worry about being overexposed.

2975
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:28,213
Oh definitely.
I'd be worried about that for a long 

2976
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:31,640
time.

2977
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:33,740
Yeah.
And is there any benefit in that?

2978
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:34,633
Is there any benefit in more exposure?
Are we talking about the same thing we 

2979
02:20:36,861 --> 02:20:41,180
were talking about earlier with regards 
to men working insane hours?

2980
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,433
I mean have you as your message out 
enough that you don't have to do these 

2981
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:49,490
ridiculous interviews maybe instantly,

2982
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:50,320
maybe,
maybe.

2983
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:50,900
Yeah.
Well,

2984
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:54,440
and I don't want to turn it into a 
parody of myself and all of that.

2985
02:20:54,441 --> 02:20:55,274
I mean,
I think and I am trying to handle this 

2986
02:20:57,171 --> 02:20:59,690
and I've got people who are advising.
We were trying to figure it out.

2987
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:06,190
I think that this tour is a good thing.
Yes.

2988
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:08,200
And but that's,
that's very controlled.

2989
02:21:08,420 --> 02:21:11,360
I think we'll so completely unedited.
Yes,

2990
02:21:11,361 --> 02:21:14,030
exactly.
It is long form conversations.

2991
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:15,013
Yes,
and I think that coming on your podcast 

2992
02:21:16,341 --> 02:21:18,350
and talking to ruben on his shows and so
forth,

2993
02:21:18,351 --> 02:21:21,880
I think that's good.
The,

2994
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:23,580
the,
the interaction with the journalist.

2995
02:21:23,581 --> 02:21:24,414
I'm certainly not taking anywhere near 
the number of opportunities that I have 

2996
02:21:27,241 --> 02:21:28,650
in front of me.
Right?

2997
02:21:28,651 --> 02:21:31,050
We are trying to be very careful in 
picking and choosing,

2998
02:21:31,051 --> 02:21:33,620
but that doesn't always go well and it 
it like.

2999
02:21:33,621 --> 02:21:37,680
It could be that,
it could be that I shouldn't do anything

3000
02:21:37,681 --> 02:21:40,350
that is edited at all.
That's certainly possible.

3001
02:21:40,830 --> 02:21:41,663
So.

3002
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,160
Well this is the problem.
You,

3003
02:21:44,161 --> 02:21:44,994
you speak in these,
you speak in these long form podcasts 

3004
02:21:50,201 --> 02:21:51,034
and interviews and you get a chance to 
extrapolate and unpack some pretty 

3005
02:21:56,741 --> 02:22:01,450
complicated issues and compare them to 
other complicated issues and try to find

3006
02:22:01,451 --> 02:22:06,130
meaning in middle ground and try to try 
to eliminate certain positions.

3007
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:11,760
when you expose yourself to editing,
you expose yourself to someone's idea of

3008
02:22:13,181 --> 02:22:14,014
what the narrative should be and how to 
frame your positions in it in and 

3009
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:22,630
dishonest way.
You're seeing it time and time again and

3010
02:22:22,631 --> 02:22:24,830
it exposes the problem with medium look.

3011
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:27,210
I went to the aspen ideas festival last 
week,

3012
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:28,313
which is a whole story in and of itself,
but I was interviewed there by a 

3013
02:22:30,661 --> 02:22:35,160
journalist from the atlantic monthly and
it was a relatively long form interview.

3014
02:22:35,161 --> 02:22:37,890
I think we talked for 40 minutes,
something like that,

3015
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:40,980
and it's going to be edited now.
I trusted her.

3016
02:22:41,130 --> 02:22:41,963
I trust her now.
Whether that'll be how that will play 

3017
02:22:44,791 --> 02:22:45,624
out in the final edit.
I don't know because she won't be the 

3018
02:22:47,551 --> 02:22:49,790
only one making the decision.
Well,

3019
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:51,210
the question is,
should have I done it?

3020
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,230
Well,
look,

3021
02:22:52,830 --> 02:22:55,420
it was the aspen ideas festival to 
different audience.

3022
02:22:55,421 --> 02:22:57,030
It's left leaning.
I thought,

3023
02:22:57,031 --> 02:22:58,890
well maybe I'll go talk to a left 
leading audience.

3024
02:22:58,891 --> 02:23:00,930
People are always criticizing me for not
doing that.

3025
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:03,180
I usually don't do it because I don't 
get invited,

3026
02:23:03,450 --> 02:23:04,283
but so I went and talked to them.
It's like barry weiss interviewed me in 

3027
02:23:06,601 --> 02:23:07,434
front of the aspen ideas festival and 
that was long form uncut and put it on 

3028
02:23:09,841 --> 02:23:13,140
the web and so maybe that was useful.
The atlantic thing.

3029
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,330
Well,
it might be good.

3030
02:23:15,390 --> 02:23:16,223
We'll see.
It does expose me to the risk though 

3031
02:23:17,561 --> 02:23:21,240
because it will be edited so it was wise
to do it.

3032
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:30,050
Look,
I've been fortunate so far,

3033
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:32,563
despite the fact that I've been taken 
out of context at times and fairly 

3034
02:23:37,191 --> 02:23:38,024
significant proportion of times,
but not the overwhelming majority of 

3035
02:23:40,491 --> 02:23:41,324
times.
The net consequence of all of that has 

3036
02:23:44,151 --> 02:23:49,151
been to engage more and more people into
complex dialogue as far as I can tell,

3037
02:23:49,771 --> 02:23:53,070
so that's the good.
That's the good.

3038
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:54,053
It doesn't mean that the strategy that 
I've implemented so far is the only 

3039
02:23:57,211 --> 02:23:59,160
strategy that will work into the future.

3040
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:03,040
We can also clearly establish it.
You didn't plan any of this to happen,

3041
02:24:03,070 --> 02:24:03,903
this,
this whole thing that happened from you 

3042
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:09,780
opposing that bill and then going to 
where you are.

3043
02:24:09,781 --> 02:24:11,190
How many years later now?
Two years.

3044
02:24:11,191 --> 02:24:13,170
Two years almost.
That's fucking crazy.

3045
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:14,113
Yeah.
I mean you think about the 

3046
02:24:14,851 --> 02:24:18,360
transformation of your life and your.
Your public image.

3047
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:20,250
I mean it's unprecedented.
I don't.

3048
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:21,113
I can't think of a single public 
intellectual that has gone from being a 

3049
02:24:24,061 --> 02:24:28,110
universal university professor to being 
essentially a household name.

3050
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:29,183
I mean,
you get brought up With at least my 

3051
02:24:30,421 --> 02:24:33,960
circle of friends all the time and 
people that I run into all the time.

3052
02:24:33,961 --> 02:24:34,794
I can't tell you how many people have 
run into after comedy shows or in an 

3053
02:24:37,411 --> 02:24:38,244
airport that they talk to me about you.
So this is a mainstream thing and not 

3054
02:24:45,050 --> 02:24:46,170
just no precedent.

3055
02:24:46,390 --> 02:24:47,410
No.
Well,

3056
02:24:47,411 --> 02:24:48,250
it's partly,
you know,

3057
02:24:48,251 --> 02:24:50,470
that's also part of it,
the conseqUeNces of this technology.

3058
02:24:50,471 --> 02:24:51,020
It's like,
yes,

3059
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:52,710
you know,
like in 2013,

3060
02:24:52,730 --> 02:24:53,770
I thought,
huh,

3061
02:24:53,771 --> 02:24:57,070
I wonder what will happen if I put my 
lectures up on youtube.

3062
02:24:57,310 --> 02:24:58,143
It's like beware man.
And that's what I thought when I made 

3063
02:25:01,831 --> 02:25:04,180
the bill see 16 videos.
I got up at like two in the morning.

3064
02:25:04,181 --> 02:25:06,490
I thought this is bloody well driving me
crazy.

3065
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:11,260
that damn university is going to force a
UNconscious bias retraining,

3066
02:25:11,380 --> 02:25:12,213
which is not a validated process by any 
stretch of the imagination on its 

3067
02:25:15,071 --> 02:25:15,904
employees.
And I worked for the university and I'm 

3068
02:25:16,961 --> 02:25:18,070
a psychologist.
So

3069
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:20,210
what is the what's,
why are they doing that?

3070
02:25:20,330 --> 02:25:21,163
Why would they do that?
They did do that to silence that are 

3071
02:25:23,381 --> 02:25:26,170
protesting.
Are they doing that because they want to

3072
02:25:26,171 --> 02:25:28,360
enforce a certain type of behavior,

3073
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:29,453
why they think there's two reasons.
I think that there's some genuine 

3074
02:25:32,011 --> 02:25:32,844
concern for the dispossessed and then 
there's some hatred for the successful 

3075
02:25:36,301 --> 02:25:39,030
and some envy and some resentment.
It's like everything that people do,

3076
02:25:39,031 --> 02:25:40,200
it's complicated,
you know,

3077
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:44,640
but the pathology is well that the hr 
types,

3078
02:25:44,641 --> 02:25:48,360
for example at the university think it's
okay for them to read train other people

3079
02:25:48,361 --> 02:25:52,660
about their hypothetical views on the 
off chance that they might be racist and

3080
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:53,553
and forcing them to admit that they're 
racist by making them agree to 

3081
02:25:55,951 --> 02:25:58,580
participate in the training.
I don't think that,

3082
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:01,410
but for me that waSn't even the.
The issue,

3083
02:26:01,411 --> 02:26:02,244
although it was an issue.
The issue is we can't measure 

3084
02:26:04,651 --> 02:26:05,484
unconscious bias reliably and validly.
I'm a psychologist and a research 

3085
02:26:08,941 --> 02:26:10,530
psychologist.
I know the literature,

3086
02:26:10,531 --> 02:26:12,870
that's a misuse of it.
It's a misuse of it.

3087
02:26:12,871 --> 02:26:13,704
And the damn university was doing it.
They were hiring consUltants who didn't 

3088
02:26:16,141 --> 02:26:17,390
know what the hell they were talking 
about.

3089
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:19,440
Let me ask you this.
If they are,

3090
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:22,080
this is a universities,
this is a,

3091
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:23,353
an establishment for higher learning.
How can they possibly act on something 

3092
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:32,740
when there's no clear evidence that it's
real,

3093
02:26:32,741 --> 02:26:35,920
that it works,
that it's effective and they're doing it

3094
02:26:35,921 --> 02:26:36,754
just to make people happy or just to 
make themselves happy or just to 

3095
02:26:39,701 --> 02:26:41,200
reinforce an idea that they want

3096
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:42,270
to be told.
That's the thing.

3097
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:43,410
That's the thing.
It's part of.

3098
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,273
For me,
it was part of the head gemini of the 

3099
02:26:45,871 --> 02:26:47,300
radical left.
It's like,

3100
02:26:47,350 --> 02:26:48,000
no,
no,

3101
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,760
you're not going to do that at the 
university.

3102
02:26:50,761 --> 02:26:51,594
I work out without me telling people 
that there's no warrant for that from 

3103
02:26:55,831 --> 02:26:58,530
the psychological community.
So anyways,

3104
02:26:58,531 --> 02:27:00,360
I got up at two in the morning and made 
these videos.

3105
02:27:00,361 --> 02:27:01,050
I thought,
well,

3106
02:27:01,050 --> 02:27:02,730
let's see what happens if I make these 
videos.

3107
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:03,481
It's like,
well,

3108
02:27:03,481 --> 02:27:07,590
this is back to the technology issue.
It's like I didn't know what youtube was

3109
02:27:07,591 --> 02:27:10,410
when I put my videos on it.
You didn't know what youtube was.

3110
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:11,250
Well,
you know what I.

3111
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:14,190
No one knows what youtube is.
Now the thing,

3112
02:27:14,191 --> 02:27:17,220
we'll look at what happened to you.
You have a million,

3113
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:18,053
billion and a half downloads a year.
It's like you're definitely riding a 

3114
02:27:20,701 --> 02:27:21,450
giant wave.

3115
02:27:21,450 --> 02:27:23,970
like what have you predicted this 15 
yeArs ago?

3116
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:25,680
No,
so.

3117
02:27:25,681 --> 02:27:26,514
So you know you're in the right place 
and the right time and you're a very 

3118
02:27:28,441 --> 02:27:29,274
interesting interview because while,
especially for long form because you're 

3119
02:27:32,191 --> 02:27:35,340
very,
very curious,

3120
02:27:35,910 --> 02:27:37,320
but also very,
very tough.

3121
02:27:37,321 --> 02:27:38,154
Like it's interesting watching you 
because if you don't understand 

3122
02:27:40,411 --> 02:27:41,244
something you will go after the person 
and you're not doing it in a vindictive 

3123
02:27:43,921 --> 02:27:44,754
way,
but you're quite a formidable interview 

3124
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:46,683
and I've been trying to figure out why 
you're so successful and like you're a 

3125
02:27:49,621 --> 02:27:52,680
lot smarter than anyone might think,
which is quite interesting.

3126
02:27:52,681 --> 02:27:53,514
So you're a weird combination because 
you know your persona doesn't shout 

3127
02:27:56,490 --> 02:27:57,323
intEllectual but you're damn smart and 
you're tough as a bloody boot and you 

3128
02:28:00,331 --> 02:28:01,164
ask rudy pop provocative questions and 
not because you're provocative and so 

3129
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:07,860
your personality in this long form seem 
to suit each other really well.

3130
02:28:07,861 --> 02:28:08,694
You're also really good at pursuing 
things you don't understand instead of 

3131
02:28:11,191 --> 02:28:12,810
assuming that you know what you're 
talking about,

3132
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:15,390
so you take the listeners on a journey,
right?

3133
02:28:15,391 --> 02:28:16,224
It's an exploratory journey,
but fundamentally what's propelled you 

3134
02:28:19,441 --> 02:28:21,950
to superstardom in some sense is not

3135
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:23,930
just your ability,
which is non trivial,

3136
02:28:23,931 --> 02:28:27,290
but the fact that you're on this giant 
technological wave and you're one of the

3137
02:28:27,291 --> 02:28:28,124
first adopters and I'm in the same 
situation where first adopters of 

3138
02:28:32,390 --> 02:28:35,030
technology,
that's as revolutionary as the gutenberg

3139
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:36,133
printing press,
and so that's all unfolding in real 

3140
02:28:38,151 --> 02:28:38,984
time.
IT's like,

3141
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:40,790
look at what's happening.
Yeah,

3142
02:28:40,791 --> 02:28:41,624
well,
the spoken word is now as powerful as 

3143
02:28:43,251 --> 02:28:47,510
the written word that's never happened 
before in human history and we're on the

3144
02:28:47,511 --> 02:28:49,190
cutting edge of that.
For better or worse.

3145
02:28:49,370 --> 02:28:51,910
That's a very good way to put it.
The spoken word is power.

3146
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:53,350
Yeah,
and maybe even more so.

3147
02:28:53,351 --> 02:28:54,184
Well,
he's so accessible to people that don't 

3148
02:28:55,191 --> 02:28:59,050
have the time to read well or stuck in 
traffic or or.

3149
02:28:59,051 --> 02:28:59,884
And here's another possibility may be 10
times as many people can listen to 

3150
02:29:02,961 --> 02:29:07,490
complex information as can read complex 
information in terms of their ability to

3151
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:09,620
process it.

3152
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:11,150
Sure could easily.
We don't know.

3153
02:29:11,151 --> 02:29:11,984
Maybe it's maybe it's the same.
Certainly easier to listen to a book on 

3154
02:29:14,721 --> 02:29:16,580
tape for me than it is to read a book.
Yeah.

3155
02:29:16,581 --> 02:29:17,140
Well,
so,

3156
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:19,490
so the question is for how many people 
is that true?

3157
02:29:19,491 --> 02:29:21,140
And I would say it might be true for 
the,

3158
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:24,410
for the majority of people.
And then people are doing hybrids,

3159
02:29:24,411 --> 02:29:25,244
you know,
so because you can sync your book with 

3160
02:29:27,411 --> 02:29:28,400
audible.
Right?

3161
02:29:28,401 --> 02:29:31,700
So they read when they have the time,
but then when they have found time,

3162
02:29:31,701 --> 02:29:35,870
which is also a major component of this,
that that's the time when you're driving

3163
02:29:35,871 --> 02:29:36,704
or the time when you're doing dishes is 
now all of a sudden you can educate 

3164
02:29:38,571 --> 02:29:41,840
yourself during that found time.
ThiS is a big revolution.

3165
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:45,200
And the blowing out the bandwidth makes 
a huge difference.

3166
02:29:45,201 --> 02:29:46,970
Because while we talked about that at 
the beginning,

3167
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:48,373
looks like people are more intelligent 
than we thought And you and I are both 

3168
02:29:51,201 --> 02:29:52,910
in the rest of this intellectual,
dark web.

3169
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:53,743
That's kind of what unites us.
Hey is everybody has an independent 

3170
02:29:56,421 --> 02:29:57,980
platform.
Virtually everybody,

3171
02:29:58,730 --> 02:30:00,590
they have an idiosyncratic view point.
They,

3172
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:01,523
they're interested in having discussions
and pursuing the furtherance of their 

3173
02:30:04,311 --> 02:30:07,340
knowledge even though they Might have a 
priority ideological commitments.

3174
02:30:07,341 --> 02:30:10,970
Sam does and I suppose I do and and ben 
shapiro certainly does,

3175
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:13,430
but they're still interested in having 
the discussion,

3176
02:30:13,790 --> 02:30:14,623
but more importantly they're 
capitalizing on the long form and the 

3177
02:30:17,991 --> 02:30:18,824
fact that that's possible is a 
reflection of this technological 

3178
02:30:20,661 --> 02:30:21,494
transformation and the technological 
transfer information might be utterly 

3179
02:30:24,651 --> 02:30:26,810
profound.
It looks like it.

3180
02:30:27,590 --> 02:30:28,620
And so that's,
you know,

3181
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:30,800
I've been trying to sort this out 
because I keep thinking,

3182
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:33,200
why the hell are these people coming to 
listen to what I'm saying?

3183
02:30:33,201 --> 02:30:33,861
It's like,
well,

3184
02:30:33,861 --> 02:30:34,950
I'm a guru.
You know,

3185
02:30:34,970 --> 02:30:36,650
I'm a sage.
It's something like that.

3186
02:30:36,651 --> 02:30:39,230
It's like,
don't be thinking that first.

3187
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:43,370
Think if there's situational 
determinants first.

3188
02:30:43,610 --> 02:30:45,710
Take your damn personality out of it.
Okay.

3189
02:30:45,711 --> 02:30:47,420
What's going on?
Oh yes,

3190
02:30:47,421 --> 02:30:50,480
this is all fostered by youtube and 
fostered by podcasts.

3191
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:54,470
What's so new about that?
No bandwidth restrictions,

3192
02:30:54,710 --> 02:30:55,543
no barrier to entrance,
possibility of dialogue because people 

3193
02:30:59,121 --> 02:31:02,120
cut up the youtube videos into chunks 
and make their own comments on it.

3194
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:04,610
It's a whole new communication 
technology.

3195
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:05,563
Also a lack of interference by 
executives and producers and all these 

3196
02:31:08,271 --> 02:31:10,760
different people that have their own 
bias unmediated.

3197
02:31:10,820 --> 02:31:12,350
Yes.
Unmediated as giant.

3198
02:31:12,351 --> 02:31:12,711
Yeah.
Yeah.

3199
02:31:12,711 --> 02:31:13,550
Well,
and that's all part of.

3200
02:31:13,670 --> 02:31:14,503
Part of the reason you're so popular too
is like you just put this on like so 

3201
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:19,440
you've got exactly the right of

3202
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:25,050
a competent production because there's 
nothing access about it.

3203
02:31:25,561 --> 02:31:27,600
Like it's competent,
but no more than that.

3204
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:30,120
I know that's by design,
but you also don't edit it.

3205
02:31:30,121 --> 02:31:33,330
It's like what you see is what you get.
It's like everyone is relieved by that.

3206
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:36,450
We can make our own damn decisions.
do I think that's very important?

3207
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,970
If you're going to have a conversation 
with someone is honest,

3208
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:43,720
you can't decide what to leave in,
what to take out and it's just,

3209
02:31:43,721 --> 02:31:44,554
well,
that's partly also why I deal with the 

3210
02:31:45,721 --> 02:31:46,554
press the way I do.
Like if I'm going to have a full 

3211
02:31:48,001 --> 02:31:48,834
conversation,
it's like I'm willing to take the hits 

3212
02:31:51,010 --> 02:31:51,843
and I understand what you're saying,
but that's one of the reasons why it 

3213
02:31:53,671 --> 02:31:56,700
frustrates me so much is that I see what
they're doing and I'm like,

3214
02:31:56,701 --> 02:31:59,940
what you're doing is ancient.
What you're doing is it's,

3215
02:31:59,950 --> 02:32:00,280
it's.

3216
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:03,030
This is what people did 20 years ago,
30 years ago for.

3217
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:05,910
you can't really do that anymore.
He can't misrepresent.

3218
02:32:05,911 --> 02:32:07,950
People used to be able to.
If you were in the press,

3219
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:10,170
you can take people quoted out of 
context,

3220
02:32:10,171 --> 02:32:11,004
do whatever the fuck you wanted to put 
an article about them and they couldn't 

3221
02:32:12,841 --> 02:32:17,730
do a god damn thing about it.
It happened to me in 19 boy.

3222
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:23,210
It was like 99.
I did a comedy cd that came out and this

3223
02:32:23,521 --> 02:32:25,340
woman wrote an article about it and it 
just.

3224
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:29,250
She just lied.
She lied about my perspective.

3225
02:32:29,251 --> 02:32:32,910
She lied about the bits,
she misquoted the bits.

3226
02:32:32,970 --> 02:32:33,803
She didn't just paraphrase them,
she changed what the bits were to make 

3227
02:32:37,711 --> 02:32:42,510
them know misogynist or hateful or 
whatever it was.

3228
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:46,350
And in doing so I,
there was no recourse.

3229
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:47,940
There was nothing that I could do about 
that.

3230
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:48,690
I'm like,
wow,

3231
02:32:48,690 --> 02:32:50,460
I'd never experienced that before.
I was like,

3232
02:32:50,461 --> 02:32:51,294
this is stunning.
And then I found out this person did 

3233
02:32:52,651 --> 02:32:53,484
that a lot and this is what she did and 
there's ultimate power that comes with 

3234
02:32:56,791 --> 02:32:57,624
being the person that has the pen being 
the person that has the typewriter and 

3235
02:32:59,821 --> 02:33:00,654
you,
you're the person who works for the 

3236
02:33:01,891 --> 02:33:03,780
boston globe or whatever the publication
is,

3237
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:07,800
that that is something that existed 
forever,

3238
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:08,993
you know,
and that you had to be either a friend 

3239
02:33:11,251 --> 02:33:13,350
of the press,
you had to play ball,

3240
02:33:13,351 --> 02:33:15,390
you had to,
you had a bend to their will,

3241
02:33:15,510 --> 02:33:16,343
you have to do what they wanted you to 
do and they could misrepresent you and 

3242
02:33:19,171 --> 02:33:21,000
choose to paint you in any way they 
like.

3243
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:23,580
And it's one of the reasons why I don't 
do anything anymore.

3244
02:33:23,610 --> 02:33:25,530
We don't do any interviews anymore.
I don't do anything,

3245
02:33:25,531 --> 02:33:26,460
I don't want to do anything.

3246
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:27,840
Just I do enough,
man.

3247
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:31,230
You want to know about me?
Fucking there's a thousand Podcasts,

3248
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:33,720
there's more than a thousand years.
I think there's,

3249
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:37,330
there's 1100 and there's a bunch of 
other ones too.

3250
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:39,830
Let's just doesn't make any sense.
It so well that,

3251
02:33:39,850 --> 02:33:40,510
that's,
that,

3252
02:33:40,510 --> 02:33:41,343
that it may also be the position that I 
increasingly find myself yet I think 

3253
02:33:45,241 --> 02:33:49,200
it's the right position because then the
misrepresentations don't exist anymore.

3254
02:33:49,201 --> 02:33:50,034
So then the only problem is the dispute 
over the actual ideological 

3255
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:54,320
conversations or the,
uh,

3256
02:33:54,330 --> 02:33:56,400
the actual concept.
But you know,

3257
02:33:56,401 --> 02:33:57,500
the thing is,
you know,

3258
02:33:57,510 --> 02:33:58,343
you made a point there that's quite 
interesting is like we are in a new 

3259
02:34:00,331 --> 02:34:03,240
media landscape.
So now if someone comes out as a,

3260
02:34:03,660 --> 02:34:04,493
as a media figure with some 
institutional credibility and 

3261
02:34:08,881 --> 02:34:11,640
misrepresents,
it's exposed.

3262
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:12,563
And so then the question is how much 
risk should you shoulder to expose the 

3263
02:34:16,201 --> 02:34:18,520
proclivity for misrepresentation

3264
02:34:18,910 --> 02:34:22,600
and answer to that might be some now it 
might be moving,

3265
02:34:22,601 --> 02:34:24,280
you know,
maybe I've done enough of that.

3266
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:25,713
I mean,
it would be easier for me in many ways 

3267
02:34:26,921 --> 02:34:28,780
if I just stopped doing it,
but,

3268
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:34,300
but there is some utility in having it 
play out and so while,

3269
02:34:34,301 --> 02:34:35,134
so I'm trying to.
I'm trying to only take those 

3270
02:34:37,121 --> 02:34:37,954
opportunities that appear to have more 
benefit than risk and when I'm defining 

3271
02:34:43,831 --> 02:34:44,664
benefit,
well the question is then what 

3272
02:34:46,581 --> 02:34:47,414
constitutes benefit and I guess what 
constitutes benefit is while that would 

3273
02:34:52,101 --> 02:34:52,934
further the attempts that I making to 
bring information to a vast number of 

3274
02:34:57,771 --> 02:34:58,604
people that could conceivably help them 
stabilize and improve their individual 

3275
02:35:02,481 --> 02:35:04,370
lives,
that's worth a certain amount of risk.

3276
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:06,220
Well,
it certainly increases your profile,

3277
02:35:06,221 --> 02:35:07,054
increases your profile and even if you 
have 60 percent of these people are 

3278
02:35:10,481 --> 02:35:13,270
gonna get a bad perception of you.
Forty percent of these people that never

3279
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:14,104
heard of you,
now we're going to understand who you 

3280
02:35:15,131 --> 02:35:16,990
are because they do further 
investigation.

3281
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:19,120
So there's some benefit in that.
But the,

3282
02:35:19,121 --> 02:35:20,290
the negative.
I mean I've,

3283
02:35:20,350 --> 02:35:23,620
I get text messages from random people 
that I was friends with years ago.

3284
02:35:23,830 --> 02:35:24,663
Let's say there's Jordan Peterson has 
just such a lying sack of shit and he's 

3285
02:35:27,610 --> 02:35:29,890
like,
I don't even know who the fuck you are.

3286
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:32,680
And then second of all like,
why are you contacting me?

3287
02:35:32,681 --> 02:35:36,790
You're not even saying hi.
You're saying Jordan Peterson is a mrs.

3288
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:37,720
Yeah,
yeah.

3289
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:40,690
Well there's an emergency at hand.
He's a scam artist.

3290
02:35:40,691 --> 02:35:42,460
He's a fraud.
He's and I'm like,

3291
02:35:42,490 --> 02:35:44,860
wow.
And so they'll see an interview,

3292
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:47,170
you know like the,
the jim jefferies clip,

3293
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:48,910
which is a minute long or whatever it 
is,

3294
02:35:49,090 --> 02:35:49,923
or the vice piece or the initial kathy 
newman piece and they just formed this 

3295
02:35:55,720 --> 02:35:59,830
determined position on you and then read
hit pieces on you.

3296
02:36:00,010 --> 02:36:02,530
And then this is where they take their 
opinion out.

3297
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:05,120
This is where it's from.
It's and it's,

3298
02:36:06,110 --> 02:36:06,943
I,
I feel like these are the last gasps of 

3299
02:36:09,251 --> 02:36:11,200
a dying medium.
I really do.

3300
02:36:11,230 --> 02:36:12,310
I just,
I think too,

3301
02:36:12,910 --> 02:36:15,610
I don't,
I don't think that people appreciate it.

3302
02:36:15,611 --> 02:36:16,444
I think the people that are listening to
this that do appreciate long form 

3303
02:36:18,431 --> 02:36:21,250
conversations and with all warts and 
all,

3304
02:36:21,251 --> 02:36:22,084
all the ugliness and the mistakes and 
the critical errors and the people that 

3305
02:36:26,411 --> 02:36:27,940
appreciate that,
they,

3306
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:28,833
they,
they have a real hate for being lied to 

3307
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:34,780
because it's it.
It changed when

3308
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:37,560
when you're being treated as if they're 
stupid,

3309
02:36:38,570 --> 02:36:39,403
which they aren't.

3310
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:41,120
Yeah,
that's both.

3311
02:36:41,190 --> 02:36:42,050
It's just,
it's,

3312
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:43,273
it's deceptive when you,
when you edit someone and take their 

3313
02:36:47,121 --> 02:36:49,130
words out of context and change them 
around,

3314
02:36:49,131 --> 02:36:49,964
you're being deceptive.

3315
02:36:49,990 --> 02:36:52,040
Did The New York times did that again 
this week?

3316
02:36:52,041 --> 02:36:52,874
They had some philosophy.
Professor from Hong Kong university 

3317
02:36:54,621 --> 02:36:56,510
wrote a piece on me and he.
He took,

3318
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,553
they quoted me a was a sentence.
The first phrase was in quotes and then 

3319
02:37:00,951 --> 02:37:01,784
there were some joining words and then 
the second phrase was in quotes and 

3320
02:37:03,621 --> 02:37:04,454
there were some joining words and then 
the third phrase was in quotes and the 

3321
02:37:06,621 --> 02:37:07,454
three quotes added up to a statement 
that bore no resemblance whatsoever to 

3322
02:37:10,251 --> 02:37:11,084
what I was saying.

3323
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:12,900
How can they do that in the New York 
times?

3324
02:37:13,050 --> 02:37:16,230
That seems to me to be something should 
be the the

3325
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:19,280
synthesis of what they think they can 
do.

3326
02:37:19,281 --> 02:37:23,270
I think they're killing their brand so 
fast that they can't put it.

3327
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:24,113
It's so disturbing to me as a person 
who's been a fan of the New York times 

3328
02:37:26,631 --> 02:37:27,464
forever.
I just don't understand how they could 

3329
02:37:28,671 --> 02:37:31,310
allow that to happen.
How could you allow your.

3330
02:37:32,170 --> 02:37:35,450
What is the gold standard for 
journalism?

3331
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:36,493
How could you allow it to become 
something that willfully misrepresent 

3332
02:37:39,351 --> 02:37:40,184
someone but they never did to push an 
ideology or did put my book on the New 

3333
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:45,440
York times bestseller list?
It's quite comical.

3334
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:47,390
How's that possible?
Oh,

3335
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:49,550
they have rules which they don't 
disclose,

3336
02:37:49,580 --> 02:37:51,290
but one of them apparently is.
Well,

3337
02:37:51,291 --> 02:37:54,140
if the book is published in Canada and 
distributed in the United States,

3338
02:37:54,141 --> 02:37:54,974
then it doesn't count.
Even though they've had books like that 

3339
02:37:56,601 --> 02:37:59,420
on the New York times best seller list 
before and I think,

3340
02:37:59,421 --> 02:38:01,070
okay,
well is this bad or good?

3341
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:01,731
It's like,
well,

3342
02:38:01,731 --> 02:38:02,564
it's bad because to the degree that I 
might want to be on the New York times 

3343
02:38:05,421 --> 02:38:07,580
best seller list,
although I haven't been losing any sleep

3344
02:38:07,581 --> 02:38:08,690
over it,
but you're selling.

3345
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:10,730
I know how many books are selling.
Yeah,

3346
02:38:10,731 --> 02:38:11,564
it's basically been the best selling 
book in the world since january know 

3347
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:15,033
it's gone up and down to some degree,
but fundamentally it should be the 

3348
02:38:17,271 --> 02:38:19,370
number one New York times best selling 
book.

3349
02:38:19,371 --> 02:38:20,060
So they,
they,

3350
02:38:20,060 --> 02:38:21,450
they,
they have their reasons and.

3351
02:38:21,470 --> 02:38:22,303
But I look at that and I think,
oh well you can only do that 10 times 

3352
02:38:25,131 --> 02:38:28,070
until you're done.
Like because it's a fatal error.

3353
02:38:28,250 --> 02:38:30,290
You have the gold standard for 
measurement.

3354
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:34,430
You're not measuring properly.
You're burning up your brand.

3355
02:38:34,460 --> 02:38:35,293
You think,
well we're the New York times so we can 

3356
02:38:36,471 --> 02:38:37,580
burn up our brand.
It's like,

3357
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:38,661
no,
you can't.

3358
02:38:38,661 --> 02:38:42,560
Newsweek is gone.
Time magazine is a shallow is a shell of

3359
02:38:42,561 --> 02:38:43,550
its former self.

3360
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:45,043
Like the big things disappear and they 
disappeared when they get crooked and 

3361
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:49,333
ideologically rigid.
And so that's what's happening at the 

3362
02:38:51,921 --> 02:38:54,260
New York times.
Not with everyone there,

3363
02:38:54,261 --> 02:38:58,310
but with plenty of them.
and it'll die faster than people think,

3364
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:03,170
but it's so confusing to me that it 
didn't use to be that.

3365
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:04,640
Yup.
And now it is.

3366
02:39:04,641 --> 02:39:05,474
And they just responding to this new 
world where you have to have click bait 

3367
02:39:09,141 --> 02:39:09,974
journalism and some people are 
struggling to find people to actually 

3368
02:39:13,281 --> 02:39:16,320
buy physical newspapers,
which is two different things.

3369
02:39:16,321 --> 02:39:17,154
It's hard to say like because maybe see,
it's weird because you don't have to 

3370
02:39:20,241 --> 02:39:21,074
resort to click bait because these long 
form discussions are the antithesis of 

3371
02:39:25,470 --> 02:39:28,700
clickbait,
but are they struggling in terms of like

3372
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:31,130
how many people buy their newspaper?
Oh,

3373
02:39:31,131 --> 02:39:32,420
absolutely.
Every newspaper,

3374
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:33,283
the newspapers in Canada went cap in 
hand to the federal government for 

3375
02:39:35,721 --> 02:39:36,554
subsidies about six months ago because 
they're dying so fast and so some of it 

3376
02:39:40,011 --> 02:39:42,260
is they're being supplanted by 
technology.

3377
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:45,100
ThAt's a huge part of it,
but as they are supplanted,

3378
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:45,943
they get more desperate.
They publish more polarizing stories 

3379
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:50,840
that works in the short term to garner 
more views,

3380
02:39:50,841 --> 02:39:54,050
but it alienates people from the brand 
and speeds their demise.

3381
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:55,063
Classic death spiral of a big of a big 
organization and that's going to clean 

3382
02:39:59,211 --> 02:40:00,044
things out like mad.
I mean I don't know where cnn is in the 

3383
02:40:02,031 --> 02:40:04,340
cable news rankings now,
a cable show rankings,

3384
02:40:04,341 --> 02:40:05,174
but it keeps falling but it's falling in
the rankings as cable itself 

3385
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:12,020
disintegrates and dies.
Why do you need cable tv?

3386
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:14,070
No one needs cable

3387
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:14,913
t the only people who have cable tv or 
the people who figure haven't figured 

3388
02:40:17,251 --> 02:40:21,540
out yet that you can replace it entirely
online for like one 10th the price with,

3389
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:22,130
with

3390
02:40:22,130 --> 02:40:22,963
less hassle.
But the irony is people want a location 

3391
02:40:25,251 --> 02:40:26,084
they can go to to find out what's going 
on in the world and this is the one 

3392
02:40:28,671 --> 02:40:31,670
thing that they use to represent and you
know,

3393
02:40:31,671 --> 02:40:33,560
I mean I don't think fox news is any 
better.

3394
02:40:33,561 --> 02:40:36,230
I think you,
you just have these ideological extremes

3395
02:40:36,231 --> 02:40:40,070
left and right.
And I remember very clearly watching the

3396
02:40:40,100 --> 02:40:44,420
election coverage before the election,
like leading up to the election,

3397
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:46,820
I would go fox news and then I go see an
ent.

3398
02:40:46,821 --> 02:40:47,654
I just would go back and forth with them
on my cable and I would just be 

3399
02:40:49,971 --> 02:40:50,840
laughing.
I'll be like,

3400
02:40:50,841 --> 02:40:51,674
what is really happening in the world?
Because I'm getting two different 

3401
02:40:53,901 --> 02:40:54,734
stories.
I'm getting Russia and I'm getting 

3402
02:40:56,181 --> 02:40:57,530
hillary's emails.
This is,

3403
02:40:57,640 --> 02:40:59,060
I don't know what the fuck is,
what?

3404
02:40:59,090 --> 02:40:59,923
What is happening?
I'm getting pussy grabbing and I'm 

3405
02:41:01,851 --> 02:41:02,880
getting,
you know,

3406
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:03,833
a bengazi yup.
this is what I'm getting and I don't 

3407
02:41:06,411 --> 02:41:09,860
understand like why this is obviously 
ideological.

3408
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:10,813
This is not just.
It might be that as the technology is 

3409
02:41:13,431 --> 02:41:14,264
supplanted,
the ideological polarization increases 

3410
02:41:17,511 --> 02:41:19,040
as the thing dies,
right?

3411
02:41:19,041 --> 02:41:19,874
They're struggling for anyone to pay 
attention and this is the way they have 

3412
02:41:22,401 --> 02:41:23,420
to do it to ensure.

3413
02:41:23,530 --> 02:41:27,410
And I think what's happening on the 
other side which is decide you occupy,

3414
02:41:27,411 --> 02:41:28,244
say is that a new technology that's long
form that deals with many of those 

3415
02:41:32,171 --> 02:41:34,320
problems is emerging and it's going to 
emerge.

3416
02:41:34,380 --> 02:41:35,213
It's going to be victorious,
but in the main might already be 

3417
02:41:37,471 --> 02:41:38,304
victorious in the meantime.
Bad stuff still exists in the digital 

3418
02:41:42,091 --> 02:41:43,280
world.
you know,

3419
02:41:43,290 --> 02:41:45,600
and then you're getting a lot of the 
articles that are written about you.

3420
02:41:45,601 --> 02:41:48,390
People are absorbing these articles,
not from a physical form.

3421
02:41:48,391 --> 02:41:50,340
You're getting it from.
From digital.

3422
02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:51,241
Yeah.
Well okay.

3423
02:41:51,241 --> 02:41:52,074
So then the sense is,
well do you have fundamental trust in 

3424
02:41:54,061 --> 02:41:59,061
the judgment of your fellow man,
let's say in my answer to that is yes,

3425
02:41:59,131 --> 02:41:59,964
because although I've been pilloried to 
a great degree by the radical types in 

3426
02:42:03,931 --> 02:42:07,230
the commentary in the classic 
journalists,

3427
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:10,003
the comments with regards to me on 
youtube are 50 to one in my favor and 

3428
02:42:14,860 --> 02:42:18,140
that's even the case when the ideologues
put up videos about me,

3429
02:42:18,141 --> 02:42:22,280
they're designed to discredit me and 
I've sold a million and a half books.

3430
02:42:22,430 --> 02:42:23,263
It's going to be published in 40 
countries and thousands of people are 

3431
02:42:26,061 --> 02:42:26,894
coming to my lectures and so I would say
the attempts to discredit me aren't 

3432
02:42:30,951 --> 02:42:35,951
working so and now I think that's 
because that even like even if you go to

3433
02:42:35,961 --> 02:42:36,794
youtube,
you can see Jordan Peterson smashes 

3434
02:42:38,691 --> 02:42:40,970
leftist journalist,
you know as a clickbait thing.

3435
02:42:40,971 --> 02:42:44,540
Someone's taken a two minute clip from a
video and they put it out in there using

3436
02:42:44,541 --> 02:42:46,520
that clickbait headlines to attract 
attention.

3437
02:42:46,521 --> 02:42:47,354
It's like it does attract attention and 
that probably even further as 

3438
02:42:49,581 --> 02:42:53,510
polarization,
but I think that most people,

3439
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:55,460
enough people,
that's the prayer.

3440
02:42:55,610 --> 02:42:56,443
Enough people are going for the long 
form thorough discussion so that the 

3441
02:43:00,831 --> 02:43:05,390
sensible will will triumph.
That's what I'm hoping for.

3442
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:06,950
the sensible.
We'll try them.

3443
02:43:06,990 --> 02:43:07,823
No,
I agree and I think that is what's 

3444
02:43:08,611 --> 02:43:12,730
happening and I think that's why this 50
to one number exists is that there,

3445
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:13,613
but the number one in that 50,
the $50 versus the 50 people that are 

3446
02:43:18,581 --> 02:43:19,414
actually understanding what's going on 
and agreeing with you versus the number 

3447
02:43:22,091 --> 02:43:24,910
one that are trying to willfully 
misrepresent you.

3448
02:43:24,911 --> 02:43:28,930
They still exist and they're loud and 
they're fighting to be right and this is

3449
02:43:28,931 --> 02:43:30,400
one of the things that people love to 
do.

3450
02:43:30,820 --> 02:43:31,653
They love to fight to be right.
Instead of examining their position and 

3451
02:43:34,541 --> 02:43:35,374
wondering whether or not they are taking
you out of context and misrepresenting 

3452
02:43:38,170 --> 02:43:39,003
your positions to the world willfully 
and doing so in order to paint a 

3453
02:43:43,001 --> 02:43:46,480
negative picture of you that does not 
act accurately represent who you are,

3454
02:43:46,481 --> 02:43:48,970
what you stand for that,
but by doing this,

3455
02:43:49,270 --> 02:43:51,490
they're destroying virtue without any of
the work.

3456
02:43:51,491 --> 02:43:52,930
They're Also destroying their own 
credibility.

3457
02:43:53,030 --> 02:43:53,863
That's the thing.
This is what's devastating in there 

3458
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:58,630
trying to win.
They're killing themselves,

3459
02:43:58,850 --> 02:43:59,310
right?

3460
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:00,390
Well,
and that's a good.

3461
02:44:00,660 --> 02:44:03,610
that's a good motif for the entire 
conversation.

3462
02:44:03,611 --> 02:44:06,780
It's like try hard to.
Hard to when you kill yourself.

3463
02:44:06,781 --> 02:44:08,070
You were talking last night when we 
were,

3464
02:44:08,071 --> 02:44:08,904
when we were over dinner,
you said that one of the most deadly 

3465
02:44:10,501 --> 02:44:13,950
things for a fighter to do is to 
overestimate his his own position.

3466
02:44:15,110 --> 02:44:18,380
Underestimate your abilities.
if you overestimate your abilities,

3467
02:44:18,381 --> 02:44:19,160
you,
you're,

3468
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:21,470
you're in deep,
deep trouble because you're going to get

3469
02:44:21,471 --> 02:44:22,304
a wake up call and objectivity is one of
the most critical aspects of 

3470
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:27,290
development.
You have to be.

3471
02:44:27,650 --> 02:44:28,483
You have to be objectively assessing 
your strengths and weaknesses at every 

3472
02:44:31,821 --> 02:44:32,480
step of the way.

3473
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:34,230
Now it's bravo bravado,
right?

3474
02:44:34,370 --> 02:44:37,800
I'm trying to prove how am so powerful,
so powerful.

3475
02:44:37,850 --> 02:44:38,683
It's an ego shield and that's why I was 
saying that the ego is the enemy we're 

3476
02:44:40,991 --> 02:44:41,910
talking about.
Right.

3477
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:42,933
So,
you know,

3478
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:45,060
I want to get into this because this is 
a.

3479
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:49,330
I think this is a fascinating thing with
you personally that your diet,

3480
02:44:50,920 --> 02:44:52,540
you're on this carnival.
Yeah.

3481
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:53,511
Now.
Okay.

3482
02:44:53,511 --> 02:44:55,340
So I want to preface that with 
something.

3483
02:44:55,550 --> 02:44:56,383
I am not a dietary expert,
so I've now speaking as an uninformed 

3484
02:44:59,571 --> 02:45:00,220
citizen.

3485
02:45:00,220 --> 02:45:01,053
Yes.
Well this is anecdotal evidence from a 

3486
02:45:02,761 --> 02:45:06,150
human being is dealt with autoimmune 
issues their whole life.

3487
02:45:06,180 --> 02:45:09,450
Yes.
You have done this for how long now?

3488
02:45:10,110 --> 02:45:14,250
I've been on a pure carnivore diet for 
about two months and a pretty,

3489
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:15,393
a very,
very low carb greens only modified 

3490
02:45:17,641 --> 02:45:20,230
carnivore diet for about a year.

3491
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:22,020
so in the year

3492
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:22,730
and,
and,

3493
02:45:22,730 --> 02:45:24,370
and the low carb diet for two years 
years.

3494
02:45:24,430 --> 02:45:27,050
So from the time that I've known you,
I've known you for what,

3495
02:45:27,051 --> 02:45:28,380
two and a half years now.
Something like that.

3496
02:45:28,390 --> 02:45:29,930
Yeah.
When I first met you,

3497
02:45:29,931 --> 02:45:33,020
you had much more weight on your body.
You look different.

3498
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:37,520
And you were back then you're eating 
like standard diet,

3499
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,820
normal people guess pasta,
bread,

3500
02:45:41,270 --> 02:45:42,170
chicken,
whatever.

3501
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:47,030
You shifted over to only meet and 
greens.

3502
02:45:47,031 --> 02:45:48,020
I saw you on.
I'm like,

3503
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:49,400
you look fantastic.
I'm like,

3504
02:45:49,401 --> 02:45:50,750
whAt are you doing?
And you're lIke,

3505
02:45:50,751 --> 02:45:53,010
I changed my diet.
I only meet and greens.

3506
02:45:53,011 --> 02:45:53,811
And I was like,
wow,

3507
02:45:53,811 --> 02:45:54,800
that's fascinating.
Well,

3508
02:45:54,980 --> 02:45:56,390
I felt like,
okay,

3509
02:45:56,391 --> 02:45:57,224
what you're doing is cutting out refined
sugars and all these different things 

3510
02:45:59,391 --> 02:46:01,850
that are problematic.
Preservatives,

3511
02:46:01,851 --> 02:46:02,684
all the bullshit process foods and 
you're having this extreme health 

3512
02:46:05,211 --> 02:46:06,020
benefit.
And I was like,

3513
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:07,340
wow,
that's really excellent.

3514
02:46:07,490 --> 02:46:10,040
You're showing great discipline.
Then you

3515
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,860
decided to take it to another place and 
cut out the greens.

3516
02:46:13,310 --> 02:46:15,830
What was the motivation for cutting out 
the greens?

3517
02:46:16,050 --> 02:46:16,883
All of the motivation for this has been 
my experience with my daughter because 

3518
02:46:19,731 --> 02:46:22,190
she has an unbelievably serious 
autoimmune disease.

3519
02:46:22,191 --> 02:46:23,810
I just talked to her this,
what is it called?

3520
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:25,970
Well,
it's arthritis,

3521
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:28,490
but it there's.
There's way more to it than that,

3522
02:46:28,491 --> 02:46:30,800
but the arthritis was the major set of 
symptoms.

3523
02:46:30,801 --> 02:46:31,634
She had 40 affected joints and she had 
to have her hip replaced and our ankle 

3524
02:46:35,001 --> 02:46:37,040
replaced.
When she was 15 and 16,

3525
02:46:37,041 --> 02:46:41,090
and so she basically hobbled around on 
two broken legs for two years in extreme

3526
02:46:41,091 --> 02:46:43,540
agony and that was just a tiny fraction 
of the,

3527
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:46,850
of the whole set of problems.
I just talked to her this morning.

3528
02:46:46,851 --> 02:46:47,684
She's in chicago,
looks like she has to have her ankle 

3529
02:46:49,401 --> 02:46:52,730
replacement replaced,
so that's next on the horizon,

3530
02:46:53,020 --> 02:46:53,470
but.

3531
02:46:53,470 --> 02:46:55,580
But apart from that she is doing so well
now.

3532
02:46:55,581 --> 02:46:59,390
It is absolutely beyond comprehension.
So she's.

3533
02:46:59,690 --> 02:47:01,310
She's,
she's very trIm.

3534
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:03,380
She had a baby,
but she's very trim.

3535
02:47:03,381 --> 02:47:05,000
She's down to about 100,
18 pounds.

3536
02:47:05,001 --> 02:47:08,630
She's about five foot six.
She's just glowing with health.

3537
02:47:08,990 --> 02:47:11,420
All of her autoimmune system symptoms 
are gone,

3538
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:14,420
all of them.
And she was also seriously depressed,

3539
02:47:14,540 --> 02:47:17,300
severely depressed,
way worse than you think.

3540
02:47:17,301 --> 02:47:20,450
She couldn't stay awake for more than 
about six hours without taking ritalin.

3541
02:47:21,590 --> 02:47:24,920
And she was dying and I had a cousin,
my cousin's daughter,

3542
02:47:25,400 --> 02:47:29,070
she died when she was 30 from an 
associated autoimmune condition.

3543
02:47:29,071 --> 02:47:30,950
So there's a fair bit of this in our 
family.

3544
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:31,903
It was bloody bleak.
I'll tell you and my wife always had a 

3545
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:37,940
suspicion that this was dietary related,
you know,

3546
02:47:37,950 --> 02:47:38,783
and well,
we did notice that when makayla was 

3547
02:47:42,471 --> 02:47:45,740
young,
if she ate oranges or strawberries,

3548
02:47:45,741 --> 02:47:48,140
that she'd get a rash like there were 
there were there,

3549
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:51,650
and then when she developed arthritis,
if she ate oranges in particular,

3550
02:47:51,651 --> 02:47:52,940
that would definitely cause a flare.

3551
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:53,773
It waS the only thing we could see.
The problem is is that in order to 

3552
02:47:56,571 --> 02:47:57,404
identify a dietary component,
the response has to be pretty quick 

3553
02:47:59,631 --> 02:48:01,880
after you eat the thing,
like if it's two days later,

3554
02:48:01,881 --> 02:48:03,290
how the hell are you going to figure 
that out?

3555
02:48:03,310 --> 02:48:08,300
A lot of these responses appear to be 
delayed for four days and last a month,

3556
02:48:08,600 --> 02:48:10,850
so good luck figuring that out.
Anyways,

3557
02:48:10,851 --> 02:48:13,100
mckayla noticed about three years ago 
now,

3558
02:48:13,101 --> 02:48:14,600
more than that now,
five years ago,

3559
02:48:14,930 --> 02:48:19,340
she was at concordia university and 
struggling with her with her illness and

3560
02:48:19,341 --> 02:48:21,350
all the associations associated 
problems.

3561
02:48:21,710 --> 02:48:22,543
She noticed that around exam time she 
was starting to develop real skin 

3562
02:48:25,611 --> 02:48:26,444
problems and my cousin's daughter,
who I mentioned had really bad skin 

3563
02:48:29,991 --> 02:48:30,824
problems and wounds that wouldn't heal 
and that was partly part of the process 

3564
02:48:33,321 --> 02:48:35,690
that eventually killed her and she 
thought,

3565
02:48:35,691 --> 02:48:36,800
oh,
it must be stress,

3566
02:48:36,801 --> 02:48:38,150
and then she thought,
wait a second,

3567
02:48:38,151 --> 02:48:40,130
I really changed my diet when I'm 
studying.

3568
02:48:40,130 --> 02:48:43,220
All I do is eat bagels.
All I do is eat bread sandwiches.

3569
02:48:43,250 --> 02:48:48,250
She thought maybe it's the bread,
so she cut out gluten first and it had a

3570
02:48:49,521 --> 02:48:52,370
remarkable effect,
like really remarkable effect.

3571
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:53,533
And then she,
she went on a radical elimination diet 

3572
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:56,384
all the way down to nothing but chicken 
and broccoli and then her symptoms 

3573
02:48:58,971 --> 02:49:03,230
started to drop off one by one like and 
and like one of the things that happened

3574
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:04,610
is she started to wake up in the 
morning.

3575
02:49:04,611 --> 02:49:05,444
She started to be able to stay awake all
day when you're only staying for six 

3576
02:49:07,561 --> 02:49:09,660
hours with ritalin,
stay awake all day.

3577
02:49:10,110 --> 02:49:13,980
That's like having a life.
And so a whole bunch of things improved.

3578
02:49:14,370 --> 02:49:18,870
Their depression went away and I've had 
depression since I was 13.

3579
02:49:18,871 --> 02:49:21,870
Probably and very severe and I've 
treated it a variety of ways.

3580
02:49:21,871 --> 02:49:22,704
Some of them quite successfully,
but it's been a constant battle and my 

3581
02:49:25,471 --> 02:49:26,304
father had it and his father had it and 
it's all just rife in my family and my 

3582
02:49:30,061 --> 02:49:31,770
wife has autoimmune problems and hurt.

3583
02:49:31,790 --> 02:49:33,150
You say depression?
Define it.

3584
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:36,420
Oh,
would you define it?

3585
02:49:36,810 --> 02:49:38,460
Because that's a word that's a blanket 
term.

3586
02:49:38,461 --> 02:49:39,330
Yeah.
Well,

3587
02:49:39,331 --> 02:49:40,164
imagine.
Imagine that you wake up and that you 

3588
02:49:41,311 --> 02:49:44,640
remember that all your family was killed
in a horrible accident yesterday.

3589
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,860
The you would feel that even if nothing 
was wrong.

3590
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:47,940
Yes.
Yes.

3591
02:49:47,990 --> 02:49:50,730
Just just worse than that because.
Well,

3592
02:49:50,731 --> 02:49:52,800
one of the things mckayla told me what 
she thought,

3593
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:54,180
well,
what's it like to be depressed?

3594
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:55,223
We imagine you have a dog and you really
love the dog and then the dog dies and 

3595
02:49:58,321 --> 02:49:59,154
then about two,
three years ago our dog died and that 

3596
02:50:01,861 --> 02:50:05,850
was mckayla's dog and she really liked 
that dog and she said that was bad,

3597
02:50:05,851 --> 02:50:07,740
but it's nowhere near as bad as being 
depressed.

3598
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:09,113
And I asked her to,
at one point when she was about 15 or 

3599
02:50:10,711 --> 02:50:11,580
16,
I said,

3600
02:50:11,581 --> 02:50:13,320
look,
you've got a choice kid.

3601
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:14,273
Here's the choice.
You can either have depression or 

3602
02:50:16,591 --> 02:50:18,000
arthritis,
which,

3603
02:50:18,001 --> 02:50:18,834
what I'll take the arthritis.
Well that was after she'd lost two 

3604
02:50:22,831 --> 02:50:26,760
joints.
So it was no joke.

3605
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:27,870
It's no joke,
man.

3606
02:50:27,930 --> 02:50:28,910
It,
there isn't any.

3607
02:50:29,390 --> 02:50:30,390
No,
I wouldn't say that.

3608
02:50:30,630 --> 02:50:34,290
I wouldn't say there's nothing worse,
cause worse is a very deep hole.

3609
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:36,810
But it's bad that people will prove you 
wrong,

3610
02:50:36,870 --> 02:50:37,531
right?
Oh yes.

3611
02:50:37,531 --> 02:50:39,570
Definitely.
Worse squares is a deep hole.

3612
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:41,400
Anyways,
her depression went away.

3613
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:44,280
All of these symptoms went away and like
radically.

3614
02:50:44,310 --> 02:50:47,400
So what changed her from chicken and 
broccoli to carnivore?

3615
02:50:47,670 --> 02:50:48,590
Well,
she,

3616
02:50:48,650 --> 02:50:49,483
she,
she kept experimenting and she got very 

3617
02:50:51,571 --> 02:50:54,240
sensitive to all sorts of foods in the 
aftermath of that too.

3618
02:50:54,241 --> 02:50:55,074
So this is why I wouldn't recommend that
anybody does this casually because we 

3619
02:50:57,631 --> 02:51:00,330
don't understand much about it.
But the upshot was that,

3620
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:01,170
well,
she kept,

3621
02:51:01,170 --> 02:51:02,003
she kept,
she kept experimenting and she started 

3622
02:51:04,501 --> 02:51:06,330
to add things back and take them away.

3623
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:08,820
And sometimes when she added things,
the results were devastating.

3624
02:51:08,821 --> 02:51:11,250
She was like done for a month.
She eat the wrong thing,

3625
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:13,890
done for a month.
All the symptoms came back.

3626
02:51:13,891 --> 02:51:14,724
The depression came back.
She thought that her whole dietary 

3627
02:51:16,711 --> 02:51:18,800
theory was wrong because it lasted so 
long,

3628
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:22,250
so extreme and it's like,
it took her two years to figure out that

3629
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:25,470
really what she could eat was beef and 
greens and then she figured out that she

3630
02:51:25,471 --> 02:51:28,680
could only eat beef.
So greens themselves.

3631
02:51:28,710 --> 02:51:29,461
Well,
look.

3632
02:51:29,461 --> 02:51:30,450
So what happened?
Happened.

3633
02:51:30,451 --> 02:51:32,640
Okay.
So two years ago she said,

3634
02:51:32,641 --> 02:51:33,474
dad,
you have tried this diet because you 

3635
02:51:34,411 --> 02:51:37,650
have a lot of the same symptoms as me.
now I didn't have arthritis,

3636
02:51:37,651 --> 02:51:39,960
but I had a lot of the other symptoms 
and I thought,

3637
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:41,940
oh christ,
okay mckayla,

3638
02:51:42,180 --> 02:51:44,100
I can try anything for a month.
She said,

3639
02:51:44,101 --> 02:51:45,420
try it for a month.
I thought,

3640
02:51:45,421 --> 02:51:46,170
okay,
whatever.

3641
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:48,810
I can hang by my fingernails from the 
window sill for a month.

3642
02:51:48,811 --> 02:51:50,910
It's like,
it's just not that big a deal.

3643
02:51:51,330 --> 02:51:53,100
And so I,
I eliminated.

3644
02:51:53,190 --> 02:51:55,230
I went on really low carb diet.
Okay,

3645
02:51:55,231 --> 02:51:56,064
so this is what happened.
I had gastric reflux disorder and I was 

3646
02:52:00,571 --> 02:52:03,900
snoring quite a lot.
I stopped snoring the first week.

3647
02:52:04,620 --> 02:52:05,453
I thought,
what the hell that supposed to be 

3648
02:52:07,061 --> 02:52:09,970
associated with weight loss because I 
had gained some weight.

3649
02:52:09,971 --> 02:52:11,920
I weighed about 212 pounds and I'm what?
six?

3650
02:52:11,921 --> 02:52:13,570
One and a half,
so that was my maximum weight,

3651
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:15,393
stopped snoring,
which was a great relief to tammy that 

3652
02:52:17,381 --> 02:52:18,820
just quit and that's a big deal,
right?

3653
02:52:18,821 --> 02:52:19,654
Because if you snore,
you have sleep apnea and then you don't 

3654
02:52:20,801 --> 02:52:21,350
sleep.
right.

3655
02:52:21,350 --> 02:52:23,110
It's like not a good thing.
Okay.

3656
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:26,050
Next I started waking up in the 
mornings.

3657
02:52:26,110 --> 02:52:28,630
I'd never been able to wake up in the 
mornings my whole life.

3658
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:29,523
I always had to stumble to the shower 
and then maybe I could wake up and took 

3659
02:52:32,411 --> 02:52:35,890
me an hour and I felt terrible and so 
all of a sudden I woke up,

3660
02:52:35,891 --> 02:52:36,724
but it was like,
oh,

3661
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:37,863
look at that.
I'm awake in the morning and I'm 

3662
02:52:38,870 --> 02:52:41,440
clearheaded and things aren't gloomy and
horrible.

3663
02:52:41,441 --> 02:52:41,981
It's like,
well,

3664
02:52:41,981 --> 02:52:45,100
isn't that weird?
Then I lost seven pounds the first month

3665
02:52:45,460 --> 02:52:46,293
I thought seven pounds.
That's a lot in a month and I'd already 

3666
02:52:48,671 --> 02:52:49,504
gone for a whole year on a sugar free 
diet and I didn't lose any weight and 

3667
02:52:51,881 --> 02:52:54,370
I'd been exercised sugar free,
but did you cut out bread?

3668
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:55,200
no.
No.

3669
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:56,860
It was just no desserts,
no sugar,

3670
02:52:56,890 --> 02:52:58,090
no,
and I thought that might do.

3671
02:52:58,091 --> 02:53:00,190
It didn't make any difference at all.
Seven pounds.

3672
02:53:01,570 --> 02:53:04,270
Well then then I lost seven pounds in 
the next month.

3673
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:07,240
Then I lost seven pounds.
The next month I lost seven pounds every

3674
02:53:07,241 --> 02:53:08,260
month for seven months.

3675
02:53:08,260 --> 02:53:09,093
Like I'd throw away all my clothes.
I went back to the same weight that I 

3676
02:53:10,961 --> 02:53:11,794
was when I was 26 and my psoriasis 
disappeared and I had floaters in my 

3677
02:53:16,151 --> 02:53:20,410
right eye and they cleared up and then 
the last thing that went away from me,

3678
02:53:20,411 --> 02:53:21,244
I was still having a bitch of a time 
with mood regulation and that sucked 

3679
02:53:23,321 --> 02:53:24,154
because when I changed my diet,
I didn't respond to antidepressants 

3680
02:53:26,140 --> 02:53:26,973
properly anymore.
They weren't working and so although I 

3681
02:53:28,841 --> 02:53:31,360
was getting better physically on a 
variety of ways,

3682
02:53:31,361 --> 02:53:32,194
like radical ways,
I was really having a bitch of a time 

3683
02:53:35,141 --> 02:53:37,270
regulating my mood and I was having 
sporadic,

3684
02:53:37,271 --> 02:53:40,480
really negative reactions to food when I
ate something I shouldn't.

3685
02:53:40,630 --> 02:53:41,463
So that took about a year and a half to 
clear up and I was still really anxious 

3686
02:53:43,961 --> 02:53:46,420
in the morning up to three months ago,
like horribly,

3687
02:53:46,421 --> 02:53:47,770
and then it would get better all day.

3688
02:53:47,950 --> 02:53:48,581
People said,
well,

3689
02:53:48,581 --> 02:53:49,990
you're under a lot of stress.
And I thought,

3690
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:50,891
yeah,
yeah.

3691
02:53:50,891 --> 02:53:52,930
I've been under a lot of stress for like
10 years.

3692
02:53:52,931 --> 02:53:53,764
It's like it's a lot,
but it Wasn't any more stressful than 

3693
02:53:56,261 --> 02:53:57,910
helping my daughter deal with her 
illness.

3694
02:53:57,911 --> 02:54:00,130
That's for sure that no,
this is something different.

3695
02:54:00,610 --> 02:54:04,090
and she saId to me quit eating greens 
and I thought,

3696
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:05,800
oh really?
Jesus mckayla,

3697
02:54:05,830 --> 02:54:08,530
meeting cucumbers,
lettuce,

3698
02:54:08,770 --> 02:54:12,600
broccoli and chicken and beef.
It's like I have to cut out the god damn

3699
02:54:12,601 --> 02:54:15,010
greens,
just like try it for a month.

3700
02:54:15,490 --> 02:54:16,323
Okay.
Within a week I was 25 percent less 

3701
02:54:20,441 --> 02:54:22,030
anxious in the morning,
within two weeks,

3702
02:54:22,031 --> 02:54:24,670
75 percent.
And I've been better every single day.

3703
02:54:24,790 --> 02:54:25,623
I'm better now probably than I've ever 
been in my life and I haven't been 

3704
02:54:27,761 --> 02:54:31,420
taking antidepressants for a whole year,
so I don't know what.

3705
02:54:31,421 --> 02:54:34,570
And I weighed 162 pounds like I have.
No,

3706
02:54:35,130 --> 02:54:35,963
I'm,
I'm and I've actually gained 

3707
02:54:37,091 --> 02:54:37,924
musculature.

3708
02:54:38,350 --> 02:54:40,180
I've been doing some working out,
but not a lot.

3709
02:54:40,690 --> 02:54:44,170
And so I can sleep six hours a night.
no problem.

3710
02:54:44,171 --> 02:54:45,610
I wake up in the morning,
I'm awake.

3711
02:54:45,611 --> 02:54:46,444
If I take a 15 minute nap.
That used to take me an hour to recover 

3712
02:54:48,521 --> 02:54:49,480
from,
that's gone.

3713
02:54:49,630 --> 02:54:54,010
Here's the coolest thing.
I've had gum disease since I was 25.

3714
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:55,033
That's been serious enough to have.
I've had to have minor surgical 

3715
02:54:57,191 --> 02:54:59,980
intervention scraping and that sort of 
thing to keep it at bay.

3716
02:55:00,430 --> 02:55:01,263
It's gone.
I checked with my dentist before this 

3717
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:04,790
last tour,
no inflammation.

3718
02:55:05,380 --> 02:55:07,530
And that's associated with heart disease
by the way,

3719
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:08,593
gum inflammation and ginger vidas.
It's a good risk factor for heart 

3720
02:55:10,581 --> 02:55:11,414
disease.
It means the systemic inflammation is 

3721
02:55:12,411 --> 02:55:13,244
gone and it's not supposed to happen.
You're not supposed to recover from 

3722
02:55:15,921 --> 02:55:18,290
ginger bitus have my gums are in perfect
shape.

3723
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:20,300
It's like,
what the hell?

3724
02:55:20,301 --> 02:55:22,310
So here's what happened.
I lost 50 pounds.

3725
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:25,610
That's a lot,
right?

3726
02:55:26,450 --> 02:55:28,040
I'm nowhere near as hungry as I used to 
be.

3727
02:55:28,041 --> 02:55:29,960
My appetite's probably fallen by 70 
percent.

3728
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:33,410
I don't get blood sugar dysregulation.
Problems.

3729
02:55:35,060 --> 02:55:37,760
I need way less sleep.
I get up in the morning and I'm fine.

3730
02:55:37,880 --> 02:55:39,260
I'm not anxious.
I'm not depressed.

3731
02:55:39,261 --> 02:55:42,980
I don't have psoriasis.
My legs were numb on the sides.

3732
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:43,843
That's gone.
I'm certainly intellectually at my best 

3733
02:55:49,241 --> 02:55:50,740
at the moment,
which is a great relief.

3734
02:55:50,741 --> 02:55:53,530
Especially doing this tour.
Depression is gone.

3735
02:55:55,450 --> 02:55:57,040
I'm stronger,
I can swim better

3736
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:02,870
and my gum disease is gone.
It's like,

3737
02:56:02,871 --> 02:56:04,520
what the hell?
And you've done.

3738
02:56:04,640 --> 02:56:08,680
You've done no blood work so you don't 
know what your lippert lipid profile is.

3739
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:10,190
No.
I'll get that done again when I go back.

3740
02:56:10,230 --> 02:56:11,390
Take any vitamins.
Nope.

3741
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:14,360
No,
I eat beef and salt and water.

3742
02:56:14,690 --> 02:56:17,660
That's it.
And I never cheat ever.

3743
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:19,820
Not even a little bit.
No soda,

3744
02:56:19,821 --> 02:56:23,440
no wine drink club soda.
Well that's done.

3745
02:56:23,650 --> 02:56:24,950
It's still water.
Well,

3746
02:56:25,010 --> 02:56:26,720
you know when you're down to that level 
though,

3747
02:56:26,721 --> 02:56:27,554
it's not joe joe.
There's there's club soda which is 

3748
02:56:30,411 --> 02:56:32,030
really bubbly.
There's perrier,

3749
02:56:32,031 --> 02:56:35,030
which is sort of bubbly.
There's flatwater and there's hot water.

3750
02:56:36,670 --> 02:56:38,880
Those distinctions start to become 
important.

3751
02:56:38,890 --> 02:56:41,900
It's crazy where we ate last night and I
ate what you ate.

3752
02:56:42,180 --> 02:56:45,320
Just a.
We both had that giant tomahawk.

3753
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:46,910
I had wine though.
Yeah.

3754
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:49,790
I'm.
I'm curious about thIs.

3755
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:54,050
I'm very curious to try it,
but I eat a lot of vegetables,

3756
02:56:54,410 --> 02:56:56,330
but I don't have any problems like 
health.

3757
02:56:56,660 --> 02:56:59,570
Hey man.
Like I'm not a disclaimer.

3758
02:56:59,571 --> 02:57:02,450
Number two,
I am not recommending this to anyone.

3759
02:57:02,870 --> 02:57:04,100
However,
I have had,

3760
02:57:04,580 --> 02:57:06,170
however,
I have had many,

3761
02:57:06,171 --> 02:57:09,230
many people come up to me on the tour 
and say,

3762
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:11,120
look,
I've been following your daughter's blog

3763
02:57:11,390 --> 02:57:14,710
and I've lost 100 pounds.
I think what?

3764
02:57:14,780 --> 02:57:17,720
you lost a hundred pounds.
I lost a hundred pounds in six months.

3765
02:57:17,721 --> 02:57:20,180
I talked to a woman yesterday.
She lost 15 pounds in one month.

3766
02:57:20,181 --> 02:57:22,160
She was 70.
It's like,

3767
02:57:22,340 --> 02:57:25,610
this is.
Here's a question.

3768
02:57:25,820 --> 02:57:27,800
Why is everyone fat and stupid?

3769
02:57:29,080 --> 02:57:30,310
That's a question,
man,

3770
02:57:31,180 --> 02:57:33,030
because it's new.
Is it?

3771
02:57:33,590 --> 02:57:34,191
Yes,
it is.

3772
02:57:34,191 --> 02:57:35,024
It's new and it's not sedentary 
lifestyle that that hypothesis doesn't 

3773
02:57:38,661 --> 02:57:39,494
seem to hold water.
There's something wrong with the way 

3774
02:57:41,271 --> 02:57:42,104
we're eating and the.
What's wrong is that we're eating way 

3775
02:57:43,791 --> 02:57:45,740
too many carbohydrates.
I think

3776
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:47,393
no expat shift,
the elimination of most carbohydrates 

3777
02:57:50,231 --> 02:57:51,064
lives made a big shift in my life and I 
do cheat occasionally with bread and 

3778
02:57:55,331 --> 02:57:56,164
occasionally with pasta I will.
I will go off with ice cream and things 

3779
02:57:59,981 --> 02:58:00,814
along those lines,
but most of the time I'm just eating 

3780
02:58:03,721 --> 02:58:07,680
meat and vegetables most of the time and
then I'll have a cheat day,

3781
02:58:07,681 --> 02:58:10,860
like once a week or something like that.
Especially if I go to dinner,

3782
02:58:10,861 --> 02:58:14,370
I'll have a little pasta and it doesn't 
seem to mess me up too bad,

3783
02:58:14,371 --> 02:58:18,990
but I do feel shitty after I do it.
It's like for simple mouth pleasure.

3784
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:22,380
I'm allowing myself to feel tired 
afterwards.

3785
02:58:22,730 --> 02:58:23,990
Yeah,
that's a big one man.

3786
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:25,050
Yeah.
But like I.

3787
02:58:25,220 --> 02:58:26,660
Yeah.
Well really I.

3788
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:29,333
And it's so interesting too,
like I can't believe I can wake up in 

3789
02:58:32,091 --> 02:58:32,924
the morning.
I get that's never happened to me in my 

3790
02:58:34,851 --> 02:58:37,190
whole life in when I was a kid.
13,

3791
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:38,113
12,
had a bitch of a time waking up in the 

3792
02:58:39,501 --> 02:58:41,180
morning.
It was just brutal.

3793
02:58:41,780 --> 02:58:43,700
I just thought that's how it was.
This is what

3794
02:58:43,780 --> 02:58:44,613
I mean.
Again,

3795
02:58:44,660 --> 02:58:45,493
I'm not a nutritionist either,
but what's fascinating to me is I 

3796
02:58:48,231 --> 02:58:51,170
haven't heard any negative stories about
people doing this.

3797
02:58:52,180 --> 02:58:53,950
Have a negative story.
Okay.

3798
02:58:54,310 --> 02:58:55,143
One of the things that both mckayla and 
I noticed was that when we restricted 

3799
02:58:59,621 --> 02:59:02,320
our diet and then eat something,
we weren't supposed to,

3800
02:59:02,321 --> 02:59:06,370
the reaction to eating what we weren't 
supposed to was absolutely catastrophic.

3801
02:59:06,930 --> 02:59:07,763
Would it show?
What did you switch to or what did you 

3802
02:59:09,221 --> 02:59:10,160
eat rather?
Um,

3803
02:59:10,570 --> 02:59:11,403
well,
the worst response I think we're 

3804
02:59:12,371 --> 02:59:14,590
allergic to or allergic,
whatever the hell this is.

3805
02:59:14,591 --> 02:59:15,424
Having an inflammatory response to 
something called sulfites and we had 

3806
02:59:19,001 --> 02:59:22,540
some apple cider that had sulfites in it
and that was really not good.

3807
02:59:22,541 --> 02:59:23,374
Like I was done for a month.
That was the first time I talked to sam 

3808
02:59:25,541 --> 02:59:27,280
harris.
You were done for a month.

3809
02:59:27,370 --> 02:59:28,660
Oh yeah.
It took me out for a month.

3810
02:59:28,661 --> 02:59:30,040
It was awful.
Really?

3811
02:59:30,041 --> 02:59:30,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

3812
02:59:30,810 --> 02:59:35,180
So and so this is right before this 
whole truth conversation with sam harris

3813
02:59:35,181 --> 02:59:36,240
had dirt and the mud

3814
02:59:36,670 --> 02:59:40,560
during the day I talked to sam was like 
the worst day of my life,

3815
02:59:40,740 --> 02:59:43,830
not because of talking to sam,
but it was just physical.

3816
02:59:43,831 --> 02:59:45,330
Oh jesus,
I was so dead,

3817
02:59:45,331 --> 02:59:48,200
but I didn't want to not do it.
Because cider like,

3818
02:59:48,210 --> 02:59:49,470
well,
what was it fights in?

3819
02:59:49,530 --> 02:59:51,320
What was it doing to you?
Oh it,

3820
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:52,173
it.
It produced an overwhelming sense of 

3821
02:59:54,421 --> 02:59:57,780
impending doom and I seriously been 
overwhelming,

3822
02:59:57,810 --> 02:59:58,643
like there's no way I could've lived 
like that if that would have lasted for 

3823
03:00:01,360 --> 03:00:03,180
seeding.
Mckayla knew by that point that it would

3824
03:00:03,181 --> 03:00:08,181
probably only last a month and I was 
like a month to month fucking cider or I

3825
03:00:08,311 --> 03:00:11,610
didn't sleep that month.
I didn't sleep for 25 days.

3826
03:00:11,970 --> 03:00:14,850
I didn't sleep at all.
I didn't sleep at all for 25 days.

3827
03:00:14,851 --> 03:00:16,670
How that possible?
The all county,

3828
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:17,513
how it's possible you lay in bed frozen 
in something approximating terror for 

3829
03:00:22,111 --> 03:00:23,460
eight hours and then you get up.

3830
03:00:23,520 --> 03:00:24,630
Oh my god.
Yeah.

3831
03:00:25,030 --> 03:00:28,170
This is some fucking cider from sites.
What we thought,

3832
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:30,690
yeah,
I mean look again,

3833
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:33,030
I don't know what the hell I'm talking 
about.

3834
03:00:33,630 --> 03:00:35,220
Okay.
This is all a mystery to me.

3835
03:00:35,940 --> 03:00:37,860
The fact that my daughter was so sick.
See,

3836
03:00:37,861 --> 03:00:38,694
the one thing that I did know,
because I scoured the literature on 

3837
03:00:40,501 --> 03:00:44,280
arthritis when she was a kid,
the scientific literature and because we

3838
03:00:44,281 --> 03:00:45,114
were interested in the dietary 
connection and the only thing I could 

3839
03:00:47,101 --> 03:00:50,730
find that was reliable was that if 
people with arthritis fasted,

3840
03:00:51,150 --> 03:00:51,983
their symptoms reliably went away.
Now it's actually a well documented 

3841
03:00:54,511 --> 03:00:55,344
finding,
but then if they started to eat again 

3842
03:00:57,930 --> 03:00:59,500
and there was symptoms came back,
I thought,

3843
03:00:59,501 --> 03:01:00,334
well,
what the hell does it not matter what 

3844
03:01:02,381 --> 03:01:04,810
they eat?
They can't be reactive to everything.

3845
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:06,970
It's like,
no,

3846
03:01:06,971 --> 03:01:07,804
but they can be reactive to almost 
everything and the difference between 

3847
03:01:10,871 --> 03:01:12,220
everything and almost everything.

3848
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:13,083
That's a big difference and so mckayla 
seems to be maybe me too and tammy's on 

3849
03:01:17,471 --> 03:01:18,304
the same diet because she has autoimmune
problems on her side of the family and 

3850
03:01:20,521 --> 03:01:22,330
so mckayla seemed to inherit all of 
them.

3851
03:01:22,570 --> 03:01:24,550
Your skin looks better.
Oh jesus.

3852
03:01:24,551 --> 03:01:26,630
Joe,
I'm waiting you.

3853
03:01:26,770 --> 03:01:30,010
You look like more vibrant.
It's very strange.

3854
03:01:31,060 --> 03:01:35,360
You're welcome,
but my point is you're saying that there

3855
03:01:35,361 --> 03:01:37,960
is a.
There is problems with his diet,

3856
03:01:37,961 --> 03:01:39,620
but that doesn't seem to be a problem 
with the dyads.

3857
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:40,473
He was a problem with deviating from the
diet that your body becomes accustomed 

3858
03:01:43,001 --> 03:01:43,571
with.
well,

3859
03:01:43,571 --> 03:01:46,300
one of the hypothesis that we've been 
pursuing,

3860
03:01:46,301 --> 03:01:49,060
and there's some justification for this 
in the scientific literature,

3861
03:01:49,061 --> 03:01:49,894
is that the reason that you lay on 
layers of fat because the fat acts as a 

3862
03:01:53,830 --> 03:01:54,663
buffer between you and the toxic things 
that you're eating because fat is 

3863
03:01:57,461 --> 03:01:58,210
actually an organ.

3864
03:01:58,210 --> 03:02:02,050
It has functions other than merely the 
storage of of of calories,

3865
03:02:02,350 --> 03:02:04,870
and maybe when you strip out that 
protective layer,

3866
03:02:05,140 --> 03:02:07,450
then you're more sensitive to what you 
shouldn't be eating.

3867
03:02:07,540 --> 03:02:10,150
This is all speculative hypotheses,
right?

3868
03:02:10,450 --> 03:02:14,090
Or maybe you sensitize yourself by 
removing it from your constant diet.

3869
03:02:14,150 --> 03:02:15,550
I don't bloody well know.
Well,

3870
03:02:15,551 --> 03:02:16,384
I would think it would be much more 
likely that because you think about 

3871
03:02:18,281 --> 03:02:21,310
people who are alcoholics,
they develop a tolerance to alcohol.

3872
03:02:21,311 --> 03:02:24,850
You get off of that and then you have a 
drink and your tolerances are shot,

3873
03:02:24,851 --> 03:02:28,340
and then you immediately have a adverse 
reaction to the alcohol.

3874
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:31,660
Same thing with marijuana.
When people do it all the time,

3875
03:02:31,730 --> 03:02:33,340
your body becomes tolerant.
Well,

3876
03:02:33,341 --> 03:02:34,174
I think,
I think that the layering of fat on 

3877
03:02:36,341 --> 03:02:38,650
might be part of the tolerance 
mechanism,

3878
03:02:39,460 --> 03:02:41,770
so it's not merely a matter of caloric 
intake.

3879
03:02:41,771 --> 03:02:44,530
It's a matter of of toxic caloric 
intake,

3880
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:48,610
buffered by whatever it is that fat is 
doing as a neuroendocrin Oregon.

3881
03:02:49,330 --> 03:02:50,360
But again,
like I said,

3882
03:02:50,361 --> 03:02:52,500
I said I'm out of my depth here,
but you know,

3883
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:53,343
the whole,
everyone's out of their depth that god 

3884
03:02:55,261 --> 03:02:58,000
damn food pyramid was made by the 
department of agriculture,

3885
03:02:58,001 --> 03:02:58,834
not the department of health.
It wasn't predicated on any scientific 

3886
03:03:00,851 --> 03:03:02,420
studies whatsoever.
We should have,

3887
03:03:02,460 --> 03:03:05,230
we shouldn't be eating massive 
quantities of corn syrup.

3888
03:03:05,231 --> 03:03:06,064
We eat,
we eat way too many carbohydrates with 

3889
03:03:08,860 --> 03:03:12,130
mckayla posted a paper the other day,
a doctor,

3890
03:03:12,131 --> 03:03:12,964
uh,
successfully treated type one diabetes 

3891
03:03:14,231 --> 03:03:18,040
with a carnivore diet type one,
not type two.

3892
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:21,330
So that's bloody impressive.
Yeah,

3893
03:03:21,380 --> 03:03:22,213
it's,
it's very curious to me because you're 

3894
03:03:24,881 --> 03:03:25,714
talking about one adverse reaction,
which is when you deviated from the 

3895
03:03:28,361 --> 03:03:29,194
diet.
What I'm talking about is when I read 

3896
03:03:30,761 --> 03:03:35,761
people's accounts of trying this diet,
it's almost universally positive,

3897
03:03:36,520 --> 03:03:37,550
but again,
that's a problem.

3898
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:39,670
Well,
it's probably anecdote,

3899
03:03:39,671 --> 03:03:40,171
right?
I mean,

3900
03:03:40,171 --> 03:03:43,960
I'm not sure and it's the same with all 
these stories that I'm collecting as I'm

3901
03:03:43,961 --> 03:03:45,820
touring people.

3902
03:03:45,910 --> 03:03:47,440
Lots of people have come up to me and 
said,

3903
03:03:47,441 --> 03:03:48,274
look,
I lost 45 pounds in the last three 

3904
03:03:49,241 --> 03:03:50,630
months.
I think.

3905
03:03:50,800 --> 03:03:52,990
Yeah,
I think it's shocking to me.

3906
03:03:52,991 --> 03:03:53,824
I think,
well,

3907
03:03:54,270 --> 03:03:55,210
what do you make of that?
And say,

3908
03:03:55,211 --> 03:03:56,110
well,
I can't believe it.

3909
03:03:56,260 --> 03:03:57,830
Well,
who can all couldn't believe it?

3910
03:03:58,280 --> 03:03:59,750
50 pounds.
It's like,

3911
03:03:59,900 --> 03:04:02,180
first of all,
I didn't know I had 50 pounds to lose,

3912
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:03,133
you know,
I thought I was maybe 20 pounds heavier 

3913
03:04:04,371 --> 03:04:06,170
than I should have been.
Should have been won 85,

3914
03:04:06,171 --> 03:04:09,410
something like that.
I Guess that's 25 to 30 pounds.

3915
03:04:09,590 --> 03:04:11,420
That was the maximum I thought.
No,

3916
03:04:11,421 --> 03:04:11,991
no,
I lost.

3917
03:04:11,991 --> 03:04:15,080
I met one 62 and I was at 2:12.
So what's that?

3918
03:04:16,340 --> 03:04:19,280
50 50 balance.
Has a lot of weight.

3919
03:04:19,550 --> 03:04:21,440
Jesus.
I threw all my clothes away.

3920
03:04:22,360 --> 03:04:23,960
It's.
I can't believe it.

3921
03:04:24,010 --> 03:04:25,520
When I was nine,
I was like,

3922
03:04:25,521 --> 03:04:26,660
you're so slim.

3923
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:27,793
Like your.
Your stomach is completely flat and 

3924
03:04:29,901 --> 03:04:31,100
it's.
And this is not a lean,

3925
03:04:31,101 --> 03:04:35,480
mean fighting man in.
you're not a an exercise fanatic.

3926
03:04:35,481 --> 03:04:38,040
It's not like you're starving yourself.
It's not like you're going,

3927
03:04:38,050 --> 03:04:38,883
I'm not having fun.
That's another thing I should say to 

3928
03:04:40,281 --> 03:04:42,650
people.
If you want to try a diet like this,

3929
03:04:43,220 --> 03:04:45,620
you eat enough meat and fat so you are 
not hungry.

3930
03:04:46,040 --> 03:04:47,240
Okay?
You can't get hungry.

3931
03:04:47,450 --> 03:04:48,800
You're not eating enough.
If you're hungry,

3932
03:04:49,250 --> 03:04:50,083
if you're hungry,
you're going to cheat and it's gonna 

3933
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:51,913
drive you stark raving mad.
The other thing that was really cool is 

3934
03:04:54,111 --> 03:04:55,490
like,
I really liked sweets,

3935
03:04:55,640 --> 03:04:58,370
like I've kind of lived on peanut butter
sandwiches and chocolate milk.

3936
03:04:58,430 --> 03:04:59,480
Not,
not really,

3937
03:04:59,750 --> 03:05:01,490
but that was my go to food,
you know,

3938
03:05:01,910 --> 03:05:06,910
both of which were terrible for me,
but after I stopped eating carbohydrates

3939
03:05:07,371 --> 03:05:10,250
for a month,
the carbohydrate cravings went away.

3940
03:05:10,870 --> 03:05:12,350
You know,
last night when we were out for dinner,

3941
03:05:12,351 --> 03:05:13,184
somebody ordered bread pudding and I 
bloody love bread pudding with caramel 

3942
03:05:15,801 --> 03:05:16,634
and ice cream,
so it was sitting there and I could 

3943
03:05:18,171 --> 03:05:22,370
smell it and I thought I could go all 
fantastic Mr.

3944
03:05:22,370 --> 03:05:26,240
Fox on that bread pudding and just tear 
it down in about 15 seconds,

3945
03:05:26,420 --> 03:05:27,253
but it wasn't,
it wasn't as intense as a craving for a 

3946
03:05:29,001 --> 03:05:32,330
cigarette if you're next ex smoker.
It was like be really nice to eat that.

3947
03:05:32,660 --> 03:05:36,050
But like my appetite declined by about 
75 percent.

3948
03:05:36,100 --> 03:05:37,700
That's been permanent.
That's been.

3949
03:05:37,730 --> 03:05:38,563
So there's a perverse thing for you.
I eat way less and now I'm not as 

3950
03:05:41,301 --> 03:05:43,160
hungry.
Okay.

3951
03:05:43,570 --> 03:05:44,990
Well how does that make sense?
Well,

3952
03:05:44,991 --> 03:05:45,824
you're not eating way less eating way 
less thing because you had a 30 ounce 

3953
03:05:48,921 --> 03:05:49,970
steak last night.
yes,

3954
03:05:49,971 --> 03:05:50,640
yes.
I'm,

3955
03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:53,210
I'm doing my best not to be hungry.

3956
03:05:53,210 --> 03:05:54,830
Although it didn't look like it was $30.
No,

3957
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:56,030
no,
no.

3958
03:05:56,090 --> 03:05:57,710
It was a small 30 state.
Well,

3959
03:05:57,711 --> 03:05:59,780
I think it starts out 30 ounces before 
they cook.

3960
03:05:59,781 --> 03:06:01,820
It loses a considerable.
Right.

3961
03:06:02,020 --> 03:06:02,980
Very fatty.
Right.

3962
03:06:03,500 --> 03:06:07,070
But that's the other thing to you.
You must have to get a lot of fat.

3963
03:06:07,510 --> 03:06:08,343
I eat fatty cuts of steak and mckayla is
buying directly from the butcher store 

3964
03:06:12,591 --> 03:06:13,424
and we cook that up,
cut it into small pieces and fried up 

3965
03:06:15,401 --> 03:06:16,680
until it's crispy.
Wow.

3966
03:06:16,690 --> 03:06:20,810
It's actually quite delicious.
It's not bread pudding with ice cream,

3967
03:06:20,811 --> 03:06:22,690
but it's funny.
You mean daniel?

3968
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:23,840
It's so ridiculous.
I want to.

3969
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:24,913
I want your blood profile.
I want to find out what's going on with 

3970
03:06:26,961 --> 03:06:27,794
you because one of the big myths,
misconceptions when it comes to 

3971
03:06:30,081 --> 03:06:30,914
cholesterol and saturated fat and food 
is that if you eat dietary cholesterol 

3972
03:06:35,001 --> 03:06:37,280
that it affects your blood cholesterol 
levels.

3973
03:06:37,280 --> 03:06:40,160
It's not super common.
Misconceptions.

3974
03:06:40,190 --> 03:06:42,620
Well those.
So the thing about clinical studies with

3975
03:06:42,621 --> 03:06:45,500
diet are virtually impossible to conduct
because you just can't.

3976
03:06:45,710 --> 03:06:50,710
you can't conduct a proper randomly 
distributed controlled experiment is too

3977
03:06:50,781 --> 03:06:51,614
hard,
so a lot of what we're trying to do is 

3978
03:06:52,581 --> 03:06:55,150
pull out information from correlations,
right?

3979
03:06:55,490 --> 03:06:56,323
He can't do it,
which is one of the real problems with 

3980
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:58,673
correlating meet with cancer and 
diabetes and all these different 

3981
03:07:01,711 --> 03:07:04,320
diseases is because people are eating a 
bunch of shit with that.

3982
03:07:04,830 --> 03:07:05,663
They have different lifestyle profile,
like there's just endless numbers of 

3983
03:07:08,701 --> 03:07:12,440
confounding variables and you only need 
one confounding variable that's,

3984
03:07:12,500 --> 03:07:13,333
that's relevant to screw up the study.
You can't get that information with 

3985
03:07:16,321 --> 03:07:19,170
correlational studies.
We try because it's impossible to do the

3986
03:07:19,171 --> 03:07:21,060
studies,
but how many people were incredulous?

3987
03:07:21,530 --> 03:07:22,363
We went,
how manY people when they're hearing 

3988
03:07:23,701 --> 03:07:25,230
about this,
everybody,

3989
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:27,900
everybody,
while you are not,

3990
03:07:27,901 --> 03:07:29,430
but you know you're interested in this 
sort of thing,

3991
03:07:29,431 --> 03:07:30,630
but they should be incredulous.

3992
03:07:30,630 --> 03:07:32,610
Like when people make absurd claims,
it's like,

3993
03:07:32,640 --> 03:07:33,473
oh well I had 50 health problems and I 
stopped eating everything but meat and 

3994
03:07:35,970 --> 03:07:36,840
they went away.
It's like,

3995
03:07:36,841 --> 03:07:38,160
oh sure.
It's like,

3996
03:07:38,161 --> 03:07:38,994
yeah,
well it wasn't you dying so and I see 

3997
03:07:43,351 --> 03:07:44,184
the results and I know it's an anecdote.
I bloody will understand that and I'm 

3998
03:07:46,891 --> 03:07:47,724
highly skeptical about all of this,
but I'm telling you so that's why I'm 

3999
03:07:50,371 --> 03:07:51,204
telling you what happened to me and what
happened to my daughter and also what 

4000
03:07:52,891 --> 03:07:56,430
happened to my wife because she's.
Tammy was always in good shape and she's

4001
03:07:56,431 --> 03:08:01,431
exercised a lot and she reduced to the,
to the pure carnivore died about a month

4002
03:08:02,490 --> 03:08:03,323
ago.
She lost like 12 pounds and she was 

4003
03:08:05,281 --> 03:08:06,114
already slim.
She's back to the same way she was when 

4004
03:08:07,861 --> 03:08:10,270
she was 21.
She's,

4005
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:13,080
she's like 58,
you know,

4006
03:08:13,290 --> 03:08:15,420
and she doesn't look 58.
I can tell you that.

4007
03:08:16,400 --> 03:08:19,530
So it's really fascinating.
It's really fascinating because I just,

4008
03:08:19,531 --> 03:08:20,364
I,
as a person who studied diet for many 

4009
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:25,673
years,
I would assume that you need fido 

4010
03:08:26,721 --> 03:08:27,554
nutrients.
I would assume that you need vitamin 

4011
03:08:29,391 --> 03:08:30,224
supplements like vitamin c for example.
It turns out if you don't eat 

4012
03:08:32,371 --> 03:08:34,140
carbohydrates,
you don't need vitamin c.

4013
03:08:34,260 --> 03:08:35,330
Huh?
Who would have guessed?

4014
03:08:35,370 --> 03:08:37,020
How's that work?
I don't.

4015
03:08:37,110 --> 03:08:39,150
I don't remember mckayla outline to 
paper.

4016
03:08:39,151 --> 03:08:42,600
For me vitamin c is necessary for 
carbohydrate metabolism,

4017
03:08:42,810 --> 03:08:44,730
but if you don't,
if again,

4018
03:08:44,880 --> 03:08:47,910
remember everyone listening.
I am not an expert in this field,

4019
03:08:48,750 --> 03:08:49,770
so,
um,

4020
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:50,753
but,
but I want you to get your blood tested 

4021
03:08:52,470 --> 03:08:53,280
because I think,
yeah,

4022
03:08:53,280 --> 03:08:56,640
if be pretty funny.
If it was in good shape,

4023
03:08:56,730 --> 03:08:57,900
Yeah,
it would be.

4024
03:08:58,530 --> 03:09:01,080
I'd like to find out what your nutrient 
levels are and where they're coming.

4025
03:09:01,090 --> 03:09:01,651
Yeah,
I mean,

4026
03:09:01,651 --> 03:09:02,470
what,
what,

4027
03:09:02,470 --> 03:09:03,303
how much?
I'm getting a little getting a little 

4028
03:09:04,321 --> 03:09:05,154
cramping in my toes from time to time,
so I'm not sure about potassium or 

4029
03:09:08,071 --> 03:09:08,700
magnesium.

4030
03:09:08,700 --> 03:09:11,520
That's a possibility.
That's how the supplement.

4031
03:09:11,850 --> 03:09:14,160
It's very easy,
which is why I'm concerned about.

4032
03:09:14,480 --> 03:09:15,313
And also minerals and certain minerals 
You're getting from vegetables that 

4033
03:09:18,751 --> 03:09:20,370
you're probably not getting.
Yup.

4034
03:09:20,610 --> 03:09:22,410
Well this is all like,
look,

4035
03:09:22,411 --> 03:09:24,450
it seems hard to supplement that stuff 
though.

4036
03:09:24,451 --> 03:09:25,980
Colloidal minerals,
you know,

4037
03:09:25,981 --> 03:09:28,500
there's some mineral pills you can take 
plenty of.

4038
03:09:28,580 --> 03:09:29,413
Well there are people,
there are people who basically lived on 

4039
03:09:31,381 --> 03:09:32,760
meat.
You know,

4040
03:09:32,761 --> 03:09:36,420
the inuit did was.
I basically did some supplementation,

4041
03:09:36,421 --> 03:09:37,680
but not a lot.
Yeah.

4042
03:09:38,430 --> 03:09:40,260
And apparently if you do a carnivore 
diet,

4043
03:09:40,261 --> 03:09:42,630
you're supposed to eat more organ meat 
and I do some of that,

4044
03:09:42,631 --> 03:09:45,150
but not a lot.
But I can tell you like I'm,

4045
03:09:45,450 --> 03:09:47,610
I'm in.
Well look,

4046
03:09:47,611 --> 03:09:50,370
I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't 
producing positive results.

4047
03:09:50,580 --> 03:09:53,350
It's not like it's fun for a while.
Well,

4048
03:09:53,351 --> 03:09:57,250
it makes you a social pariah.
Let's invite the peterson's over.

4049
03:09:57,310 --> 03:09:58,720
Oh yeah.
they don't eat anything.

4050
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:00,160
Oh,
we have other friends.

4051
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:02,110
Was like,
well that's how it works.

4052
03:10:02,111 --> 03:10:04,000
It's not malevolence right.
It's just a fear,

4053
03:10:04,001 --> 03:10:06,130
a pain,
no one invites you out and so.

4054
03:10:06,430 --> 03:10:10,220
So I'm a social pain in an ideological 
pain and now I'm a nutritional paints.

4055
03:10:10,770 --> 03:10:11,603
No friends.
How difficult is it when you're trying 

4056
03:10:13,241 --> 03:10:15,970
to get breakfast?
Like what do you do when you.

4057
03:10:16,330 --> 03:10:18,760
Well,
lots of times when we traveling we cook,

4058
03:10:19,670 --> 03:10:21,890
so we usually stay in places where you 
can cook,

4059
03:10:22,670 --> 03:10:23,503
but most places you can get a steak and 
so that's mostly what we do when 

4060
03:10:27,110 --> 03:10:27,943
traveling in a motor home and so we've 
been cooking in the motorhome and so 

4061
03:10:31,300 --> 03:10:33,410
carrie beef jerky with me,
which we make,

4062
03:10:33,690 --> 03:10:36,050
so yeah,
it's crazy.

4063
03:10:36,710 --> 03:10:37,543
You make your own beef jerky.
We have a dehydrator and you just 

4064
03:10:40,311 --> 03:10:42,590
basically put salt on it,
throw it in the dehydrator.

4065
03:10:42,591 --> 03:10:46,820
so that works pretty well.
You anticipate continuing this?

4066
03:10:47,970 --> 03:10:50,550
Well,
I remember god forever is a long time.

4067
03:10:50,551 --> 03:10:51,384
I'd like to be able to eat more things,
but I'm going to experiment with that 

4068
03:10:53,971 --> 03:10:54,661
very,
very,

4069
03:10:54,661 --> 03:10:55,291
very,
very,

4070
03:10:55,291 --> 03:10:56,124
very cautiously.
I'm going to add mushrooms next because 

4071
03:10:58,590 --> 03:11:01,590
maybe I could eat them well.
This is why I'm asking.

4072
03:11:01,980 --> 03:11:02,813
There's

4073
03:11:02,980 --> 03:11:03,813
positive benefits that a lot of people 
achieve and experience when they 

4074
03:11:07,271 --> 03:11:08,104
switched to a vegan diet,
things it is as you get off of the 

4075
03:11:10,961 --> 03:11:11,794
standard american diet with lots of 
refined sugars and preservatives and 

4076
03:11:16,950 --> 03:11:20,470
bullshit,
and then you find positive benefits.

4077
03:11:20,471 --> 03:11:22,480
chris kresser has gone into depth about 
this,

4078
03:11:22,481 --> 03:11:23,314
but then over time to nutritional 
deficiencies in that start to wear on 

4079
03:11:28,301 --> 03:11:30,910
your health.
And I'm wondering,

4080
03:11:32,670 --> 03:11:33,860
certainly possible while,
uh,

4081
03:11:33,861 --> 03:11:35,960
certainly eventually this diet will kill
me.

4082
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:40,610
No life will well near right.
Biology will,

4083
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:42,050
yes.
And less so in science.

4084
03:11:42,051 --> 03:11:46,340
Intervenes might be for some people have
a vegan diet or vegan diet.

4085
03:11:46,341 --> 03:11:49,580
Is it preferable to a standard american 
diet?

4086
03:11:50,060 --> 03:11:50,840
For sure,

4087
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:51,673
to a standard american diet.
But also there's so much biological 

4088
03:11:53,931 --> 03:11:55,450
variability,
you know,

4089
03:11:55,490 --> 03:11:57,250
the things that bothers some people 
don't bother.

4090
03:11:58,040 --> 03:11:58,873
And that's,
that's something that we got to take 

4091
03:12:00,661 --> 03:12:01,770
into consideration.
Yeah.

4092
03:12:01,771 --> 03:12:04,440
Well that's why I don't want to 
universalize for my experience,

4093
03:12:04,920 --> 03:12:05,753
but,
but this is what's happened to me and 

4094
03:12:06,931 --> 03:12:08,760
this is what's happened to my wife and 
my daughter.

4095
03:12:08,761 --> 03:12:09,594
So.
And all of it's been well with mckayla 

4096
03:12:11,251 --> 03:12:12,780
lights.
It's miraculous.

4097
03:12:12,810 --> 03:12:15,660
I cannot believe that the last time I 
saw it made me cry.

4098
03:12:15,900 --> 03:12:18,690
I've never seen her look like that.
She looked so good.

4099
03:12:18,720 --> 03:12:19,553
She's so healthy and over.
Other joints are not experiencing any 

4100
03:12:21,961 --> 03:12:22,794
problems.
And she's taking no immunomodulators at 

4101
03:12:25,141 --> 03:12:26,400
all.
No medication.

4102
03:12:27,060 --> 03:12:29,190
And she was on them for jesus.
Yes.

4103
03:12:29,220 --> 03:12:31,830
More medication than you can shake a 
stick at methotrexate,

4104
03:12:31,831 --> 03:12:34,440
which is basically a,
they use it to treat cancer.

4105
03:12:34,441 --> 03:12:35,720
It's uh,
it's uh,

4106
03:12:35,930 --> 03:12:37,950
what's,
what's the cancer treating drugs called?

4107
03:12:38,490 --> 03:12:39,323
Whatever.
I don't remember at the moment she was 

4108
03:12:40,711 --> 03:12:42,600
on enbrel,
which really,

4109
03:12:42,601 --> 03:12:43,580
really helped,
but,

4110
03:12:43,610 --> 03:12:45,630
but later open to bacterial infection.

4111
03:12:45,630 --> 03:12:49,570
so she always had pneumonia in The fall,
but enbril really helped.

4112
03:12:51,260 --> 03:12:55,060
And then heaVy doses of antidepressants 
and ritalin and jesus was.

4113
03:12:55,190 --> 03:12:57,080
How long has she been on this carnivore 
diet?

4114
03:12:58,280 --> 03:12:59,990
Oh god,
she's only been eating meat.

4115
03:12:59,991 --> 03:13:03,530
It's got to be at least six to eight 
months now.

4116
03:13:04,400 --> 03:13:06,500
Wow.
And does she get blood work done?

4117
03:13:07,010 --> 03:13:07,760
uh,
yep.

4118
03:13:07,760 --> 03:13:10,340
And her blood work.
I won't comment on that.

4119
03:13:10,460 --> 03:13:12,410
I don't know the details of her blood 
work.

4120
03:13:12,960 --> 03:13:15,580
Um,
so I don't know the answer.

4121
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:18,830
That is fascinating.
I'm curious,

4122
03:13:18,900 --> 03:13:20,780
I'm,
I'm considering trying it for awhile.

4123
03:13:20,990 --> 03:13:24,440
The problem is I ate so much game meat.
There's not a lot of.

4124
03:13:24,570 --> 03:13:26,510
Get some fat.
That's the trick there.

4125
03:13:26,511 --> 03:13:27,950
Tried for a month.
See what happens.

4126
03:13:27,951 --> 03:13:28,880
You,
what the hell?

4127
03:13:28,881 --> 03:13:29,714
A month,
you know,

4128
03:13:30,290 --> 03:13:32,720
just a month now amongst.
Not hard.

4129
03:13:33,230 --> 03:13:35,240
Yeah.
Interesting.

4130
03:13:36,390 --> 03:13:38,150
All right,
let's wrap this up.

4131
03:13:38,300 --> 03:13:39,320
Already.
Did three hours.

4132
03:13:39,321 --> 03:13:40,700
It's already 2:20,
believe it or not.

4133
03:13:40,700 --> 03:13:41,630
Hey,
crazy.

4134
03:13:41,870 --> 03:13:42,703
Listen,
it's always a pleasure and I want to 

4135
03:13:44,631 --> 03:13:49,220
bring up.
How weird is this a whole association to

4136
03:13:49,221 --> 03:13:50,630
you?
Because it's weird to me.

4137
03:13:50,840 --> 03:13:55,840
The idw dew.
That of course intellectual dark web.

4138
03:13:56,391 --> 03:13:57,224
The hell it is.
It's like I've been trying to puzzle it 

4139
03:13:58,791 --> 03:13:59,624
out.
I mean I think what it is is a loose 

4140
03:14:01,221 --> 03:14:04,190
collection of early adopters of a 
revolutionary technology.

4141
03:14:04,850 --> 03:14:05,683
that's what it looks like to me.
And we found each other because we're 

4142
03:14:07,491 --> 03:14:10,640
all doing the same thing,
but it's also a bunch of people that are

4143
03:14:10,641 --> 03:14:15,641
honest intellectually honest about their
and maybe don't even don't even agree on

4144
03:14:15,990 --> 03:14:16,350
full.
Yeah,

4145
03:14:16,350 --> 03:14:18,440
well definitely but honest about 
perception.

4146
03:14:18,480 --> 03:14:20,540
Well,
and also I think interested in long form

4147
03:14:20,541 --> 03:14:21,570
discussion,
right,

4148
03:14:21,860 --> 03:14:22,693
and able to engage in it because 
otherwise we wouldn't be having the 

4149
03:14:25,341 --> 03:14:27,050
relative success that we're having in 
the,

4150
03:14:27,130 --> 03:14:28,150
in the,
in the middle,

4151
03:14:28,250 --> 03:14:29,083
you know,
and it got a name and that's kind of 

4152
03:14:30,411 --> 03:14:30,980
interesting.

4153
03:14:30,980 --> 03:14:32,420
And that's eric though.
Yeah,

4154
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:33,380
that's right.
That's eric.

4155
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:35,180
He loves it.
Oh yeah.

4156
03:14:35,181 --> 03:14:38,760
He certainly does versus spies 
definitely,

4157
03:14:38,870 --> 03:14:41,120
definitely denies it.
He loves it.

4158
03:14:41,150 --> 03:14:43,220
Which is what's most interesting about 
it.

4159
03:14:43,221 --> 03:14:44,460
I love to rib him.
Yeah.

4160
03:14:44,510 --> 03:14:45,343
One,
it's got this funny conspiratorial 

4161
03:14:46,791 --> 03:14:50,210
element there that's sort of true in 
sort of mostly dramatic.

4162
03:14:50,211 --> 03:14:53,870
And as a mathematician he's always 
looking for patterns and codes.

4163
03:14:55,010 --> 03:14:55,843
I don't know what to make of it.
I mean things get a name and then you 

4164
03:14:58,101 --> 03:14:58,934
think,
well why did that get named and well 

4165
03:14:59,961 --> 03:15:01,280
someone named it,
but yeah,

4166
03:15:01,281 --> 03:15:02,114
but the name stuck.
So it seemed apropos to some degree and 

4167
03:15:04,730 --> 03:15:06,080
well,
what do we have in common?

4168
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:07,153
Most of us are entrepreneurial.
Most of us have our own platform so we 

4169
03:15:10,041 --> 03:15:10,874
can speak independently.
Most of us are interested in long form 

4170
03:15:14,390 --> 03:15:16,250
philosophical discussions.
Primarily,

4171
03:15:16,251 --> 03:15:18,530
not political but,
but bordering on political,

4172
03:15:18,620 --> 03:15:20,690
well bands,
more political office.

4173
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:21,620
He's the most.
Yeah,

4174
03:15:21,621 --> 03:15:24,380
but he's also very sophisticated 
political commentator,

4175
03:15:24,381 --> 03:15:27,020
so he borders on both the philosophical 
and the religious.

4176
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:29,720
Um,
and then we're,

4177
03:15:29,780 --> 03:15:33,410
we're,
we're all the newly new adopters of this

4178
03:15:33,411 --> 03:15:35,810
new technology,
so that's enough to put us in a group.

4179
03:15:35,811 --> 03:15:36,531
And then,
well,

4180
03:15:36,531 --> 03:15:38,450
it turns out that we've all been talking
to each other,

4181
03:15:38,451 --> 03:15:39,284
but part of the reason for that is while
we're all doing the same thing on the 

4182
03:15:41,571 --> 03:15:42,404
net,
so it's not surprising that we're 

4183
03:15:43,101 --> 03:15:43,934
talking to each other.
So I always go for the simple 

4184
03:15:45,441 --> 03:15:47,090
explanations first,
you know,

4185
03:15:47,110 --> 03:15:47,943
it's not a movement exactly what it is.
It's the manifestation of a new 

4186
03:15:51,181 --> 03:15:52,014
technology.
And then while do we have anything in 

4187
03:15:53,911 --> 03:15:57,750
common that's worth discussing that 
would make this a viable group,

4188
03:15:57,751 --> 03:16:00,630
let's say?
And the answer to that is out of.

4189
03:16:00,631 --> 03:16:02,010
No,
you know,

4190
03:16:02,011 --> 03:16:03,120
I've been touring with ruben.

4191
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:03,953
That's been good.
It's been good to have a comedian along 

4192
03:16:05,550 --> 03:16:06,383
and he's also a good interviewer.
He does the q and a's with me and it's 

4193
03:16:09,181 --> 03:16:13,200
nice to have some levity in the mix 
because the conversations or discussions

4194
03:16:13,201 --> 03:16:16,890
with the audience are very serious,
although I can crack a joke and uh,

4195
03:16:17,580 --> 03:16:21,060
I can't tell a joke,
but if something funny occurs to be,

4196
03:16:21,061 --> 03:16:24,240
I can say it and sometimes it's funny.
So that's something,

4197
03:16:24,750 --> 03:16:25,910
um,
you know,

4198
03:16:25,911 --> 03:16:26,744
and we've been,
we've been discussing a fair bit and I 

4199
03:16:28,741 --> 03:16:31,650
had good conversations with shapiro and 
harris for that matter.

4200
03:16:31,651 --> 03:16:34,110
So there is lots of interplay between 
us,

4201
03:16:34,111 --> 03:16:34,944
but I think that's more because we,
we inhabit the same technological space 

4202
03:16:38,791 --> 03:16:43,791
more than the same ideological space 
apart from the fact that we are actually

4203
03:16:43,981 --> 03:16:48,981
interested in dialogue fundamentally.
So we'll see.

4204
03:16:49,560 --> 03:16:50,340
I mean,
I'm,

4205
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:53,160
I'm watching it with curiosity.
Are you

4206
03:16:53,390 --> 03:16:56,250
propensive do you think that there's any
potential downside?

4207
03:16:56,300 --> 03:16:58,520
So thEre's lots of downsides to it.
Sure.

4208
03:16:58,521 --> 03:16:59,780
There's lots of downsides.
I mean,

4209
03:16:59,781 --> 03:17:01,530
first of all,
you know,

4210
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:05,690
most of us are on an individual 
individualistic path.

4211
03:17:05,750 --> 03:17:07,940
I'm not,
I'm not really much of a group guy,

4212
03:17:08,600 --> 03:17:10,430
you know,
so am I in this group?

4213
03:17:10,431 --> 03:17:11,241
It's like,
well,

4214
03:17:11,241 --> 03:17:13,640
I'm pleased to be associated with you 
guys,

4215
03:17:13,641 --> 03:17:14,474
that's for sure,
but I don't really know what it would 

4216
03:17:16,521 --> 03:17:17,354
mean or if it should mean anything or if
it'll screw up what I'm doing or if 

4217
03:17:19,641 --> 03:17:20,970
it's,
I don't know anything about it,

4218
03:17:21,320 --> 03:17:23,390
but mostly I'm curious.
It's like,

4219
03:17:23,480 --> 03:17:25,980
huh,
this is a group.

4220
03:17:25,981 --> 03:17:26,814
I thought this is the rat pack.
I thought when I walked into the 

4221
03:17:28,471 --> 03:17:29,304
restaurant with us,
because we were out last night was ben 

4222
03:17:30,751 --> 03:17:33,210
shapiro,
sam harris,

4223
03:17:33,330 --> 03:17:34,950
eric weinstein,
dave rubin,

4224
03:17:34,951 --> 03:17:37,380
joe rogan,
and me and my wife tammy.

4225
03:17:37,710 --> 03:17:39,930
And so we're all walking in there and I 
thought,

4226
03:17:39,931 --> 03:17:42,270
well this is kinda like being in the rat
pack in the 19 fifties.

4227
03:17:42,270 --> 03:17:42,840
I thought,
well,

4228
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:43,830
I know,
maybe it isn't,

4229
03:17:43,831 --> 03:17:46,460
but that's what came to mind.
So I thought that's funny and it's,

4230
03:17:46,461 --> 03:17:47,294
it's,
it's kind of cool and it's interesting 

4231
03:17:48,691 --> 03:17:52,050
and it's edgy and all of that.
But I'm not,

4232
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:54,820
I'm not taking it seriously.
I'm not,

4233
03:17:54,920 --> 03:17:56,100
I'm not also not,
you know,

4234
03:17:56,101 --> 03:17:58,140
I'm not taking it.
Not seriously either,

4235
03:17:58,141 --> 03:17:58,974
but I'm just watching.
I'm watching everybody interact because 

4236
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:04,350
it is a very motley crew of people.
It is so,

4237
03:18:04,351 --> 03:18:08,520
and they're very different and so,
but it was very enjoyable.

4238
03:18:08,521 --> 03:18:09,510
Thank you.
Okay,

4239
03:18:09,530 --> 03:18:11,100
so why did you think it was enjoyable?

4240
03:18:11,530 --> 03:18:12,610
Good conversation.
I mean,

4241
03:18:13,230 --> 03:18:14,063
everyone that was in that group has been
on my podcast or I've been on there and 

4242
03:18:17,800 --> 03:18:21,570
you know,
it's a fun group of really honest,

4243
03:18:21,660 --> 03:18:25,040
interesting people that truly are very 
peculiar people.

4244
03:18:25,080 --> 03:18:27,780
Especially eric.
He's listening right now.

4245
03:18:27,781 --> 03:18:29,970
That's what I'm fucking with them.
I love that guy,

4246
03:18:30,210 --> 03:18:32,060
but I mean they're all,
they're all,

4247
03:18:32,130 --> 03:18:32,963
everyone's different but everyone's also
unique and they all bring a lot to the 

4248
03:18:35,641 --> 03:18:37,170
table and that's what's interesting 
about it.

4249
03:18:37,600 --> 03:18:40,700
The weird collection,
you know,

4250
03:18:40,710 --> 03:18:41,543
I don't know what to think of it.
Like when eric called me up about the 

4251
03:18:43,981 --> 03:18:45,180
whole New York times thing,
I'm like,

4252
03:18:45,181 --> 03:18:48,070
what are you talking about?
Like we're all together in this and you

4253
03:18:48,070 --> 03:18:49,660
did that.
Why did you do that?

4254
03:18:49,960 --> 03:18:50,650
What do I do?
What?

4255
03:18:50,650 --> 03:18:52,690
What did you be part of the New York 
times article?

4256
03:18:52,750 --> 03:18:53,583
A barely was.
I just answered a couple of questions 

4257
03:18:56,170 --> 03:18:58,300
because you got a picture.
Yeah.

4258
03:18:58,301 --> 03:19:00,470
They asked me to take a picture.
I picture of you right.

4259
03:19:00,550 --> 03:19:02,620
They didn't,
they should have taken a picture of me.

4260
03:19:02,800 --> 03:19:04,900
I was dressed like I was going on stage 
at the comedy store.

4261
03:19:04,901 --> 03:19:05,734
I didn't wear anything any differently.
They were trying to make a big deal of 

4262
03:19:07,571 --> 03:19:07,811
it.
I'm like,

4263
03:19:07,811 --> 03:19:08,830
look,
I don't have any time.

4264
03:19:09,300 --> 03:19:10,910
You want to take a picture.
This is what I'm wearing.

4265
03:19:10,911 --> 03:19:11,460
Yeah.
And,

4266
03:19:11,460 --> 03:19:12,293
and we,
we did it on the parking lot above the 

4267
03:19:14,351 --> 03:19:16,480
comedy store and it started to rain.
I go,

4268
03:19:16,481 --> 03:19:17,740
we're done.
I gotta go,

4269
03:19:18,010 --> 03:19:19,810
I gotta go on stage.
I can't be soaking wet,

4270
03:19:19,990 --> 03:19:22,390
you know,
and then go on stage and that was it,

4271
03:19:22,490 --> 03:19:23,350
you know,
it was just.

4272
03:19:23,740 --> 03:19:25,600
Okay.
So your take on it is that it's.

4273
03:19:25,630 --> 03:19:26,920
Well,
it's intro your take on it.

4274
03:19:26,921 --> 03:19:28,180
Is that it's interest?
Yes.

4275
03:19:28,210 --> 03:19:29,043
Well this is the,
this is probably another thing that 

4276
03:19:30,940 --> 03:19:31,773
unites that group of people.
Everyone in that group of people is 

4277
03:19:35,471 --> 03:19:38,380
likely to get in trouble because they 
find too many things.

4278
03:19:38,381 --> 03:19:40,330
Interesting.
Trait,

4279
03:19:40,360 --> 03:19:41,193
openness.
That's another thing that unites all of 

4280
03:19:42,491 --> 03:19:47,491
us and you know,
curiosity killed the cat and so did,

4281
03:19:47,640 --> 03:19:51,010
but we're not cats.
True curiosity also built the pyramids.

4282
03:19:51,070 --> 03:19:51,903
It did,
it did,

4283
03:19:51,910 --> 03:19:53,690
it did,
and it saved a lot of caps too.

4284
03:19:56,400 --> 03:19:57,640
Let's end with that.
Alright.

4285
03:19:57,670 --> 03:19:59,640
Alright Jordan.
Pleasure my friend joe.

4286
03:19:59,641 --> 03:20:01,450
Always good to see you again.
See you always.

4287
03:20:01,530 --> 03:20:02,830
Yeah,
that's it folks.

4288
03:20:02,860 --> 03:20:03,693
See you soon.
