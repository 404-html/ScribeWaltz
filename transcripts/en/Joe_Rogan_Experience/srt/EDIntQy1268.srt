00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,240
that happens just slightly because a lot
of people are in a cave in situation

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:11,530
when it comes to their lives,
they're literally buried under a series

4
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:15,790
of antiquated,
stale symbols that they're looking at

5
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,430
the universe through and they feel
trapped.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,580
It's like their shoes are too tight and
if like a psychedelic or meditating too,

7
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:27,650
and I really mean that.
I'm not just saying that to say that

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,520
because I'm.
I really think meditation has a very

9
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:32,350
similar effect,
but any of these things,

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,210
they reset those symbols.
Structures in your brain and if you just

11
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:41,080
like if you're in a cave in and you get
an extra inch compared to like being

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,080
pressed against the wall,
that's a big fucking deal man.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,340
So it's slightly percentage difference.
Change change is like,

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,430
oh thank God I'm 13 percent less
frightened than it was for my entire

15
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:54,380
life.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,760
Have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk
about changing paths in life is you get

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,210
really,
really interesting analogy.

18
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:03,980
He talks about like you're going to cars
going the exactly saint or a boat or two

19
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:08,660
boats going exactly the same direction,
but one boat just takes a two degree

20
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:10,620
turn,
just two degrees here.

21
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,320
As they go further down the one boat
that took two degrees turn is going to

22
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:19,100
go wider and wider away from the
original path and that each decision

23
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:20,390
that you make,
that's a good decision.

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,890
Takes you closer even though it's just
like you're just steering your ship,

25
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:29,630
just dirt as you go out.
It's going to be a much different path,

26
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,110
a much different end than if you just
stayed on the original path.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,800
That's incredible.
Different and psychedelics makes you go

28
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,090
right.
Turn Clyde.

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,120
Yep.
I mean at the the,

30
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,970
the currents.
Try to bring you back though.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,010
Yes.
Well ego tries to eat bread in the

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,480
current.
Kind of bring it back to where you were

33
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:49,130
going,
so it's like got to take them a good.

34
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,960
Well,
I've always said get off that current

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,380
doing psychedelics.
It's like pressing the reset button for

36
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,680
your brain.
Like control all the.

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,940
Remember that,
that your your desktop reboots and

38
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:02,360
there's only one folder on the desktop
and that's that desktop says the folder

39
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:05,000
says my old bullshit and you have two
choices.

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,940
Either you just like create a completely
different desktop,

41
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:12,590
look at reality as a completely
different or open up my old bullshit and

42
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,470
fall back into these familiar patterns
because they're very comforting,

43
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,400
right?
You know,

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,080
in those moments after the psychedelic
experience are so important to grab and

45
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:25,130
hang onto because it gives you this
opportunity to make this new way of

46
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:26,930
thinking like a part of your habit.

47
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,540
Once you get in that habit,
whether it's fucking,

48
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,930
you know,
30 days or 60 days or 90 days,

49
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,280
like people say that once you like have
a pattern ingrained in how you behave

50
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:41,990
and think and do it just takes a
consistent approach to that pattern and

51
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:45,950
then it becomes like an like a part of
you like that's why people quit smoking.

52
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:48,710
Like get past 90 days and you'll be all
right.

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,380
Right?
Jews say when you have,

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,190
if you go to sit in the same feed three
times,

55
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:53,510
he's just keep sitting there.
That's your,

56
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,590
that's your two old time seed.
Wow,

57
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,903
that's smart.

58
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,280
I'd make sense.
It's like when you take a psychedelic,

59
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,440
it's like if your life is a polluted
city,

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,570
like what are those?
Polluted like Detroit,

61
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,680
Detroit.
Right.

62
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,030
And it's like the psychedelic all of a
sudden takes you in a helicopter outside

63
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:13,030
the pollution and so now you're seeing,
Oh God,

64
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,350
the air up here so fresh.
It's so nice down here.

65
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,380
But the thing is helicopter going to
land.

66
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,010
It's going to put you back out into your
city and that's where the job starts,

67
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:21,791
which is like,
Shit,

68
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,780
man,
how can I clean this fucking thing up?

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,970
And then that's,
that's like the.

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,760
That's when you start doing things like
exercising,

71
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,700
meditating,
or that's where you create just a very

72
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:37,540
simple intention in everything you do,
which is as much as possible.

73
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:42,130
I'm going to try to alleviate the
suffering of people around me as much as

74
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,360
I can.
You know,

75
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,590
not.
That might not be a lot,

76
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,240
it might just be call,
it might just be those.

77
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,400
So we got back from,
from this last UFC,

78
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,010
just a little bit of mushrooms was
enough that I saw a homeless guy and he

79
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,830
was looking for.
I was like,

80
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,620
I opened my wallet and I only have
twenties,

81
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,480
and I was like,
no,

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
fuck,
fuck it.

83
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,530
There you go.
That's what it does.

84
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,120
And those little moments,
man,

85
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:06,110
it shows you that you get those moments
present themselves to you all day,

86
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:09,290
fucking long.
But if you are stuck in selfishness,

87
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,124
you don't see it.
Yeah.

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,740
It's real simple little things,
but it's fun.

89
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,310
It's a very wonderful.
That kind of simple intention can really

90
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,240
deep pollute your,
your subjective city that you've been

91
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,360
sucking in shitty gas.
There was one title.

92
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:24,010
I saw it

93
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,100
that I was the only time I was like,
I've worked guide to somebody,

94
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,770
but it was Willie Hunter was on him and
he was shitting on following.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,230
He was shitting on some like comic who
would become like a vine star,

96
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,120
you know,
so she was a shitty comment,

97
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,410
but it became like a.
and he was like,

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,230
I hate fine.
We're like,

99
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,270
fine man.
They're just for fun.

100
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,680
There's six seconds from videos.
He's like,

101
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,514
no,
I hate him.

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,950
Like,
what about a six second youtube video?

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Watch that,
whatever.

104
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,530
He was just big,
shitty and really try to talk about it.

105
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:46,600
He couldn't stop that.
We started with the mushrooms and he was

106
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,620
like,
I'm a bad person.

107
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,220
Fine.
And he kept doing it and eventually I

108
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,170
was like,
listen,

109
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,530
you're right.
That was you being a bad person and I'm

110
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,460
so sorry.
But I was like,

111
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:00,830
it's okay because here's the deal from
now on,

112
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,580
you don't have to be that anymore.
You can just let that go and let people

113
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:05,414
talk.
And he's like,

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,460
yeah,
yeah,

115
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,470
that's what it shows you,
like you can change,

116
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,590
but that thing you're talking about
where you realize,

117
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:12,630
shit,
I'm a bad person.

118
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,990
That is um,
there's,

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,970
I can't remember the name and Buddhism.
There's an actual name for that and it's

120
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:22,020
considered to be a very sweet moment
where you need that moment.

121
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,430
It's virtualized or where you need that
moment where you look at your life and

122
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:31,020
you feel this very specific kind of
sadness because you look at all the

123
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:34,410
times you could have been kinder all the
times.

124
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:37,170
You could have called that person back
all the times.

125
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,400
He could have made decisions that were
pushing your boat and the direction of a

126
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:45,390
better world and you didn't do it and
you should feel sad about that,

127
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,730
but you shouldn't spend your whole life
feeling sad about it.

128
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,910
You should just spend some time there
and look at it and think,

129
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,070
okay,
well that's gone.

130
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,060
The past has been devoured by time.
There's only this moment,

131
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,260
and so from this point forward,
as much as I can,

132
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,500
my decisions are going to be based on
reducing the suffering of my species,

133
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,860
and that means like if your trash is
when you have to let her keep going

134
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:10,460
forever.
