1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,650
Hello,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,910
freak bitches.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,043
That stink.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,530
Yeah,

5
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,210
the bathroom smells so bad.

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,780
The bathroom smells so bad from pollution.

7
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:11,070
I think just from the polluted water,

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,830
just polluted water makes it smell man.

9
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,763
And also they don't.

10
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,283
They don't want,

11
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,230
you can't even say it died.

12
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,263
Thinking about it,

13
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,670
they have a lot of toilets.

14
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,630
Was just no toilet.

15
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,700
It's just,

16
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,050
it's just a porcelain hole.

17
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:25,980
You have to.

18
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,630
Squat is a squat.

19
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,141
Supposedly.

20
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,040
It's better for your bowels.

21
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,180
Supposedly.

22
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,690
Supposedly I was in the Forbidden City.

23
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:42,120
I was walking around there
with the emperor's palace.

24
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,770
Yeah.

25
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,370
And I got bad diarrhea.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,631
It was bad.

27
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:46,201
Like sweating,

28
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,460
like I gotTa Fuck Fuck.

29
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,100
And then there's a picture toilet and
you go in there and you fucking run and

30
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,501
smells.

31
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:56,420
As soon as you cross the threshold of
the smells and you open up the first toy,

32
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,610
the stall door and your mind
can't even register it first.

33
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,090
Like,

34
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,420
this must be under construction
because there's no toilet here.

35
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,740
So that's the only explanation.

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,690
And then you go to the
next one and you're like,

37
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,140
what?

38
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,510
Oh,

39
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,343
zero papers.

40
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,380
No,

41
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,220
there's no paper.

42
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:13,650
Well,

43
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,311
first I just said,

44
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,144
I'm not doing this.

45
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:15,930
I'm not.

46
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,763
I walked away.

47
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,671
Oh my God.

48
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,081
I was like,

49
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:19,760
I took like two steps out of the bathroom,

50
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,221
and I was like,

51
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:20,461
oh yeah,

52
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:20,941
diarrhea,

53
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,810
what do you mean I'm not doing it?

54
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,823
Of course I'm doing it.

55
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,030
So you went back in and wash your butt.

56
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,193
You have to do.

57
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,410
So this guy who owned the bar,

58
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,550
the club was in Shanghai,

59
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:30,270
gave me this,

60
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,730
these,

61
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,830
this tissue packet,

62
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,531
and he goes,

63
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:32,970
you'll need it.

64
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,050
I thought it was for pollution,

65
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,251
and he goes,

66
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,150
you'll need this.

67
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,770
And I just had.

68
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,190
Yeah.

69
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,850
And then it was like,

70
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,960
oh yeah,

71
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,090
you got to pull your
pants all the way down.

72
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,770
Squat over it,

73
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,840
but also try to shit into your pants.

74
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,680
You can't go over the balls of your feet.

75
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,570
Oh No,

76
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,920
there's probably a better way.

77
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,080
What do you do with
explosive diarrhea though?

78
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,420
It seems like you're going to
miss lasted into that hole.

79
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,690
You're,

80
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:57,900
you're,

81
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,580
you're,

82
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,170
you're like half a foot over the hole.

83
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,340
Is that good for your quads?

84
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,660
It's good for your core.

85
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,543
That definitely.

86
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,070
I would feel like that would really
work your core a lot and there's no air

87
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,431
conditioning.

88
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,620
It's so hot that would work here.

89
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:14,100
Resolve.

90
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,311
Yeah.

91
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,240
That's why the is a thing.

92
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,810
Maybe it's not the low sugar diet shit.

93
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,540
You hate your ankles.

94
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,480
So because I'm going to have
explosive diarrhea feels was like.

95
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,590
I'm just going to hit my picture.

96
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:23,191
This picture,

97
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,480
this I'm down,

98
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,030
I'm squatting right now.

99
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,720
So like your,

100
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,620
your ass is right over the whole
filling the hole essentially.

101
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:31,891
Feet.

102
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,690
If you're moved to far enough away,

103
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,100
what do you do if you have bad knees,

104
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,750
you do after that.

105
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,870
But I sit like that all the time.

106
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,700
That's how it usually just squat,

107
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,600
eat all the time.

108
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,740
I do that sometimes.

109
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,510
It's like that.

110
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:45,661
Yeah,

111
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,080
sure.

112
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,430
Once in a while back,

113
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,753
it's just

114
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,970
in one of those toilets,

115
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,930
somebody dropped their brand new phone
in the toilet and so the husband went to

116
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:58,140
go in there and grab it passed
down because of the fumes.

117
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,890
And the woman tried to grab

118
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,250
the guy out.

119
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,101
Two people died.

120
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,934
Three injured,

121
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,450
uh,

122
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,283
falling in,

123
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,670
stand by me with.

124
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,290
They're all barfing smelling

125
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,010
so good.

126
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,910
America,

127
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,571
Dick Cheney's,

128
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:13,960
right.

129
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,793
They had those.

130
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,490
They have those shutters on the train
when it's moving around and stuff.

131
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,330
They have those shitters Dick Cheney's.

132
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,183
Right.

133
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,990
I opened up my tissue packets.

134
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,281
What?

135
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:24,114
What did he say?

136
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,850
Right.

137
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,440
We have the best.

138
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,211
It sounds like.

139
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,760
Can we do a douchebag definition possible?

140
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,260
When you say Douche bag there,

141
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:36,740
I'm curious as to what
specifically just dumb assholes,

142
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,131
assholes.

143
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,170
Like you ever go to Kim
Kardashians instagram page.

144
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,613
None of them.

145
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,750
A little wheezes.

146
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,170
Go there and just read some of
the comments about children.

147
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,660
Anything.

148
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,010
Anything that's just fucking.

149
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,844
Hey,

150
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm sure it's.

151
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,060
I'm sure it's there.

152
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,911
It's diluted.

153
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,450
Youtube.

154
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,320
It's because it's you're,

155
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:56,530
you're.

156
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,310
You're commenting on a photo or a video
instead of like a twitter where you're

157
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,450
just talking about words for it.

158
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,420
I honestly think anything worth
anything should be comments,

159
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,254
deleted,

160
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,190
comments,

161
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,000
disabled,

162
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,820
because the problem is they very rarely,

163
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,470
it's.

164
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,010
It's rare that you.

165
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,340
It generates a really fascinating
conversation in the comments.

166
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,280
It's super common that it
just country shitheads.

167
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,510
It depends on the subject matter.

168
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,990
Like in,

169
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,591
in my case,

170
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,780
sometimes I do get relevant
discussion in the comments,

171
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
a tech discussion,

172
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,170
like did it pretty respectful,

173
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:30,040
but you do get this weird fanboys and
stuff that gets a militant surprisingly is

174
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,550
like a more way.

175
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,743
I don't know.

176
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,580
I have this theory like,

177
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,301
you know,

178
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,940
when you go to a coffee shop and
you look around you at starbucks,

179
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,740
everyone has their phones on the table.

180
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,910
You notice that like,

181
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:42,060
yeah,

182
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,140
like it's in a public space,

183
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,630
it's like representative
of you in some way.

184
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,070
And I have this feeling that
this is for a lot of people,

185
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:51,300
this is a major investment,

186
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:51,490
you know,

187
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,920
outside of their car or whatever.

188
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,701
It's really close to you.

189
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:54,780
It's in your pocket all the time.

190
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,890
And so I think people are really
concerned with making the wrong decision.

191
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,311
You know,

192
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:01,830
they're really concerned that
their thing is not the best.

193
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
And so in my case what will happen
is I'll put up a video within,

194
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,750
you know,

195
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,280
they haven't even had time
to finish watching it and
apple socs or android sucks

196
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:11,820
or whatever.

197
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,870
And really it's fear.

198
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,250
It's fear that you made the
wrong decision and so it,

199
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,521
well,

200
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,660
like many places in life,

201
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,970
you get angry when you're afraid and so,

202
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,960
God forbid a new product comes out that
obsoletes yours and you don't have the

203
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:25,890
money to replace it.

204
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,660
So you take this position of defending
the other thing because that's easier

205
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,310
than justifying the cost of the new one.

206
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,140
So,

207
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,560
uh,

208
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:33,750
I've,

209
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,440
I've actually,

210
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,950
uh,

211
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,400
there were a couple of really
cool articles on Fanboy
ism that I was interviewed

212
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:39,760
for and you know,

213
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,170
we went,

214
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,520
we went deep into how,

215
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:41,941
you know,

216
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,380
how people sort of figured that out.

217
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,401
But uh,

218
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:49,401
there's definitely this
undercurrent below the tech space,

219
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:53,430
the consumer product space where these
are becoming more and more like fashion

220
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:53,941
symbols,

221
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:54,770
like,

222
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,603
like a,

223
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,891
you know,

224
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,060
rep representative of your,

225
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,810
maybe more so than this then as a tool,

226
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:00,081
you know,

227
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:00,410
less,

228
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,890
less of a hammer and more
like a piece of jewelry,

229
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:04,671
like a watch or something.

230
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,580
Isn't it also that people
just love being on teams,

231
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,280
whether it's team.

232
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,113
Oh,

233
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,540
Publican team shelly most,

234
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,531
most definitely.

235
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:12,910
And,

236
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,720
and I've done some rants
on this in the past.

237
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,380
Like I feel the need to tell people
like I'm a fan of technology when I was

238
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,131
coming up as a kid,

239
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,590
like if anybody brought
me any of this stuff,

240
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,530
I would be super excited of course.

241
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,850
And I'm cool with saying that,

242
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,630
you know,

243
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,830
but uh,

244
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,731
but yeah,

245
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:29,181
there is,

246
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,420
there is definitely a
team aspect where people,

247
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:36,740
they want to belong to something I say
belong to team technology if that's what

248
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:37,251
you're into.

249
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:42,251
Because the truth is these devices and
these platforms push one another that the

250
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,220
positive things that happened in android
push ios to be better than the positive

251
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,830
things that happened in Ios
push android to be better.

252
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,020
And the same thing goes for laptops,

253
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:52,100
desktops really anywhere.

254
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,970
There's innovation.

255
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,790
Having a little bit of
competition is a positive thing.
