1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,700
Hey,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,620
we're here with Megan
Miller and Ryan Parson.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,330
We just got done doing a podcast.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,930
Yes we did.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,301
That's fine.

6
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,490
It was that the first one you've done?

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,370
I Dunno.

8
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:12,940
Yeah,

9
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,080
every time it was more fun.

10
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,310
I feel like I yell too much

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,180
like Julie Diaz,

12
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,290
you gotta Yo let it out
and then come back to us.

13
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,471
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:22,090
I apologize.

15
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,901
Don't get me wrong.

16
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:25,890
I feel bad about it too and I'm like,

17
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,360
I don't even realize I'm at your
house screaming and yelling.

18
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,940
I like Joey the mayhem
experience and accept it.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,833
No worries

20
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,630
ma'am.

21
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,960
Ma'Am.

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,720
I'm known mayhem since he was a skinny
youngster when he was hanging around with

23
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,554
margin laymen.

24
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,040
That was back in the day

25
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,760
like coach on the ultimate fighter.

26
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:51,260
I coached just like mark laymen.

27
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,690
Like I was saying the same
words that he used to say,

28
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,120
but he's way more monotone and like,

29
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:56,841
ah,

30
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,160
I'm not bought a town.

31
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:59,330
What are you talking about?

32
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:00,390
Like like that.

33
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,230
I have a different style
but like realize damn,

34
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,350
I could have went with them so
long that I coach just like a bell.

35
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:06,751
Yeah.

36
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,820
He said Jujitsu wizard.

37
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,690
That guy is,

38
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,160
he's an encyclopedia of
Jiu Jitsu information,

39
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:11,610
man.

40
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,680
It's just be get blazed a bunch of tapes.

41
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,881
It's interesting,

42
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,061
man.

43
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,500
He's got everything categorized and
shit and I've talked to him about it.

44
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,800
She just do philosophy
pretty organized about it,

45
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,653
you know?

46
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,440
Yeah.

47
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,690
He's,

48
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,130
he's,

49
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,350
he was the only the organized dude.

50
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,193
It was shocked me.

51
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,910
He would have all those
tapes all lined up.

52
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,091
Like,

53
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:26,271
man,

54
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:27,260
I could never do that.

55
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,751
Like,

56
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:27,950
you know,

57
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,220
this tape sign up and nowhere
in his tape library stuff was,

58
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,111
he was also a duty.

59
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,030
He didn't want to cut weight.

60
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,290
He was like lazy and Shit.

61
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,180
So he would like battle.

62
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,360
Dude.

63
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,240
It's way bigger than him.

64
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,140
Yeah.

65
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,430
It had to be real technical,

66
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,950
but he's just a smart dude.

67
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:41,970
He's always been a smart dude.

68
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,051
That's a weird world.

69
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,780
Isn't that the world of the coach
that's never been a fighter,

70
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,390
you know,

71
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,223
it's my world.

72
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,241
It was so weird.

73
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,950
He was so stressed to compete too.

74
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:51,450
I remember he was so stressed out.

75
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,284
I was like shocked.

76
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,560
He was like

77
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,760
kind of,

78
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,100
he would be so amped to,

79
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,010
to coach.

80
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,843
It was a for me.

81
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,980
He'd perform good and you had a good,

82
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,043
they're a good career.

83
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,720
Uh,

84
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,553
grappling ghetto.

85
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,270
Yeah.

86
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,461
Yeah.

87
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:05,891
Mark Lane.

88
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:06,690
It's a beast,

89
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,231
but it is a,

90
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:07,921
it's a weird world,

91
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,131
right?

92
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,670
Isn't it?

93
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,780
Being a coach,

94
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,470
Brian on the sabbath,

95
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:12,271
talk about it bro,

96
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:12,810
because,

97
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,643
well,

98
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,250
it's not so much because there's
enough talented fighters are on.

99
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:19,830
The guys can get that aspect of stop,

100
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,371
stop,

101
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:20,800
stop,

102
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,633
stop.

103
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,240
May Ham was waking up,

104
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,470
the neighbors and the cops came,

105
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,840
so we had to double back.

106
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,730
Now we're in a different location,

107
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,440
far away from the fuzz.

108
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,760
You know,

109
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,500
Shit gets hairy when you're
hanging out with mayhem.

110
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,640
She gets hairy when you're
hanging out with a star,

111
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:40,474
a bully beat down.

112
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
The current hosted the ultimate fighter.

113
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm not a host bro coach,

114
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,233
I guess you could say.

115
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:46,911
Well,

116
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:47,070
yeah,

117
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,690
I shouldn't say the host
call cohosting don't they

118
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,240
read one of his coaches?

119
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,030
Most of the ultimate fighter,

120
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:57,421
but I guess,

121
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:57,730
yeah,

122
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,563
coaching.

123
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,023
I'm not going,

124
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,431

129
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,770
Could narrow.

130
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,211
Yeah.

131
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,530
We probably have her buddy fight.

132
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,370
Shoot a buck style.

133
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,370

what'd you think about Ellenberger
made perfect sense to me.

149
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,081
I felt like,

150
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,421
you know,

151
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,920
like we train the hell out of that kid
and he went in there and did his job.

152
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,371
Yeah.

153
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,380
He fucking knew what was going to happen.

154
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,850
He knew what shields

155

00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,341

163
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:51,640

168
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,781
irrational.

174
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,190
Eddie Bravo on the podcast,

175
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,083
we dropped some knowledge,

176
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,590
drop some knowledge about weed.

177
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,761
He had a cure up.

178
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,594
Some haters.

179
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,800
We've talked about this,

180
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,670
unfortunately ed,

181
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,890
he's got some haters online and people
make some unfortunate statements and one

182
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,891
of those statements was made about him
wanting to being a bad role model because

183
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:36,220
he says that marijuana enhanced his
life and marijuana help does Jujitsu and

184
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:40,360
marijuana helps us music
and his creativity and some
would Jujitsu guy who we

185
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,850
both respect an amazing Jujitsu guy,

186
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,920
but unfortunately he's just,

187
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,730
he's got a shitty idea about what weed is.

188
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,580
So we,

189
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,860
I used to be just like you complete.

190
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,320
Oh,

191
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,970
I used to hate potheads.

192
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,250
Then how was the,

193
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,610
I was worse than you until I did some
research and found out the truth.

194
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,110
You could find out the truth
to come $3 just buy in,

195
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,953
buy some books.

196
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,980
You can go to Barnes and nobles and they
have a whole section on weed and it's

197
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,330
not negative stuff.

198
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,410
It's a whole section on the week.

199
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,280
But it's funny because when someone makes
a big statement like that and it makes

200
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,330
a big deal at uh,

201
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:13,890
uh,

202
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,260
you,

203
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,600
you smoking weed and
says you're an idiot man,

204
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:16,861
they,

205
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:17,090
they,

206
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,090
they do way more harm for the cause
of anti week than they do good.

207
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,351
You know,

208
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:24,490
because he calling you an idiot.

209
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,180
All it does is make them look silly
and irrational and then it gives you an

210
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:29,470
opportunity to defend yourself.

211
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,670
And then when you defend yourself,

212
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,530
fucking facts start flying out and
information and emotional testimony where

213
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,740
you're talking about in your praising the,

214
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:38,650
the positive effect.

215
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,540
It's way more advertisement for weed.

216
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,300
Every time someone steps up and
say something shitty about weed,

217
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,980
the backlash is way bigger now
than it's ever been before.

218
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,360
The move movement actually needs people
like called Credo to call us idiots.

219
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,780
Cause then we bring
out the facts and then,

220
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,080
you know,

221
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,680
we,

222
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,460
the people are on the fence about weed.

223
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,971
You know,

224
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:02,120
a good portion of them when
presented with a correct fats,

225
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,601
they'll go,

226
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:03,380
oh shit,

227
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,390
they'll jump over people way
on the other side of the fence.

228
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,580
We're never going to get those guys.

229
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:07,340
Not right now.

230
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,020
They're too caught in their ways.

231
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:09,530
That's fine.

232
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:09,831
I mean,

233
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:10,664
I used to be there.

234
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,360
I totally understand what their feelings
are about drugs fucking up your life

235
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,740
and ruining and becoming a crutch.

236
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,030
I know exactly what you're saying.

237
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,241
You're,

238
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,470
you're absolutely right there.

239
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,101
For some people,

240
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:21,440
some drugs can become a crutch.

241
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:21,950
What,

242
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,920
what marijuana is to me and
what it is to Eddie is not,

243
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,390
it's a spiritual thing.

244
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:26,881
It's,

245
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:27,130
it's,

246
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,220
it's an an theologian.

247
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,700
It's,

248
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,800
it's something that connects you to truth.

249
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,750
It's something that connects you to a
higher feeling of understanding a higher

250
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,590
sensitivity.

251
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,341
And,

252
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:37,630
uh,

253
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:37,871
I,

254
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:40,610
I refuse to accept the fact
that that's bad for you.

255
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,070
I think if used and harnessed correctly,

256
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,450
it's most certainly good for you.

257
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,480
And that if people learned
about how good it is for you,

258
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:48,470
it can enhance their life,

259
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,580
including cops,

260
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:50,000
man,

261
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,340
including all these people that think
it's bad and they think people should go

262
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,174
to jail for it.

263
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,290
It can enhance your life too,

264
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:54,740
man.

265
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,101
There's,

266
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,960
there's a lot of shit that
people should go to jail for it.

267
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,710
You're right.

268
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,330
There's a lot of drugs
that are terrible for you.

269
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,230
You're fucking right.

270
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,940
There's a lot of drugs
and if you sell them,

271
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,220
you're a piece of shit and you
should be removed from society.

272
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,020
I agree with you.

273
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,841
But pots I,

274
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:10,940
one of a man needs thrown in there for
the all the wrong reasons and if you look

275
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:11,840
at it correctly,

276
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,350
you realize that this is something that
makes people happy and it's nature and

277
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,750
it's put here on earth.

278
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,300
People have had a symbiotic relationship
with this plan for 10,000 fucking years

279
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,290
and the only reason we keep talking
about it is because we will get thrown in

280
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,010
jail for it.

281
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,630
Even though the state says it's legal,

282
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,613
the feds,

283
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,680
the DEA,

284
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,000
they,

285
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,660
they think they could just come in and
just ignore state law and just put people

286
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,230
in jail.

287
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,970
That's why I'm talking
about it all the time.

288
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:39,971
I'm trying to do my part
in the legalization process
to open people's eyes once

289
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:41,211
it's totally,

290
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,320
completely legal and everyone's cool with
them and I'm not going to really talk

291
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:45,891
about it no more.

292
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:46,724
There's really no need.

293
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,743
Everyone's going to know.

294
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,231
It'll be,

295
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,640
it'll be knowledge.

296
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,680
It be something that's coming.

297
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,540
Understood instead of right now
it's commonly misunderstood.

298
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,630
That's the end of our
marijuana pro program.

299
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,000
Dr 10th Planet J J.

300
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:01,130
Dot Com bitches represent

301
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,860
you hadn't done the documentary,

302
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,680
but isn't that funny that that works
that way that someone sees a shirt,

303
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:08,080
it's a dope shirt and like this
documentary was gonna fucking rule.

304
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,501
Yes.

305
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,340
Cause they see the shirt.

306
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:09,981
But it's you,

307
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:10,500
it's you.

308
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,641
It's,

309
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:11,380
I mean like don't,

310
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,280
don't want to undersell it.

311
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,211
You're the first one,

312
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:14,290
but you're being a regular human being.

313
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:14,841
When you said as you go,

314
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:15,970
you gotta get me one asap.

315
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:16,451
Like,

316
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,560
I want to wear it on fear factor.

317
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,580
I want to wear it on the podcast.

318
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,100
So we rush it.

319
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:20,830
We get it.

320
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,790
A couple of sets of you,

321
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,700
a couple sentences like other people
that we know that are important to us and

322
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,800
you wear it and it fucking blows up.

323
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,940
Like literally blows up.

324
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,300
Well that's nice that I can do that.

325
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,733
Pretty easy.

326
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,590
So what was going on?

327
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,330
So when you take it,

328
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,230
when you partake,

329
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,790
partake.

330
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,210
Yes,

331
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:37,860
it's a,

332
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,460
it's apples.

333
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,210
Cabbage.

334
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,601
It's a,

335
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,180
it's a bad,

336
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,800
massively different podcasts.

337
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,100
Yeah,

338
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,581
it's different,

339
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:43,414
right?

340
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,440
Like it's cause it's,

341
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,274
you know,

342
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,550
well it's also the one,

343
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,650
the only

344
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,530
podcasts or one,

345
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,130
the only ones that I know of where they
let you know if they're smoking weed.

346
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,360
Kevin Smith does too.

347
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
He smokes weed through his whole posse.

348
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,400
Really?

349
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,641
Dude,

350
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,030
he's the biggest honor I've ever met.

351
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,200
He's constantly what can believe.

352
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,093
That's all he does now.

353
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,380
He smokes weed all day.

354
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,243
He's obsessed.

355
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,301
It's fascinating.

356
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,080
We haven't gone,

357
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,220
first time I came in here though,

358
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,550
you guys were doing the volcano
and I did not partake at all,

359
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,020
but I still got high.

360
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,180
We got so lazy with that.

361
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,014
Volcanoes.

362
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,350
Volcanoes do its work and it's
just way too easy to roll a joint.

363
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,670
I liked the volcano though.

364
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:14,720
It's healthier for your body.

365
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,640
I really should go back to.

366
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:15,830
Yeah,

367
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,830
but I was sitting next to it.

368
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,880
I was sitting next to it.

369
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,400
It does go through way too fast,

370
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,050
but that's not really a
problem here in California.

371
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,100
At least we hope it's not.

372
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,300
It's in 45 days.

373
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,860
They're supposed to close
all the dispensary's.

374
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,380
My Guy says it's horse shit.

375
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,500
He says he's not going anywhere.

376
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:31,190
He says they only gave those things
to 16 different people and he said,

377
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:31,610
uh,

378
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,450
you get to Michigan.

379
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,930
What do you mean they did?

380
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,290
The machine just cleared out Michigan,

381
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,460
all of the medical marijuana,

382
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,720
Michigan and closed down
all the fucking that stores,

383
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,350
all of them.

384
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,220
That's what I've been.

385
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,170
People on Twitter have
been telling us years.

386
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,890
Really?

387
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,491
That's crazy.

388
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:44,480
Now I'm all there,

389
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:44,900
have a,

390
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,190
they have a very fresh program.

391
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,024
It's very young.

392
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,770
California is just so deeply,

393
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:49,581
deeply ingrained.

394
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:50,820
I doubt that that can happen here.

395
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,450
Like trying to close all the McDonald's,

396
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,970
you know,

397
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,420
would take,

398
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,380
we would find some place we would find
the place because all the Mcdonald's you,

399
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:58,790
but there's one on that corner too.

400
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,690
Are you fucking kidding me?

401
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:00,411
It's really gross,

402
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:00,770
man.

403
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,300
It's really,

404
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,290
it's one of the grossest
things about our government,

405
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,710
the fact that they're continually
going after marijuana and it's,

406
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,160
there's no evidence whatsoever that
does anything bad and yet to let and

407
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:12,380
cigarettes as slide rather than the table.

408
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,280
The fucking,

409
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,390
the weeds of death.

410
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,110
These cigarettes are killing
400,000 plus people every year.

411
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,940
And nobody says a word.

412
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:21,440
They're just sliding on through.

413
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,633
You know,

414
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,670
everyone's sending jackbooted thugs to
go raid medical marijuana dispensaries

415
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,980
and take all their profits and take all
their pot and make them go to court for

416
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:33,470
it and never give it back to them and
take millions of dollars from them.

417
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,643
It's amazing.

418
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,320
It's amazing that these are,

419
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,660
these are basically thugs
for pharmaceutical companies.

420
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,910
So speaking of getting
high and look at it,

421
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:41,744
ridiculous shit.

422
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,710
This is a documentary called Kubrick's
odyssey by this guy named Jay Wiener,

423
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,640
who believes that Stanley
Kubrick fake the moon landings.

424
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,840
Granted he also believes is
an alien base on the moon.

425
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,050
Then he believes that that's the reason
why they faked the moon landing since,

426
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:59,150
cause they didn't want to go to the
monk cause there's aliens there.

427
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,141
What's the lesson?

428
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:02,860
Is your beliefs to yourself
until you come to the good one?

429
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,273
Awesome.

430
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,620
Well,

431
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,453
what's

432
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,260
is the theory is interesting,

433
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,070
but what's,

434
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,120
what's fascinating about it is
he points to the symbolism in,

435
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,170
um,

436
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:14,710
uh,

437
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,131
the,

438
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:15,280
uh,

439
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,630
jacket,

440
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,463
the shining,

441
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,990
the symbolism and Stanley Kubrick's
version of the shining and how that

442
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:24,730
symbolism directly relates with along
with numbers and all sorts of things that

443
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,220
he changed that directly relate to Apollo,

444
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,540
to the Apollo Moon landings,

445
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,310
including the room,

446
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:34,660
the crazy room where everything happened
is the exact amount of distance between

447
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,650
the earth and the moon.

448
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,371
You know,

449
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:40,330
and then he changed it from what it is
in the book and made it the distance to

450
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,164
the moon,

451
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,441
you know,

452
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:41,810
so,

453
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,860
and then there's all this symbolism
like the boy is wearing that.

454
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:48,850
And Apollo a rocket sweater
in this one particular scene,

455
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:50,410
like I'm not doing it any justice.

456
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,730
It's very,

457
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:56,731
very detailed and it also detailed about
the way that he believes they faked the

458
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:01,180
videos of people on the moon but I
think called front screen projection,

459
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,300
which was a technique that Kubrick used
in 2001 and in this technique is not

460
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:06,971
perfect,

461
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,210
but it's basically the
beginning of green screens.

462
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,920
What they did before they
invented green screen and this,

463
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:16,540
this technique has a telltale like sort
of a line between the boundaries of the

464
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,830
real front,

465
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,370
uh,

466
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,830
the real screen or the real stage rather.

467
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,000
And then the screen behind it,

468
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,790
which is an image which
tries to make it electric,

469
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,320
it's a vast distance when
in reality it's just a wall.

470
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,360
And this telltale line,

471
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,370
he shows it all is a pallet photos.

472
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,710
I mean it's really kind of crazy if you,

473
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,461
if you look at it,

474
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,630
you look at the videos,

475
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:38,770
look at the photos and you know the stills
of the astronauts bouncing around the

476
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,060
moon,

477
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,410
you're like,

478
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,810
that looks exactly like that.

479
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:41,920
This is,

480
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,850
this is it.

481
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,900
To couple that with the fact that the
same background exists in different Apollo

482
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:52,330
moon landing missions and their background
where they're supposed to be miles

483
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,164
away from each other.

484
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,820
They're supposed to be in a
completely different place,

485
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,730
but you have to have the same background
as the price of discrepancies about

486
00:12:57,731 --> 00:12:59,560
when it comes to the imagery
and what he believes.

487
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,240
He believes that people
actually went to the boom,

488
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,220
but when they got there,

489
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,300
the problem was there was aliens there
and he points to the clementine lunar

490
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:07,691
orbiter,

491
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:08,950
which took photographs of uh,

492
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,321
uh,

493
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:14,321
a crater and this crater had a
very distinct like blue dome in it,

494
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,340
you know,

495
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,710
take it on the grant of salt.

496
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,760
But it's interesting just to watch
people go deep into the rabbit hole.

497
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,211
You know what I mean?

498
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:26,410
This guy must suspend a giant chunk of
his life trying to prove that Stanley

499
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,280
Kubrick fake the moon landings.

500
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,451
It's pretty interesting,

501
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:29,180
man.

502
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,910
Might be a hundred percent horseshit.

503
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,193
Interesting.

504
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:32,981
Here's the whole thing.

505
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:36,340
I was thinking the whole time he told
me that extended qubit fake to the moon

506
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:40,480
landings don't you think can be pitching
so much other fake shit like guys,

507
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,320
let's also fake this and like
why would he go to make movies?

508
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:44,891
Um,

509
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:49,660
I think what the idea is is that the
government accordingly with his hypothesis

510
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,700
is that the government wanted
to fake the moon landings.

511
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,950
And what they did was
they came to Kubrick,

512
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,070
they explained to him why they want to
fake the moon landings and they gave him

513
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:00,320
access to all sorts of
scientific information.

514
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:03,820
And cubic is a mathematical genius and
he was obsessed with space flight and it

515
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:04,720
was really like really,

516
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:05,554
really into that shit.

517
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,740
And so what they did was they gave him
access to all of NASA's different studies

518
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:13,390
and NASA is different,

519
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:13,601
you know,

520
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:18,601
technology and allowed him to have like
basically an unlimited budget to produce

521
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,400
this and to produce 2001 a space odyssey.

522
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,670
So you could do them sort
of in conjunction with each
other and the technology

523
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:28,930
that he could use and portraying 2001
he can use it basically the same stuff

524
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,411
and,

525
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:29,671
and,

526
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:32,920
and faking the movement headaches and
they would help him get him rich and give

527
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,150
them access to information.

528
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,960
And his,

529
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,290
this guy's take on it is the
access to information was uh,

530
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,820
the elites of society.

531
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:39,980
The,

532
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,720
the hidden,

533
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,553
you know,

534
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,730
culture that runs the hidden societies
that run our government for real.

535
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,510
And you know,

536
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:46,760
the,

537
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,760
the privileged few like an eyes wide
shut and we know that like was talking to

538
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,290
the skull and bones as long
as weird fucking groups.

539
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,710
Somebody Shit heads get
into at the Bohemian Grove.

540
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,590
You ever seen that stuff?

541
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,980
We're all these elites from all
over the world and me and his son,

542
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,170
they fucking sacrifice in effigy and
they worship this mold left the owl God.

543
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,450
Alex Jones has a whole video where he
snuck into Bohemian Grove and filmed all

544
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,284
this shit.

545
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,683
It's pretty interesting.

546
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,390
What's all,

547
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,170
what else is interesting is that when
he made the movie eyes wide shut,

548
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:19,160
that was his last movie.

549
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,570
That movie was sort of about a lot
of it was about like hidden society.

550
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,060
It's like secret societies shut up.

551
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,570
Yeah.

552
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,403
So he's kind of,

553
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,551
he was a brilliant,

554
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:28,971
brilliant,

555
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,280
brilliant guy and he was also
a brilliant chess player.

556
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,750
And what they think is that he did
it was like he hit a lot of things,

557
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,100
symbolism and,

558
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:37,881
and you know,

559
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,660
in different imagery in,

560
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,870
in the movie to sort of tell a story.

561
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,250
And this guy breaks it down.

562
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:43,671
Of course.

563
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:44,320
It's just,

564
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
it's hypothesis.

565
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,780
It could be a hundred percent horse shift.

566
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,540
Yeah.

567
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,380
But it's interesting.

568
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,480
So see it or not,

569
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,333
I don't give a fuck.

570
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,803
Ah,

571
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,471
Bert Bert,

572
00:15:53,471 --> 00:15:57,760
bert.com leads gentlemen
B e r t three times

573
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,951
oculus.

574
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:00,590
Yeah.

575
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,930
I follow him on Twitter.

576
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,080
Thanks.

577
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,900
Well thank you.

578
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,733
Always good time.

579
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,430
We hugged it out.

580
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,280
Powerful Ra should fear
done with doing the podcast.

581
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,120
Good Times as usual.

582
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,890
It was one probably like the 10th time.

583
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,701
No more than that.

584
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:21,030
You've done it.

585
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,863
How many times you don't know.

586
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,703
I've just done it.

587
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,720
We've done it a hundred
and how many of them Brian?

588
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,630
Hiring 40 or 740 something like that,

589
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,960
but there's a few early on to,

590
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,210
or we were just doing on the couch.

591
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:30,600
Right.

592
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,450
We all like lean back and pretend
we're comfortable with and couch sucks.

593
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,323
It's totally cool.

594
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,980
It's just like so much smarter use
office chairs when you think about it.

595
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:40,050
Who sits up straight all day for office?

596
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:43,950
People going to use office chairs and
that'll catch your head is in my room now.

597
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,970
Which saying?

598
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,803
Yeah,

599
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,050
we recycle here.

600
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,943
Death Squad.

601
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:48,990
It was,

602
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,730
it was blocking my other cousins and such
a board or just blocked my like hell,

603
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:52,620
it's for like a year.

604
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,071
Really?

605
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:54,630
I just put it in front of the other couch.

606
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,580
And then what'd you do eventually?

607
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,660
He got rid of the old couch.

608
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:57,870
No,

609
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,430
I moved them to this
space for a while now.

610
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,700
Oh,

611
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,533
that's all you had to do?

612
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,700
I haven't been to your place.

613
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,803
Which court?

614
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,170
Okay.

615
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,070
What was I going to to hell?

616
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,760
Relationship.

617
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,390
My leg.

618
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,180
Why not?

619
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,521
What is it?

620
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:09,210
Arm.

621
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:09,600
I got you.

622
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,470
I got to vaporizers.

623
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,020
I gotta.

624
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,853
I gotta get that.

625
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,550
Nice.

626
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,383
Give one a charity.

627
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,360
I think I got to donate to the
little bit of comedy store.

628
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,463
That's a good move.

629
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,810
As we look at those attachments,

630
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:22,150
people break those dose and
no one will ever donate it.

631
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:23,150
Then once fucks it,

632
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,731
we'll just give it to it.

633
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:24,564
They might,

634
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,170
they might.

635
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,740
They might say like,

636
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:25,841
Oh,

637
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:26,311
well we're done here.

638
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,310
Let's get another with your San Diego
sounded real profit right now they're

639
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:31,080
closing down all the pawn
shops from San Diego.

640
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,353
It scares me.

641
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:32,941
Well,

642
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:33,391
San Diego,

643
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:34,290
Super Republican.

644
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,090
Donald Rumsfeld lives down there.

645
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,280
Apparently this a corona.

646
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,610
There's this,

647
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,510
the city of Corona.

648
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,800
It's like a corona islands,

649
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,850
like the little peninsula.

650
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,960
It's like one of the most wealthy
towns in America and Donald,

651
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:46,980
the middle one of those there.

652
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,870
They don't want to know
pot anywhere near San.

653
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,760
It's a lot of Republicans,

654
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:51,151
San Diego,

655
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:52,670
a lot of military to really?

656
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,140
Yeah.

657
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,973
Yeah.

658
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,410
Everybody loves Pato.

659
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,040
Even down there.

660
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,120
Especially now when I they do,

661
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,050
of course you do this,

662
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,060
this conservative people down there,

663
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,110
they just don't want it and you know
there's a lot of those fucking guys with

664
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:03,944
their mustache,

665
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,970
my fucking neighborhood.

666
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,163
You know,

667
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
they was just progress.

668
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,190
I've get that.

669
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,480
I get when there's a dispensary,

670
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,760
if near a neighborhood and you buy
something you want to like go around the

671
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,594
corner and smoke.

672
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,750
I'm like I don't want to
smoke or for something.

673
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,593
Somebodies yard.

674
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:17,970
It's true.

675
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,803
This is the problem.

676
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,020
Yeah.

677
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,890
That is the problem.

678
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,341
Yeah.

679
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,031
That is the problem.

680
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:24,120
The problem is when it's too near
residential or can your school,

681
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,770
some people want to argue with that.

682
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,771
I was real close to the drug store to
school but also not really that close and

683
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,160
people aren't doing stuff there.

684
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,701
Yeah,

685
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:33,391
exactly.

686
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:36,750
And very few people are in a drug
store anywhere on Ventura Boulevard.

687
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,890
I shouldn't say that cause they might,

688
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,380
it's probably a lot of people that get
their prescriptions and just fucking Jack

689
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,060
right in the parking lot and know
failing an oxycontin thing probably.

690
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:45,930
Actually that's really normal.

691
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,261
Yeah.

692
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,220
They pop those bitches.

693
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,710
Could anywhere material
and he's busy street.

694
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:49,891
It's like,

695
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:50,041
yeah,

696
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,520
that's fine.

697
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,353
That's totally fine.

698
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,340
Malls should have punch ups.

699
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,330
They should.

700
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,690
Yeah,

701
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,523
those fucks.

702
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,380
Someone's going to make a fortune
putting a pot shop in the mall.

703
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:58,810
Do,

704
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,260
are you going to make a
fortunate that someday?

705
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,660
Do you worry about this backlash?

706
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:04,770
All the shit that's going on right now,

707
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:06,390
they're trying to close pot stores.

708
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,350
A lot of times it gets,

709
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,780
it gets to be really inflammatory that
people send a good closing shops left and

710
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:10,971
right.

711
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:11,251
And I'm like,

712
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,084
hold on.

713
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,200
The only news I really heard is they're
sending out 16 letters and they're

714
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:16,800
shutting down.

715
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,860
They're giving those 16 stores
45 days and make no arrests,

716
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,120
45 days shut down.

717
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:22,850
And only 16 out of the thousands that are,

718
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,220
you know that story when they
came to me there was no one left.

719
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,370
Yeah,

720
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,203
absolutely.

721
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,830
But like I don't know exactly why and
what they mean when they say not operating

722
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,180
in the state laws.

723
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,051
Yeah.

724
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:34,590
Well you're,

725
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,330
you have a real good point about people.

726
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,040
I'm reactionary.

727
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,730
There's one where like the end
is near or at worst that too,

728
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:44,940
but also a what you were talking about
how they're supposed to be nonprofit.

729
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:45,870
That's,

730
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,340
none of them are nonprofit
out there making crazy cash.

731
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,920
They have employees that you'd like that.

732
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:50,491
I get that,

733
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:54,370
but it would change the
real change if you know,

734
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,590
Paul was fucking afraid.

735
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,080
Oh,

736
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,940
it'd be the real change.

737
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,120
Or if you only paid enough to my rowing

738
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,020
fruit.

739
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,320
Yeah,

740
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,061
if I was free,

741
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,020
that would be the real change.

742
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:07,560
It's everybody just had pot and you
just gave people things for pot was like

743
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:12,561
some sort of a weird barter system or
you got paid to grow pot just enough so

744
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:13,494
that you,

745
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,891
you know,

746
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,640
would you be able to get it around?

747
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,550
It's really good to the supermarket.

748
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,450
Why not?

749
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:18,960
Why not?

750
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,130
Why not just come by?

751
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,920
But the idea that you could get paid
just enough to justify you growing it,

752
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,620
but you couldn't get Bentley money.

753
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,261
Like you know,

754
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:29,800
that's what you have to get somebody
going to run the whole dispensary pay the

755
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:32,190
more they don't just get
just enough to get by.

756
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,470
Well that's part of this whole thing
that's like a hundred grand a year.

757
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,161
That's a business.

758
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,210
That's the person that's running it.

759
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:36,810
Right.

760
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,970
What about the profit for
the actual business itself?

761
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,330
How much whatever you want to
make with a regular business.

762
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,230
I don't know how much it's a nightmare.

763
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,190
President of Nike made a shit load.

764
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,710
Yeah,

765
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,440
he should.

766
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,280
She started Nike.

767
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:48,611
Go ahead.

768
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:50,350
And you make a slippery slope,

769
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:50,531
right?

770
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:53,290
Once you give up anything when
it's really not for profit,

771
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,390
what's for what purpose anyway,

772
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,260
but the way it's written,

773
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,700
it is I think any medical drug,

774
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:58,450
it's for profit.

775
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:58,780
Right?

776
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,090
So like what is this nonprofit?

777
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,440
I guess the idea is to protect the
people problem the first place.

778
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,131
Yeah,

779
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:06,760
but they are there.

780
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,031
Yeah.

781
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:10,750
But tomatoes aren't like profitable the
way marijuana is probably the wrong and

782
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:11,680
it's not patentable.

783
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,420
And since it's a psychoactive substance,

784
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,180
I think they feel like anything
psychoactive they have to control.

785
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,410
You know,

786
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,060
I feel like,

787
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,280
you know,

788
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,590
if they have some things that are
psychoactive that they control,

789
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:21,990
if other ones they don't control it,

790
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,190
I think maybe get a little
testy about that shit.

791
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,890
And then I think pharmaceutical
companies would get testy about it.

792
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:30,190
I think they put a lot of pressure on
politicians and that's where all the shit

793
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:30,760
comes from.

794
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,391
It's a direct,

795
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,830
it's not a result of the people.

796
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,030
There's a White House website.

797
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,160
We can uh,

798
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,950
asking,

799
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,300
you know,

800
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,690
what was your question
is the most important?

801
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,620
Quit number one by far is
why isn't it marijuana legal?

802
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,461
That's number one.

803
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:42,701
It's like,

804
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,690
quit oppressing me.

805
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:43,991
You know,

806
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:44,561
this bothers,

807
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:46,840
nobody bothers nobody around me.

808
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,760
So like stop,

809
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:49,540
leave me alone.

810
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm not doing anything to anyone.

811
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,400
Yeah,

812
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,270
me knees,

813
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,970
government meanies cut that shit out.

814
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,230
Yo were hip to you.

815
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,120
We know it's done it.

816
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,860
We're all just people stupid.

817
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,270
Get it together because it's
something in ice water and stay black.

818
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,100
Duncan Trussell to
fisting with flashlights,

819
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,940
Uno jokes.

820
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,660
One of them is going to stuff up as,

821
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:14,381
but now,

822
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:17,140
now that's not the proper
use of these things.

823
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,580
These are sex tools,

824
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:19,540
not sex toys.

825
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:19,801
Yeah,

826
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:19,981
we've,

827
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:20,160
we've,

828
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,250
we've got rid that today.

829
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,880
It's probably a bit in that sex tools,

830
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,103
not toys,

831
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,040
toys and a purpose.

832
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,560
They just don't do any open up for me.

833
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:30,760
I'll kill my fleshlight material.

834
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,530
I won't.

835
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,363
All right.

836
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,040
Which one is 10 minutes on the
flush letting you do that shit.

837
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,480
What's this one model act?

838
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,820
Exact same video as we did
last time you were here.

839
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,220
I gave him a flashlight to what happens?

840
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,020
Women throw them out.

841
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,430
That's what happens.

842
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,620
Yeah.

843
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,870
Flashlights laying around your house.

844
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,360
Chicks fine and they go with Fuck Dunkin.

845
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,170
They need to make it.

846
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,340
They need to make it safe.

847
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,780
Special fleshlight safe with the
code and it looks like a golf club.

848
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,393
You know,

849
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,710
it's like something
that wouldn't throw out.

850
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,010
You need to put a Paki
in its pocket and it's,

851
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,310
he puts Siri in it and then not have
it be like a voice to your flesh.

852
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,950
So you talk to your flashlight.

853
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,400
Tell me I'm good.

854
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,001
Oh baby,

855
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,030
I'm sucking your cock.

856
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,240
I bet they will have that.

857
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,460
They'll have like to,

858
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:23,800
they don't leave an iPhone
sleeve for your flashlight.

859
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,480
I can't believe they
just put headphones on.

860
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,973
You know,

861
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,110
and you can actually
even watch a video too.

862
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,390
You could have it hooked
up to an Ipad as well.

863
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,490
So you're watching a
porno video on the IPAD.

864
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,900
Do you know they have a Chinese,

865
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,680
um,

866
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,700
Dick Sucking robot.

867
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,960
They came in with a robot.

868
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,080
They call it like a
seaman extraction device,

869
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,680
but it's essentially like this tall and
feel like a tube and it sucks in your

870
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,160
consciousness.

871
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,330
That's probably horrendously rude.

872
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,270
Ten five feels terrible.

873
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,403
But they have it.

874
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,310
Course.

875
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,143
I'm surprised they don't.

876
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,740
I'm surprised it blow job robotics
hasn't isn't like a huge industry.

877
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,041
Well,

878
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,520
the Siri thing is going
to change all that.

879
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,230
And the only thing,

880
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,100
I think so everyone wants to fuck Syria
like so many of my friends want to fuck.

881
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:05,270
That's what Brian wants.

882
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,133
Syrian.

883
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,070
It's his voice.

884
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,113
Yeah.

885
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:08,990
Okay.

886
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,823
Steve Jobs,

887
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,341
I think,

888
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:12,500
I think the logical thing
is to change the voice.

889
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,281
The Steve Jobs,

890
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:16,730
since he died like one week before
Siri was announced or released.

891
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,580
Yeah.

892
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,810
Why does it have to be a robot voice?

893
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:22,610
Can you adjust the voice that he
died the day after it was announced?

894
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,150
Yeah.

895
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,630
The day after he missed.

896
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,580
That was the first speech that he never
gave the keynote speech or whatever it

897
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:29,791
was,

898
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:33,240
whatever big announcement speech Kim
Cook Tim Cook did and then he died.

899
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,290
They have different voices
in different countries,

900
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,740
so they have a like an Australian
voice and a British voters.

901
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,710
Those.

902
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,981
Yeah,

903
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:44,030
but I guess they don't work as good
like because he doesn't understand your

904
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:46,370
accent and words like languages,

905
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,300
like Australians,

906
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,340
like say pubs or whatever they say.

907
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:49,611
Right,

908
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:49,871
right,

909
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:50,080
right.

910
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,500
They have a bunch of
different shit going on.

911
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,453
Oh,

912
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,580
you're obsessed with that,

913
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:53,870
huh?

914
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,703
You're obsessed with Siri.

915
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,700
It's fun to play with.

916
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,533
I want to get it.

917
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,370
Hmm.

918
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,203
I want one too,

919
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,790
but you have a droid fucking me,

920
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,110
man.

921
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,740
I'm losing my words now.

922
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,633
What happened?

923
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,730
I love the Troy.

924
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,821
What happens,

925
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:09,700
how you're telling me it's the most
amazing fun of all time and I went around

926
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:13,710
and I fucking razzed iPhone owners
and I'm like the droids batter,

927
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,650
but it sucks,

928
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:14,861
man.

929
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,840
It's like they did a software update,

930
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,960
so now it's gone back to like an
ancient voicemail from months ago.

931
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:23,680
I just decided to do that random times.

932
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:28,681
Pandora will turn on at random fucking
times and also it reconfigured my address

933
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,970
book so I have problems
finding phone numbers.

934
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,991
It was a software up.

935
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:32,650
They fucked,

936
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,350
fucked everything.

937
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,720
Fuck that software update.

938
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:36,760
Once a blackberry killed all my numbers.

939
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:38,380
I lost every number in my fucking phone.

940
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,440
There were all garbled jumble
and half of them were missing.

941
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:41,890
You know,

942
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,610
they're just gone.

943
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:42,941
I was like,

944
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:43,780
what the fuck is this?

945
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,480
I had to let go back to my
computer and start from scratch.

946
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,760
I had a backup.

947
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,361
Yeah,

948
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:49,194
they're done dude.

949
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,540
They have nothing there.

950
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,870
They have these little stupid
devices with buttons on them.

951
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,441
Right.

952
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:55,060
When the new iPhone comes out,

953
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,700
they are surface drops out or what?

954
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:58,400
A disaster.

955
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,181
His ass or,

956
00:25:59,181 --> 00:25:59,740
yeah.

957
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,300
And then it's not just the iPhone anymore.

958
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:01,630
They're good.

959
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,980
That droid bionic now.

960
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,880
Ooh,

961
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,710
I saw what somebody had one
of those other shows weekend.

962
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,970
That's a fucking amazing phone.

963
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,620
What does he do in the camera?

964
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:09,580
Holy Shit Dude.

965
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,500
The camera has so many different options

966
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,153
tomorrow.

967
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,040
New iPhone beat them all works better,

968
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:15,280
right?

969
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,730
No.

970
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,170
Everything text on its
face detection as cropping.

971
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:20,740
It's got,

972
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,750
it doesn't have that
4.5 inch screen though,

973
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:23,480
son.

974
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,313
Yeah,

975
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,961
that big ass.

976
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,830
You know why they did a report of why,

977
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,230
you know the iPhone
isn't gone to that yet,

978
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:32,800
is that the screen is a certain size
of screen that once it gets too big,

979
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,450
you can't do it one handed anymore.

980
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,720
You have to hold with two hands and that's
the size of the iPhone to actually be

981
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,180
the biggest it usually can
get for the average person.

982
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,050
So that makes sense.

983
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:41,980
That totally makes sense.

984
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:44,130
I think it's also a battery life

985
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,401
issue,

986
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:44,641
man.

987
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:45,000
Those,

988
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,790
those droids battery lives
are always out of juice.

989
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:48,331
My droids.

990
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:48,640
Totally.

991
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,830
I got an iPhone now.

992
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,220
Yeah.

993
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,800
I want to get her horizon
and style comedy money.

994
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,860
You've been fucking headline
and comedy clubs down,

995
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:55,290
man.

996
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,280
You're actually working.

997
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:56,701
Yeah,

998
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:57,840
it's an awesome dude.

999
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,680
You're out there headlining on the road,

1000
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:01,011
right?

1001
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:05,850
It's you just also launched yourself
into a professional comics 10 scally APA.

1002
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:06,241
Thank you.

1003
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:06,990
I love you.

1004
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,500
Start off needed one so badly mad.

1005
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,363
You needed one.

1006
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,890
An agent that you weren't talented.

1007
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,940
What kind of car you gotta get?

1008
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,840
You gotta get a car?

1009
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,170
Yeah,

1010
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,220
start with the car for it.

1011
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,530
I've seriously thought of that.

1012
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,941
I think that,

1013
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:21,750
uh,

1014
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,090
I think that when I finally
do get that fucking car,

1015
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,920
we're going to have a long conversation.

1016
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,350
I'll get you that helped me
pick one out or something.

1017
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:29,730
I don't know what kind
of car when I can't,

1018
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,600
I'm not a car guy.

1019
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,433
So it's like,

1020
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,200
well,

1021
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,490
um,

1022
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,050
was a mini Cooper too expensive?

1023
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:34,920
Is that was the deal with that?

1024
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,600
Like the one that you have
for while the lease expired?

1025
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,010
Those are good cars though.

1026
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,290
Why not just get one of those?

1027
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,390
Because they're a,

1028
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,321
I've thought about it.

1029
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:47,570
Like I used to love mini coopers
and this sounds so weird and maybe,

1030
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:48,841
I'm sorry to say it,

1031
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:53,841
but like I think like a really
nice comfortable fucking
like car driving through

1032
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:56,910
traffic freaks me out.

1033
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,730
Driving through traffic in La makes
me think it's the end of the world.

1034
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,830
I feel like having nervous breakdowns,

1035
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:05,970
you look at it all these fucking shitty
vans and then you feel like you're right

1036
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:08,550
at the first episode of the walking dead.

1037
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,990
Like everything's about to fall apart.

1038
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:12,970
So I want some kind of
giant comfort bubble.

1039
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,010
Like Ford Edge.

1040
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,431
Yeah.

1041
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,360
If I've got to go,

1042
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,370
go rolling through hell,

1043
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,090
was that what you have?

1044
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,570
Yeah,

1045
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,230
yeah,

1046
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,471
yeah.

1047
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:22,560
Something that's just like makes you
forget for a second year or something.

1048
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:22,890
Nice.

1049
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,723
Yeah.

1050
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,420
So,

1051
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,110
okay.

1052
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,540
Years in five years now,

1053
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:27,841
I don't know.

1054
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:28,531
How am I going to take two?

1055
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:30,540
I'm not going to get into
debt for a car as a thing.

1056
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:35,110
I never want to do at least two or
$300 a don't want to lease smart.

1057
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,780
They're smart.

1058
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,460
You know,

1059
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,340
brought the money to buy a car right now.

1060
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:42,210
You should at least get your car fixed
once you get it fixed so you can drive

1061
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,044
it.

1062
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,951
They can do that.

1063
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:46,390
You can try everyone really rough.

1064
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,260
Does it?

1065
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,720
Totally stop it.

1066
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,231
They fix cars.

1067
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,730
You don't have to throw them
away when they break down.

1068
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,970
They're all green with Kasi stairs.

1069
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,550
Oh,

1070
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,480
maybe I'll get it fixed.

1071
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,140
Duncan Trussell does not have a car.

1072
00:28:56,141 --> 00:28:56,801
Like he doesn't have a car.

1073
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:57,190
I have a car.

1074
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,841
I have a fall though.

1075
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:00,770
89 what's important is
Duncan trussell's now baller,

1076
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,500

1078
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,124

1079
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,660

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,310
God bless here and giving him occupation.

1081
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,413
Thank you.

1082
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,883
They shit.

1083
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,970
What is this?

1084
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,230
This looks like flashlights.

1085
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,100
They must be yours.

1086
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:17,980
Sweet.

1087
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,880
Let me just smuggled out with my office.

1088
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,810
Right.

1089
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,643
Cuddle.

1090
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,270
Cuddle them so I can have lucid dream.

1091
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,050
I got the last thing.

1092
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,710
Is it really more up to them now?

1093
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,730
Do you think that your woman's
going to have any issue with those?

1094
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:31,470
Cause we have had friends that we give
them to them and then Duncan Trussell

1095
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,760
their girlfriend throws them away.

1096
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,380
Oh really?

1097
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,740
Yeah.

1098
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:33,960
Yeah.

1099
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,950
I don't think mine is that kind of girl.

1100
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,671
I think she's going to go.

1101
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,500
Can you use the butt end
of this flashlight for me?

1102
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,880
Stick it up your ass.

1103
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,210
Well I have to so we got to fill fast bro.

1104
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,990
That's like a fist of iron.

1105
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,530
That's about it.

1106
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:44,980
I get it.

1107
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,801
I get one in a quarter.

1108
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:45,880
Yeah.

1109
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,530
So God damn son,

1110
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,880
why do you think I'm with anyway?

1111
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,740
Because you like big butts
and put it in the man hours,

1112
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:50,981
man.

1113
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:51,100
I,

1114
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,740
that's all me.

1115
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,541
That's all my stretch.

1116
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,910
So that's the problem.

1117
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,570
And have a stretch problems right
out when she has an accident.

1118
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:58,900
Launching out.

1119
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,950
How's the new things
that's supposed to be good?

1120
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,730
The new thing,

1121
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,120
the thing,

1122
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,953
the movie,

1123
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,450
it looks all right looking
for a movie tonight.

1124
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,400
I just have you seen drive?

1125
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,200
Yes.

1126
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,810
You like it?

1127
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,643
I liked it.

1128
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,040
So she has a little bit of a
problem with extreme violence.

1129
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,660
That's a tough one to
watch and mixed company.

1130
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:17,890
Now if I was with my friends,

1131
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:18,724
probably enjoyed it more.

1132
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,840
What did I see last night?

1133
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,020
I saw the um,

1134
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,020
the tower heist with Eddie Murphy.

1135
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,913
How was that?

1136
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,790
It was okay.

1137
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,790
I had pretty next to nothing
expectations and I enjoyed the movie.

1138
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,721
Like I enjoyed it.

1139
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:32,440
It's Eddie Murphy back to dropping f bombs
and being Eddie Murphy and they still

1140
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,940
are not playing Ben Stiller.

1141
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:35,260
He playing a little bit
different of a role,

1142
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:38,530
which is nice and it's a lot of
corporate groups about the corporate guys

1143
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:40,080
fucking do a little more little suckers.

1144
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,700
And then it turns into like a
family friendly comedy at the end.

1145
00:30:42,701 --> 00:30:43,534
But other than that,

1146
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,190
it's pretty sweet.

1147
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,900
Kevin Pereira joins us from the podcast
freshly from one of our best podcasts

1148
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:50,240
I've got to say to do.

1149
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,770
We've done two so far and
they're both fucking awesome man.

1150
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:57,660
You got such a wide variety of interests
and viewpoints and you got a little bit

1151
00:30:57,661 --> 00:30:59,340
of crazy conspiracy theorist in you,

1152
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:01,260
but realist along with it.

1153
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:01,891
It's not the,

1154
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:04,890
you're not reaching a healthy dose of a
tin foil hat is sometimes a good thing.

1155
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,360
Have you ever sat down with Alex Jones?

1156
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,350
Have you ever had him on your show?

1157
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,631
I,

1158
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:07,991
you know what,

1159
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,681
I tweeted out,

1160
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,960
I wanted to interview him and I
tweeted out one of his articles and,

1161
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,550
and he was such a polarizing character
that the backlash from tweeting that out

1162
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,050
made people not want to listen to
the message I was trying to give.

1163
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,580
So I'm a little reluctant from that,

1164
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:19,000
but,

1165
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,940
but what I have seen from
him at times is this so far,

1166
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:22,774
pretty interesting to me.

1167
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,270
What about if I had him
come on or as a podcast?

1168
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:28,120
I think you would be the
perfect counterpoint.

1169
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,800
Would you sit in and have us off podcast?

1170
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,300
I'd love to.

1171
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,560
Alex Jones here.

1172
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,040
Okay.

1173
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,000
With Kevin Pereira.

1174
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:39,000
Kevin is from g four attack of the show.

1175
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:43,680
Attendees of the show is
a new world order device.

1176
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,440
What they're doing is
softening up the idea.

1177
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,660
It's attack gets attack of the show.

1178
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,070
We're all friends here.

1179
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,720
Uh,

1180
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:50,930
I,

1181
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,700
we are owned happily buy in

1182
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,320
via Comcast,

1183
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:56,080
so general electric,

1184
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,020
they're shooting fucking bombs.

1185
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,420
He goes Kennison Anya,

1186
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,203
he's amazing.

1187
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,400
Happily chat with him.

1188
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:03,911
He's awesome.

1189
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:05,020
We got that with him in Texas.

1190
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:05,980
He came to the fights.

1191
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,581
We,

1192
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:06,701
uh,

1193
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:10,570
we had Margaritas during the day with
Alex and then we went to the UFC that

1194
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:10,720
night.

1195
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,680
I didn't get to hang with them,

1196
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,600
but Joey Diaz gave him a pot cookie
and put them on the fucking moon.

1197
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,463
Oh.

1198
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,351
Allegedly.

1199
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:16,890
Allegedly.

1200
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,540
He actually said on a show the next day
that he has smoked pot with me once a

1201
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,230
year just to try it out and see
if I'm in the decriminalization.

1202
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,671
So good.

1203
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:26,830
Good

1204
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,311
for him,

1205
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,144
man.

1206
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,750
It's true.

1207
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,081
It's true.

1208
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,760
Once a year I come into town and I get,

1209
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:30,940
we,

1210
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,050
we could smoke a little weed.

1211
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,770
I love it.

1212
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,170
Does it,

1213
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,440
does the polarizing nature of his
character concern you in terms of aligning

1214
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,870
yourself?

1215
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,560
No,

1216
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,190
I'm it much who I am.

1217
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,870
I don't think anybody has any questions,

1218
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:42,141
you know,

1219
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:43,550
I mean anybody who knows me,

1220
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:45,100
they know me from the podcast.

1221
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,330
Right.

1222
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,310
You're not going to,

1223
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,930
I don't think it's confusing.

1224
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,490
I think I find a lot of what
he says fascinating and I
don't buy into all of it,

1225
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,660
but I to buy into something of it.

1226
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,210
He's got a great video on what
we're talking about tonight,

1227
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,670
but provoca tourists or,

1228
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:57,840
yeah,

1229
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,070
we was talking about um,

1230
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,350
the uh,

1231
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,360
the um,

1232
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:01,940
protest,

1233
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,720
the WTO protests in Seattle and uh,

1234
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,690
how it was set up where these military
people would come in and it caused

1235
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:11,000
violence and they were wearing
like ski masks and Shit.

1236
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,870
They were breaking windows,

1237
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,390
they were wearing fucking military
issue boots and they want up getting,

1238
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,160
they want of going into a safe
house and then they get a,

1239
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,441
they,

1240
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:20,330
the cops negotiate with them
and they let them all go.

1241
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:20,670
Yeah,

1242
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,860
I mean it's like,

1243
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:22,671
it's so gross.

1244
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:24,290
He documents it in great detail.

1245
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,920
There's videos from occupy where,

1246
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,760
where people are in the crowd,

1247
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:27,301
they're screaming,

1248
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:29,340
they're trying to rile up the people in
the frontline as they're approaching the

1249
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:29,970
riot cops.

1250
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,360
The riot cops step aside after telling
people you can not go down the street.

1251
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,120
And a line of eight of them walks
right on through the police line.

1252
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,120
Then they close up and not
arrested the dudes that walk on by,

1253
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:40,740
but they look like plain
clothes protestors.

1254
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:41,820
That's already happened.

1255
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,680
It's already happened.

1256
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,990
The what is the justification?

1257
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,470
How do they sleep at night knowing that
they're doing that kind of shit and just

1258
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:50,071
doing that job,

1259
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:50,370
man,

1260
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,440
that's like Nazi Germany Shit,

1261
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:52,651
man.

1262
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:53,311
That's like Earl.

1263
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:53,631
Well,

1264
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:53,811
yeah,

1265
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:54,101
and it's,

1266
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:54,351
it's,

1267
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:59,160
it's creepy that you can get an
American citizen to trick other American

1268
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:00,030
citizens like that.

1269
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,133
But again,

1270
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,600
we talked about desensitization.

1271
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,443
They don't see,

1272
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,340
they don't see Americans.

1273
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,180
I don't see you and I potentially,

1274
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,030
they see dog.

1275
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:10,320
They see rabid dogs who are
uneducated and hippies and x,

1276
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:10,801
y and z.

1277
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,750
That's what they see and they're
just getting their paycheck.

1278
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,930
They're just motherfuckers
see were riled up again.

1279
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,140
Oh,

1280
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,570
this is the time clutching
flashlights and health of brain,

1281
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:21,060
so clearly I'm in the
right minds or credibility.

1282
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,260
Clearly I'm in the riots.

1283
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,330
Substantially undermines your credibility.

1284
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,160
Anyway.

1285
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,540
Follow Kevin on Twitter.

1286
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,710
It's p.

K.

1291

K.

1292

P.

R.

1295
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:34,330
E.

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:34,330
I.

1297
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:34,330
R.

1298
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:34,330
A.

1299
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:34,380
Right?

1300
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:34,501
Yeah.

1301
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:35,730
I got to get an easier one than that.

1302
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,001
Yeah,

1303
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:36,481
that's hard.

1304
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:38,490
Perera should have it spelled like career,

1305
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:39,670
like Porsche went through days.

1306
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,740
Carrera Perrera.

1307
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,500
Is it Portuguese?

1308
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,170
Yeah.

1309
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:42,720
I can't look it up.

1310
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,553
What the guests,

1311
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,700
how do you say it in Portuguese you
got say it with a mouthful of bread and

1312
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:49,610
angrily then it's Portuguese.

1313
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,950
That's only once you get for tie down.

1314
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,860
A mouthful of octopus soup is regularly
different than Brazilian Portuguese.

1315
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,140
Is it a different way
of pronouncing things?

1316
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,621
I mean,

1317
00:34:58,621 --> 00:34:59,101
I think there's,

1318
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:00,400
there's like a region,

1319
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,710
regional dialects and whatnot,

1320
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:03,450
but it's still fundamentally
the same language.

1321
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:04,410
It just put a little spin on it.

1322
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,460
Brazil is so strange,

1323
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:05,701
man.

1324
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:06,540
What a crazy country.

1325
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,660
They speak Portuguese in
their middle South America,

What's the meaning of life?

1337
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,710
Try and be nice to people.

1338
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,910
Avoid eating fat.

1339

Get some walking and tried
to live together in peace
and harmony with people of

Oh my God.

1343

I'm walking in and read
a book once in a while.

1344
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,280
How?

1345
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,250
Say that I won't eat fat.

1346
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,650
