1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,281
He travels,

3
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:02,961
he's worldwide.

4
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:03,721
I won't lie to you.

5
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:04,740
I travel a great deal.

6
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,590
What were we talking about right before
the podcast started where it says you

7
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,320
have to set and you have to bring
this up on the podcast about about,

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,490
um,

9
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,870
so I did a podcast today with a guy from
cracked.com Dan O'brian wrote a really

10
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,630
funny book called how to fight presidents.

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,200
He literally took every president in
the history of America to see who is the

12
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:25,891
baddest ass,

13
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,920
who's the one guy you wouldn't want to
fight and who would win in a fight if

14
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,000
they were pitted against each other.

15
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,670
It's like it's in some ways
the greatest book of all time.

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,110
And like I said,

17
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:34,560
I go,

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,040
this is the,

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,690
this is going to be the
greatest podcast both times.

20
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,950
It was the funniest thing because we got
to know a heavy heated argument about

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,390
who would win in a fight.

22
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,210
And you got to put a couple of
presidents up at the top of the list.

23
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,330
You got to put a Blinken cause he was
renowned for his physical strength.

24
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:48,690
There it is.

25
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,260
It's a thug.

26
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,520
He fought vampires to right.

27
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,091
Well,

28
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:51,924
he did,

29
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,860
but he used the movie.

30
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,843
He used an ax,

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,960
but Abe Lincoln was six,

32
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,130
four and had,

33
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:58,260
what's that disease where
your arms are longer,

34
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,310
you have really long arms,

35
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,140
like longer than your
body had crazy island.

36
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,740
And he was,

37
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,240
he was known to be really strong and,

38
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,981
and very,

39
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,640
very tough.

40
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,530
Acute [inaudible] I'm starting
to also want to say was,

41
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,480
I think you also have to think of
people that lived during that era.

42
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,410
There were a lot tougher.

43
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,420
They grew up doing
everything with their hands,

44
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:15,691
right.

45
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:16,524
Building things.

46
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,500
Andrew Jackson was a gentle,

47
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:18,841
I mean,

48
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,940
he committed a little
something called genocide.

49
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,250
And you talked to historians.

50
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,710
They're like,

51
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,000
well,

52
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,610
he killed a great deal of native
Americans with extreme prejudice.

53
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,810
So he hit,

54
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,090
I don't know what he's still,

55
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:30,740
that's not,

56
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,200
I wouldn't,

57
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,100
that's a strong word.

58
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,270
Funny you say,

59
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,400
well,

60
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,233
hold on Steve.

61
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,080
I don't think disease transmission counts.

62
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,153
I agree with you.

63
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,270
Is that what he did leave?

64
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:40,681
He did.

65
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:42,380
He was a soldier and,

66
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,233
and did,

67
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,191
I mean he was,

68
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:44,430
uh,

69
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:44,741
he,

70
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:47,070
he clearly probably killed a
lot of men with his bare hands.

71
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,180
I mean that was bare hands,

72
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,440
but certainly with a gun or a knife.

73
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:53,250
I mean he was a pretty warlike
fella and in fact challenged.

74
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,450
He had a number of duals.

75
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,320
Historians are actually,

76
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,800
uh,

77
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,910
he got shot and live most of his
life with a bullet in his rib cage.

78
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,050
Shitty guns back then,

79
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,880
but he had to clean three.

80
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,480
There's a debate how many
duals he actually had.

81
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,290
When you have,

82
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,890
when there's a debate on how
many duels fucking president,

83
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,140
you're a bad mother
fucker or you're an idiot,

84
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,720
right?

85
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,740
You keep getting a duels.

86
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,030
Well,

87
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,430
he got shot because he let
the guy take the first shot.

88
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:17,941
He goes,

89
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,530
take the first shot guy shot him.

90
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,310
Then he shot the guy and live
that way for the rest of his life.

91
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:23,421
He,

92
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:23,970
he had,

93
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,540
he had a gaping wound that would,

94
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,910
you know,

95
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,520
cause problems periodically
and you take the first shot

96
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,490
you got to Andrew Jackson,

97
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,570
who was 62 he was struck,

98
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,490
he had to be drawn to the George
Washington 64 who was a tough guy.

99
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
George Washington was six four he was,

100
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,690
people weren't that big that
they know he was a giant.

101
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,940
I'll tell you six for Jesus Christ.

102
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:45,774
George Washington was,

103
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,633
it's a small solar,

104
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,493
so it's yours.

105
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,343
Washer could have beat

106
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,330
my money on Doug.

107
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,620
George has wooden teeth.

108
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:54,080
He's got a fucking goofy wig on.

109
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,290
You pull that wig off.

110
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,610
He's all insecure about his hair.

111
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,471
Yeah,

112
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,500
you pull that off.

113
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,830
He's not going to know
what the fuck to do.

114
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:01,990
He's going to search for his wig.

115
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,860
You kick him in the Dick.

116
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,821
Next thing you know,

117
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,890
you're pulling out his wooden teeth
and beating the shit out of him.

118
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,873
Got My money on.

119
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,290
But then there was Lyndon Johnson who's
also six four but Teddy Roosevelt who

120
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:11,891
practice,

121
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,724
who boxed,

122
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,850
wrestled and practiced judo with the guy
who brought judo to the United States,

123
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,780
the first judo guy.

124
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,600
And was obsessed with all
things wrestling and fighting.

125
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,530
He was about five,

126
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:24,191
10 and very thick,

127
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,260
but it very sickly kid
died of heart disease.

128
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:26,891
How do we cart?

129
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:27,724
So I don't know.

130
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,330
My thing is Gerald Ford played football
and could have played for the bears as a

131
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,164
middle linebacker.

132
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,030
That says a lot when you play in the NFL.

133
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,480
So I might have to go with a,

134
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,260
we had a huge discussion
about this for a good hour.

135
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,110
I go with Luke Bryan Callen show and a,

136
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:41,740
it was a good time.

137
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,573
I got Lincoln.

138
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,211
So no,

139
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,110
that's not what you were talking about.

140
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,490
What are you talking about?

141
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,571
So then he said,

142
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:46,871
I said,

143
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:48,040
what about Barack Obama?

144
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,790
And he got quiet there.

145
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,890
Dan's a comedian,

146
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:51,670
really good guy.

147
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,800
He got quiet and they said,

148
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:53,021
well,

149
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,740
I can't really,

150
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,041
you know,

151
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,151
I,

152
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:54,321
I,

153
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,270
I'd rather leave that alone.

154
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:55,541
I said,

155
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,051
why?

156
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:56,710
He said,

157
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,981
well,

158
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:57,761
I tried not to,

159
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:01,180
you try not to include any
living presidents because
it causes too much trouble.

160
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:01,931
I said,

161
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,710
what do you mean?

162
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,071
He said,

163
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:03,251
well,

164
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:05,560
I went through sort of a thing about how,

165
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,071
you know,

166
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,550
Barack Obama's not that tough of president
and it'd be easy to kick his ass.

167
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,050
And uh,

168
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,890
you know,

169
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,030
I was doing it tongue and cheek.

170
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,211
You know,

171
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,570
you'd probably kick him here and
he's kind of skinny and you could do,

172
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,910
and he gets a call from the secret
service because he posted it as a blog.

173
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,560
You Post it as a blog
come from cracked.com.

174
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,461
Well,

175
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:28,960
he said the reason the only blog that's
not up there anymore is that because he

176
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,030
got called down to the federal building,

177
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:31,864
I believe.

178
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,250
I think that's what he said.

179
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,210
It's on my podcast.

180
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,520
And he had to go line by line with these
agents on what he meant by what he was

181
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:39,881
saying.

182
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,481
And he was like,

183
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:40,811
well,

184
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,380
I said,

185
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,980
you know,

186
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,980
I said a Dick Tornado instead of a penis
cycling because it's kind of funnier.

187
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,910
He was trying to teach them for humor.

188
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,590
These guys were totally fucked.

189
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,870
He got all nervous.

190
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,250
He was like apologizing.

191
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,030
He made them edit,

192
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,863
take it down.

193
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,850
And it was a chapter that
was isolated from the book.

194
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:58,360
I'd be like,

195
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,620
so that I was like,

196
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,490
we live in America.

197
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,830
How now you have to be careful when
you've threatened the president,

198
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,611
you will get called.

199
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,420
But guys,

200
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,050
guys,

201
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,883
come on.

202
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,053
Come on man.

203
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,661
I mean,

204
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:07,881
and,

205
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:08,530
and he took,

206
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,400
probably we can't,

207
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,660
they probably can't.

208
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,910
Well that's his probably nowhere to go.

209
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,091
Like,

210
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:13,630
yeah,

211
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,620
they probably knew.

212
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,960
Of course he's joking,

213
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,380
but there's a thing that you
set in motion a certain status.

214
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:20,831
What happens?

215
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,261
Because they say,

216
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:21,430
we,

217
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,910
we will subpoena everybody
that made a comment on your,

218
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,990
on the blog,

219
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,220
kick his ass,

220
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,461
and,

221
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:27,661
and,

222
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,090
and,

223
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,721
and Dan said,

224
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,020
well,

225
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,060
it's a bunch of 14 year
olds have fun with that.

226
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,040
And the,

227
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,120
the main guy had called them first.

228
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,331
He goes,

229
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:34,630
look,

230
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,470
I know you're kidding.

231
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,520
I know you got a sense of humor.

232
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,110
You've got to go down
and talk to these guys.

233
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,070
It's just the way it is,

234
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,904
pal.

235
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:49,390
Okay.
