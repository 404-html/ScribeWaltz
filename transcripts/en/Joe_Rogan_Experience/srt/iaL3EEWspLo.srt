1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,360
I don't know if I can handle that,
but the clock's wrong.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,850
I mean just subtly,
subtly,

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,760
and we live.
One of them's wrong.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,730
Which one is it?
I think they're both wrong.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,630
That's all stuff that says 12.
11.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,080
One says 12.
15,

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,450
12,
13 on my 12.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,510
13.
Wrong.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,620
This one says 12 slash 14.
That one says 12.

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,960
11.
I want to strap c four to this.

11
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,610
And this one I want to spike against the
wall.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,850
Are you ocd with time or with
everything?

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,370
With everything.
Yeah,

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,250
like my reloading room is disgustingly
perfect and if I load the dishwasher,

15
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:43,640
all the forks have to be symmetrical in
one side and the spoons have to be in

16
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,500
there.
They're all like all the mugs that tall

17
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,890
ones have to be on one side.
And then I.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,500
Yeah.
Was that all about.

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,580
I Dunno,
I think it came back to um,

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,670
pull this sucker up to your face.

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,800
The uh,
when you,

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,330
when everything's the same and
something's not the same,

23
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,130
it's easy.
It's easiest to see that way.

24
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,650
Right?
So like counterfeiting,

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,370
like if you're,
if you're buying a chick in a 13 year

26
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,970
old girl in Tiawana and you're going to
want to get the guy for counterfeit

27
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,040
money and do you want to get them for
human trafficking?

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,980
Um,
and he starts handing you crappy bills.

29
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,920
The easiest way to spit spot the bills
is to be able to see,

30
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,620
have all of your proper bills all in the
right order.

31
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,810
So the one that's fake is going to stick
out.

32
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:24,950
And they were like,
Oh man,

33
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm only.
You would use that example when you're

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,880
going to tijuana and someone's
trafficking human slavery.

35
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,470
But that's a good example.
Counterfeit money.

36
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:35,930
It is a good example.
And if you have a 13 year old girl with

37
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:38,780
a bunch of 18 year old girls,
you can see that third year old get a

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,600
little bit easier,
right?

39
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,380
Yeah.
So it applies to everything you know.

40
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:44,960
And if you have like 100,
a bunch of,

41
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,170
if you reload and you have a bunch of
grain bullets and you're going to

42
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:50,450
measure and then lock them all point
five,

43
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:53,240
separation and grain.
So it's like one 75,

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,130
75 point five,
one 76,

45
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:59,270
one 74 point five and so on.
When you stack them all together,

46
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:02,900
the easiest way to to group them instead
of measuring every single one is to look

47
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:06,350
at them and just put the ones that are
similarly sized all together,

48
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,290
smallest to largest,
and then you can then you can weigh them

49
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,750
in batches.
Have you always been like this?

50
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,760
I think so with everything.
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:16,160
My mostly.
And what about with like when you were

52
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,790
fighting your training,
did you like map out everything to the

53
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:24,080
wrap up to the detail training notes.
Great.

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,090
Greg,
you,

55
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,310
if you watched some of our fights and I
mean you're a cage side for almost all

56
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:31,460
of mine in the UFC.
You'd hear Greg be like okay,

57
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,440
so that went according to plan or.
All right.

58
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,810
So uh,
let's go ahead and change things up a

59
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,700
little bit because you just got your ass
kicked,

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,220
you know,
and then we'd have to adjust.

61
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,900
He's one of the more interesting corner
guys.

62
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,130
He's so much fun.
Yeah,

63
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,460
he's a,
he enjoys it and he seems to like want

64
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,590
you to enjoy it too.
He's like,

65
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,570
all right.
That went amazing,

66
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,823
you know,
it's like,

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,860
let's get some deep breaths.
You're doing fantastic.

68
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:56,270
Yeah.
In between um,

69
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,340
rounds with Michael Bisbing as a five
round fight.

70
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,030
Um,
he comes in and tells me a,

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,850
he,
he told,

72
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,670
he told me like a knock knock joke and
then why the chicken crossed the road

73
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,730
joke and I sit in there and there's a
picture of me like critically looking at

74
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,564
him,
I'm like,

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,940
I'm going to kill you.
And you're like,

76
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,830
what are you doing?
And he just wanted me to relax.

77
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,620
You just want me to breathe when I was
doing everything that's supposed to be

78
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,000
doing.
And um,

79
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,960
I just needed to,
you know,

80
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,500
he just thought you were too tense.
Yeah,

81
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,230
apparently.
Huh?

82
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,690
Huh?
What a Dick playing mind games in the

83
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:27,230
middle of the middle of a fight.
You have one minute to figure out what

84
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:31,850
to do and what to say to a guy who just
was for five minutes.

85
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,880
Some people have a little more.
Do you know that?

87
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,810
I discussed that yesterday with big John
Big John,

88
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,800
the podcast yesterday.
We fucked up and he forgot to talk about

89
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:43,640
it during the podcast,
but after the podcast he explained what

90
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:48,050
happened.
He says that it was the UFC cut man's

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,860
fault because he left a giant Glob of
vaseline on yokels.

92
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,660
I.
He didn't want to touch it because he

93
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,700
felt like if he touched it could open
the cut up again.

94
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,730
Yeah.
He called,

95
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,260
I guess it was the guys name tate.
He tried to call and get the guy to come

96
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:00,740
back in.

97
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,830
The guy wouldn't come back in,
so the corner men tried to come in.

98
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:04,664
He said,
no.

99
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,440
He's like,
you got to bring the cut and then back

100
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:08,180
and then he wound up doing it by
himself.

101
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,700
It was the perfect storm.
He said he fucked up.

102
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,730
He said Jojo was definitely planted it
off and he said,

103
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:17,660
but if you had to do it differently,
he would have a made you all stand up

104
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,320
and be.
He would have made sure that fucking cut

105
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:24,320
man didn't leave the cage with that big
Glob of asset on the.

106
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:25,540
I was just talking crap.
Oh,

107
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,300
I was actually complaining about.
Yeah,

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,100
it was.
Um,

109
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,420
so,
but that was a giant issue.

110
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:34,400
It was a 32nd 32nd issue for a guy who
was really wobbled at the end of the

111
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:35,080
second round.
Yeah.

112
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,870
And my route to the title.
Yeah,

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,713
it was a big deal.

114
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,280
It was a bummer,
but it was the perfect storm,

115
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,880
you know,
and,

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,713
and,
um,

117
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,120
and now he's fighting for the title,
so,

118
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,130
you know,
hopefully he represents Cuba.

119
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:46,964
Well,

120
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,430
he's a bad motherfucker.
He,

121
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,380
uh,
he's a freak.

122
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,890
He really is right.
Specimen when like,

123
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,800
it's,
there's so much going on there.

124
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:02,040
It's like this,
the years of training in that crazy Cuba

125
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,630
Olympic program,
there's phenomenal genetics is

126
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,280
experience and competing.
There's so much going on there with that

127
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,114
guy.

128
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,310
Layers and layers and layers of the
highest level of competition.

129
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,370
Um,
mixed in with a life that I think has

130
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,820
been very complimentary to a mindset of
an athlete,

131
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:24,871
you know,
he,

132
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,940
he,
he has pretty much been shaped most of

133
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,620
his life to be a highest level athlete.
Um,

134
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,130
tricky part is man whittaker is good.
We're good.

135
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,190
Very good.
He's very good and very young,

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,120
you know,
and uh,

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,750
whitaker you gotta remember had his knee
blown out in the first round.

138
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,610
He got his knee hyperextending tours,
MCL pretty badly in the first round and

139
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:50,370
still was able to stuff take downs and
arguably the best wrestlers ever fought

140
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,480
in mma.
Yeah.

141
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,300
Pretty impressive shit.
That's a great fight.

142
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,590
That's a couple of weeks from now.

143
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,240
Shocker.

144
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,410
And what's his face?
Just fought calvin.

145
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,710
Yeah.
Was it,

146
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,290
are you still,
do you still,

147
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,990
are you like,
you're so close to the division,

148
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,290
you're paying attention to it and you're
just recently retired.

149
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,990
Do you still get itchy?
I,

150
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:15,991
I have a crazy competition bug but not
to fight.

151
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,130
I'm going to do a bunch of Jujitsu this
year.

152
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:23,180
I'm competing in long gun smart marksman
stuff,

153
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,310
a three gun,
um,

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,750
you know,
have you steal stuff.

155
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,650
So what is a long gun?
Is that like,

156
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,830
just like really long range but not.
So there's a bunch of different styles

157
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:36,730
of competitive shooting,
you know,

158
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,250
there's like guys that run around and
shoot around barricades very quickly.

159
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,770
Um,
and then there's kind of a slowing fire

160
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,830
nra style where you're going standing
offhand or weird shooting positions and

161
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,450
then there's,
it doesn't matter,

162
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,090
it just matters how far you can shoot.
That's it.

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
Yeah.
I have a buddy he's into that.

164
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,640
He's into banging steel or like a mile
away or whatever the fuck it is.

165
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,633
That's,
that's it.

166
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,370
Crazy ballistic calculations and
literally calculating the curve of the

167
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:06,390
earth.
Yeah.

168
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,650
Yeah.
Barometric pressure and the temperature

169
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,660
of your ammo to a degree plays a factor.

170
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,350
Sure.
I'm that

171
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,370
every imaginable measurable thing plays
a factor into how the bullet is going to

172
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,340
fly.
That's a,

173
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,260
it's a real touchy subject and hunting
because it's a,

174
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,200
there's a lot of people that are getting
into that with like really long range

175
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,510
shots on animals.
And the question about whether or not

176
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:34,200
it's ethical and who is it ethical for?
I don't.

177
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,680
I don't know where I stand on that.
Um,

178
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,420
I really love.
I,

179
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,920
I bounced between rifle hunting and
bowhunting.

180
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,413
Um,

181
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,060
as a kid.
Maybe the first time that I took a shot,

182
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,650
I wasn't 100 percent positive.
The animal wouldn't just fall over.

183
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,380
Uh,
I mean my dad scuffed me up,

184
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,990
you know,
um,

185
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,710
and I was like 11.
So there has since then been a

186
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,120
preponderance of responsibility has
always been on the hunter to without

187
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,440
question.
No,

188
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,200
the animal is going to fall right then,
right there.

189
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,360
We're not stocking it for two days,
you know,

190
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:15,510
I'm not following a blood trail for nine
hours to see an animal.

191
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:18,660
Hyperventilating.
I'm now the meat's not even good.

192
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,160
Huge adrenaline spike.
You know,

193
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:23,430
it's like right there.
That's your meat and you're going to go

194
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:25,070
get it.
Um,

195
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,240
so that's best case scenario.
But even then animals jumped the string.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,780
And how do you do that when you're
shooting something that the bullet

197
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,520
flight is going to be up for six
seconds,

198
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,900
right?
Yeah.

199
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,370
No,
and I wasn't really that long.

200
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,010
How long has it,
like if you're shooting,

201
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,840
say a thousand yards,
a thousand,

202
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,540
three,
three seconds.

203
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,310
That's a long time.
That is a long time.

204
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,950
Animals can take a couple steps in three
seconds for the hearts.

205
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,980
This big size of two fists.
And that's not lot of margin of error.

206
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,070
The wind changing one mile an hour,
one mile an hour at a thousand at a

207
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,450
thousand yards could,
could make you miss that heart.

208
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,000
Wow.
So yeah,

209
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,170
it's,
it's one of those weird sort of things

210
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:13,940
where people are getting into it because
there's a bragging rights aspect of it.

211
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,430
You know,
he shot this elk at 800 yards and you

212
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,830
know,
most people go 800 yards.

213
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,810
You tell somebody shot some of the 200
yards.

214
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,640
They go,
oh,

215
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,990
so good shot.
That's reasonable ethical.

216
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,420
You know,
if you have your crosshairs on a,

217
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:29,300
an animal's vitals at 200 yards is
basically a dead animal.

218
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,380
Absolutely.
But you get,

219
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,190
you get to like six,
700,

220
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,180
like that's a tiny little spot you're
aiming at.

221
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,470
Now Shit gets wiggly.

222
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,813
Yeah,
I mean,

223
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,970
and yeah,
I think you're a conservationist.

224
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,360
Yes.
I think I'm a conservationist and you

225
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,680
know,
we're,

226
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,700
we're,
we're talking in the tens of millions of

227
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,080
dollars go into conservation from
hunters every single day from,

228
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,180
from hunting and the U,
s,

229
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,340
wildlife,
department of Wildlife.

230
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,360
They don't know how they're going to be
paying for the protection of habitats

231
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,240
without hunting permits because the
number of people that are hunting are

232
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:03,530
shrinking.
So,

233
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:06,500
um,
there's a huge influx in question of

234
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,330
about how moral are different styles of
hunting,

235
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,210
what are the best and how are we going
to make sure that we protect these

236
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,920
animals and protect their habitats.
Um,

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,833
all the while,
you know,

238
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,570
I was telling you about the elk I shot
at the beginning of the year

239
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,520
and I had a,
I had a clean broadside shot at,

240
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,560
at 600 meters and I was like,
I'm shooting a threeway totally,

241
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:31,680
super doable,
you know,

242
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,070
I,
I can,

243
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,320
I can,
I can do that almost in my sleep on my

244
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,270
home range,
but I'm shooting an animal.

245
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,970
And I was like,
Nah man,

246
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,110
I'm,
let me just walk this guy down another

247
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:43,560
ridge.
So move up when I come back down.

248
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,650
And uh,
my neck shot was at like 3:20,

249
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,570
you know,
one shot and he sits down.

250
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,140
So there I think the responsibility
always in all things should fall on the

251
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,870
individual.
Um,

252
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,120
but now it's just getting all the
individuals to actually have

253
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:03,570
responsibility.
That's where it gets really stupid,

254
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,930
really stupid.
There's,

255
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,250
there's just,
there's just people that they're not

256
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,110
good people.
They,

257
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,920
they don't,
they weren't raised well.

258
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,530
Feel good.
Some people in,

259
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,940
in,
in moments.

260
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,250
Yeah.
What do you mean when you say that?

261
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,040
Like my mom and I,
we argue about this a lot.

262
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,580
Like she thinks people are inherently
good,

263
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,360
you know,
and I'm like when you've seen so much of

264
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,680
the bad for.
Yeah,

265
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,870
obviously I'm gonna have a catalyst.
I'm,

266
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm not gonna have the most objective
perspective,

267
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,930
but I'm like,
I want to think people are good.

268
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:40,080
But like I think hunters and jet,
let's just use that as.

269
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,250
Because that's what we're talking about
right now.

270
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,450
Have 100 hunters.
What percentage are going to do the

271
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,820
right thing?
Are going to do the moral thing,

272
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,890
the ethical thing,
the thing that's the best interest for

273
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,290
the animal,
for conservation,

274
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:56,560
for nature out of,
out of 100.

275
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,850
You know,
if they're on a hunt,

276
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,550
did they say

277
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,290
for sure the majority.
And now it gets down to guesswork as to

278
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,720
what the numbers are,
but I like 60 percent.

279
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,060
I'd say more.
It's,

280
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,890
I would like to think.
I like to think it's in the seventies or

281
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:11,770
eighties.
I wish it was 100 for sure.

282
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,470
No,
I don't wish anything other than that.

283
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:17,360
It was just a mistake.
But there's gonna be people that poach.

284
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,730
It's going to be people that cross
property boundaries when they know

285
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:22,100
they're not supposed to.
It's going to be people that shoot an

286
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:26,750
animal when the season opens tomorrow
morning and they get there a day early

287
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,100
and they see an animal and they just
say,

288
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:29,540
fuck it.
I'm just going to shoot it and hang it

289
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,310
and say I shot at the next day.
There's like gray area stuff where

290
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,120
you're,
you're definitely doing something

291
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,070
illegal,
but it's still haunting.

292
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,990
You still have a tag,
you know,

293
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,290
and it still people bending the rules
like when.

294
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,850
And then there's people that just,
you know,

295
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,270
they'll shoot two,
three animals and the only supposed to

296
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,750
shoot one,
they'll hide the meat.

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,670
Uh,
there's,

298
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,480
there's,
there's always going to be people like

299
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,490
that.
Assholes.

300
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Yeah,
selfish.

301
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,340
Yeah,
it's always going to be people like

302
00:12:58,341 --> 00:12:59,360
that.
Unfortunately.

303
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:04,361
And the thing about hunting is it so
controversial in a world where 95 to 97,

304
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,160
depending on who you asked,
percent of the people who eat meat,

305
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,300
it's still very controversial to go out
and kill yourself.

306
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,060
It's,

307
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,030
I still can't understand this weird,
um,

308
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,900
in addition to people being,
you know,

309
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,030
maybe moral or immoral or most are good
or bad.

310
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,690
Um,
this,

311
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,300
the contradiction of people not even
using their brains,

312
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
you know?
Um,

313
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,510
I,
I had the best Tacos I've ever had in my

314
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,140
life last week and it have to getting
waterboarded right?

315
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,053
Yep.
Yep.

316
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Maybe they tasted extra sweet,
but I had a bunch of friends over.

317
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:45,521
We had some wine from right,
right next door to where my parents,

318
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,650
like where I grew up and that the
animal,

319
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,390
the elk we're cooking meant.
I saw it for a day as I walked this

320
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,400
thing down.
I mean it most beautiful majestic

321
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,290
creature.
I'm like I said I was 600,

322
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,940
moved into unjust under three or right
at three.

323
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,140
And so I got to see it in life.
I got to see it at its death.

324
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:07,880
I got to see after death,
you know,

325
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,200
I have,
um,

326
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,330
I have the whole entire trophy.
I,

327
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:12,740
you know,
just just like you.

328
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,270
But I have two freezers,
a garnered six,

329
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:22,271
almost 600 cumulative pounds from the
hide the head and the meat for just shy

330
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:28,760
of 400 pounds of meat off that thing.
I still have two freezers full of meat,

331
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,440
you know,
it's a big animal.

332
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,720
It's a big end of delicious.
Good.

333
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,040
It's so good.
It's the best for you too.

334
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,350
It just feels different.
So good in your mouth.

335
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,350
It's the best for you and your mouth.
Yeah.

336
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,850
That's best for your body to.
I feel like it charges me up.

337
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,580
I want to fight velociraptors after,
as like,

338
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,450
oh,
I want to go to Columbia to where the

339
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:50,840
good stuff is.
Steal some of the good,

340
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,040
like the old

341
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Pablo Escobar style coke and then bring
that back to wherever I am.

342
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,630
And I think that's the equivalent of
what good elk tastes like in your mouth.

343
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,990
I've never done good coke or bad coke,
so I've never done any coke,

344
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:10,010
but judging from the amount of money
that Pablo Escobar made and the way that

345
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,350
people talked about it,
um,

346
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:14,180
and how rich means delays,
I think it's pretty good stuff.

347
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,350
Um,
so I'm just,

348
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,700
use is definitely a high demand.
Yeah.

349
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,210
So this is the contrast of the
contradiction would be like people who

350
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:24,980
are animal rights lovers.
It'd be like you just talked about this

351
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:28,910
majestic animal that you watched and you
admired and then you shot it and killed

352
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:29,720
it.
Yeah.

353
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,920
God is beautiful.
You can see that.

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,930
Yeah.
I still love it.

355
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,930
I love every single ounce of it.
I know and I,

356
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:37,940
I agree with you,
but for people that are,

357
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,550
you know,
maybe animal rights activists or many of

358
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:45,551
them have ever been to,
not that I'm dogging on the cattle

359
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,400
industry because I'm not a,
I think they try to do the best that

360
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:54,110
they can with what they have to produce
enough food to feed a huge ever growing

361
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,710
population.

362
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,000
I mean this is,
this is a hard thing.

363
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,250
Um,
you've been to one of those farms.

364
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,760
I have,
yeah.

365
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,510
Um,
I don't have the good ones and I've been

366
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,810
the bad ones.
Yeah.

367
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,940
I know how my,
my animal died and it died fast,

368
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,440
peacefully,
right?

369
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:12,680
Where it loved being.
And I'm never felt anything.

370
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,680
Never saw anything.
It just crumbled.

371
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,450
Yeah.
There's also the balance of life to

372
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,330
there.
There's just,

373
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,800
unless you want to bring wolves and
mountain lions into Texas and to

374
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,640
wherever,
you know,

375
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:26,930
you're hunting,
you tried that,

376
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,980
that's not working.
It's not working.

377
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,530
No.
They brought the wolves and now they're

378
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,190
looking to hundreds like me to come into
balance the wolves because the wolves

379
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,350
are decimating the herds a to,
to a degree that they've never seen

380
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:40,184
ever.
Because there's,

381
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,060
there's no balance,
there's nothing to balance the wolves.

382
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,670
So what was the amount of available food
resources.

383
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,190
Now the wolves are just killing
everything.

384
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,860
So even yellowstone and they're like,
um,

385
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,810
can,
can we bring in some pro hunters to try

386
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:56,570
and balance this?
They docked on the herd in yellowstone

387
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,390
by 90 percent at one point.
Ah,

388
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,550
90 percent this from the wolves they
brought in the nineties.

389
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:02,950
They're like,
okay,

390
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,520
well we lost the wolves from the sixties
to the eighties,

391
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:09,350
so let's bring back some wolves in the
nineties and think that we can balance

392
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:13,430
things and while it paid a positive
effect for about 10 years,

393
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,600
then 20 2010 rolls around.
They're like,

394
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,700
wait,
wait a second.

395
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,410
They're killing entire hurts.
Like we might lose all indigenous elk

396
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:27,440
here if we don't do something
immediately.

397
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,410
Um,
so now they're bringing in guys like me

398
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:34,700
to dark them and retry and relocate them
and bring whatever.

399
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,950
Well,
the whole idea behind it was so crazy.

400
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:40,250
They went and got these giant Canadian
gray wolves and brought them over here

401
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,440
in,
into a place where the animals had,

402
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,930
you know,
they had no knowledge of walls.

403
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,980
They had wiped out the wolf population
and the size of the wolf is bigger than

404
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,160
what was originally here.

405
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,560
So naturally the amount of calories
that,

406
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,810
that wolf needed was greater.
Um,

407
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,840
and with,
with a hundred years of lack of

408
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:03,450
evolution for the animals that were
there to know what to do.

409
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,670
Yeah,
it was just fish in a barrel for these

410
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:08,160
wolves that had adapting though they're
adapting,

411
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,020
adapting quick,
but they're still getting jacked.

412
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,270
The part of the problem is people say,
well,

413
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,700
it's there.
They're killing the weak animals,

414
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,850
but they're not the weak ones.
Go down into the farm lands you're

415
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:23,070
getting like the the cows and the
calves,

416
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,230
the smaller elk,
the female and the babies.

417
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,830
They're moving into farmlands and the
big males when they're not running,

418
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,060
they stay up in the mountains and they
use usually formed these like bachelor

419
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,390
records and when they're not running and
when this is happening,

420
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,020
that's where the wolves are.
So the wolves are killing me.

421
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,770
I have friends that live in Idaho and
friends that live in Montana and they're

422
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,710
like,
it's bad.

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,530
Like there,
there's a lot of fucking wolves killing

424
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,670
giant elk.

425
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,100
I've been failing in communicating what.
So right now we,

426
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,120
we agree with each other and we're.
We're almost echoing the same sediments.

427
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,120
So that person that doesn't agree with
us that,

428
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,550
that.
I'm Vegetarian Vegan,

429
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,890
I'm a conservationist that,
that looks at us.

430
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:06,181
She's like,
no,

431
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:06,991
no,
you guys are hunters.

432
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:10,140
You can't be conservationist.
Where does the conversation start?

433
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:15,141
Where's the middle ground where you can
find one where an opportunity to build

434
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,970
rapport and to have a conversation,
have a discussion,

435
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:22,971
to have maybe even a debate where you
can intellectually talk through your

436
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:28,850
different perspectives.
I've been failing at this miserably of

437
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,330
late and I've been getting a lot of it.
It's,

438
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,360
it's weird when my social media,
I think I have a lot of conservative

439
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,990
military,
you know,

440
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,620
pro second amendment types that follow
me when that whole entire base is mad at

441
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:44,510
me,
which is weird.

442
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,810
And then on the other side,
the far left progressive side is looking

443
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:51,290
at me and be like,
oh,

444
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,140
we hate you too.
So I'm like,

445
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,650
I have now pissed off 95 percent of
people on social media because I'm

446
00:19:57,651 --> 00:19:59,600
trying to find middle ground so we can
talk.

447
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,220
Have you pissed off the conservatives?
Have you done that?

448
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,400
Lance?
Lance Armstrong and I were talking about

449
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,430
gun control after the parklands shooting
in Florida and he asked me,

450
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,330
do you think gun control is a solution?
And I said,

451
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,760
absolutely.
I think gun control can be a massive

452
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,800
solution verbatim.
That's exactly what I said.

453
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,103
Now,
to me,

454
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,070
gun control,
those were words.

455
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,650
Words like,
well regulated militia.

456
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,500
The words in the constitution that the.
That's almost synonymous to me.

457
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,510
Gun Laws.
Also a form of gun control,

458
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:36,860
just like a well regulated militia.
I think that having good,

459
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,990
safe gun laws,
save lives.

460
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,410
Um,
I don't want to have a felon and Ms. 13

461
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:43,670
guy,
an illegal immigrant.

462
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:45,920
Somebody that's been dishonorably
discharged from the military to get

463
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,470
their hands on a gun.
We have laws.

464
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,840
Those are forms of gun control in my
opinion.

465
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,440
But the Conservatives Second Amendment,
if you use the words gun control,

466
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,870
uh,
like I,

467
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,740
I was immediately called Benedict
Arnold.

468
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm a trader.
I was uh,

469
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,140
a duff.
I don't even know what a duff is.

470
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,610
That was a reoccurring one.
I think it was the guy from.

471
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:10,900
I'm
Roger Rabbit,

472
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,180
the guy that would hunt around with the
gun,

473
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,670
but he didn't know how to use the gun
because he always missed Roger Rabbit.

474
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,660
Do you mean bugs bunny?
Yeah.

475
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,980
Yeah.
Bugs bunny step.

476
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,460
Elmer Fudd.
Yeah,

477
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,520
that's where they called fid,
so I all,

478
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,850
I mean hundreds of people and I wouldn't
just,

479
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,580
I'm trying to have a conversation with
Lance Armstrong,

480
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:35,290
a guy that had never shot a gun at the
time that was against private private

481
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,920
citizens,
really owning guns and he couldn't be

482
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:42,850
more for gun control,
but I wonder just to talk to him and so

483
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,310
I had no problem using his vernacular,
using,

484
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:46,840
you know,
the words that he's comfortable with,

485
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:50,020
like gun control even though to me
that's just gun laws,

486
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:50,800
that's well regulated.

487
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,310
Militia.
I mean I'm a huge second member

488
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,520
proponent.
I don't think anybody has ever

489
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,080
questioned that until this moment when,
if they just pay attention to you for

490
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,090
five minutes,
all they have dudes is go to your social

491
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,920
media and you know,
is not an anti gun guy.

492
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,170
No guys on the range.
How many days a week?

493
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,280
Six.
Five.

494
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,233
Come on.
Yeah,

495
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,990
like I'm mad that I'm here with you.
I'm not on the range,

496
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:13,000
you know,
but I said I'll make it up tomorrow.

497
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,800
Yeah,
you are,

498
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,300
you're a gun nut for sure.
For sure.

499
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,010
It's an occupational thing.
Yes.

500
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,390
Like I have no choice.
This is,

501
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:20,650
this is,
this is what I do know.

502
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,000
If you want to be excellent at your job,
you must be a good.

503
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

504
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,660
Uh,
well in that conversation I disavowed

505
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,350
apparently my huge group of Second
Amendment loving people.

506
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,510
I have a theory on that.
I think there's a lot of people that

507
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,590
just looking,
get pissed off and if you say any word

508
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,860
that they decide is a hot button word
like gun control,

509
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,780
they don't care if you've thought it out
and you have a rational perspective on

510
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:52,980
what you consider gun control.
Like there was a statement that was

511
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:57,981
released by a group of hunters,
hunters for gun control and they had a

512
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:03,801
bunch of reasonable reasons why people
shouldn't have a firearm that could get

513
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:07,140
a firearm currently.
And it all made sense,

514
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,320
but the,
the response to that,

515
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:13,380
the backlash of it isn't.
It's not debate.

516
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:16,770
It's like people on that side,
the pro second amendment side,

517
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,870
they're so terrified of any new
regulation and they think that you have

518
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:26,550
to hold your ground because any slipping
backwards is going to eventually lead to

519
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:27,660
someone taking your guns away.

520
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,420
I mean,
I,

521
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,930
I do understand the death by a thousand
cuts,

522
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,700
you know,
I,

523
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,590
I think that has always been the
perspective,

524
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,680
you know,
if you look at,

525
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,980
it's not like Adolf Hitler said,
okay,

526
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,140
we're going to kill all the blacks and
all the Jews overnight.

527
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,530
That's not what happened,
right?

528
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,620
It was,
it was over the course of seven,

529
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:46,130
eight years where he just very
incrementally

530
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,330
change laws.
Okay.

531
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,710
They're not allowed to shop here.
Okay.

532
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:49,910
They're not allowed to go here.
Okay.

533
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,790
Now we're gonna move them all into the
same area and very slowly,

534
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,980
not slowly.
And in a matter of five,

535
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:55,940
six,
seven years,

536
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,750
he started a genocide of an entire
ethnicity.

537
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,120
Um,
and that's that fear.

538
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,140
It's okay.
It's gonna be,

539
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,870
it's gonna be incremental and we're.
And at some point we're going to turn

540
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,180
around and look and be like,
look at all of this freedom that we've

541
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,600
lost.
I think it's the same with during,

542
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,460
right after nine slash 11 when George
Bush,

543
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:14,751
you know,
the,

544
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,100
the Freedom Act,
uh,

545
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,720
or the Patriot Act,
the Patriot Act,

546
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,500
you know,
like that was one of the largest losses

547
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:25,790
of privacy that Americans have ever,
ever experienced.

548
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,940
But we were fearful,
we were scared and you know,

549
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:30,350
like,
I love dangerous freedom,

550
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,390
but overnight we lost a ton of that.

551
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,500
I'm not incrementally just overnight
and,

552
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,390
and,
but the most efficient way is to take it

553
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,670
bit by bit by bit.
So I get that.

554
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,790
Um,
but for Christ sakes,

555
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,420
man,
I'm like,

556
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,270
you can't find somebody that's more of a
proponent of the second one than me,

557
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,790
except apparently on that day when I
pissed off.

558
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,130
So I'm trying to figure out how to have
a conversation.

559
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:54,680
I can't do it.
I don't think that there are any more of

560
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:56,810
a second amendment proponents than you
are.

561
00:24:56,811 --> 00:25:01,370
I just think they're ideologically so
rigid in this idea that you can't change

562
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:03,720
gun laws at all.
And if you think that someone who's on

563
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,540
anti psychotic medication and when I was
bouts of schizophrenia,

564
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,520
you think that person should be allowed
to have guns.

565
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,620
When they hear voices that aren't real,
they,

566
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,510
they,
they see things that aren't really there

567
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,520
had been reported to the FBI a handful
of times.

568
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,650
The sheriff knows about them.
The,

569
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,730
the principal knows about them.
The pro.

570
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,900
Well obviously the problem with that is
someone can decide to report Tim

571
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,090
Kennedy,
they can make up some story.

572
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,710
Tim Kennedy's been acting crazy.
Tim Kennedy's doing these.

573
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,780
Sandy's going to kill my family.
Tim Kennedy's doing this.

574
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,080
Tim Kennedy.
If someone just decides to actively

575
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:37,220
target you in that way,
they can sort of frame you as some sort

576
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:41,030
of a crazy person and then use that as
an excuse to go after guns.

577
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:44,360
I mean this is what people are terrified
of and that is possible.

578
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,290
It is been an objective and there's no
due process on the back side.

579
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,380
Okay.
So if somebody was wrongfully put on a

580
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:54,200
list or you would not be allowed to buy
a gun,

581
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,760
how do you get off that list?
Right.

582
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,060
How do you,
I don't know,

583
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,921
doing it.
I mean,

584
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:00,080
as I said,
guy that spends quite a bit of time.

585
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,710
You know what I think hopefully
protecting gun laws and protecting gun

586
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:05,750
ownership.
I don't even know how to get off that

587
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:06,890
list.
No,

588
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,020
that's scary.
Probably don't ever get off.

589
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,510
It's like the no fly list.
There's just not a way to not get off

590
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:13,070
it.
It was the fuck ever gets back on the

591
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,040
flight and I know you were off the list,
but you're back on.

592
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,500
Come on back southwest.
No worries.

593
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,820
Sitting near the window.
No.

594
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,550
Can I?
My beverage service and peanut please.

595
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,940
Yeah.
It's things where there's a left side

596
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:27,980
and a right side.
If you say something that the left

597
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:30,590
believes in,
you're a trader and if you see if you're

598
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,780
on the other side of say something,
the right beliefs and you're a trader.

599
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:34,190
No,
the conversation has to happen in the

600
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:34,821
middle.
Right?

601
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:36,530
Does that how?
How,

602
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,480
how?
How do you live?

603
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,560
Conversation with animals has to happen
in the middle.

604
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:41,630
When you talk you about the consumption
of animals.

605
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:45,000
You have the hardcore animal rights
activists who don't want anything to

606
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,220
die,
but how do they feel about wolves eating

607
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,500
elk asshole first?
Tear him apart.

608
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,700
Many of you.
Okay with that.

609
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,650
I mean,
are you okay with natural probation?

610
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,590
You are just not okay with humans
predating.

611
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,510
So how do you want to balance out the
population of say,

612
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,390
wild pigs?
Like what do you.

613
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,640
What's your proposal?
They don't have one.

614
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,060
You mean there's not enough resources in
the world to go out and trap them and if

615
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:07,470
you did trap them when you can do it,
give them.

616
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,610
You got to fix them.
You're going to give him vasectomies.

617
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,770
So we tried to give him to the homeless
but the homeless were eating them in

618
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:15,090
Texas.
Really?

619
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,040
Why would you not eat wild pig?

620
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,650
I don't.
Delicious Texas wild pigs.

621
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:20,730
Pretty.
Is it funky?

622
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,600
It's pretty funky.
Really isn't how you just.

623
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,350
How you take care of it?
Well you have to take care of it.

624
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:28,080
That's the thing is as these are swamp
living.

625
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,071
Oh right,
right,

626
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,000
right.
Rough.

627
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,690
Pretty nasty things.
So there was a period of time where we

628
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,810
could go and during the eradication
we're trying to curb the ever growing

629
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,180
population.
Um,

630
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,370
if you shot x number,
you could bring maybe a fat Sao in and

631
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,830
to the food shelter and they'd have a
butcher and then they tried to serve it

632
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,670
and they're like,
eh,

633
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:51,150
nobody was eating it.
So then we tried that for about six

634
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:52,620
months and then they said,
forget it.

635
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:54,900
We're just wasting money.
Trying to is just so goofy,

636
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,650
goofy world we live in where people who
are starving or picky,

637
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,690
picky.
I don't want that wild pig.

638
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,120
Well maybe,
I mean in their defense maybe he's just

639
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:06,690
really poorly handled and by the time
they get it it's tainted.

640
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,680
It smells bad and no,
no.

641
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,820
I mean it's entirely possible that
somebody fucked it up along the way.

642
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,220
They don't treat wild pigs in Texas.
Like you would treat like a deer that

643
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,900
you shot,
that you hunted down,

644
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,790
took a long time to track and you had
to,

645
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,740
you know,
get into perfect position and you

646
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:25,230
cherish that meat.
Wild pigs are shooting them out of

647
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:26,080
helicopters.
I mean,

648
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,480
you,
I'm sure you've seen those Ted nugent

649
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:28,230
videos.
Oh yeah,

650
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,760
I do it if you do that.
I do.

651
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,680
Hello hunting.
Yeah,

652
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,140
there'll be farmed.
So a farm in,

653
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,140
let's say central Texas,
north of Austin,

654
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:41,700
south of Dallas,
they're losing 10 to 15 percent of their

655
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:44,880
agriculture every single year to wild
pigs and millions of dollars.

656
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,280
So if you have a $10,000,000 ranch,
you're losing one and a half million

657
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,660
dollars to wild pigs.

658
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,540
Wild pigs.
Yeah.

659
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,730
And there's not a lot of profit in,
in,

660
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,790
in being a farmer.
So one and a half million dollars is a

661
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,090
lot of money to these guys and not.
On the flip side,

662
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,230
you have a bunch of.
I'm using hunters,

663
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,290
guys that are coming to because it's
sport fun.

664
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,380
I mean there's not,
there's not much fair game here.

665
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:15,810
There's not stocking these animals.
It's thermals,

666
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:20,070
it's white lights off jeeps.
It's any way you can imagine to try to

667
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:24,240
kill these things and we're not even
making a dent in how fast these things

668
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:25,340
are breeding.
Yeah.

669
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,211
You know,
they,

670
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:30,330
the,
the sow can have at the age of one.

671
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,790
It could start having three or four
litters a year.

672
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,250
We get six months.
Oh,

673
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,240
it's crazy.
I think they can start breeding at six

674
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:40,410
months and they're having multiple
litters a year and each litter can have

675
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,770
six to pigs.

676
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,750
Yeah,
we're done.

677
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,540
If there's zombies where it's over,
it's over.

678
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,890
Well,
if they were predators,

679
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,300
I mean,
imagine if these things were like wolves

680
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,940
spread like that.
Oh,

681
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,120
I bet you have.
Yeah.

682
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,760
You'll know how tim goes to sleep at
night.

683
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,960
You just nailed it,
Joe.

684
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,260
You got it.
I mean,

685
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:58,960
could you imagine if wolves were doing
that?

686
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,540
If there were that many wolves and they
were just roaming through the

687
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:04,150
countryside packs of a thousand dollars
of erection now.

688
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,220
Whew.
Yup.

689
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,930
Curb it.
Pull it back,

690
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,910
pull back.
Use your mind.

691
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,160
Okay.
Yeah.

692
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,490
I mean that,
that conversation is the conversation

693
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,650
where the vegans run into an ideological
wall,

694
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,210
like what do you would you say about
that?

695
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,730
You want to just let live and let be.
Well,

696
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:21,160
you're not going to have any vegan food
because they eat vegan food.

697
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,780
Okay.
You're not gonna have any food.

698
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,120
The pigs are gonna.
Eat All your food unless you're growing

699
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:26,620
your own food,
and then what are you going to do with

700
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,860
the pigs?
Break your fences and eat your food.

701
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,790
You don't have any food left or they
break your fences.

702
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,410
They do break your.
Break your everything.

703
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,020
They,
they are big and they're powerful

704
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:38,230
creatures and they decimate ground
nesting birds.

705
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,190
Anything that's small.
I mean there's,

706
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:42,340
there's some videos that we have from
Texas.

707
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,370
Have A,
a big boar running away with an access

708
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,530
to your font and it's mouth.
I mean,

709
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,290
they eat everything they can.
It's their,

710
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,290
they're monsters and they're delicious.
Filling or know about Texas ones.

711
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,520
I'll never had eight,
eight.

712
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,670
I've eaten a couple of California ones.
They were fantastic.

713
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,470
Yep.
My Dad,

714
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,450
you know,
he's in Monterey County.

715
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,523
He,
uh,

716
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,530
he has his pig trough pig pond and he
has a herd of pigs that come every

717
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:08,740
night.

718
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,930
And the,
I mean,

719
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,110
it's almost like a visceral response for
me to watch my dad drive down in his

720
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:16,450
four wheeler and feed these things where
I'm like,

721
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,400
oh no god,
why does he feed him?

722
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,520
Because he loves them.
He elk come through there,

723
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:23,410
you know,
like he has truly lt got wonder since

724
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,390
his property and so he has a bunch of
these wild pigs and so he and his,

725
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,830
my mom,
they sit on the porch and they watched

726
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,180
the wild animals and deer and it's kind
of cool,

727
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,280
super cool.
But then like the texting and he's like,

728
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:38,920
I don't want to just get rid of all of
those things.

729
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,280
They're bombing nation.
Missouri has an interesting take on it.

730
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,460
They're,
they're making hunting them illegal and

731
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:48,280
the reason why they're making hunting
them illegal is because people are

732
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:52,210
bringing them into areas and releasing
them in public land so that they can

733
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,490
hunt these wild pigs and the recognizing
this.

734
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:58,660
So what they've done to,
to curb the desire for people to do that

735
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,800
is,
first of all,

736
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:04,750
they're trapping them instead of running
down down with dogs or shooting them and

737
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:05,840
they find by trapping.
Um,

738
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,050
there's a great podcast that Steve
Rinella,

739
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,480
he has the mediator podcast.
It's a great podcast,

740
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:15,481
but he had a guy who is a wild pick,
wild pig eradication expert from

741
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:18,760
Missouri.
He works for the Department of fish and

742
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:21,100
wildlife down there and uh,
or a,

743
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,320
I guess they call it fishing game down
there for California,

744
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:26,130
they call it fish and wildlife,
but they're,

745
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:27,730
um,
they've used these traps.

746
00:32:27,731 --> 00:32:30,100
They,
they can get as many as 63 pigs at a

747
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:34,030
time and he's like,
if we tried to shoot 63 pigs,

748
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:37,480
it would take forever to do that.
So they're using these large scale

749
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:40,130
traps,
catching these and

750
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,960
you know,
they're just killing them and the way

751
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,820
they're doing their,
they're like,

752
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,920
get a lot of backlash from hunters
because the hunters like,

753
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,510
well,
why don't you just let us hunt them to

754
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:50,000
say no,
we want to get rid of all of them.

755
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,420
These are a dangerous invasive species.
You guys want to keep something around

756
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:55,160
for fun,
but you're not going to manage the

757
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:56,810
population correctly.
You really can't.

758
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,790
Yeah.
So they're just,

759
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,170
they're on an eradication bend down
there.

760
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,690
Yeah,
I'd love to see how that works.

761
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,410
They're apparently doing a really good
job in keeping them from spreading into

762
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:09,650
new areas of public land.
Like they'll get a notification,

763
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,610
someone will say,
hey,

764
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:15,230
we saw sow and two baby piglets in this
one area,

765
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:18,710
and they will just go there immediately
and just track those things down and try

766
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:21,380
to kill him.
The areas where populations are clearly

767
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,300
established that trying to get them from
spreading.

768
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,760
Yeah,
I mean it's,

769
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,500
it's huge industry too though.
Yeah.

770
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,370
Um,
I mean hunting in general,

771
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,780
we're talking billions and billions of
dollars and you know,

772
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:34,290
whether your trophy hunting in in Africa
and your,

773
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:37,860
your pain,
a few hundred thousand dollars for water

774
00:33:37,861 --> 00:33:40,200
buffalo or you know,
you're going in,

775
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,460
you know,
just getting some

776
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,030
blessed balk or an impala and you're
still paying $10,000.

777
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,570
The flight,
the donating the food to the village,

778
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,040
the trophy,
the trophy fee,

779
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,870
the processing,
then the shipping.

780
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,680
And we're the gun itself,
the ammo pain for the Pah,

781
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:00,380
pain for the guide,
pain for the tracker,

782
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,280
that that's all real real money.
And then on even on the local American

783
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,140
side,
deer hunting,

784
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,210
elk hunting,
pig hunting,

785
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,840
still billion dollar industry.
And uh,

786
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,620
that money directly goes back to habitat
protection conservation.

787
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:21,920
Not,
not,

788
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,780
not,
not in like incremental percentages,

789
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,980
massive portions of that money.
Yeah.

790
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:26,650
It's a Sigmund

791
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,780
Robert's act,
right?

792
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:28,710
It's like,
what is it?

793
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:31,350
Eleven percent Jamie.
See if you could find that they,

794
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,050
I think they established that in the
thirties and this was uh,

795
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,120
in response to,
you know,

796
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:41,150
what Teddy Roosevelt did when they were
trying to keep large swaths of public

797
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:46,900
land available for people to recreate on
and then try to bring back populations

798
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:51,060
of these animals that needed funds to do
that because market hunting,

799
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:54,660
people think it was like just hunters
have decimated the population sort of,

800
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,990
but market hunting,
it was hunting wild animals for people

801
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,250
to eat,
which is now illegal.

802
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,910
You can't just go shoot a bunch of deer
and then sell it to people.

803
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:04,830
It's illegal and one of the reasons why
it's illegals,

804
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:07,680
they wanted to stop market hunting.
So they take all this money,

805
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:10,470
which I believe is 11 percent.
Is it 11 percent?

806
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,410
Eleven percent of all the money from
hunting supplies,

807
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,610
gear,
guns,

808
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:15,360
all that shit.

809
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,190
All of it goes towards conservation.
That turns out to be billions and

810
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,023
billions of dollars a year.
Yeah,

811
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,850
and that's.
That's what keeps the protection.

812
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,460
Here it goes right here.
Okay.

813
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:28,590
The ninth,
early 19 hundreds marine wildlife

814
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:32,490
species are disappearing or declining.
The firearms and ammunition industry

815
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,120
asked Congress to impose an excise tax.
I mean,

816
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:39,060
that is amazing.
They asked to impose this tax on the

817
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:42,630
sale of firearms and ammunition to help
fund wildlife conservation in the United

818
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,470
States.
The Pittman Robertson Act passed in 1937

819
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,410
known as the federal aid and wildlife
restoration.

820
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:53,820
So this is.
This is how wetlands get preserved.

821
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:58,440
Wildlife Habitat.
I'm like a traveling corridors for mule

822
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:00,120
deer.
How they keep them from getting

823
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:02,520
developed.
All that stuff is through conservation

824
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:04,830
money that comes from hunting.
The difference between the amount of

825
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:09,030
money that comes from hunting and
conservation acts that gets donated to

826
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:13,140
preserve wildlife versus animal rights
groups is so stunning.

827
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,910
You can't even count.
I mean,

828
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,520
there's like not even pennies on the
dollar,

829
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,480
nothing.
It's like they don't donate.

830
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,670
I mean,
some people donate a few dollars here or

831
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:21,950
there to things,
but the,

832
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,290
the vast majority of the money comes
from hunters,

833
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,910
which creates this really confusing
place for a lot of people.

834
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,440
That's the middle ground killing
animals.

835
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,330
That's,
that's ended up being like the middle

836
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:37,350
ground conversation that nobody will
actually have the conversation about

837
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:39,600
Africa to right.
That those animals,

838
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,900
when you let people hunt them,
they're worth a lot more than if you

839
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,770
just let the poachers come in and
protect them.

840
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,630
But the moment that the hunters go away,
they disappear.

841
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,840
But the animal rights activists and the
vegans were like us to move past that

842
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,690
and get to the point where we don't kill
animals at all.

843
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,000
And if you eat animals,
you get it from a lab.

844
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,760
It's not impossible,
but it's go to Africa,

845
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,290
it's fucking hot in Africa.
It's probably impossible unless some

846
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,000
massive evolution happens with
consciousness and people just stop being

847
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:09,610
people.

848
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,530
Yeah.
So Limpopo,

849
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:14,710
which is north of South Africa,
right on the Botswana border,

850
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,770
um,
they kinda like gave this world of

851
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:22,000
trying to 90 percent of the exact right
location,

852
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,770
but they,
they,

853
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:27,770
they outlawed the hunting of some
specific wild game and the farmers that

854
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:31,720
have had them just kind of,
okay,

855
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:33,700
we're just gonna we're just going to let
them go because you're not worth

856
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:38,380
anything to us.
All of their animals disappeared in a

857
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,310
year.
Poached.

858
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,840
That's crazy.
In a year.

859
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,750
One year all of them were gone,
just disappeared.

860
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,250
Um,
so the intent was,

861
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:46,120
okay,
these,

862
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:50,620
these are nearing endangered,
so we're gonna allow people to Hump

863
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:51,520
them.
Uh,

864
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:56,110
and then they went from endangered to
almost endangered to absolutely

865
00:37:56,111 --> 00:38:00,550
endangered the critically because nobody
was protecting them because there are no

866
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:02,080
hunters.
That one too did

867
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:02,923
them.
Yeah.

868
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,080
It's,
it's hard for people to wrap their head

869
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:08,230
around because it's so messy.
It's not a clean issue.

870
00:38:08,231 --> 00:38:11,350
It's so messy.
And you see some fat slob holding his

871
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:16,351
rifle over a lion and you go,
there's no way in nature this fat fuck

872
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,570
should be able to shoot that lion and
just,

873
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:21,010
you know,
and mounted on his wall.

874
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:23,110
There's a photo that I got off the
Internet of a guy.

875
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:27,220
He looks like he's about 500 pounds,
let me just overflowing with gluttony

876
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,470
just.
And he's got a rifle and there's a

877
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:30,640
deadline there.
And I'm like,

878
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,980
okay,
does every,

879
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,930
this is everything that's wrong with
hunting because he's not going to eat

880
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,000
that lion.
Like why did he go over there to shoot

881
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:38,530
that line?
It's one thing if that line was like

882
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,660
hunting,
his family are interfering with his

883
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,190
cattle business and no,
no,

884
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:42,550
no.

885
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,330
That guy flew over there.
He wattled over to the bike,

886
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,540
the bog pod,
rest of the rifle down and pulled the

887
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:53,140
trigger on one of the biggest apex
predators on the planet.

888
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,790
Everybody should have a problem with
that.

889
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,800
It's fucking weird.
It's weird.

890
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,520
But now here's the contradiction.
If those animals aren't worth money for

891
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:03,310
people to hunt,
then what happens is they will happens

892
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:06,310
in Zimbabwe.
They just kill hundreds of them because

893
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,930
they're,
there's too many of them now because

894
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,000
people aren't hunting them,
so they're decimating the Angelo

895
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,490
population,
so they have to curb the lions.

896
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,870
So instead of getting $50,000 or
$100,000 a lion from a hunter,

897
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,170
which goes to the villagers,
goes to conservation NGOs to hire

898
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:22,930
professional hunters.
Now they get nothing and they have to

899
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,150
pay someone to go and shoot these lines
and they should,

900
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:26,800
all of them should all have issued all
of them.

901
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,903
And you're like,
well,

902
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,160
this sucks.
This is not good.

903
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,050
None of this shit.
This ain't good both ways.

904
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:34,390
Not good to lose that fat guy standing
over a line.

905
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,460
And it's not good to look at these,
you know,

906
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,940
these government people shooting 200
lions and just dumping them into a hole

907
00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:41,710
somewhere.
The whole thing's a mess.

908
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,190
That's Africa.
Here we try to do the right thing.

909
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,080
Um,
or you know,

910
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,510
if you're going to get a,
if you're gonna,

911
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:54,530
get a bear tag from Colorado or are you
going to bear tag from New Mexico for

912
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:57,560
that tag to be issued?
They measured the amount of food that's

913
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,910
in each district and then you're,
they're going to issue six tags because

914
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:05,180
there's enough food to.
There's 12 bears there,

915
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:07,820
but there's only enough food to feel to
feed six of them,

916
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,380
so they're going to issue six tags that
or all 12 of them might starve to death

917
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,890
or the majority of them,
so they're going to issue and you can go

918
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:18,890
and buy your six tags.
That leaves six animals in that,

919
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,270
in that area,
in that region.

920
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:22,520
They are able to hunt your pain for that
tech.

921
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:24,140
A lot of money.
Sometimes if you're out of state,

922
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:25,550
you know you're paying a few hundred
dollars,

923
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:25,941
five,
six,

924
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:28,820
$700,
flights,

925
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:31,670
hotels.
It's for a bear and it adds up.

926
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:32,300
It adds up

927
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,340
is up,
but you know,

928
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,180
understand the mindset of people that
don't want any of this to happen.

929
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:41,030
I do understand that,
but I do think that they don't

930
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:44,180
understand nature.
I really don't think they understand

931
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,140
that this is the best death these
animals will ever experience and they're

932
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:50,300
not going to live forever in the wild
and the wild.

933
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:52,490
They're going to be torn apart by
something bigger than that.

934
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,980
That's just how it goes 100 percent of
the time.

935
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,410
Or they freeze to death or they starve
to death

936
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,270
or they're starving.
They walked out onto the road and try to

937
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,960
find some food in the town they get hit
by a semi truck.

938
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,230
Yeah,
that sounds good.

939
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,460
Yeah.
And if I have a buddy who lives in Iowa

940
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,200
and when you drive in his neighborhood
at night,

941
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:10,590
you'd better go 35 miles an hour because
those fuckers just darting out in front

942
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:11,610
of the street,
left and right.

943
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:13,890
They're everywhere.
And you know,

944
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,210
what's the,
what's the solution?

945
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:17,370
Don't drive cars.
Drive your bike everywhere man.

946
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,653
Well,
okay,

947
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,090
good luck with that.
Yeah,

948
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,290
I get it.
I get where those people are coming

949
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,520
from.
They're coming from a place of

950
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,960
compassion,
but it becomes very culty and it becomes

951
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:30,300
very,
very team oriented.

952
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,860
Their team Vegan and

953
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,290
there's like words were circling back
were,

954
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,100
you know,
when you're trying to have that middle

955
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:38,810
ground,
that discussion,

956
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:40,430
that conversation.
Um,

957
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,690
there's like this pre assigned talking
points.

958
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,540
Yeah.
Where everybody from every respect of

959
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:51,020
side mixed essentially the same
arguments and you're just regurgitating

960
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:55,610
what you've heard other people say,
but there's no new thoughts is new and

961
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,580
there's no one taking a step to either
side like,

962
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,290
okay,
do you want maybe maybe there's

963
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,750
something I'm not seeing here.
Let me look at it from this perspective

964
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,760
or vice versa.
Where this side,

965
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:05,571
the hunters like,
no,

966
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:07,490
no you,
you stupid snowflake,

967
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,520
you know,
go get your starbucks latte with soy

968
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:13,940
milk and.
But they're never looking at it from

969
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:17,000
anything new right there.
They're just regurgitating their talking

970
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,220
points.
Like when you said gun control and

971
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:21,890
people freaked out,
freaked out because I didn't stay to the

972
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,630
script and there's a script.

973
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,560
I mean if you,
if you pull up my,

974
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,200
my,
any of my social,

975
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,500
you will see that.
Oh you what you should've said was or

976
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,513
hey,
you know,

977
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,560
shall not be infringed upon.
Yeah man,

978
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
I got it.
Yeah.

979
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,710
Shall not be infringed upon and believe
it to death.

980
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,480
Have you fought for it?
Have you bled for it?

981
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,770
You've been blown up for it.
You can try it.

982
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,990
I have,
you know,

983
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I really believe in this shit but I
didn't stay to the script and then I get

984
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,070
murdered by both sides.
So then what,

985
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,170
how do we,
I mean,

986
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:53,450
you do a pretty good job,
so teach me Joe,

987
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,910
how do you bring people in to have

988
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,360
a talk?
There's got to be a lot of people that

989
00:42:58,361 --> 00:43:01,150
disagree with you and say I do a
terrible job that I repeat the same

990
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:02,890
things over and over again and I agree
with them too,

991
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,150
for for a certain amount of the
conversations like this one.

992
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,920
I mean we,
I've had this conversation about

993
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,230
conservation and animals a hundred
times,

994
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,110
but I think it's worth having 100 more
because I think it's an important that

995
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:16,510
if someone is listening to this podcast
and they didn't understand how it all

996
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:20,380
works and they didn't understand that
people who hunt and eat meat,

997
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:22,840
they're not monsters.
They're not evil people,

998
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,400
just like people who eat grain aren't
monsters because you counselee disregard

999
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:30,940
the lives of mice and rats,
all the things they get ground up and

1000
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,210
combines and bunnies like if you buy
grain,

1001
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,810
large scale agriculture is bad,
period.

1002
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,590
It's bad in terms of factory farming,
but it's also bad in terms of growing

1003
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:45,460
food.
If you grow a thousand acres of corn,

1004
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:49,750
you are absolutely displacing wildlife
and when that stuff gets harvest,

1005
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,110
you see vultures fly over those fields
and there's a reason.

1006
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,940
It's because there's a bunch of dead
things.

1007
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,240
In fact,
more dead lives,

1008
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,780
more dead lives occur in a pound of
grain than occur in a pound of beef

1009
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,380
because if you think that a cow is more
valuable than a bunny because it's

1010
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:15,670
larger,
like you've got some weird thing going

1011
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:16,660
on in your own head.

1012
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,790
Can you tell me how to balance the soles
worth on box

1013
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,810
and how'd you feel about insects?
Because they are a large scale poisoning

1014
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:28,560
those fucking insects and you know it.
Everybody knows and they're grinding

1015
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:31,950
those fuckers up with earth worms and
mice

1016
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,850
and gophers and chipmunks and anything
else that gets stuck in those wheels.

1017
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,030
That is just how large scale agriculture
works,

1018
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,830
so unless you have some isolated farm
where everything is fenced in and you

1019
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:44,480
only have,
you know,

1020
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,940
a certain amount of acreage and that
farm feeds you will you are Karma free

1021
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,850
and congratulations to you.
You figured out how to do it.

1022
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,790
But most of us who buy pasta,
if you go and buy bread in the store,

1023
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:59,791
you're paying someone who's killed a
large amount of living things in order

1024
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:02,670
to harvest that grain.
That's just a fact.

1025
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,260
It's just a fact and it's an
inconvenient fact that they like to look

1026
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:10,680
at with blinders on because they,
you know,

1027
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:15,030
like Hashtag cruelty free not to that
fucking bunny rabbit that's a part of

1028
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:18,420
your tofu because this is,
this is what's really going on.

1029
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:22,170
I mean,
a good part of the b vitamin B that a

1030
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:26,760
lot of vegans get is from ground up bugs
that's ground up into their grain and

1031
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:28,830
ground up into their vegetables.
I mean,

1032
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:30,780
this is you,
this is just,

1033
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,620
you can't get away around that.
No,

1034
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,640
I mean if you are being real,
if you're not,

1035
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,850
if you're being real.
Yeah,

1036
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,690
and that maybe that's the problem in the
first place is nobody is going to have

1037
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:46,660
the courage to come into that middle
ground and let,

1038
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,380
let go of all of their baggage and all
of their

1039
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,940
bullshit and just cool with eating bugs.
You should eat crickets.

1040
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:58,100
Get cricket meal,
eat cricket proteins.

1041
00:45:58,101 --> 00:46:00,610
Fucking good for you.
If you don't want to eat animals,

1042
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,420
you're like,
I'm just not into anything that's warm.

1043
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,750
Okay.
I have a friend who only eats fish and I

1044
00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:06,440
go,
why?

1045
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,940
He goes,
fish don't even take care of their

1046
00:46:07,941 --> 00:46:09,090
babies.
I was like,

1047
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,350
Ooh.
Good point.

1048
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,390
That is a good point.
Fuck those fish fishery.

1049
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,650
Yummy too.
He's like,

1050
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:15,240
I don't want to kill a mammal.
He goes,

1051
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:16,370
I don't want to eat a mammo.
He's like,

1052
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,340
mammals take care of their babies.
The babies milk from there.

1053
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,700
There are others.
I'm like,

1054
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:21,660
okay,
I get it.

1055
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:24,740
My wife has a pescatarian for awhile.
Um,

1056
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,540
that didn't,
that didn't last.

1057
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,080
It's just not the best source source of
nutrients.

1058
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,360
Well,
it was when she's pregnant and the

1059
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:33,870
doctor's like,
alright,

1060
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:38,970
so you're 90 pounds and uh,
I need you to put on like 20 more pounds

1061
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,300
really fast and you're not going to do
it.

1062
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,480
Eating halibut.
Yeah.

1063
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,190
So her iron was low.

1064
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,690
Yeah.
Iron b12.

1065
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,630
I mean all the fat soluble vitamins that
are very difficult to get some grants.

1066
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,820
They're very good.
Yeah.

1067
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,800
Yeah.
It's a company called.

1068
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:56,860
Well,
they changed their name.

1069
00:46:56,861 --> 00:46:59,380
They used to be called off with the Ergo
depot,

1070
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,500
another called fully and this is called
the Pisco.

1071
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:05,800
It's the best ergonomic chair.
I fucking love these things.

1072
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,740
I sit in these things hours a day.
My back

1073
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,210
bothers me.
I,

1074
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,930
I really can't sit for very long periods
of time on my desk at home.

1075
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,350
My reloading station.
It's all standing height or one of those

1076
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:18,530
standing desk guys.
Yup.

1077
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,150
I'll even take a medicine ball,
like the balance balls and um,

1078
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,120
I'll get on my knees on it and I'll just
balance.

1079
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:25,990
Oh,
that's a good move.

1080
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,020
Yeah.
It feels good and it's good.

1081
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:32,070
But his type type of your core strong,
it's less of the core and it's more um,

1082
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,160
I like a seven year old brain,
you know,

1083
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,600
that if,
if I'm,

1084
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,520
I'm not doing a lot of things at once,
I just get distracted so I just do lots

1085
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:45,250
of things at once,
like having to balance on a ball so I

1086
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:48,100
don't smash my face into the desk and
knock myself out while I'm reloading

1087
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:50,590
ammunition.
And playing with explosives like that is

1088
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:54,070
a perfect recipe for me to be successful
at reloading bullets.

1089
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,870
You reload explosive as well as bullets?
No,

1090
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,250
no.
So.

1091
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,110
Oh well I'm gunpowder isn't explosive.
Right?

1092
00:47:59,111 --> 00:47:59,690
Right,
right.

1093
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,150
I thought you meant like grenades and
shit to.

1094
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,060
No,
I will take a,

1095
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,960
like if we are going to go do so
tomorrow I'm playing with the Dutch

1096
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:10,570
special forces at roughly peak ranch in
Austin,

1097
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:15,571
Texas and we are going to set up a bunch
of booby traps for them when they come

1098
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:20,410
in to do their,
like their final culmination hit the

1099
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:23,410
full mission profile.
So they're going to spend all day

1100
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,480
planning and they're going to figure out
how they're going to walk through the

1101
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:28,330
woods and not get caught and I'm
essentially the terrorists that they're

1102
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:31,980
going to try and come kill 'em.
But I'm a really good terrorist.

1103
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,530
So how do you guys keep from actually
killing each other when you're doing

1104
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:36,364
this?
Oh,

1105
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,490
they're using,
um,

1106
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,373
simunitions.

1107
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,650
So they're there.
They use a real guns with different

1108
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:45,860
bolts that shoot paintballs
yeah.

1109
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,120
And then the feet per second of these
paint balls flying.

1110
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,770
800.
Okay.

1111
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,040
It still stings like a motherfucker.
I'm still wearing like hockey glasses,

1112
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,010
you know,
like the,

1113
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,930
our snowboard glasses ever catch one in
the mouth.

1114
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

1115
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,530
I have a friend that has like a tattoo
on his lip from the,

1116
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,780
from the paint.
Oh,

1117
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:05,530
wonderful.
Yeah.

1118
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,330
And it just went like,
it's all the way to the flesh,

1119
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:09,340
like it won't come out.
And he's like a chunk of pink and his

1120
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:11,740
lip for.
I offered to cut it out.

1121
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,930
He said no,
I don't know.

1122
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,310
Yeah,
I'm really good with a knife,

1123
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,550
so I bet you are.
Yeah.

1124
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,980
Dan,
if you're listening to right now,

1125
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,800
let me cut that out of your face.
It makes them unique.

1126
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,820
Is Unique.
What is finding Hitler all about?

1127
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,580
Um,
this is a show that you're on and it's

1128
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:31,990
on a one.
Is that what's on?

1129
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,400
Yeah.
Amy Is the parent network.

1130
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,420
It airs on history channel and we just
had our third season that just finished

1131
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:42,130
airing.
What's the thought process behind this

1132
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,640
is legit because a lot of people are
like finding Hitler.

1133
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:47,100
Get the fuck out of here.
They found Hitler.

1134
00:49:47,101 --> 00:49:48,520
He died.
Yeah.

1135
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:51,550
I mean not really.
We don't know that that's the,

1136
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:56,290
that's this isn't like ancient aliens.
This is whee they declassified a bunch

1137
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,090
of documents.
They,

1138
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,120
both the Israelis and the British and
the Germans and Americans in the past 20

1139
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:07,930
years have been consistently
declassified documents and there were a

1140
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:12,820
bunch of specifically FBI documents that
we were spending millions and millions

1141
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,570
of dollars actively searching for Hitler
after the war as was.

1142
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,730
Yeah,
like millions of dollars.

1143
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:19,950
Like hoover was like,
no,

1144
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:20,120
no,
no,

1145
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,170
no.
Send more FBI agents to South America

1146
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,100
and to North Africa.
Go to the canary,

1147
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,400
go to Spain,
trying to find out where this guy went,

1148
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,350
tons of real FBI documents with real
leads,

1149
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:41,351
with real informance some hand or some
first I accounts saying that they

1150
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:43,910
physically.
So anyways,

1151
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,790
that's the show is us trying to find
out,

1152
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:51,791
sift through reality.
And I'm the fiction of the,

1153
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,530
the allure,
the mist,

1154
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,390
the mystery of that asshole.

1155
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,270
So what's the official story?
The official story is that he killed

1156
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:03,350
himself right now.
Killed themself in the bunker with David

1157
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,040
Braun.
Yep.

1158
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,910
And is there any photographic evidence
of his death or anything?

1159
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,730
So what?
The Russians got the body and they got

1160
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:12,950
his school.
Um,

1161
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,970
and when they brought it back to Moscow,
nobody has ever been able to

1162
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:23,130
independently verify who and what this
body is.

1163
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:28,490
They let one genetic tests occur and the
body with the bullet holes that they

1164
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:32,010
said was Hitler and have said.
And that's the narrative.

1165
00:51:32,011 --> 00:51:32,910
That's a story.
That's the,

1166
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:37,650
all the eyewitness accounts that are in
even in the vicinity of collaborating

1167
00:51:37,651 --> 00:51:39,060
with each other.
Um,

1168
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:43,770
and cooperating each other's testimony,
like the closest version because none of

1169
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:47,340
it seems to be very accurate.
Is that okay?

1170
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:50,700
Here's Hitler school.
And when they did the genetic testing,

1171
00:51:50,701 --> 00:51:53,190
it's that of a 35 year old woman.
So like,

1172
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,740
oh,
well this isn't Hitler.

1173
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,850
But they have said for the past 80 years
that this is Hitler.

1174
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,250
So,
okay,

1175
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,580
first before we start throwing stones at
Russia,

1176
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,470
let's go back to 1945.

1177
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,450
April Ma in Berlin,
you have the allies coming in,

1178
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,040
wrecking shop,
dropping bombs,

1179
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,440
blowing everything up.
They can in every single which way you

1180
00:52:16,441 --> 00:52:18,390
have the Russians coming from the
opposite direction.

1181
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,330
They don't even have enough guns to arm
all their soldiers.

1182
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,850
So if they have 200 guys that are
200,000 guys,

1183
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,220
they have 100,000 guns that the guy in
front of you dies.

1184
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:30,480
You just pick up his gun.
That's what's happening in April of 1945

1185
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,600
in Berlin.
So the noose is tightening.

1186
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,870
There is no,
it is chaos.

1187
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,150
Anarchy pandemonium.
This,

1188
00:52:39,151 --> 00:52:42,300
I mean you couldn't.
This is hell on earth is Berlin.

1189
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,260
Nineteen 45.
So I don't know if you could get a real

1190
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,630
story,
a real.

1191
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,240
The way that we do it now,
where we have,

1192
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,730
you know,
this forensic experts that come in and

1193
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,060
document everything and we look at all
the different testimonies.

1194
00:52:57,061 --> 00:52:59,400
Say this is this exactly how.
It's just not,

1195
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,400
it's not CSI.
This is 1945 Berlin.

1196
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,220
It's crazy.
So,

1197
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:09,960
so there's,
there was no like absolute proof.

1198
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,880
No.
And a lot of Nazis did escape and go to

1199
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:15,610
South America.
America,

1200
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,150
the majority of anyone with power,
the Nuremberg trials a,

1201
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,170
we're not a witch hunt,
but it was too close a chapter so we

1202
00:53:23,171 --> 00:53:25,060
could start moving forward with
communism.

1203
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,240
That's what it was.
The threat of fascism,

1204
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:33,600
the threat of Hitler,
that the threat of killing all the Jews,

1205
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:37,560
the threat of world domination by the
Nazis that threat's gone.

1206
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,680
What's the next threat?
Communism.

1207
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,290
Communism.
So that had to be a closed chapter of

1208
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:46,500
our history.
So we could focus our resources and our

1209
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:50,130
efforts to what inevitably was going to.
I mean the wall goes up.

1210
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,990
We have east and West Berlin,
you know,

1211
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:53,580
we're already looking at Korea.
I mean,

1212
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:55,050
this,
this happens almost overnight,

1213
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,780
no one patents like no,
no homies,

1214
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,490
we need to go all the way to Matt
Moscow.

1215
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:02,330
This is not the end of our war.
And we didn't listen to him.

1216
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,810
Um,
we then had been fighting communism for

1217
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:07,770
the past 75 years.

1218
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,730
So the ones with power that went to
South America,

1219
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:13,800
I know a bunch of them went to
Argentina.

1220
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,150
Uh,
they think,

1221
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,210
uh,
they went to Honduras and a few other

1222
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:20,820
places where,
where do they think they wound up?

1223
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,660
So what you had in South America,
both Chile and Argentina,

1224
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:29,661
back to back head fascist regimes.
You had a parone who was part of the

1225
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:33,030
Nazi party starting all the way back
into the mid thirties.

1226
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,290
He's the president of Argentina.
So the Red Cross,

1227
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,940
um,
they were facilitate.

1228
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,630
There was about three different rat
lines that guys were able to

1229
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:45,870
successfully get out of Europe,
into South America.

1230
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,230
Um,
and these are,

1231
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,960
there's no question that we're talking
thousands,

1232
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:54,840
if not tens of thousands of high ranking
Nazis made it there.

1233
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,580
Tens of thousands,
tens of thousands.

1234
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:58,950
And I'm not talking like little
soldiers.

1235
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:04,220
I'm talking high ranking Nazis officers
got guys like Joseph Mengele and Adolf

1236
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,131
Eichmann.
I mean,

1237
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:08,790
these are the most disgusting,
despicable humans to exist at the time.

1238
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,140
If Hill,
if Hitler is dead,

1239
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,340
Joseph Mengele is the guy that would
take syringes full of blue ink and

1240
00:55:14,341 --> 00:55:17,040
inject them and you have blue eyes,
Joe,

1241
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,280
or you have brown eyes.
Let me see if I can make them blue and

1242
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:23,310
then take twins and start torturing them
to see if one would feel the pain.

1243
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:24,960
That's Josef Mengele.
I mean,

1244
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:27,870
that's the guy that then in South
America was helping.

1245
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,610
Um,
high ranking Argentinians have abortions

1246
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:33,690
and he set up,
um,

1247
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,870
have you seen the movie Colonia about
Colonia Dignity?

1248
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,260
Dad,
which has that,

1249
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,780
if you're listening right now,
almost warn you not to google it because

1250
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:46,020
it is it.
It was a torture camp that was started

1251
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:51,021
by Joseph Shaffer,
a Nazi and Joseph Mengele the doctor of

1252
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:57,150
death that escaped trial in Nuremberg
and made it.

1253
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,610
I'm at the behest of parone into
Argentina.

1254
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:02,300
He sat at the hospital at Colonia
dignity that,

1255
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,960
which was another safe house,
safe haven for more Nazis in South

1256
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,793
America.

1257
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,410
Go to my ehr and David,
Ben Gurion,

1258
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,480
the presidents of Israel.
Um,

1259
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,750
they,
they took the gloves off and they were

1260
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,270
just sending assassins to try to find
these people and killed them.

1261
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,330
Um,
but what you got in South America were

1262
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,720
isolated German only communities.
You could go into Bariloche,

1263
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:27,310
Argentina,
and you know,

1264
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:28,860
I'd be like,
what else is Migos?

1265
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,110
And they're like,
Guten Morgen.

1266
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,590
I'm like,
Oh yeah.

1267
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:34,090
I mean I met.
Good morning.

1268
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:34,930
Yeah,
sorry.

1269
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,670
It's 2017,
right?

1270
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:41,530
I thought we spoke Spanish.
So in 2017 you were there and they were

1271
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:42,500
speaking German.
Yeah.

1272
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,800
Whoa.
Why I'm,

1273
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,240
I don't look very.
I might look more European than we do

1274
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,040
show is just them seeing me walking down
the street and be like,

1275
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,820
wow.
And there's tons of communities.

1276
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:57,970
I mean if you go to Colonia digged the
data which is now called via Bavaria,

1277
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,540
the Bavarian village,
it is a only German in the center of

1278
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:06,730
Chile,
in the mountains of Chile.

1279
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,180
Like you,
there's no Spanish being spoken there.

1280
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:14,290
It is exclusively German and these are
descendants of Nazis.

1281
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,290
He powerful Nazis.
Holy Shit.

1282
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,940
And this is going on right now.
And what are these communities like?

1283
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:23,680
I mean,
what's their ideology or they.

1284
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,140
I mean,
they're pretty white.

1285
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:27,760
Yeah.
What are they like?

1286
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,740
Are they,
do they espouse Nazi values are not

1287
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,070
openly so colonia dignity dad.
Uh,

1288
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,970
if you look the second generation,
there's a bunch of.

1289
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:45,630
So it was a huge problem for Chile that
they tried to hide for years and they,

1290
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:51,660
they got so much power from the
torturing that they did at Colonia dicta

1291
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:56,670
dad on a whole bunch of other high
ranking South American dictators that

1292
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,080
they're almost untouchable.
And this,

1293
00:57:59,081 --> 00:57:59,860
this is,
I mean,

1294
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,230
you,
you'd blow your mind if you look into

1295
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:02,840
this jail,
you,

1296
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,640
you'd love it.
But I'm the second generation,

1297
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:08,050
the kids,
the grandkids,

1298
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:12,070
sometimes they're even more fanatical
than the original generation.

1299
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,980
Have you ever seen this where like if
somebody is away from,

1300
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,690
like when you travel abroad,
man,

1301
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:20,170
it's so cool to like get into the
culture and get into the food and get

1302
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:22,780
into the,
like you're dancing this style and you

1303
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:23,940
love the flag and you're like,
oh,

1304
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:25,930
I'm gonna go to a soccer game.
Because we don't go to soccer games in

1305
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:29,590
America that I'm going,
but then maybe after like two months you

1306
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:31,210
kind of miss home,
you know,

1307
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:36,211
and then like a year,
like you really miss home and then 10

1308
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:40,750
years like you really,
really miss home and you see the same

1309
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:44,380
thing in the United States where it's
not really a perfect assimilation.

1310
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:48,160
It's not the melting pot where you see
generations that are espousing to be

1311
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:51,490
more like their ethnic heritage than
they are American,

1312
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,710
you know,
they're flying the Irish flag and like

1313
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:54,610
I'm,
I'm Irish,

1314
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,960
I'm what's just times a thousand with
these communities because they're

1315
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,890
exclusively German.
Oh yeah.

1316
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,690
It's pretty cool.
Kind of weird.

1317
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,140
So exclusively German and really missing
home.

1318
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

1319
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,440
So in the years later,
the second generations I was talking

1320
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:15,320
about,
um,

1321
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:20,020
some of them came to the United States
and were high ranking white supremacists

1322
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:25,021
that are now in jail,
in prison for their racial crimes.

1323
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,800
And they came out of South America.
They came out of Colonia dignity.

1324
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:33,310
Dad that came out of low che.
They came out of that,

1325
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,000
came out of Ms Dot Joan as they came out
of.

1326
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,960
Yeah.
Wow,

1327
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,620
that's crazy.
So that's the show hunting.

1328
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,080
Hitler

1329
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,740
fucking a man to spread.
How many people are we talking about?

1330
00:59:43,741 --> 00:59:46,530
All told in South America that can come
out of this.

1331
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:50,440
I mean tens of thousands went there,
but how many German communities and

1332
00:59:50,441 --> 00:59:51,420
what?
How big are they?

1333
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:56,180
We maybe have 50 German communities.
Fifty fifth.

1334
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,980
How many people?
If you had to guess,

1335
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,710
a few hundred thousand.
Holy Shit.

1336
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:06,030
Few hundred thousand descendants of
Nazis.

1337
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,680
Wow.

1338
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:08,621
Yeah.
And me.

1339
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:13,621
And it's weird when you walk into
somebody's parlor and it's like you're

1340
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:16,990
stepping back in time into Europe.
Like I'm walking in,

1341
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:20,200
it's 2017 and I'm walking in Buenos
Aires,

1342
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:25,201
Argentina into somebody's parlor and all
of the tile is European and all of the

1343
01:00:26,801 --> 01:00:30,450
style and all the art is very German.
You know,

1344
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:35,490
we have like deers and know not,
not like red stags of what we're talking

1345
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,780
German,
everything.

1346
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,500
Things that Hitler loved and that's the
style.

1347
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:43,390
That's everything.
And then they come out and like with

1348
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,520
white gloves,
they're holding their GRANDPA,

1349
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:50,550
their grandfather's a memory box and
inside of it or his war medals from,

1350
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,520
you know,
when he was in the ss or when he was.

1351
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,540
And it is the respect the.
I don't even know the difference.

1352
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,450
Yeah.
I mean it's like whoa.

1353
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,650
Like it's the,
it's like this is a gift from the pope

1354
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,450
that they're holding their hands.

1355
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,500
White gloves.
No,

1356
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,670
I can't for.
First of all,

1357
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,960
tim can't touch it.
That's.

1358
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:14,560
But I can appreciate it.
And then they tell me the story of every

1359
01:01:14,561 --> 01:01:17,740
single one of these things and how he
got there and how he then went and

1360
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:20,140
worked for the miniseries.
News can't touch anything.

1361
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,580
No,
they wouldn't know because I come,

1362
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:22,780
you'll,
you're dirty,

1363
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,140
dirty,
dirty American America.

1364
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,170
He's goes to Brown.
Yeah.

1365
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:31,080
Fuck man.
So we followed the first two seasons.

1366
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:35,280
It was really just unraveling the rumors
of what happened to Hitler.

1367
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,480
The third season was my favorite because
I actually got to do real work.

1368
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,373
They said,
okay,

1369
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,310
I got to the second season I got to
bring in more special forces.

1370
01:01:43,311 --> 01:01:48,311
Guys.
I'm a CIA targeter Nadia who helped my

1371
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:55,001
unit kill Zarqawi in 2006 that this is
the team that is now looking at real

1372
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:58,700
evidence trying to figure out,
okay,

1373
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,530
how did we find Bin Ladin?

1374
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,190
How do we find the car is our county.
We looked at their associates and we

1375
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:06,290
looked at how they move.
We looked at how they communicated,

1376
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,380
we looked at what routes they were using
to get to and from places,

1377
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:12,380
and then we just started tightening the
noose and that's exactly what we did in

1378
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:14,210
this third season was,
okay,

1379
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:16,550
let's start following the Adolf
eichmanns.

1380
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,340
Let's start following the Josef Mengele
and let's start following the scores and

1381
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:24,150
skis.
Hitler's personal bodyguard,

1382
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,360
that was a colonel in the ss that went
onto work for everybody after the war

1383
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:33,510
fighting.
I mean fascists do not like communists.

1384
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:38,810
So this guy was working for everybody to
include the CIA fighting fascism and

1385
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:43,050
South America are fighting communism as
a fascist in South America in the

1386
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:43,711
fifties,
sixties,

1387
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,830
and seventies.
Creepy stuff.

1388
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,190
Yeah.
So,

1389
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:55,520
so haunting Hiller.
Are there any legitimate eye witness

1390
01:02:55,741 --> 01:03:00,390
accounts of Hitler in South America or
potentially legitimate?

1391
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,531
You?
Absolutely.

1392
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:02,940
Potentially.
Whoa.

1393
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,250
Yep.
I witnessed counts.

1394
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:10,251
I saw him get off a boat.
I saw him meet here and if it was just

1395
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,430
some person saying it,
it's almost meaningless.

1396
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,010
Right?
But if you look at the context of who

1397
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:19,590
this person is,
the wealth that they have that they

1398
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:23,520
shouldn't have and I can,
can you explain how you got so rich and

1399
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:25,180
two generations,
you know,

1400
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,950
like,
okay,

1401
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,700
your grandpa got here from Germany in
1946.

1402
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,670
That's weird.
Um,

1403
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,330
and he,
he,

1404
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,870
he's on a legitimate visa with an
Argentinian passport,

1405
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,250
also weird.
Um,

1406
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:43,230
and now he's a war refugee that's now
worth millions of dollars.

1407
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,870
How does this,
how does this work?

1408
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,263
So,

1409
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,540
but people.
And then this is the hard part.

1410
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,450
People want to be connected to
significant events and,

1411
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:59,190
and especially in small rural areas of
the world,

1412
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,080
developing areas like they want their.
So nothing there so little happening.

1413
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:06,240
They want to be attached to something
massive.

1414
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,660
And like the fact that they saw you boat
land on this beach and the pop,

1415
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:14,580
the hatch opened and you know,
this,

1416
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,300
these cars were sitting there and they
were doing morse code and this guy gets

1417
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:20,140
off and he had this little mustache.
You're like,

1418
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:25,380
W for u boats can't beach.
That's not how that works.

1419
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,030
But you know what they're trying to do.
They just want to be connected.

1420
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,140
Yeah.
So,

1421
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,680
and now we're removed 70 to 80 years
from the facts.

1422
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:39,750
It has been painful to try to use real
science,

1423
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,230
real investigative tools to try to sift
through

1424
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,410
this lore.
You know?

1425
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,000
What do you think happened?
I mean,

1426
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:51,520
you've been,
you've been studying this for how long

1427
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:52,730
now?
Three years.

1428
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,790
Three years.
If you had to guess,

1429
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,520
if you had like a million bucks,
you've got to put it on one side or

1430
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:58,450
another.
Did he go there?

1431
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,330
Yeah.
Whoa.

1432
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,730
Jesus Christ.
I would say,

1433
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,083
man,
it's that.

1434
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:07,390
That's the first time I've ever said it
flat out like that.

1435
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,740
What would I want to say is the way
history is written is wrong.

1436
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,780
That that's,
that's clear.

1437
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,930
There's no way that we can say he died
on this day,

1438
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,090
this is what happened.
Here is his body.

1439
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,280
And that's what a physical proof is.
For sure.

1440
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,210
The woman that had,
they were saying was Hitler is

1441
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:26,590
definitely not Hitler.
He's absolutely.

1442
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,120
That's a.
So they don't have Hitler's body.

1443
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:30,990
So then our other option was kate,
is it ava?

1444
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,440
Brahms did.

1445
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,380
He just grabbed the wrong body.
Right.

1446
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:38,550
So there are still descendants of,
of eva and we tried to have them allow

1447
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:42,930
us to do it.
Then we tried to go through like,

1448
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,060
um,
and they can get DNA off of the skull.

1449
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,420
Just meat on it.
It's like a tooth.

1450
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,850
Yeah.
And um,

1451
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,610
but they wouldn't consent to it.
So then we tried to.

1452
01:05:54,611 --> 01:05:57,700
Do you know where people have like the
tree,

1453
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:01,990
they're ethnic treat.
What are those websites called?

1454
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,340
Twenty three in me.
Yeah.

1455
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,330
Yeah.
There's like a bunch of them.

1456
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,520
We try to go that route,
but

1457
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,870
that wouldn't consent to it.
Nope.

1458
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:12,520
The Eva Braun's family,
they just want it gone.

1459
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:14,340
They just don't want.
Yeah,

1460
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:16,900
there are super pissed that we even
found them,

1461
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,340
I'm sure.
Which was hard.

1462
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,580
Which is really hard.
Hold them down and get them to spit in

1463
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:22,414
the bucket.
Yeah,

1464
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:25,630
the uh,
I know,

1465
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:30,730
I mean,
or pull the trash and pull stuff out of

1466
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:30,880
there.

1467
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,170
Now it was totally not.
Do that.

1468
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,030
Definitely not do that.
Um,

1469
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,780
but I mean that's how they caught the
golden state killer,

1470
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:39,130
right?
It was off a cigarette.

1471
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:42,340
But yeah,
they got dna off a cigarette butt.

1472
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,460
So history is wrong for it to be black
and white like that and fuck man.

1473
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,300
And if,
and again,

1474
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:51,500
if you go back to 1945,
um,

1475
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,180
we needed scientists.
We needed every single German,

1476
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,360
electrical engineer,
mechanical engineer,

1477
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,070
aerospace.
Anything.

1478
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,560
You're on the [inaudible] program,
you know,

1479
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,790
any,
we will,

1480
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,470
all of you.
Because now it's a race.

1481
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,690
It's a race.
We have the bomb,

1482
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,810
now we need delivery systems.
Now we need to get to the moon.

1483
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:14,440
Now we need to know like all of those
things are real time.

1484
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,560
It's a war,
a war of dollars and a wharf science.

1485
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,710
And um,
we got all those scientists.

1486
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,800
The Russians didn't.
Well they got some,

1487
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,670
some not very many.
Operation paperclip was what

1488
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,450
brought over the what?
Wernher von Braun,

1489
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,300
who was,
when you talk to Jews that were in

1490
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:35,960
Berlin during the time that Wernher von
Braun was running his rocket program

1491
01:07:35,961 --> 01:07:40,490
there,
he would hang the five slowest Jews in

1492
01:07:40,491 --> 01:07:44,750
front of the rocket factory in Berlin.
Just to give everybody motivation to

1493
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:45,710
work harder.
Yeah.

1494
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:47,930
It's.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if

1495
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:50,540
Wernher von Braun was alive today,
they would prosecute him for crimes

1496
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:53,030
against humanity.
He was a Nazi,

1497
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:56,150
straight up Nazi and people there's
apologist that say,

1498
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:56,361
no,
no,

1499
01:07:56,361 --> 01:07:57,590
no.
He was a scientist.

1500
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:59,480
He was forced into doing that.
Like that's like,

1501
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,310
okay,
he's a Nazi.

1502
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,330
There's photographs of him wearing Nazi
garb hanging out with Nazis.

1503
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,940
He,
his rocket factory killed Jews like this

1504
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:10,630
is.
These are all undeniable

1505
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,620
except the war ends and they're not.
Not.

1506
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,450
That's not how that works.
Exactly,

1507
01:08:14,451 --> 01:08:16,160
but they were.
They were forgiven

1508
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,820
because they came over and contributed
to our rocket program.

1509
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:21,260
Not that I'm not that good of a human.
I don't have that in me.

1510
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:22,423
I don't have that.
Like,

1511
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,950
okay,
you're forgiven because they wanted to

1512
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:27,700
beat the Russians and they knew the
Russians got a bunch of them to know,

1513
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,720
you know,
the Russians got a bunch of them for

1514
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:31,700
their rocket propelled.
The Egyptians did.

1515
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:35,680
The Egyptians were trying to create a
delivery system to drop bombs into

1516
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:38,660
Israel.
And then Ben Gurion started having these

1517
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:41,660
Nazi scientists tried to have them
assassinated.

1518
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,830
They were mailing the facade was,
how are you familiar with this facade

1519
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:49,910
was mailing package bombs into Egypt and
throughout Europe trying to kill these,

1520
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,080
these German scientists.
And they were all German Nazi rocket

1521
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,310
guys that were working for Egypt,
Egypt and Egypt and wanting to go blow

1522
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,580
Israel.
This is into the sixties.

1523
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,550
So they're still trying to find ways to
kill the Jews and they're like,

1524
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:05,480
oh yeah,
we'll go work for you.

1525
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,410
Egypt,
you know,

1526
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:11,411
so it sounds crazy is how fucking
technologically advanced that Germans

1527
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:13,610
were so far ahead of us.
It's so amazing.

1528
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:16,340
And to this day you drive a bmw and you
go,

1529
01:09:16,341 --> 01:09:19,370
Whoa,
on human fuckers are on point.

1530
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,980
Yeah.
Chevy Malibu right now.

1531
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:24,800
And I'm like,
you drive a corvette,

1532
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,230
get a new corvette.
They're pretty fucking bad ass.

1533
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,760
It's on what you buy.
But I mean,

1534
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:33,170
I mean there's German engineering in the
eighties is fucking phenomenal.

1535
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,100
I mean if you drove a German car for the
19 eighties and an American car from the

1536
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,990
eighties,
it's like there's no comparison.

1537
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:44,390
Now I have a 1991 porsche and it's a
fucking piece of engineering man.

1538
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:49,430
It's a marvel of engineering.
It's not fast like a modern car.

1539
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:54,500
But when you compare like the build
quality and how they constructed it and

1540
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,200
how it's put together in comparison to
a.

1541
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,550
I'll fucking dodge Daytona from 1990.
That's a hunk of shit.

1542
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,920
Nobody wants one of those today.
Well,

1543
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:05,600
I mean,
unless you're going to build a VB IED

1544
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,840
than you want it.
Oh that's the only time you'd.

1545
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,460
If you could blow it up again,
it's you.

1546
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:11,840
The way you think is different.
You know,

1547
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:16,900
13 year old child trafficking,
counterfeit money and it's will be.

1548
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:22,010
We'll be in some country and I'll be
walking by and I'll look at a car and be

1549
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:25,490
like,
that would make a great bomb and I swear

1550
01:10:25,491 --> 01:10:28,370
to God she would go through my head,
you know?

1551
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,960
Yeah,
yeah.

1552
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,710
Well that's how the business works.
We'll grow up someday.

1553
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:39,220
So when you're over there in Argentina
and you're meeting with these people and

1554
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:44,321
you know that the descendants of Nazis
and they'll bring out this grandfathers

1555
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,010
chest of things and war medals and all
this jazz,

1556
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:51,380
like,
what is this feeling like?

1557
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:54,170
Do you feel like these people got away
with something and then they kind of

1558
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,240
did,
but these aren't the people that did it,

1559
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:59,870
but they're the descendants of the
people that did it and they're still

1560
01:10:59,871 --> 01:11:01,960
worshiping those people in some way.
Yeah.

1561
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,320
I had,
um,

1562
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:08,620
I had a lot of soul searching.
I'm trying to figure out what is the

1563
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:12,350
appropriate thing,
what's the appropriate spots?

1564
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,430
What am I seeing?
What am I supposed to be feeling

1565
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,900
right now?
And I think I'm a pretty.

1566
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,380
I'm exposed person.
Like I'm in tuned with what I feel and

1567
01:11:22,081 --> 01:11:27,081
I'm one of the hardest days.
We're in Chile and I interviewed this,

1568
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,910
this man and this woman,
and uh,

1569
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,040
they are both.
One of them is a second generation.

1570
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:42,050
She was born on a Colonia dignity dad on
this compound as a Nazi.

1571
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:45,140
I'm separated from her parents.
She didn't know who her parents was,

1572
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:45,561
not,
I'm sorry,

1573
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:47,750
I'm sorry.
She was brought there at like age three

1574
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:49,790
or four,
but she grew up there and see,

1575
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,090
and they're separated from parents who
are parents was her husband,

1576
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:58,150
was a Chilean boy that was local and he
heard about this new hospital that's

1577
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:03,720
built by Dr Mengele and um,
how everybody has food there and he's a

1578
01:12:03,801 --> 01:12:08,801
porch lane kid.
So he was able to get onto the compound.

1579
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:13,160
Um,
well the locals and the Germans aren't

1580
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:16,700
supposed to be together.
So he was kind of kept separated.

1581
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,260
What?
Because he was local,

1582
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,360
they started testing him,
um,

1583
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,400
and grow.

1584
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:28,330
It got really violent and disgusting.
By the time he is a teenager,

1585
01:12:28,331 --> 01:12:31,360
he's been thrown out of out of windows,
having his bones broken,

1586
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,730
being nursed back to health,
being set on fire,

1587
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:37,570
be nurse back to health for like 10,
15 years.

1588
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:43,380
He finally talks his what will be his
future wife into escaping with him and

1589
01:12:44,321 --> 01:12:48,400
they sneak out on in a chief's truck
because one of his friends,

1590
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,060
when he was a Chilean kid,
grew up to be a police officer in nearby

1591
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:54,310
and he was able to get a letter out to
them and be like,

1592
01:12:54,311 --> 01:12:56,320
please come help us.
And they came in and do a health

1593
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:59,110
inspection and they hopped inside of
this cheese cheese truck and they got

1594
01:12:59,111 --> 01:12:59,750
away.
So I'm,

1595
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:04,480
I'm talking to this guy and he's telling
me about the things that happened to

1596
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,400
them and I'm not going to get into it.

1597
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,830
I mean,
but they were the most horrible things

1598
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:11,020
that could happen to a little boy that
you could imagine,

1599
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,300
you know,
beyond rape,

1600
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,920
beyond being burnt,
alive,

1601
01:13:14,921 --> 01:13:18,580
beyond being broken for,
for years and years and years.

1602
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,880
And I'm shaking because I,
I,

1603
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:23,770
man,
I'm in Afghanistan and you know,

1604
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,150
they threw some acid on some kids and I
found those guys to kill those guys

1605
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,300
because that's what you do when you,
when you hurt little kids.

1606
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,710
Um,
you know,

1607
01:13:32,711 --> 01:13:35,900
I got a soft spot for people that can't
take care of themselves,

1608
01:13:35,901 --> 01:13:39,190
that can protect themselves.
I think every real human isn't gonna let

1609
01:13:39,191 --> 01:13:42,130
anything weaker them ever get hurt in
front of them.

1610
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:44,590
And so I'm shaking,
listen to the story,

1611
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:45,910
you know,
and I was like,

1612
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,980
and I know I have to go back to Colonia
digging dad the next day and put on like

1613
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:55,900
I'm a tourist guy hosting a travel show
and that that's always our disguise to

1614
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:56,280
get in there.

1615
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,113
And was like,
Oh,

1616
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,990
you know,
this is a beautiful Bavarian village.

1617
01:13:58,991 --> 01:14:00,490
You can come here.
That was the,

1618
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:05,670
our little way in and I was just going
to go in and destroy that whole entire

1619
01:14:07,931 --> 01:14:09,280
place.
That was my plan.

1620
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,900
And the guy's looking at me and he's
like,

1621
01:14:10,901 --> 01:14:13,260
I see your anger,
you know?

1622
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,270
And I was like,
yeah,

1623
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:15,580
I'm going to go hurt.
All of them.

1624
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:16,290
He's like,
no,

1625
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,830
you no more pain.
And I said,

1626
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:20,390
okay,
what do you,

1627
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,140
what's going on?
He looks at his wife and he goes,

1628
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,400
that's.
She saved me every time that I burned.

1629
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,360
Every time that was broken,
it was just love.

1630
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,120
That's how I got out.
That's why we're alive today and we're

1631
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:34,870
going to die of old age together with a
woman that I fell in love with on this

1632
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:37,180
colony.
The only thing that matters is love.

1633
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,040
And I was like,
God damn,

1634
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,670
I like you,
but I still want to go hurt.

1635
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,460
All of those people,
you know.

1636
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:46,360
So it's like,
so these people that were doing this to

1637
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:47,830
him,
what was,

1638
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,960
what was their objective?
They wanted to understand.

1639
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:52,210
I mean,
so the same test that Joseph Mengele was

1640
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:57,211
doing in Germany in 1943,
he's now doing in Chile in 1953.

1641
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,900
He just has a different population to
test.

1642
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,040
They're not Jews there,
chalene boys.

1643
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:09,040
And they're strong and they're wirey and
the less food,

1644
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:11,200
they're not like the,
I'm using quotation marks,

1645
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:14,110
the cockroach Jews that you just
couldn't kill,

1646
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:14,920
you know,
these were,

1647
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,670
these were young strong browns.
Like these are their words verbatim that

1648
01:15:18,671 --> 01:15:20,190
I'm using,
you know?

1649
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,390
And he's like,
yeah,

1650
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,300
I want to tell your guys' faces out and
stick soldering irons in your ear

1651
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:26,470
because you guys are so evil.

1652
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,750
But then I'm the same as them.
So I just really torn.

1653
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,160
I didn't know what to do.
I just want to kill them all.

1654
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,150
Well,
it's on the worst aspects of human

1655
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:39,151
beings is the desire to hurt people that
are weaker than you and tortured them.

1656
01:15:39,821 --> 01:15:42,550
And this is just coming into contact
with that.

1657
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:45,160
And then some guy who has this most
beautiful response to it.

1658
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,090
Yeah.
You know,

1659
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,430
I'm love saved.
I just want to die.

1660
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,320
Oh fuck.
You're a better human than I.

1661
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,290
So I never knew how to respond to these
things.

1662
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:57,340
I wanted to.
Every time I'd see a new ss metal or I'd

1663
01:15:57,341 --> 01:16:02,341
see this the cross that they won for
valor like crazy.

1664
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:06,700
The equivalent of Medal of honors these
guys have in there.

1665
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:10,500
Parlors are like,
these were Nazis.

1666
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:12,760
You realize your grandpa?
Yeah.

1667
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:14,200
Yes,
yes.

1668
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:18,070
Total pride.
Swelling in their chest,

1669
01:16:18,071 --> 01:16:18,580
you know,
I was like,

1670
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,413
oh no.

1671
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,790
Cracking the face dude.
How did Mengele die?

1672
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:23,380
Did he die of old age?
Old Age.

1673
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:27,670
He died on a beach in Brazil.
His Journal was found on the beach in

1674
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,230
Brazil.
Mother fucker.

1675
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,270
Yeah.
Married a beautiful Brazilian girl.

1676
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,720
Wow.
Adolf Eichmann.

1677
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:37,510
He got snatched by,
um,

1678
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:42,250
the,
the massaad in Argentina scores and ski.

1679
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,390
He died of old age actually in the 19 in
the sixties.

1680
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,660
The Egyptians,
when they're trying to build that rocket

1681
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:51,700
plug program to,
to annihilate the,

1682
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:54,400
a,
to annihilate Israel scores.

1683
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:59,170
NCS started working for the facade,
but he didn't really know it for their

1684
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:01,120
pain.
Him millions of millions of dollars to

1685
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,800
hold these parties for what he thought
was the rise of the Fourth Reich.

1686
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,950
Whoa.
Yeah.

1687
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:11,130
He was bringing in like,
um,

1688
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,900
Mercedes and a crucial,
crucial steel steel crushed,

1689
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,390
steal these,
these massive billion dollar

1690
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:25,391
corporations for the time he was hosting
these soirees and talk and having other

1691
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:28,130
high level Nazis that were still alive
come in.

1692
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,830
And um,
he was just really being used by the

1693
01:17:30,831 --> 01:17:34,550
massage to try to figure out who was
facilitating this Egyptian rocket

1694
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:37,190
program.
So they've just been putting on these

1695
01:17:37,191 --> 01:17:40,460
parties to kind of get everybody
together so they could keep tabs on

1696
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:42,860
everybody and figure out who's who.
That's what the facade was doing.

1697
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,960
He was doing it with the intent of
making the forthright,

1698
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,300
yeah,
rising the Fourth Reich.

1699
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,930
So the massage did this and then what
did they do once they figured out who

1700
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:53,900
was who
finally,

1701
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:58,160
they don't like this part because I like
just getting killing bad people.

1702
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,760
Um,
they figured out that the,

1703
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:04,460
the,
the big problem with the delivery system

1704
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:09,461
for the Egyptians in their missile
program was the navigation system and

1705
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:13,340
they are trying to hire a whole bunch of
these experts,

1706
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:17,120
um,
to come work for this program.

1707
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:22,400
And they diplomatically kind of went
behind the back and they got all of

1708
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:24,650
this,
this really the only experts in the

1709
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:27,020
world,
they prevented them from going and

1710
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:29,730
traveling to and work for Egypt.
Um,

1711
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:34,910
so they kind of diplomatically ended the
development of delivery system for

1712
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:36,230
their,
their warheads.

1713
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,270
So that's how they handled it.
After they poisoned some people and they

1714
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,660
sent some mail bombs,
they kidnapped a guy and tortured him

1715
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:47,660
and killed him.
Fuck yeah.

1716
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,160
Real,
real torture.

1717
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:50,480
Not,
not fake torture.

1718
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:55,690
It's amazing how few people know about
the Nazi escapees that went to South

1719
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,460
America.
It's,

1720
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,150
it's amazing how when this comes up,
it's,

1721
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,490
it's relatively unknown.
I mean,

1722
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:07,310
your show has done a lot to shed some
light on it.

1723
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:11,450
And I've read some articles about Nazis
that escaped to South America,

1724
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,490
but it's not common knowledge.
No.

1725
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,560
By design,
I mean when you're down there,

1726
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,760
there is a,
there's a shroud of silence.

1727
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,880
You,
you,

1728
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,730
you're not supposed to talk about these
things.

1729
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,850
The,
it takes a long time for me to get an

1730
01:19:26,851 --> 01:19:31,110
interview with a guy.
It takes a long time for building

1731
01:19:31,111 --> 01:19:31,861
rapport.
I mean,

1732
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:35,690
we're talking like we have some pretty
high level people working with me,

1733
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:40,260
special operations from every single
branch to include the CIA,

1734
01:19:40,261 --> 01:19:45,261
Army special forces and we are pulling
out every trick in the book to try to

1735
01:19:45,451 --> 01:19:50,451
get these people to talk to us to
include bribing them and the um,

1736
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,793
it's hard.

1737
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,570
So they,
they still don't talk about it.

1738
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:58,090
To this day.
Did you have to bring in German speaking

1739
01:19:58,091 --> 01:19:58,880
people?
Yeah,

1740
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,610
a lot of time.
Wow.

1741
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,640
I mean,
what can be done?

1742
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:08,910
I mean there's not the same people,
right?

1743
01:20:08,911 --> 01:20:11,280
These are people that benefited from the
people that went down there.

1744
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,100
So you're talking about like third
generation removed,

1745
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:16,400
but what can be done?
Uh,

1746
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:19,080
the kind of the damage is done,
right?

1747
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,180
Yeah.
But that's a lot of damage.

1748
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,950
What can be done is the ideas can die.
The ideas of,

1749
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,560
of fascism,
the ideas of racism,

1750
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,110
the,
the,

1751
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:30,060
those,
those things.

1752
01:20:30,061 --> 01:20:34,290
We can kill 'em.
But are those ideas,

1753
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,550
are those ideas being fostered in these,
these communities?

1754
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:39,861
Yes.
Yeah,

1755
01:20:39,861 --> 01:20:40,770
there are being cultivated.

1756
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,430
Yeah.
Because like you experienced it.

1757
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

1758
01:20:45,781 --> 01:20:46,800
I mean,
if I'm a white guy,

1759
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,960
white guy walking down the street,
I am,

1760
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:53,240
I am a higher degree than the locals,
you know,

1761
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,710
like I can,
I can go and shop in some places that

1762
01:20:55,711 --> 01:20:58,470
they can't.
I can go in and sit down and have a meal

1763
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,540
in some places that they can't.
I can.

1764
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,370
And being greeted on the street and good
Morgan,

1765
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,140
you know,
I'm not,

1766
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,450
not the brown dude next to me.
He's not.

1767
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:11,451
And His kid definitely can't date the
blue eyed blonde girl at the high school

1768
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,810
that's not allowed.
So they basically created these little

1769
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:17,730
colonies.
Yeah.

1770
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:21,900
Yahtzee colonies in South America.
Did you Google Google Colonia dignity

1771
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:25,860
that you will have nightmares?
Do not freak it out right now.

1772
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:28,320
It's done.
It's crazy how many people got away with

1773
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:32,210
it that Joseph Mengele died on a beach
and wife.

1774
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:33,191
I mean,
that,

1775
01:21:33,191 --> 01:21:33,560
that,
that,

1776
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,780
that would hurt me because he's a guy
like me just on the ops because he,

1777
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,250
I mean,
he's a special operations guy.

1778
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:39,510
He was an ss.
Um,

1779
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:40,080
he,
he was,

1780
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,390
he was a physical specimen,
especially for the time,

1781
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:42,980
you know,
like we didn't,

1782
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,190
we didn't understand.
I mean,

1783
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:48,270
he was,
he was very early on into the,

1784
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:50,700
one of the first real Nazis,
like,

1785
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:53,610
this isn't okay,
all of Germany's going this way.

1786
01:21:53,611 --> 01:21:57,690
The chancellor is Adolf Hitler.
This is where we're going.

1787
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:01,770
I kind of just have to go along and you
see some of that in the third,

1788
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,720
like 43,
44.

1789
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,130
I'm now.
It's okay.

1790
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:07,530
We might be losing this war now.
It's not so invoke.

1791
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:13,040
But when you got guys like 1939 that are
talking eugenics and um,

1792
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:18,990
you know,
higher calling for breeding and

1793
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,700
segregation.
Um,

1794
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,590
early on you're like,
Eh,

1795
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:23,933
I don't like that guy.

1796
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:27,810
Gonna beat him to death with my hands,
but he's massive.

1797
01:22:27,811 --> 01:22:31,400
So it'd be a pretty good fight.
It was a,

1798
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:34,410
there we go form Nazi cult.
Trying to.

1799
01:22:34,411 --> 01:22:35,910
What does it say?
Jamie was the full,

1800
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:37,650
uh,
full Nazi Colt.

1801
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,690
What is the uh,
so that,

1802
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:41,640
that,
that's just a marketing thing because

1803
01:22:41,641 --> 01:22:44,100
it's still the same place.
Reformed Nazi,

1804
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:46,470
cult trying to open it's colony to
tourism.

1805
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,180
And where's this?
That's in Chile.

1806
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,910
Yeah.
I spent a lot of time.

1807
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:54,870
They're right there.
They made a movie about it.

1808
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:59,340
So that's current day right there.
Jesus Christ.

1809
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:03,450
That later hose in range is freaking
gorgeous though.

1810
01:23:03,451 --> 01:23:04,051
It's,
I mean,

1811
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:09,051
it is Shangri a German flag flying.
They've tried to hide the Nazi things

1812
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,790
they've had.
I had dinner right there.

1813
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,170
Look at them all.
I know,

1814
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,280
I know.
That got in the left.

1815
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:17,143
Do you really?

1816
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:20,210
Yep.
What's that bro?

1817
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,240
We talked in the butchery there is right
now.

1818
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,100
Um,
so I had this guy with me,

1819
01:23:28,101 --> 01:23:30,260
Mike Simpson,
he is a,

1820
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:34,580
he works with me a sheepdog response.
He's a doctor.

1821
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:38,990
He was a ranger that became a green
beret that then went to medical school

1822
01:23:38,991 --> 01:23:40,820
and then came back to special
operations,

1823
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:43,610
um,
for the rest of the war.

1824
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,830
And he's our director of training for
sheepdog response.

1825
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,900
He was with me.
He and I both speak Spanish when we were

1826
01:23:47,901 --> 01:23:49,580
down there,
but they didn't know that he was a

1827
01:23:49,581 --> 01:23:52,640
doctor and they didn't know that we
spoke Spanish and they didn't know that

1828
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:56,390
our translator that looked very Chilean
could also speak German,

1829
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,730
perfect German.
She translates for Porsche,

1830
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,000
so they thought that they could have all
these little conversations with the

1831
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:07,430
stupid hairy handed.
I'm Irish guy hosts from the tourism

1832
01:24:07,431 --> 01:24:10,020
channel that [inaudible] they could get
away.

1833
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:12,570
Well,
we understood everything that they're

1834
01:24:12,571 --> 01:24:16,710
saying are they saying.
So one of our tour guides was formally a

1835
01:24:16,711 --> 01:24:21,540
nurse in the hospital that they closed
down and we stole one of their little ID

1836
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:24,810
cards to get into that hospital and we
stole a bunch of documents of them

1837
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:28,410
documenting them,
torturing little kids in the hospital

1838
01:24:28,411 --> 01:24:30,730
and the hospital.
None of this made the air because it's,

1839
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,760
it's.
There's so much litigation going on

1840
01:24:32,761 --> 01:24:36,900
where all of these victims of Colonia
dignity that are suing via Bavaria.

1841
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,290
And what time period are you talking
about when they were torturing kids?

1842
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,580
Like when was this?
Sixties to nineties.

1843
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,533
Wow.

1844
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:50,420
And so this is essentially Nazis and the
ancestors of Nazis carrying on those

1845
01:24:50,421 --> 01:24:54,980
practices in secret
Jesus Christ.

1846
01:24:54,981 --> 01:24:55,814
It's crazy,
man.

1847
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:57,890
Isn't this,
isn't just people that got away with it.

1848
01:24:57,891 --> 01:25:00,710
And then their ancestors moved here and
they evolved and changed.

1849
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,110
And what you do at that place,
you said the pitchers that,

1850
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:03,590
that,
that,

1851
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:08,590
that place is worth maybe $100,000,000
and they bought that with Nazi money.

1852
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:12,590
What do you do with that?
Where does that go?

1853
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:15,950
Where does that go?
I don't know the Nazi money.

1854
01:25:15,951 --> 01:25:19,760
We're talking,
we're talking melted fillings from Jews

1855
01:25:19,761 --> 01:25:22,920
mouths.
We're talking wedding rings off of Jews

1856
01:25:22,921 --> 01:25:25,940
fingers.
They bought that land with that money.

1857
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,090
It's gorgeous.
Jesus Christ.

1858
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:33,350
And they have a German colony there.
What?

1859
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,790
I Dunno,
I dunno what the right answer is.

1860
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:35,200
I mean,
what,

1861
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,020
how does Chili feel about it?
Chile has been in a tough position

1862
01:25:39,021 --> 01:25:43,130
because of the amount of power that they
have had their nobody.

1863
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:44,600
So in,
um,

1864
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:49,370
in the sixties,
they were at behest of the president.

1865
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:52,170
They were bringing in,
um,

1866
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:57,430
people that disagreed with the dictator
and they were torturing them and they're

1867
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,540
getting that information and giving it
back to the president.

1868
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,960
Um,
well that went on for like 10 years.

1869
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:07,330
And so the,
the Nazis were doing that for yes,

1870
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:10,880
for um,
oh my God,

1871
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:14,150
I cannot believe I have whoever the
dictator was so embarrassed.

1872
01:26:14,151 --> 01:26:16,280
I can't remember his name right now
because it's around the tip of my tongue

1873
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:19,340
anyway.
But that information they also had.

1874
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:24,550
So not only the information went back to
the president that he could use against

1875
01:26:25,461 --> 01:26:29,960
his rivals,
but they also had it so they know all

1876
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:33,380
the dirt about everybody they know who
is having sex with who,

1877
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:36,140
who has a kid with who,
who went to this prostitute place,

1878
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,220
who has a deal with the CIA,
who's working with the Venezuelans,

1879
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:41,930
who's working with the Argentinians.

1880
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:45,230
Like they have all that dirt because
they gave it to the president.

1881
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,940
They have it too.
So they had been untouchable politically

1882
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:53,630
for 30,
40 years because they had so much power

1883
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:58,220
because they had so much information
because they had so much dirt on every

1884
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:01,370
single high ranking person in South
America.

1885
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,050
Jesus Christ.
Now.

1886
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,770
That's been a tricky year for me from
that show.

1887
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:10,550
And then straight into hard to kill show
for the discovery channel from going

1888
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,530
then deployed to Africa.
Like this year.

1889
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,610
I don't even know.
I can't even.

1890
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,520
How does that all work while you're
still serving?

1891
01:27:16,521 --> 01:27:19,720
Like how do you get the freedom to do
all these different things when you read

1892
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,820
after you reenlisted?
So the army will always get with the

1893
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,770
army once,
um,

1894
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,930
first of all,
but it's got to help them.

1895
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,890
Having you be so high profile.
That's a huge presented live of the

1896
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:31,724
military.

1897
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,250
If you're listening to right now,
go to your local recruiter.

1898
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,600
That's why.
Seriously we are having special forces

1899
01:27:38,601 --> 01:27:41,810
specifically we are,
we are going to have the biggest deficit

1900
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:47,200
of eligible up a pool,
a population to select from because you

1901
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:50,060
have to have a certain level of
intelligence,

1902
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:53,810
a certain level of physicality.
Just to be eligible for special forces

1903
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:57,080
to pick from you.
That pool is the smallest that has ever

1904
01:27:57,081 --> 01:28:00,590
been in history.
Why kids are playing video games.

1905
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:05,620
They're not eating cheetos.
I'm less participation in sports.

1906
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,720
I mean if you could just go to a high
school,

1907
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,090
it'll at a high schooler now compared to
20 years ago.

1908
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,950
It's a different thing.
Really.

1909
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:13,651
Yeah.
We,

1910
01:28:13,651 --> 01:28:17,720
we,
we weren't like barely getting kids past

1911
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:20,810
obesity 20 years ago.
Now in high school

1912
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:24,710
if you walk into a classroom,
half the kids are obese,

1913
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:27,350
so you think this is just because
they're sedentary because they're

1914
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:29,780
playing video games and fucking around
online all day.

1915
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:33,110
It's not just.
It's not me thinking this is us.

1916
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:36,050
Absolutely.
Quantifiably saying we do not have

1917
01:28:36,051 --> 01:28:38,230
enough people to to pick from.
Right.

1918
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,440
That would be one of the best ways to
really find out what the actual average

1919
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:47,600
health of viable males is.
Right?

1920
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:48,590
Yeah,
for sure.

1921
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:52,970
There's always going to be the best of
the best that want to test themselves.

1922
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:54,980
I mean,
this is just always how it's been.

1923
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:56,840
Yeah,
so we teach 100 forces.

1924
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:00,320
We only have that 100.
We only get six or eight,

1925
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,870
but that's a hundred people that go to
special forces selection.

1926
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:07,710
That hundred that goes,
they have to have a GT score.

1927
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:10,920
They have to.
They have to have us scores high enough

1928
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:13,170
on the military entrance exams.
Just to be eligible.

1929
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,070
They have to have a pt score high enough
just to be eligible so we can't even get

1930
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:20,790
that 100 and then 100,
only eight or the eight of them are

1931
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:21,624
making it.

1932
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:22,950
So we're.
We're.

1933
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:26,430
This is to answer your question,
how I'm able to do these things is I'm

1934
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:29,010
in a position where I can say for the
love of God,

1935
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:32,730
please get healthy.
Please walk to your recruiter's office

1936
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:37,320
and please take a test to see if you're
eligible because we are just needing

1937
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:39,000
people like we've never needed them
before.

1938
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,300
It's scary.
Wow.

1939
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:46,530
Well that's one of the best indications.
I mean most people don't know or people

1940
01:29:46,531 --> 01:29:48,540
like me.
I'm 50 year old father,

1941
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:50,150
tax payer out there,
do much.

1942
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:52,090
I'm not paying attention to what fucking
high school kids look.

1943
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,090
I don't have no idea.
Yeah,

1944
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:56,580
I do go to like a marine recruiter right
now and be like,

1945
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:57,810
hey bro,
how's your job right now?

1946
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:02,160
And you just fight him from taking that
pen and stabbing it into his own eye

1947
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:06,420
because he just can't get somebody that
isn't smoking weed.

1948
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:11,490
Somebody that can pass a pt test,
somebody that can pass the tape test and

1949
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:13,620
then somebody that can passed was the
tape test.

1950
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,030
I'm like,
they're not.

1951
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:20,031
So we measure their neck and their waist
and they can't even pass that.

1952
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,250
So the two fat,
the two fat is the neck too little or

1953
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,440
too big?
Um,

1954
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,140
so if you have a big neck and a big
waste,

1955
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:30,870
this is um,
because like I have a big neck,

1956
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,130
right?
But it's from working out.

1957
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:34,260
Yeah.
But I have a tiny little waist so that

1958
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,650
gives me my bmi and my body fat.
They measure it.

1959
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:40,100
It's a pretty,
it's a gross measurement,

1960
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,330
height,
weight and measurement and the other.

1961
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,780
There's only like four things that we
need for some,

1962
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,850
for us to say.
And it's harder to get into the military

1963
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:49,230
than it is to get into college.
That's,

1964
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:50,640
that's absolutely true.

1965
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:52,510
Not Regular military,
but special forest.

1966
01:30:52,511 --> 01:30:54,400
So regular military wives.
Yeah.

1967
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:55,680
Really?
Yes.

1968
01:30:55,890 --> 01:31:00,890
It is not easy.
And then from that we only pick combat

1969
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:04,170
arms and then have that combined arms.
We only pick the top 100.

1970
01:31:04,171 --> 01:31:07,380
Is it harder for someone to get into the
military than it is to get into college?

1971
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:09,540
I thought it was fairly easy to get into
the military.

1972
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:13,080
I'm pretty sure anybody can go to
college.

1973
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:15,111
Anybody?
Well,

1974
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:17,040
you can go to community college.
That's college,

1975
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,210
right?
Yeah.

1976
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,940
Um,
I'm not saying that it says easy to get

1977
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:22,470
into Mit,
right?

1978
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,910
But anybody can go to any college that
they want,

1979
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,620
not any,
any college that can get in and they can

1980
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:33,330
go to
a local community college and then two

1981
01:31:33,331 --> 01:31:35,670
years there they can go and get into the
next unit,

1982
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,020
you know,
like the state school.

1983
01:31:37,021 --> 01:31:38,020
And then from there they can get a good.

1984
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,940
I mean anybody can do that.
Well you can't go to the military if you

1985
01:31:40,941 --> 01:31:43,620
smoke weed,
you can't go to the military if you have

1986
01:31:43,621 --> 01:31:45,240
bad eyes,
you can't go to the military.

1987
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:46,800
If you're diabetic,
you can't go into the military.

1988
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:47,850
If you have asthma,
you can't go.

1989
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,740
You can do,
you can go to college if you have all

1990
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:51,280
those things right,
you know you.

1991
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,390
You can't go into the military.
If your Iq is x number,

1992
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:56,580
depending on your job,
well you can still go to college.

1993
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,120
You can't go in the military if you
can't run a mile or two miles in this

1994
01:32:01,121 --> 01:32:03,490
speed and do this number of pushups in
this many sit ups.

1995
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,440
I don't think any college has that
requirement,

1996
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,960
so I'm just in those seven things alone.
We just,

1997
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:11,290
we just exed out 80 percent of our
population.

1998
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:12,880
And do you have.

1999
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:16,090
Is there also a problem with people's
attitude towards military

2000
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,480
with young people?
Yeah,

2001
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:20,700
a little bit,
but that,

2002
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:24,400
that that is mostly a physical issue.
That is way less of an issue.

2003
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:28,750
The perception of the military is way
less of an issue than us just having a

2004
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:31,840
qualified population of viable
candidates for us to pick from.

2005
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,200
I mean,
it's really bad where we're.

2006
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,880
We're freaking,
we're.

2007
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:39,100
We were borderline freaking out about
what we're going to do.

2008
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:44,550
So an average special force of Oda has
supposed to have 12 guys in it.

2009
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,440
Right?
Right.

2010
01:32:47,441 --> 01:32:50,770
Now you're not going to find a team that
has more than 10 and

2011
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,720
we only have 70 percent of our teams
with 10.

2012
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,900
Yeah.
Thank God we didn't go to war with North

2013
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,540
Korea.
They got at war ended and that we're not

2014
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:06,940
dropping nuclear bombs.
Anybody because we're in.

2015
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,920
We're in a hurt locker for qualified
people.

2016
01:33:09,921 --> 01:33:11,060
Have no idea about this.
No,

2017
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,490
it's scary.
Wow.

2018
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:19,410
So this is like part of the.
One of the best ways to measure what's

2019
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:20,970
wrong with the way people are living
today.

2020
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:23,430
Yeah.
I mean forget about whether or not they

2021
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,600
want to go and serve the,
the,

2022
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:31,530
the viable quality candidates like this.
A number of them that are even available

2023
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,620
is the lowest it's ever been.
Well,

2024
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,420
what about high school athletics?
I mean,

2025
01:33:38,421 --> 01:33:39,960
have they decreased?
Finished?

2026
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,300
Yeah.
Really at the same rate.

2027
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,580
The part very,
very similar.

2028
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,880
The participation in not.
So you can go and play for your,

2029
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,860
the rec time volleyball,
but to get onto the varsity football

2030
01:33:57,861 --> 01:34:00,770
team or the varsity volleyball team or
the varsity track team,

2031
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:03,590
the number of people in percentage to
the.

2032
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:08,450
So if you have a thousand people,
you had 100 of them that were picked to

2033
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:11,320
participate in those athletics.
Nice way.

2034
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,360
Ten percent.
That number now is down to like five or

2035
01:34:14,361 --> 01:34:16,250
six percent.
So the,

2036
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,630
the overall percentage per capita and
the number of people participating in

2037
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:25,610
these sports has been consistently
decreasing for the past 20 years.

2038
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:30,680
Twenty years in 20 years is essentially
when the Internet became a huge thing.

2039
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:34,640
I mean that's basically the same
timeline you're looking at like 94,

2040
01:34:34,641 --> 01:34:36,800
99.
You see obesity going like this,

2041
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:42,590
you've got bad food.
We got to.

2042
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:48,360
Our jobs are getting less and less
physical that the focus on what jobs

2043
01:34:48,591 --> 01:34:50,870
people should have.
Everybody's been like no,

2044
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,480
go to college and become an academic.

2045
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,570
So you can be this intellectual that can
go and do this job.

2046
01:34:56,571 --> 01:34:59,450
And then you graduate college with a
student loan and you have no job to go

2047
01:34:59,451 --> 01:35:00,380
to.
Um,

2048
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,050
where there's this guy that needs
welders,

2049
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:05,530
but it's not cool to be a welder,
so don't,

2050
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:09,740
don't do that or to be a mechanic like
all these trade jobs that are just

2051
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:13,910
begging and pleading for and they are
sometimes physical but they need people.

2052
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,690
But it's not core to do that because,
you know,

2053
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:18,240
like I want to go to,
we'll go to long beach state or I want

2054
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:23,250
to go to ucla or I want to go hang out
with a bunch of hot chicks.

2055
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:24,660
Lsu,
you know,

2056
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:28,310
it's,
the focus has been wrong for awhile and

2057
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:31,100
uh,
and that is evident in special forces

2058
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:33,050
selection when we don't have anybody to
pick from,

2059
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,630
we can't select,
wow,

2060
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,030
why don't we hear about this?

2061
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:44,060
Is this something that I'm trying to
keep hush hush or it has been a problem

2062
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:49,330
because our community motto is the quiet
professionals.

2063
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,560
That's our motto.
How do you fit into that?

2064
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,423
Yeah,
I don't.

2065
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:00,650
I mean I get so much crap all the time,
but thank God like guys that really

2066
01:36:00,651 --> 01:36:05,180
understand what I'm trying to do.
They realize I don't shut up because I'm

2067
01:36:05,181 --> 01:36:08,870
trying to help the regiment.
I'm trying the best ways that I can,

2068
01:36:08,871 --> 01:36:11,720
the best ways that we can figure out
with people way smarter than me helping

2069
01:36:11,721 --> 01:36:15,410
me know I was on the phone yesterday
with some of the best and brightest in

2070
01:36:15,411 --> 01:36:18,320
the special operations recruiting
battalion about how were we going to fix

2071
01:36:18,321 --> 01:36:19,190
this?
How are we going to market,

2072
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:22,910
how are we going to develop interest?
And um,

2073
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:25,520
so thankfully they're smarter than me,
um,

2074
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,650
but we were almost

2075
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:33,290
screwing ourselves over because that is
what,

2076
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:36,250
how we live and that's how we do our
job.

2077
01:36:36,251 --> 01:36:38,170
If you read about us on the news,
we failed.

2078
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,690
You know,
if you read about army special forces

2079
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,780
doing something,
we may,

2080
01:36:42,781 --> 01:36:44,800
we have done messed up,
you know,

2081
01:36:44,801 --> 01:36:47,140
this is not the navy seals.
We're not writing books,

2082
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:49,270
you know,
we're not talking about our exploits.

2083
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:50,800
We didn't kill bin Ladin.
Um,

2084
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:54,760
this is us just doing our work and
nobody's supposed to know about it.

2085
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,580
But because of that,
we now have a huge recruiting problem.

2086
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:01,630
What is the,
what's the approach to try to balance

2087
01:37:01,631 --> 01:37:03,640
that out?
Is there any strategies in play?

2088
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:05,350
Yeah,
we talked through a bunch.

2089
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,690
Um,
we're trying to figure out,

2090
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:09,410
uh,
you know,

2091
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,263
I think

2092
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:15,450
just getting the word out,
letting people know,

2093
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:19,080
one,
we have to get that population healthy.

2094
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:23,640
So let's,
let's go specifically after athletes.

2095
01:37:23,641 --> 01:37:26,220
Let's,
let's go to a high school wrestling room

2096
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:28,560
and be like,
hey fellas like this.

2097
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:31,620
That's where I heard about it when I
first heard about army special forces

2098
01:37:31,621 --> 01:37:36,621
was a guy in a really bad cut suit from
probably like JC penny's or macy's

2099
01:37:36,631 --> 01:37:37,231
walked in,
you know,

2100
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:38,310
and he's like,
hey guys,

2101
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,770
you ever thought about army special
forces?

2102
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,050
And I was like,
I don't even know what that is.

2103
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,380
I like the navy seals.
He's like,

2104
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:44,341
yeah,
check it out.

2105
01:37:44,341 --> 01:37:47,280
And he gave us this crappy car and
walked away and I never saw him again.

2106
01:37:47,281 --> 01:37:48,950
But that planted that seed,
you know?

2107
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:50,460
And then nine slash 11 happens.
I was like,

2108
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:53,490
I know where I'm going to go into that
dude that had that bad suit.

2109
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:58,660
I'm gonna Find Him Gore for that guy.
So just we're talking about my show hard

2110
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:00,930
to kill.
Um,

2111
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,780
you know,
it's not just army special forces,

2112
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:07,770
it's marine recon,
it's the navy seals,

2113
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:10,800
it's air force,
PJ's every special operations that has a

2114
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:14,190
selection process.
They don't have a population to pick

2115
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:16,170
from.
They don't have that body,

2116
01:38:16,171 --> 01:38:19,320
that pool of qualified applicants to
select from.

2117
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:24,000
So everybody is having the same problem.
So let's,

2118
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:28,020
let's do the top gun thing.
Let's show how cool it is to be an

2119
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:30,030
aviator.
Another job that we don't have enough

2120
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,340
guys,
if we don't have enough pilots.

2121
01:38:31,341 --> 01:38:36,341
So was this the motivation behind hard
to kill part of it to get me.

2122
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,940
And the reason why I was allowed to do
it,

2123
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,670
like we're going to have an episode
every single season where I'm going to

2124
01:38:41,671 --> 01:38:46,671
highlight some crazy bad ass military
job doing things that way.

2125
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,580
You're going to jump off a Zodiac a mile
from water,

2126
01:38:50,581 --> 01:38:54,450
you're going to swim in to walk for
miles with a rucksack to them.

2127
01:38:54,451 --> 01:38:59,000
Go do a raid on a bomb makers house
hanging off the side of a players with a

2128
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:00,440
machine gun,
you know,

2129
01:39:00,441 --> 01:39:02,820
so just like freaking awesome.
But this is the job.

2130
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:06,990
So let's show them what this job is,
let's show them how hard it is because

2131
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:09,690
it's hard.
This is not easy stuff that these guys

2132
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:14,490
do and hopefully somebody will be
inspired and somebody would be like,

2133
01:39:14,491 --> 01:39:15,031
all right,
I'm gonna.

2134
01:39:15,031 --> 01:39:16,100
Get off the couch.
So what,

2135
01:39:16,101 --> 01:39:18,810
what is hard to kill?
Because I've heard of it,

2136
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:20,940
I've heard the name,
but I really haven't looked into it.

2137
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,730
I've tried.
So I tried so hard to get discovery

2138
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:27,480
channel to let you show the first bit of
it.

2139
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,160
They won't.
Why not?

2140
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:29,780
I don't see.

2141
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:31,140
They said it's a hurt.
Something.

2142
01:39:31,141 --> 01:39:32,610
It's a rough.
It's a rough cut.

2143
01:39:32,611 --> 01:39:34,530
And they want everything perfect.
Okay.

2144
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,150
Well when they get it perfect,
send it to me.

2145
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:40,620
We'll play it.
So we find a job that is inherently

2146
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:45,621
dangerous that people die and doing and
is necessary for our way of life.

2147
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,260
That's the first part.
We find whatever that is that um,

2148
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:55,020
that might be a guy that changes light
bulbs at the top of Cell Towers.

2149
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:57,140
That might be somebody that's hanging
off the side of a building,

2150
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:59,730
Washington windows.
That might be an experimental test

2151
01:39:59,731 --> 01:40:02,220
pilot.
That might be somebody that works on a

2152
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:04,230
bull ranch,
um,

2153
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:08,790
it might be a guy that delivering
antibiotics in Alaska to families that

2154
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:11,700
live out in the bush.
So it's not necessarily military jobs

2155
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:13,710
now we'll,
it's jobs in general.

2156
01:40:13,711 --> 01:40:13,891
No,
no,

2157
01:40:13,891 --> 01:40:14,580
no,
no.

2158
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:18,090
I think we only do one military job in
this first season.

2159
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:18,861
I thought,
oh,

2160
01:40:18,861 --> 01:40:20,580
okay.
Because I have a very distorted

2161
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:23,040
perception of it.
I thought hard to kill was all about

2162
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:24,090
military.
Nope,

2163
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:25,380
just one.
It's,

2164
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:30,440
it's anybody anywhere that does
something necessary for our way of life

2165
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:34,830
and they die doing their job.
That's,

2166
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:36,750
that's the show.
And I'm trying to highlight and I'm

2167
01:40:36,751 --> 01:40:40,080
trying to pay homage and respect to
these people that nobody thinks about or

2168
01:40:40,081 --> 01:40:41,700
appreciates,
you know,

2169
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:44,250
like let's walk on our southwest flight
and we're like,

2170
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:45,084
Hey,
uh,

2171
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,730
can I get my beverage service and my
peanuts man.

2172
01:40:47,731 --> 01:40:50,820
But in the fifties and sixties,
the average life expectancy of an

2173
01:40:50,821 --> 01:40:52,980
experimental test pilot was like four
years.

2174
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,800
You know,
you have stories that these sr 71 pilots

2175
01:40:57,010 --> 01:41:00,340
that are flying at mach two and the
whole entire thing just disintegrates

2176
01:41:00,341 --> 01:41:02,500
around them.
One of the guys has killed instantly,

2177
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,910
the other guy starts falling.

2178
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,170
I think there's like 30,000 feet in the
air strapped to his chair.

2179
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:11,650
So we can't even use this parachute.
He wakes up,

2180
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:13,690
he's blacked out.
He can't look at it as visor because his

2181
01:41:13,691 --> 01:41:17,950
visors frozen and he just did a deadspin
fallen at 200 miles an hour at any

2182
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:19,340
lives.
How?

2183
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:21,790
Because he's amazing.
So let's,

2184
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:22,840
let's,
how did he live?

2185
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:26,280
Well,
I recreate that whole entire thing in

2186
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,690
the show.
Did that.

2187
01:41:27,691 --> 01:41:30,130
I'm full stupid.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2188
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,480
I'm done man.
You did that?

2189
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:36,160
Yeah,
I'll come over there.

2190
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:39,760
It's very tense.
How did this guy survive?

2191
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,870
So he wakes up,
um,

2192
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,330
he,
he's in a free fall.

2193
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:46,750
He strapped to his chair.
His parachute won't deploy his visors

2194
01:41:46,751 --> 01:41:48,440
frozen.
Um,

2195
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:53,700
he gets his harness off and then he goes
into the box which is free fall

2196
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:55,870
position,
which kind of stabilizes.

2197
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,720
Super impressive that he knew how to do
that in the first place.

2198
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,660
A lot of pilots never even practiced
free fall.

2199
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:04,660
So He's free falling.
And first,

2200
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:09,010
let's remember,
this guy was a combat pilot in Vietnam

2201
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,470
and in Korea.
So,

2202
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:11,761
um,
this,

2203
01:42:11,761 --> 01:42:14,230
this guy has been,
he's actually been shot down before,

2204
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:18,040
so pretty heroic fella and he gets out
of his harness,

2205
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:20,860
he's in the box,
he deploys his parachute in the box

2206
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:22,300
again.
How do you do it?

2207
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,050
You're,
you're,

2208
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:26,200
you're pretty much driving your hips
down as a massive sprawl.

2209
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:27,790
Okay?
That's what it is.

2210
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,920
It looks like you're driving your hips
down to massive sprawl.

2211
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:34,450
Your arms are pushed back,
so air is evenly flowing off of your

2212
01:42:34,451 --> 01:42:36,550
body from spinning.
It makes you stable.

2213
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:39,790
So the air,
the friction of the air off of your body

2214
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:43,750
makes you stop spinning in circles or
tumbling overhead.

2215
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,140
And he,
because of his,

2216
01:42:46,141 --> 01:42:49,240
um,
center sat parachute,

2217
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:52,810
he naturally had weight on his hips,
which dropped his hips down.

2218
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:57,760
And then he just kind of stabilized,
coincidentally through his parachute and

2219
01:42:57,761 --> 01:43:00,130
the lat landed on his records,
which was on fire.

2220
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:02,260
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

2221
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,350
Which we recreated for me too.
I got burnt pretty jacked up.

2222
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:08,080
They put me inside of a experimental
test plane,

2223
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:11,320
put aviation fluid on it,
locked the cabinets,

2224
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:15,220
are locked the cockpit,
and then set it on fire with me inside

2225
01:43:15,221 --> 01:43:17,530
of it.
Why do you do this?

2226
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:23,110
Because that's not even like real,
like you're choosing to do this.

2227
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:25,450
Yeah.
But they did it.

2228
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:30,430
They did it and they survived.
And you're doing it to recreate it in

2229
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:32,080
their honor.
What we have,

2230
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:33,630
I mean,
there are there,

2231
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:38,230
there are safety measures in place where
like I only got,

2232
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:40,990
Kinda got burned so my shirt got melted
in my.

2233
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:43,420
I was able to get out of my seat belt
because my seatbelt melted.

2234
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:46,000
Um,
but I thought out because it melted.

2235
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,020
Yeah.
Oh fuck.

2236
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:49,480
And then I was able to,
I couldn't get the cockpit open because

2237
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:50,920
the cockpit held.
Mel had melted,

2238
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:54,620
so I just tore the cockpit open.
Um,

2239
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:59,860
but we are maybe one or two seconds away
from the fire department just descending

2240
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:04,580
upon me to,
to save my life and then take me to the

2241
01:44:04,581 --> 01:44:09,581
hospital.
So the motivation is everybody I think

2242
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:15,520
takes for granted all of the things that
we have in our life and there are some

2243
01:44:15,561 --> 01:44:20,300
pretty heroic,
courageous people that risk at every

2244
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:22,220
single day to do these jobs,
to get our food,

2245
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,820
to get our oil.
Like that stuff is pumped from the

2246
01:44:25,821 --> 01:44:28,460
center of the ocean.
Sometimes know there's a guy diving

2247
01:44:28,461 --> 01:44:32,180
down,
breathing helium and nitrogen at a few

2248
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:36,470
hundred feet,
messing with gases that if he cuts just

2249
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:39,830
one millimeter to deep,
he's going to get sucked into the pipe

2250
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:43,670
because the negative pressure,
you know guys that are flying a plane,

2251
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:46,790
there's no test dummy for flying a
plane,

2252
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:47,983
right?

2253
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:51,110
Some dude is going to sit inside of a
plane sometime and be like,

2254
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,830
let's say fuck it.
Let's see if this works.

2255
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,230
Yeah.
Think about the whole thing on that too.

2256
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:59,330
A lot.
So that's the whole point was we wanted

2257
01:44:59,331 --> 01:45:03,440
to show and there's hundreds and
hundreds of people that do these jobs

2258
01:45:03,441 --> 01:45:06,920
that we just don't think about in the
middle of a hurricane.

2259
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:11,600
Like how has your power still on.
There's somebody out there trying to fix

2260
01:45:11,601 --> 01:45:12,530
it.
You're,

2261
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:16,550
you're in the middle of a blizzard and
just feet and feet of snow or descending

2262
01:45:16,551 --> 01:45:17,720
on.
There's power lines and you think

2263
01:45:17,721 --> 01:45:18,710
they're just staying up there?
No,

2264
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:20,510
man.
There's somebody hanging off the side of

2265
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:25,340
that tower that's negative 20 outside
and he's trying to fix that stuff.

2266
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:27,320
So you.
So your heater stays on so you don't

2267
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:29,600
freeze.
Are you going to get one of those planes

2268
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:30,830
that flies into hurricanes?

2269
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,090
Yeah,
man,

2270
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:36,620
we do the dumbest stuff.
Are you going to do that?

2271
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:37,760
Yeah.
You are?

2272
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:39,930
Yeah.
How about putting me at the bottom of a,

2273
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,140
of a mountain and setting off an
avalanche?

2274
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:43,791
What?
Yeah,

2275
01:45:43,791 --> 01:45:44,780
let's do that.
Take it.

2276
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,820
Are you going to do that or are we.
Did that?

2277
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:48,140
Oh Dude,
don't die.

2278
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:49,600
Don't die.
Am I like you?

2279
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:54,110
An [inaudible] to helicopter and the
Arctic Ocean and go and crash it into

2280
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:58,460
the ocean and then make me swim to an
iceberg and live on the iceberg.

2281
01:45:58,520 --> 01:45:59,360
Did you do that?
Yeah,

2282
01:45:59,361 --> 01:46:02,460
I did that because somebody else did on
the iceberg for I was too,

2283
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,320
too cold account.
Um,

2284
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:06,020
what I had to do once I got to the
iceberg,

2285
01:46:06,021 --> 01:46:09,290
I had to get my,
I had like these tasks that I had to do

2286
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:12,350
for them to come and get me.
So once the helicopter went underwater

2287
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:16,250
and I had to swim down into the
helicopter and the water was 33 degrees

2288
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:17,690
and then I just swam,
I think it was about,

2289
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,810
um,
a few hundred meters and it's 33 degree

2290
01:46:20,811 --> 01:46:24,590
water is about 30 minutes total time in
this 33 degree water.

2291
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:27,890
I fortunately was able to bounce some
ideas off of Calkins,

2292
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:31,850
Berrien and uh,
went hoff and a bunch of guys from on it

2293
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:33,710
because they,
they're pretty into that cold weather

2294
01:46:33,711 --> 01:46:34,544
stuff.
Cold.

2295
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:38,240
What did that mean?
What does kyle know about swimming in

2296
01:46:38,241 --> 01:46:39,950
the ocean?
He doesn't three degrees.

2297
01:46:39,951 --> 01:46:42,620
He knows about the extreme temperature.
Um,

2298
01:46:42,621 --> 01:46:45,250
he,
he does the contrast showers and like

2299
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,560
the heart rate breathing.
And so I was just trying.

2300
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:52,350
I experimented a bunch of it before I
went and did the episode to make sure I

2301
01:46:52,351 --> 01:46:54,690
didn't die.
How much time can you spend in that

2302
01:46:54,691 --> 01:46:56,340
water?
I thought it was only like a few

2303
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,173
minutes.
That's what they said.

2304
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:59,190
Um,
and uh,

2305
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,920
I wonder were in there for 30 years.
I want to see how long I could do it.

2306
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,910
Um,
so once I lost small motor function so I

2307
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:07,650
couldn't move my hands,
um,

2308
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:08,640
I could still swim.

2309
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:13,700
So then once I could have my arms went
next but I could still kind of do the

2310
01:47:13,951 --> 01:47:18,270
eggbeater kick from swimming and water
polo and that lasted about another eight

2311
01:47:18,271 --> 01:47:22,200
or nine minutes and then it was Kinda
like I was just trying to keep my head

2312
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:23,710
above water.
Um,

2313
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:26,490
and then they sent him the rescue diver
and pulled me out.

2314
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Fuck Dude.
Took me four hours to get moving to,

2315
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:37,210
to be able to move again for hours.
They can't,

2316
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,710
they can't warm you back up either.
So they,

2317
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:43,440
like they put you in a sleeping bag but
no heater and no,

2318
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:47,310
you have to very slowly because you can
go into shock if you warm up too fast.

2319
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:48,600
Oh,
Jesus.

2320
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:49,503
Yeah.
It's,

2321
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,240
man.
I should have,

2322
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:53,253
should've been a golfer.

2323
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:58,470
It wouldn't have worked.
Tiger Woods is surging again,

2324
01:47:58,530 --> 01:47:59,280
you know,
like,

2325
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,780
yeah,
what the heck.

2326
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,670
But yeah,
you would have got bored.

2327
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:08,340
So there's um,
a Bush pilot and Alaskan Bush pilot

2328
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:09,670
that,
you know,

2329
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:13,050
they like deliver food to these people
living out in the middle of nowhere in

2330
01:48:13,051 --> 01:48:18,051
Alaska and he's flying to
an engine stops.

2331
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:19,410
He's like,
oh,

2332
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:21,930
that sucks.
So it auto rotation is,

2333
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:25,860
they still have a little bit of lift
from just the friction of the blades so

2334
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:30,750
they kind of can control because the
blades are still kind of like rutgers.

2335
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:35,040
So you're talking about a helicopter
helicopter so they can somewhat control

2336
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:38,370
their descent.
So he finds an iceberg and he's like,

2337
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:40,470
oh,
I'll go crash by that iceberg.

2338
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:45,180
So it goes and crashes by the ass near
the iceberg and the helicopter

2339
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:47,550
submerging.
And he dives into this emerging

2340
01:48:47,551 --> 01:48:49,470
helicopter to get his survival
equipment.

2341
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:54,890
And then he swims over to the iceberg
and he sets his kinda like shelter up

2342
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,900
and then he has to fight off polar bears
for a couple of days.

2343
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:01,080
He lifts this,
this dude survives.

2344
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:02,610
And he,
he was like,

2345
01:49:02,611 --> 01:49:06,870
the source for our Bush pilot episode
was this one guy,

2346
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:10,950
but there's hundreds and hundreds of
stories of these guys crashing all the

2347
01:49:10,951 --> 01:49:14,520
time.
So we just try to figure out what the

2348
01:49:14,521 --> 01:49:16,560
job is,
why it's hard,

2349
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:19,050
why it's dangerous.
And then what is the worst case

2350
01:49:19,051 --> 01:49:21,000
scenario,
what is the worst day on the job?

2351
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,180
And let's see what that's like.
How do you find off the polar bears?

2352
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:25,471
Um,
so he,

2353
01:49:25,471 --> 01:49:28,230
he,
he had a raft like the,

2354
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:30,960
his flotation raft,
and it was an inverted,

2355
01:49:30,961 --> 01:49:34,560
which he had turned into like a small
Igloo and he could hear the bears

2356
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:38,450
starting to come up to.
And it doesn't get dark there.

2357
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:41,790
It depends on the time of the year.
Suddenly had like one or two hours of

2358
01:49:41,791 --> 01:49:42,860
darkness.
Um,

2359
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,540
so we could still kind of see and he
could see the bears coming.

2360
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:48,730
So he was sitting inside that just
hoarding super still and they could just

2361
01:49:48,731 --> 01:49:51,820
smell that something was off.
They're trying to figure out what it was

2362
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:56,900
and then it would stand up with his raft
on his shoulders and back were banging

2363
01:49:57,401 --> 01:49:59,740
on the big plastic you rafting and this,
you know,

2364
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:03,910
they could figure out what it was
because it was just 12 by 12 raft rising

2365
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:07,180
and running with them and with lots of
noise and that's.

2366
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:10,420
And he was able to scare them away I
think three times before you finally

2367
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:11,890
rescued.
Oh my God.

2368
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,210
No weapons,
no weapons.

2369
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,100
Oh,
fucking Christ.

2370
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:17,700
Yep.
Ooh,

2371
01:50:17,770 --> 01:50:20,130
I don't have those balls.
Well,

2372
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,080
you would if you were there.
You do whatever you had to do if you

2373
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,020
were there.
Polar bears scare me.

2374
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,750
They scare the shit out of me because
they actively hunt us.

2375
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:30,370
Oh yeah.
The one of the few animals.

2376
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,050
I mean,
that's all they do is eat meat.

2377
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,050
Anything that moves largest car on a
more on the planet.

2378
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,600
Yeah.
Do you ever see that video where they

2379
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:41,620
took a guy from BBC and they put them in
a big giant glass box,

2380
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:46,240
like a plexiglass box and put them out
into the Arctic and polar bear came up,

2381
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:48,460
was trying to bite through the box and
figure out how to get him.

2382
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,420
So he's inside the box filming it and
this thing could smell them and it's

2383
01:50:52,421 --> 01:50:54,790
just opening its mouth is as big as this
fucking.

2384
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:59,200
That's when you really get a perspective
of how large they are and it's trying to

2385
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,270
bite into this box.
Here it is.

2386
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:03,990
Here's the guy.
So the thing comes up to him.

2387
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:05,830
I mean we're.
Hey,

2388
01:51:05,831 --> 01:51:09,040
this is the Klondike bar thing.
This is the Guy Likes Coca Cola.

2389
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:12,490
No.
So giant Super Predator and it's trying

2390
01:51:12,491 --> 01:51:14,600
to figure out how to get smart too.
Yeah,

2391
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:17,230
well they have to be.
So he's got this.

2392
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:19,480
I would've checked that lock like
$50,000.

2393
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,500
I don't understand this box trying from
all angles.

2394
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:24,870
Look how big that is.

2395
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:31,180
That box would have smelled like shit
for me if I were in there right now.

2396
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:33,360
That's all you could smell in that box.
Yeah,

2397
01:51:33,361 --> 01:51:37,180
man.
It's such a strange task.

2398
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:38,051
I mean,
I don't know.

2399
01:51:38,051 --> 01:51:39,610
There's a boat behind him,
I guess.

2400
01:51:39,611 --> 01:51:43,330
So the dude with me with a tranquilizer.
Hopefully.

2401
01:51:43,331 --> 01:51:44,950
Rifle.
Yeah.

2402
01:51:45,310 --> 01:51:46,690
Look at that.
Oh my God.

2403
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,130
It's trying to figure out how to get
them.

2404
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,670
It's a,
it's a very disturbing video.

2405
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:55,990
And it went on for a little while.
The thing left and came back and left

2406
01:51:55,991 --> 01:51:58,270
and came back again and finally they got
him out of there.

2407
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:01,160
Fuck that.
It's amazing.

2408
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:02,890
It's crazy animal.
Yeah.

2409
01:52:02,891 --> 01:52:05,680
We couldn't find a polar bears.
Did you want to?

2410
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:08,320
I did.
I'm always going to try to scare them

2411
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:09,154
off that way.
Yeah.

2412
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:13,090
I'm kinda ended really badly.
But another poor decision in Tim's life,

2413
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:15,040
uh,
the,

2414
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:20,750
the discovery channel,
this is the most expensive insured show

2415
01:52:20,751 --> 01:52:22,220
they've ever done,
I would imagine.

2416
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:25,100
And um,
they're just some things

2417
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,150
we,
we,

2418
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:32,750
we know shit took explosives,
tnt through them from the side of the

2419
01:52:32,751 --> 01:52:34,850
helicopter to cause avalanches

2420
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,240
that I'm,
that I'm in.

2421
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,920
And so do you have one of those
inflatable suits?

2422
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:43,740
It keeps you from getting completely
compressed?

2423
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:45,060
Yeah,
we tried that one time

2424
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:49,550
that I definitely use that and I think
that saved me one time.

2425
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:52,220
It kept me up on top.
So those things don't keep you from

2426
01:52:52,221 --> 01:52:53,900
being compressed.
It keeps you on top.

2427
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:58,790
It's like a flotation device,
a life preserver for the snow,

2428
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,960
so it gives you more surface area of
friction which rises you to be like when

2429
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:05,390
you have a big jar of pebbles and you
shake them,

2430
01:53:05,391 --> 01:53:08,330
the biggest ones go to the top.
That's all that's happening is you're

2431
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:12,110
trying to make yourself the biggest
pebble to raise you to the top of this

2432
01:53:12,111 --> 01:53:15,470
huge friction.
So because most people,

2433
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:19,610
they actually die of traumatic injuries
during the avalanche,

2434
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:22,220
not from a fixation.
Really.

2435
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:25,490
Uh,
even though when they finally put me in

2436
01:53:25,491 --> 01:53:26,860
the avalanche,
I was low.

2437
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:31,940
I was inside of the snow for 30 minutes.
That was the amount of time that the

2438
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:34,670
network would let us,
would let me see if I could survive.

2439
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:35,750
And I had a,
I had a,

2440
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:38,540
a button,
if I clicked it every minute on the

2441
01:53:38,541 --> 01:53:40,820
bottom of the minute,
they would leave me in there for another

2442
01:53:40,821 --> 01:53:44,000
minute.
So I stayed in for 29,

2443
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:46,850
59 and so as soon as it's over 30 they
were like,

2444
01:53:46,851 --> 01:53:48,500
that's it.
That's all the time we allow.

2445
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,640
Yep.
Wow.

2446
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:51,710
What was it like in there for really
cold?

2447
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,420
Yeah,
it was super cold.

2448
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:56,540
It was dark.
It was hard to figure out which way was

2449
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:58,250
up.
Um,

2450
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:02,180
so I figured out which way was up
because I was able to,

2451
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:05,780
like I took my snowboard and goggles and
I put them over my mouth.

2452
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:09,680
So the snow went side initially have a
little bit of um,

2453
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:14,810
a few breaths of air because what
happens is you get a ice seal around

2454
01:54:14,811 --> 01:54:18,710
your face from you exhaling,
melting,

2455
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:23,540
it freezes.
So then you have this cocoon of no fresh

2456
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:24,374
air coming in.

2457
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:25,693
So,
um,

2458
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:28,460
I was able to.
So I locked my hand inside of my helmet

2459
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:32,090
and I held my goggles over my mouth so I
would have a little bit of air.

2460
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:35,570
So then I was able to take that off and
get it over my son and I have a little

2461
01:54:35,571 --> 01:54:40,571
bit of air here and that was like moving
snow with my pinned hand too.

2462
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:46,060
But then I saw a drip of water drip off
of my glasses at a 45 degree angle to my

2463
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:47,114
left.
I was like,

2464
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:48,890
oh,
up is that way.

2465
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,810
That was.
That was like the best thing for my

2466
01:54:50,811 --> 01:54:54,240
brain to know which way up was because
that was the only way you could tell was

2467
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:56,180
because you just your waiting list and
snow.

2468
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,340
Wow.
That's a crazy feeling.

2469
01:54:58,341 --> 01:55:00,320
Like you don't know where the up is.
Yeah.

2470
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:02,570
So up could be your feet.

2471
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:04,550
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2472
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:09,710
And you wouldn't even know.
So I just gravity watching that drop of

2473
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:14,711
water drip off of my snow goggles as a
Qa piece for my brain.

2474
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:16,940
What if it went up?
I would've,

2475
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:20,570
I would've pissed myself.
What have you spit and you go up,

2476
01:55:20,571 --> 01:55:21,560
you're like,
oh no,

2477
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:25,000
oh no,
I got to go with that date.

2478
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:28,250
And there's no moving.
Either get rescued or you freeze to

2479
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:29,061
death.
And so there's.

2480
01:55:29,061 --> 01:55:32,690
This is not a controlled avalanche.
They're just actually starting an

2481
01:55:32,691 --> 01:55:33,524
avalanche.
Yep.

2482
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36,440
How many of these episodes are you
planning on doing,

2483
01:55:36,441 --> 01:55:37,520
Tim?
I mean,

2484
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:39,860
can we stop now?
Nah,

2485
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:43,530
I think we've got a bunch of people that
the world needs to know about that,

2486
01:55:43,531 --> 01:55:45,510
uh,
that we take for granted how we get our

2487
01:55:45,511 --> 01:55:46,610
food,
how we get our gas,

2488
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,500
how we get our.
And uh,

2489
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:53,660
I think I got a bunch of special forces
recruiting slots I need to fill and this

2490
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:54,534
is the way to do it.

2491
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,490
I hope cells killing yourself every
week.

2492
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:58,320
I didn't.
I mean I went,

2493
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:00,870
oh,
I almost only died three times in this,

2494
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:04,040
in this first season.
Um,

2495
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:09,840
and if somebody is like,
that's a cool job or weight,

2496
01:56:09,841 --> 01:56:11,040
the only way that Tim,
I'm there,

2497
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:14,550
there are some times where you're
watching me inside of a cockpit that's

2498
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:17,040
on fire.
And the only way I got out is because

2499
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,830
I'm a savage.
Like I'm just a beast.

2500
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,501
I was like,
I'm not,

2501
01:56:20,501 --> 01:56:22,260
I don't feel like getting burned alive
today.

2502
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:26,180
So I tear the cockpit open.
I think somebody at some point it's

2503
01:56:26,181 --> 01:56:30,030
going to draw the conclusion that I was
able to do that because of physicality

2504
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:32,460
that if you're a fat person sitting
inside of there,

2505
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:36,750
you would be burnt alive.
And maybe they'd get off their couch and

2506
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:38,370
they go and do something.
Maybe they,

2507
01:56:38,371 --> 01:56:40,290
uh,
there's a weird way to motivate people

2508
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,780
want anyways.

2509
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:43,710
A good way.
I'll take it.

2510
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:46,590
I don't know whose idea was this for
this show?

2511
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:48,090
That was my idea.
Jesus Christ.

2512
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:50,850
Dude,
you're an unusual human.

2513
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,150
It's fun though.
And how many of these episodes have you

2514
01:56:54,151 --> 01:56:56,010
done?
We have finished six.

2515
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:59,400
And you're going to that.
Is that the entire season?

2516
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,271
Yeah,
that'll be seasoned.

2517
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:03,360
One comes out in July.
You excited about it?

2518
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:04,590
Yeah,
I'm pumped.

2519
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:06,960
So 50 percent of the time you almost
died.

2520
01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:09,900
Yeah,
I mean that's gross math.

2521
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:12,510
Rounding around.
Okay.

2522
01:57:12,511 --> 01:57:15,450
So there's the water one.
Well you almost froze to death.

2523
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,530
Yep.
That definitely.

2524
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:20,880
And then the avalanche one way you
lasted 30 minutes.

2525
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:22,890
What was the other one?
Oh Man.

2526
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:24,430
Oh Man.
Yeah.

2527
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,400
Worse.
Yeah.

2528
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:26,243
I mean it was,
it was,

2529
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,280
it was less pleasant.
I'm like,

2530
01:57:30,670 --> 01:57:33,030
I was a bull fighter for an episode.
Oh Dude.

2531
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,750
And not a bull rider because they're
insane.

2532
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:38,790
But the bull fighter is the guy that's
on the ground.

2533
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:43,170
So when the bull fighter gets thrown,
he's the bodyguard for the bull rider.

2534
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,920
His only job is to take the hit.
So the bowl writer doesn't get trampled

2535
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:52,860
to death because the moment the bull
rider comes off the Bulls back,

2536
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:57,720
the bowl is turning around to crush
whatever was on his back and that's

2537
01:57:57,721 --> 01:57:59,280
where the bullfighter runs into save
him.

2538
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:01,020
And uh,
you know,

2539
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:02,940
the PBR,
the professional bull riders

2540
01:58:02,941 --> 01:58:04,140
association,
um,

2541
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:09,770
those guys are the most selfless,
courageous guys trying to protect those

2542
01:58:10,681 --> 01:58:12,250
bullfighters,
um,

2543
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:17,370
bull riders.
So I trained for a while and I was,

2544
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:22,820
went to the biggest rodeo in the nation
and was bullfighter and um,

2545
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:26,970
I mean this isn't one of those shows
where people don't get hurt,

2546
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:31,890
like you see the inside of my body.
You see people get really,

2547
01:58:31,891 --> 01:58:34,080
really,
really jacked up and go to the hospital

2548
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,040
and like it does.

2549
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,050
You have a punctured lung.
Is that guy going to live?

2550
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:42,250
This is that type of show because
there's no other way to do it.

2551
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:44,500
The only thing,
the only direction we had from discovery

2552
01:58:44,501 --> 01:58:48,360
was don't fake anything.
That's a great direction.

2553
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:50,080
That's great direction.
The glad they came up with that.

2554
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,720
Now what happened with the bull?
Um,

2555
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,690
I got owned,
which is humiliating because they're not

2556
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:03,250
really smart animals.
You're fast over there.

2557
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,350
Jamie's a wizard.
Yeah.

2558
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:08,950
To encourage all little boys and girls
that follow me on any social media

2559
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:11,260
platform to stay in school,
become engineers,

2560
01:59:11,261 --> 01:59:12,820
architects,
accountants,

2561
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:16,720
or anything that doesn't lead to
permanent brain damage or need of an

2562
01:59:16,721 --> 01:59:21,721
orthopedic surgeon.
It's you legs up at a bowl watching you

2563
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:27,250
through the air.
That was the training week.

2564
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:31,690
So this was when you were trying to
distract the bull.

2565
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:37,030
What kind of techniques do you use a
football running back stuff.

2566
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:39,340
Just Joo Kim.
Um,

2567
01:59:39,710 --> 01:59:42,610
the,
the thing is you actually have to sell

2568
01:59:42,611 --> 01:59:45,470
that body movement.
So like your weight,

2569
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:50,140
your weight has to shift far enough
where the bowl is going to really

2570
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:52,090
believe that you're going to go to that
direction.

2571
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:57,330
Um,
I wish bowls were so I wish they're

2572
01:59:57,340 --> 01:59:58,990
dumber than they are because they're
not.

2573
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:01,660
Because if you fake them once one
direction,

2574
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:04,630
they won't take it the next time
they'll,

2575
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:07,870
they'll you try to fake to the right.
They'll already start going right into

2576
02:00:07,871 --> 02:00:08,950
left,
so then you flick to the right,

2577
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:10,810
you go back to the left and you're like,
oh no,

2578
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:14,800
I have done an.
It's at that moment that tim realized he

2579
02:00:14,801 --> 02:00:16,250
had fucked up,
you know,

2580
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:17,890
then it just gets own.
I got destroyed.

2581
02:00:19,570 --> 02:00:21,670
And so when you get launched into the
air by a bull,

2582
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:22,870
it's,
it's,

2583
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:24,640
it's weird,
um,

2584
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,770
because it's,
it's weightless,

2585
02:00:26,830 --> 02:00:30,160
you know,
it's just a second and you are

2586
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:31,960
completely inverted.

2587
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:36,820
No control over where your body is going
because you didn't generate the energy.

2588
02:00:37,070 --> 02:00:39,610
Um,
but the other part of you,

2589
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:43,300
the other part of your brain is knowing
that that bowl is going to try to turn

2590
02:00:43,301 --> 02:00:48,010
as fast as it can and get you when you
land on the ground because that's what

2591
02:00:48,011 --> 02:00:51,190
it's really good is when you're down.
Yeah.

2592
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:57,100
So you're trying to keep track of where
this bowl is while you're hurling

2593
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:57,971
through the air.
Like,

2594
02:00:57,971 --> 02:00:59,680
okay,
I've got to Tuck my chin so I don't

2595
02:00:59,681 --> 02:01:01,240
break my neck,
you know,

2596
02:01:01,241 --> 02:01:02,860
hopefully I'm not close enough to the
fence.

2597
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:04,570
[inaudible] the fence doesn't move.
The fences,

2598
02:01:04,571 --> 02:01:05,470
metal,
you know,

2599
02:01:05,471 --> 02:01:08,200
the ground is pretty soft.
I'd rather land on the ground then

2600
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:11,200
landed on the fence.
The fence will mess you up.

2601
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,620
Anyways.
So that's that up.

2602
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:19,090
And how'd you get away from the bull?
I'm an athlete.

2603
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:22,020
I'm not sure if you know that.
That's it.

2604
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:24,670
That's it.
Just athleticism.

2605
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:26,260
Yeah.
Luck.

2606
02:01:26,630 --> 02:01:29,110
Little luck.
No luck that you didn't get stomped now.

2607
02:01:29,111 --> 02:01:30,030
So there was some,
some,

2608
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:34,810
some real bull fighters in the ring with
me that I think saved my life every

2609
02:01:34,811 --> 02:01:38,350
single time because I suck.
I at the end of this show,

2610
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:40,190
people are gonna.
Look at this

2611
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,900
and be like,
one.

2612
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:46,670
Tim is an idiot to everybody that does
this job.

2613
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:50,900
These jobs has the biggest balls and our
show.

2614
02:01:50,901 --> 02:01:52,700
Bad Ass.
Hopefully that's what they're gonna get

2615
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:54,080
because this isn't like a Tim Kennedy
look.

2616
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:54,914
Cool.
Show.

2617
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:57,800
This is,
that guy's an idiot.

2618
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:00,860
And everybody else is pretty fucking
picture.

2619
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:03,740
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2620
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:05,810
Look at that picture.
Notice that.

2621
02:02:05,811 --> 02:02:09,050
That's a different bowl.
Did this more than once.

2622
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:12,110
So this,
this bowl is.

2623
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:17,470
He's got his feet up in the air and his
head is inches from you and it's about

2624
02:02:20,091 --> 02:02:22,910
to collide with you and there's no
fucking way you got away in this

2625
02:02:22,911 --> 02:02:24,890
situation.
There's no way that things way too

2626
02:02:24,891 --> 02:02:29,210
close.
What is it like to just get a launched?

2627
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:34,040
Two thousand pounds a fucking meat
vehicle?

2628
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:39,620
It's the other things that I'm
so the.

2629
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:45,350
We did a commercial fishery for a
commercial for fishermen is an episode,

2630
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:47,060
a deadliest catch,
stuff like that,

2631
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:47,950
but you know the,
the.

2632
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:52,190
Those shows in this episodic way.
They really go into the personalities

2633
02:02:52,191 --> 02:02:55,250
and the people that do these jobs,
I think they really go.

2634
02:02:55,430 --> 02:03:00,430
They gloss over how hard that job is.
I'm the there on this decks for 14,

2635
02:03:02,241 --> 02:03:06,890
15 hours working a net poll to a net
poll to put out a net to next,

2636
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:11,720
and then they go in and the net is out
and they have 45 minutes to sleep before

2637
02:03:11,721 --> 02:03:14,900
they have to pull the net back in and
they do that for 28 days.

2638
02:03:15,110 --> 02:03:18,470
So they're getting like cat naps.
So then slowly their,

2639
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,720
their,
their cognitive ability is starting to

2640
02:03:20,721 --> 02:03:25,721
diminish and their physical capability
is starting to diminish and so

2641
02:03:25,731 --> 02:03:28,790
everything is.
But then they're on a platform that is

2642
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:34,050
intended to 12 foot waves that slippery
and the water is 38 degrees.

2643
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:41,470
So everything about what they're doing
is setting them up to die.

2644
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:44,030
So that again,
those are great shows.

2645
02:03:44,031 --> 02:03:45,320
I love it.
Deadliest catch.

2646
02:03:45,321 --> 02:03:47,840
And um,
I think there's a handful of their shows

2647
02:03:47,841 --> 02:03:51,350
now,
but I don't think it has ever gotten

2648
02:03:51,351 --> 02:03:54,260
close enough to showing.
I mean I've always been.

2649
02:03:54,261 --> 02:03:56,390
I did that job for one day and I was
like,

2650
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:59,690
I just need a break dude.
I don't think there's any way you could

2651
02:03:59,691 --> 02:04:04,691
really accurately portrayed unless you
did a 12 hour show and showed you.

2652
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:09,980
And then multiple 12 hour show.
I mean if they did a live stream of you,

2653
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:11,780
that would be the way to do it,
right?

2654
02:04:11,781 --> 02:04:15,170
Like there's satellite feed somehow have
an internet connection showing you

2655
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,210
fishing for 12.
So you can just tune in.

2656
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:19,850
Here's Tim still fishing.
I want to go to sleep.

2657
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:21,860
I'll wake up eight hours later,
get coffee,

2658
02:04:21,861 --> 02:04:23,180
get breakfast.
So we check out Tim,

2659
02:04:23,181 --> 02:04:24,560
look at Tim,
still awake,

2660
02:04:24,710 --> 02:04:26,510
one wrong step,
one wrong,

2661
02:04:26,511 --> 02:04:28,280
not,
and you've got to count on these other

2662
02:04:28,281 --> 02:04:31,880
guys that are also exhaustive.
One second,

2663
02:04:32,130 --> 02:04:35,330
if you have one second to realize where
that person went.

2664
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:37,980
If he's in the water one second and he's
under,

2665
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:43,700
you know,
fuck in 38 degree water with 12 and 12

2666
02:04:43,711 --> 02:04:46,530
foot swells.
And you've been out for 20 days.

2667
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:48,360
And what kind of fish were you catching
there?

2668
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,910
I'm there.
I think we're pulling scallops.

2669
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:53,850
Those were scabs.
So the stuff that was just pushing off,

2670
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:56,730
like we weren't even using any of those,
we're just pushing them back into the

2671
02:04:56,731 --> 02:04:58,620
ocean with a lot of scabs.
They're like these,

2672
02:04:58,621 --> 02:05:00,750
um,
the like little sting rays.

2673
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:03,540
Oh,
they'll chop them up for sometimes.

2674
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:04,890
That's all.
That's all the stuff.

2675
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,860
So the bucket to my left,
that's all the um,

2676
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:11,820
the fish that we had picked.
And this is the leftovers.

2677
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:13,830
Whoa.
That's an inefficient process.

2678
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:18,320
That's crazy.
So all those things die so that you can

2679
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:19,501
bucket.
Oh,

2680
02:05:19,501 --> 02:05:20,370
they're still alive.
Yeah.

2681
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:22,440
Those go back in the water.
Oh,

2682
02:05:22,441 --> 02:05:25,380
okay.
And so what's in the bucket there?

2683
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:29,880
A scallops
clams.

2684
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:32,370
Um,
wow.

2685
02:05:32,371 --> 02:05:36,340
How crazy is that?
All that stuff gets scooped up and you

2686
02:05:36,620 --> 02:05:37,940
don't want it [inaudible].

2687
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,340
That's bizarre.
Yeah.

2688
02:05:41,341 --> 02:05:43,950
Actually,
I think a second after this photo was

2689
02:05:43,951 --> 02:05:47,160
taken,
I took a step and I stepped on one of

2690
02:05:47,161 --> 02:05:48,060
those things,
see it?

2691
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:50,070
They kind of match when they're facing
down.

2692
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:51,540
We'll know in their belly up when
they're white,

2693
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:55,230
but when they're brown and facing down
it's the same color as the rust.

2694
02:05:55,410 --> 02:05:57,900
The deck.
And I stepped on one that I thought was

2695
02:05:57,901 --> 02:06:01,350
the deck and in my,
in my right hand right now,

2696
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:03,060
that is a,
it's a pike.

2697
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:06,090
It's a spike with a,
with a nail sticking out the end of it

2698
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,130
that you,
that's what you use to sort.

2699
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:12,590
And I step on this thing and I fly.
I mean my,

2700
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:14,490
my,
I swear my feet were all the way up at

2701
02:06:14,491 --> 02:06:16,440
the top of that wall.
I five,

2702
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:19,620
five feet up in the air,
just inverted flying through the air

2703
02:06:19,621 --> 02:06:24,621
with 12 foot swells in the sea and a
spike holding onto that spike and I'm

2704
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:29,330
two feet,
three feet from the edge of the boat to

2705
02:06:29,331 --> 02:06:30,330
Jesus Christ.

2706
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:35,340
These guys do it all day long.
You know,

2707
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:38,650
I hope you liked the.
That fish that you walk to the

2708
02:06:38,651 --> 02:06:40,410
supermarket and pluck out at whole
foods.

2709
02:06:40,411 --> 02:06:45,090
You know it got there somehow.
If it says wild caught,

2710
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:48,960
it's freaking wild.
Caught is we have a real problem with a

2711
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:51,990
disconnect from things like that.
Disconnect from food,

2712
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:54,510
disconnect from how difficult these jobs
are.

2713
02:06:54,511 --> 02:06:56,700
Where's the fucking power?
The power going back on.

2714
02:06:56,940 --> 02:07:00,090
Somebody is out there,
so he's out there in that blizzard it.

2715
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:03,780
I mean you could look at.
I think that's one of the things that's

2716
02:07:03,781 --> 02:07:07,740
wrong with the society right now is
everybody is just taken for granted

2717
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:10,020
everything about their lives.
They just want it easy.

2718
02:07:10,021 --> 02:07:11,670
They want it fast,
they want it quick.

2719
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:13,680
That's what people are getting fat.
That's why they're going to the grocery

2720
02:07:13,681 --> 02:07:14,970
store and getting the thing that's on
sale.

2721
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:18,330
That's why they're getting mad at guys
like you that go and talk about hunting

2722
02:07:18,690 --> 02:07:20,670
because they just want the easy
solution.

2723
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:21,670
In truth,
be it.

2724
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:24,780
There isn't an easy solution that's the
right solution.

2725
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:28,780
Usually it's the hard way.
Usually you know the other.

2726
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:31,020
There can be a smart way,
in a smart way,

2727
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:34,710
sometimes is the hard way,
but everybody wants this quick fix.

2728
02:07:34,711 --> 02:07:36,820
Everybody wants to take a pill and they
feel better.

2729
02:07:36,821 --> 02:07:38,470
Better.
That's not how it works.

2730
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:41,230
You know,
like you can't pain or suffering from

2731
02:07:41,231 --> 02:07:43,570
depression and uh,
like you,

2732
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:46,150
if you've been having these thoughts,
I'm going to take a pill and feel

2733
02:07:46,151 --> 02:07:48,250
better.
While that might be a portion of the

2734
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:51,550
solution,
how about you lose 10 percent body fat?

2735
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:53,860
How about you get off the couch?
How about you go make out with your

2736
02:07:53,861 --> 02:07:55,510
wife?
How about you go down on her for a

2737
02:07:55,511 --> 02:07:57,070
couple of our gear,
a bunch of Orgasms,

2738
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:59,290
then have sex with her and then go to
the gym.

2739
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,790
Promise you're gonna.
Feel better after that.

2740
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,860
You know,
instead,

2741
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:07,300
I'm just going to do.
I'm going to have this easy solution and

2742
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:08,920
it just doesn't work.
So I,

2743
02:08:08,990 --> 02:08:11,500
I mean,
I think for me the show is hopefully an

2744
02:08:11,501 --> 02:08:14,800
opportunity to give people.

2745
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:21,370
It's not that easy.
We've made a weird society.

2746
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:26,260
We made a society where we've nerfed all
the hard edges and we're trying to make

2747
02:08:26,261 --> 02:08:28,700
it safer and safer every day and there's
some things that just,

2748
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:30,510
they're just messy.
They're not going to be safe,

2749
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:35,100
but us making everything safer.
It's making us weaker now,

2750
02:08:35,470 --> 02:08:35,851
you know,
in,

2751
02:08:35,851 --> 02:08:38,020
in,
in every time that we've had a weak

2752
02:08:38,021 --> 02:08:41,140
society,
we end up with tough times.

2753
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:46,240
The tough times make hardman that
hardmin make good times than good times

2754
02:08:46,241 --> 02:08:49,870
make weak men than weak men know.
And the cycle just keeps going.

2755
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:53,990
And right now we have week.
We can't even,

2756
02:08:54,110 --> 02:08:57,200
we even allowed to say men,
just the men out there.

2757
02:08:57,380 --> 02:08:58,220
There are some,
but like,

2758
02:08:58,221 --> 02:09:00,110
I don't even know if we're allowed.
Like I just driving,

2759
02:09:00,111 --> 02:09:03,860
driving here to your studio.
I saw the girl scouts office is one

2760
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:07,910
block away and your neighbors that have
no security cameras right back behind

2761
02:09:07,911 --> 02:09:10,460
fries with their backdoor lodged open
with.

2762
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:14,960
I'm like all of that right here in la,
but more importantly to girl scouts,

2763
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:17,660
which isn't even a thing anymore.
Now it's just the scouts.

2764
02:09:17,661 --> 02:09:19,340
There's no boy scouts and there's no
girl scouts.

2765
02:09:19,341 --> 02:09:24,341
There's just the scouts and in a week a
half a million members of the boy scouts

2766
02:09:24,831 --> 02:09:27,980
have left because you can't have just
boy scouts.

2767
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:31,100
You have to have just scouts.
Is that what's going on now?

2768
02:09:31,101 --> 02:09:32,180
Is that how they're doing it?
Yeah.

2769
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:36,760
Yeah.
And a half a million scouts have last.

2770
02:09:36,761 --> 02:09:38,900
I mean that if you go on these camping
trips,

2771
02:09:38,901 --> 02:09:40,350
the boys and the girls go together.
Yep.

2772
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:42,500
That sounds like a good idea.
If you know,

2773
02:09:42,501 --> 02:09:43,640
that's bad.
That's bad idea.

2774
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:44,840
Kids get raped.
Yup.

2775
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:47,720
For sure.
It also changes things.

2776
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:51,990
I don't know how I feel about,
um,

2777
02:09:53,610 --> 02:09:56,430
I think women in the military to be able
to go anywhere and to include special

2778
02:09:56,431 --> 02:09:59,360
operations if they meet the standard.
But

2779
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:03,370
when you have a girl present,
it changes.

2780
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:05,130
Men Act differently,
yes,

2781
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:08,320
period,
and it changes the chemistry of the team

2782
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:11,320
and when,
when you're trying to raise men,

2783
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:15,790
when you're trying to rear boys and have
them becoming men and you're doing

2784
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:17,950
these,
you know you're taking them horseback

2785
02:10:17,951 --> 02:10:22,951
riding or you're teaching them knots or
you're showing them how to set up a tent

2786
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:26,710
or how to purify water.
If there's a girl there,

2787
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:32,640
the focus isn't on time.
That Boland the focuses on is Christina

2788
02:10:32,681 --> 02:10:36,980
watching time,
my Bolin and while that's good and bad,

2789
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:40,220
it's bad.
If you're trying to have an opportunity

2790
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:44,930
to,
to nurture elements that are very

2791
02:10:44,931 --> 02:10:49,931
beautifully separate equally for girls
like I can we teach Christina that

2792
02:10:50,721 --> 02:10:51,950
Bolin?
Absolutely.

2793
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:53,990
Can we teach how to ride a horse 100
percent,

2794
02:10:54,110 --> 02:10:55,880
take her hunting.
She'd be willing to do everything that

2795
02:10:55,881 --> 02:10:57,980
every one of these boys should be doing.
I believe so,

2796
02:10:57,981 --> 02:10:58,814
yes.

2797
02:10:58,990 --> 02:11:00,820
Boy,
in that mix,

2798
02:11:00,850 --> 02:11:02,200
it changes things.
It changes things.

2799
02:11:02,470 --> 02:11:04,180
Yeah.
That's why I've always been supportive

2800
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:06,460
of all girl gyms.
I'm like,

2801
02:11:06,461 --> 02:11:09,370
they should be able to have a fucking
gym when no one's trying to bang them

2802
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:10,750
100 percent.
I mean,

2803
02:11:10,751 --> 02:11:12,790
there's a lot of women that want to be
able to go to the gym and not have

2804
02:11:12,791 --> 02:11:15,820
somebody ogling them and stare at their
ass when they're doing squats.

2805
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:18,970
But all boys gems.
You watched the title fight get

2806
02:11:18,971 --> 02:11:20,620
squirrely this last weekend.
Which one?

2807
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:23,680
Um,
let me Chanko or Amanda.

2808
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,460
Amanda Nunez.
Yes.

2809
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,230
Yes,
yes.

2810
02:11:26,230 --> 02:11:27,020
I did

2811
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:30,500
think if those were two.
So at the end of the,

2812
02:11:30,501 --> 02:11:34,700
in between the fourth and fifth round
when I'm Raquel Pennington,

2813
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:39,050
warner pendants and said I went out and
her team said no,

2814
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:43,640
that it would have been different if it
was two male fighters.

2815
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:45,740
I think it would have been.
I think it would have been as well.

2816
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,840
Yeah.
One,

2817
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:52,890
I,
I believe that had her team let her out.

2818
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,900
She would have regretted it the rest of
her life.

2819
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:59,130
Um,
the failure and it didn't happen by her

2820
02:11:59,131 --> 02:12:01,080
team there in between the fourth and the
fifth round.

2821
02:12:01,290 --> 02:12:04,590
It happened in preparation,
getting her ready for that because I

2822
02:12:04,591 --> 02:12:07,830
think
that,

2823
02:12:08,810 --> 02:12:09,400
that,
that,

2824
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:12,670
those words would never be uttered out
of my mouth in the middle of the fight.

2825
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:16,360
Um,
it would be my team begging and pleading

2826
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:18,980
for them to end the fight.
Um,

2827
02:12:20,230 --> 02:12:22,620
I don't know if there was a route for
her to win that fight.

2828
02:12:22,660 --> 02:12:25,240
There was a path to victory for her.
I don't think that there was.

2829
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,920
Um,
and I think she felt that,

2830
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:28,563
but

2831
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:34,670
I think the journalists,
the MMA media attacked her coaches

2832
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:37,260
unfairly.
One because she's a girl.

2833
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:39,510
I think that played a part in it.
Everybody's like,

2834
02:12:39,570 --> 02:12:42,180
oh my gosh,
this girl fighter in between four and

2835
02:12:42,181 --> 02:12:44,220
five.
She's just a fighter first of all,

2836
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:45,990
right?
And her coaches know her better than

2837
02:12:45,991 --> 02:12:48,940
anybody.
I'm not defending what they did or

2838
02:12:48,941 --> 02:12:51,570
attacking them.
What I'm saying is you're not on either

2839
02:12:51,571 --> 02:12:55,350
side of that fence and you've never had
your feet on that canvas and felt the

2840
02:12:55,351 --> 02:13:00,351
fury and pain of defeat and the
sweetness of success and the worst thing

2841
02:13:01,351 --> 02:13:04,730
ever is regret.
And I have you.

2842
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:05,760
You feel like she would been,

2843
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:09,180
even though I absolutely agree,
that there was no path to victory.

2844
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:11,520
Yep.
I think Amanda Nunez was,

2845
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:14,440
she was searching,
she was destroying her.

2846
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:17,640
Her nose was shattered.
She's getting beaten down and she didn't

2847
02:13:17,641 --> 02:13:19,830
have anything left turn and so she's
like,

2848
02:13:19,890 --> 02:13:22,830
I want out now.
Big John Mccarthy and I talked about

2849
02:13:22,831 --> 02:13:27,831
this yesterday and he feels that his,
that the coroner did a big disservice to

2850
02:13:28,651 --> 02:13:32,190
her by letting her take a in that fifth

2851
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:36,450
round that every fight,
take something out of you and some

2852
02:13:36,451 --> 02:13:40,590
fights take more out of you and there
comes a point in time where there's a

2853
02:13:40,591 --> 02:13:44,580
tipping point fight and that that could
have been the tipping point round,

2854
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:46,410
that she might not ever be the same
again.

2855
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:47,820
And he was saying that,
you know,

2856
02:13:47,821 --> 02:13:51,240
you've got to understand that you only
have a certain amount of holes you can

2857
02:13:51,241 --> 02:13:55,380
punch in your ticket and if she,
especially when you're talking about

2858
02:13:55,381 --> 02:13:58,110
someone who's that ticket off the
tickets of fight card,

2859
02:13:58,130 --> 02:13:59,730
right?
That's the ticket.

2860
02:13:59,810 --> 02:14:01,020
Yes.
It's not,

2861
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:02,790
she's not a,
she's not a janitor.

2862
02:14:03,430 --> 02:14:08,100
Her,
she only has to fight again or be beaten

2863
02:14:08,101 --> 02:14:10,920
down so badly in that fight that she's
never the same physically.

2864
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:13,200
I mean we have every time.
So we talked about this with Robbie

2865
02:14:13,201 --> 02:14:15,230
lawler.
Michael is being,

2866
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:17,380
but it might be the case with Robbie
lawler.

2867
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:20,160
I mean if you look at Robbie lowers last
fight with Javiel dos Anjos.

2868
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:22,780
He didn't really look like the Lara
volt.

2869
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,690
Now,
could that be because of dos Anjos very

2870
02:14:24,691 --> 02:14:25,400
well.
Could have been.

2871
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:29,140
Dos Anjos is a beast in our business to
tell him when he's dealing.

2872
02:14:29,141 --> 02:14:30,830
It's not.
It's not our business.

2873
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:32,280
Tell him he's done it.
His ticket,

2874
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:34,470
but it's his ticket.
What if he wants to quit?

2875
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:38,490
Could I says if he says he wants out.
Like she said she wanted out.

2876
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:41,850
Like there's certain times in a fight
where someone says they want it.

2877
02:14:41,851 --> 02:14:45,010
Like here's a good example.
Do you remember Jeremy Mclellan when

2878
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:46,720
fought Nigel Benn?
Yeah.

2879
02:14:46,770 --> 02:14:51,360
This was the fight that put him into
this catatonic state and bleeding on the

2880
02:14:51,361 --> 02:14:53,130
brain.
People are criticizing him because he

2881
02:14:53,131 --> 02:14:55,830
took a knee.
People were saying like the commentators

2882
02:14:55,831 --> 02:14:56,670
are saying,
what is he doing?

2883
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:57,570
Why is he doing this?

2884
02:14:57,690 --> 02:14:59,820
Well,
he fucking knew something was wrong and

2885
02:14:59,821 --> 02:15:02,610
he took a knee and then blacked out and
then eventually had bleeding on the

2886
02:15:02,611 --> 02:15:03,610
brain.
Like you,

2887
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:06,510
Gerald Mcclellan was a beast,
I mean world champion boxer,

2888
02:15:06,511 --> 02:15:08,910
but he knew something was wrong.
Now,

2889
02:15:08,911 --> 02:15:11,440
if Raquel Pennington had said,
uh,

2890
02:15:11,630 --> 02:15:13,890
I won out and our coach said,
no,

2891
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,990
go back in there,
and then she goes back in there and

2892
02:15:15,991 --> 02:15:20,220
collapses and as bleeding in the brain
and winds up in the same state as Gerald

2893
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:22,620
Mcclellan,
then people would be going crazy.

2894
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:27,090
Um,
I know your point because that's the

2895
02:15:27,091 --> 02:15:29,850
kind of fighter you are.
That's the kind of fighter you were.

2896
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,460
You were a die on your sword guy.
That's,

2897
02:15:32,461 --> 02:15:36,750
that's what you always did.
And you had some fucking amazing fights

2898
02:15:36,751 --> 02:15:41,700
because of that attitude and that never
quit mentality where you were in there

2899
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:44,310
to win or die trying.
God,

2900
02:15:44,311 --> 02:15:47,100
I'm so scared of that regret though.
I understand it.

2901
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:51,900
I don't know if all the things that I
have to because I have

2902
02:15:53,630 --> 02:15:54,990
mentally checking out at the end of the
year.

2903
02:15:54,991 --> 02:15:55,850
Well,
Ramiro fight,

2904
02:15:55,870 --> 02:15:57,590
you know,
I regret that to the day I die that I

2905
02:15:57,591 --> 02:16:00,800
didn't stay because I'm looking at Dana
anticipating my money.

2906
02:16:00,830 --> 02:16:01,281
You know,
Marty,

2907
02:16:01,281 --> 02:16:01,971
look at and be like,
Hey,

2908
02:16:01,971 --> 02:16:03,230
you know,
you're going to pay me for this one.

2909
02:16:03,231 --> 02:16:04,750
This is one hell of a fight,
right?

2910
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:07,520
Looking,
thinking about me destroyed Michael

2911
02:16:07,521 --> 02:16:09,200
bisbing and that's what he's already
thinking about.

2912
02:16:09,220 --> 02:16:11,090
I had already left the ring.
So I have that regret,

2913
02:16:11,091 --> 02:16:13,480
that like nags at me.
Um,

2914
02:16:14,030 --> 02:16:18,230
I can't even imagine what the regret
would be like for me not to go out all

2915
02:16:18,231 --> 02:16:19,460
the,
all like all my,

2916
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:23,240
I don't have posttraumatic stress,
but all the things that nag at me,

2917
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:25,280
it's the things that I didn't do and it
sort of,

2918
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:28,320
but aren't those things would make you
better.

2919
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:31,360
The realization of the mistakes that you
made.

2920
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:35,380
Those are the lessons and that's what
makes you a stronger person,

2921
02:16:35,381 --> 02:16:37,690
but you don't do,
you don't get stronger by doing the

2922
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:41,590
right thing every single time.
Part of getting stronger is by fucking

2923
02:16:41,591 --> 02:16:46,120
up and having this horrible feeling that
you fucked up and realizing you never

2924
02:16:46,121 --> 02:16:47,080
want to feel that again.

2925
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:48,900
Yep.
Yes.

2926
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:54,150
That's how muscle and that's how our
brain works is you damage it and it

2927
02:16:54,151 --> 02:16:55,690
comes back stronger,
you know?

2928
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:58,320
And I think that's how the human
condition is to a degree,

2929
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:02,370
but you know,
like the hurry to failure of the rush to

2930
02:17:02,371 --> 02:17:05,160
failure or um,
yeah,

2931
02:17:05,161 --> 02:17:07,550
that's how you get better.
But I want that,

2932
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:12,660
that point where I'm going to fail to be
so unattainable and so hard to reach

2933
02:17:12,991 --> 02:17:15,350
where if I ever reached that point of
failure and I,

2934
02:17:15,351 --> 02:17:18,000
I mean I,
every time I go to the gym and I'm

2935
02:17:18,001 --> 02:17:20,670
training on it and I want you to come
and hang out with us one day if you ever

2936
02:17:20,671 --> 02:17:24,960
make it back to Austin.
And we try and find the quitter and each

2937
02:17:24,961 --> 02:17:27,240
other every single time that we train
every time.

2938
02:17:27,390 --> 02:17:28,290
And that's what we say.
Look,

2939
02:17:28,291 --> 02:17:30,450
we even have workouts called find the
quitter.

2940
02:17:30,930 --> 02:17:32,040
And we have,
we have guys,

2941
02:17:32,041 --> 02:17:35,400
professional athletes from all sorts of
sports come in and join us and they,

2942
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:38,490
they will quit in the middle of,
in the middle of one of our just

2943
02:17:38,540 --> 02:17:42,480
strength and conditioning workouts.
And it's because my little group,

2944
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:47,500
Shane one myself,
we are looking for that failure and it's

2945
02:17:47,881 --> 02:17:51,000
getting so hard to find just like
shooting.

2946
02:17:51,150 --> 02:17:54,240
I'm looking for that miss [inaudible]
that misses that opportunity that I'm

2947
02:17:54,241 --> 02:17:55,880
going to get better.
I'm looking at that,

2948
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:59,370
that,
that rep that I just can't get or that

2949
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:02,680
5:30 mile one more time,
you know,

2950
02:18:02,730 --> 02:18:04,260
because that's going to be the
opportunity for growth.

2951
02:18:04,261 --> 02:18:07,980
So I agree with you,
but it also has to be hard to reach

2952
02:18:07,981 --> 02:18:09,080
because failure should never be

2953
02:18:09,130 --> 02:18:11,740
easy.
So you think her being able to say I

2954
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:14,110
want out that she still had enough left
to keep going.

2955
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:17,370
I don't know.
I think only her in her corner are going

2956
02:18:17,371 --> 02:18:18,790
to know that.
I would say.

2957
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:22,990
I would say that I agree with you except
I have so much respect for her and I

2958
02:18:22,991 --> 02:18:25,420
think she's one of the toughest girls in
an mma,

2959
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:27,610
one of the toughest people and she's a
fucking animal.

2960
02:18:27,611 --> 02:18:29,590
Raquel Pennington.
She really is tough.

2961
02:18:29,591 --> 02:18:33,310
I'm a big fan of hers.
When someone like her says I'm out,

2962
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:36,700
I'm done.
I just think she's beaten down so badly

2963
02:18:37,150 --> 02:18:40,900
that she doesn't physically have the
ability to fight anymore.

2964
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:44,620
And then she went out and proved that in
the fifth round and took a ferocious

2965
02:18:44,621 --> 02:18:47,110
beating.
But she agrees with you,

2966
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:49,780
she agrees with her coaches,
she agrees.

2967
02:18:49,781 --> 02:18:54,100
She says now after the fact that her
coaches were right and that she had hit

2968
02:18:54,101 --> 02:18:55,210
this moment of weakness.

2969
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:58,210
If I sit on the stool in my coach and I
told my coaches,

2970
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:03,190
I went out and you know I got Great
Jackson Winkle,

2971
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:05,800
John,
Nick Palmisano all sitting there and

2972
02:19:05,801 --> 02:19:08,980
they let me out.
I would hate them forever.

2973
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:14,140
I would.
I would regret my decision and I will be

2974
02:19:14,141 --> 02:19:16,360
mad at them forever and they're there.
They're,

2975
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:17,470
they're some of my best friends.
Now.

2976
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:22,210
What if right after you said that you
collapsed and they took you to the

2977
02:19:22,211 --> 02:19:25,660
hospital and they had to open up your
skull to alleviate pressure on your

2978
02:19:25,661 --> 02:19:30,661
brain because you were bleeding and your
legs stopped working and you're in a

2979
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:33,710
wheelchair,
electrical McClellan trying to relive

2980
02:19:33,711 --> 02:19:36,530
the past through distant foggy memories.

2981
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:39,080
That would be less than ideal.

2982
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:41,180
Yeah,
for sure.

2983
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:42,530
Well,
I understand what you're saying.

2984
02:19:42,531 --> 02:19:46,190
It's like the balance of the physical
limitations of the human body and then

2985
02:19:46,191 --> 02:19:49,760
the limitations of the mind and the
minds willingness to find a way out,

2986
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:52,670
which brings me to the one thing that I
wanted to get to before we leave.

2987
02:19:52,671 --> 02:19:57,671
This is waterboarding and this is,
this is something that came up because

2988
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:01,280
you were defending.
What did gail,

2989
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:02,510
Gina.
Gina,

2990
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,090
what is your name and spell?
Spell.

2991
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:09,310
And she is the person that was being
appointed by to lead the CIA.

2992
02:20:09,390 --> 02:20:11,240
Yup.
And there was a bunch of people that

2993
02:20:11,241 --> 02:20:15,770
were saying that she shouldn't be
because she advocated torture and you to

2994
02:20:15,771 --> 02:20:19,940
defend her,
decided to get waterboarded.

2995
02:20:20,230 --> 02:20:23,000
Yup.
We've actually been talking about this

2996
02:20:23,001 --> 02:20:25,180
for the past hour and a half.
Yeah.

2997
02:20:25,990 --> 02:20:27,370
We have,
we've been talking about it's

2998
02:20:29,170 --> 02:20:33,130
the slow erosion of,
of the human condition.

2999
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:37,740
US getting softer and US getting weaker
and US getting nerfing the edges and

3000
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:40,120
finding the easy outs and the easy
solution.

3001
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:42,610
Um,
the conversation of middle ground,

3002
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:45,370
finding a way that we can communicate
with people and have a discussion.

3003
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:46,960
Um,
so we've been,

3004
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:50,880
we've been having this discussion for
the past 90 minutes and um,

3005
02:20:51,430 --> 02:20:56,330
what I have is a bunch of people that
are sane what something is,

3006
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:59,920
but they don't know what that is.
Man.

3007
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:03,440
I know what torture is.
I've seen it in Africa,

3008
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:04,790
I've seen it.
South America,

3009
02:21:04,850 --> 02:21:07,430
I've seen it in the Middle East.
I've seen it on almost.

3010
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:11,180
I'm pushing 20 trips overseas in a
military capacity,

3011
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:14,730
a handful of combat deployments,
you know,

3012
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:16,420
from looking for poachers,
human traffic,

3013
02:21:16,421 --> 02:21:18,080
ears,
drug cartel.

3014
02:21:18,390 --> 02:21:21,980
I'm kind of piracy.
The things that I have done,

3015
02:21:21,981 --> 02:21:25,250
like you want to talk about knowing
intimately what torture is.

3016
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:30,370
I fucking know what torture is.
Pouring water on of face is not torture

3017
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:33,320
Kate,
if you starve them,

3018
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:35,600
if you beat them,
if you isolate them,

3019
02:21:35,601 --> 02:21:36,680
if they're there for,
you know,

3020
02:21:36,681 --> 02:21:39,920
you're the only getting the yes,
we can start adding things onto it.

3021
02:21:40,490 --> 02:21:42,800
But the,
the thing that was the most irritating

3022
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:44,970
was everybody's just throwing out this,
well,

3023
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:48,290
let's talk about morality.
And this woman is immoral to be in this

3024
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:52,400
position.
I remember people jumping to their

3025
02:21:52,401 --> 02:21:55,250
deaths on nine slash 11 because they
didn't look at burnt alive,

3026
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:59,540
right?
And then I saw a guy on his knees and

3027
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:04,541
have his throat slit open by somebody's
pulling his hair back and sliding that

3028
02:22:04,641 --> 02:22:06,980
knife across his throat.
That was one of the guys that she

3029
02:22:06,981 --> 02:22:08,960
interrogated,
not I'm not saying two wrongs make a

3030
02:22:08,961 --> 02:22:10,580
right,
but she interrogated them to get a

3031
02:22:10,581 --> 02:22:12,290
question,
to get questions out of them,

3032
02:22:12,291 --> 02:22:13,970
to try to save more Americans.

3033
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:16,640
The intent was to try to save more
lives.

3034
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,021
They say,
okay,

3035
02:22:18,021 --> 02:22:23,021
well if it's not that bad,
then why did it work and this is why,

3036
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:26,610
and this is what nobody understands and
because they can't understand the

3037
02:22:26,611 --> 02:22:31,611
difference between the easy way and the
hard way is because these people that we

3038
02:22:31,771 --> 02:22:35,310
were waterboarding are cowards.
They were pussies.

3039
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:38,340
They're impotent little bullies their
whole entire lives.

3040
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:41,970
If I put you on that water board,
I could waterboard you for days.

3041
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:45,150
You have your moral convictions and you
would never change because you believe

3042
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:47,370
in what's right and wrong and that's a
great and beautiful thing.

3043
02:22:47,850 --> 02:22:52,170
They're not you.
They're pieces of shit that that throw

3044
02:22:52,171 --> 02:22:54,810
acid on,
little girls that fly planes into

3045
02:22:54,811 --> 02:22:58,850
buildings because it's capitalist.
That's who these people are and if

3046
02:22:58,940 --> 02:23:01,650
they're only tough when they're
surrounded by 60,

3047
02:23:01,651 --> 02:23:06,240
70 other of their friends,
but you take one of them away from that

3048
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:10,200
and you put them in a in a position
where they're powerless and that's what

3049
02:23:10,201 --> 02:23:15,201
waterboarding is to powerless and they
cave and they cower in seconds.

3050
02:23:16,180 --> 02:23:18,270
Like I don't need to drive a nail
through their hands.

3051
02:23:18,271 --> 02:23:20,670
I don't need to pull their teeth out.
I don't want to take a drill bit and

3052
02:23:20,671 --> 02:23:23,430
drive it through their fingernails.
That's torture.

3053
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:29,100
This is us pouring water on a cowards
face and they freak out and people can't

3054
02:23:29,101 --> 02:23:33,640
understand that because they can't
understand what these people are and

3055
02:23:34,170 --> 02:23:36,270
their animals.
The,

3056
02:23:36,271 --> 02:23:36,840
the,
these,

3057
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:41,340
these aren't beautiful religious people
that are trying to do the best thing for

3058
02:23:41,341 --> 02:23:46,341
the families.
These people were the worst of our kind.

3059
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:51,270
These were the Nazis of the 19 forties,
but this is the current version of it

3060
02:23:51,271 --> 02:23:55,080
and the these radical fanatics that are
doing anything for any reason to hurt

3061
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:58,680
anybody so they can feel better about
themselves and you take them out of that

3062
02:23:58,681 --> 02:24:01,050
power.
They take them out of that control.

3063
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:04,530
You take them out of that opportunity
where they can be the bully and they're

3064
02:24:04,531 --> 02:24:08,820
just shadows of themselves and then they
give you everything that you need and

3065
02:24:08,821 --> 02:24:11,130
what you need is an opportunity to save
more lives.

3066
02:24:11,650 --> 02:24:12,220
Well,
there's two.

3067
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:15,580
There's two things that were discussed
about this one,

3068
02:24:15,581 --> 02:24:20,581
that your situation that you were in was
not in any way similar to the situation

3069
02:24:21,010 --> 02:24:23,110
they were in because you were doing it
with your friends.

3070
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:27,010
You knew you were going to be okay.
You willingly did this.

3071
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:30,380
The whole process was very controlled.
You.

3072
02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:35,380
You weren't being held by people,
spoke a different language in a country

3073
02:24:35,381 --> 02:24:37,240
that hates you.
It's,

3074
02:24:37,360 --> 02:24:40,120
it's a situation where you knew you were
safe,

3075
02:24:40,150 --> 02:24:44,500
so you could relax yourself and calm
down and tolerate it to the point where

3076
02:24:44,501 --> 02:24:47,150
you knew that you would be okay.
Yep,

3077
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:52,460
and what was the other side?
The other side is if torture works,

3078
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:56,950
isn't that the best form of torture
you're going to be?

3079
02:24:56,951 --> 02:24:58,510
Okay.
I mean,

3080
02:24:58,570 --> 02:25:00,040
if,
if torture does work,

3081
02:25:00,041 --> 02:25:01,810
and I don't know if torture works.
I've never been torched.

3082
02:25:01,811 --> 02:25:05,020
I've never been around torture.
And I know there's a debate both in both

3083
02:25:05,110 --> 02:25:06,630
torture doesn't work.
It doesn't work.

3084
02:25:06,650 --> 02:25:08,260
Doesn't work.
So that's not torture.

3085
02:25:08,350 --> 02:25:10,990
No.
So you think you feel like that works,

3086
02:25:10,991 --> 02:25:11,920
but torture doesn't.

3087
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:14,900
So I think maybe we're

3088
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:19,160
arguing about vernacular and verbs or
you're forcing someone to do something

3089
02:25:19,161 --> 02:25:21,110
they don't want to do and you're,
you're freaking them out.

3090
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,410
Yeah.
You're doing something physical to them.

3091
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:25,953
So

3092
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:28,290
I think we just have to define torture
if,

3093
02:25:28,291 --> 02:25:30,600
if,
if it's me doing something to somebody

3094
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:33,480
that makes them uncomfortable is
torture.

3095
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:38,550
I mean me asking a pointed question that
somebody in an interrogation room down

3096
02:25:38,551 --> 02:25:40,230
at lapd could be torture,

3097
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:41,450
right?
You know,

3098
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:43,040
um,
if you smack him in the face,

3099
02:25:43,041 --> 02:25:44,000
is it become torture?
Yeah.

3100
02:25:44,001 --> 02:25:44,930
Is that,
is that torture?

3101
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:45,973
Right?
Um,

3102
02:25:46,550 --> 02:25:48,170
well if I know if I hit him with a phone
book,

3103
02:25:48,171 --> 02:25:51,140
maybe the problem is the word,
maybe the problem is defining the word

3104
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:52,330
your,
I mean,

3105
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:55,790
then they called it enhanced
interrogation techniques when,

3106
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:59,720
if you're trying to get information out
of someone that would save American

3107
02:25:59,721 --> 02:26:01,760
lives,
it seems to me,

3108
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:05,870
I may be ignorant,
but waterboarding seems to me to be one

3109
02:26:05,871 --> 02:26:07,740
of the most humane ways to do it.
I,

3110
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:09,800
I agree with that.
You're not going to do any permanent

3111
02:26:09,801 --> 02:26:13,040
damage to the person.
It's not like what they did a John

3112
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:15,500
Mccain when he was a prisoner of
Vietnam.

3113
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:19,070
That disturbed the shit out of me when
that guy was on Fox News and he called

3114
02:26:19,071 --> 02:26:22,070
them songbird mccain because he was,
he was saying that,

3115
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:23,480
you know,
terrorism.

3116
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:25,550
That torture other worked on became
like,

3117
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:27,650
how could you stoop like that?
I mean,

3118
02:26:27,651 --> 02:26:28,700
how,
how could you do that?

3119
02:26:28,730 --> 02:26:29,141
I mean,
you,

3120
02:26:29,141 --> 02:26:30,620
you know,
what that guy has been through to

3121
02:26:30,621 --> 02:26:33,470
humiliate him and humiliate yourself by,
by,

3122
02:26:33,770 --> 02:26:36,050
by taking that position on television
like,

3123
02:26:36,051 --> 02:26:38,930
that was so disappointing.
It's

3124
02:26:40,050 --> 02:26:42,130
about usable information.
We're,

3125
02:26:42,210 --> 02:26:45,480
we're,
we're questioning and if you cross that

3126
02:26:45,481 --> 02:26:48,720
threshold of torture where you are doing
damage,

3127
02:26:48,721 --> 02:26:51,660
physical damage,
where they'll tell you anything that's

3128
02:26:51,661 --> 02:26:56,400
not usable information that you're going
to say that you've been dating your

3129
02:26:56,401 --> 02:27:00,900
producer for seven years and secretly
like I could get you to say anything

3130
02:27:00,990 --> 02:27:02,810
under the right conditions that doesn't
do any.

3131
02:27:02,820 --> 02:27:04,020
Just want to stop the pain.
Yeah,

3132
02:27:04,021 --> 02:27:05,910
just anything to make it stop.
Um,

3133
02:27:06,390 --> 02:27:08,220
that's not what was happening here.
And,

3134
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:10,410
and when we start talking about
morality,

3135
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:11,491
if they're saying,
okay,

3136
02:27:11,491 --> 02:27:13,650
if this is a moral act than,
than okay,

3137
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:17,340
this make me and all of my friends that
have done all sorts of,

3138
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:20,340
some in some cases,
terrible things are we now a moral

3139
02:27:20,341 --> 02:27:24,720
people because we did it in the interest
of protecting our country and serving

3140
02:27:24,721 --> 02:27:27,960
our country and,
and providing protection for our

3141
02:27:27,961 --> 02:27:28,560
freedoms.

3142
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:32,100
And Hey,
I know those are cliche phrases that

3143
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:36,960
people grab onto and I don't want to,
but it then by extension,

3144
02:27:37,050 --> 02:27:42,050
throwing and lobbying those accusations
at her extend to a to me and to,

3145
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:46,200
to the things that I've done.
And I think I'm a very moral person.

3146
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:51,290
And I try to be a good person in every
way I can imagine.

3147
02:27:51,781 --> 02:27:52,830
I'm not perfect,
I'm not,

3148
02:27:53,370 --> 02:27:58,370
but I try and the politics of bleeding
over and misusing words,

3149
02:28:00,211 --> 02:28:02,820
manipulating everything just so it fits
your agenda,

3150
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,440
but nobody's in the middle of the
ground.

3151
02:28:04,441 --> 02:28:08,670
Nobody's a green and nobody has the best
interest at heart and that's the people

3152
02:28:09,330 --> 02:28:13,650
like the best interest should always be
serving the people and none of them are

3153
02:28:13,651 --> 02:28:17,160
doing that.
They only care about what is going to

3154
02:28:17,161 --> 02:28:19,140
get them reelected or what's going to
give them more power,

3155
02:28:19,150 --> 02:28:22,040
was getting more money from the lobby or
what's going to give them more

3156
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,650
clout for the next vote.
What's going to give a little handout

3157
02:28:24,651 --> 02:28:26,120
from the president or what's,
you know,

3158
02:28:26,140 --> 02:28:28,370
whatever games that play that happened
on the beltway.

3159
02:28:29,180 --> 02:28:31,550
That's what the.
And that was an example of that in the

3160
02:28:31,551 --> 02:28:36,110
most horrible of ways because it came
down to a human lives.

3161
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:40,490
It came down to somebody that had been
serving their country since the eighties

3162
02:28:40,670 --> 02:28:43,280
in the best way that she knew how,
in the ways that we're legal for her to

3163
02:28:43,281 --> 02:28:46,550
do it,
and everybody else just manipulating the

3164
02:28:46,551 --> 02:28:49,610
narrative to fit their agenda when I'm
just sitting here being like,

3165
02:28:50,330 --> 02:28:51,920
how about the people and how about
freedom?

3166
02:28:51,950 --> 02:28:54,380
Who's fighting for us is,
where are you guys just going to keep

3167
02:28:54,381 --> 02:28:57,500
bickering about this?
So me strapped,

3168
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:00,250
starving myself to that board.
Um,

3169
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:01,550
I'll tell you,
it's harder.

3170
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:05,570
Do what's easy is to lay there strapped
and have somebody put water on your face

3171
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:06,050
too.

3172
02:29:06,050 --> 02:29:08,660
It's hard.
When I did to Steven crowder,

3173
02:29:09,490 --> 02:29:13,010
watch his hands where he'd reach up and
pull the.

3174
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:15,170
He couldn't have,
he couldn't take it.

3175
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:18,770
He would pull the rag off his face.
So many times I pulled the rag off my

3176
02:29:18,771 --> 02:29:20,180
face,
not once,

3177
02:29:20,181 --> 02:29:21,380
right?
Every single time I said,

3178
02:29:21,381 --> 02:29:21,621
no,
no.

3179
02:29:21,621 --> 02:29:23,110
Poor longer.
No,

3180
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:24,170
no.
Use the host.

3181
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:26,090
Use the bucket right now.
You're at a two.

3182
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:30,800
I need you at an eight.
Now I need CIA interrogation friends,

3183
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:33,260
right?
And I'm sitting there willingly with my

3184
02:29:33,261 --> 02:29:35,720
hands.
What the sensation of me drowning as

3185
02:29:35,721 --> 02:29:40,070
that water's running into my sinuses,
showing that was intentional.

3186
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,360
I understand.
People are like,

3187
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:42,620
oh no.
He was safe.

3188
02:29:42,621 --> 02:29:47,210
He wasn't even tied down.
I did that to demonstrate how a man of

3189
02:29:47,211 --> 02:29:52,211
resolve can do it effortlessly and how
it's not torture because I could

3190
02:29:52,611 --> 02:29:56,450
willingly lay there with my hands free
to pull the rag off at any juncture,

3191
02:29:56,810 --> 02:29:57,590
but I did it.

3192
02:29:57,590 --> 02:30:01,340
I just sat there and I asked for more.
I understand that,

3193
02:30:01,730 --> 02:30:04,850
but I also understand the position that
people take where they say,

3194
02:30:04,851 --> 02:30:08,780
you knew you were safe and so this is
why you had this resolve.

3195
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:11,030
You are.
You're not in enemy soil.

3196
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:15,020
Being interrogated by isis being
strapped down by them where you didn't

3197
02:30:15,021 --> 02:30:17,290
know what was next.
If you think this,

3198
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:20,330
what would be next,
let's say Rachel maddow from MSNBC,

3199
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:22,790
because we agree on so much,
she's like,

3200
02:30:22,791 --> 02:30:24,560
Hey,
I want you to come onto my show.

3201
02:30:24,590 --> 02:30:27,770
I'm going to bring in five CIA
interrogators and we're going to do it

3202
02:30:27,771 --> 02:30:30,380
live.
You're in control of nothing.

3203
02:30:31,310 --> 02:30:33,740
Do you think the result would be any
different from not the same?

3204
02:30:33,741 --> 02:30:36,050
Because you're on a television show and
you're still,

3205
02:30:36,051 --> 02:30:38,090
you're,
you're Americans are going to do this to

3206
02:30:38,091 --> 02:30:39,500
you.
You haven't been captured.

3207
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:41,030
You're not an enemy soil.

3208
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:43,940
You're not.
So how far did on how far do we have to

3209
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:47,420
go?
You have to kind of be the person who's

3210
02:30:47,450 --> 02:30:50,570
really captured is really capture.
It's not a game.

3211
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:52,970
It's like if you get choked out in the
street,

3212
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,500
you can't tap out,
right?

3213
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:57,650
If you get into a physical fight to the
death of someone and they take your

3214
02:30:57,651 --> 02:31:00,680
back,
you can't tap out right in this

3215
02:31:00,681 --> 02:31:01,880
situation,
you know,

3216
02:31:01,881 --> 02:31:04,850
you can tap out,
you know that even if it's cei

3217
02:31:04,851 --> 02:31:06,620
interrogating you and they're yelling at
you,

3218
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:11,000
there's a part of your brain that knows
I'm on Rachel maddow show.

3219
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:13,850
They don't kill soldiers on Rachel
maddow show.

3220
02:31:14,250 --> 02:31:15,750
This is true.
Um,

3221
02:31:15,890 --> 02:31:18,170
so I don't know how I could better have
illustrated.

3222
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:20,310
I think you did a fantastic job.
I think the problem

3223
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:23,940
lies in it's impossible to really
recreate it without you being an actual

3224
02:31:23,941 --> 02:31:25,680
prisoner of war.
Um,

3225
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:27,673
do what we do,

3226
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:29,443
uh,

3227
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:34,700
reverse the roles we're talking about
snatching these guys from their bomb

3228
02:31:34,701 --> 02:31:39,410
making facility in whisking them to
upgrade and pouring water on their face.

3229
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:42,140
What happens to me and my friends when
we're captured,

3230
02:31:43,250 --> 02:31:44,960
we waterboarded no,
no,

3231
02:31:45,110 --> 02:31:45,780
no,
no,

3232
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:47,450
I'm not.
I'm not saying that what they do to us

3233
02:31:47,451 --> 02:31:48,650
makes what we do to them.
Right.

3234
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:53,370
But I'm saying is it's better.
I'm saying it,

3235
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:53,880
it's better.
I mean,

3236
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:55,760
so that's what I was saying before.
If it is torture,

3237
02:31:55,910 --> 02:31:59,180
if you want to use the word torture,
like we'd use the words drugs,

3238
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:02,420
right?
Drugs are coffee and it's also heroin,

3239
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:03,710
right?
They're all drugs.

3240
02:32:03,711 --> 02:32:04,970
Caffeine is a drug,
right?

3241
02:32:05,450 --> 02:32:07,670
Torture.
If you're just going to say torture,

3242
02:32:07,940 --> 02:32:11,240
I'll take that torture every day because
he knows what that is.

3243
02:32:11,241 --> 02:32:12,680
Yeah.
Because even if it sucks,

3244
02:32:12,770 --> 02:32:14,330
yeah,
I'm going to start to live.

3245
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:17,420
I'm going to be slowly,
carefully,

3246
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:20,840
methodically,
painfully murdered.

3247
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:24,630
Yeah.
And that's my only option there.

3248
02:32:24,670 --> 02:32:27,710
There is never any other option.
If I got captured,

3249
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:31,130
there's no moral equivalency.
I think we can both agree there's no.

3250
02:32:31,131 --> 02:32:33,350
I mean,
between us and them there's not.

3251
02:32:33,410 --> 02:32:37,610
But here's the thing,
mccain himself said that she shouldn't

3252
02:32:37,611 --> 02:32:41,780
be appointed because she willingly
participated in torture.

3253
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:43,020
He said that.
Yeah.

3254
02:32:43,370 --> 02:32:44,780
The,
what did you think about that?

3255
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:47,100
I've one respect his opinion.
I,

3256
02:32:47,190 --> 02:32:50,090
the things that he has done,
whether we agree on things

3257
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:51,980
are,
is irrelevant.

3258
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:53,920
His,
his resume speaks for itself.

3259
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:58,940
Agree and I think very few people could
speak to torture better than him.

3260
02:32:59,570 --> 02:33:00,680
I agree with that as well.
Um,

3261
02:33:00,770 --> 02:33:05,770
so him coming from that position and
saying that she isn't eligible to serve,

3262
02:33:06,620 --> 02:33:09,800
um,
is very powerful statement.

3263
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:13,040
Um,
I also feel that I'm pretty intimately

3264
02:33:13,100 --> 02:33:17,880
familiar with torture and that I
understand the full spectrum of,

3265
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:20,450
of what somebody can do selflessly for
their country.

3266
02:33:20,451 --> 02:33:25,190
And I'm selfless selfishly for their own
satisfaction as a psychopath.

3267
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:30,290
I'm like Zarqawi's enforcer that would
go around and kill people in front of

3268
02:33:30,291 --> 02:33:33,470
their own family members had carried
around a battery power drill.

3269
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:37,400
And I saw that we tracked him.
So

3270
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:45,170
I also know that when she was doing all
of these things for her whole entire

3271
02:33:45,721 --> 02:33:48,270
career,
one day were you have to look at the

3272
02:33:48,271 --> 02:33:51,570
context of the time and what was
happening.

3273
02:33:51,980 --> 02:33:54,210
Um,
and when she did every single one of

3274
02:33:54,211 --> 02:33:56,640
those things,
they were authorized techniques.

3275
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,930
They were encouraged,
they were successful in some degrees,

3276
02:34:01,350 --> 02:34:04,530
um,
to some degree and so she was trying to

3277
02:34:04,531 --> 02:34:06,840
do the best that she could in the,
with the,

3278
02:34:07,590 --> 02:34:10,260
in some cases limitation that she had.
Um,

3279
02:34:11,130 --> 02:34:16,130
and I think that is a trait that I want
in somebody leading the CIA that is,

3280
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:20,950
that they are going to do the best that
they can with what they have and what

3281
02:34:20,951 --> 02:34:23,080
they're allowed to do.
And

3282
02:34:24,860 --> 02:34:27,490
I liked that,
I realized that,

3283
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:30,110
but this isn't someone who's talking
about this in the,

3284
02:34:30,150 --> 02:34:31,860
you know,
the comfort of a boardroom.

3285
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:36,000
This is someone who's dealing with it in
time of war and you're dealing with some

3286
02:34:36,001 --> 02:34:38,310
of the most horrible people that we've
ever experienced it or making these

3287
02:34:38,311 --> 02:34:42,390
videos of cutting journalists heads off
and sending them to their families.

3288
02:34:42,420 --> 02:34:43,530
Yeah,
I mean this is,

3289
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:45,420
this is,
this is really what

3290
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:49,080
we were experiencing when people were

3291
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:52,780
deciding to use these enhanced
interrogation techniques.

3292
02:34:53,050 --> 02:34:56,650
This is what they were up against.
This isn't something you can discuss in

3293
02:34:56,651 --> 02:35:01,651
a classroom and and get a full sense of
the tone and what was happening in these

3294
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:03,784
people's lives.

3295
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:06,310
Nine slash 11 was the tip of the
iceberg.

3296
02:35:06,790 --> 02:35:11,790
When that happened there,
there were hundreds of other plans to do

3297
02:35:12,011 --> 02:35:15,220
similar things with that.
One was just successful.

3298
02:35:15,250 --> 02:35:17,620
They had been trying to others and they
have tried other sense,

3299
02:35:17,950 --> 02:35:20,470
whether it's a shoe bomb,
whether it's a parish train,

3300
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:22,870
whether it's a San Bernardino bombing,
whether it's a,

3301
02:35:23,350 --> 02:35:24,001
a,
a,

3302
02:35:24,001 --> 02:35:26,230
a,
a garbage truck and France,

3303
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:27,850
you know,
or London Bridge.

3304
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:28,710
It's any,
any.

3305
02:35:28,710 --> 02:35:33,710
They have consistently been trying to do
that and duplicate and replicate that.

3306
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:40,110
The reason that it hasn't happened again
to that scale to that level is because

3307
02:35:40,570 --> 02:35:45,570
of the uncompromising selflessness of
heroes trying to protect Americans.

3308
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:53,520
Now I don't want to go into what is the
greater good care?

3309
02:35:53,521 --> 02:35:56,300
Are we losing morality coming?
That's a rabbit hole that we could talk

3310
02:35:56,301 --> 02:35:58,720
about forever,
but man,

3311
02:35:58,730 --> 02:35:59,960
I just want to preserve life.

3312
02:36:00,060 --> 02:36:02,910
Why do you think that concept is so hard
for people to grasp?

3313
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:04,470
Because Gary,
well,

3314
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:07,950
not just that,
but the concept that the reason why this

3315
02:36:07,951 --> 02:36:12,951
hasn't happened more often is because of
these people doing the heart work.

3316
02:36:14,310 --> 02:36:17,760
Why is that so hard for people to
understand your skin hard work?

3317
02:36:17,970 --> 02:36:21,540
I just made a guide to MTV show just so
they could see for the first time that

3318
02:36:21,541 --> 02:36:24,300
people work hard so they can have food
and they have work hard.

3319
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:26,780
They get of oil and they got power that
people.

3320
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:31,200
They may look at a post when I don't
have a shirt on.

3321
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:35,220
Everybody says men tend to loving being
off Usada.

3322
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:37,860
I've looked the same sense as 19 years
old.

3323
02:36:37,970 --> 02:36:40,530
I have looked exactly like this with the
same eight pack,

3324
02:36:40,531 --> 02:36:43,860
with the same muscle definition since I
was an 18 year old kid.

3325
02:36:44,130 --> 02:36:47,070
I don't even know how many times I've
been tested from the military for Usada

3326
02:36:47,170 --> 02:36:49,590
to different events.
I've been cleaned my whole entire

3327
02:36:49,591 --> 02:36:51,630
career,
but nobody can in their mind.

3328
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:56,520
They can't understand to get from here
to there is hard work.

3329
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:58,230
No,
there has to be an easier way.

3330
02:36:58,290 --> 02:37:00,600
It has to be steroids or it has to be
this or it has to be that.

3331
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:02,790
It's the same way.
They're protected and they're safe,

3332
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
but they can't grasp the idea of the
hard work that it took to keep them

3333
02:37:08,431 --> 02:37:09,020
there.
I don't even

3334
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:10,490
think they're thinking that deeply into
it.

3335
02:37:10,491 --> 02:37:12,530
I think they're just talking shit.
I think people see you.

3336
02:37:12,531 --> 02:37:15,830
You Look Jack Storage.
I don't there's that much thought,

3337
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,000
but

3338
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,230
I think it's.
I think it's the same lack of thought.

3339
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:22,250
It's the same lack of consideration of
what it took for us,

3340
02:37:22,251 --> 02:37:27,251
for us currently to be safe and what it
still takes for us to be safe.

3341
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:31,410
That's,
that's the departure.

3342
02:37:31,411 --> 02:37:32,640
That's,
that's the break in,

3343
02:37:32,641 --> 02:37:33,230
in,
in,

3344
02:37:33,230 --> 02:37:36,390
in the thought process is they just want
the easiest way and they don't want to

3345
02:37:36,391 --> 02:37:40,050
even believe that this hard way is the
way that actually has happened.

3346
02:37:40,350 --> 02:37:45,090
What is the alternative?
What's the alternative suggestion and

3347
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:47,400
instead of enhanced interrogation
techniques,

3348
02:37:47,401 --> 02:37:50,640
waterboarding,
instead of letting the CIA do what it's

3349
02:37:50,641 --> 02:37:54,200
done up until now,
what is the alternative I can.

3350
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:56,880
Does anybody offered in,
you know,

3351
02:37:57,210 --> 02:37:59,490
in response to that instead of doing it
that way,

3352
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:02,160
do it this way.
I mean now we're just leaving them and

3353
02:38:02,220 --> 02:38:04,860
nothing.
We're leaving them all be great for how

3354
02:38:04,861 --> 02:38:05,694
long

3355
02:38:06,830 --> 02:38:08,770
years?
No,

3356
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:11,090
it's.
It's like now they're in perpetual

3357
02:38:11,091 --> 02:38:16,091
purgatory for eternity
that there is no other solution.

3358
02:38:17,291 --> 02:38:19,090
Nobody's presented one.
They're just complaining about the

3359
02:38:19,091 --> 02:38:20,170
options that.
Exactly.

3360
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:22,930
But that's the point is that there's no
one's said,

3361
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:25,060
look,
the CIA has done a terrible job.

3362
02:38:25,061 --> 02:38:26,230
This is the way to do it.
Right?

3363
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:28,840
They're just saying,
I don't know what that is.

3364
02:38:29,020 --> 02:38:31,300
Torture people.
And I agree with that.

3365
02:38:31,510 --> 02:38:32,440
Yeah.
Shoot.

3366
02:38:32,441 --> 02:38:35,380
People with paintball pellets.
Don't shoot him with bullets.

3367
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:36,400
She,
you know,

3368
02:38:36,400 --> 02:38:38,470
hit them with rubber bats.
Don't hit them with.

3369
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:40,750
What are they saying?
What are they saying?

3370
02:38:40,751 --> 02:38:44,830
If they do you think part of the problem
is the vast majority of the population

3371
02:38:44,831 --> 02:38:48,340
will never truly understand combat.
They'll never truly understand what

3372
02:38:48,341 --> 02:38:51,640
people are capable of in the worst case
scenario.

3373
02:38:51,670 --> 02:38:52,503
God,
I hope so.

3374
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:53,290
Yeah.
I mean,

3375
02:38:53,290 --> 02:38:58,120
I hope that 99 percent of this
population never has to see any of the

3376
02:38:58,121 --> 02:39:00,690
things that we've seen otherwise,
uh,

3377
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:01,533
failed.

3378
02:39:02,110 --> 02:39:06,790
Do you think that maybe it wouldn't be
the worst idea in the world to force

3379
02:39:06,791 --> 02:39:10,660
people to have some sort of mandatory
service,

3380
02:39:10,661 --> 02:39:15,661
whether it's mandatory service in the
coast guard or whether it's the peace

3381
02:39:16,121 --> 02:39:20,410
corps or whether it's the military,
just some service of your country for a

3382
02:39:20,411 --> 02:39:23,950
predetermined period of time like they
do in Israel like they do in South Korea

3383
02:39:23,951 --> 02:39:26,670
like they do in several other countries.
Yeah,

3384
02:39:26,740 --> 02:39:29,230
I would love that.
Do you think that that would fix things?

3385
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:32,710
I think he's give people an
understanding of what's required.

3386
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:35,350
Like send people to Afghanistan for six
months,

3387
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:37,270
let people understand like,
holy shit,

3388
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:39,670
like God damn,
Kansas is pretty fucking bad ass.

3389
02:39:40,950 --> 02:39:44,470
How about to send them to El Paso?
A more come down there on the Flores?

3390
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:45,493
Yeah.
Yeah.

3391
02:39:45,810 --> 02:39:49,960
I mean I understand that the world is
not San Francisco.

3392
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:55,380
There are dark places and you could see
that on cnn all you want and look at it

3393
02:39:56,111 --> 02:39:59,650
on our t until you can smell it until
you live it.

3394
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:02,260
Until we,
I have to take these pills every single

3395
02:40:02,260 --> 02:40:04,030
day,
which gives me the shits or otherwise I

3396
02:40:04,031 --> 02:40:05,800
get malaria.
We are,

3397
02:40:05,801 --> 02:40:07,600
they are all these people walking
around?

3398
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:09,380
Are they taking these pills?
Oh,

3399
02:40:09,430 --> 02:40:10,420
they're not.
They,

3400
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:12,520
some of them have mullet.
Oh,

3401
02:40:12,530 --> 02:40:14,250
we're the having that reality

3402
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:17,430
sink into them.
That way I'm going to eat that goat and

3403
02:40:17,431 --> 02:40:22,320
I have to pull the pieces of hair out of
my mouth that that's the reality for the

3404
02:40:22,321 --> 02:40:24,690
majority of the world.
It's um,

3405
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:29,840
I would love for somebody to force
everybody to have a taste of hard work.

3406
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:33,450
Well,
everybody wants something free,

3407
02:40:33,451 --> 02:40:35,370
right?
They want the government to do many

3408
02:40:35,371 --> 02:40:37,830
things for them,
provide services and do things for her.

3409
02:40:37,831 --> 02:40:42,820
But the government is essentially just a
group of us and a group of private

3410
02:40:42,821 --> 02:40:45,270
versions of us.
I don't want anybody telling me I have

3411
02:40:45,271 --> 02:40:47,310
to go do something.
I don't want anybody telling me I have

3412
02:40:47,311 --> 02:40:50,580
to go serve somewhere,
but I don't think it's the worst option

3413
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:55,880
to get people if we really hit a pivotal
point where people have such a complete

3414
02:40:56,250 --> 02:40:59,910
lack of appreciation and understanding
of what it takes to make the world work

3415
02:40:59,970 --> 02:41:00,803
correctly.

3416
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:05,850
That might be one of the only viable
solutions is some sort of mandatory

3417
02:41:05,851 --> 02:41:09,180
service for some agreed upon period of
time.

3418
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:12,450
It doesn't happen when you're young.
I don't think.

3419
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:15,960
I think a war fighter should always and
only be volunteer.

3420
02:41:16,470 --> 02:41:17,370
I agree with you.
Um,

3421
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:21,660
but man,
serving your country for two years,

3422
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:23,970
working on the border of working at a
homeless shelter,

3423
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:26,670
um,
humanitarian aid,

3424
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:29,520
working in a hospital.
I mean all the different things that we

3425
02:41:29,521 --> 02:41:33,240
could do with all of these people that
would have their eyes opened.

3426
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:36,660
Um,
I think it strengthened people.

3427
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:38,450
Could,
I think it could their,

3428
02:41:38,470 --> 02:41:39,470
I mean,
their character,

3429
02:41:39,480 --> 02:41:40,530
their soul,
their bodies,

3430
02:41:40,531 --> 02:41:42,270
their minds,
all of it.

3431
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:44,340
Yeah.
Just being forced to understand that

3432
02:41:44,341 --> 02:41:47,190
there's a lot of messy work that's
required to make this thing work

3433
02:41:47,191 --> 02:41:51,090
correctly and we all benefit from it.
But a lot of us benefit from it and just

3434
02:41:51,091 --> 02:41:54,630
sit at home and play video games and eat
cheetos and do nothing.

3435
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:57,800
And you still complained about Mexicans.
Sneak out.

3436
02:41:59,550 --> 02:42:01,400
It's fucking crazy.
You know,

3437
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:06,560
everything that we want,
whether it's success or food.

3438
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:09,870
Good looks.
I'm at a beautiful girlfriend,

3439
02:42:09,871 --> 02:42:11,160
girl,
beautiful boyfriend.

3440
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:14,640
All of that is always just on the far
side of hard work.

3441
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:18,060
Everything.
I don't know.

3442
02:42:18,061 --> 02:42:21,900
There's some dudes I've never going to
get a hot chick is you work all day.

3443
02:42:23,820 --> 02:42:25,800
Shit rolls of the dice out.
They're genetically.

3444
02:42:25,801 --> 02:42:27,210
There's just,
it's never going to pan out.

3445
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:31,680
Everything I've ever wanted has always
been everything I've ever had.

3446
02:42:31,681 --> 02:42:32,730
Everything I've ever gained,
every,

3447
02:42:32,770 --> 02:42:37,770
every bit of who I am has always been on
the far side of hard work.

3448
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:42,330
Um,
the Lance Armstrong and I were talking

3449
02:42:42,390 --> 02:42:46,350
and arguing about a performance
enhancing drugs,

3450
02:42:46,490 --> 02:42:48,330
you know,
when I fought for two world titles and I

3451
02:42:48,331 --> 02:42:50,820
lost two world titles,
you know,

3452
02:42:50,821 --> 02:42:54,540
he wants seven and um,
but he was in the dirtiest of dirty

3453
02:42:54,541 --> 02:42:55,374
sports.
Yeah.

3454
02:42:55,560 --> 02:42:57,450
I mean,
and he said,

3455
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:59,800
doesn't Tim Kennedy,
you know,

3456
02:42:59,810 --> 02:43:01,770
world champion.
Doesn't that sound better?

3457
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:03,570
You know,
and yeah,

3458
02:43:03,571 --> 02:43:04,830
it does,
it does,

3459
02:43:05,130 --> 02:43:09,960
but I would have lost everything because
everything I've ever had has been from

3460
02:43:09,961 --> 02:43:11,100
hard work and that would have been,

3461
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:16,020
is he trying to justify his own
existence dummy.

3462
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:17,920
What's happening there?
And also it's a different sport.

3463
02:43:18,010 --> 02:43:19,900
You know,
it's just a different thing between no

3464
02:43:19,901 --> 02:43:22,750
one gets hurt.
If you take epo and you run your bike

3465
02:43:22,780 --> 02:43:24,010
faster,
it doesn't.

3466
02:43:24,011 --> 02:43:27,220
No one gets hurt if you're on something
and it allows you to beat someone's

3467
02:43:27,221 --> 02:43:31,750
brains in better and you walk away from
a title knowing that you cheated,

3468
02:43:31,751 --> 02:43:36,520
but the guy you beat was natural.
That to a guy like you is a torture.

3469
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:38,980
The you're going to be,
you're gonna be in prison and the rest

3470
02:43:38,981 --> 02:43:41,370
of your life with that thought bouncing
around in year head,

3471
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:48,720
that's not the same thing.
So the same thing when we guys like

3472
02:43:48,791 --> 02:43:53,791
Vitor Belfort who failed multiple tests
were world champions multiple times,

3473
02:43:54,670 --> 02:43:58,740
sort of he really only one once against
randy because randy got cut memory.

3474
02:43:58,741 --> 02:44:02,770
You got that crazy icon and he won the
tournament when he was 19,

3475
02:44:02,771 --> 02:44:07,771
but even then he was sauced up so he
still feels like a world champion to

3476
02:44:08,081 --> 02:44:08,830
him.

3477
02:44:08,830 --> 02:44:09,930
I would never want that.
I'm not.

3478
02:44:09,931 --> 02:44:13,630
I'm not rationalizing,
and he paid the price though is and he

3479
02:44:13,631 --> 02:44:16,390
will pay the price,
but I mean he paid the price physically.

3480
02:44:16,391 --> 02:44:18,910
You look at the transformation between
TRT v toward that,

3481
02:44:18,911 --> 02:44:22,240
knocked out luke rockhold.
We'll kick and Michael Bisping,

3482
02:44:22,270 --> 02:44:25,180
Dan Henderson.
He was a fucking monster and then the

3483
02:44:25,181 --> 02:44:28,420
deflated version of him where his body
is,

3484
02:44:28,421 --> 02:44:31,150
endocrine system's failed.
It doesn't produce testosterone anymore.

3485
02:44:31,270 --> 02:44:35,590
Can't take a punch anymore is he doesn't
look even remotely similar to what it

3486
02:44:35,591 --> 02:44:36,990
used to look like,
don't.

3487
02:44:37,050 --> 02:44:40,510
It's?
I'm look at the difference between him

3488
02:44:40,870 --> 02:44:42,880
and then look at Yoel Romero.
Okay.

3489
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,700
Yoel Romero is 40,
41 years old.

3490
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:49,690
He looks the same older than Victorville
and he's fucking jacked.

3491
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:54,050
Obviously you're dealing with
significant genetic advantage and you

3492
02:44:54,051 --> 02:44:55,510
all said that when he was on the
podcast,

3493
02:44:55,511 --> 02:44:56,920
you know,
it was a great podcast.

3494
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:59,560
I don't know if you saw,
but Joey Diaz translated for them back

3495
02:44:59,561 --> 02:45:00,171
and forth,
you know,

3496
02:45:00,171 --> 02:45:02,410
they spoke Spanish and then translated
to English,

3497
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:05,440
but he said if you go to Cuba,
it's like regular people,

3498
02:45:05,470 --> 02:45:07,780
regular people you see a bus,
drivers jacked.

3499
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:10,120
He's like,
you're dealing with a phenomenal gene

3500
02:45:10,121 --> 02:45:12,540
pool here.
They're baseball players that come out

3501
02:45:12,541 --> 02:45:14,050
and you're like,
they touched the ball and it goes over

3502
02:45:14,051 --> 02:45:14,811
the fence.
I mean,

3503
02:45:14,811 --> 02:45:17,110
there three printers.
Let's say this is the,

3504
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:21,430
this is the dark,
dark aspects of the slave trade.

3505
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:22,810
I mean,
this is what you're dealing with the

3506
02:45:22,811 --> 02:45:24,550
best of the best,
the strongest,

3507
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:27,370
most athletic,
the ones who can work the hardest.

3508
02:45:27,371 --> 02:45:31,360
Those are the ones they wanted.
That is essentially a big part of the

3509
02:45:31,361 --> 02:45:36,361
gene pool that is Cuba.
Then you deal with the decades and

3510
02:45:36,790 --> 02:45:39,370
decades of extremely high level athletic
performance,

3511
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:40,480
uh,
with the,

3512
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:44,860
with all these different sports and all
these different programs where they

3513
02:45:44,861 --> 02:45:48,490
develop the very best athletes in the,
in their area.

3514
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:50,410
I mean they just,
the wrestlers,

3515
02:45:50,411 --> 02:45:52,600
the boxers,
the judo players,

3516
02:45:52,810 --> 02:45:57,400
I mean phenomenal athletes and that the
gene pool is just outstanding.

3517
02:45:58,420 --> 02:45:59,260
The,
um,

3518
02:46:02,260 --> 02:46:06,190
Hector Lombard,
another physical example,

3519
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:11,220
but looking at vidors body shrink and
you will stay the same mindset,

3520
02:46:11,770 --> 02:46:13,350
the same.
Um,

3521
02:46:14,030 --> 02:46:19,030
what do you think the heart,
not the actual beating cardiovascular

3522
02:46:19,341 --> 02:46:22,700
system,
but like the soul of Vidor,

3523
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:27,880
he visibly looked deflated and every one
of his fights post Usada he knows he's

3524
02:46:29,301 --> 02:46:33,950
going into that in a compromised state.
So when he was going into it,

3525
02:46:33,951 --> 02:46:36,630
like when he got tested,
one of the times,

3526
02:46:36,650 --> 02:46:39,890
one of the reasons why the whole
testosterone replacement therapy got

3527
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:42,860
eliminated as,
or got tested randomly and he was off

3528
02:46:42,861 --> 02:46:46,880
the charts like,
look to the point like superhuman levels

3529
02:46:46,881 --> 02:46:47,900
of testosterone.
They're like,

3530
02:46:47,901 --> 02:46:49,880
what in the fuck are you doing,
man?

3531
02:46:50,110 --> 02:46:52,310
Like you,
you have this massive advantage and

3532
02:46:52,311 --> 02:46:57,311
massive confidence advantage and just
physically looks like a demon,

3533
02:46:58,370 --> 02:47:01,220
right?
One that when that's gone,

3534
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:05,660
now you're less than a regular man
physically and mentally,

3535
02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:08,480
physically and mentally because you're
tired all the time.

3536
02:47:08,750 --> 02:47:11,600
Your body's tired.
You're not producing good levels of

3537
02:47:11,601 --> 02:47:13,880
testosterone.
He talked about it openly about they

3538
02:47:13,881 --> 02:47:17,150
tested his testosterone.
So the testosterone was 70 year old man

3539
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:21,260
and he's fighting in a cage for living
at a very high level.

3540
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:27,120
I don't know the um,
I still think it comes down to hard

3541
02:47:29,091 --> 02:47:31,490
work.
I think it certainly does,

3542
02:47:31,491 --> 02:47:35,030
but all the hard work in the world.
If you're built like,

3543
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:37,010
you know,
fucking Kevin Smith.

3544
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:38,700
No disrespect Kevin.
I love Ya

3545
02:47:41,170 --> 02:47:42,200
marrow.
Yeah,

3546
02:47:42,201 --> 02:47:44,900
just fucking Yoel Romero is going to
pound your face into the dirt every

3547
02:47:44,901 --> 02:47:48,770
time.
Kevin Smith is a millionaire that is

3548
02:47:48,830 --> 02:47:51,940
massively successful in what he wants to
do and disaster.

3549
02:47:52,910 --> 02:47:57,910
Super smart that it didn't go into cage
fighting and he works hard and does a,

3550
02:47:58,041 --> 02:48:00,740
you go all the way back to the beginning
when he's writing scripts and he's doing

3551
02:48:00,741 --> 02:48:03,860
standup comedy.
That dude was the first.

3552
02:48:03,861 --> 02:48:08,810
They're the last to leave and then is
success is not,

3553
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:10,160
is unquestioned.
Yeah.

3554
02:48:10,161 --> 02:48:11,830
No,
I agree with you 100 percent.

3555
02:48:11,860 --> 02:48:15,230
He most certainly worked hard,
but I'm talking about genetics.

3556
02:48:15,530 --> 02:48:19,940
Like there's genetic.
I mean Francis and Ghana has freakish

3557
02:48:19,970 --> 02:48:21,300
genetics.
I mean,

3558
02:48:21,320 --> 02:48:23,960
you know,
obviously a steep meo chick also has

3559
02:48:23,961 --> 02:48:25,910
very good genetics.
Still a giant person,

3560
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:31,540
but the genetics and Francis have has in
comparison to the average person.

3561
02:48:31,671 --> 02:48:34,880
You could work all you want.
You're not competing with that.

3562
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:35,753
Yeah.

3563
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:38,480
There's some people that just get a
shit.

3564
02:48:38,481 --> 02:48:40,400
Roll the dice.
He uh,

3565
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:44,720
he also lost his title fight though.
Buddy lost a steep way who was also got

3566
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:47,260
pretty fucking phenomenal genetics.
He's a giant duties,

3567
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:52,040
tough as shit,
very skilled and has a just a lifetime

3568
02:48:52,290 --> 02:48:53,660
championship.
No experience.

3569
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:54,830
Like,
I don't want to say anything nice about

3570
02:48:54,831 --> 02:48:55,930
that guy.
First of all I get that.

3571
02:48:55,970 --> 02:48:57,560
It's hard for me to say anything nice
about him,

3572
02:48:58,100 --> 02:48:59,140
but he,
he,

3573
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:02,510
that guy worked hard,
worked hard and toughest shit.

3574
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:06,410
Became the world champion and he looks
he has,

3575
02:49:06,440 --> 02:49:07,710
he's had a bod

3576
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:10,380
for forever.
I don't ever remember looking at him and

3577
02:49:10,381 --> 02:49:11,850
be like,
that's a scary dude.

3578
02:49:12,150 --> 02:49:13,110
I look at him,
Oh my God,

3579
02:49:13,111 --> 02:49:15,320
I want to fight him.
And then like take that British accent,

3580
02:49:15,330 --> 02:49:17,370
shove it down his throat and then make
fun of him.

3581
02:49:17,371 --> 02:49:19,260
They make more videos about them than
beat them up again.

3582
02:49:19,380 --> 02:49:20,760
Well,
he's been clean his whole career and

3583
02:49:20,761 --> 02:49:23,520
never,
never looked back like a guy who was

3584
02:49:23,521 --> 02:49:27,090
doing anything suspicious in his hard
work.

3585
02:49:27,091 --> 02:49:30,480
Hard work that made him a warm champion.
Got toughness.

3586
02:49:30,880 --> 02:49:32,100
All right.
No more talking.

3587
02:49:32,101 --> 02:49:34,830
Nice about that guy talking about
anything else,

3588
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:36,620
but what,
after you retired,

3589
02:49:36,650 --> 02:49:39,660
can you just let it go with a guy like
him or did you guys talk so much?

3590
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:41,070
Shit,
I was just talking shit still.

3591
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:41,640
Yeah,
no,

3592
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:43,650
totally.
I mean I've never really had a real

3593
02:49:43,651 --> 02:49:45,840
problem with anybody,
you know,

3594
02:49:46,530 --> 02:49:48,540
in 17 years as a professional fighter.

3595
02:49:48,850 --> 02:49:51,500
I mean I could pick a couple of
instances like we,

3596
02:49:51,550 --> 02:49:53,220
he,
Mike and I would never be friends.

3597
02:49:53,221 --> 02:49:55,020
Like we're not going to go drink a pipe
together,

3598
02:49:55,350 --> 02:49:56,730
but like,
why not though?

3599
02:49:57,300 --> 02:49:59,700
I think we're just different people,
but why not now?

3600
02:49:59,730 --> 02:50:01,830
If he retires and you retire.
Oh,

3601
02:50:02,130 --> 02:50:05,370
I mean we're just different during the
airport.

3602
02:50:05,371 --> 02:50:07,530
One day we'd totally hanging onto each
other.

3603
02:50:07,531 --> 02:50:08,460
You're at a bar,
like,

3604
02:50:08,461 --> 02:50:09,780
let me buy you a drink.
You Fuck?

3605
02:50:10,180 --> 02:50:11,340
Like what?
What are we talking about?

3606
02:50:11,341 --> 02:50:13,650
Hunting?
Or we're going to talk about a shooting.

3607
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:15,570
Let's wish they were,
we'd drink a pint,

3608
02:50:15,571 --> 02:50:19,010
like we're never going to be friends,
but I would totally sit down,

3609
02:50:19,030 --> 02:50:21,720
have dinner with them and talk about the
good old days.

3610
02:50:21,721 --> 02:50:23,640
And um,
because you won,

3611
02:50:24,980 --> 02:50:28,020
it also helps me.
I don't even think about it that way.

3612
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:30,900
No,
I was like Luke rockhold know I'd sit

3613
02:50:30,901 --> 02:50:32,970
and talk to him [inaudible] I'd sit and
talk to him.

3614
02:50:33,590 --> 02:50:36,000
You know,
we gotta get you out of here because I

3615
02:50:36,001 --> 02:50:36,390
know you got it

3616
02:50:36,390 --> 02:50:39,650
flight to catch,
but I want to tell you at all my times

3617
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:42,290
of calling fights,
one of the most powerful experiences

3618
02:50:42,291 --> 02:50:44,870
that I ever saw really wasn't even
televised.

3619
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:50,080
It was in between you,
you knocking out Sapo in the fight for

3620
02:50:52,911 --> 02:50:57,911
the troops and you got on top of the
cage and all the troops were there

3621
02:50:58,370 --> 02:51:02,240
cheering you on and nobody there was.
Nobody wasn't televised.

3622
02:51:02,480 --> 02:51:05,300
There'll be saw this,
but you were pointing it all those

3623
02:51:05,301 --> 02:51:07,250
people and saying,
I love you.

3624
02:51:07,370 --> 02:51:09,290
I do this for you.
I love you.

3625
02:51:09,440 --> 02:51:12,350
And they were cheering and it was a
fucking powerful moment.

3626
02:51:12,351 --> 02:51:14,630
Man.
That was a powerful moment that to this

3627
02:51:14,631 --> 02:51:19,631
day I think about sometimes because that
was a different kind of a fight.

3628
02:51:19,730 --> 02:51:23,470
It was a different kind of an audience
and it was a,

3629
02:51:23,650 --> 02:51:26,780
it was a different kind of a moment.
And when you launched that left hook on

3630
02:51:26,781 --> 02:51:30,170
him and connected him and stopped him
and then jumped up on the cage and did

3631
02:51:30,171 --> 02:51:33,020
that.
That was that audience.

3632
02:51:33,050 --> 02:51:37,250
The love they had for you.
And the love you had for them was it was

3633
02:51:37,251 --> 02:51:37,911
in the air,
man.

3634
02:51:37,911 --> 02:51:40,080
It was fucking amazingly powerful.
I'll

3635
02:51:40,690 --> 02:51:42,370
never forget that moment to the day I
die.

3636
02:51:42,430 --> 02:51:43,480
Not,
not the fight,

3637
02:51:43,540 --> 02:51:46,570
not the fight camp.
Um,

3638
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:52,200
I couldn't breathe.
I had so much love for everybody.

3639
02:51:52,811 --> 02:51:53,501
That was like,
I,

3640
02:51:53,501 --> 02:51:56,830
I would have melted out of fan ost
myself,

3641
02:51:56,831 --> 02:52:00,250
vaporized and taken every one of my bits
and just handed it to everybody there.

3642
02:52:00,690 --> 02:52:02,890
Um,
and not existed just so that they could

3643
02:52:02,891 --> 02:52:06,370
have anything that they wanted because
there was just nothing

3644
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:09,970
in me that I wanted more than just to
give them anything I had.

3645
02:52:10,700 --> 02:52:14,440
Um,
and I think I believed that it came out

3646
02:52:14,620 --> 02:52:16,000
when you,
when you were saying what you were

3647
02:52:16,001 --> 02:52:17,080
saying,
the way just,

3648
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:18,870
you could feel the,
the,

3649
02:52:18,990 --> 02:52:19,480
the,
the,

3650
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:23,080
the honesty and sincerity in it.
I'm not a good liar.

3651
02:52:24,780 --> 02:52:26,680
I got to work on that.
No,

3652
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:29,100
don't work on it,
Tim Kennedy or bad motherfucker.

3653
02:52:29,110 --> 02:52:30,460
I appreciate you.
Keep doing it,

3654
02:52:30,461 --> 02:52:31,300
bro.
I will.

3655
02:52:31,301 --> 02:52:32,290
You too.
All right,

3656
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:33,370
that's it.
Bye everybody.
