1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,330
I keep getting reminded of,

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:03,570
you know,

4
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,510
that Bill Bradley story that you told,

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,001
you know,

6
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,580
and kind of repeating the
same thing Bill Bradley was,

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,920
he was a terrible basketball
player at to start big,

8
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:11,581
gangly,

9
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:12,290
slow,

10
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,530
not,

11
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,260
not terrible,

12
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,100
but he wasn't good,

13
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,370
but he had the most relentless pursuit
of improvement of anybody that I've ever

14
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:19,771
read.

15
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,780
You can probably pick up the story,

16
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,000
but you know,

17
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,480
Drew's dribbling the ball,

18
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:24,780
you know,

19
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,490
constantly eight hours,

20
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:27,690
nine hours a day,

21
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,260
you know,

22
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,630
again over and over and over again.

23
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,130
And that kind of repetition,

24
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,401
you know,

25
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:32,910
it's,

26
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,080
it's all part of this same pattern of
doing the same thing over and over again.

27
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,381
Well,

28
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm glad you bring up
music is a great story.

29
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,010
It's kind of another like
Freddie Roach type thing.

30
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,090
You take the,

31
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,400
he's a,

32
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,760
he's a white guy who happens to be tall,

33
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,130
but he loves basketball.

34
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,690
He's like nine years old.

35
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,630
And I know this myself because I
love basketball and I was a kid,

36
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,720
just the sound of the ball
swishing through the net.

37
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,750
He just loved that side of the,

38
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,691
the sound of that.

39
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,524
The feel of it.

40
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,750
So he had this sort of
visceral love of the game,

41
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,160
but he stunk at it.

42
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:03,000
He was tall,

43
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,571
awkward,

44
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,404
slow.

45
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,120
There's no way he'd become good at it.

46
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:11,121
So he decided he was going
to train himself from a
very early age and I call it

47
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:12,990
um,

48
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,201
you know,

49
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:18,201
they have a concept in called deliberate
practice where you learned to practice

50
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:20,610
what you're not good at because we often,

51
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,010
if we're taking up archery or basketball,

52
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,130
we find something that we're good
at and we tend to just repeat that.

53
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,950
And then our practice
becomes very one sided,

54
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,700
deliberate practices to practice
on what you're not good at.

55
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,400
I call it resistance practice,

56
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,990
actually practicing it.

57
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,080
What is painful in enjoying the pain?

58
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,580
And that's Bill Bradley.

59
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He put these special glasses on his head
that prevented him from looking down so

60
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:48,871
he could,

61
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:53,180
he would dribble on a court
for 10 hours or 10 hours,

62
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,120
three or four hours,

63
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,890
and he couldn't look down at his feet,

64
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,720
which trained him to dribble.

65
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,501
That's the worst thing.

66
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:59,940
You can have fear always looking down.

67
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,460
You're not able to see where
what's going on on the court.

68
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,450
So he did.

69
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,200
He did that.

70
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,200
He went on a cruise with his parents
across to England and he didn't,

71
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,070
he wanted to build a practice there.

72
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:16,071
He brought his basketball and below deck
there with these incredibly long alleys

73
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,290
that would go from one end of the shift
to the other that were very narrow.

74
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,890
He would put on his special glasses and
he would dribble back and forth in this

75
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:27,030
narrow area so that he could dribble
with absolute complete control.

76
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,210
He devised all of these other exercises
where he could train himself to see

77
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,760
almost behind himself or at least way
over to the side on and on and on until he

78
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,950
became so good that by the time he got
into college at Princeton and then later

79
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,040
he played for the New York Knicks and
the 70s with all the great championship

80
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,700
teams.

81
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,020
People would look at bill and they go,

82
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:49,854
oh my God,

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,810
this guy is a born.

84
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,640
He was born with a basketball in his hand.

85
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,960
He's naturally gifted.

86
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,520
He is so graceful.

87
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,230
He has eyes in the back of his head.

88
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,064
He can make a pass.

89
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,741
Walt Frazier,

90
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:00,640
without even looking.

91
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
They didn't realize that he had gone
through the most insanely rigorous,

92
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:07,180
painful,

93
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
deliberate form of practice ever invented
by a single human athlete at a very

94
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,630
early age.

95
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,983
Um,

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,460
and it made,

97
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,250
it made the game fun for him.

98
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,990
It was sure it was a lot of pain,

99
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,690
but by the time he got good
and he was in high school,

100
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,210
all the girls were admiring him.

101
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,841
You know,

102
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,880
he's got invited to go to Princeton.

103
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,391
I mean,

104
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:32,620
it paid off and he got a huge level of
pleasure and the game became incredibly

105
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,250
fun.

106
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,620
But it was all based on these
insane moments and periods of,

107
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:39,220
of pain that he put himself through.
