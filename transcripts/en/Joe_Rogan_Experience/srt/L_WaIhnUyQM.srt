1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,960
We live Jesus Christ.
Jamie,

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,060
you're so.
You're so quick on the draw.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,550
You fucking maniac.
Give Jamie a couple of days off and he 

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,680
started chomping at the bit to hit that 
goal button.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,610
Did you hear that?
Microsoft made a fucking ai and they had

6
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:31,611
a deleted after a day became because it 
became a Hitler loving sex robot.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,880
What it.
Somebody found a way to make it do that 

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,271
though.
Like of course they found a flaw in the 

9
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:44,601
AI that will make it repeat stuff.
And so a team of people on twitter like 

10
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,730
purposely tried to make it racist and 
all this crap.

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,680
That's pretty funny.
Well,

12
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,681
it,
it highlights the problems with an 

13
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:57,141
artificial intelligence though,
like the idea that you've created 

14
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,070
something that's some sort of a computer
someone kinda manipulate.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,150
I mean if it's this easy to do something
that fucking Microsoft created,

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,360
you would have thought that Microsoft 
being a computer manufacturer and the 

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,070
manufacturer of operating systems would 
understand the goddamn internet.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,500
It's kind of weird though.
It's so realistic that that's what kids 

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,150
actually are.
I have to deal with everyday on twitter,

20
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,540
like a seven year old goes on twitter,
it's going to see racist shit,

21
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,890
just going to see porn,
it's going to see all this crazy stuff.

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,160
So it's actually pretty realistic.
Well it isn't a way.

23
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:31,161
Right.
That means that this is a real problem 

24
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:34,610
with.
That is a real problem with like what 

25
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:34,610
kids are being exposed to like right 
away.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,040
If they go online,
like I think they go online as soon as 

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,040
they get a phone.
Right.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,960
Soon as kids get a phone,
they start talking to each other and 

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:43,960
they understand that the foam gets 
online,

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:43,960
they're online,
right?

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,711
So they're exposed to fucking everything
you get on facebook and if you're doing 

32
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:53,811
that man,
if you're getting on twitter like on a 

33
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,631
daily basis,
you're going to be exposed to some 

34
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:56,631
really nutty shit.

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,410
And these fucking kids like they did not
being prepared for this.

36
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,180
There's just been thrown into this.
It's,

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,680
it's so weird.
Just hearing what my mom's,

38
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,350
she's,
she's been on the Internet recently.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,090
She got the internet like a year ago.
Just her,

40
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,190
her language,
how she talks is different.

41
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:17,670
Like she's talking about retweeting and 
hashtags and it's like my mom never used

42
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,671
that language before.
Somebody made a post on the Rogan for 

43
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:22,671
the other day.
That was so perfect.

44
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,340
They were like,
before the Internet,

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,910
I never had any conversations about 
feminism.

46
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,120
I never argue with anybody about 
transgenders.

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,540
There's like all these things that all 
of a sudden became an issue because of 

48
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,871
the Internet.
Just like we were were transgender 

49
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:38,871
rights.
We're kids.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,440
It wasn't.
There was nothing.

51
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,630
We were led to like run them over with 
cars.

52
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:47,631
I thought I couldn't do that,
but there was that renee richards who 

53
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,810
was a high profile case because renee 
richards.

54
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,690
Is that the name?
Renee renee the tennis player.

55
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,720
Is that the right name?
Might not be the right name.

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,750
The last name might be off,
but there was a tennis player who was a 

57
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,430
man who was not a very good tennis 
player,

58
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,890
I should say.
Not very good as a professional.

59
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,510
That's it.
That's the right name.

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Yeah.
A lot better than me because I don't 

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,520
play tennis.
Right.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,170
So he became a woman and just started 
fucking dominating,

63
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,430
like became like a top flight tennis 
player and a lot of people were like,

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,780
Whoa,
Shit.

65
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,700
Like what?
How is,

66
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,720
how does that work?
Is that,

67
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,620
is that really a woman like this was 
like the precursor to the uh,

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the bullshit about the chick who used to
be a dude for 30 years became a check 

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,440
for two years and they started fighting 
female mma with this is a way the female

70
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:35,770
mma one is a way worse case because 
you're talking about someone beating the

71
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:40,771
shit out of somebody would mail bones 
and male mind and mailed tendons and all

72
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:41,740
that jazz.

73
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,530
But Renee Richards was beaten a lot of 
fucking,

74
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:49,531
like really good test players that were 
born women and there was a real 

75
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,480
controversy behind it where people like,
man,

76
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,290
I don't fucking know like how,
what is,

77
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,870
how do you,
they should have a transgender league is

78
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,130
what they should have.
They should have transgender men.

79
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,380
And transgender is,
we're like,

80
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,410
well,
we want to be accepted as a regular 

81
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:07,410
person.
Well you are but not in fucking sports.

82
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,460
There's a reason why I can't play like 
in the Olympics is like they're,

83
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:15,461
they're,
they're experiencing social pressure 

84
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,630
with this.
This is a big part of it and I think for

85
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,631
some sports that don't have anything to 
do with explosiveness and sheer power,

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,920
and then you could say like,
well,

87
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:28,030
Serena Williams is always going to be 
stronger and faster than a lot of men.

88
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,630
It's true,
but certainly one of them is Serena or 

89
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:33,630
their sister.

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,400
The drug testing people came to their 
house.

91
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,680
They locked themselves in a fucking safe
room.

92
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,460
What do you think that is?
Do you think that they just got done 

93
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,460
smoking a joint though and they're like,
ah,

94
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,460
no,
no,

95
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,430
I do not.
Brian.

96
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,820
I think his steroids,
I think it's performance enhancing 

97
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,391
drugs.
I have friends that are girls that take 

98
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:58,291
testosterone there,
Jujitsu girls and they compete and they 

99
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,960
travel all over the place and compete 
and they take fucking testosterone.

100
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,580
The testosterone in the Jujitsu world,
this is coming from obviously a person 

101
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,440
who takes testosterone.
Me,

102
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,640
Serena Williams locked herself in a 
panic room and drug test to mix up.

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,580
There was no mixed up.
She knew what the fuck was going on.

104
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,070
Like as a stocker,
someone's trying to kill me.

105
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,810
If that chicken at tennis racket,
she could beat the fuck out of anyone in

106
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:23,350
the world.

107
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,620
You think she's really worried about 
some fucking dork with the pocket 

108
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:28,660
protector comes to our house with a Piss
Cup.

109
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,320
Why can't condition you just not 
answered the door.

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,110
Oh,
you can't.

111
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,480
They have rules.
The USA Da.

112
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,940
They need to know where you are at all 
types to crazy.

113
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:41,941
Their rules are Donaldson Rooney who 
obviously fights for the UFC is one of 

114
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,120
the top pros in the world.
Right.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Donald fucking.
So rony gets a call from the US Ada 

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,870
while he's doing something for the UFC.
He flew to Vegas for the UFC and they 

117
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,770
were at your house.
We trying to test you.

118
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,160
He was like,
well,

119
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,950
I'm at the UFC like we have to tell us 
exactly where you are.

120
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:57,620
He like,
well,

121
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,010
the fucking

122
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,270
UFC knows where I am,
man.

123
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,790
I'm here for the UFC.
Like what are you talking about?

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,380
Like they,
they literally,

125
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,990
he wasn't there competing was there to 
watch,

126
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,650
but they,
they will tell you,

127
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,010
you have to tell them where you are in 
any given day all the time.

128
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,750
You're always have to be able to be 
reached.

129
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,590
Wow.
Yeah.

130
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,240
So she fucking do.
Yeah,

131
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,970
but you think it instead of a panic 
room,

132
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,890
she could just be like,
I'm not going to answer the door.

133
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,891
I'm just going to be asleep.
Like why is she confirmed that she was 

134
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:25,310
scared.
She locked herself in her panic room and

135
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:29,090
she confirms that she really was scared.
It's a great escape is a great excuse.

136
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,860
Look,
it might be the case,

137
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
the guy at the door,
look,

138
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,790
I might be full of Shit.
The guy at the door might have been some

139
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,650
serial killer look and fuck.

140
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,800
Who also works for the USA Da.
He might've been swole.

141
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,900
Who might've been scary looking?
Who the fuck knows?

142
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,690
I don't know,
but if I had a guess,

143
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,870
that chick is so fucking explosive.
She's so fast and it is a ridiculously 

144
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:55,781
competitive sport.
I mean unbelievably competitive and the 

145
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:58,160
money is astronomical.
You're talking about millions of dollars

146
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:02,570
to be someone like a Serina Williams.
Of course she would take steroids if she

147
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:07,571
could get away with it.
If she get away with and she doesn't 

148
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,330
have a problem with it ethically.
If she was one of those people that grew

149
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:10,940
up in the world of competitive sports 
like she is,

150
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,320
you know,
they realize,

151
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,540
man,
it's a fucking dog eat dog world.

152
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,550
You know what I had Lance Armstrong 
onto?

153
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,700
He didn't want to take steroids.
He didn't want to do all that stuff.

154
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,250
He did it because everybody else was 
doing it and they realized like,

155
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,000
we gotta do this.

156
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,290
We want to win.
If you want to win,

157
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,820
you've got,
we got to fucking do this.

158
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,290
They all do it,
man.

159
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,750
It works.
And that's why sports suck.

160
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,310
They don't suck.
Yeah,

161
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,370
because you don't know who's on what and
who's doing what time are you just 

162
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:36,370
watching bullshit.
Yeah,

163
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,601
but that's part of the fun is wondering 
whether or not a guys on the Jews.

164
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:43,790
Do you see Rosie Donald's brother caught
way he said about us.

165
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,510
Yeah.
Well he's Roseville.

166
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,190
Donald's brother's gay and this is what 
he said.

167
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,320
He said it's like gay porn with a 
different ending.

168
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,810
That's hilarious.
That's what gay people would say.

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,600
He looks so funny though.
Like when he's saying it,

170
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,010
it's just.
It looks like it's fake.

171
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,050
That's one of those things like this is 
not real.

172
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,260
This is part of this simulation that 
it's bullshit.

173
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,500
That video is one of the funniest videos
is quite hilarious.

174
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,610
It looks like a Saturday night live 
skit.

175
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,380
He can get away with it because he's 
gay.

176
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,470
Gay people have so much more leeway to 
say gay stuff.

177
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,540
You know?
Let's call everything gay because it's 

178
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,250
gay to him,
to him as gay.

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,680
To him it is like gay porn.
But do you think,

180
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,710
do you think there's a huge percentage 
of people that aren't into the UFC that 

181
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,280
go?
I agree man.

182
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,620
A bunch of guys rolling around.
So what?

183
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,560
Who Cares?
I wouldn't be upset at that guy.

184
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,570
I mean I think that guy helped the UFC 
here.

185
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,850
Let's play.
Let's play.

186
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Let's do it because it's so fucking.
His name is Daniel Donald Rolling

187
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,130
around on top of one another.
Trying to dominate each other just in 

188
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,950
case you don't know that's gay porn with
a different ending

189
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,580
else says,
keep going.

190
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,110
I won't describe the ending for you,
but as I've gotten older,

191
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,050
the endings are less important.
Okay,

192
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,110
so take a delivery.
The timing,

193
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,100
the aggression and the violence of what 
that was did not make me necessarily 

194
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:23,861
comfortable but can kind of agnostic.
Then we had a colleague here was brought

195
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:30,200
before the committee and I've enjoyed 
this week discussion about our rules.

196
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,850
God,
he couldn't be gay.

197
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,510
I think John Waters off the bolts.
I enjoyed our conversation.

198
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,330
Sometimes these processes work.
What happened?

199
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,990
We had a colleague here who was deeply 
offended by what this was deeply 

200
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,020
offended.
It was like the Christians to the Lions 

201
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Roman time.

202
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,290
It pauses.
You don't see why people think that 

203
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,100
because they get deeply offended by 
something.

204
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,120
They should be able to change what other
people enjoy or they should be able to 

205
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,260
take freedoms away from people.
Especially when you talk about something

206
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:09,261
that's been already licensed and 
regulated by 49 out of 50 states that 

207
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:15,531
this guy could say,
I'm offended and then I feel like this 

208
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:15,750
is like the Christians in Lyons kiss 
what dummy.

209
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,180
First of all,
there's two problems with that.

210
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,300
The Christians didn't have a choice and 
the fucking lines didn't have a choice 

211
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,751
and it was to the death and they didn't 
train for it and it wasn't like a huge 

212
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:31,131
dream of theirs and it couldn't be a 
hugely profitable career where you can 

213
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,331
make Ronda Rousey conor mcgregor type 
money and nate diaz money now to our 

214
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,080
friend Nate Diaz is rolling in cash now.

215
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,950
Roland balling out of control.
He might not.

216
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,190
He might not fight again.
He might beat his ass again if they 

217
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,981
fight and then like take two years off 
and he's making millions of dollars or 

218
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,650
not be connor's ass.
Who knows,

219
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,460
right?
I mean connor convenient.

220
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,030
Just slap them the way I just had a 
feeling going into that fight.

221
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,670
I was like,
this is a big difference.

222
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:04,671
There's a big difference too,
and Nate Diaz strikes in anybody else 

223
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,660
that connor's fought like natives real 
slick with his hands.

224
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,290
He's real good at shoulder roll and he's
got a Nasty Jab.

225
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,170
He drops his hands and sneak stuff in on
you.

226
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,760
He knows how to throw punches too with 
like minimal minimal wind up.

227
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,820
He knows how to pop hop you and those.
Dang you man.

228
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:25,821
They fucking.
He dings guys on the Chin like what he 

229
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:25,821
did with Michael Johnson.
I was like,

230
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,220
Ooh,
this is a tough fight.

231
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,220
And he's a tough out.
The only guys ever stopped him is Josh 

232
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,670
Thomson had kicked him and when Josh 
Thompson had kicked him,

233
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,890
like he's still didn't go out.
He got rocked,

234
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:37,930
but he's fucking tough man.
I was like,

235
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,570
Ooh.
And if it goes to the ground,

236
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,880
oh,
that's the wrong guy.

237
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,580
Nate Diaz is the wrong guy to go to the 
ground with.

238
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:48,960
He's a legit black belt,
a really high level black belt.

239
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:53,961
And I knew connor had gotten submitted 
by Joe Duffy when anybody can get 

240
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:57,621
submitted if you get caught,
but he got submitted by that Joe Duffy 

241
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:00,310
Guy.
Just a few years ago and Joe Duffy is a 

242
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,310
very talented fighter,
no doubt about it,

243
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,650
but nate wouldn't have got submitted by 
that same guy.

244
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:03,940
I highly,
highly,

245
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:07,480
highly doubt it.
I mean those San Joe's like that,

246
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,880
that level,
like there's a few guys were like,

247
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,910
Ooh,
if you submit that guy like he's only 

248
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,701
been submitted in the USC dosantos wants
and that's because he had a broken jaw 

249
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:17,701
and it's clay.

250
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:18,660
Guido submitted them because clay was on
top of them,

251
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:23,661
squeeze in his neck and his jaw was 
smashed and he realized he was really 

252
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,020
fucked and so he tapped.
But like a guy like conor,

253
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:30,040
if you've been tapped before by Joe 
Duffy just a couple of years ago with an

254
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,180
arm triangle,
you get caught like that.

255
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:36,181
Like you've got a lot to learn and I 
don't know if you've learned and all in 

256
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:40,081
time,
like you got to be obsessed with 

257
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:40,081
Jujitsu.
You gotta be in there every day training

258
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:41,800
and I didn't think he did.
I didn't think he was that.

259
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,920
I thought it was more of a movement and 
it's striking and all that stuff.

260
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:49,000
And I know he was doing some Jujitsu,
but it's not like the primary focus.

261
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,420
So I felt like,
Ooh,

262
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,320
that's a big deepened fucking Jew.
He might knock them out.

263
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,780
I mean connor can knock out anybody,
but he didn't,

264
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,640
you know.
So now that he didn't.

265
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,670
And now that nate knows he didn't,
and now they're going to go into the 

266
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:02,860
second fight and nate's going to have a 
full training camp.

267
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,840
Oh,
good luck.

268
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,540
What's the benefit of this second fight 
for conor?

269
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,760
Just to.
That's what I thought.

270
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,010
Money outside of that.
Is there any good?

271
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,720
Well,
he could always go down to 1:45

272
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,760
again.
He's still a champion at 1:45,

273
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,910
but the amount of money and Nate Diaz,
conor mcgregor makes conor mcgregor 

274
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,500
rematch makes is going to be off the 
fucking charts.

275
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,980
Nate Diaz is a superstar and people 
didn't realize it until like the Michael

276
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Johnson fight.
People realized it when he was calling 

277
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,470
out connor in the in the octagon and 
everybody was cheering and also like the

278
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,660
ratings when Nate Diaz,
he's a fuck,

279
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,920
you know,
there was a big thing we're Dana white 

280
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,390
had said that he's not a needle mover is
when they were in the middle of contract

281
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:49,420
negotiations.
The couldn't be further from the truth.

282
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,370
He's a big needle mover.
I Love Dana,

283
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:55,730
but that's just contract negotiation.
Talk like Nate Diaz.

284
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,090
Maybe he didn't know.
I mean it's possible he didn't know,

285
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:03,091
but I know because of the Diaz brothers 
as far as like my friends that are like 

286
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:03,400
casual mma fans.

287
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,040
The Diaz brothers are fucking huge.
They're huge.

288
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,050
Those guys are giant stars and after 
nick like pretended to sleep with 

289
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,000
Anderson Silva and like their big talk 
mad shit,

290
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:17,500
they,
they actually can fight.

291
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:22,501
They fight very good.
I mean they're excellent world class 

292
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:25,861
fighters and they talk mad shit and they
smoke a lot of weed and they mostly eat 

293
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:29,290
vegan.
Like I think nick might be all Vegan.

294
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,350
I think dick still eats like fish,
but I know nate eats fish and I think 

295
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,820
they eat eggs to the tortillas and stuff
that's made with eggs and them,

296
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,560
but they're interesting guys.
Man,

297
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,800
they're there.
They're fucking legit,

298
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,210
fascinating people.
So like there's money.

299
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:51,211
My point is that guy's out of his mind.
This isn't a Christian versus the lions 

300
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:52,250
is a huge support that these guys are 
giant

301
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,650
stars.
They make it fucking boatloads of cash.

302
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,860
Ronda Rousey was on the God cover sports
illustrated with one of those paint 

303
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,850
things on paint titties.
How's that?

304
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,020
Okay.
How's that?

305
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,600
Okay.
Can I pick.

306
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,170
Paint my cock.
I can.

307
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,180
If I pay my cock and I go out there,
is that all right or is it make it look 

308
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,770
like an elephant or chicken or 
[inaudible]?

309
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,370
There's a line there,
right?

310
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,340
It's like a woman's nipples.
You cannot show a woman's nipples on the

311
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:17,900
cover of the magazine,
but.

312
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:22,901
Well,
how come you can show them painted on 

313
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:22,901
like why do we decided to paint on is 
okay.

314
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:23,780
Like when you're looking at.
Right.

315
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:27,050
There is a naked Ronda rousey with a 
fake swimsuit on.

316
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,300
That's so cool.
So like her vagina.

317
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,170
I'm assuming like most girls,
you could see some of it from the front,

318
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,480
right?
Can we spit?

319
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,340
Can we zoom in on the not do that.

320
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,590
Let's be respectful here for her sake.
And for Travis Browne say,

321
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,100
because if he finds you will fucking 
kill you.

322
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,170
Oh,
it's a cool thing though.

323
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,690
That's like a cat.
They had to look a cat design.

324
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,720
I didn't notice that.
That's good because at the bottom could 

325
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,061
be a hairy chin.
See there they thought about that in 

326
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:55,730
advance.
She had to probably Tuck in some lip.

327
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm guessing.
Maybe not,

328
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,780
man.
Maybe she's one of those tidy girls.

329
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,570
I don't know.
Is that rude?

330
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:04,640
Is it rude to say?
But my point is I'm.

331
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,660
Rhonda knows I love her.
My point is I can do that with my cock.

332
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,010
Oh my God.
That's so cool.

333
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,220
You know what I'm saying?
Like I could wear like I could get a 

334
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,230
full on,
hard on and put Lycra on,

335
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
put like spandex on and put it online 
and people would say I was offensive.

336
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,810
Right.
But it would be okay.

337
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,280
Like that was what the game did.
Do.

338
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,900
Remember that Jamie or rap fan?
I remember that.

339
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,210
He had an instagram posts.
Yeah,

340
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,500
he put an instagram,
but he's a.

341
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,680
he's got a hog.
Like a fuck up police flashlights took a

342
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:39,860
picture of him standing there with a 
fucking boner.

343
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,750
Oh,
they wouldn't even show it in this.

344
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,530
Some of them.
There was one that chose it got in 

345
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:47,730
trouble.
Jesus stopped doing it,

346
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,720
but he's holding onto it and one he's 
warming it up.

347
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,020
And then number two is just showing it 
there.

348
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,810
I mean,
to be honest,

349
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,320
even as a guy,
that's scary.

350
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,980
He's a large person too.
He's a large human,

351
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,280
so that's like buddy can't fight it is a
video of him a beaten some guy up and 

352
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm like,
oh dude,

353
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,020
we need to work on some stuff with you.

354
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,610
We need to work on your technique.
I mean,

355
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,290
he could fight,
but he can't.

356
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,530
He doesn't know like how he doesn't know
actual techniques like Katt Williams 

357
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,740
fight.
He's not as good as Kat Williams.

358
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,950
Cat defended the choke.
If you notice that when they went to the

359
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,840
ground,
cat never got strangled.

360
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,200
He held on,
he had two on ones.

361
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,860
What you're supposed to do,
and the way he threw that left hand,

362
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:35,861
I got to say there was zero power behind
and it probably wouldn't knock out my 

363
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:38,900
seven year old,
but there was no fat in this technique.

364
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,770
Like he didn't wind up.
He just uncorked it from here and it was

365
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:47,771
a straight punch.
He uncorked a very short straight left 

366
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:49,380
hand with a ring onto which is like a 
deadly weapon.

367
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,310
When you see the extended

368
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:55,310
version of the video,
it definitely seems like he was 

369
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,351
threatened.
It seemed like that kid was up in his 

370
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:57,351
face.
He followed him for whatever reason.

371
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:58,890
That's unfortunate.
The kid apparently said,

372
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,230
Kat Williams is funnier,
you know,

373
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:03,450
whatever.
Why,

374
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,210
why?
You know,

375
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,520
why do people want to do that?
Like,

376
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,990
why is it you want to do that?
It's Worldstar.

377
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:07,770
That's what it is.
Yeah.

378
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,290
It's got to do them Worldstar hip hop.
We got to play the full version.

379
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,910
So you're,
here we go.

380
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,970
The kid gets this,
use this version.

381
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:16,740
It looks like he's just fighting with a 
kid.

382
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,640
See,
but how come we miss all the other stuff

383
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,200
up until this got very good control?
Actually.

384
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,490
Nope.
Terrible defense.

385
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,260
I'd take it back.
He was already choked out.

386
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,290
He didn't go to the hands.
Oh,

387
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,700
that's not his hands.
He's got one.

388
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,980
Okay.
It doesn't have to on one.

389
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,520
He's not holding the choking army there.

390
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,840
It's called little boy.
Little boy.

391
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,510
And they were playing soccer on a field 
or something like that with a looks like

392
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,950
20 people or something like that.
Shirt on.

393
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,550
It doesn't look like a disc.
Imagine that.

394
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,560
That'd be good.
We should photoshop one and all of the 

395
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,560
photos with him and then online.
What?

396
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,890
What,
what,

397
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,440
what,
what,

398
00:18:55,441 --> 00:19:00,441
what,
why was he playing soccer with some 

399
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:00,441
kids?
How about why not?

400
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:03,300
If he wants to be friendly.
I mean Katt Williams is a gigantic star.

401
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,740
The end.
He's just saying he was hanging out with

402
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,300
people in the hood and this is why most 
people,

403
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,980
most celebrities don't come and hang out
in the hood.

404
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,980
So he was just hanging out with this.
That's unfortunate.

405
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,370
It looked like there was definitely some
confrontation going on,

406
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:18,300
but who knows how the fuck has built up 
to that and you've got to expect that,

407
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,100
especially if he's involved in sports 
playing sports or people put people play

408
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,180
sports,
they talk shit,

409
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,600
you know,
that choke on the subway here in culver 

410
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:29,600
city was way better GC.

411
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,820
That one was better,
but even then why is that guy grabbing 

412
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:33,820
his forearm like that?
Like,

413
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,280
dude,
don't grab like that.

414
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,300
That's not how you do.
I mean someone like that's like some 

415
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,320
wrestling type shit,
like a wrestling sleeper hold.

416
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,230
But he did it right.
I mean he,

417
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,340
he squeezed that guy out and he wasn't 
a,

418
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,390
he's just a normal guy.
He wasn't like a Jujitsu guy or a fight 

419
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:49,390
or anything like that.
He was just a normal dude.

420
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,220
Dexter Dexter.
No kidding.

421
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Oh,
it does seem weird that that Jujitsu 

422
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,390
moves like choking and stuff like that 
seems so common now since the UFC a like

423
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,950
you didn't see this shit 20 years ago.
People doing jokes,

424
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,090
but when high school we had a sleeper 
hold like because it was on progress 

425
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:10,500
line,
but we didn't think it was real.

426
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,940
You know,
you'd hear about the sleeper.

427
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,330
He's got that slave buyer,
you know,

428
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,680
guys would get guys in a sleeper hold in
a pro wrestling match and then they 

429
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,041
would fight it off and fight it off and 
eventually would go to sleep and the 

430
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,921
ref,
we'd pick their arm up to make sure 

431
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:24,921
they're awake.
You remember that?

432
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:24,921
Yeah.
That was.

433
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:28,521
But we didn't think it was real.
Like no one knew that you could really 

434
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,700
choke someone out until the UFC came 
around.

435
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,320
You can't do that anymore.
In Highschool,

436
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,070
Kenya,
there's no more sleeper.

437
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,080
No,
that was not in wrestling rest.

438
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,760
It was only in pro wrestling.
Like in wrestling,

439
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:43,761
wrestling.
You couldn't even do a full Nelson 

440
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:43,761
because it puts too much pressure on the
neck.

441
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:46,430
You could do like a half Nelson,
so if you're trying to pin someone,

442
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,980
what that means is if you were behind 
them,

443
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,220
you get an under hook and you go around 
the back of their head and you get now 

444
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,450
full Nelson is you have both arms and 
it's a bad place to be.

445
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,350
It's.
It hurts.

446
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,330
You could push down your neck and they 
made that.

447
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,000
They made that illegal when I was in 
high school at least.

448
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,300
And so like if you wanted to pin someone
you had to use a half Nelson so he could

449
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:09,301
never do a fucking sleeper hold,
but there's like some shit they didn't 

450
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,690
know about that you can do.
Like Matt Hughes choked out.

451
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:14,020
Ricardo Almeda with just a front 
headlock.

452
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,290
What he did was he held onto the front 
head lock.

453
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,280
He had an Matt Hughes is fucking country
strong.

454
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,560
Like there's some dudes that grow up 
working from the time they're young like

455
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:30,130
lifting bales of Hay and learning how to
use their body.

456
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,160
And also he had excellent genetics too 
because his brother was built like that 

457
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,160
too.

458
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,500
But there's some strength that those 
type of guys have like farm strength,

459
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,720
that Shit's no joke,
man.

460
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,980
Like there's a lot of Kettlebell guys 
like Pavle Tot souly,

461
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,890
he,
he's got that kind of bill to where it's

462
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,110
like,
you know that if you try to wrestle with

463
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:55,111
him,
he even though he looks like a fairly 

464
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:55,780
normal size athletes,
probably just stupid fucking strong.

465
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,530
And so Matt Hughes gets his front head,
ca headlock on Ricardo Medo right.

466
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,560
That,
that is a legal wrestling move that's 

467
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,951
fucking legal as far as I know,
unless they've changed shit because all 

468
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,521
he's doing is grabbing his neck and he's
using his head and his neck to squeeze 

469
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:17,170
the shoulder and arm of Ricardo Almeida 
against his neck on one side.

470
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,320
And then he's using his arm and his 
shoulder to squeeze the neck on the 

471
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,881
other side.
So it's essentially the same thing as a 

472
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:26,881
head and arm choke.

473
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,470
He's just in a different position.
So like he's in the north south position

474
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:31,990
from a standup,
which means they,

475
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,330
he grabs his head and he pulls him down.
And Matt's.

476
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,390
Matt's got the upper hand is his arm is 
wrapped around Ricardo's neck now they 

477
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,291
were reversed on the ground.
That position where Ricardo is being 

478
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,980
choked is essentially the same as a head
and arm choke,

479
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,130
which is a super common choke and you 
finish it the same way with the hand 

480
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,580
grip and the same way you get easily 
finish it that way.

481
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,070
Some guys grabbed the Bicep,
but the way matt is doing it,

482
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,160
a lot of guys finish it that way so he 
would be different like he would be 

483
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,091
mounting them where his body would be on
top of his body instead of like in a 

484
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,060
north south position,
but it's essentially the same.

485
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,320
Same way you're applying pressure to 
choke someone unconscious.

486
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,460
We had never seen that in the UFC before
nor since no one's been able to do it 

487
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,951
since.
My point being like there's some 

488
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:17,800
wrestling shit that they still out there
that you could still do,

489
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,900
but guy like Matt,
he choke you out with Mark Schultz.

490
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,940
Got He got kicked out of the Olympics 
because he ripped a guy's fucking 

491
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,220
shoulder apart with a a move that was 
legal at the time.

492
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,580
It was like a Kimora.
He they call a double wrist lock and 

493
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,000
catch wrestling,
but if you pull up Mark Schultz,

494
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,290
I forgot the gentleman's name,
the guy wrestled,

495
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,470
I want to say he was from Iran.
Iran has a very strong wrestling 

496
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,270
program,
but Mark Schultz was all fucking go real

497
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:51,980
law when he was competing as he's the 
guy that Fox catcher movies based on,

498
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,510
but meanwhile not really based on him.

499
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,650
I mean it is and it isn't.
They played fast and loose with a lot of

500
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:02,651
facts,
made it look like he was gay and he's 

501
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:02,651
doing coke and he had frosted tips and 
all kinds of weird shit in there.

502
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,290
But that move as far as I knew,
he just took it too far or something I 

503
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,110
think,
but I think it was an illegal move.

504
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,460
Here it is.
Watch this,

505
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,400
watch what he does.
He drops,

506
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,260
it,
gets to Kamora.

507
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,100
He Yanks it.
A pulls them down.

508
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:19,600
Just destroys his arm.
Just destroys them.

509
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,020
Yeah,
and the guy's just screaming in agony on

510
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:27,680
the ground back in the day.
ABC Wide World of sports I think,

511
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,820
wasn't it?
They don't have that shit anymore.

512
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,920
Remember?
Used to get exposed to weird sports.

513
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,340
Yeah.
They would take you to like a javelin 

514
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,340
contest.
Like ABC wide world is ports.

515
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,170
They would show you all kinds of 
different shit that you'd never seen 

516
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,170
before.
Like they had a Minnesota Plat.

517
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:49,000
Fats play,
Willie Mosconi in a pool match an ABC 

518
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,150
wide world of sports.
Like Whoa,

519
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,110
I'm going to show us some cool shit 
today.

520
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,340
I saw vr pool demo the other day.
Like that five thing I showed you a 

521
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:01,411
couple of weeks ago.
Someone was made of a full pool game 

522
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:02,320
where you're walking around a pool hall 
and a you can set up,

523
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,060
you can set up a bunch of trick shots 
with looks.

524
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,090
It looks a little gaming,
but you can have like beer bottles and 

525
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,420
whatnot on the table and shoot your pool
balls right through the bottles and.

526
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,570
Huh?
I saw at best buy there's this new 

527
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,960
camera out that's only like $400,
but it's a three 60 camera,

528
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:21,961
which so you could just put it right 
here and it records everything around 

529
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:21,961
it.
Have you seen this,

530
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:24,220
Jamie?
I don't know if it's good or not,

531
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,050
but uh,
that's kind of interesting.

532
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,070
It is interesting.

533
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,590
I mean it's just a matter of time.
Whoa.

534
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,440
This is bizarre.
Also,

535
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,310
it's showing you the angles and stuff

536
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,820
so you can just walk around if you want 
the English you can,

537
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,090
but everything in the whole room is 
available at the touch apparently or a 

538
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,190
certain extent.
That's cool.

539
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,300
Let's set up ramps.

540
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,650
Well,
what will be really interesting is if 

541
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,800
you could somehow set this up with other
people and have virtual balls,

542
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,320
but the problem is you wouldn't feel the
ball,

543
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:59,321
like the whole idea pool,
like see what they're doing is just 

544
00:25:59,321 --> 00:25:59,630
showing the shots,
like landing the shots,

545
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,680
but with pulls really all about is 
controlling the rotation of the ball and

546
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:04,520
cue ball control.

547
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,020
There's a little feedback,
a little bit of touching yet,

548
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,550
but if I don't know if they could make 
it feel to say never.

549
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:09,910
You would

550
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,950
need wait.
Yeah,

551
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,470
like what?
What pool is,

552
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:17,471
is like a,
there's a big thing about it is the 

553
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:17,471
weight of the queue.
Like um,

554
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:21,900
guys will change their weight just a 
little bit and they feel it in a big 

555
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,501
way.
Like they'll go from a 19 point one 

556
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:25,501
ounce q,
two in 19 point three and they're like,

557
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,130
man,
I'm over stroking this ball.

558
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:32,131
I got to back off.
Like we were talking about like two 

559
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:32,560
tenths of an ounce and it's a big 
difference in the way it feels.

560
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,410
Or if you go from like one ounce,
one ounce is giant,

561
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:37,630
you go from a 19 to a 20,
holy shit.

562
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,180
That's a big difference for people.
You would think like one ounce,

563
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,460
like how,
how would you even notice you hold it in

564
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:44,040
your hand after a you wouldn't even 
notice right

565
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,750
now.
You notice notice in a big way.

566
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,550
So that's.
I don't know if that would work,

567
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,570
but some shit would work on.
I think once they figured out how to do 

568
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,260
like some sort of a neurological input 
thing,

569
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,030
then you're going to be able to play on 
a computer.

570
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:03,031
You're gonna be able to feel the keys,
you're going to be able to like if you 

571
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:03,350
pull vault,
you'd be able to feel the poll.

572
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,540
It will be able to feel the breeze as 
you go launching through the air.

573
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,810
All that stuff's gonna happen.
Video game version of you on UFC two is 

574
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,771
so creepy.
Awesome that I love it and it just the 

575
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:18,621
idea of.
Imagine taking that version of you by 

576
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:22,340
mixing the podcasts with it.
You probably could do something like 

577
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,340
that.
It'd be so real.

578
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,580
Well,
I know why I did that.

579
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:26,490
I got out of doing more commentary to do
that.

580
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Commentary is a commentary and a video 
game is painstaking and it's one of the 

581
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:34,680
easiest thing.
See,

582
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:37,320
that's me from my new ketogenic diet.
I'm all shredded now.

583
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,650
I'm the a guy that beat every single 
player using you.

584
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,110
That's two hours sitting while talking 
like doing like a podcast while he's 

585
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,110
playing you.
That's hilarious.

586
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,090
So cool.
And it's real like you hid that from all

587
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:54,090
of us to like none of us knew about 
that.

588
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,180
No,
I didn't tell anybody I was supposed to 

589
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,761
be quiet about it.
So I had to take off my clothes and put 

590
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:03,350
shorts on and then they,
um,

591
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,440
they spin it like,
you,

592
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,920
you stand totally still and you have to 
go through a series of poses.

593
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,240
And so like,
uh,

594
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,140
like your hold your arms out like that.
You'll hold your arms out like that.

595
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:16,080
You do certain movements.
I don't think I had a kick.

596
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,140
I don't think I had to throw any kicks.
I'm trying to remember now.

597
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,500
But your kick in the game looks like 
you're kicked.

598
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,310
It looks good.
It looks pretty real.

599
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,070
It looks all well they did the 
techniques.

600
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,680
They've all analyze the techniques for 
like,

601
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,170
like did Jujitsu techniques.
They're all super good.

602
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,600
The wrestling techniques,
boxing and kicking.

603
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,240
It's all like really good fundamentals.
Like everybody,

604
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:39,150
even guys who have like wonky 
fundamentals in this game,

605
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:44,151
their fundamentals are really good.
They did such a good job also of really 

606
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:47,130
making the experience this time around.
Like just like the ring girls walking in

607
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:48,630
the background,
just like everything.

608
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:53,631
It's like creepy.
How good they did a creeping the live 

609
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:53,631
experience.
It's getting better and better.

610
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,620
They're getting so good at this shit,
you know,

611
00:28:55,621 --> 00:29:00,621
they're,
they're getting close to what they call 

612
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:00,621
that uncanny valley.
The crossing that uncanny valley.

613
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:00,710
That's,
that,

614
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,720
uh,
that's an expression that someone came 

615
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,671
up with the difference between 
artificial videos and videos of like 

616
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:11,220
this and three d video games and then 
real people like when I did that,

617
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,930
a Scifi show,
the questions,

618
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:17,931
everything show we went to Nvidia and we
saw the latest in their ability to 

619
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:20,910
recreate a person's face and they still 
had problems with,

620
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,920
um,
with tongues.

621
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,820
Tongues were a big one and hair and some
hair.

622
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Just an eyes like eyeballs where your 
eyeball connects to your eyelashes and 

623
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,190
your eyelid.
That looked a little funky.

624
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,540
But everything else,
man,

625
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:41,541
they'd still,
he did it with a bald guy and a fuck 

626
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:42,010
dude.
It's fucking crazy.

627
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,910
When you look at it,
you're like,

628
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,670
that's not a real guy.
Wow.

629
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,720
Like,
it's so close.

630
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,560
They're so close.
They're like knocking on this door where

631
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:55,561
they're going to be able to recreate 
things and you're not going to be able 

632
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,291
to know whether or not you're watching 
something that's completely computer 

633
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,961
generated or something that's real,
and they did something recently that I 

634
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:05,251
tweeted a couple of days ago or maybe 
yesterday where this guy superimposed 

635
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,560
his facial expressions on George Bush 
and so like he got,

636
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,790
he said things to put words in a George 
Bush's mouth at George Bush.

637
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,150
Never said so they show the video.
That's cool.

638
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,240
Yeah.
It's so awesome.

639
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,980
It's creepy,
dude.

640
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:20,380
We were not going to know.
We're so close.

641
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,080
That's probably already happened.
He 100 percent.

642
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:24,490
Right?
Like blurry shit.

643
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,030
You're just not going to know.
You're just not going to know what's 

644
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,030
real and what's fake.

645
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,850
You just won't know.
Yeah.

646
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:33,460
There's going to have to be like seals 
of approval or something like that.

647
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:36,220
That's like we're saying that this is 
real editor is going to be.

648
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,570
Videos are going to be like stories,
so you're not going to know whether you 

649
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,941
told me some crazy story.
I'm not going to know whether or not 

650
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:44,941
it's real.
I'm like,

651
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,911
all right,
you say so that's what a video is going 

652
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:50,401
to be like.
Like you're watching this video of 

653
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:52,261
George Bush.
It's going to be like someone telling 

654
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:52,261
you a story about being abducted by a 
Ufo.

655
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:52,261
Alright,
where's your proof?

656
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,860
Well,
I'll show you the video,

657
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,530
right?
Everyone's going to like,

658
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:58,000
get out of here.
What your fucking video.

659
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,120
That video can be fake as hell.
You could have made that on your phone 

660
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,860
with the face swap APP and shit that's 
on the phone that even.

661
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,810
That shit's crazy.
And that's just a little stupid program.

662
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,950
How about the ones when they put tongues
on people like us doing this,

663
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,720
that is so crazy and he's obviously 
exaggerating.

664
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,750
He's making like big smiles and weird 
side decide motions with his face just 

665
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:26,800
to show that they could do that.
But I guess how it works is they take a.

666
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,150
yeah,
all they're showing it right here.

667
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,920
They take a three dimensional moving 
video of this guy's face.

668
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,490
And um,
as he's moving around,

669
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,610
they take a three dimensional image of 
the other person's face and they map out

670
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:46,801
where his mouth is.
And what the shape of his mouth is and 

671
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:49,981
they just have that guy's mouth do the 
movements of the other guy is just 

672
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:50,460
crazy.
Cool.

673
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,060
The smiles are off though.
If you see like Putin smile like Donald 

674
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,390
Trump's looks fake as fuck because he's 
got such a weird mouth.

675
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Like his range of motion in his mouth is
like an old lady trying to do the 

676
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,230
splits.
You know what I mean?

677
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:07,690
In his mouth doesn't move very much.
He's got a small mouth.

678
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,930
Donald trump.
What a crazy technology.

679
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,660
It's nuts.
Well,

680
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:16,780
they did this with Reagan way back in 
the day with audio.

681
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,560
There was a thing where someone had 
taken a series of Ronald Reagan's 

682
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,880
speeches,
remember that?

683
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,920
And they edited the audio to show the 
know for Ronald Reagan to make some 

684
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:33,820
ridiculous statement.
I forgot all about that old school.

685
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,220
It was old school and they played it on 
tv and we're like,

686
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:41,221
whoa.
I remember watching that going well 

687
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,870
Nancy remix,
Ronald Reagan's speech went viral years 

688
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,050
before Internet memes and that was a 
long ass time ago.

689
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,080
You know what else went viral?
Richard Gere in the Journal Story.

690
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,110
That's the real viral treatment.
Taco Bell,

691
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,280
I don't know what that one is that 
people come,

692
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,780
they come in,
it's somebody eight come from a Taco 

693
00:32:59,780 --> 00:32:59,780
Bell Burrito or something like that.

694
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,680
Did I guarantee that happened?
But the Richard Gere durable thing was a

695
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,890
much better example because it's a story
that Eddie Bravo heard.

696
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:08,870
He grew up in California.
I grew up.

697
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:13,871
I heard it in Boston.
We heard on the other side of the 

698
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:13,871
country.
I mean this,

699
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:14,680
this fucking store.
Everybody knew you heard it right?

700
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,780
I almost think it was a Howard stern 
thing,

701
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,180
was the scientology thing.
Supposedly.

702
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,250
That's the rumor.
The rumor was Richard Gere and left 

703
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,760
scientology.
Scientology decided to fucking drag them

704
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,310
through the mud.
Wow.

705
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,100
Yeah.
Well,

706
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I think scientology does not like it 
when you leave and that's why people 

707
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:37,160
stay like the people that have left.
They fucking go after you,

708
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:42,161
man.
They go after you hard and the people 

709
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:42,800
that that do leave,
most of the time they just shut the fuck

710
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:47,801
up,
but the people that have left that have 

711
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:47,801
talked shit about them.

712
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:51,200
Whoa,
wait outside your house to fucking make 

713
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,681
noise.
They'll follow you around like those 

714
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,321
videos of um,
these guys getting harassed that were 

715
00:33:56,321 --> 00:33:59,711
former scientologist and now the 
scientology crew showed up at their 

716
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:03,911
house and they filmed these people.
They don't understand like how creepy 

717
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:03,911
that is to us watching that,
like,

718
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,270
what you win me,
you can't leave,

719
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,480
like you can't quit and if you do quit 
you,

720
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:10,340
you can't talk about what happened.
Like what are you guys doing?

721
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,660
Like,
what are you guys doing that we can't 

722
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,901
talk about this?
Like what kind of nuttiness do you 

723
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:19,721
really have kids working for fucking $3 
an hour and you make them work 16 hours 

724
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:23,711
a day and you have like,
like that guys was his niece or 

725
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:24,660
something like that.
Uh,

726
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:29,661
David miscavige guy like one of,
one of his relatives released book and 

727
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:33,260
she's talking about how fucking crazy it
as growing up in this environment.

728
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,870
Like you can't talk about that.
Well,

729
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,380
as soon as you can't talk about 
something,

730
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,650
you know you've got a real problem 
because you can talk about being a 

731
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:41,650
baptist.
You could,

732
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,060
you could talk all day about growing up 
in a Baptist church.

733
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,590
No,
but nobody's going to fucking come after

734
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:47,510
you because they're not doing anything 
crazy.

735
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,830
You know what I mean?
I mean,

736
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:53,120
even though it's a religion to you,
as soon as you can't talk about what you

737
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:55,160
guys are doing,
like you can't.

738
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,350
Someone can't complain about what you're
doing.

739
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,960
I mean think about that.
Applied to the Catholic church,

740
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,100
you know,
it's uh,

741
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:09,490
it seems like that day's coming though 
when that shit gets exposed to being 

742
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,150
something cosby,
like we're going to find way more about 

743
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,840
scientology or Tom Cruise or any of 
these,

744
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,020
all these people maybe.
Um,

745
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:23,021
I mean think,
I think it's definitely gonna be harder 

746
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:23,021
for them to get people to listen.

747
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,680
You know,
it used to be easy.

748
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,780
You just,
before the Internet,

749
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,810
you just had to have like a bunch of 
successful people that are part of a 

750
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,200
group that were really friendly and you 
want it to be a part of it.

751
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,640
You wanted to get in there with them and
the next thing you know,

752
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:36,770
you have thousands and thousands of 
members.

753
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:38,670
It wasn't,
it wasn't hard to do back then.

754
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,860
But now like you don't have to wait 
until you're 10 years in,

755
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,440
find out about the fetus and the fucking
planet,

756
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,500
where the bodies are,
are they fucking drop them into the 

757
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,851
volcano and they're frozen or whatever.
Like if you read the actual story that l

758
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:59,850
Ron Hubbard wrote as detailed in,
um,

759
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,150
in that going clear moving where the guy
first read it and he was like,

760
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:06,900
what in the fuck is this?
You can get that now.

761
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,220
So it's harder to get people to join now
with something like totally wacky.

762
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,110
But there's some other shit.
Like,

763
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,690
what is landmark?
People keep telling me,

764
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:18,960
this landmark you've ever heard of 
landmark theaters?

765
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,820
No.
Jesus Christ.

766
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:24,090
Jamie just hanging out with him.
No,

767
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,060
there's some,
there's some fucking,

768
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,770
some sort of a cult.
Is it,

769
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,670
am I saying the name wrong?
Mark?

770
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,740
There's like a,
there's another type of social group 

771
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,430
that a bunch of people were tweeting me 
St ever seen the Robin Quivers,

772
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:44,280
isn't it the landmark forum?
Yes,

773
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,400
that's it.
And people are saying that this is some 

774
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,400
sort of

775
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,980
cult.
Is that bullshit?

776
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,680
Like what is it?
Some self help thing,

777
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,150
is that what it is?
It's just a message board.

778
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,360
No form is a large group awareness 
training program in which a hundred up 

779
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:03,180
to 150 people take a seminar together 
aimed at helping them realize their true

780
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,520
potential.
That sounds like something.

781
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,640
Yeah,
sounds like one of those self help

782
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,340
guru things,
which may be okay.

783
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,800
I mean,
are any of those legit.

784
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,760
I mean Anthony Robbins is pretty fucking
legit,

785
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,270
right?
I mean people have used as principals 

786
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:24,370
and they've gotten ahead and that guy 
has been around forever.

787
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:27,160
So if he was a total bullshit act 
creeper,

788
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,520
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

789
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,850
You would have heard about it by now

790
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,250
maybe.
Wow.

791
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:37,290
I mean look at Bill Cosby,
like maybe it was like a way less level 

792
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,680
creeper,
just like just just gives massages to be

793
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,880
appropriately.
It doesn't take it any further than 

794
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:46,880
that.
But Guy,

795
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,711
he's just a foot back.
He just gives like an unannounced back 

796
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,010
rubs.
Just shows up,

797
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,460
starts rubbing your back.
And there was like,

798
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
um.
Does he go any further that?

799
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:53,800
Nope.
Nope.

800
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,710
He just gives you the weird back rub and
that's it.

801
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,990
You know what's weird is when I.
I got this watch,

802
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:05,320
I got the Apple Watch and when you're 
setting it up it says male,

803
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,740
female or other and I like that.
Welcome to the new world.

804
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,230
That could be another.
I'm a fox kin.

805
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,340
Is it on there?
Because if it's not,

806
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:16,150
I'm fucking complaining.
I'm going to sue apple and Foxconn.

807
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,170
What's Foxconn?
Spirit animal.

808
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,460
My spirit animal is a Fox.
There was a guy who fucking got his 

809
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,650
license at the DMV in Portland and they 
let him wear a Fox hat,

810
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,780
like a fake,
like Fox,

811
00:38:28,781 --> 00:38:29,320
like a,
like,

812
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,560
like a furry wood where we had like,
no,

813
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,190
like he had like a Fox eyeballs for 
like,

814
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,780
look,
there's a photo.

815
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:42,781
See if you could find the photo of him 
at the DMV getting his fucking 

816
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,320
photograph.
And everybody's like,

817
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,390
well that's ridiculous.
Is it?

818
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,820
Is it any more ridiculous than.
What's that thing that Muslim women 

819
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:51,820
wearing head.
Good job.

820
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,660
Good job.
Yeah.

821
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:54,130
Look at this guy.
This guy.

822
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,990
Wow.
Fucking Fox at.

823
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,030
Ah,
what's his name?

824
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,040
Edgard Campuzano.
Is that his name?

825
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,490
Down there.
Yup.

826
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,310
No,
that's the guy who wrote the story.

827
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,310
How they was the gentleman's name.
We need to give him props.

828
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,560
What's his name?
Just as Portland,

829
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,530
man.
Come on,

830
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:20,290
man.
Says Bishop Bishop Bishop,

831
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,640
what's his name to his bishop?
Said his name is bishop.

832
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,140
Oh really?
It goes by bishop.

833
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,770
Oh,
okay.

834
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:27,760
Well that's good.
Even better.

835
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,440
It's one day.
He's like Oprah.

836
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,050
His name was bishop.
Pull it up so you can see the photo.

837
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,410
Do you think that's just his girlfriend 
worked at the DMV?

838
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,660
I bet that's more about.
Well,

839
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:46,490
it took time to grow that beard.
Look at that beard.

840
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:47,440
He's got it.
That's a weird,

841
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,000
funny Fu Manchu style.
Long,

842
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,460
long like goat beard.
You know,

843
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,940
he's got one of those like,
uh,

844
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,630
have you ever seen a Turkey beard?
Turkeys have this weird thing.

845
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:01,270
They grow out of the middle of their 
chest is like this long beard.

846
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,880
It looks like some.
And the longer it is,

847
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:06,740
the older the Turkey is.
So it becomes like a,

848
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,220
I guess a part of the way they struck.
They were that big Turkey things weird.

849
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Um,
so that's like they let the other 

850
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Turkey,
no bitch,

851
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:16,760
I been around,
look at all these fucking metals.

852
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,090
I got Leno,
like as it grows,

853
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,100
that's what that guy has got,
got grown off his chin.

854
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,720
So it's highly possible.
He's out of his fucking mind that,

855
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,770
that dude looks like the Oregon,
Oregon people look like kind of like the

856
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:31,830
Oregon state bird almost.
Well,

857
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:35,680
why shouldn't I be able to live a little
able to wear that Fox hat because it was

858
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:38,770
a girl at south south by southwest who 
was a fencer.

859
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:43,950
She's a competitive fencer and she 
wanted to wear a full head garb and the 

860
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,250
photos and they were like,
no,

861
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:50,251
you have to take that off.
And so south by southwest had to 

862
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,820
apologize because they asked her to take
her religious clothing off.

863
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,910
Well,
this guy should go to south by southwest

864
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,920
where it's fucking Fox hat.
We should all do that because it's all 

865
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:58,920
ridiculous.
It's all ridiculous.

866
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,841
Like any clothing that you have to wear 
and you have to take your photos with 

867
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:05,740
that clothing in order for you to be 
free,

868
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,800
like the eastern religions made up.

869
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,900
Okay,
so any clothing that you wear,

870
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:15,610
any like fanatical garb that you wear 
when you go somewhere that's made up?

871
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:17,440
Shit.
So if that's made up shit,

872
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,240
you should be able to say you're Fox 
can.

873
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,580
You should be able to say you should 
feel aware octopus on your head.

874
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:23,320
Everywhere you go.
There are reasons you're not supposed to

875
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:24,470
have anything on your head because 
you're.

876
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,500
You have to see what you look like with 
no,

877
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,050
you know what you look like normal,
like base.

878
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,900
So if we're looking for you,
we know your security.

879
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:35,990
There's a reason why you have an idea in
the first place because there's a lot of

880
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:40,670
people like if you put on like a face 
mask,

881
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:43,770
like a skier,
where's where it's like it shows you a,

882
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:48,790
like from the eyebrows up is covered and
from the mouth down is covered.

883
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,720
Fuck man.

884
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,220
You could be a million different people.
It's so hard to tell who you are without

885
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,190
seeing your whole face,
the shape of your head,

886
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:00,200
the color of your hair,
the whole deal.

887
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,740
There's a lot of people that look 
fucking similar as hell and so to have 

888
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,101
an id in the law allow someone to wear 
some really elaborate costume where your

889
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:14,330
most of your heads covered and you say 
you do it because of your religion.

890
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,920
Like,
no,

891
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,460
no,
like they're apologizing to her because 

892
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,750
of the wacky rules that she follows.
Don't allow you to show your head like,

893
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:28,040
get the fuck Outta here.
It's 2016 folks.

894
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,110
I mean,
come on.

895
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,030
What point in time?
Like the religious tolerance,

896
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:33,980
it's so important.
Religious tolerance.

897
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,190
It's we have to be tolerant.
Unless they're Christian,

898
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,430
their Christian,
you could shit right in their mouth and 

899
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,591
you could make the sign of the cross 
with your shit on their forehead and no 

900
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:44,591
one cares.

901
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:48,620
Like that's the one religion where it's 
totally okay to mock openly and make fun

902
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:52,310
of nobody because you think you're a 
goof ball.

903
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,670
But if you wanted to walk into a south 
by southwest with a,

904
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:03,110
uh,
a pope hat on because you said that's 

905
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,340
part of your religion.
I'm pope and training and I'm really low

906
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:05,530
level right now.
But uh,

907
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,980
I'm just going to stick,
you know,

908
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:12,030
like you are what you believe you are.
So I'm just going to wear this 

909
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,030
everywhere.
I'm gonna.

910
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:16,380
Wear a giant with a fish head one.
The big one where it looks like an open 

911
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,380
mouth.
A fish mouth.

912
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,330
No,
we need tolerance.

913
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,060
We need Tawana's appeal though.
He got to keep his head.

914
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,140
Yes,
he should be.

915
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,660
He totally shaved.
He should get to keep it.

916
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,020
And that's why I'm going to.
I'm gonna wear a Bandana.

917
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:32,130
Like pirate.
I'm going to say I'm a,

918
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,400
I'm a pirate.
Light weight.

919
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,940
I'm tired as fuck.
I'm going to wear.

920
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:38,000
My pirate is fuck a caveman coffee tea 
tee shirt.

921
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,560
Did you see the whole Kogan was the only
guy to win a court case with a do rag on

922
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:43,670
in court.
Excellent.

923
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,850
You made him a classy.
The Black Bandanna to go with is a black

924
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,260
suit.
I thought it was a classy look.

925
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,400
And I'm a big fan of his.
Now they want $150.

926
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,740
Million plus if you want another 25 
million.

927
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,800
See that?
Yeah,

928
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,280
they're on top of the post was at 
Gawker.

929
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,960
Was I going out of business now?

930
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,170
How we're cheering,
what I thought would they have unlimited

931
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:11,171
money?
Just being dicks to guy making videos 

932
00:44:11,171 --> 00:44:12,500
has to pay $10 million or something of 
his own money.

933
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,670
Yeah,
but he's like super rich.

934
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,390
Apparently it's going to cost them 10 
million bucks,

935
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:20,090
but he's got like $100 million.
The whole thing's hilarious.

936
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:26,110
His hair cut is so awesome.
Look for him like this is a win win.

937
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,590
I mean this guy's.
He's theater hulk.

938
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,880
Hogan is theater.
Everything is theater.

939
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,840
Did you hear the part?
And as that are in the questioning about

940
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:39,480
is a 10 inch penis that he said his hogs
not as big as the games.

941
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:46,190
The game,
the game doesn't even have to go to 

942
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,631
court.
It's like look bitch know how big my 

943
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:47,631
dick is.
A fake Dick.

944
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:52,610
The only thing they could do is they'd 
have to have some sort of a deposition 

945
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:52,610
with pulled it out,
shows you.

946
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,710
But he might be a shower and not a grow 
or a grower and not a shower.

947
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,010
So like he might have to get worked up 
to prove it or you're completely right 

948
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:01,980
or it's just fake.
He just grabbed some girls Dildo,

949
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:06,981
put it in his shorts,
take a photo just to make everyone go 

950
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:06,981
home and go to the copy.
You have a ticket.

951
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:06,981
I've done.
Seems connected.

952
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:11,620
Well that's you though.
You got to understand your unusual and 

953
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,180
it's not.
It's connected.

954
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,330
Like is the Dick is connected to them.
Like if you look at it,

955
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:17,010
it's obviously like it doesn't look like
a.

956
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:22,070
If it was a Dildo,
there'd be like a dropoff point at the 

957
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:22,070
base and you're like,
wait a minute.

958
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,310
How exactly is this thing attached?
You know what I'm saying?

959
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,260
What they have,
the ones that you stick onto the side of

960
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:27,600
the wall of the shower maybe just went 
like on his.

961
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,610
Should be.
Could be like he talked,

962
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,790
he talked and had that one too.
But even if he stuck it in,

963
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:37,791
it would be going forward.
It wouldn't be off to the side like 

964
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:37,791
that.
When you have spandex,

965
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,390
he probably just put it to the side.
It's one of those long double ended.

966
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:42,540
Once you know that the long snake one,
it's not connected though.

967
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,200
I.
Look,

968
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:44,400
I,
I stared at his dick.

969
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:49,401
Very careful and from what I'm seeing,
it's a real dick.

970
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:52,530
And it goes with his body.
You know what I'm saying?

971
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,160
It's not like Tony Hinchcliffe as a 
fucking oatmeal box in his pants.

972
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,930
So that's quaker oats box.
Somebody had the expression for it.

973
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,490
Somebody had that description I thought 
was the funniest description ever.

974
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,550
Quaker oats box for a dick.
Well,

975
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,700
who is,
he's holding it even looks like him.

976
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,500
This is another one that's even faker.
Um,

977
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,530
no.
That looks like he's fully hard to deck 

978
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:15,530
guys.
Giant.

979
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:15,750
It's got a giant Dick.
Come on,

980
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:17,100
sign.
You know that Shit's real.

981
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,970
You want it to be real?
No,

982
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,530
I'd want.
I'm scared.

983
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,690
She,
that could just be.

984
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:29,770
Oh,
look how he's got marijuana leaf 

985
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:29,770
tattooed right above his dick.
Like,

986
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,120
what's that supposed to mean?
Smoke it,

987
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,360
smoke it.
If he got all the hashtags he has on 

988
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,121
there on his body will change your life.
Drops.

989
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:39,900
Mike.

990
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Restructure your day.
This dick can keep them edges slicked 

991
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,670
down.
This dick can file your nails.

992
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,940
This dick.
This tongue will make you late for work.

993
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,860
Wait,
this dick can be your best friend.

994
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,790
This dick console and bundles.
I'm not sure what that means.

995
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,310
If you can.
I'll eat a pussy.

996
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,350
You can take the whole thing.
Can you not?

997
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,490
If you can't,
only Hashtag.

998
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:15,150
If you can eat your pussy.
I'm till scandal.

999
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:19,650
Comes back on next week and what the 
fuck?

1000
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,870
He's funny.
Dick.

1001
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,810
Game strong.
I love that.

1002
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:29,980
I love this world.
Somebody

1003
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
figured out a way to distribute 
information through fucking pipes and a 

1004
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,760
numbers.
It's decoded back into letters,

1005
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:39,520
ones and Zeros and this is what it came 
to.

1006
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:41,820
Hashtag Dick.
Game strong.

1007
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,610
That's been used for.
It's being used for.

1008
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,250
Oh God,
what a beautiful world.

1009
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,700
I love how communication has churned 
like into animated gifts and hashtags 

1010
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,100
and it's amazing.
It's so funny.

1011
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,930
We live in funny times,
man.

1012
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,080
It's funny,
like the amount of funding that we get 

1013
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,270
in a daily basis is like way higher than
when we were kids.

1014
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,640
Like just all these hilarious animated 
gifs.

1015
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,640
Anytime anything goes wrong or anything 
happens in the world,

1016
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,120
these fucking things are hilarious and 
most of them would be made by regular 

1017
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,520
folks.
Have a funny idea.

1018
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:20,610
They're not being made by professionals,
which kind of shows you what we have 

1019
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,361
said all along.
It's just a lot of funny people out 

1020
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:25,150
there that don't ever do anything about 
it.

1021
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,250
You know,
they don't ever become like,

1022
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,400
look,
Eddie Bravo is one of the funniest 

1023
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,040
fucking people I've ever met in my life.
He's hilarious.

1024
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,730
But until he started doing our podcast,
most people just knew him as a Jujitsu 

1025
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:38,730
instructor.
I'm like,

1026
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,620
Eddie Bravo is fucking funny.
Like standup comedian.

1027
00:48:41,621 --> 00:48:43,300
Funny.
But he was built.

1028
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,000
He was busy with a bunch of other shit 
and never pursued it,

1029
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:48,860
but he actually did a couple of times.
I remember he.

1030
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,360
I thought I heard he was pretty good.
He did well a few times.

1031
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,890
He did like he had nine sets.
He did nine times and I was nine times.

1032
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:02,980
A few of them were like the Hindenburg.
A few of them were like,

1033
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,890
he just wanted to just quit life.
They were bad.

1034
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,870
A few of them were bad,
it just didn't work,

1035
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:12,250
but a few of them were funny man.
There was a few of them that were really

1036
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:14,350
funny and then there was other ones that
were like a little a mix,

1037
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,780
a mix of like really funny and some 
stuff that didn't work,

1038
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:20,050
but man,
it's like everything else in this world,

1039
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,390
it seems way easier than it is.

1040
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,840
It just does.
Like you look at bowling.

1041
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,420
Okay.
Just grabbed that stupid ball and roll 

1042
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:30,420
it.
How hard could that be?

1043
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,710
Obviously it's hard because you know 
they have pros like they have 

1044
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,890
tournaments,
they play on tv,

1045
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:38,240
they roll the ball better than the other
people rolled the ball.

1046
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,250
Just like subtle nuances.
They will.

1047
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,570
They have special shoes.
They slide when they released the ball,

1048
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:48,571
they have gloves and they spin the ball 
as they release it and they wanted to 

1049
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:52,021
hit that front pin.
That's perfect way and it seems so 

1050
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:54,280
fucking easy if you're outside looking 
in the outside in,

1051
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,130
at bowling you but shit,
I can fucking do that.

1052
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,380
But if you've never bowled in your life 
and you go out and try it,

1053
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,820
Holy Shit,
are you going to be bad?

1054
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,220
Right.
Same thing with everything,

1055
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:08,221
man.
Everything you name it it all things 

1056
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:08,221
that look easy.

1057
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:11,650
Like that fucking gay guy talking about 
gay porn with a different ending.

1058
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,920
Do you think his speeches are.
That's not easy.

1059
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,200
Like what that guy's doing the way he's 
doing it,

1060
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,050
even though it's silly and gay and he's 
got jokes thrown in there.

1061
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,690
Like it's fucking delivery is pretty 
goddamn smooth.

1062
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,180
It's pretty funny.
That's funny.

1063
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,440
Like,
and he knows what he's doing.

1064
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,140
Like he how he's being perceived.
He's adjusting.

1065
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:33,080
He's pausing in the right way.
He's saying it the right way.

1066
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,320
You take the average person,
you make him stand up and give a speech 

1067
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,741
about mma in front of a bunch of other 
people in suits in some room like that 

1068
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:45,800
and it's going to suck.
He's got a built in joke though.

1069
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,890
Everybody knows he's gay.
Like all he has to do is talk about guys

1070
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:53,891
being hot.
Like they'll do that to disarm the 

1071
00:50:53,891 --> 00:50:53,891
situation.

1072
00:50:53,891 --> 00:50:56,830
Like gay guys have that built in thing.
They can always talk about guys being 

1073
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:56,900
hot.
Well,

1074
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,960
it's very hard for me to concentrate up 
here with all these hot guys in the 

1075
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,891
room.
Like he'd say things like that and then 

1076
00:51:05,891 --> 00:51:07,780
boom,
they break the ice and people start 

1077
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:07,780
laughing.
So there's,

1078
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,710
there's that.
But it ain't easy man.

1079
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,530
So Eddie tried it and it just was too 
much time.

1080
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,500
He was busy with his music.
He's busy teaching.

1081
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,710
He's busy competing at the time.
He still competing so he quit.

1082
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,530
He didn't wanna do it anymore because it
was right around the time when he fought

1083
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,920
and fought and Abu Dhabi,
it was right around when I was trying it

1084
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:26,210
out,
but he could do it.

1085
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,700
Especially now because he's been 
teaching for so long.

1086
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:33,701
He's getting really comfortable with 
talking in front of people and in his 

1087
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:33,701
classes.

1088
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:37,900
He's really funny.
Like sometimes in his classes he'll say 

1089
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,120
hilarious shit.
Just not planned out.

1090
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:39,590
Not Jokes he wrote,
he'll just,

1091
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:42,320
something will come up and he'll say 
something or you know,

1092
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,060
sometimes it's like his classes are 
hilarious.

1093
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:49,061
Like one time he came in,
he was talking about some Ufo 

1094
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:51,431
documentary that he saw me.
He said,

1095
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:55,020
oh,
Jesus stopped with the chem trails.

1096
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,720
It was talking about Kim Charles the 
other day.

1097
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:02,010
It still know he's still doing.
They some new documentary documents that

1098
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,130
they're approving over La.
They were putting spraying over the last

1099
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:11,130
couple of months told you that they've 
never not admitted to to doing it.

1100
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,120
But hold on a second.
Here's the difference.

1101
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,460
What they have admitted to and what they
do.

1102
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:21,461
We talked about this before.
What they do an Abu Dhabi on a regular 

1103
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:21,461
basis is they do cloud seeding.
Yeah.

1104
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:26,170
Cloud seeding is absolutely real.
And what they do is they figure out how 

1105
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,470
to make it rain and they spray some sort
of silver iodine.

1106
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:33,510
Is that what it is?
Find out what the fuck they spray to 

1107
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,510
reflect it.
No,

1108
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,510
no,
no,

1109
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,510
no.
That's the,

1110
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,160
I don't know,
hockey shit.

1111
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,040
The uh,
the silver stuff somehow or another,

1112
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:40,580
when you spray it in the air,
it coalesces.

1113
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,640
That's the wrong word.
It somehow or another attracts these 

1114
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,160
clouds to form and that you can make it 
rain.

1115
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,400
And Abi Dhabi,
they've made it rain once a week for a 

1116
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,940
year.
They make it rain there like once a week

1117
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:56,000
they just fucking spray the Scott and 
the desert,

1118
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,390
silver iodide potassium iodide.
That's it.

1119
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:04,690
Which by the way is absolutely a 
different substance than what these 

1120
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,770
people are claiming is in these chem 
trails.

1121
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,930
That was the problem with doing that 
show.

1122
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,320
Like that Joe Rogan questions.
Everything show like the people have 

1123
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,800
some shit in their head and they don't,
they,

1124
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,500
they just.
This is what they believe.

1125
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:22,640
It's locked in there and they don't want
to accept other information.

1126
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:26,100
Like this one guy that made this 
documentary on chem trails,

1127
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,330
I mean he had made two documentaries on 
chem trails and he said he had evidence.

1128
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:35,331
He had evidence.
We have tested the water and the water 

1129
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:36,970
shows high levels of aluminum.
Like why is there aluminum in the Wa?

1130
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,820
Well,
it turns out,

1131
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:43,850
first of all,
that dirt all across the world has 

1132
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,670
aluminum in it.
It's really common.

1133
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,730
It's one of the most common things 
you'll find like as far as like a 

1134
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,090
metals,
like it's super common for aluminum to 

1135
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:53,090
be in the ground.
That's how they get aluminum.

1136
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:53,730
Okay.
It's in the ground.

1137
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:58,731
It's all over the place.
And when this guy showed me his 

1138
00:53:58,731 --> 00:53:58,731
paperwork,
he's like,

1139
00:53:58,731 --> 00:54:00,820
I'll show you the tests.
He hands me this paper and I.

1140
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,260
and it says sludge.
So I said,

1141
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:05,310
well why is this a sludge?
And he goes,

1142
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,480
I don't know,
but I gave them water.

1143
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,820
I go,
but that's not what it says at the lab.

1144
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:11,370
They tested it and they said it's 
sludge.

1145
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,820
So what is sludge?
And he goes,

1146
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:17,010
well I don't know what his slides.
Well let's Google it.

1147
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,720
Sludge I think is water mixed with shit 
and water and dirt.

1148
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:23,040
That's what sledges.
So I go,

1149
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:28,041
okay,
so you admit that dirt has aluminum in 

1150
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:28,041
it,
right?

1151
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:28,740
Yes,
I know that.

1152
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,930
Okay.
But this water did not have dirty,

1153
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:33,870
but it says sludge,
which means water and dirt.

1154
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:38,430
So your water and dirt tested positive 
for water and dirt.

1155
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:43,990
Like that's what happened.
Like your sludge tested positive for 

1156
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,100
being dirt.
That's it.

1157
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:49,550
Did you.
You didn't prove that they're spraying 

1158
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:49,550
shit in the air like this is crazy.
Not only that,

1159
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:54,181
if they sprayed shit in the air,
it would look different than fucking 

1160
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,231
clouds.
Like what a cloud is is moisture here 

1161
00:54:57,231 --> 00:55:01,400
moisture and when you have a certain 
amount of condensation in the air and 

1162
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,490
you send those fucking jet engines 
through it,

1163
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:07,670
it spirals and it's got all this massive
power and heat and it changes the 

1164
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:11,580
temperature of the air in those funnels,
those tubes,

1165
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,550
it creates artificial clouds like,
I'm not making this up.

1166
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:19,550
This is all science.
Like the scientists have figured this 

1167
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,161
out fucking decades and decades ago.
This is like this is a beaten into the 

1168
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:26,691
ground subject.
They absolutely know that you can do 

1169
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,391
that is this is 100 percent proven that 
you can send a jet engine to certain 

1170
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:30,480
levels of condensation and people are 
like,

1171
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:33,000
well,
how come she turns on and turns off?

1172
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,950
What?
Look up in the sky.

1173
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,450
Do you ever notice that clouds aren't 
uniform across the entire sky?

1174
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:44,630
You know why?
Because moisture's not uniform across 

1175
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,301
the entire sky,
just like you'll be fucking driving and 

1176
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:48,810
it'll be raining in one area and he'd 
drive to another area and you could pass

1177
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:51,650
through an area where it's not raining 
and into a new area.

1178
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,160
It's raining again.
You're laughing.

1179
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,280
Oh my God.
We drove from the rainy part into the 

1180
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:58,280
fucking drug part.
You can do that.

1181
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,210
Everybody knows you can do that.
So why would you not assume that the air

1182
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:03,090
in the sky would be very similar?
Sometimes.

1183
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,120
Sometimes it's not.
Sometimes it is like this is.

1184
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,120
This is a dumb theory,
like there's a lot of fucking conspiracy

1185
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:13,200
theories that everybody should look into
is a lot of them that are legit as fuck.

1186
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:18,201
There's a lot of false flags.
There's a lot of lying to the American 

1187
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:22,671
people.
The fucking Gulf of Tonkin that got us 

1188
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,281
into Vietnam's based on bullshit and 
operation northwoods hundred percent 

1189
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:30,510
bullshit and lies all the shit that 
fucking William Randolph hearst did to 

1190
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:31,870
get marijuana illegal in the reefer 
madness.

1191
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:36,871
There's a lot of real life conspiracies,
but as soon as you start believe in 

1192
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:40,720
something and you're unwilling to accept
evidence that you might be wrong,

1193
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,950
it becomes a fucking problem and people 
get mad at me on twitter like,

1194
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,720
Bro,
look at this youtube documentary.

1195
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,350
Look at it,
you do it.

1196
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,580
It doesn't mean people haven't sprayed 
shit in the sky before folks,

1197
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:55,840
but when you're looking at those goddamn
trails that happened behind jets,

1198
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:00,370
that is normal.
That is just what happens when you fly a

1199
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:02,780
jet through the atmosphere and that's 
not.

1200
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,620
People should be worried about the 
fucking jet fuel.

1201
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,150
That's what they should be worried 
about.

1202
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:12,390
Everybody that lives around airports,
they all get like high rates of 

1203
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,440
respiratory illness.
This was just like a real scandal there.

1204
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,740
That's the the real scandal.
If you live near an airport,

1205
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,320
you're breeding that fucking burning jet
fuel.

1206
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,290
If you work at an airport,
if you wanted those baggage handlers,

1207
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,030
one of those dudes is on the strip every
day.

1208
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,030
Fuck man.
What are you breathing in every day?

1209
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,240
Like that's a real.
Like there's real health concerns there.

1210
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,460
Do you know what?
How,

1211
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:32,920
how?

1212
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,320
How,
what a big deal it would be if we really

1213
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:40,321
found out the government was spraying 
stuff and the sky above us and for what 

1214
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:40,840
reason?
What are they doing?

1215
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:45,900
Is it mind control?
Because it's not working is to try to 

1216
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:45,970
make everybody ill.
That's not working either.

1217
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,470
Topics so much doors.
Me and adorable subject.

1218
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:55,471
It's adorable.
You know we're going to find out the 

1219
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:55,471
planes that crashed into the World Trade
Center,

1220
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:58,510
work a crop dusting at the timer,
doing chem trails.

1221
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:03,460
There's something that'd be funny if we 
combine conspiracy to do this.

1222
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:04,780
People who don't even believe they're 
real plain.

1223
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:05,980
Yeah.
I know.

1224
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:11,040
There's people who think that those were
holograms and then they'll show you in 

1225
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,040
video.
Look,

1226
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,871
you can see there's a pixelation on the 
left wing people.

1227
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,120
Their brains are broken man and it's 
because they're not getting any 

1228
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,120
postings.
That's kind of a good point.

1229
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,120
Where you guys are talking about just a 
little bit ago,

1230
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,860
like video at some point won't be enough
evidence for proof.

1231
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,280
Well,
I think it's right now.

1232
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,580
I think it's real close.
I think rule right now we're looking at 

1233
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,250
some normal shit that's showing us and 
Youtube ads,

1234
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,700
but in the darkest halls of justice,
who knows what foot governments 

1235
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,540
government back in the Justice League of
America,

1236
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:47,550
fucking Superhero compounds and Xavier 
President of Xavier or Professor Xavier,

1237
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:51,970
I think the highest levels of all this 
stuff like,

1238
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:53,860
you know,
like that magic leap shit.

1239
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:59,070
Like we're,
we're looking at what they release and 

1240
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,351
we're watching these little videos 
they're putting out and it looks cool 

1241
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:01,351
and everything like that.
But we're,

1242
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:05,041
we're just,
we're getting the consumer version of 

1243
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,131
the report,
like the people that are working on it 

1244
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:10,581
at the highest level where you have to 
go to their office and sign 

1245
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:10,581
nondisclosures and shit like that.
Like,

1246
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,350
like I went to um,
the nvidia offices.

1247
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:16,360
And when you go in there and they show 
you all your stuff,

1248
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,040
you can't,
you're not supposed to.

1249
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:23,370
Like,
you can't like take videos of it other 

1250
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:23,370
than the,
they allow you to,

1251
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:27,340
they'll show you some stuff,
but they released their stuff very 

1252
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:27,530
carefully.
You can't give out the specifications of

1253
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,900
how they make their things.
And because it's all,

1254
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,570
there's a big technology,
race is constantly on,

1255
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,870
you just get assigned non disclosures 
for any of these things.

1256
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:37,570
Now when you do,
um,

1257
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,280
motion capture for a video game or any 
of those,

1258
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:45,310
those things to people,
they make you sign all this paperwork 

1259
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:45,310
and shit.
It ain't that easy.

1260
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:49,570
So the people that are at the highest 
level of creating the CGI effects,

1261
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,420
we have no idea like how good they are 
right now.

1262
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,580
They're,
they get better every year.

1263
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:01,180
So like if we go to like one of them,
CGI labs does shit for movies and see 

1264
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,500
how good that stuff looks better to blow
you away.

1265
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,630
Yeah,
I'm sure it's been happening for awhile.

1266
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,450
I was,
I'm sure there's shit that we don't know

1267
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:08,780
about.

1268
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,520
We'll think about the movies that come 
out.

1269
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:12,890
Right.
Those fucking movies like Jurassic Park,

1270
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,290
the new Jurassic Park,
which was insane.

1271
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,750
It wasn't a good movie.
It was kind of goofy movie,

1272
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:22,430
but it was an insane showcase for like 
full state of the art,

1273
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:27,580
Cgi Shit that's available right now.
Like the dinosaurs looked incredible 

1274
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,830
like that took like how long I think to 
make over a year.

1275
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:35,831
I'm sure.
So that's the technology that was 

1276
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:35,831
available when they first started doing 
that project.

1277
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:36,860
So like what is,
whatever it is,

1278
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:38,420
two years ago,
let's say two years ago,

1279
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,000
what can they do now?
What can they do in five years?

1280
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,100
I go to this,
we're showing us.

1281
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,260
Jamie's popped off.
This is called the climb.

1282
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,000
It's a mountain climbing.
Oh,

1283
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:48,800
that thing.
Oh my God.

1284
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,870
You no hands your arms.

1285
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,560
Yeah,
just have hands it shows you.

1286
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:57,561
But the way that they've,
the scale on what you see when you get 

1287
01:00:57,561 --> 01:01:01,311
up to like climbing the top of the 
mountains and the amount of detail they 

1288
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,450
put in here so you can like put your 
face all the way up to your hand and see

1289
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,530
the stitches in the gloves.
They look,

1290
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,000
it looks.
I saw a little more of an explanation on

1291
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:09,480
it,
but uh,

1292
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,170
it seems like why would I want to do 
that for fun?

1293
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Well,
I've watched those youtube videos was 

1294
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,670
crazy Russian dudes that do cartwheels 
on rooftops and there's so many of those

1295
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:20,500
guys.
Yeah,

1296
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:21,980
that one guy,
James Kingston.

1297
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:24,070
I think he's scary.
Oh,

1298
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,930
he's terrifying.
Been top the top of the tallest building

1299
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,720
and was just climbing on a crane and 
doing handstands for fun.

1300
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,190
Well,
he also does leaps.

1301
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,530
He'll lead from the top of one building 
to the other,

1302
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,550
uh,
key showed one.

1303
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:39,551
He's still in the corner of this 
building and leaped across the street 

1304
01:01:39,551 --> 01:01:43,480
and landed on another building.
Like these guys are serious fucking 

1305
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,530
athletes because even the ways landing 
like he's,

1306
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,770
he's like stiff legged it,
like planted himself.

1307
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,540
He does not he shit man.
But Hey,

1308
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:58,541
we're talking about how long for that 
guy becomes Jello one day.

1309
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,230
Right?
So he's looking across here.

1310
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:05,231
He's going to jump all the way there.
He climbed that thing.

1311
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,240
Oh Dude,
why?

1312
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,280
Oh my God,
I can't do it.

1313
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,620
Oh my God,
this guy's out of his mind.

1314
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:13,490
So,
uh,

1315
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:15,190
James Kingston.
And what's the name of the video?

1316
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,070
People want to watch this.

1317
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,980
That's same gap to off 150

1318
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,170
meter high south tower.
Christian jumping.

1319
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,000
Where's he jumping?
Jumping from here.

1320
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,920
Come on.
No,

1321
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:26,220
no,
no.

1322
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:27,330
He's not going to.
Oh my God.

1323
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,500
He's going to jump.
What do you going?

1324
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:31,380
What is he going to do here?
I can't watch this.

1325
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,320
Theater.
Sweat.

1326
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:39,020
There's some new drones that just came 
out recently that you're going to be 

1327
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:39,020
able to make some way cooler videos and 
he's making now.

1328
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:43,731
Even he's.
He's takes his fucking shirt off while 

1329
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:47,001
he's up there folks.
It's going to leave it up there and he 

1330
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:48,450
tucked it just so everybody knows.
It's up there forever.

1331
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:53,930
Everybody knows he was really there.
If you want to go up there and retrieve 

1332
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:53,930
his shirt,
go get it.

1333
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:53,930
No,
he's not going to jump over to that.

1334
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:54,810
Another thing.
Oh,

1335
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,670
Jesus Christ.
He's hanging.

1336
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:05,010
Fuck Jesus Christ.
Dude.

1337
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,060
Oh my God.
This guy's out of his fucking mind.

1338
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,660
This is so hard to watch.
It's so hard.

1339
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:17,980
It's so hard.
It's so hard to watch when you're not 

1340
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:17,980
there.
Facebook here is this facebook,

1341
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,760
James l Kingston.
He's out of his mind.

1342
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:23,040
Man.
That dude's out of his fucking mind,

1343
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:27,130
but that's how we're talking about.
Just like Alex honnold.

1344
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:27,730
What?
What's.

1345
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,010
Oh,
it's differ.

1346
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:30,960
Hopefully he's getting paid for it.
It's different.

1347
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,210
I guess.
I don't know.

1348
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:35,550
I think what he's both equally crazy.
First of all,

1349
01:03:35,551 --> 01:03:40,500
what he's doing is illegal with Alex 
honnold does is a sport young Jamie.

1350
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,380
I know what Alex does is pretty nice 
too,

1351
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:48,381
but you know,
the climbing dudes like the hardcore 

1352
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:51,291
climbing guys,
they fall into one or two camps when it 

1353
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:52,800
comes to Alex.
either they revere him or they,

1354
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:57,830
uh,
they think he's a real problem and they 

1355
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:57,830
think he's going to die.

1356
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:58,030
Like there was this one documentary they
did about a more,

1357
01:03:58,031 --> 01:04:03,031
uh,
one of those pieces that he did about 

1358
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:04,581
them were,
they talked this one old school climber 

1359
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:04,581
who uses ropes and the whole deal and 
he's like,

1360
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:06,870
it's not a matter of if he's going to 
die,

1361
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:12,050
it's a matter of when.
And the guy was just like being a real 

1362
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:14,340
negative about it,
which I don't understand is because when

1363
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:19,341
I watch a guy like Alex Honnold,
I say obviously he knows what the fuck 

1364
01:04:19,341 --> 01:04:23,721
he's doing.
He's doing it all the time and he 

1365
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:26,661
continues to do it all the time.
So why do you assume that one day he's 

1366
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:27,900
going to have a mental lapse and not be 
able to do it?

1367
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:28,830
Well,
he can do it.

1368
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,510
Is he doing it?
He's doing it right.

1369
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:32,280
He's doing it okay.
Well if he's doing it,

1370
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:33,360
he can continue to do it.

1371
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:36,540
The less his handbrakes unless he gets 
old,

1372
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,780
unless he stops working out.
I mean why,

1373
01:04:38,781 --> 01:04:43,781
why is he not going to be able to do it?
Well one day he's going to fall like 

1374
01:04:43,781 --> 01:04:46,470
what are you hex in him and putting the 
fucking the Kibosh on him.

1375
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,520
What are you doing?
You know,

1376
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:51,000
you don't know he's going to fall like 
what he's doing is very dangerous.

1377
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:56,001
But he might do it forever.
He might be able to do it until he's 80 

1378
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:56,280
and then quit.
He might know what he's doing.

1379
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,530
You know?
I mean,

1380
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,630
he goes over those courses with a rope 
first,

1381
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:04,800
he knows he's got a path,
like he doesn't just climb something and

1382
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:09,801
hope he could figure out how to get up.
He goes through these things with ropes 

1383
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:12,480
first and then once he goes through the 
things with ropes,

1384
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:16,650
he sees his path,
he marks it and it goes even even still,

1385
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,150
I guess what?
Why

1386
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,160
are they think it's bad that he might 
die doing it because it shows other 

1387
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,041
people that on a bad path to take on 
exactly the reason why they think it's 

1388
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:28,390
so bad.
Well then we should stop having Nascar.

1389
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:29,340
Yeah,
for sure.

1390
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,500
Things you can do that will kill you 
that aren't even that dangerous.

1391
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,600
Yeah.
I was watching a girl yesterday on the 

1392
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600
fucking highway at night wearing 
sunglasses,

1393
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,250
scrolling through her facebook in the 
law in the left lane.

1394
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,380
The far left lane,
people were honking.

1395
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:44,720
Is there a passenger?
She didn't give a fuck.

1396
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:49,930
She's fat.
She's probably eating while she was 

1397
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:51,050
driving to big fat face.
Looking down at her phone,

1398
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,140
scrolling through her pictures,
just careless,

1399
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:59,150
careless American,
just to everything that would be people.

1400
01:05:59,151 --> 01:06:01,120
If they're wanting to mock America,
this,

1401
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,810
she's probably looking at Kim 
Kardashians.

1402
01:06:02,811 --> 01:06:04,970
Instagram,
she had sunglasses on.

1403
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:10,120
She's driving,
were their big overfed face and she's 

1404
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,721
scrolling through putting everyone 
around her in danger because she's 

1405
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:14,420
barely paying attention and she's doing 
the scroll lean.

1406
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:17,090
Here's something that people don't 
realize when they're scrolling,

1407
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,090
if they have their hand on the steering 
wheel and they have their phone,

1408
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,990
they do this where they lean over 
towards their phone.

1409
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,410
So like if you look at her from behind,
uh,

1410
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,590
the first thing I saw,
I'm like,

1411
01:06:27,591 --> 01:06:32,591
why is this bitch gone 60 miles an hour?
I look it over and because everybody 

1412
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:33,620
else was flying by and left and I'm 
right and she's in the left lane.

1413
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,590
She's,
you see the glow from her phone,

1414
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:41,680
which is a big one.
And then her head is like all the way 

1415
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,831
over to the right side.
So this picture is like barely paying 

1416
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:45,500
attention to what she's doing.
I mean,

1417
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:50,120
she barely paying attention and she had 
fucking sunglasses on and it's dark out.

1418
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:55,690
The whole thing was hilariously American
and she probably had a trump bumper 

1419
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:57,530
sticker on.
I have a mount,

1420
01:06:57,531 --> 01:07:00,030
so I just put my ipad pro right in the 
middle of the move to.

1421
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,000
She's probably on her way to Ted Cruz's 
house.

1422
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,470
She's going to go fuck them.

1423
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,610
Have you seen that documentary that.
Hold on,

1424
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:10,680
I'm sorry.
Do you believe that?

1425
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,200
Do you believe it?
Do you know what we're talking about?

1426
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,880
Five women have come out or they said 
five women.

1427
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,420
Ted Cruz is having an affair with five 
different women.

1428
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,720
First of all,
Kudos because you know if you're going 

1429
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:23,720
to have an affair,
go deep.

1430
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,190
Have a gang of them and they said that 
one of them even worked for trump now.

1431
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,470
Perfect.
That's how you do it.

1432
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:33,870
You get to tell you getting deep into 
the enemy lines.

1433
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:34,590
You know,
you gotTa,

1434
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,380
you gotta get a spy.
There's some other things.

1435
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:38,880
I was trying.
I was trying to read up on it.

1436
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,870
There's been a lot of tweets over the 
last six months referring to this thing.

1437
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,900
The thing it's in capital letters.
The thing like Hashtag the thing at this

1438
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:53,031
mate might be it,
what they bill been referring to the 

1439
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:53,031
last time where there might be something
else.

1440
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:53,460
Secret.
Hidden.

1441
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,290
How about of Ted?
Cruz comes out.

1442
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:57,090
Hashtag Dick.
Game strong.

1443
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,470
I'm voting for him for him.
Um,

1444
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,340
he's in.
If he just owns up to it,

1445
01:08:02,341 --> 01:08:04,080
he's in.
Can you imagine?

1446
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,030
Hashtag Dick.
Game strong.

1447
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,750
Bam.
Off fucking vote for him.

1448
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,760
I'll register.
I'll be a registered public.

1449
01:08:11,761 --> 01:08:13,890
I'll go to church.
How about that?

1450
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:17,180
Just to vote for him.
Why?

1451
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,300
When you want our great now,
because I think the whole thing's a 

1452
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,911
joke.
I watched Hillary Clinton yesterday on 

1453
01:08:24,911 --> 01:08:24,911
Jimmy Kimmel.
You see that video now?

1454
01:08:24,911 --> 01:08:29,470
It's hilarious.
Jimmy Kimmel did a really fucking smart 

1455
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:29,470
thing.
Very funny.

1456
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:34,150
He set up this thing where he had 
hillary come on and he told her about 

1457
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:38,261
mansplaining and he asked her if she 
knew what mansplaining was and then she 

1458
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:41,320
started giving her explanation and he 
corrected her course.

1459
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,600
And so then he had her go up and give 
her speeches and he told her how she 

1460
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,370
probably should actually dress and how 
she should talk.

1461
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,850
And he basically mansplained his way 
through the whole thing.

1462
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,220
Can we play this or will this get us 
kicked off of Youtube?

1463
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:56,480
Definitely.
Probably get us kicked off.

1464
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,870
Yeah.
You should just watch it on Jimmy's.

1465
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,620
Yeah.
Well yeah,

1466
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,550
just watch it on his channel.
But if you could find the video.

1467
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:02,310
I uh,
I.

1468
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,760
today is the 20.
What is today?

1469
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:07,730
The 24th.
What is today?

1470
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1471
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,240
I,
I'm 25th.

1472
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,480
I tweeted it today.
So if you get to the 25th and you find 

1473
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:16,850
it on,
it's fucking hilarious.

1474
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:20,930
So I'm gonna have to play it.
I want him to get all the hits for it.

1475
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:21,470
Anyway,
he's,

1476
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,390
he's great.
He's great.

1477
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,440
He's,
I love that guy.

1478
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,170
And the way he did it is just so fucking
brilliant.

1479
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:29,060
Nobody else would have the balls to do 
that.

1480
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:32,720
Like he did it all,
like fake Dick headedly.

1481
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:33,530
But since,
you know,

1482
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:34,640
he's a nice guy,
nice guy.

1483
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,630
He can get away with being a fake Dick 
head.

1484
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,560
It was great.
It almost made her likable.

1485
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,100
Quite.
You're not feeling the Bern.

1486
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,290
I feel the burn more than I feel 
anything else.

1487
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,510
Yeah.
I like burning and I've said this before

1488
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:51,500
because the social stuff,
I think what he represents socially will

1489
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:55,820
be a good like uniting of our country.
I think it'll help us.

1490
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,600
I think what trump,
what he represents socialists,

1491
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:04,601
the thing that disturbs me the most,
like when he says things about like 

1492
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:06,170
Mexicans and that kind of shit,
that's that.

1493
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:11,171
That to me is.
That's the dumbest part about what it 

1494
01:10:11,171 --> 01:10:12,320
does and the people that react to it 
like the go,

1495
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:13,090
Rah,
Rah,

1496
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,560
that get all fucking Rah Rah about that 
kind of shit.

1497
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:19,460
That's the worst aspects of our culture.
We got lucky as fuck.

1498
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:23,570
We got lucky as fuck to be born in 
America.

1499
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:29,350
You could say what you want about where 
you live and you might love Iceland are 

1500
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,861
fucking Sweden or wherever you are right
now and you're listening to this and 

1501
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:32,861
that's.
I bet you're right.

1502
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:33,200
I bet you're right,
but you're what you.

1503
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:37,550
Where you live has great great 
qualities.

1504
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,160
I'm not saying there's anything wrong 
with where you live,

1505
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:45,850
but what I'm saying is the difference 
between being born in America and being 

1506
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:50,531
born in Mexico is fucking staggering.
It's a giant fucking difference as far 

1507
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:57,461
as the opportunities you have as far as 
like the chances of you being able to 

1508
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,300
get a great job and be able to support 
your family,

1509
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:07,540
like people aren't sneaking into America
because it sucks they're sneaking into 

1510
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:11,951
America because they got a shitty roll 
the dice and they got born into a poor 

1511
01:11:11,951 --> 01:11:15,420
family in Mexico,
which is connected to the richest nation

1512
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:16,620
in the world today.

1513
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:21,720
It's that simple.
You and I got lucky as fuck we all did,

1514
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,960
and so for a guy like Donald Trump,
he doesn't recognize that shit like you 

1515
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,330
should.
That should be the number one thing that

1516
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:32,331
he says,
if you want to keep America great and 

1517
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:32,331
you want to make America great again and
everything like that,

1518
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:33,540
we all,
we're all down with that,

1519
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,680
but you can't talk shit about Mexicans.
You can't talk shit about them all being

1520
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:39,630
rapists,
murderers,

1521
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:43,440
than the sheer numbers of people that 
come over from Mexico that are great,

1522
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:48,650
that don't do anything,
that they're just trying to work and 

1523
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:48,990
trying to feed their families while 
they're doing it illegally.

1524
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:54,290
Yeah,
because a lot of other people have done 

1525
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,971
it illegally to and you know,
and they send back money and they 

1526
01:11:55,971 --> 01:11:55,971
suddenly realize there's job 
opportunities here,

1527
01:11:55,971 --> 01:12:00,861
and Donald Trump's fucking home 
companies employ illegal aliens.

1528
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:04,470
His wife came from another country.
I mean,

1529
01:12:04,471 --> 01:12:09,471
the whole Hillary,
that was Mitt Romney had hilarious joke 

1530
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,471
here.
What he said.

1531
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,050
He said,
uh,

1532
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:10,890
it's a,
it's,

1533
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:15,930
there's some jobs that Americans won't 
take trump out of white from and get it,

1534
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:24,930
you know,
that's the product disturbs me about 

1535
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:24,930
him.
But,

1536
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:24,930
uh,
the rest of the stuff,

1537
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:27,290
I liked some of the stuff he does think 
he's Larry.

1538
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:32,540
I'm pretty sure he's going to win just 
because I know for sure in 2020 it's 

1539
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:37,281
going to be trump versus Kanye the way 
our world is going right now.

1540
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,320
It's going to happen.
Just not going to happen.

1541
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,730
He's not really going to run for 
president.

1542
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:42,390
Oh yes,
yes.

1543
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,190
That's a hustle.
That's fake.

1544
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:46,740
That's how you sell cds and what have 
you.

1545
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,540
But don't you think that's where we're 
going?

1546
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:51,780
Especially if trump wins.
Four years later we've bounced back.

1547
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,000
I think we bounced back hard the other 
way.

1548
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:59,270
I think if trump wins,
what happens is you get someone like a 

1549
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:02,151
Gary Johnson,
Gary Johnson who is without a doubt the 

1550
01:13:02,151 --> 01:13:05,421
best candidate,
but nobody takes him seriously because 

1551
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:05,421
he's an independent.
He's.

1552
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:07,410
I mean he's a legit former governor of 
New Mexico,

1553
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:10,710
did a fantastic job there.
He's very open minded,

1554
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:12,360
very liberal,
very progressive,

1555
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:15,450
but also very smart.
I'm fiscally aware,

1556
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,910
like he's got a lot of super positive 
qualities.

1557
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:23,030
He just doesn't want to be a part of 
that bullshit two party system and 

1558
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,030
because of that,
no one's going to take them seriously,

1559
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:26,970
but a guy like Gary Johnson could be a 
real leader in a real president,

1560
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,150
but to be a president is a fucking 
stupid job.

1561
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:35,510
It's to be one person that's in charge 
of so many different parts of this 

1562
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:36,990
country that it's insane.
I mean,

1563
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:40,800
you have to be in charge of how much 
taxes we charge people.

1564
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,000
I mean,
that's part of your platform.

1565
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,600
What's your foreign policy?
What's the military budget?

1566
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:47,520
What's all these things that are like,
what's.

1567
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:50,370
What are you gonna do about healthcare?
What are you gonna do about education?

1568
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:55,371
We,
all of those things require fucking 

1569
01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:00,620
years and years and years of extreme 
study like you have to like really be 

1570
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:04,791
immersed in each individual aspect of 
our civilization to even have a thought 

1571
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:09,960
of how to fix it and correct it and 
change the system whether it's taxes,

1572
01:14:09,961 --> 01:14:11,350
whether it's the economy,
it will.

1573
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:16,351
All these different things require 
incredible levels of expertise in the 

1574
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:20,621
expect that in all these different areas
from one person and then expect them to 

1575
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:25,591
have a unique progressive ideas about 
society and culture and you know,

1576
01:14:26,181 --> 01:14:31,181
and how we move pass over silly 
differences about race and gender and 

1577
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:33,460
sexual orientation.
This person is,

1578
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:35,290
one person would have to be a master.

1579
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,750
They would have to be some guru from 
another planet.

1580
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:43,050
I mean they would literally have to be 
some non human because a human being 

1581
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:47,250
can't have that many levels of expertise
because to be an expert in anything 

1582
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,040
that's like super complicated like 
finance,

1583
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,100
like God damn,
those guys are studying it all the time.

1584
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,520
I mean,
you might be able to be like a really 

1585
01:14:59,520 --> 01:14:59,520
good finance guy and also have a mean 
racquetball game or something like that.

1586
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,340
Say Your Watch freaked me out.
What does it do it my security.

1587
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,180
My home security just went off.
So it vibrates.

1588
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,680
Broken your house.
Now it's just ups guy.

1589
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,460
Oh,
they bang that shit.

1590
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,210
I don't know how to turn it off.
Throw it in the water.

1591
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:19,100
It's probably the best move.
Why do you want a computer on your 

1592
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:19,100
wrist?
You really liked that,

1593
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:19,100
but it's cool.

1594
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,970
I mean they just dropped the price $100.
So it's really cheap.

1595
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,180
Wonder why?
Yeah.

1596
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,300
Well it wants to fucking computer on the
wrist.

1597
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,410
You know what's real?
What's cool?

1598
01:15:26,411 --> 01:15:28,250
It's like when you're driving and 
somebody texts you,

1599
01:15:28,251 --> 01:15:29,500
you just look over and be like,
okay.

1600
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,190
Or you can just push a button and just 
reply about.

1601
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,580
Just drive you.
Fuck.

1602
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,780
Exactly.
That's why I listen to books on tape.

1603
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:44,300
Listen to podcast,
don't you like you are a podcast so you 

1604
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:44,300
don't even listen to.
I know.

1605
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,580
I don't listen to podcasts at all.
That is insane.

1606
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,810
Why?
That's your part of your problem.

1607
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,590
I,
I,

1608
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,890
the only time I ever listened to 
podcasts when I'm going on a road trip,

1609
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:54,880
but not like locally.
Every day I listen to podcasts all,

1610
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,100
all day long.
I listened to history,

1611
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,710
obviously history on fire.
I listened to.

1612
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:01,390
I'm a hardcore history.

1613
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,500
Um,
Daniel,

1614
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:07,050
Daniela [inaudible] and I'm Dan.
Patrick's Annette.

1615
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:09,340
Dan Patrick.
Do you listen to guys we fucked?

1616
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:11,150
No.
How was it?

1617
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:15,480
I just hung out with this girls and at 
south by southwest or Christian has said

1618
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:17,060
it's pretty funny.
I don't know.

1619
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,600
Dan Carlin.
Why am I saying Dan?

1620
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:20,620
Patrick?
Jesus Christ.

1621
01:16:20,621 --> 01:16:22,600
Because I was listening to a Dan Patrick
today.

1622
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,360
Talk to.
Yeah.

1623
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,110
Um,
but,

1624
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,120
so I listened to those guys.
I'm Dan Carlin's the best at hardcore 

1625
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,150
history is insane.
Um,

1626
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:36,210
I listened to some archery podcasts.
I listened to some comedy podcasts,

1627
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:37,710
depending on what I'm into,
you know,

1628
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:42,800
case listen to Joey's.
I'll listen to bill burrs on occasion I 

1629
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:42,800
was to rap.
So it's not always a lot elicited.

1630
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,040
Dunkin's,
do you watch joey on periscope?

1631
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:46,300
I mean,
do you watch periscopes?

1632
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:47,980
I've watched joey.
That's it.

1633
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,910
Sometimes I'll watch brody.
Yeah,

1634
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,940
but uh,
I'm in my car,

1635
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:52,180
man.

1636
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,160
I don't fuck with the phone now.
Nope.

1637
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:59,310
I don't fuck with it.
I put it down because it's dangerous as 

1638
01:16:59,310 --> 01:16:59,680
shit.
It's just dangerous and it's addictive.

1639
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,140
I know phones are addictive,
so I see people texting.

1640
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:04,270
I think we should all just make an 
agreement.

1641
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:06,790
All of us just leave your fucking phone 
alone.

1642
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,130
When you're in your car.
Don't kill anybody because if you do,

1643
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,060
you'll never forgive yourself.
If you wind up texting and you plow into

1644
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:16,790
someone and someone dies,
some fucking kid dies,

1645
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:20,090
some old lady dies or something.
You'll never forgive yourself.

1646
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,060
Just stop fucking with your phone.
Stop looking down at it.

1647
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:28,180
Put it down and just drive like the one 
time where you can just chill and just 

1648
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:30,680
be involved in what you're doing.
Be Present.

1649
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,730
Be Mindful what you're doing.
I take this fucking thing and I throw it

1650
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:35,600
in the passenger seat.

1651
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,680
I don't even,
I don't want to.

1652
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,190
I don't want it in my lap.
I don't want it in the center console.

1653
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:41,570
I don't want it.
I don't want to look at it.

1654
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,720
Let's put it over there.
I just think we should all do that.

1655
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,070
It's fucking scary,
man.

1656
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:51,071
Watching that dummy yesterday.
Drive in with sunglasses on the right 

1657
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:52,010
handed.
Lean.

1658
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,650
Scrolling through her instagram and like
looking down,

1659
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:55,670
looking down,
looking up,

1660
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,720
looking down,
looking down,

1661
01:17:56,721 --> 01:17:59,780
looking up the amount of distance that 
you travel.

1662
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,560
When you're looking at your phone,
you're going 60 miles an hour and you're

1663
01:18:02,561 --> 01:18:04,640
looking at your phone for like two 
seconds.

1664
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,120
How many fucking feet of you going?
Think about that.

1665
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,870
If you're going 60 miles an hour,
think about that one too.

1666
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,960
That's a lot of fucking space you're 
covering and you're not even looking at 

1667
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:16,960
the road.

1668
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:19,730
Yeah,
I mostly bought to.

1669
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:22,860
So for health fitness,
the sensors on it.

1670
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,810
Eat vegetables,
fit the fitbit.

1671
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:29,830
I had the fitbit for a while but started
fucking up all the time so I heard this 

1672
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,070
is a lot better.
So I thought those fit bits or the shit.

1673
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,380
That's what I hear.
Well they're not waterproof,

1674
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,450
but they're water resistant and I we'd 
win.

1675
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,210
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1676
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,420
Really?
Yeah.

1677
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,450
So how could you have something to 
exercises?

1678
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:46,480
I got some of those beats headphones 
that are supposedly really good that 

1679
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,610
you're supposed to be able to sweat in 
these big,

1680
01:18:47,611 --> 01:18:48,680
just like those,
but yeah,

1681
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:51,350
just like those exact ones,
wireless ones,

1682
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:53,580
they break after you sweat it.
I'm too much shadow.

1683
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:58,580
Fitbit did awesome on that little button
thing that came apart,

1684
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:03,581
so I have a super glue it back together 
and the button stopped working after 

1685
01:19:03,581 --> 01:19:04,490
awhile and then they started working 
again a couple months later I had to buy

1686
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:06,620
another pair just because I needed some.

1687
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,630
Yeah,
I just give these a try.

1688
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:11,880
I've been going wired.
I really liked them except they just.

1689
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,420
You can't sweat too much in them.
That's ridiculous.

1690
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,900
I liked the wired ones,
but when you lift weights and stuff like

1691
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:20,180
specially kettlebell movements and 
things along those lines,

1692
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:25,450
you run the possibility of them getting 
tangled up or they get bunched up 

1693
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:26,870
because that have a microphone on it so 
you can use it for fun.

1694
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,570
It's great for the fall and I love it.
I love it for everything,

1695
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,250
man.
It's great.

1696
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,320
It's really easy.
I like it.

1697
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:34,610
I'm a.
I'm a fan.

1698
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,290
People told me that it's not loud 
enough,

1699
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,800
but you know it's,
I don't want to blow my fucking ears.

1700
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:41,870
I listen to music in the gym the other 
day and it was fine.

1701
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,230
It was good.
Pretty decent headphones,

1702
01:19:45,231 --> 01:19:47,590
but this from what they cost,
they shouldn't be.

1703
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:50,430
They should last five to 10 year 
standard Rs.

1704
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:51,290
200 bucks.
I think.

1705
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,580
Electronics,
man.

1706
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:56,360
I mean you can't get them wet.
It's just they can only protect so much,

1707
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:59,960
which apparently they've done an insane 
job with these iphones.

1708
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,030
You can dump these in a toilet for half 
an hour.

1709
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,430
How do I know this?

1710
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,980
Someone else did it,
but you can dunk it in the

1711
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,430
phone because in the reason why this 
should piss everybody off a little bit.

1712
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:16,790
They made these waterproof because now 
you can turn them in and you can 

1713
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:17,730
exchange them when you want to get a new
one.

1714
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:20,310
So they wanted to make it so they didn't
break.

1715
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:23,370
So why don't you do that already?
You assholes.

1716
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,200
Like why didn't you do that a long time 
ago?

1717
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:28,590
Because samsungs had waterproof phones 
for the new Samsung.

1718
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,680
S seven is waterproof.
Yeah.

1719
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:32,710
What do you got there?
You got the note?

1720
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,700
Five.
No filter.

1721
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:38,720
Dope man.
They're the difference between an 

1722
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,540
android phone and an apple phone is 
almost indistinguishable now.

1723
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,840
As far as like the ability,
the phones ability.

1724
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:48,830
Yeah.
If they could just work on the third 

1725
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:48,870
party apps,
like scopes on it.

1726
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,540
Well instagram was real bad on the old 
version of it.

1727
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:55,230
I only use instagram on a iphone now,
but uh,

1728
01:20:55,290 --> 01:21:00,290
on the old version of it,
but I still use a galaxy phone for the 

1729
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:00,290
studio.
Alon,

1730
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,770
the studio phone for,
for guests and stuff.

1731
01:21:01,771 --> 01:21:03,960
That's a,
that's a ting phone and that's a,

1732
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:05,340
that's an android phone.
I like it,

1733
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:06,780
man.
It works great.

1734
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:09,060
It's smooth.
It's easy to use,

1735
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:09,840
you know,
it doesn't,

1736
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:15,090
that doesn't piss me off when I go 
online with it or anything when I look 

1737
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:18,081
at youtube videos or anything,
but there's some stuff it just doesn't 

1738
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:18,081
have.
It's not as.

1739
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:23,240
Which doesn't make any sense because 
aren't there as many android phones now 

1740
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:23,240
as there are apple phones?

1741
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,680
I think there's more apple.
It should be pretty.

1742
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:29,000
Even if it's not one to just slightly 
over the other.

1743
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:34,130
Yeah,
I would think by now they would've 

1744
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:35,550
caught up like everything would be 
caught up still as far as the android 

1745
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:35,800
goes,
it's still like as a company will make a

1746
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:40,801
phone for like Samsung or Sony or 10 
different companies that can make an 

1747
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:44,611
android phone,
then they have to have the most updated 

1748
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:47,611
version of the operating system and that
any update that has to go through the 

1749
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:49,210
carrier to get through each of those.
So you could have four point one.

1750
01:21:49,211 --> 01:21:54,211
Brian could have four point three.
I could have the new four point five or 

1751
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:54,211
something.
I don't even know if that's real.

1752
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:55,300
Yeah.
And then there's another problem.

1753
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:59,010
The other problem is a lot of companies 
like t mobile or anyone,

1754
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,990
they'll add their own bullshit and then 
um,

1755
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:07,140
Samsung will add their own bullshit on 
top of the original android.

1756
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:11,680
So if you want to buy just android,
like straight android,

1757
01:22:11,681 --> 01:22:14,380
you do it through Google and you get 
that nexus foam.

1758
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:18,040
The nexus phone is really interesting 
because the nexus phone,

1759
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:20,140
you pay google,
you don't pay a carrier,

1760
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:24,670
like you don't pay verizon or t mobile,
you just pay google.

1761
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:29,820
And so your phone works on everything,
it moves around and they just rent time 

1762
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,440
on everybody's network.
I find that to be fascinating.

1763
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:34,300
So it uses both.
Networks,

1764
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:36,430
uses everything.
He says everything.

1765
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,240
So wherever you are apparently make sure
that's true.

1766
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,450
Apparently that's how it works though.
Like you,

1767
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:48,460
you just pay google instead of paying 
verizon or instead of paying t mobile 

1768
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:52,810
and theoretically it uses the best 
signal around all the time.

1769
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:54,700
It seems like somebody like t mobile 
like,

1770
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:56,470
Nah,
we don't want you to do that.

1771
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,200
Why would they do that?
We make more money.

1772
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,570
Maybe they wouldn't.
I mean,

1773
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:03,130
I don't think they even.
I mean,

1774
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,930
people even think Google themselves as 
being a cell phone provider.

1775
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,960
Most people don't think of it.
You think of Android,

1776
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:14,710
but most people don't think about buying
their phone from google and using Google

1777
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:17,530
as their service provider.
Do they?

1778
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:19,040
I mean,
I've never heard that.

1779
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:24,210
Chris Ryan told me about it.
Dr Chris Ryan from sex at dawn and 

1780
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:25,570
tangentially speaking,
he uh,

1781
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:27,310
that's what he's got.
He got it that way.

1782
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,830
And he got it because he wants it to 
work everywhere.

1783
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,000
And He,
when he's Roman,

1784
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:33,820
there's no roaming.
His phone works in Indonesia,

1785
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,020
works everywhere.
It's just,

1786
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,140
it just works.
It's how the team mobile is pretty much.

1787
01:23:38,141 --> 01:23:39,840
You can go pretty much anywhere and it 
just works.

1788
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:42,130
It's like Canada.
There's no extra cost.

1789
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:44,320
It's just crossing Mexico or nothing.
Now.

1790
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:50,130
That's how it should be.
But didn't they get in trouble for 

1791
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:50,130
streaming,
for throttling?

1792
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:52,550
There's nothing.
So they have this plan that's a,

1793
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,600
they don't charge you for Netflix for 
videos or any music's things like 

1794
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,950
spotify.
So all that bandwidth is free.

1795
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:02,730
It's all you can eat.
So now it's been exposed or whatever.

1796
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:07,760
They didn't really hide it,
but they said that the videos are down 

1797
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,150
graded to for ADP,
which is like for your phone 100 percent

1798
01:24:11,371 --> 01:24:16,371
fine.
Like you're in the difference between 

1799
01:24:16,371 --> 01:24:16,371
seven,
20:00

1800
01:24:16,371 --> 01:24:18,300
PM for ADP on a whatever,
a four inch screen or five inch screen.

1801
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:19,590
You're not going to notice the 
difference.

1802
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:24,800
So.
But Verizon and att and t made a huge 

1803
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:24,800
deal about it.
Blah,

1804
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,981
blah blah.
What's funny though is yesterday on the 

1805
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:29,730
owner's periscope,
the CEO of t a t mobile,

1806
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:35,180
it was shown that this whole time 
verizon and att and t had been 

1807
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:35,180
downgrading.
There's two,

1808
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:39,741
three,
20 p said they just got caught for like 

1809
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,600
even having worse signal then a team.
Everybody does it.

1810
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,060
Everybody eyes and then the beams 
acceptable.

1811
01:24:45,061 --> 01:24:50,061
It seems like an intelligent move.
Make sure that your stream doesn't get 

1812
01:24:50,061 --> 01:24:50,061
interrupted because it's not too much 
download.

1813
01:24:50,061 --> 01:24:52,500
And netflix is actually the ones behind 
it.

1814
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,560
Uh,
who was downgrading it from mobile 

1815
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,920
because if everyone in the road had 10 
80 p for no reason,

1816
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,050
there's no reason for it.
Well,

1817
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:03,960
it seems like a massive waste of phone.
It is.

1818
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,960
I mean,
if you can't meet,

1819
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:09,970
you're looking at a phone,
but I have to tell you one thing I 

1820
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:12,871
fucking love about apple is apple tv 
because I have apple tv at home and a 

1821
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:14,500
buddy of mine.
Yeah,

1822
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:16,090
I got the new one,
but even the album was great.

1823
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:19,960
But a buddy of mine texted me a youtube 
video of his show,

1824
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:23,050
so he texted me.
So I click on the link.

1825
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,210
It starts playing,
I press down on the button,

1826
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,570
it starts showing on my tv I'm talking 
about in seconds,

1827
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,760
so I got this text,
Bang.

1828
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:35,590
He shows me an episode of his TV show.
I put it on the TV and I sit back on the

1829
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:39,280
couch and I'm watching it in real time 
stream on television.

1830
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:41,080
I'm like,
this is fucking crazy.

1831
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:46,320
Like this guy just sent me a show and 
it's playing right now from my phone to 

1832
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:51,631
the TV and it's perfect.
It's in hd and I'm watching it and my 

1833
01:25:51,631 --> 01:25:52,870
mouth was why?
I was like I was.

1834
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,490
My jaw was open.
I was like,

1835
01:25:54,491 --> 01:25:55,420
I couldn't.
I can't believe.

1836
01:25:55,540 --> 01:26:00,540
Do you have the new one yet?
But I love it because you're just using 

1837
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:01,840
the microphone and being like a broad 
city and it shows you where it's on Hulu

1838
01:26:01,841 --> 01:26:04,870
or Netflix and you just click on it will
scroll,

1839
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:08,030
Scroll thing to scroll with that top 
thing.

1840
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:13,031
It's like a touch pad.
Do except by always having an upside 

1841
01:26:13,031 --> 01:26:14,390
down or it's embedded and I'd sit on it 
and it turns it off.

1842
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,840
If there's a lot of problems with that 
remote cat paused the walking dead.

1843
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:20,150
They're all over it.
He's,

1844
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:22,520
my cat is such a whore.
Like when,

1845
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:24,170
uh,
when you sit on the couch,

1846
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,250
like,
it's like,

1847
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,600
oh yeah,
that's right.

1848
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:31,750
It's like if you were a sleazy guy and a
girl said you can stay over at my house 

1849
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,880
but don't try anything.
And you're like,

1850
01:26:34,881 --> 01:26:36,200
yeah,
and we'll try nothing.

1851
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,040
Don't worry about it.

1852
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,280
And he climbed in bed with her and he 
took your pants off and you started like

1853
01:26:40,281 --> 01:26:43,100
rubbing your at Dick up against her ass.
That's all my cats like.

1854
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:43,940
You're like,
look dude,

1855
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:46,340
I'm going to sit down here and I'm gonna
just watch TV.

1856
01:26:46,341 --> 01:26:46,940
Okay.
And he's like,

1857
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:47,570
yeah,
yeah,

1858
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,530
cool,
cool.

1859
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:52,440
And He plops down next to you and he 
forces his head into your armpits and he

1860
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:56,150
walks all over you and climbs on top of 
you.

1861
01:26:56,151 --> 01:26:57,980
And he's like constantly what?
Jim?

1862
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:58,340
Oh,
sorry.

1863
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:04,420
What is this?
This is that Google a network cellular 

1864
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,710
network that you're talking about?
Oh,

1865
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,050
this is a google fi.
Okay.

1866
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,400
And so this is what works with the nexus
phone.

1867
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:17,670
Their phone.
And then you pay them for one plan and 

1868
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:19,730
you paid for their data and their $10 
per gig for data.

1869
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:22,130
Five basics,
$20 per month.

1870
01:27:22,131 --> 01:27:23,210
Fuck off.

1871
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:28,160
See how many gigs I used at month seven 
or eight?

1872
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,140
Hold on.
It's always $10 per gigabyte.

1873
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:34,730
$10.
$10 per gig per month.

1874
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:38,890
$20 for two gigs.
So if you're only using $30,

1875
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:43,230
it's ridiculous.
How much does a lot though?

1876
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:47,030
How many gigs do you use a month?
I think I used about seven or eight gigs

1877
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:48,680
a month.
I'm around three,

1878
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:49,960
three and a half.
Maybe three now.

1879
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,130
I did a lot of periscope and video 
stuff.

1880
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,490
Oh.
So that counts all of that streaming you

1881
01:27:55,491 --> 01:28:00,491
do listening to music unless you're 
downloading it from the servers and 

1882
01:28:00,491 --> 01:28:00,491
whatnot.
That's interesting.

1883
01:28:00,491 --> 01:28:02,420
So do you have unlimited downloads,
Brian?

1884
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:05,120
Like how does men live?
I have a family plan,

1885
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:07,910
which is unlimited data unlimited.
Yeah.

1886
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:12,620
That's my t mobile limited.
Unlimited for unused data though.

1887
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:13,710
Huh?
Cool.

1888
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,230
Yeah.
You don't pay for unused data.

1889
01:28:15,231 --> 01:28:17,270
Everybody's doing that.
That's what tim does.

1890
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:18,180
Everybody does that.
Yeah.

1891
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,540
That's so smart.
It's pretty expensive though.

1892
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,530
Does it?
Yeah,

1893
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,270
it says 32 bucks a month for two gigs 
and Jamie just says he only uses three,

1894
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:31,390
so let's make it 42 bucks off without 
the $20 you can change your life without

1895
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,220
that.
Plus the cost of data.

1896
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:35,300
Yeah.
Okay.

1897
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:39,140
So that would be $20 plus 30.
Well he's come,

1898
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:41,360
he's got three.
That doesn't make any sense because he's

1899
01:28:41,361 --> 01:28:44,240
got 20 bucks plus two gigs.
So he's got two gigs.

1900
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:48,230
That's $20 and then it's only 10,
$12.

1901
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:53,231
More than that.
You got eight bucks back because he 

1902
01:28:53,231 --> 01:28:55,991
didn't use all this data.
See if I used three point five,

1903
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,410
you will go to Brian.
What's Brian uses?

1904
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:02,550
Seven cranking up to eight.
Let's go to for fun.

1905
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:07,640
Let's go to eight.
Just to be honest with your Cam girling 

1906
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:07,640
100 bucks a month,
which is fine.

1907
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:08,880
It's fine.
That's normal.

1908
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:09,880
What do you pay a month,
Brian?

1909
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,170
How about 100 bucks to fuck?
Are you talking about bones?

1910
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:18,171
And I can use an iphone,
but this puts you on technically the 

1911
01:29:18,171 --> 01:29:20,400
best network possible at any given 
moment.

1912
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,410
And I'll tell you what though,
do that nexus phone is fucking so wheat.

1913
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,410
That is a sweet phone.
Have you seen those?

1914
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:29,040
No.
Iphone.

1915
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,470
It's not.
I don't know dude.

1916
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:33,660
They're top of the line.
Can't beat this iphone man.

1917
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:35,670
Really?
This the new camera.

1918
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:38,940
The camera on these phones is just as 
good.

1919
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:40,920
See,
receive it.

1920
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:44,490
What is the comparison like nexus 
comparisons to sign?

1921
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:49,510
It's hard to argue it.
I'm pretty sure the people like a unbox 

1922
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:53,850
therapy or what does that dude's name?
Marcus Mkbhd.

1923
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,550
He's really good at that.
Mark has.

1924
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:01,800
He's really good at his breakdown so he 
really knows his shit when it comes to a

1925
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:06,030
cellular technology and all the 
different components of cell phones.

1926
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:10,080
See what he thinks about them.
I'm interested to try it though.

1927
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,800
I mean just to see if it really is 
because that's one thing that I just 

1928
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,790
drove to San Jose and you know when 
you're going through the grapevine,

1929
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,940
I had zero service for like a good hour 
or so.

1930
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,770
And everybody though.
No,

1931
01:30:22,771 --> 01:30:27,771
well I was in a phone with somebody from
verizon when somebody from 18 and t 

1932
01:30:27,771 --> 01:30:29,730
verizon was dead and he though it was 
okay,

1933
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:34,470
so it would be cool to see if I went 
through that with that service.

1934
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:39,471
If it just automatically went to a t and
t or or if it really just chooses like 

1935
01:30:39,471 --> 01:30:43,791
sprint smartphone cameras shoot out.
Galaxy s seven edge takes on the iphone 

1936
01:30:45,931 --> 01:30:48,840
six plus.
This is a comparison there.

1937
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:51,180
Just do some side by side photos,
just photos.

1938
01:30:51,181 --> 01:30:51,960
Okay,
look at that.

1939
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:57,490
Let's see which one is.
I think the Samsung is the one on the 

1940
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:57,490
left.

1941
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:57,490
On the one on.
On top I guess,

1942
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,760
and when I scroll over here it shows you
the iphone version.

1943
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:00,750
Okay.
Iphone is better.

1944
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:04,150
Way better away.
It's over conversations.

1945
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:06,030
Dead Front.
Facing camera.

1946
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:11,060
Let's see.
The difference in the front facing 

1947
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:11,060
camera.
Which one is which?

1948
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:11,060
Again?
I think it's the samsungs on the left.

1949
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:11,610
Okay.
That's over.

1950
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:15,210
Iphone is better.
Conversations over.

1951
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:20,370
I use both everyday.
They both have low light into this.

1952
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,870
We're doing these kinds of comparisons 
though.

1953
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:23,430
It's really hard to make these.
Wait a minute.

1954
01:31:23,431 --> 01:31:25,030
Who's that?
Who's that low light?

1955
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:27,540
This one should be iphone.
This should be Samsung.

1956
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:30,680
Samsung is way better,
but you know the uh,

1957
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,700
the photographer,
how well they do.

1958
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:37,900
But that's the same.
That's the same photo we're supposed to 

1959
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:37,900
assume.
Yeah,

1960
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:37,900
I were supposed to,
but wait a minute.

1961
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:42,500
Samsung's bigger aperture really comes 
into play when you're taking photos in 

1962
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:42,500
low light.

1963
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,190
These images were shot in the dark back 
corner of a coffee shop and both phones 

1964
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:49,500
struggled,
but the iphone fared worse.

1965
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:54,560
That's a big difference man.
And Scroll back again so you can see 

1966
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:54,560
the,
that is way better.

1967
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:59,450
Samsung is fucking way better.
Like that is such a vast contrast.

1968
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:06,210
Yeah.
I don't buy this one though because I 

1969
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:08,371
use.
I mean the note five is one of the best 

1970
01:32:08,371 --> 01:32:10,760
cameras.
The no five is one of the best cameras 

1971
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:14,520
on a Samsung.
And I use both of these every night and 

1972
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,640
while the,
this one does have good low light,

1973
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:20,730
it also,
it's very blurry when you move it 

1974
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:20,730
around,
it's hard to get a really good shot.

1975
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:25,020
Right?
But that doesn't have as good of 

1976
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:25,020
cameras.
Yes.

1977
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,791
Seven edge,
seven edges of the newer camera and 

1978
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,720
newer by four months or so,
but it's newer,

1979
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:32,050
but is it better be get better mom,
man,

1980
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:35,960
you're doing your new iphone cameras.

1981
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:40,970
He's doing chem trails a little bit,
but I'm just trying to add like there's 

1982
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:43,870
certain things you can do when you're 
taking a phone in a dark situation and 

1983
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:46,651
make it look a little bit better and we 
don't know if they're doing all that 

1984
01:32:46,651 --> 01:32:47,920
they can to make the picture.
Look at this.

1985
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:49,860
Let's see.
Um,

1986
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:52,120
this one here.
Speed.

1987
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,490
Which is what's the difference?
Shutter speed?

1988
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:55,850
Will they both look good?
Yeah,

1989
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:56,820
it's,
it's very.

1990
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,270
Which one's that?
Is that Samsung?

1991
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,770
Samsung on top?
That looks better.

1992
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:03,850
I fumble a Samsung one looks better,
but here's the problem.

1993
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:05,830
The angle slightly different.
Do it again.

1994
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:11,040
See that one?
You're going down more than when you're 

1995
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,040
up more.
So that's what I mean.

1996
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,790
The light changes everyone.
We do it more time.

1997
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:17,820
Scroll back pretty fucking close and 
it's really such a where they should go 

1998
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:24,151
way out of their way to make sure you 
have the exact same angle because when 

1999
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:25,600
you don't have the same angle,
it's hard to tell like one of them,

2000
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:27,460
like this one is way closer.

2001
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,380
Yeah.
Like why would they do that?

2002
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:35,710
It's really one is that this is the 
Samsung top was pretty God damn good,

2003
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:37,750
but that looks better.
Boy Genius report,

2004
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:40,220
which is a pretty legit website.
Uh,

2005
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,420
they did a whole thing with the 
[inaudible] versus the iphone six plus a

2006
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:50,050
and they found that the iphone is still 
the best.

2007
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:55,110
It's a says the SR two six plus camera 
outperformed the s seven more often than

2008
01:33:57,281 --> 01:33:59,450
not.
Yeah,

2009
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:02,320
it seems like it,
it seems like only low light is where it

2010
01:34:02,321 --> 01:34:05,530
really has it nailed.
But God damn the differences like here,

2011
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:11,310
these are the differences that the 
iphone seems to get things a little 

2012
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:12,850
lighter and clear.
It's like,

2013
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:17,851
here's another low light.
This is an s seven and this is the 

2014
01:34:17,851 --> 01:34:19,780
iphone and this is way better than this 
and this is a little light picture.

2015
01:34:19,781 --> 01:34:21,940
So again,
it's just the photographer,

2016
01:34:21,941 --> 01:34:23,260
you can't really do this shit.

2017
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:24,910
You could just have to have the camera 
and go.

2018
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:26,950
Yeah.
Most of the time that this way works.

2019
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:32,370
They should do,
they should have like a double selfie 

2020
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:34,561
stick that faces forward and they press 
Baltimore the exact same time in the 

2021
01:34:34,561 --> 01:34:36,160
exact same level.
You would do that?

2022
01:34:36,161 --> 01:34:37,250
Yeah,
they usually do that.

2023
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:38,890
Yeah.
That's how they should do it.

2024
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:44,190
They should have everything on a mounted
platform that takes a photo of the exact

2025
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:48,520
same time so that you know.
But even then one of them would be a few

2026
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:51,670
inches over to the side.
So you'd get a little slightly different

2027
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:52,190
angle.
Yeah.

2028
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:56,920
Yeah.
But either way they're both really good.

2029
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:57,710
Fourth,
it just,

2030
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:02,750
it,
it's just what kind of environment you 

2031
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:04,361
have.
I use all apple shit so it's easier for 

2032
01:35:04,361 --> 01:35:04,490
me.
But if I didn't have apolis it,

2033
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:07,750
I probably would use just a Samsung 
five.

2034
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:13,060
Well that's like I said,
my friends sending me that video and I 

2035
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:13,400
watched it on my TV and seconds.
There's nothing like that that exists in

2036
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:14,330
android yet.
Is there?

2037
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,850
Yeah.
You could have a google chromecast.

2038
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,450
Oh yeah.
That setup or Amazon fire stick.

2039
01:35:20,451 --> 01:35:21,680
I have that too.
Oh,

2040
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:26,800
okay.
So what that means is that like a stick 

2041
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:26,870
it into the USB?
Is that how it works?

2042
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:31,400
Or The htmi actual TV.
You download the chrome cast app to your

2043
01:35:31,401 --> 01:35:34,370
phone so that anytime you have a video 
playing it because it just as good.

2044
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:35,570
No,
no,

2045
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,920
I don't have an apple tv so I can't,
I've never used it.

2046
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,660
I have chromecast.
Uh,

2047
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:46,680
it works not as good for me.
Like I really stutters a lot when you're

2048
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:50,300
playing stuff back in,
you have to play it through chrome only.

2049
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,260
So it's like,
oh,

2050
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:52,180
you have to go through the browser.

2051
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:57,440
And a lot of times like apple is just 
way better when it comes to that in my 

2052
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,570
opinion.
The thing about the apple setup was that

2053
01:35:59,571 --> 01:36:01,210
it was instantaneous.
Yeah.

2054
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:03,110
That was what blew me away.
My friend was like,

2055
01:36:03,111 --> 01:36:04,610
Hey,
check this episode out.

2056
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,730
I click it and then it's plan.
I'm like,

2057
01:36:07,731 --> 01:36:09,020
Whoa,
this is nuts.

2058
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:14,050
I mean,
I'm telling you from the moment I 

2059
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:14,780
received the text to the moment I was 
kicked back on the couch watching it was

2060
01:36:14,781 --> 01:36:16,250
more than.
No more than 10 seconds.

2061
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:18,050
Yeah.
This is insane.

2062
01:36:18,051 --> 01:36:19,640
And you can stream your,
your,

2063
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:24,650
your,
your whole entire phone to your tv so 

2064
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:24,650
you can sit there and just text while 
looking at the TV.

2065
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:28,430
One clicking is so big like Amazon one 
click.

2066
01:36:28,431 --> 01:36:29,300
If you need something.
Oh,

2067
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:31,010
I'm out of printer ink.
Let me just go here.

2068
01:36:31,011 --> 01:36:31,970
One Click,
Bam.

2069
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:34,160
And then one clicking on apple store.

2070
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,310
That's so big.
Like to be able to just click it and get

2071
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:38,090
it.
Do you want this?

2072
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:39,800
Yeah.
Send me a battery bitch.

2073
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:41,000
Boom.
Yeah.

2074
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:42,800
I get mad now that it's not.
Same Day.

2075
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:43,370
I'm like,
what is it?

2076
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:45,360
That same day,
set a fucking.

2077
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,680
Send the Goddamn drone.
Get over here.

2078
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:52,850
Do you have anything that you like?
I have the subscription on certain items

2079
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:55,070
that I know I need every month.
I don't do that.

2080
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,520
I do,
but wipes a gummy bear vitamins used to 

2081
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,150
flush your butt wipes.
Do you flush it line?

2082
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:03,170
It's not my house.
Those things don't work.

2083
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:03,920
Yeah,
I know.

2084
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:08,990
Can't flush them.
They showed a special on it on some 

2085
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:12,060
shows are stupid.
They make them so they call them 

2086
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,070
flushable.
Those fucking people should all go to 

2087
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:15,070
jail.
That shit is not flushable.

2088
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:18,780
You are clogging pipes all over the 
world that causing millions of dollars 

2089
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:18,890
for the plumbing problems all over the 
world.

2090
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:22,270
This clogging shit up.
Paint that stuff.

2091
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:25,700
So that's like a thin synthetic paper.
You can't just.

2092
01:37:25,701 --> 01:37:30,701
It's not gonna.
It's not gonna dissolve like toilet 

2093
01:37:30,701 --> 01:37:30,701
paper.
Either way,

2094
01:37:30,701 --> 01:37:33,260
all those things are gross.
Those toilets that we had in Japan,

2095
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,120
remember,
that's what I have now.

2096
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,100
You're so lucky.
Oh,

2097
01:37:36,101 --> 01:37:37,820
I'm addicted.
You can get one of those.

2098
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,230
You.
You're always there.

2099
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:42,770
They have the shitty ones at Amazon.
Just attached the topic.

2100
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,720
Is that kind of you have give given the 
Amazon.

2101
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:48,280
You can get it online.
I'll tell you the company that I see own

2102
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:53,320
my place,
so I'm not going to put a nice toilet 

2103
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:53,320
removed.
When you leave,

2104
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:53,320
you hire someone to do it.
They come over,

2105
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,650
they install it,
and then you hire someone to take it out

2106
01:37:55,651 --> 01:37:56,160
when you're gone.

2107
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,750
It seems like you just don't want to do 
that.

2108
01:37:57,751 --> 01:38:01,980
Right.
You get a nice warm jet of water up your

2109
01:38:01,981 --> 01:38:05,040
asshole anytime you want.
I have a bit about it now.

2110
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:06,150
Let him do it.
Because it's true.

2111
01:38:06,151 --> 01:38:08,670
Like if you read some wacky tweets by 
me,

2112
01:38:08,671 --> 01:38:12,270
most likely I've got a jet of hot water 
shooting up my ass when I'm writing.

2113
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:19,110
I do some ferocious tweeting on the 
toilet when the UFC going back to Japan.

2114
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,610
Um,
we don't have any plans.

2115
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:23,410
New York coming up first,
right?

2116
01:38:23,411 --> 01:38:25,690
Yes.
We got approved in New York.

2117
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,960
That was part of Rosie O'Donnell's 
brother's gay fantasy.

2118
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:31,630
They don't think they have a car setup 
yet.

2119
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:34,360
The next big one is the John Jones 
fight,

2120
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,600
which is in,
um,

2121
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,230
that's in Vegas.
That's a huge card.

2122
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:40,110
Jon Jones.
Daniel cormier.

2123
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:40,950
Rematch.
Dump,

2124
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,070
dump,
dump.

2125
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,900
That's a big deal.
That's going to be insane.

2126
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:50,470
There's a really cool documentary I 
recommend called spy in the pod.

2127
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:54,580
It's a,
I think it's a three part BBC series.

2128
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:59,730
What they did is they made these robot 
fish and turtles and dolphins and they 

2129
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:02,290
had cameras all over them,
like in their eyes and stuff like that,

2130
01:39:02,291 --> 01:39:07,291
and they swam with the dolphins.
So the dolphins thought these fake 

2131
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:07,720
robots.
We're like apart,

2132
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:10,150
like,
like friends or like another dolphin.

2133
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:15,450
And it's really cool how they got to go,
like really into like things that no 

2134
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,420
one's ever seen before because you know,
they,

2135
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:18,070
you know,
it's just a robot.

2136
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:19,860
Uh,
and uh,

2137
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:25,080
it's also really cool to see how other 
fish attacked like the turtle and stuff 

2138
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,010
like that.
And that seemed like that's a camera.

2139
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:32,040
That's a,
this is a fake turtle that's going 

2140
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,140
around and that's a fake fish.
It's really silly also,

2141
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:35,490
but it got really cool.
Uh,

2142
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:38,730
it was dolphins catching flying fish in 
the air and their mouth.

2143
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:41,070
Yeah.
Dolphin life is a ball.

2144
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,770
They're just having a great old time out
there in the ocean.

2145
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:49,650
Is He?
Seaworld is say they're not going to 

2146
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:49,650
breed orcas anymore.
Yeah.

2147
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:49,920
But that's still,
that's like,

2148
01:39:49,921 --> 01:39:54,921
we're not going to breed our slaves 
slaves and no longer going to make any 

2149
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:56,640
space another way to buy them.
Don't worry,

2150
01:39:56,641 --> 01:39:57,870
I'll.
Well,

2151
01:39:58,230 --> 01:40:03,230
that's what got exposed by Phil.
Phil Demaris when he was on the podcast 

2152
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:05,310
exposed that he's like sea world.
They're liars.

2153
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,520
They're getting there.
They're dolphins in their orchestra from

2154
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:11,280
another company which gets them from the
wild.

2155
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,650
Like that's how they got them and for 
them to say,

2156
01:40:13,651 --> 01:40:15,260
we haven't gotten a captive.
See,

2157
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:17,910
I'm an Orca from the wild in 30 years.
He's like,

2158
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,950
that's a lie.
That's just not true.

2159
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:22,740
Yeah.
They haven't gotten them from the wild.

2160
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,030
You're right,
they haven't done it.

2161
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,700
They got somebody else to do it.
Somebody else did it.

2162
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:31,701
They sold it to one organization.
Then they got their dolphins from that 

2163
01:40:31,701 --> 01:40:31,701
organization.
It's all fucked up,

2164
01:40:31,701 --> 01:40:31,720
man.
Those are.

2165
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:33,630
Those are like people.
They're like,

2166
01:40:33,631 --> 01:40:34,710
oh,
a water person.

2167
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:40,310
And they're just.
They have a different way of existing 

2168
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,210
than we do,
but there are smart as shit,

2169
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:46,380
like in some crazy way that we don't 
understand the noises they make.

2170
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:48,960
We still can't decipher them.
We don't even know what the hell they're

2171
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:51,240
saying.
We have no idea what they're saying,

2172
01:40:51,241 --> 01:40:53,620
but they know what they're saying and 
crazy.

2173
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:57,580
That is that like they have a language 
that we have been studying.

2174
01:40:57,581 --> 01:41:00,640
Uh,
John Lilly was studying that shit in the

2175
01:41:00,641 --> 01:41:04,510
19 sixties and when lily was done 
studying it,

2176
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:09,690
what they were trying to do is they were
trying to talk dolphins into making 

2177
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:09,970
people noises.

2178
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:14,410
There's a radiolab podcast about it,
I think it's called hello.

2179
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:20,310
And they were trying to figure out a way
to get dolphins to make human language 

2180
01:41:20,681 --> 01:41:24,250
noises so that we could understand them.
They even have the voice box to do that.

2181
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:25,320
No,
no,

2182
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:27,520
that was part of the problem.
But they wanted to imitate it.

2183
01:41:27,521 --> 01:41:30,490
But also part of the problem was they 
had this lady,

2184
01:41:30,491 --> 01:41:34,420
researcher Lilly who was crazy for 
people that don't know.

2185
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:35,230
I mean,
brilliant,

2186
01:41:35,231 --> 01:41:38,380
crazy but crazy.
Lily invented the semi,

2187
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:40,870
the sensory deprivation tank.
Lily.

2188
01:41:40,871 --> 01:41:44,920
I'm also was this pioneer of 
interspecies communication.

2189
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:50,340
I mean,
he was really like working on this 

2190
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,700
dolphin thing long before anybody 
thought it was viable.

2191
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:54,610
He was trying to figure out how to 
communicate with dolphins and the one of

2192
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:58,210
the methods that he came up with,
he was set up a sensory deprivation tank

2193
01:41:58,211 --> 01:42:03,211
next to a dolphin tank and he would take
acid and climbing the sensory 

2194
01:42:03,211 --> 01:42:07,771
deprivation tank,
jacked up on acid and try to like sense 

2195
01:42:07,771 --> 01:42:11,581
thoughts through the water and listened 
to them talking and see if he could 

2196
01:42:11,581 --> 01:42:11,581
decipher them.

2197
01:42:11,581 --> 01:42:15,960
And apparently he had some anecdotal 
success or he kind of understood what 

2198
01:42:16,991 --> 01:42:17,650
they were,
but who,

2199
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:20,200
I mean it's fucked up on acid.
Who knows what he's actually seeing.

2200
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:22,860
But the woman that he was with,
um,

2201
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,090
this was the interesting part about it.
She,

2202
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,640
the woman that was part of this 
experiment,

2203
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:32,850
she lived in this place that they 
created for dolphins and the place that 

2204
01:42:33,101 --> 01:42:36,280
they created for dolphins was.
They had this,

2205
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:41,281
I'm like living room setup and they had 
water in the living room and these 

2206
01:42:41,281 --> 01:42:45,991
dolphins swam around,
or this dolphin swam around in this 

2207
01:42:45,991 --> 01:42:48,670
water with her.
And it lived with her,

2208
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:53,700
like her bed was in the water.
So she would like get out of bed and 

2209
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:57,960
stepped down.
And she'd be in waist high water and 

2210
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:57,960
she'd walk around like that.
Well,

2211
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:00,430
the dolphins in this area that often 
gets horny and it's a big distraction.

2212
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:02,770
So what she decides to do is start 
jerking the dolphin off.

2213
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,870
Just like that guy that got caught last 
week that you hear about this.

2214
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,350
No.
Yeah.

2215
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:13,440
This happened last week.
And of course every time there's any 

2216
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:13,450
kind of news with dolphin sex,
everyone tweets me.

2217
01:43:13,451 --> 01:43:18,451
So dolphin sex abuse whistleblower calls
out aquarium for jerking off sea 

2218
01:43:18,451 --> 01:43:19,450
mammals.
Why is that a bad thing?

2219
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,790
Nothing wrong with that.
So this lady,

2220
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:24,700
what was her description of it was,
it was,

2221
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:28,070
it was a physical need that had to be 
taken care of before they can go back to

2222
01:43:28,071 --> 01:43:31,210
doing the work.
Like this dolphin was so distracted.

2223
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,760
What are you doing over there?
I was looking at that story,

2224
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:36,820
still looking it up after you put it on 
the screen.

2225
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:39,760
He cut,
he just put it up.

2226
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,740
Um,
so she,

2227
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:42,820
you know,
she was like,

2228
01:43:42,821 --> 01:43:46,840
this is just a reality of being a living
thing with a sex drive.

2229
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,060
Like we have to take care of this.
Otherwise it's going to distract them,

2230
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:54,390
but that shut down all the research and 
then they found out about lily doing 

2231
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,550
acid and he's also being in the 
ketamine.

2232
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:58,940
You'd shoot ketamine into Moscow 
intramuscularly and get into the sensory

2233
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:01,520
deprivation tank guy was out of his 
mind.

2234
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:07,180
Just some of those guys,
especially back then when people didn't 

2235
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:10,040
really know what the fuck ketamine was,
you know,

2236
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:13,360
they didn't understand what this guy was
doing and this is the acid days,

2237
01:44:13,361 --> 01:44:18,361
like acid wasn't even illegal back then.
This guy was doing all these wacky 

2238
01:44:18,361 --> 01:44:20,780
experiments and he was so far off the 
deep end,

2239
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:26,050
like so far removed from what most 
people knew about psychedelic drugs that

2240
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:31,841
he was just,
he was just out there on the furthest 

2241
01:44:31,841 --> 01:44:33,410
fringes.
And now just to this day,

2242
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:35,660
people are still trying to figure out 
what the fuck he was doing.

2243
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:38,500
Still trying to figure out how far we 
got and what,

2244
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,550
you know,
he was a,

2245
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,350
he was a real crazy man.
Like Lily.

2246
01:44:43,351 --> 01:44:44,660
Um,
he was the,

2247
01:44:44,661 --> 01:44:47,630
the motivation behind that movie altered
states.

2248
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:51,740
That was all about lily because lily was
a scientist and you know,

2249
01:44:51,741 --> 01:44:53,840
then he was taken all this crazy shit 
and people are like,

2250
01:44:53,841 --> 01:44:54,160
Whoa,
Whoa,

2251
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:55,460
Whoa,
what the fuck are you doing,

2252
01:44:55,461 --> 01:45:00,461
man?
Like you're taking some crazy 

2253
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:00,461
psychedelic drugs and we don't even 
really understand.

2254
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:00,461
He's like,
Eh,

2255
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:01,520
whatever,
dude,

2256
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:04,490
leave me alone.
We'll go hang out with dolphins.

2257
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:07,550
It would just take this stuff.
But the,

2258
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:12,551
uh,
the radio lab podcast is really 

2259
01:45:12,551 --> 01:45:14,291
interesting because it's,
it's weird how hung up people get where 

2260
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:19,330
as soon as it becomes about sex.
Like if the dolphin had any other needs 

2261
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:21,870
that had to be met,
like maybe dolphins have a,

2262
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:25,730
a certain amount of hugging that they 
have to have on a daily basis.

2263
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:30,730
Like maybe their unique requirements are
that they need to be caressed on a daily

2264
01:45:31,041 --> 01:45:32,390
basis.
Otherwise they get sick.

2265
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,790
If people just climbing in the tank with
them and correct them,

2266
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:38,060
no one ever problem,
but it's caressing his dick.

2267
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:40,220
They were like,
no way.

2268
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:45,610
That's where you draw the line.
We draw the line there because we're 

2269
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:48,881
ashamed of sex were shamed or sexuality.
So a scientist who addresses sexuality 

2270
01:45:50,151 --> 01:45:53,570
the same way we would address food,
shelter,

2271
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,760
warmth,
like as a physical need.

2272
01:45:55,761 --> 01:46:00,761
She addressed it as a scientist,
not confined by the constraints of our 

2273
01:46:00,761 --> 01:46:02,840
culture and our ridiculous civilization.
She just thought about,

2274
01:46:02,841 --> 01:46:03,890
okay,
we got a problem here,

2275
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:06,500
let's take care of this problem,
and then we can try to get this thing to

2276
01:46:06,501 --> 01:46:08,480
say hello.
And everybody's like,

2277
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,730
we're shutting it down.
You're jerking off.

2278
01:46:10,731 --> 01:46:15,731
Dolphins is John Lilly.
Assistance that are alive are working 

2279
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:19,250
and that woman's.

2280
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:21,710
A lot of the women in the Radiolab 
podcast.

2281
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:23,030
She's still alive.
Yeah,

2282
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:26,090
there's a few of them that are alive.
I'm todd mccormick,

2283
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:29,150
has John Lilly's sensory deprivation 
tank.

2284
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:34,390
He's got one of his.
He was a part of the early Samati 

2285
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:34,390
company.
My,

2286
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:38,861
uh,
my first sensory deprivation tank was a 

2287
01:46:38,861 --> 01:46:39,320
somebody that's the one I wound up 
giving away online.

2288
01:46:39,321 --> 01:46:44,321
Remember we made that video and we gave 
it away was when I found out about the 

2289
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:45,290
float lab float labs pot there.
Their pods,

2290
01:46:45,291 --> 01:46:48,590
they're a sensory depth.
Tanks are just so much better.

2291
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:51,930
There's two companies that really 
fucking kill it right now.

2292
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:55,800
There's a float lab which just kills it.
They make the best shit.

2293
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:58,560
Everything is state of the art,
state of the art,

2294
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:01,680
a decontamination of the water,
ozone,

2295
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:02,880
all that stuff.
By the way,

2296
01:47:02,881 --> 01:47:07,740
I've zeroed like connection with them or
any other sensory deprivation tank.

2297
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:10,020
I don't have any business.
I'm not,

2298
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,810
I'm not selling them.
Although we have talked to,

2299
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,670
um,
there's another company in,

2300
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:16,980
in Austin.
What does the zero gravity.

2301
01:47:16,981 --> 01:47:21,981
Is that what's called an Austin?
Make sure it's that they have a dope 

2302
01:47:21,981 --> 01:47:22,830
tank as well.
And we've thought about,

2303
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:23,660
um,
we've,

2304
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:28,730
we've talked about it,
the onnit company of releasing an audit 

2305
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:32,300
tank or being involved in some sort of 
high end tank because what this guy's 

2306
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:35,730
doing in Austin is A.
Kevin is his name zero gravity.

2307
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:38,280
Uh,
Kevin is doing it with,

2308
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:43,380
um,
he's using like bolt holes like the,

2309
01:47:44,311 --> 01:47:46,560
uh,
the same companies that make.

2310
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:47,880
There's Kevin right there with the long 
hair.

2311
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:52,950
Look at that fucking God damn hippie.
He's a great guy by the way.

2312
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:54,180
Super Nice Guy.
But his,

2313
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:59,181
his tanks are,
they're right up there with the float 

2314
01:47:59,181 --> 01:47:59,340
lab tanks and what they're doing is 
instead of having a lining,

2315
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:03,540
like the float lab uses this super thick
lining.

2316
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:06,570
That's what it looked like,
similar to what the float labs look like

2317
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:11,571
in a lot of ways.
Like they're just real heavy duty float 

2318
01:48:11,571 --> 01:48:16,161
lab uses the aligning that they use when
they make Koi ponds that real thick 

2319
01:48:16,201 --> 01:48:21,201
rubber lining.
So that was a big problem with the 

2320
01:48:21,201 --> 01:48:22,290
Cemati tanks was that the lining would 
burn out because uh,

2321
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:27,291
occasionally you get like a hole in it 
and then some water would get through 

2322
01:48:27,291 --> 01:48:31,671
and it would get on the heating element.
They would short circuit and burned 

2323
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:32,370
through and then it would flood.
That happened to me.

2324
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:33,990
My,
my basement got flooded.

2325
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:39,910
Yeah.
So this guy guys figured out a way 

2326
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:41,430
around that no lining at all.
And instead they use A.

2327
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:46,470
I'm like the same sort of manufacturing 
principles that you would make a boat 

2328
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:48,750
out of.
Why is it so tall?

2329
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:51,510
So you stand in it,
why do you want to stand in it?

2330
01:48:51,570 --> 01:48:56,570
Because you can lie in it.
And then you have to duck when you get 

2331
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:56,700
out or you can just stand up and walk 
out.

2332
01:48:57,090 --> 01:49:00,130
So they just made them taller.
And also you get more air in there.

2333
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:04,890
The float lab ones have buttons that you
can press that circulate the air.

2334
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,950
Like mine has three different speeds.
I can have a little bit of air,

2335
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:12,990
a lot of air or just blows like full 
blast or it get shut it off.

2336
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:17,310
So you could circulate some air inside 
the chamber while you're in it.

2337
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:20,910
Most of the time I have that off,
but you can turn it on.

2338
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:25,230
It also helps to cool your body off a 
little bit because sometimes you can get

2339
01:49:25,231 --> 01:49:30,231
a little sweaty.
Like it's hard to get the shut that 

2340
01:49:30,231 --> 01:49:33,780
fucking phone watch nonsense off.
Take it off man.

2341
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:36,450
He can't.
He can't.

2342
01:49:36,451 --> 01:49:37,290
Dang.
Every hour.

2343
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:42,291
That's just retarded.
Have you haven't done the years is due 

2344
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:42,291
every hour.
Like a clock.

2345
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:45,870
That was my alarm system here.
You're exactly at 4:00.

2346
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:48,010
You haven't done the music or isn't it 
yet,

2347
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,710
have you?
No,

2348
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,060
no,
no,

2349
01:49:49,061 --> 01:49:51,620
no.
Are you interested in trying that much?

2350
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:52,930
But no.
It's interesting,

2351
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:54,670
I just haven't gotten down to their 
place.

2352
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,190
I only use the tank that I have,
but if I would definitely try it.

2353
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:02,550
What he's done with the music thing is 
figuring out how to wait to have these 

2354
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:05,161
floating waterproof speakers that are 
right next to your ears and they 

2355
01:50:05,161 --> 01:50:09,331
literally make the water vibrates so you
feel music in your feet and your skin.

2356
01:50:09,851 --> 01:50:14,851
You feel it in your balls,
like you feel the music and the water 

2357
01:50:14,851 --> 01:50:18,281
and it's supposed to be incredible.
It's supposed to be like some real next 

2358
01:50:18,281 --> 01:50:20,660
level shit.
If you're cute.

2359
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:22,110
I didn't even really need that.
Those wouldn't.

2360
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,610
Binaural beats I would imagine.
You can get some interesting.

2361
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:25,600
Oh yeah,
stuff.

2362
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:27,040
Didn't you just get frozen the other 
day?

2363
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:28,540
Jamie did the crypto thing.

2364
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,980
How was it?
It was great.

2365
01:50:29,981 --> 01:50:31,780
It was cool.
It wasn't genuine.

2366
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:34,900
It was a bit like what I would expect if
a torturous.

2367
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:37,420
Does it feel like torture?
No physical be tortured?

2368
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,700
No.
Uh,

2369
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:40,720
I was just playing a mind game with 
myself.

2370
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:43,570
I only went for two minutes and they put
music which help go do it.

2371
01:50:43,571 --> 01:50:44,280
Man.
I,

2372
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:46,270
I wouldn't mind it.
Let's do it.

2373
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:48,640
Let's do it right after this.
It was just like a little mind game.

2374
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,320
They're playing led Zeppelin,
so I'd like,

2375
01:50:50,321 --> 01:50:55,321
you know,
there's music and it's only two minutes 

2376
01:50:55,321 --> 01:50:57,481
so you know,
it's not a full song so you're just 

2377
01:50:57,481 --> 01:50:57,481
like,
alright,

2378
01:50:57,481 --> 01:50:58,300
it sucks for the first 30 seconds I even
know what you're expecting.

2379
01:50:58,301 --> 01:50:59,150
And then it's like,
all right,

2380
01:50:59,151 --> 01:50:59,830
I'm here,
I'm here,

2381
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:01,330
this is cool.
But like Rhonda,

2382
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:03,490
Patrick Number,
your body gets used to it.

2383
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,860
So like when you're doing it,
you did those two minutes,

2384
01:51:05,861 --> 01:51:06,790
felt like an eternity.

2385
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:09,220
After awhile.
Three minutes feels pretty easy.

2386
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:11,860
He just sits down there no more than 
three.

2387
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:12,720
Right.
That's like the.

2388
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:15,850
I've done three slash 20 simone I've 
ever done three minutes.

2389
01:51:15,851 --> 01:51:17,530
Twenty seconds.
It gets hairy.

2390
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:22,650
Those last 20 seconds get a little air.
Is there any part of your body that acs 

2391
01:51:22,650 --> 01:51:26,130
does something that you've noticed?
Like your butthole for free shot or 

2392
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:27,880
dizzy or decor?
Like kind of know your legs,

2393
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:30,070
shake your legs,
start shaking.

2394
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:32,020
It wasn't as cold as I thought it would 
be honest.

2395
01:51:32,021 --> 01:51:37,021
I thought it would be unbearably cold.
I've been in cold situations before and 

2396
01:51:37,021 --> 01:51:41,461
it's just as cold as you get sick balls.
Like did they get the tight or you know 

2397
01:51:41,741 --> 01:51:42,550
what I mean?
Like when your,

2398
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:47,760
like when your balls are talking about 
your testicles and know that you're 

2399
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,010
wearing underwear,
but your um,

2400
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:50,860
what happens is your body at first is 
like,

2401
01:51:50,861 --> 01:51:54,010
Holy Shit and it doesn't feel that cold,
but it feels like,

2402
01:51:54,011 --> 01:51:55,570
oh my God,
but you can stand it.

2403
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:58,480
But after a couple minutes it reveals 
itself.

2404
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:01,330
You hit three minutes and it reveals 
itself.

2405
01:52:01,331 --> 01:52:02,800
You're like,
oh my God.

2406
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:07,801
Like it reaches a level of cold,
like where your body can't keep itself 

2407
01:52:07,801 --> 01:52:08,080
warm anymore.
And your body also,

2408
01:52:08,081 --> 01:52:13,081
your blood has retreated your buds 
retreating to your core to try to 

2409
01:52:13,081 --> 01:52:14,890
protect your dancing Oregon time,
like just side to side to side step.

2410
01:52:14,891 --> 01:52:19,891
And then do you have a sensor on or in 
any way they're detecting your heart 

2411
01:52:19,891 --> 01:52:20,830
rate to make sure you're not,
like you're right there.

2412
01:52:20,831 --> 01:52:25,831
They could see you through the glass and
you could always leave anytime you want 

2413
01:52:25,831 --> 01:52:26,340
and walk out the door.
The door's right next to you.

2414
01:52:26,341 --> 01:52:27,700
It's not a hard to open.
Just push it.

2415
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:32,701
You stand out.
The problem with it is if you touch the 

2416
01:52:33,221 --> 01:52:35,200
walls,
you could definitely get some frost bite

2417
01:52:35,201 --> 01:52:36,670
you gotta.
Make sure you don't touch the walls.

2418
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:39,490
You gotta stand in the center.
Don't,

2419
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:44,520
don't touch anything with your skin 
because you know it's not a lot of room 

2420
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,190
to move and it's 270 degrees below zero

2421
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,110
shits.
No joke.

2422
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:50,140
It wasn't at.
It could be scary.

2423
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:52,480
You're building yourself up more in like
a haunted house,

2424
01:52:52,481 --> 01:52:54,700
like it's not that bad when you should 
get some of that scary dude.

2425
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:59,940
It's freaky.
I just don't like being in situations 

2426
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:02,101
where what if this door accidentally 
it's breaks and they have to open it in 

2427
01:53:02,101 --> 01:53:02,980
10 minutes or I die.
You could open it.

2428
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:04,060
It's not hard,
man.

2429
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,160
Just pushes.
Doesn't have a knob.

2430
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:09,220
It just pushes shot and closes.
Got a little handle on it.

2431
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:11,410
It's not even like being in a cooler at 
a restaurant.

2432
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:16,470
It's not.
That's what I'm thinking is super easy 

2433
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:16,470
to open.
It opens pretty easy.

2434
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:17,530
It opens easy,
but it's really weird.

2435
01:53:18,130 --> 01:53:19,120
But afterwards,
man,

2436
01:53:19,121 --> 01:53:21,040
you feel amazing.
Didn't you feel great?

2437
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,130
I felt,
I don't know.

2438
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:25,210
I'm not sure if it was.
I drank coffee later that night,

2439
01:53:25,211 --> 01:53:29,020
but it kept me up like I had way more 
energy than I usually do on a given day.

2440
01:53:29,021 --> 01:53:29,260
Yeah.

2441
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:34,480
Well with Dr Patrick said it's 
Epinephrin and then your brain produces 

2442
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:38,861
it and also cold shock proteins.
They produce all this anti inflammatory 

2443
01:53:38,861 --> 01:53:42,911
response and the way it makes your brain
feels very interesting the way it makes 

2444
01:53:42,911 --> 01:53:44,690
your whole body feel like you feel 
great.

2445
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,130
Like you have to get out of it.
You're like,

2446
01:53:46,131 --> 01:53:48,140
Whoa,
God damn.

2447
01:53:48,141 --> 01:53:51,740
You feel good.
And you know the physical benefits of it

2448
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:57,430
I think.
I think for anybody who works out and 

2449
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:57,430
lift weights and does anything where 
you're,

2450
01:53:57,430 --> 01:54:01,780
you know,
we have soreness and inflammation and 

2451
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:01,780
apparently for people that have 
arthritis,

2452
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,410
it offers a lot of,
a lot of help,

2453
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,390
a lot of assistance for people that have
that.

2454
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,440
I just fucking love it.

2455
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:11,700
You have never taken an ice bath though,
so I don't supposed to be just as good 

2456
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:11,730
or better jobs.
It's better.

2457
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:16,970
I don't think ice baths or really easy 
for a lot of people just to do because 

2458
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:17,880
you know,
they'll just have it at the gym list.

2459
01:54:17,881 --> 01:54:20,270
They have a hold on their spotlight.
They're starting to have for cryotherapy

2460
01:54:20,410 --> 01:54:23,110
for everyone to have an ice bath,
but it's 15 minutes to.

2461
01:54:23,111 --> 01:54:28,111
That's what you supposed to do.
Sometimes people do 20 shop says it's 

2462
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:29,440
better.
He says the ice bath gives him like more

2463
01:54:29,441 --> 01:54:34,441
relief than the tank and also a wim Hoff
said the ice bath has some benefits of 

2464
01:54:36,731 --> 01:54:41,731
the tank.
Wouldn't have because you learn how to 

2465
01:54:41,731 --> 01:54:44,611
breathe in those 15 minutes.
It's a long time as opposed to like the 

2466
01:54:44,611 --> 01:54:45,070
three minutes,
like the,

2467
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:48,340
the,
the cooling tanks,

2468
01:54:48,341 --> 01:54:49,660
the,
the crowd,

2469
01:54:49,661 --> 01:54:52,570
Janet Chambers.
When you get in them right as they start

2470
01:54:52,571 --> 01:54:53,500
to soc,
it's over,

2471
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:59,220
but when you get that ice bath,
I think that sucks from the jump and I 

2472
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:02,530
think learning how to calm yourself in 
the sock is what's what it's all about.

2473
01:55:02,531 --> 01:55:07,531
Like there's a.
You get the same Epinephrin I bet maybe 

2474
01:55:07,531 --> 01:55:10,611
you get more because you're in that tank
for a long time with that ice water in 

2475
01:55:10,611 --> 01:55:10,990
there for 20 minutes,
so who knows?

2476
01:55:10,990 --> 01:55:15,990
You might get a bigger purse of that 
Epinephrin and from people that have 

2477
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:17,740
done it,
they say that it's more relief from like

2478
01:55:17,741 --> 01:55:20,140
soreness.
Like Brendan swears.

2479
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:24,100
That's more relief and make sense to me.
I haven't done it so I can't comment.

2480
01:55:24,190 --> 01:55:26,050
I should probably do it just so I know 
the difference.

2481
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:28,780
I'll just probably do it.
I should probably have a good workout,

2482
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:32,230
like lift some weights or something and 
then go do it and see if periscope it.

2483
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:33,430
Yeah,
maybe I should.

2484
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:38,920
Yeah,
I probably should because I do the tank 

2485
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:38,920
so often.
I should probably know,

2486
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:43,290
but I know that the first time I started
hearing people talk about how you feel 

2487
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:44,040
when

2488
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,340
you get out though was when people were 
doing the sensory deprivation tank.

2489
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:52,820
I never heard about people saying they 
felt good when they got out of the ice 

2490
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:53,640
bath.
They were like happy it was over,

2491
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:55,920
but I don't remember people saying they 
felt good.

2492
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:58,620
I wonder if it requires a certain 
temperature.

2493
01:55:58,621 --> 01:56:03,621
You experience.
She probably already talked about this 

2494
01:56:03,621 --> 01:56:03,621
and we forgot it.
Right.

2495
01:56:03,621 --> 01:56:05,100
I would imagine she had a temperature in
there.

2496
01:56:05,101 --> 01:56:06,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

2497
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,670
She fast.
Too much fucking information.

2498
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:11,280
They can't keep up.
She does it with no notes either.

2499
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:16,281
By the way folks,
she'll have like a notebook that she 

2500
01:56:16,281 --> 01:56:17,580
never looks at and she's rattling off 
all that information with no notes.

2501
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:22,640
She said one of the few people that I've
ever met that makes me feel really 

2502
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:22,640
fucking stupid,
you know,

2503
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:26,130
I think I asked her three times 
separately after that podcast like,

2504
01:56:26,131 --> 01:56:27,910
okay,
please explain to me like I'm five,

2505
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:28,980
this sauna thing.

2506
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:29,970
Yeah.
I'm doing it right.

2507
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:30,600
Right,
right.

2508
01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:32,170
Ten minutes is good.
Yeah.

2509
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:37,800
Okay.
But there's a few people that have 

2510
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,161
talked to,
I feel like really fucking stupid while 

2511
01:56:40,161 --> 01:56:40,161
I'm talking to them where I'm just 
trying to like,

2512
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:40,850
like,
uh,

2513
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:45,390
what is it like on your planet?
How do you time travel?

2514
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:48,840
What do you know about us and did you 
create us?

2515
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:52,800
Your questions are valid.
I will answer them now.

2516
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,310
Um,
who else makes me feel that stupid?

2517
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:59,260
Nailed a cross tastes and he makes me 
feel that stupid.

2518
01:56:59,270 --> 01:57:00,000
Uh,
Peter Schiff,

2519
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:02,500
he made me feel pretty stupid.
Um,

2520
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:03,840
you know,
who made me feel pretty stupid.

2521
01:57:03,841 --> 01:57:05,250
I still don't understand what the fuck 
he said.

2522
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:08,130
Was that physicists dude?
I met cost Goswami?

2523
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:09,450
Yes.
Yeah,

2524
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,760
Dr.
Goswami man.

2525
01:57:11,761 --> 01:57:16,761
To this day I will have,
I'll put on that podcast is try to grab 

2526
01:57:16,761 --> 01:57:20,871
it.
Try to figure out what he was saying he 

2527
01:57:20,871 --> 01:57:21,990
was talking about like he was,
he's a quantum physicist.

2528
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:26,991
Is that how you describe them?
Or string of quantum theory and string 

2529
01:57:26,991 --> 01:57:27,840
theory and whoa man.
That stuff is like,

2530
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:32,280
hold the fuck on.
What are you even saying like that stuff

2531
01:57:32,281 --> 01:57:36,510
is so far out the deep band as far as 
like how to grasp it.

2532
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:39,120
You hear that guy describing things and 
you're like,

2533
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,030
what?
Huh?

2534
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:47,460
He's a little too smart.
He's cool and he doesn't give a fuck who

2535
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:49,800
wear a hat with a tie.
It's when it's kangaroo hats,

2536
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:51,180
right?
It's like run DMC.

2537
01:57:51,181 --> 01:57:56,181
Shit can go over.
This guy is like giving a speech at a 

2538
01:57:56,181 --> 01:57:57,180
college and he's got a fucking,
like a sock hat on.

2539
01:57:58,790 --> 01:58:03,180
What a weird hat to have as a professor,
but I think those dudes,

2540
01:58:03,181 --> 01:58:08,181
they don't give a fuck like their 
version of reality is so it's so,

2541
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:15,290
it's,
they're looking at the universe on this 

2542
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:19,880
almost impossible to measure level and 
there's only a few of them that 

2543
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:24,321
understand the mathematics involved when
they started drawing all that 

2544
01:58:24,321 --> 01:58:28,431
mathematical stuff for quantum theory,
when they started drawing on those 

2545
01:58:28,431 --> 01:58:29,670
yellow legal pads and they sit in the 
park and do it.

2546
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:35,010
If you left that there and you gave the 
next 400 people a million dollars,

2547
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:40,030
tell you what it is,
no one's going to know what the fuck 

2548
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:40,030
that is.

2549
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:40,110
You could write in Japanese and you 
could say,

2550
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:42,220
uh,
if someone can read this,

2551
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:47,400
you get a million dollars.
Someone's going to show up almost 

2552
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,711
immediately and read that.
There's a lot of people that speak 

2553
01:58:49,711 --> 01:58:49,930
Japanese.
This very few people understand what the

2554
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:54,960
fuck those guys are writing when they're
writing all those crazy numbers and 

2555
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,420
letters and squeal lines.
And I watched Brian Cox and um,

2556
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:01,150
I forget who the other scientists was,
but when I did Brian Cox,

2557
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:06,151
his podcast,
he's another one that makes me feel 

2558
01:59:06,151 --> 01:59:06,151
stupid as fuck.
Maybe this,

2559
01:59:06,151 --> 01:59:11,040
these guys were talking,
they were talking about like those 

2560
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,070
equations and they were talking about 
gravity and I was like,

2561
01:59:12,071 --> 01:59:14,500
what are you,
why are you even doing up there?

2562
01:59:14,501 --> 01:59:15,780
Is that real?
Like,

2563
01:59:16,110 --> 01:59:17,740
no,
you have no idea.

2564
01:59:17,741 --> 01:59:19,570
They're making these squiggles and all 
these lines.

2565
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:22,000
And to them it's like,
of course course,

2566
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:23,760
don't forget the little squiggle with 
the a,

2567
01:59:23,761 --> 01:59:26,330
like that kind of shit.
I didn't know you had a pod.

2568
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:32,460
It's hilarious because they enjoy doing 
it too because it's like a cool little 

2569
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:33,400
language that they know.
So few people know,

2570
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:36,880
like the language of that complex,
those equations.

2571
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:39,820
It's like almost,
it's like some crazy foreign

2572
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:44,840
alien language like that.
Only a few people know how to speak.

2573
01:59:44,990 --> 01:59:49,910
Like they're doing all these equations 
and trying to prove that at its smallest

2574
01:59:49,911 --> 01:59:54,911
level the universe is made out of 
something that's like strings and they 

2575
01:59:55,521 --> 01:59:59,720
vibrate at different frequencies and 
that's what creates matter.

2576
01:59:59,721 --> 02:00:01,830
And what,
what,

2577
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:04,520
what,
what are you guys talking about?

2578
02:00:04,521 --> 02:00:09,521
And then they started talking about 
subatomic particles and how they react 

2579
02:00:09,521 --> 02:00:13,781
when being viewed or not viewed.
And what the fuck are you saying?

2580
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:21,520
You know,
I mean that's why that guy doesn't give 

2581
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:21,520
a fuck.
You wear a sock hat.

2582
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,880
Like who cares?
This is all just strings.

2583
02:00:22,881 --> 02:00:26,030
Like you guys don't even know this.
You don't even know what you're involved

2584
02:00:26,031 --> 02:00:28,040
in.
You guys are playing this game.

2585
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:33,300
You know you're sitting here wondering 
if it's going to be Donald Trump or ted 

2586
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:35,120
Cruz to the Republican nomination and 
everybody the,

2587
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:40,260
the balance of the country that this guy
is studying strings that we can't see.

2588
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:42,810
Maybe they're the biggest bullshit 
artists.

2589
02:00:42,811 --> 02:00:47,811
And they were just so confused that we 
don't question like they all decided to 

2590
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:52,080
keep their mouth shut.
Like it's been going on forever.

2591
02:00:52,081 --> 02:00:54,510
Like Einstein with created this like,
hey,

2592
02:00:54,511 --> 02:00:56,730
I figured out a way.
We don't really have to have real jobs.

2593
02:00:56,731 --> 02:00:58,440
We just talked crazy shit about strings.

2594
02:00:59,370 --> 02:01:01,240
It is,
anything's possible.

2595
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:04,780
But I have a feeling that's not what 
happened.

2596
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:07,480
I have a feeling because they're 
teaching it still.

2597
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:08,640
It's not like,
nope,

2598
02:01:08,650 --> 02:01:13,650
no more,
we're just gonna just between you and I 

2599
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:13,950
know it's going to die with us.
No,

2600
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:16,750
they teach it,
you know that those high level equations

2601
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:21,751
and that kind of physics and stuff 
that's available at universities at the 

2602
02:01:21,751 --> 02:01:22,750
highest level.
So it's got to be a real thing.

2603
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,010
What if they,
just to arguments sake,

2604
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:26,690
what if they found one of those things 
to be wrong?

2605
02:01:26,691 --> 02:01:27,670
They have to stop teaching it.

2606
02:01:27,870 --> 02:01:32,870
It's the right thing with that,
which has happened since we've been in 

2607
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,870
school.
You know,

2608
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:33,150
they've taught us things that they found
out weren't true.

2609
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:34,470
Okay.
Yeah.

2610
02:01:34,471 --> 02:01:37,910
But that's because they get new data and
part of the reason why they get new data

2611
02:01:37,911 --> 02:01:39,770
is because they were going over these.
Sure,

2612
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:40,760
man,
there's,

2613
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:45,880
it's part of the whole idea that's so 
supposedly so beautiful is that 

2614
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:50,680
knowledge is like self correcting and 
when more knowledge comes about,

2615
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:55,751
when we learn new things and we have new
discoveries and we have new information 

2616
02:01:55,751 --> 02:01:58,010
that we add to,
it sort of changes the view of how we're

2617
02:01:58,011 --> 02:02:00,170
looking at things like it's self 
correcting,

2618
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:01,990
you know,
it's,

2619
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:07,030
it becomes a problem if someone's 
resisting it because they don't want to 

2620
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,320
appear that they were incorrect all 
these years,

2621
02:02:07,321 --> 02:02:10,700
that that's a giant problem and that's 
an ego problem that humans have.

2622
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,460
Humans,
they just have that problem.

2623
02:02:13,461 --> 02:02:18,461
Even if they were teaching to the best 
of their ability and their are doing an 

2624
02:02:18,471 --> 02:02:20,900
amazing job with what information that 
they had.

2625
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:23,810
If something comes out that contradicts 
with someone's been teaching,

2626
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:26,420
boy they fucking resist the shit out of 
that.

2627
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:29,540
It becomes a problem like archeology a 
little bit.

2628
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:31,810
Seen it with some of those,
uh,

2629
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:36,850
Egypt guys like as they try to introduce
the possibilities of civilizations that 

2630
02:02:37,521 --> 02:02:40,760
were very complex and building giant 
stone structures like deep,

2631
02:02:40,761 --> 02:02:42,650
deep into our past,
like 14,000

2632
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:47,651
plus years ago when they started,
when the mall of this evidence starts 

2633
02:02:47,651 --> 02:02:50,951
coming out,
they're still resisting the idea that 

2634
02:02:50,951 --> 02:02:50,951
Egypt is older than,
than what it is.

2635
02:02:50,951 --> 02:02:54,020
And this is kind of John Anthony West.
I know we've had them on that guy.

2636
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:58,090
If you haven't heard this subject before
and you're not interested or you are not

2637
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:03,100
educated about Egypt and its history,
its guys get this insane documentary 

2638
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:03,720
series.
It's,

2639
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:05,880
it's.
I mean obviously it's,

2640
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:10,700
it's a DVD and it's only a,
an hour or couple hours long and there's

2641
02:03:10,701 --> 02:03:13,430
six of them though and it's a whole 
series of them.

2642
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:16,970
I mean the way this guy did it is so 
good.

2643
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:22,420
He's so good at explaining it and he's 
so passionate about Egypt and he's so 

2644
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:26,831
passionate about the architecture and 
showing like how much complexity there 

2645
02:03:26,831 --> 02:03:29,840
is and it's six fucking hours or more 
than six hours.

2646
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:30,920
Six Dvds,
right.

2647
02:03:30,921 --> 02:03:33,140
Is that what it is?
Each one and our magical Egypt?

2648
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:34,330
Yes,
that's it.

2649
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,430
I think he's got an magical Egypt to 
that.

2650
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:42,230
He just came out with two,
but this guy is just obsessed with Egypt

2651
02:03:42,231 --> 02:03:47,020
and he knows so much about it,
but some of his evidence that they tried

2652
02:03:47,021 --> 02:03:52,021
to show to these archeologists to open 
up the possibility that we're not just 

2653
02:03:52,021 --> 02:03:56,831
looking when they're looking at Egypt,
they're not just looking at one 

2654
02:03:56,831 --> 02:03:57,860
civilization that was advanced that was 
making these incredible structures.

2655
02:03:57,861 --> 02:04:02,861
You might be looking at like several 
generations that are separated by 

2656
02:04:02,861 --> 02:04:06,611
thousands of years.
Like this might have been an area where 

2657
02:04:06,611 --> 02:04:10,631
there's been like a one construction 
style that went on for thousands of 

2658
02:04:10,631 --> 02:04:11,840
years and they had another one after 
that.

2659
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
It might have been new people took over.
Like there's a lot of crazy shit 

2660
02:04:17,241 --> 02:04:22,241
happened in Egypt.
Like the face of the Pharaoh is 

2661
02:04:22,241 --> 02:04:25,340
apparently an African face and that's 
after the new bins.

2662
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:30,520
Conquered that part of Egypt.
So what happens when the New Orleans 

2663
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:35,261
came up and conquered Egypt,
they decided to take that Sphinx and 

2664
02:04:35,261 --> 02:04:38,130
carbon African head into it.
So they made the Pharaoh,

2665
02:04:38,131 --> 02:04:40,620
whoever the pharaohs the time,
some bad motherfucker,

2666
02:04:40,621 --> 02:04:42,240
dude,
he's the ultimate pimp.

2667
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:44,670
He turned alliance faces like,
yeah,

2668
02:04:44,671 --> 02:04:46,860
the line that's been here for about 
10,000

2669
02:04:46,861 --> 02:04:48,780
years,
dog man,

2670
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:50,940
I think my face look better update and 
that line,

2671
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:56,080
he had carved his face into a giant 
existing statue and the existing statute

2672
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:01,590
might have been there as long as like 
10,000

2673
02:05:01,591 --> 02:05:06,591
BC.
Like they think that statute might be 

2674
02:05:06,591 --> 02:05:09,381
old as fuck and that this guy carved his
head into it like way after it had been 

2675
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:13,650
made.
There's all sorts of cool evidence about

2676
02:05:13,651 --> 02:05:18,651
that.
Two men that people are reluctant to 

2677
02:05:18,651 --> 02:05:20,390
consider.
Some of it is these Fisher marks in 

2678
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:20,390
these canyon walls.

2679
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:23,720
It's only been created by only could 
have been created by thousands of years 

2680
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:27,171
of rainfall.
And there's this guy from Boston 

2681
02:05:27,171 --> 02:05:30,590
University,
Dr Robert Schoch who started proposing 

2682
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:31,590
all these ideas.
If you have anybody's ever interested in

2683
02:05:31,591 --> 02:05:36,591
this kind of stuff,
magical Egypt is the shit I'm telling 

2684
02:05:36,591 --> 02:05:36,591
you.
It's amazing.

2685
02:05:36,591 --> 02:05:38,880
I watched nothing bet that for months 
straight.

2686
02:05:38,910 --> 02:05:42,520
I watched it several times.
So good dude.

2687
02:05:42,521 --> 02:05:45,540
They were so advanced.
Fuck,

2688
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:50,370
I mean they were making some crazy shit 
even if they are right,

2689
02:05:50,371 --> 02:05:54,990
even if the egyptologists are 100 
percent correct that we're still talking

2690
02:05:54,991 --> 02:05:58,110
about 5,000
years ago,

2691
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:00,570
4,500
plus years ago,

2692
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:05,810
we're talking about like 2,500
BC and they were making some insane 

2693
02:06:05,810 --> 02:06:10,491
shit.
So even if John Anthony West is wrong 

2694
02:06:10,491 --> 02:06:12,861
and it all comes from the same era,
it still in fucking insane how much 

2695
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:18,290
information is available right now.
We could see like how mathematically 

2696
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:22,881
complex structures where these people 
are doing this and they're making these 

2697
02:06:22,881 --> 02:06:27,680
immensely complicated structures at the 
very earliest or the very most recent 

2698
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,350
2,500
BC.

2699
02:06:32,070 --> 02:06:34,650
Fucking crazy.
I mean that.

2700
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:39,670
It's crazy and they think the African 
faces even more recent than that student

2701
02:06:41,211 --> 02:06:46,211
came along,
just jack that town and put his fucking 

2702
02:06:46,211 --> 02:06:47,370
face on the line.
I hope that happens to see the statue of

2703
02:06:47,371 --> 02:06:52,371
Liberty.
If what if our statue of Liberty gets 

2704
02:06:52,371 --> 02:06:52,800
blacked out?
It could if Kanye,

2705
02:06:52,801 --> 02:06:55,770
because president,
he'll demand to be the new face on Mount

2706
02:06:55,770 --> 02:06:57,000
Rushmore for sure.
Totally.

2707
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:58,200
One hundred percent,
100 percent,

2708
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,910
100 percent Tommaso,
she'll,

2709
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:04,970
she'll want to be on that as well,
and that's when we'll know that the 

2710
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:05,040
human race is a giant failure.
It just didn't work out.

2711
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:10,460
We got to capable before we got smart 
because the really capable people,

2712
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:16,580
the people that have figured out how to 
allow us to manipulate matter and 

2713
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:18,270
exchange information,
the people that earn that,

2714
02:07:18,330 --> 02:07:19,950
they were super,
super intelligent,

2715
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:24,240
but then they took that and they gave 
that power to us.

2716
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:27,240
They gave it to the masses.
Hashtag Dick.

2717
02:07:27,241 --> 02:07:31,910
Game strong.
Say what they did was they.

2718
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:34,950
They made something that we don't 
deserve.

2719
02:07:35,530 --> 02:07:35,980
We don't

2720
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,560
deserve this.
It's too good.

2721
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,360
It's too crazy.
I mean,

2722
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:43,360
it's like we're not ready for this level
of power.

2723
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
That's what's happening.
Hashtags going to find a way onto our 

2724
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,020
currency.
At one point,

2725
02:07:50,021 --> 02:07:52,080
pretty soon there's going to be like 
Hashtag Dick,

2726
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:53,950
game stress Kanye or something like 
that.

2727
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:56,740
Hashtag feel the burn that's out there,
right?

2728
02:07:57,280 --> 02:08:00,580
Hashtag make America great again.
So trump is,

2729
02:08:00,581 --> 02:08:05,581
what is his letters to give up on 1:40,
1:40.

2730
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:09,370
You want to keep America great again or 
make America great again.

2731
02:08:09,670 --> 02:08:11,620
So many hashtags are too many letters,
right?

2732
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:15,010
Too many characters who you vote for 
Brian,

2733
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:17,350
burning man,
burning all the way.

2734
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:22,351
I just think he represents common sense 
and that's the one thing that I like 

2735
02:08:22,351 --> 02:08:26,491
about him.
He just seems like a normal person 

2736
02:08:26,491 --> 02:08:26,491
talking like you're talking to Ari or 
something.

2737
02:08:26,491 --> 02:08:26,491
Oh,
exit.

2738
02:08:26,491 --> 02:08:27,190
I agree.
I agree.

2739
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:31,000
And I also think like the fact that he's
not taking money from banks.

2740
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:36,570
Like you know,
when he was asking Hillary to give a 

2741
02:08:36,570 --> 02:08:39,721
transcript,
the speeches that she gave when she was 

2742
02:08:39,721 --> 02:08:39,870
getting paid a quarter million bucks to 
talk to these bankers.

2743
02:08:40,210 --> 02:08:42,580
I mean,
that's a reasonable request.

2744
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:45,640
If you're going to be the president,
that's a reasonable request.

2745
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:46,840
And he goes,
you know,

2746
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:51,860
I'll tell you,
I'll give you all the transcripts from 

2747
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:55,040
what I spoke in front of those bankers 
because there are non.

2748
02:08:57,150 --> 02:08:58,480
He's good at it.
Man.

2749
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:01,330
Did you see Larry David Play Him Bernie?
No,

2750
02:09:01,331 --> 02:09:02,500
I haven't seen it.
Oh my God.

2751
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:05,470
It's some of the best.
They're identical twins.

2752
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:07,330
It's crazy.
That's funny.

2753
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:08,590
Larry.
David's a genius.

2754
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:11,560
I love to just see the Garry shandling 
died,

2755
02:09:12,170 --> 02:09:13,420
Huh?
Yeah.

2756
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:14,760
You see the socks?
Yeah.

2757
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:17,920
Fucked up man.
Sixty six years old.

2758
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:22,950
That's all right.
We were talking about before the 

2759
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:22,950
podcast.
What were you saying?

2760
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:22,950
That there was a limo that was at his 
driveway.

2761
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:25,420
Didn't report on TMZ that said that he 
had missed.

2762
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:29,910
He had like was feeling sick the night 
before called a doctor friend of his had

2763
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:30,400
totaled my.
Yeah,

2764
02:09:30,401 --> 02:09:31,720
he should probably go to the hospital 
tomorrow.

2765
02:09:31,721 --> 02:09:32,140
He's like,
okay,

2766
02:09:32,141 --> 02:09:37,141
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow.
So apparently he had booked a car 

2767
02:09:37,141 --> 02:09:38,590
service take taken to the hospital,
but before that car had picked them up.

2768
02:09:38,950 --> 02:09:42,590
He had already had to call nine one one 
because he was distressed and then.

2769
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:48,790
Wow Man.
Yeah.

2770
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:51,280
That came out of nowhere.
You know that that was not.

2771
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:55,900
I hadn't thought about him being sick or
I didn't know him.

2772
02:09:56,250 --> 02:09:57,880
I only met him once.
He's very nice.

2773
02:09:57,881 --> 02:09:58,360
No,
met him.

2774
02:09:58,710 --> 02:10:01,270
I met him at the comedy Magic Club.
I didn't know him,

2775
02:10:01,271 --> 02:10:02,350
but damn,
he was funny.

2776
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:04,030
He was funny,
man.

2777
02:10:04,031 --> 02:10:09,031
That Larry Sanders show was a hilarious 
show and that's the show that got Paul 

2778
02:10:09,031 --> 02:10:12,760
Sim started,
who was the executive producer of news 

2779
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:14,791
radio and the creative news radio.
He got his start in the Larry Sanders 

2780
02:10:14,791 --> 02:10:15,580
show.
Um,

2781
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:23,670
I mean,
I feel like a feel like it's awful and 

2782
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:24,640
everything that he died and especially,
you know,

2783
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:27,010
66.
It's not even that old or 62.

2784
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:28,310
How old was he?
60 six.

2785
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,310
Sixty six,
you know?

2786
02:10:30,311 --> 02:10:34,070
But I think um,
I would least rather than I think

2787
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:37,460
than the Robin Williams thing,
Robin Williams Swan was such a bummer to

2788
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:38,300
me.
It's weird.

2789
02:10:38,301 --> 02:10:43,301
We're living in a weird time where 
everyone we know is dying because all 

2790
02:10:43,301 --> 02:10:45,380
the people that were TV stars and people
that like movie stars,

2791
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:50,000
like of our generations are dying.
Like Robin Williams dead.

2792
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:52,400
Are you kidding me?
Name Nancy Reagan's dead.

2793
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:57,490
What the fuck?
I thought I couldn't believe Nancy 

2794
02:10:57,490 --> 02:10:58,500
Reagan was alive when she died.
I was like,

2795
02:10:58,501 --> 02:10:58,550
yeah,

2796
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:01,660
just tied.
Um,

2797
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:03,240
yeah man.
There's been some weird ones.

2798
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:08,300
The weirdest one is one who had died.
It's a burt reynolds to me because when 

2799
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:10,710
I was a kid,
burt reynolds was smokey and the bandit,

2800
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:15,740
like he was so cool.
I remember he would drive that Trans am 

2801
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:20,600
and he had that mustache and everybody 
wanted to be burt reynolds who's always 

2802
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:24,060
laughing and smiling and you're like,
God Damn Burt Reynolds is the shit dude.

2803
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:29,210
Those smokey and the bandit days,
he was like the ultimate having a great 

2804
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:31,500
time guy because he was always smiling.
His movies.

2805
02:11:31,501 --> 02:11:34,710
It wasn't getting mad at anybody.
He always had that silly mustache.

2806
02:11:34,711 --> 02:11:39,711
He's smiling and drive around in his car
and hanging out with sally field back 

2807
02:11:39,711 --> 02:11:39,810
when she was hot.
That was him all the time.

2808
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:43,710
Just great sense of humor and always 
smiling.

2809
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:46,350
He's a bad ass.
They were great movies,

2810
02:11:46,351 --> 02:11:47,710
man nights.

2811
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:50,370
Dude.
Burt Reynolds is the shit.

2812
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:52,180
Especially back then.
He looked,

2813
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:54,900
he was the shit.
But um,

2814
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:56,780
there was an episode of that,
um,

2815
02:11:56,990 --> 02:11:59,010
garage.
A gas monkeys.

2816
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:01,410
So it is gas monkey garage.
What's that?

2817
02:12:01,411 --> 02:12:05,610
Fucking fast and loose fast and fast and
loud.

2818
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:06,870
Fast and loud.
That's it.

2819
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:09,150
Yeah.
The car show fast and loud.

2820
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:14,420
They built one of those Trans Ams,
like they had a one of those smokey and 

2821
02:12:14,851 --> 02:12:19,851
the bandit trans men.
They were refurbishing it and they met 

2822
02:12:19,851 --> 02:12:19,860
to meet.
They went to meet Burt Reynolds and man,

2823
02:12:19,861 --> 02:12:23,070
he was just struggling even to walk 
here.

2824
02:12:23,160 --> 02:12:25,970
You can actually find Jamie just pulled 
it up and you know this,

2825
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:31,020
these guys,
they showed up at burt's place and when 

2826
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:31,020
he comes out,
man,

2827
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:32,250
you see him walk in and like,
look at this.

2828
02:12:33,010 --> 02:12:38,010
See he's got a cane and he can.
He's all hunched over like he's 

2829
02:12:38,010 --> 02:12:39,690
physically pretty fucked up.

2830
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:44,930
Was He also in Cannibal run?
So smokey and the bandit was for some 

2831
02:12:44,930 --> 02:12:47,070
reason I always thought those were the 
same movies dude.

2832
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:50,460
And he was awesome in his first movie or
his first big movie,

2833
02:12:50,461 --> 02:12:53,790
which is deliverance.
Do Deliverance was amazing.

2834
02:12:53,791 --> 02:12:54,750
We see him here.
Look at him.

2835
02:12:54,751 --> 02:12:56,670
He's,
he's hurting man.

2836
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:57,750
He's hurting.
See,

2837
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,400
seen walking up.
To me,

2838
02:12:59,401 --> 02:13:01,530
that's crazy.
I'm looking at this and I'm like,

2839
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:06,890
how could this be?
It looks like he's got a back injury or 

2840
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:07,590
he's such a.
he's starting to hunch,

2841
02:13:07,591 --> 02:13:10,540
so hunched over.
He's,

2842
02:13:10,590 --> 02:13:15,590
he looks so.
I'm like just wounded and injured,

2843
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:18,000
you know what I mean?
This whole body's just.

2844
02:13:19,110 --> 02:13:22,980
I always think of him as being that 
fucking lively,

2845
02:13:22,981 --> 02:13:27,981
happy guy.
Time you motherfucker time you evil 

2846
02:13:30,271 --> 02:13:31,980
bitch.
It's

2847
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,980
weird to think about like the people 
that just kind of fell off and I 

2848
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:36,980
completely forget about him.
Like,

2849
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:38,190
like Tim Conway.
Is he alive?

2850
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,680
Brendan Frasier.
Yeah.

2851
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:42,910
The guy from the mummy movies.
Yeah.

2852
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:48,890
Yeah.
There's certain guys that are giant 

2853
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:49,500
movie stars and then they just say,
ah,

2854
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:54,920
I'm just going to stop doing this.
Or Society says it's going to stop 

2855
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:56,040
buying your movies.
One of those happens something.

2856
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,380
Rick Maraniss how he just kind of like.
You quit.

2857
02:13:58,381 --> 02:13:59,010
Yeah.
He just quit.

2858
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:00,450
He said,
I'm good.

2859
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:03,750
You see David Letterman the other date,
that picture of David Letterman.

2860
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:09,020
Oh my God.
It's like a wild man on top of a 

2861
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:11,181
mountain.
It's going to find that sasquatch and I 

2862
02:14:11,181 --> 02:14:15,441
will bring back his head.
I could totally walk by him and not 

2863
02:14:15,441 --> 02:14:15,441
think that's David Letterman at all 
smart,

2864
02:14:15,441 --> 02:14:16,830
but now somebody outed them.
Yeah.

2865
02:14:17,070 --> 02:14:19,080
Fuckers shouldn't out at a man.

2866
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:23,370
I guess if he throws his glasses on it 
even more so.

2867
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:25,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

2868
02:14:25,591 --> 02:14:26,820
If you do,
he's got.

2869
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:30,940
He just kind to have a got to have a new
look to change it to red,

2870
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:32,370
make it all red.
No one will know.

2871
02:14:32,690 --> 02:14:34,850
Look at that.
And if he died it all crazy.

2872
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:40,720
You know,
he looks like somebody that would be in 

2873
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:43,611
a fishermen or boat.
Well he had some serious heart problem 

2874
02:14:43,611 --> 02:14:43,611
too,
right?

2875
02:14:43,611 --> 02:14:44,700
Didn't you have to have surgery?
Yeah.

2876
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:47,600
So along those lines.
Yeah.

2877
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:50,670
He had some serious heart problems that 
gets scary man.

2878
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,380
Look at,
I'm out there jogging and shit.

2879
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:56,670
That's why I can't wait to our body can 
warn us like we'll have like,

2880
02:14:56,710 --> 02:14:59,010
like status lights,
like on my phone.

2881
02:14:59,011 --> 02:15:04,011
Like I get this notification like you 
might be having a blood clot in your 

2882
02:15:04,011 --> 02:15:04,590
left leg.
Are you still doing that diet thing?

2883
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:09,710
Yeah,
I had that sickness that everyone has 

2884
02:15:09,710 --> 02:15:12,681
that I think Jamie has now where it was 
like a upper respiratory bronchitis kind

2885
02:15:13,021 --> 02:15:16,050
of flu thing that.
But mine lasted like three weeks,

2886
02:15:16,051 --> 02:15:18,720
so I had it for a whole week.
I had it for a while.

2887
02:15:18,721 --> 02:15:21,440
It might've been more than a week.
It might've been two weeks because I had

2888
02:15:21,441 --> 02:15:26,441
it for.
I had it for awhile and then I worked 

2889
02:15:26,441 --> 02:15:26,520
out too hard and then a god had again.
I was like,

2890
02:15:26,530 --> 02:15:27,960
Whoa,
this super strong.

2891
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:29,840
I was like,
this is a deceptive cold.

2892
02:15:29,841 --> 02:15:32,070
Like it's taken a long time to kick.
Yeah,

2893
02:15:32,071 --> 02:15:37,071
my voice is still kind of fucked up.
I mean I just got done hacking up 

2894
02:15:37,071 --> 02:15:38,670
goobers for like a week.
It's not a good one.

2895
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:40,390
Yeah,
so for.

2896
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:45,710
For almost a month.
I haven't been to the gym since then 

2897
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:46,290
because I still don't like.
Maybe today I feel 100 percent,

2898
02:15:46,291 --> 02:15:48,960
but I still haven't been 100 percent for
awhile.

2899
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:49,950
That's the thing,
man.

2900
02:15:49,951 --> 02:15:51,620
When you start feeling Shitty,
it's.

2901
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:56,740
It's really important to give your body 
a break and let your body rehabilitate 

2902
02:15:56,740 --> 02:16:01,550
people.
They have this idea of sweating it out 

2903
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:02,700
maybe a little bit like a little 
exercise.

2904
02:16:02,701 --> 02:16:04,710
We'll get your blood pumping and 
there'll be.

2905
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:07,620
As long as you're not putting it under 
stress and strain,

2906
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:11,580
but when you start thinking you're going
to work your way out of a cold,

2907
02:16:11,581 --> 02:16:13,420
you just going to make your body sicker.
Yeah.

2908
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:16,170
I just been sleeping.
Just underestimated it.

2909
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,220
Whatever.
I thought it was just a minor cold.

2910
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:23,390
I'm like,
I'm just going to lift a little weights 

2911
02:16:23,390 --> 02:16:23,390
here.
But uh,

2912
02:16:23,390 --> 02:16:23,400
the next day I was like woo.
And it had a little bit of,

2913
02:16:23,730 --> 02:16:28,050
almost every symptom like it came back 
where I threw up like the flu,

2914
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:29,770
Zika,
the Zika virus.

2915
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:35,760
So don't get pregnant.
My little head baby dude.

2916
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:39,670
Like this poor little head babies are 
like,

2917
02:16:39,730 --> 02:16:41,860
oh,
the babies that get affected by it.

2918
02:16:41,861 --> 02:16:42,730
Oh,
how dare you.

2919
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:43,830
Not all of them that.
Well,

2920
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:49,380
I thought you were saying you were head.
I didn't know what you're talking about 

2921
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:52,081
the baby born to the Zika virus,
but are they going to be 100 percent 

2922
02:16:52,081 --> 02:16:52,081
brain functional?
Like,

2923
02:16:52,081 --> 02:16:52,400
I don't know.

2924
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:55,720
It's real dangerous apparently.
But you know,

2925
02:16:55,990 --> 02:16:58,240
I,
I don't know enough to really comment on

2926
02:16:58,241 --> 02:17:00,250
it.
I don't know how much of it is,

2927
02:17:00,251 --> 02:17:02,380
um,
medically proven fact.

2928
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:05,170
But I think when women get pregnant and 
they have it,

2929
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:08,080
it's very dangerous.
I think.

2930
02:17:08,081 --> 02:17:09,790
Um,
that's what people are scared of.

2931
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:13,540
I've heard people say they won't travel 
now because of the Zika virus.

2932
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:15,010
I have some friends that wouldn't go to 
Florida.

2933
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:16,000
She's,
they're pregnant.

2934
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:19,300
They didn't move to close and what not.
Hey Man.

2935
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:22,710
I mean if it's true,
I would feel the same way.

2936
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:25,690
Imagine how fucking guilty you would 
feel if you're like,

2937
02:17:25,691 --> 02:17:27,370
no,
fuck that I'm getting my party on.

2938
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:30,160
No,
I'm going to Miami Bitch.

2939
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:31,400
And you know,
like,

2940
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:33,840
just showing a little bit.
You're like,

2941
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:36,460
I don't give a fuck.
I'm hitting my last night.

2942
02:17:36,461 --> 02:17:41,461
Girl.
You'd feel so awful.

2943
02:17:42,670 --> 02:17:44,410
What?
A fucked up virus.

2944
02:17:44,470 --> 02:17:46,060
A virus.
It ruins the baby.

2945
02:17:46,130 --> 02:17:49,850
Now if she fucks a Hawaiian guy,
the head will be fine.

2946
02:17:49,851 --> 02:17:52,490
Right?
If she has the Zika virus,

2947
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:57,830
why in guy or,
or somebody gets into the,

2948
02:17:58,580 --> 02:18:03,220
into steroids.
Some with a larger head of Polynesia.

2949
02:18:03,310 --> 02:18:06,410
Polynesia.
Like some always what you need.

2950
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:08,750
You mean Samoan would've been a good 
example.

2951
02:18:08,751 --> 02:18:12,230
I don't know what the fuck you're 
talking about are normal sized people.

2952
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:14,200
Uh,
I guess you're right there.

2953
02:18:14,330 --> 02:18:16,550
I mean there's some big Hawaiians like 
the Rock,

2954
02:18:17,090 --> 02:18:18,500
you know?
Yeah.

2955
02:18:18,710 --> 02:18:19,720
But like,
um,

2956
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:21,640
samoans are giant.
Okay.

2957
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:23,580
So if it's a Mo and fucks,
some,

2958
02:18:23,690 --> 02:18:26,630
a woman with is like a virus,
will they have a normal size?

2959
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:28,580
That would be a normal.
I don't think it works that way.

2960
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:29,540
I would like to see.

2961
02:18:29,810 --> 02:18:33,030
I think someones just have better brain 
structure,

2962
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:38,270
jaw structure and like head structure.
They have a more sound frame to hold the

2963
02:18:38,521 --> 02:18:39,830
brain in.
But uh,

2964
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,610
I think the fucking brain shrinks.
Dude,

2965
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:44,040
I think it's some real issues.

2966
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:45,810
You just said the rocky made me think of
it.

2967
02:18:45,811 --> 02:18:50,811
You know,
he's making the Baywatch movie right 

2968
02:18:50,811 --> 02:18:50,811
now.
Yeah.

2969
02:18:50,811 --> 02:18:53,170
A ZAC Efron's in it with them.
Have you seen the pictures of Zac Efron 

2970
02:18:53,170 --> 02:18:54,930
going around right now?
We're talking about all of that happened

2971
02:18:54,931 --> 02:18:55,840
then.
But what about them?

2972
02:18:56,190 --> 02:18:57,840
Is that steroids,
do you think?

2973
02:18:58,140 --> 02:18:59,400
Yes.
One hundred percent.

2974
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:00,280
Can you get that?

2975
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:02,340
You can definitely get that big without 
steroids.

2976
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:04,140
Do you have a young guy?
But hold on a second.

2977
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:06,990
He's a young guy.
He's been lifting weights for years.

2978
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:09,900
He had a six pack just a couple of years
ago.

2979
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:10,690
Sure.
Um,

2980
02:19:11,130 --> 02:19:16,130
he was shredded and if you just steady 
straight lifted weights for a long time 

2981
02:19:17,310 --> 02:19:19,500
without doing anything.
Yes.

2982
02:19:19,890 --> 02:19:20,730
Like,
you know,

2983
02:19:20,731 --> 02:19:22,560
you've seen that video of me from that,
uh,

2984
02:19:22,590 --> 02:19:26,370
NBC from that um,
vh one fashion awards thing.

2985
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:27,860
The,
that was,

2986
02:19:27,870 --> 02:19:28,120
yeah,

2987
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:33,130
where I was naked and when I was in that
thing I barely lifted weights.

2988
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:38,800
I mean I,
I did like Chin ups and I did some 

2989
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:41,340
weightlifting.
Mostly it was just doing kickboxing and 

2990
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:43,070
I had never taken anything.
No testosterone,

2991
02:19:43,071 --> 02:19:44,750
no steroids,
no nothing.

2992
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:49,900
And I had quite a bit of muscle,
like there's certain people that are 

2993
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:54,161
more prone to being muscular,
especially if you've been doing 

2994
02:19:54,161 --> 02:19:57,140
gymnastics or something like that,
like really young in life or wrestling.

2995
02:19:57,141 --> 02:20:02,141
A lot of wrestlers get it.
But for me it was kickboxing and a lot 

2996
02:20:02,141 --> 02:20:05,660
of calisthenics and some weightlifting,
but not even that much.

2997
02:20:05,661 --> 02:20:06,500
Really.
Not like,

2998
02:20:06,501 --> 02:20:08,860
like a serious bodybuilder would be 
doing it if I,

2999
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:12,380
if I lifted once a week,
it was very,

3000
02:20:12,381 --> 02:20:16,490
it was very rare for me to stay steady.
I would lift like for a few months,

3001
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:21,491
then I would stop and I'd go back to at 
some point was I was dedicated way more 

3002
02:20:21,491 --> 02:20:23,960
to kick boxing that I was to anything 
else and I still put on a lot of muscle.

3003
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:29,090
I take that back.
I've seen Zac is always at the comedy 

3004
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:31,791
store and when he's wearing normal 
clothes he just doesn't look that 

3005
02:20:31,791 --> 02:20:35,001
muscular,
but I just looked back 2010 and he's 

3006
02:20:35,001 --> 02:20:36,030
been ripped since then.
So swimmer,

3007
02:20:36,090 --> 02:20:36,780
swimmer,
body.

3008
02:20:36,810 --> 02:20:38,160
Yeah,
but he's got a trainer.

3009
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:40,020
I'm sure if you've got a trainer,

3010
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:42,920
trainer makes you work hard,
you're going to get more muscle.

3011
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:48,310
It's like you get to a certain level,
like like if you see a guy like me who's

3012
02:20:48,651 --> 02:20:53,651
48 and you see that he's.
He still has a good amount of muscle and

3013
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:59,030
it looks thick most of the time.
That guy's taking testosterone,

3014
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:01,340
especially today.
Today's Day.

3015
02:21:01,341 --> 02:21:03,630
Like the benefits of it are just so 
obvious.

3016
02:21:03,631 --> 02:21:08,631
I mean you could not take it and just be
like a regular 60 year old guy and just 

3017
02:21:09,441 --> 02:21:12,740
feel frail or you see these guys who 
aren't taking it.

3018
02:21:12,741 --> 02:21:14,630
They're 60 years old that are fucking 
shredded,

3019
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:18,890
like you go to the beach,
go to like I'm fucking Maui or something

3020
02:21:18,891 --> 02:21:20,140
like that.
Go to the four seasons.

3021
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:25,180
You'll see some businessman.
I was like in his sixties with six pack 

3022
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:29,141
and giant traps,
some 60 year old guy with a personal 

3023
02:21:29,141 --> 02:21:29,860
trainers taking testosterone.
Like,

3024
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:31,940
um,
I think that would be way better than to

3025
02:21:31,941 --> 02:21:32,420
be like

3026
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:36,440
burt reynolds character look terrible.
There is 63.

3027
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:41,470
Wow.
That he's using placement of that 

3028
02:21:41,470 --> 02:21:43,900
floating device.
Hasselhoff was a very nice guy and he 

3029
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:44,570
was unfair factor.
So I will cease comment.

3030
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:49,840
However,
there is a gigantic difference between 

3031
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:53,070
the left and the man on the right.
The man on the left hand screen is the 

3032
02:21:53,070 --> 02:21:57,710
fucking rock and Holy Shit.
What a stud.

3033
02:21:57,711 --> 02:22:02,711
That guy is like,
look at the size of him and he's a huge 

3034
02:22:02,711 --> 02:22:04,820
guy on top of that.
So you know,

3035
02:22:04,821 --> 02:22:06,410
the rock is like six,
three,

3036
02:22:06,411 --> 02:22:07,580
something like that.
Right?

3037
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:08,900
Is He,
he's six three.

3038
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:13,010
That sounds about right.
Probably to 72 gigantic.

3039
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,940
I mean just shredded and dedicated.
Gets up every morning

3040
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:18,200
worn out.
But again,

3041
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:22,940
if I had to guess like the rock is a.
not that much younger than me.

3042
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:24,770
I'm 48.
What is that guy?

3043
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:27,330
Is he 44?
How old is he?

3044
02:22:28,170 --> 02:22:29,560
How it guest Brian Take.
Yes,

3045
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:30,750
hit the rock.
Yeah,

3046
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:35,780
I would say is if you're age 49,
43.

3047
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:38,760
Here we go.
But point being,

3048
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:43,230
I mean it's,
it's technically possible to be that big

3049
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:46,290
without steroids and he does have an 
insane work ethic,

3050
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:50,200
but I would imagine he's taking 
testosterone and it has to.

3051
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:55,680
There's no shame in it.
Everybody's people weird about like 

3052
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:58,820
hiding that it's these are chemical 
components of our body that we can 

3053
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:00,450
manipulate.
Not talking about taking massive amounts

3054
02:23:00,451 --> 02:23:02,550
of it because that's dangerous.
It's not smart.

3055
02:23:02,551 --> 02:23:04,160
It's not good for you.
It'll,

3056
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:07,890
it's gonna fuck you up.
Like when when guys go too deep with it,

3057
02:23:07,891 --> 02:23:08,730
it's going to fuck you up.

3058
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:13,470
But that doesn't mean that like low 
levels of it aren't possibly helpful.

3059
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:18,720
Take it.
Because the alternative is your body 

3060
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:18,720
just stops working.
Good.

3061
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,490
I mean that's the alternative.
I mean everybody wants.

3062
02:23:20,491 --> 02:23:22,410
It's like there's a pride thing involved
in it.

3063
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:24,900
Like where people don't want to admit 
they need it.

3064
02:23:24,901 --> 02:23:27,390
It's a real weird.
When do you think is the,

3065
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:29,360
or not the best,
but what's.

3066
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:31,680
What do you think is a good way to 
decide when you should take.

3067
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:34,050
Go to a doctor for sure.
One hundred percent.

3068
02:23:34,051 --> 02:23:39,051
Yeah,
you should go to a doctor who really 

3069
02:23:39,051 --> 02:23:41,391
understands what's going on,
where he's on top of the latest as far 

3070
02:23:41,391 --> 02:23:46,110
as replacing hormones and what are the 
benefits of doing it naturally,

3071
02:23:46,111 --> 02:23:51,111
where the benefits of augmenting it with
some sort of a synthetic hormone and 

3072
02:23:51,111 --> 02:23:52,140
have a guy who's kind of a long history 
of it,

3073
02:23:52,141 --> 02:23:57,141
who does blood work,
extensive blood work and wants to find 

3074
02:23:57,141 --> 02:23:58,110
out how healthy you are and the first 
thing they're going to do if he's good,

3075
02:23:58,410 --> 02:24:00,870
first thing they're going to do is 
manipulate your diet.

3076
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:03,720
That's the first thing they all do.
They all want to look at your blood work

3077
02:24:03,721 --> 02:24:04,170
and go,
look,

3078
02:24:04,171 --> 02:24:09,171
you're really low in d,
three this you that you needed to start 

3079
02:24:09,171 --> 02:24:10,470
taking Niacin,
like what kind of foods are you eating?

3080
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:15,710
Because you're just doing that.
Just lowering your sugar intake and all 

3081
02:24:16,021 --> 02:24:18,270
your bullshit that you didn't and 
alcohol.

3082
02:24:18,271 --> 02:24:23,271
Just that alone.
If you can minimize alcohol and lower 

3083
02:24:23,271 --> 02:24:23,271
your sugar and take like really lower 
it,

3084
02:24:23,271 --> 02:24:25,080
you'll have a big impact on your 
hormones.

3085
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:28,680
Just that it'll have a big impact on all
aspects of your body.

3086
02:24:28,681 --> 02:24:32,550
Your body will just work better.
Your insulin won't be so fucking spiked.

3087
02:24:32,551 --> 02:24:37,551
It just gets real weird when you start 
chugging mountain dew all day and you 

3088
02:24:37,551 --> 02:24:42,381
get like insane levels of sugar that a 
lot of people get and I know people are 

3089
02:24:42,381 --> 02:24:43,170
going to get all of this focus sugar 
joke.

3090
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:45,140
Talk about sugar too much.
I know,

3091
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:46,710
I know you're right,
but.

3092
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:50,100
But that's the part is they'll,
they'll work on your diet first.

3093
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:52,410
So what they would do is they would,
they would check your blood,

3094
02:24:52,590 --> 02:24:55,140
they'd find out where your levels are of
everything,

3095
02:24:55,141 --> 02:24:59,250
including your thyroid hormones.
A lot of people have thyroid issues.

3096
02:24:59,251 --> 02:25:01,890
It might not even know about it.
I put my shit's all fucked up.

3097
02:25:01,891 --> 02:25:06,891
I bet all ABC and d probably you should 
get it checked out and then you should 

3098
02:25:06,891 --> 02:25:06,891
totally do that.
You know,

3099
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:09,960
but if you're,
you have to be like willing to listen to

3100
02:25:09,961 --> 02:25:12,930
them.
If they say you have to drink water,

3101
02:25:12,931 --> 02:25:14,880
you have to take nice and you have to do
this,

3102
02:25:14,881 --> 02:25:18,900
you have to do that.
I want you to limit your amount of fried

3103
02:25:18,901 --> 02:25:20,430
foods,
trans fats,

3104
02:25:20,431 --> 02:25:22,350
which you find a good doctor that does 
this.

3105
02:25:22,351 --> 02:25:24,310
Besides like maybe just a question 
asker.

3106
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:25,900
Backpage.
Good question.

3107
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:30,960
You know,
it's funny because you don't want to 

3108
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:30,960
quack.
You know,

3109
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:33,361
you don't want some fucking nutty dude.
He just wants to shoot you up with 

3110
02:25:33,361 --> 02:25:33,361
steroids.
We want to.

3111
02:25:33,361 --> 02:25:37,810
You want to have a doctor that is 
intelligent about how they approach it 

3112
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:38,830
and hopefully a doctor that's older than
you,

3113
02:25:38,831 --> 02:25:42,010
that's on it.
That's like best case scenario.

3114
02:25:42,250 --> 02:25:44,650
If your doctor's not taking hormones,
hm,

3115
02:25:44,830 --> 02:25:48,360
but you're.
But you're add,

3116
02:25:48,390 --> 02:25:50,650
dude,
what are you doing trying to stay alive.

3117
02:25:51,130 --> 02:25:52,510
What are you doing?
You know,

3118
02:25:52,730 --> 02:25:56,350
be talked to some 80 year old doctor and
he's fucking yoked.

3119
02:25:58,990 --> 02:26:00,950
That's the guy you want to listen to.
I'll go,

3120
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:01,870
okay,
what's he doing?

3121
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:03,220
What we doing over there?
Dude,

3122
02:26:03,730 --> 02:26:08,690
why so strong?
There's some old dudes that are involved

3123
02:26:08,691 --> 02:26:11,450
in power lifting competitions.
It's bananas.

3124
02:26:12,410 --> 02:26:13,730
I mean,
I don't know if they're pretending to be

3125
02:26:13,731 --> 02:26:15,170
natural.
I don't know how that works.

3126
02:26:15,230 --> 02:26:16,430
Are they allowed to do whatever they 
want?

3127
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:18,050
But I was watching these,
um,

3128
02:26:18,530 --> 02:26:23,530
these guys are,
they're in their sixties and they're 

3129
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:25,300
power lifting.
I'm talking like massive amounts of 

3130
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:25,300
weight.
Five,

3131
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:25,590
600 pounds.
Watch guys,

3132
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:26,730
peril,
power lift.

3133
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:29,590
And I'm like,
what,

3134
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:32,320
how,
how old are these guys?

3135
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:36,740
And they're dead lifting 500 pounds,
600 pounds.

3136
02:26:36,741 --> 02:26:37,770
I'm like,
that's crazy.

3137
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:39,580
Like,
those people didn't exist.

3138
02:26:39,581 --> 02:26:43,180
There was no 60 year old dead lifters 20
years ago,

3139
02:26:43,470 --> 02:26:45,130
but they didn't even think about doing 
it.

3140
02:26:46,850 --> 02:26:48,560
Yeah,
there's a lot of those guys at my gym,

3141
02:26:48,610 --> 02:26:53,610
a lot of the old guys that you're like,
how is this guy still going to the 

3142
02:26:53,610 --> 02:26:57,020
academy?
And his body's crazy looking because 

3143
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:57,740
when you have an old body mixed with 
muscles,

3144
02:26:57,800 --> 02:26:59,690
it's really weird.
Well,

3145
02:27:00,170 --> 02:27:03,310
there's a big difference between a 
person who's not doing well.

3146
02:27:04,050 --> 02:27:07,790
How old is that guy?
The Arnold Classic Europe.

3147
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:12,940
Two thousand 12.
Over 60 posedown over 60 guys over 60.

3148
02:27:13,250 --> 02:27:14,780
That is.
Oh my God,

3149
02:27:15,260 --> 02:27:20,260
that looks like Cgi.
Doesn't that look fake since saying yes 

3150
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:21,350
with that guy's old man face.
Look at that.

3151
02:27:21,351 --> 02:27:23,420
That looks like it looks like Jay Leno 
or something.

3152
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:25,220
Especially as that.
We'll look at him.

3153
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:29,450
He's dancing terribly.
His skin is kind of wrinkly and he's got

3154
02:27:29,451 --> 02:27:31,550
a cop mustache.
Got It all going on.

3155
02:27:31,970 --> 02:27:33,890
It's got a big enough tub with these 
guys.

3156
02:27:34,430 --> 02:27:39,430
He's got the John Stossel over 60 
shredded fuck.

3157
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:45,070
See,
this is the difference between being a 

3158
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:47,051
man and being a woman too,
because I don't think that a woman 

3159
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:52,480
couldn't take some shit that will like 
give her like a more feminine body as 

3160
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:53,510
she gets older.
You know what I mean?

3161
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:57,410
Whereas the guy like these guys were 
obviously taken some shit and they're in

3162
02:27:57,411 --> 02:28:01,400
their sixties and they have all this 
muscle and they look like,

3163
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:04,340
like fucking super athletes.
I mean that's what these guys look like.

3164
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:09,880
It's ridiculous.
Guy Definitely looks.

3165
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:12,100
It definitely looks crazy.
Nah,

3166
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:17,150
didn't look right.
But that guy right there with the red 

3167
02:28:17,150 --> 02:28:17,420
shorts and the far left like that guy 
looks like he will be 30 years old.

3168
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:22,450
That's insane.
The fact that that guy is 60 something 

3169
02:28:22,450 --> 02:28:23,990
that's the same,
but my point being,

3170
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:26,780
there's not anything like this available
for a woman.

3171
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:30,950
A woman can't take something that like 
makes her as she gets older,

3172
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:33,860
look more like a younger woman.

3173
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:41,260
Why do they all have to be that color?
Does that make it look better or 

3174
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:41,260
something?
Yeah.

3175
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:45,100
The um,
they use that fake tanning shit because 

3176
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:47,831
the darker they are,
the more it highlights their 

3177
02:28:47,831 --> 02:28:47,831
muscularity.
That old guy has got a flabby ass.

3178
02:28:47,831 --> 02:28:52,210
He shouldn't turn his ass to the camera.
Shaved it down to this little cute 

3179
02:28:52,210 --> 02:28:53,690
Mohawk hipster.
Oh,

3180
02:28:53,691 --> 02:28:55,340
that's a.
Oh yeah,

3181
02:28:55,341 --> 02:29:00,341
I didn't even notice that.
So you had a 60 year old dude with a 

3182
02:29:00,341 --> 02:29:00,341
Mohawk?
Maybe at first it could be the original.

3183
02:29:00,341 --> 02:29:02,720
Maybe never let it go.
Just get giant ab muscles.

3184
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:03,650
This is getting gay

3185
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:06,680
faces tripping.

3186
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:08,990
Well,
let's wrap this up.

3187
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:12,200
Let's bring it home.
You got anything else you wanted to talk

3188
02:29:12,201 --> 02:29:14,750
about?
Can we shut this bitch off?

3189
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:17,780
Could shut this bitch.
Shut this bitch off and move on with our

3190
02:29:17,781 --> 02:29:18,860
lives.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3191
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:21,350
It's been beautiful.
Is episode seven,

3192
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:22,090
seven,
seven now,

3193
02:29:22,300 --> 02:29:24,700
so I thought it had to be you because of
all the,

3194
02:29:24,730 --> 02:29:28,100
your seven references that you threw in 
all throughout the years.

3195
02:29:28,250 --> 02:29:29,570
That number haunts me.
So bad.

3196
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:31,030
Why?
I don't know.

3197
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,830
It just comes up so much now.
Okay.

3198
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:36,200
Are sure I have a seven on my shirt to 
you.

3199
02:29:36,770 --> 02:29:37,510
Uh,
I dunno,

3200
02:29:37,550 --> 02:29:38,780
I might,
I don't give a fuck.

3201
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:39,800
