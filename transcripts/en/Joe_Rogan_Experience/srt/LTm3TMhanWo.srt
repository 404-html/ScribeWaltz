1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,920
When you see thousands of people that
are innocent that got killed by drones,

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,570
a million innocence killed in Iraq.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,400
If that's not a crime against humanity,

4
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:08,630
what is a crime against you?

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,473
Morning.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,660
Okay.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,290
A lot of shit comes up that
people would want to vote on,

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,090
like the bailouts,

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,380
the war.

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,090
I'll think things of this nature.

11
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,470
There's a lot of things
that people would like.

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,730
It's going to affect us.

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,020
We would like to vote on this,

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,180
but you don't get devoted.

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,170
You get to vote on a representative.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,880
These people are going to represent you.

17
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,910
Once they get into office and thinking
about some of the laws that are in place

18
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:36,110
to protect corporations,

19
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,530
think about some of the laws that are in
place that fuck people over every day.

20
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,461
They wouldn't be there.

21
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,450
People were voting for them.

22
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,160
We all have this,

23
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,710
this desire to have someone lead us.

24
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:47,491
We all have this,

25
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,490
this feeling where we need
someone who's smarter and wiser,

26
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,690
who represents us.

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,381
You know,

28
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,180
and when you really fucking dumb,

29
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,590
the problem is really dumb.

30
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,250
People,

31
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,540
they get a say in everything too,

32
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,350
and they're,

33
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,460
they're subject to a lot of tricks there
subjects to that they're subject to

34
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,330
nationalism.

35
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,990
They're subject to these
kind of ridiculous Rah Rah
Rah America speeches that

36
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:08,190
don't say Jack Shit.

37
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,030
They say nothing.

38
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,510
It's all just this cheerleading fucking
event and they they're subject to,

39
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,130
they can't help it.

40
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,800
They're dumb.

41
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,650
They don't know they're
being bullshitted dude.

42
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,270
They grew up around dumb people.

43
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,740
They go to work with don people.

44
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,590
There's no one in their family that's
interesting or ask any questions at all

45
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:23,400
and they just get stuck

46
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,941
right into it.

47
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:24,774
Man,

48
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,641
it's a,

49
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,020
society is so greedy.

50
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,700
We're willing to go to war.

51
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,070
We're willing to go places in [inaudible],

52
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
these big metal machines that kill people
and fuck people up just so we can make

53
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:38,544
more money.

54
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,560
And the way our society is set up,

55
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:40,831
I mean,

56
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,540
I've heard it argued and argued
successfully that our society runs on war.

57
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,321
You know,

58
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:50,580
it runs on the domination of the other
parts of the world and literally that's

59
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,470
the only way you can control
a gigantic chunk of the glove.

60
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,840
You have to keep everybody down.

61
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,591
You know,

62
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,630
and that's what our society is based on.

63
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,890
We can't be fighting over each other
because you know this guys are like a

64
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,760
million people die in Iraq.

65
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,181
And he goes,

66
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:03,361
Hey,

67
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,620
well I'm just doesn't happen over here.

68
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,010
But it is that is over here.

69
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:06,601
It's just over here,

70
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,434
over there.

71
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,041
It's the same thing.

72
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,980
And some people you don't know that
were born somewhere else who fucking got

73
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:11,814
jacked.

74
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,580
You get trapped in that
whole idea of you know,

75
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,780
this is my team,

76
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,460
these are my people and you know,

77
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:21,460
someone fucking plays a country music
song and throws up a flag and I'm in fuck

78
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:21,650
it.

79
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,483
It feels good.

80
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,850
It feels good to be in right,

81
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,871
feels good.

82
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:29,460
But God bless America feels good singing
around with a bunch of other people and

83
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,940
you're all drinking fucking baddest
motherfuckers on the planet.

84
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,600
Woo.

85
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,980
And that's how people get recruited.

86
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,100
It's a cluster fuck man.

87
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,630
These poor fucking kids,

88
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:41,990
man.

89
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,100
Do you imagine being 1819 being talked
into doing this shit for a bunch of

90
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:49,430
bloodthirsty motherfuckers who just are
trying to get whatever they're trying to

91
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,264
get over there.

92
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,320
Whatever the fuck it is,

93
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,000
whether it's a lithium,

94
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,140
you know,

95
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,810
minerals in the mountains that
they used to make cell phone,

96
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,850
whether it's 90% plus
the world's opium supply,

97
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,160
90 fucking percent.

98
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,090
That is a multibeam
multibillion dollar business.

99
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:11,470
And if you think these
fucking industrialists cock
suckers that are running the

100
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,760
world are going to leave that money
behind your fucking crazy dude.

101
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,270
They've got United States army
troops guarding poppy field.

102
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,600
There's fucking so much heroin there.

103
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,171
I mean,

104
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,010
it's incredible.

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,640
The fucking brother of the
president of Afghanistan,

106
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,610
his brother was selling heroin
and getting paid by the CIA.

107
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,000
I mean,

108
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
God dammit.

109
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,810
Heroin is absolutely addictive,

110
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,650
okay?

111
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,460
People who try heroin get
hooked on heroin is everywhere.

112
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,150
Okay,

113
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,260
so you need to sell it.

114
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,970
Someone selling who's selling it,

115
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,291
I don't know,

116
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,950
but 90% of it comes from this one place
where we have to be to save our freedom.

117
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,250
You can't criticize it
because if you criticize it,

118
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,360
you're a shithead.

119
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,510
You don't appreciate the troops
and what they're doing for you,

120
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:55,570
and that's not the case at all.

121
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
I just don't like the idea of these
fucking people leading us in any direction

122
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,340
where you need to sacrifice your life.

123
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,420
I don't believe it.

124
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
I don't believe them when there's
been so many fucking lies.

125
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,580
I mean the more you look it up,

126
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:13,570
the more they may go go into any of
the stories on the weapons of mass

127
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:17,290
destruction before we invaded and compare
them to what we actually know that

128
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,820
they really knew when they said that.

129
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,650
It's like they did it on purpose.

130
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:24,760
They wanted to get in there for whatever
fucking reason and if it's some crazy,

131
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,930
the world is going to end.

132
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,860
If we don't stop this,

133
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,680
but we can't tell you shit like
I would love to believe you.

134
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,860
I would love to believe that
the reason why you're a,

135
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:36,100
you're not telling us exactly what the
fuck is going on is because you're really

136
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:39,520
protecting us from some insanely
evil thing that if we knew about it,

137
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:39,820
it would,

138
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,140
society would collapse,

139
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,190
but our strong,

140
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:42,641
brave,

141
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:46,000
powerful leaders or gun to
guide us without our knowledge.

142
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,810
I would love to believe you if
you weren't all full of shit.

143
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,830
We're going to have to step back and
look at it all in a different way.

144
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,350
Dealing with all this nonsense that
we have with the two party system.

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,790
We're spinning our wheels.

146
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,990
We're not getting any traction.

147
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:08,660
This is all nonsense to
same nonsense with Obama.

148
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:11,570
If we dealt with with Bush
special interest groups,

149
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:15,860
controlling what people say and do and
what direction the country goes in and

150
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,810
save us from the bad guys,

151
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,190
shut the fuck up,

152
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:19,361
man.

153
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,540
It's the same nonsense.

154
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,751
Operation.

155
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:28,751
Northwoods was something that was plotted
out during the 1960s signed by the

156
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,200
Joint Chiefs of staff where they were
going to fake terrorist attacks that

157
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:37,640
American civilians and blame it on the
Cuban so we could go to war with Cuba and

158
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,120
involved a bunch of Shit
like blowing up a jetliner.

159
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,030
They were going to have a drone jetliner
blow it up and say that people died on

160
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:44,121
it.

161
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:46,880
And this was going to get everybody
fired up about going to war with Cuba.

162
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,950
They were even going to
tack won ton him obey.

163
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,390
They were going to arm Cuban friendlies
to attack Guantanamo Bay so that we

164
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,560
would have to go to war with Cuba.

165
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,670
I feel like the,

166
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,630
our own government,

167
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:57,650
they plotted out.

168
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:58,610
This is like real shit.

169
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,800
I remember when I,

170
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,430
I saw,

171
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,920
um,

172
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,730
JFK,

173
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,070
the Oliver Stone movie and that was like,

174
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,690
part of the premise that JFK,

175
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,130
that Oliver Stone was,

176
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:07,880
um,

177
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,090
was pushing in this film is that they
kill JFK because they want to stay in

178
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,280
Vietnam because they were making
a lot of money into Vietnam.

179
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,410
And I remember at the time
seen that movie going,

180
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,360
that is absolutely ridiculous.

181
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:21,770
Who the fuck believes that I going to
start wars and keep wars going just so

182
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,980
that they can make money even though
it's not a real war on a just war.

183
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,150
Nobody wants to go to a ward.

184
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,710
That stupid hippie bullshit.

185
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,401
Well,

186
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,680
as I got older and I started
investigating history,

187
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,140
you know from way back to Vietnam to
the Gulf of Tonkin to all the shit that

188
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:39,110
happened when the Kennedy and Nixon were
an office to all the shit that happened

189
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,710
with Reagan and the contras in Nicaragua
and that sends an Easter and all the

190
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,010
difference,

191
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,820
various things that have happened in
human history where it's clear that the

192
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:47,860
United States is,

193
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,410
you know,

194
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,250
we're fucking around with all kinds of
things all the time to make money and

195
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,740
that there's a bunch of people
that are profiting off of war.

196
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,800
And then there were doctors profiting
like a little bit of money here and there.

197
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,011
You'll,

198
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:58,221
you know,

199
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,890
you look at like what's going
on with like how much money,

200
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,060
how a and made for the war.

201
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,100
We're talking about billions
and billions of dollars.

202
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,060
That's like real money.

203
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,010
Eisenhower leaving office and he's giving
a speech warning the American people

204
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:15,920
about the power of the
military industrial complex.

205
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,600
You know when you watch that you like,

206
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:17,811
well,

207
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:22,250
here is a sitting president who's leaving
office and what was the most important

208
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,510
thing that he wants to tell people is
that you have to be careful because there

209
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,890
is a machine here that wants to go to war.

210
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,430
There's a business behind going to other
countries and fucking people up and

211
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:34,460
taking their shit,

212
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,560
and they come up with reasons to do this
and they sacrifice American lives to do

213
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,600
this and they do it for profit.

214
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,850
And it sounds absolutely ridiculous.

215
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,940
It sounds absolutely outrageous that
the greatest country on earth could be

216
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:49,160
involved in something
like that from the get go,

217
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,320
but yet that's what history says.

218
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,450
That's how it points the
points in that direction.

219
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,280
It points to that direction
that it's going in

220
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,700
and the councils of government,

221
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,260
we must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence,

222
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,000
whether sought an orange zone by
the military industrial complex.

223
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,940
The potential for the disastrous rise
of misplaced power exists and will

224
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:12,774
persist.

225
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,110
We must never let the weight
of this combination in danger,

226
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:18,450
our liberties or democratic processes.

227
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,283
Yeah.

228
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,453
Okay.

229
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,120
Tower seven disturbs me the most.

230
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,140
That tower seven just went just
like a controlled demolition

231
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,341
and everybody's like,

232
00:08:59,341 --> 00:08:59,551
yeah,

233
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,800
but it had holes in the building and
you see the hole in the building.

234
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,401
Yes,

235
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,540
I see the hole in the building,

236
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,940
but wouldn't it fall towards that whole,

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,440
why is it falling like that?

238
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,480
That doesn't make sense to me.

239
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,314
With tower seven

240
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,410
the way tower seven foul,

241
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:18,411
it just kinked in the middle and
fell down three false bead almost.

242
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,560
I mean everybody liked they'll,

243
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,430
they'll nitpick at you.

244
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:20,621
Oh,

245
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:22,410
it was one 10th of a second
slower than free fall.

246
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,510
Even if it was just close to free fall.

247
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,231
That's crazy.

248
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,340
There was no resistance.

249
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:30,990
It just gave up why we did life wiggle
and collapse towards where Jack got

250
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:31,531
jacked.

251
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:31,860
It does.

252
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,370
It just seems like a controlled
demolition that that bothers me.
