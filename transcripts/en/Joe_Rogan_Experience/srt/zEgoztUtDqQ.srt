1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,750
Try My day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,330
People get crazy.
You know people get crazy.

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:06,940
Look,
look,

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,310
Brian is,
people go crazy too.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,110
Everybody gets crazy.
People get crazy.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,460
Like why did Rhonda charge after?
Why did she try to stand with,

7
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,220
with holly like that and charge after
it.

8
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:18,600
That's not the right attempt.
Right?

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,920
Like you,
she did a page.

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,350
What page was also at that VIP party and
Paige and I have spoken with were

11
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,850
friendly,
don't know her that well,

12
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,230
but anyway,
she felt the need.

13
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,320
She came out to Schick.
Nisha,

14
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,213
Nisha.
She's like,

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,220
I have to tell you this experience I had
with Rhonda.

16
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,780
And I'm like,
what?

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,471
And she's like,
well,

18
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:37,830
we were at a reebok deal just recently.
And she,

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,870
she's like,
we were at a shoot and she's like,

20
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,340
I was trying to find her so we could get
a picture.

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,250
And the Reebok people were like,
don't ask Rhonda for a picture.

22
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,630
And she's like,
why?

23
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,430
She's like,
just don't do,

24
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:50,160
just stay away from Rhonda.
Don't ask her for a picture.

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,720
She's like,
okay.

26
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,721
And I guess Ronda came later that day
and like seek trout and w there's like

27
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,800
cussed her out.
Like they've never really had a

28
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,700
conversation either.
She's like,

29
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,840
I don't know Rhonda,
like,

30
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,610
you know,
other than hi bye.

31
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,600
That's it.
And like,

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,460
I guess she came up,
Rodney came up,

33
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,930
I was like,
fuck you,

34
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:10,200
you fair weather bitch.
How dare you cross me,

35
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:10,711
Blah Blah,
blah.

36
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,670
She's like,
cross you,

37
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,560
what are you talking about?
And she was like,

38
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,310
you congratulated Holly Holm for beating
me,

39
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,390
so fuck you.
You fucking fairweather 115 pounds.

40
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:23,880
Like it was just like,
went off on page and page gave me,

41
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,571
told me,
and I was like,

42
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,710
honey,
welcome to my world.

43
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,541
She's like,
oh my gosh.

44
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,580
He's like,
I'm glad that I saw this side of her,

45
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,780
so I know,
you know,

46
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,614
I'm like,
well,

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,791
and she's like,
you know,

48
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,750
cause I didn't understand.
She's like,

49
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,441
I told her honor,
like,

50
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:37,470
I'm sorry if that offended you,
but you don't allowed to congratulate

51
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,440
whoever I want.
And um,

52
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,280
she's like,
because I congratulated Rosen,

53
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:43,530
I'm a eunice.
When she beat me.

54
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,040
I was like,
you know,

55
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,210
congratulations you what my ass.
That was a badass performance and she's

56
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:48,481
like,
you know,

57
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:51,750
I just simply told holly,
congratulations once again like it

58
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,640
wasn't anything,
you know anti Rhonda,

59
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,910
but Rhonda is just ripped her a new one.
Wow.

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,830
Do you have to be on team Rhonda for
life?

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,010
Yeah,
I guess I've never been on t Rhonda.

62
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,873
I'm good.

63
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,980
All or none because we have to assume
she's evolved.

64
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,810
Right,
but that's the best I think I've seen

65
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:12,840
her look so I have to assume like she's
going to be better than that even.

66
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,270
Do you have goals as far as like what
you want to do with the title?

67
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,460
Who,
how long do you want to hold it?

68
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:25,461
Do you have any thoughts in mind of like
must be opponents like is getting Rhonda

69
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,180
back in the Octagon?
Yeah,

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
that's important.
I need that.

71
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,210
Like that has to happen.
That's a very important to me and I have

72
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,640
Amanda had to me,
I do not want to look pastor because

73
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,280
they think that would be a huge mistake.
It's not one that I want to make as a

74
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,380
veteran in my career.
That would be a rookie move.

75
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,641
Um,
but you know,

76
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:43,200
in the back of my mind,
of course,

77
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:47,790
like the fight with Ronda is something I
want to happen and you don't know when

78
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,300
it will happen.

79
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,330
It could be anticipated for November.
I've heard that be tossed around in the

80
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,430
UFC that you,
she's planning on coming back and maybe

81
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,620
it might be Madison Square Garden.
That would be great.

82
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,410
I want to focus on that.
I want to focus on Amanda,

83
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,430
but I know in the back of my mind and I
want,

84
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,040
I want that fight.
Like I want that to happen.

85
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:07,810
I think it's so important to me in my
career to go and beat Ronda and prove

86
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,150
everyone else.
Like I've been an underdog in most of my

87
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,220
fights.
I've been the person that people have

88
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,310
always counted out in my entire career,
my entire life.

89
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,890
Most people are telling me,
you can't,

90
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,090
you couldn't,
you shouldn't,

91
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,010
you wouldn't.
And I'm,

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,671
you know,
that's,

93
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,650
I'm fine with that.
I'm perfectly fine with that.

94
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,010
I am at the best point in my career and
Rhonda is at the worst.

95
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,350
You know,
she's going through what I've already

96
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:34,150
been through time and time again and I
have built myself back up from that

97
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,620
point,
time and time again.

98
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,110
I know that I can do that.
I'm confident in that.

99
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,380
Here I am standing the strongest that
I've ever stood and I've already been

100
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,600
through that.
I've already been head kicked and

101
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,400
knocked out.
That happened to me before.

102
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,340
Like I picked myself up,
but pull myself up by my bootstraps,

103
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,770
but one for back in front of the other
and worked.

104
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,830
Got My strike first world title,
I lost that you're on to pick myself

105
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,380
back up.
But one funder for the other got back on

106
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,430
the horse.
Fought,

107
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,120
fought,
fought,

108
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,730
fought Ronda again.
The EOC was devastated,

109
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:03,550
crushed,
thought my world was just falling down

110
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,970
around me,
coming to an end cap.

111
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,910
Pekka put one foot in front,
the other gal back on the horse.

112
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,470
And now here I am,
the world champion.

113
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,570
You know,
I know that I'm tough.

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,180
I know that I have what it takes to beat
Ronda.

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,850
Many people don't believe that that's
okay.

116
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,980
I've been in this position before.
Many be,

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,510
most people didn't think I was going to
be holly.

118
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,670
He most people didn't think he was gonna
beat Ronda.

119
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,560
It doesn't matter to me what other
people think.

120
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,810
It matters what I believe and what I
know.

121
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,020
And um,
the question mark is what,

122
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,940
how is Rhonda going to come back from
this?

123
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,280
I know what I've been hearing from
Rhonda in the media and the press.

124
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,390
Um,
she's been a little quiet lately,

125
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:45,280
but before that it wasn't what I would
have expected to hear from someone who

126
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:47,110
really wants to come back and who's
really,

127
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,770
really a fighter at the core.
She's a great athlete.

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,670
She's a great fighter.

129
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,340
She's accomplished a lot of things,
credit where credit's due,

130
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,080
you know,
I give her a round of applause for

131
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,340
everything she's been able to
accomplish.

132
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,900
I'll tell you what,
every time I've ever lost in my career,

133
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,950
I went bananas to get back in their
ballistic.

134
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,810
I was like,
I have to like right now,

135
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,340
just like holly was like,
they're like,

136
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,660
when do you want to fight again?
She's like tomorrow against Meesha.

137
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,120
Now that's what you want to hear.
When someone has a devastating loss,

138
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,240
they want to get back in there right now
and face that person right now or,

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,370
or someone else,
just get that loss of the record.

140
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,890
Erase it.
When I lost the cat Zingano,

141
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,830
I freaked out.
I freaked out.

142
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:31,120
I called Sean Shelby and I was like,
get me another fight right now.

143
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,230
He's like,
your nose isn't even heal.

144
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,400
I don't give a fuck.

145
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,770
I wanna I wanna fight.
I want it now.

146
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:39,790
I want to know when it's coming up like
right now or I'm going to freak out.

147
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,070
I don't know what to tell you,
but I'm going to lose my shit if I don't

148
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,960
have like a fight on the horizon,
lose it.

149
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,640
And then I hear Rhonda like,
Oh,

150
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,730
I'm going to take a year off and I'm
going to,

151
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,140
you know,
I'm going to do this.

152
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,830
I'm gonna.
I'm like,

153
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,460
that just doesn't sound like someone who
really wants this anymore.

154
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,560
And I think that fight might've broker
that could be wrong,

155
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,890
but I think something inside of her is
different than it was before.

156
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,260
Um,
maybe she's not broken,

157
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,440
but it's different because how much do
you think of factor

158
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,330
is,
how much of a factor do you think

159
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:12,780
success is in the park in terms of she's
doing movies.

160
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
She's,
she was,

161
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:15,690
uh,
the darling of all these late night

162
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:18,160
television shows and everybody wanted to
hang out with her.

163
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:21,480
Is doing these commercials with,
you know,

164
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,050
seth rogen on television.
Like how much of a factor is that?

165
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,080
Well,
she asked the curity,

166
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,240
now she has job security outside the
FCC.

167
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:32,390
She doesn't really need that anymore.
And I think maybe that's also something

168
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,760
on her mind is like,
does she really want this?

169
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,100
Because winning is awesome.
It's great.

170
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,870
It's easy.
It's like when you win,

171
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,790
everybody loves you.
Everybody supports you.

172
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,710
Everybody's there.
Everybody's on your train.

173
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,720
When you lose fucking sucks.
It sucks.

174
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,480
And only the people that really love
your still really,

175
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,640
really there for you.
Everyone else was just like,

176
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,181
yeah,
whatever.

177
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,980
That's loser.
And then you have the social media,

178
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,080
you know,
white nights that come out and want to

179
00:06:57,081 --> 00:07:00,680
tell you what a piece of shit you are
and how you're never going to accomplish

180
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:01,970
anything and you'll never win another
fight.

181
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:02,990
And you might as well just quit and
retire,

182
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,860
blah,
blah.

183
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,120
See those people and you have to make a
choice,

184
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:08,360
you know?

185
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,540
And,
and my choice has always been the,

186
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,480
to do,
to,

187
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:13,550
to,
to keep fighting,

188
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,730
you know,
and it,

189
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,790
and it just don't,
I don't recognize,

190
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,490
there's a lot of things I recognize in
Ronda that I can,

191
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,800
I can recognize her greatness.
I can recognize,

192
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,030
you know,
her championship.

193
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:27,890
I can recognize things I don't identify
with that I don't identify with sitting

194
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,320
on that loss for a year.
I cannot understand it.

195
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:33,710
If it was me,
it would have eaten me alive inside and

196
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,430
out.
Tend to,

197
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,620
I couldn't have done it.
I couldn't be making a movie.

198
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,421
I couldn't be doing that.
I would,

199
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:38,254
it would just,

200
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,000
but did she,
I don't think she has a choice.

201
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,970
I think if you have movie contracts,
I think you have to fulfill them.

202
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,510
Do you,
I dunno,

203
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,930
it is conor have to show up for showing
up or press conferences is one thing,

204
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,910
but I don't think,
I think she could've,

205
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,170
she could've fought because they said
they had anticipated for her to come

206
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:01,250
back at UFC 200.
They wanted that and they,

207
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,300
and,
and Dana said she could have,

208
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,000
but should she,
she could have,

209
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:06,700
but should she,

210
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,840
well,
I think that could have and should,

211
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:10,090
she was because she had to do a movie
for three months.

212
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,470
So like doing the movie for three months
would have taken three months outside of

213
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:15,400
our camp.
And you've done a movie before,

214
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:17,290
you know what it's like you're on the
set all day,

215
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,750
16 hour days.
It's long and grueling.

216
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:20,710
You don't have time to train.

217
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,560
Yeah.
But after a loss like that,

218
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,490
I think you really have to have enough
time to actually focus in then on top of

219
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:31,100
that to getting,
getting flatlined like that.

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,480
Like you have to have,
uh,

221
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,970
some time to recover.
You recover your head.

222
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,040
Yeah,
absolutely.

223
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,730
I just don't know if a year that would,
I'm just saying that would crush me.

224
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,770
I wouldn't be able to do what she's
doing right now.

225
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,580
I wouldn't physically be able to like to
deal with that for your and,

226
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,160
and if I had to think of it,
eat me alive,

227
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,700
like I think I'd be so depressed.
And so I'm pretty sure it's eating her

228
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:54,910
alive too.
But how do you sit on it for a year

229
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,580
then?
How do you do that?

230
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,950
Do what you gotta do?
I can't,

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,950
I couldn't,
well,

232
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,240
you know,
it's all speculation.

233
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,430
We only,
we don't know until she comes back.

234
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,230
But the other thing too is like,
you know,

235
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,130
she's like,
you know,

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,330
she had her,
you know,

237
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,061
her downs,
her,

238
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,090
her really,
really low,

239
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,340
which I empathize with.
I've been there,

240
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,421
um,
you know,

241
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,190
but then she said,
you know,

242
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,540
I was thinking about,
you know,

243
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,030
these all these negative thoughts and,
and um,

244
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,370
then I looked up on the island and she
said this on my own show.

245
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,680
I looked up and I saw Travis Brown and I
realized,

246
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:23,910
you know,
I've got to stick around to have his

247
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,100
babies.
And I thought like what?

248
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,300
What went through my mind is like,
I gotta get back and get my title back.

249
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,890
I gotta to get back and like win a
fight.

250
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,560
Like it.
It just seemed like her mindset is

251
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:37,080
different than what I would expect a
fighter's mindset to be.

252
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,630
Does that make sense at all?
Like what?

253
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,910
I'm trying,
what I'm saying it's like it didn't seem

254
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:46,740
like her motivation was to to fight and
win again.

255
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,300
It was,
there was other things,

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,660
and I'm not saying she's not going to
come back and be great or come back and

257
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,580
fight.
I'm not questioning that.

258
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:57,810
I'm questioning where her true
motivation is coming from because I

259
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,870
think while she was winning,
it was so awesome.

260
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,890
Like she's like,
well yeah,

261
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm want to keep doing this.

262
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,190
Of course I'm going to keep a keep them
crushing girls.

263
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,810
I'm demolishing them.
I'm the star.

264
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:09,090
All these great things are coming now.
She already has that.

265
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,150
She's already making movies.
She already has millions of millions of

266
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,460
dollars.
Is Her true motivation?

267
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,600
Was it just,
you know,

268
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,600
keeping that undefeated streak because
she talked about that so much.

269
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,020
You know,
I will retire undefeated w and then she,

270
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,520
she even said like,
I don't,

271
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,890
you know,
I'm questioning what am I doing now?

272
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:26,640
Like,
you know,

273
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,440
now I'm not going to ever retire
undefeated.

274
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,930
So what is my,
you know,

275
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,310
maybe I'm meant for this.
Maybe I meant she doesn't really know

276
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,430
that was her identity.
It was like to be undefeated in this

277
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,264
sport.
So if,

278
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,990
if that's not the goal anymore,
I just don't know.

279
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:44,280
Like I feel like I sent something off,
I sent something is not right in her

280
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:47,040
mindset and I think she's going to come
back and I think she's going to fight

281
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,280
anything.

282
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,280
She'll fight hard,
but I just don't know if she still has

283
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,640
it after a brutal loss like that,
you know,

284
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,270
if she's still hungry enough,
those are fighting words.

285
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,520
Yeah.
Is She hungry?

286
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:02,660
Not,
that's the question.

287
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
What you're doing right now is you're,
you're throwing up the bat signal,

288
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,430
right?
Yeah.

289
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,190
Well,
that's how I feel.

290
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,630
A lot of shit because people were like,
oh,

291
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,520
you know what,
don't,

292
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't,
I don't apologize for anything that I

293
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:16,550
say unless I really say it's something
that was,

294
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,000
that I didn't mean to say that was
hurtful to someone and I'm like,

295
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,843
oh,
I fucked up.

296
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,590
But honestly,
if it's my opinion is my opinion,

297
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:23,200
if you don't like it,
I'm not,

298
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,660
I'm not gonna apologize for my opinion.
You're going to apologize for anything

299
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:27,261
that I,
you know,

300
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,320
that had to say about the way I feel
about Rhonda,

301
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,520
the way I feel about any,
any of these situations,

302
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:31,760
you know?

303
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,750
So I've just,
I'm,

304
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,170
I'm going to be as transparent as an
end.

305
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,890
I don't think you're saying anything
disrespectful either.

306
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:39,920
And I don't think,
I think as a champion,

307
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:41,570
and that's what you are,
you,

308
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,830
you're analyzing someone's mindset and
you're totally entitled to that.

309
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,020
Yeah.
And I have a lot of respect for Rhonda

310
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,550
as an athlete.
You know,

311
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,590
a lot like,
I just think you'll ever be friends

312
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,890
after it's all said and done.
Never.

313
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,310
I don't think so.
No.

314
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,120
No.
I think she thinks that I've done so

315
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,490
many things and like I don't think she
would ever,

316
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,250
I think she blames me for things that I
didn't even do.

317
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,151
So,
I mean,

318
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,570
how do you even get around that?
Right.

319
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,750
You know,
like I heard what you guys did your

320
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,150
interview,
she said something like,

321
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,080
then I called a promotion and like tried
to get crispy.

322
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,770
Oh,
like,

323
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,420
um,
mess with him before,

324
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:17,800
like his fight or something that,
that,

325
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,020
that I guess he,
I guess he was contracted to another

326
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:24,130
promotion and he wasn't supposed to be
while he was on the ultimate fighter.

327
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,180
And I guess that that Dana received a
call and then they thought that I,

328
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,390
she thought that I did that.
I'm like,

329
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:33,430
first of,
first of all,

330
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,010
like I didn't even know he signed to
another organization at all.

331
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,090
And if you,
you know,

332
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,560
like if he was,
it didn't even,

333
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,390
wouldn't have even crossed my mind.
Like I'm too,

334
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,460
like you said,
I'm too easy going to even think of

335
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,670
something like that.
And I'm not malicious by any means.

336
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:49,630
I've nothing against Krispy [inaudible],
but I think she thought that I tried to

337
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:53,380
like mess with him.
Like I called the promoter of whatever

338
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,720
organization,
little small contract.

339
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,520
Don't even know how I would have known
that.

340
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,580
How would you even know that?
How do you know?

341
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,890
But this is the same girl that ripped
page for,

342
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,790
for congratulating holly.
Like she has her way of thinking and

343
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,910
she's going to hate me until the day she
dies and I'm okay with that.

344
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,360
That's fine.
We don't need to be friends.

345
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,370
That's okay.
You know?

346
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm perfectly fine with that.
Yeah.

347
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,800
[inaudible].
