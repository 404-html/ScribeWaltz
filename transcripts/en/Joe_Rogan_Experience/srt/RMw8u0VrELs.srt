1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,630
Okay.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,160
And four, three, two,

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,450
boom. And we're live pat of the
university of bad ass or eight.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,550
I'm more like the, uh, I'm more like
the vice president, the president,

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,290
probably a CJ or TCC.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,370
He's the president of the University of
bad ass three Maria cohost and have a

7
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,950
little podcast. We do, dude, I
fucking love your Instagram page.

8
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,580
If there's new stuff that I'm going to
call when the shit hits the fan might be

9
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,730
you woo, rock and roll, baby
on there for your brother.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,780
I also like guys who are my age or older
that still get after it and the gym and

11
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:44,320
you're fucking page is filled with you
getting after it, bro. We could go on,

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,760
we could full of a full segment.
I'm that alone. And the secret,

13
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:53,410
the big secret behind it, which there's
not much of a secret as you know.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,820
I mean, it isn't hard after hard work
sucks and not everybody's cut out for it.

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,790
Yeah. People just don't enjoy it.
Yep. They tried to find a lot of,

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,900
a lot of Nice excuses why
they don't get after it. And

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,820
one of the big excuses his age. Yeah. Um,

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,850
I run into guys all the time
during my full time training,

19
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:19,630
Gig Ram training guys on the
range who say, uh, you know,

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,930
38 or 40, or whatever, and I'm
getting old. I'm like, Bro,

21
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,300
let me tell you something.
This is,

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,750
this is something somebody told me
when I was 30 and I've got affirmation,

23
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,670
uh, uh, of this from guys like you who
have stayed fit their entire lives.

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,140
The fittest of a man's
age is around like 44, 45.

25
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:45,810
That's when you can be on the top of your
game and ultra runners. Yeah. You know,

26
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,130
the strongest, the fastest,
the fittest, the smartest,

27
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:51,551
you know,

28
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:56,050
when it comes to knowing your body and
how much you can do and how much you

29
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:58,780
could take after that,

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,130
then you got to start being a lot
smaller, you know, die how you work out,

31
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:07,630
how often, you know, like,
I'm, I'm super tentative now,

32
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:09,980
not to overwork. Yeah. Me Too. Um,

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,710
because I've been told there
is no such thing as overworked,

34
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,270
but there is a such thing
as under recovery. Um, I,

35
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,650
I err on the side of caution a lot. Yeah.
A lot more now. And I've got it down, man.

36
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,670
I, I, I started, uh, this
system combat strength training

37
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,650
when I retired from the military because
when I retired from the military,

38
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,900
I retired before reconstructive surgeries,

39
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,770
13 broken bones and any ground
pounder who's, you know,

40
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,790
special ops guy who did 20 plus years,
there's a lot of freaking mile,

41
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,470
which on that combat chassis, right?
You know, he's, he's jacked up.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,270
What'd you get reconstructed?
Uh, the first one was,

43
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,700
uh, this bicep. I was a toad jumper.
It doesn't have to make sense. Uh,

44
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,590
what does it mean? Oh, it's
related to static line jumping,

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,080
uh, where you pass a static
line off to a jump master.

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,920
He secures it and the static line,
uh,

47
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,660
at the end of the static line deploys
your parachute. So it's like, you know,

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,260
it's like rookie jumping. It's, it's
real infantry base jumping. Well,

49
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,210
that static line got wrapped around my
reserve and around my arm and pulled me

50
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:23,290
with the plane and it pulled my
bicep into my form, broke ribs,

51
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:27,370
dislocated shoulder concussion.
And this is when I was fucking 18 years,

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,530
I'd just do it and I already
got jacked up. Uh, next one was,

53
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:36,960
um,
a diskectomy l five s one just come,

54
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,180
just a kind of an amalgamation of Hilo
crashes and vehicle crashes and stuff

55
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,224
like that.

56
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,950
People don't know what that means.
It means your disks,

57
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:50,820
they trim a little piece of it so it
doesn't go against your nerve. Yeah.

58
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,070
And it was,
it was a massive herniation,

59
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,940
so they were able to take the big chunk
out and then do that trim up as well,

60
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,790
which is,
that's an easy surgery.

61
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,980
Ever had really knee
reconstruction socked. I mean,

62
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:07,800
I was a full freaking year,
six months of, you know,

63
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,740
getting back on your feet. And then, uh,

64
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,170
another year before I
was like 100% and I was,

65
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,590
I think I was still in my twenties.

66
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,370
Did you get a ACL reconstruction?

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,170
Sasse senator Patella Tendon. Yeah, I did
that one. It's hard. That's a hard one.

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,100
I did the other one with the allograft
or cadaver. It's Wazier really?

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,740
So it's six months, six months, and
I was a hundred percent man. Yeah,

70
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:37,030
cause I've heard it's difference.
Yup. Damn, that's a big
chunk of time. Six months.

71
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,020
Yeah.
It's,

72
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,100
but the other thing is that sometimes
people's bodies reject those allografts

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,990
didn't have with me,
I got lucky,

74
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,030
but I do know of some people and also it
feels like it's healed before it really

75
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,010
healed. Oh, do you know how that works?

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,150
The Wa what happens is they take that
graft and they put it in there and then

77
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:57,580
instead of that being your new ligament,

78
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,200
your body has to replace
that with tissue. Uh, right.

79
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,270
So your body has to re proliferate that
tendon with its own cells and so it

80
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:10,510
takes a long time so it feels stable and
you're like, oh my knees back man, my,

81
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,470
my legs feel strong.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,740
And then you go to pivot to throw a
punch or something like that. Pop, pop.

83
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,820
It just pops like a wet
piece of toilet paper. Yeah.

84
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,113
Yeah.

85
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,230
You know some people they say some people
are ACL to pain and others are not.

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,110
But man,
I need that one down too,

87
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,270
Jack.

88
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,990
I don't understand people not being ACL
depending on to stabilize and ligament

89
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:30,824
in your knee.

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,320
And then the last one was oh,
show up shoulder.

91
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,510
And they were able to do that. Not
that basically, you know, scope it,

92
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,200
they were able to scope it and like
four different places and they created,

93
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,150
let me see if I get this right.

94
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:50,151
They created a bigger injury
to promote more healing.

95
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,410
Jesus. Yeah. So they did like bone
scrapes and stuff like that and when,

96
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:59,360
and so they were able to do it.
Cutting the shoulder open. Oh,

97
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,030
what was wrong with your shoulder?
Um, bunch of tears. It was, uh, uh,

98
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,800
how did I hurt that one?
That was,

99
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:11,540
I got called in one day and uh,
I used to drive my dirt bike to work,

100
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,360
uh,
like eight miles of a real pristine

101
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,050
forest and a t bone.

102
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,790
The deer go up 10 55 and it's
like hitting a brick house.

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,470
I mean, I'm sure you stop. Yeah.
There is no give with that thing.

104
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,170
And thankfully have good,
I've been a riding schools,

105
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,970
like even the Gary sending motorcross
school. So I was up high, elbows up high.

106
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:44,090
So I flew like superman. I didn't
get all tied up, good bike,

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,100
but I mean I sailed for 2020 yards.

108
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,040
So Jesus Christ in the air,
60 feet and yeah,

109
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,970
yeah, yeah. Oh,

110
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,970
came down and hit directly flat
and then slid and hit a tree.

111
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,740
So I knew the shoulder was jacked up,

112
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:06,560
but that one I had all kinds
of neat injuries from that one.

113
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:10,550
Like I had this one thing
called a um, adhesion. So

114
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,700
I went, uh, I was able to make it to
work and they checked out my shoulder.

115
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,910
He said, yeah, you're jacked up. We'll
put you would get you Mri tomorrow.

116
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:23,570
Humma humma that night I go home and,
um,

117
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,960
I wake up to go take a piss and,
uh,

118
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,300
I realize I've got this massive like
bubble on my side, massive. And I thought,

119
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,420
man, I'm going to have internal bleeding.
Just think it was gigantic. It was,

120
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,810
we're right on top of my pelvis.
So I guess I uh,

121
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,880
set my alarm clock for like every 10
minutes just to see if it's still still

122
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,890
still with it and then went into the
next day and they sucked out a couple

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,001
thousand milliliters.

124
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:55,001
A bloody biproduct cause it was
the skin separating from the bone.

125
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,210
So I think that's what
they call it an adhesion.

126
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,980
So bunch of blood fills the
gap. Yeah, it was all orange.

127
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,230
Biproduct crap.
I've had some weird,

128
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,330
I'm sure injuries but,
but your piece back together I can tell,

129
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,430
you know you do a lot of crazy working
out with like I seen a lot of shit you do

130
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:20,150
with like cinder blocks make do
with what's around you. Well that,

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,440
so my work templates pretty,

132
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,120
it's off the charts.

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,260
Last year and the year before I traveled
to a different state every week and

134
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:35,120
most of them were Jetson. So lugging
all my shit to the airport every week,

135
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,990
all my guns and everything. This is for
tactical training, right? So it was this,

136
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,900
is this for private individuals
you military training?

137
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:46,820
Like how is all of the all new? Most,
most of my courses are open enrollment,

138
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,910
so I have all walks of life.
I mean,

139
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:52,460
the demographic is extremely wide.

140
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,040
And so as a skillset
disparity or guys who come,

141
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,750
you know how to 14 guys who
sign up for would be cops,

142
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,170
three military, the rest civilians.
And in that civilian group,

143
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,540
I mean they're from, you know, you got
computer programmers, you've got surgeons,

144
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:14,460
you've got lawyers, you've
got uh, uh, you know,

145
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,160
a strip club owners.
And I mean,

146
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,660
the demographic is pretty eclectic.
It's pretty wide.

147
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,150
And when I go to these places and stuff,

148
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,070
I used to like go to a la
fitness or something, you know,

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,940
like an la fitness after work.
But I got tired of that, you know,

150
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:37,140
just walking through trying to
navigate my way through endless maze.

151
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:40,590
A bench presses watching guys do
concentration curls in the, in the mirror.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,960
So I started range work outs
where a planet during the
day and it became a thing

153
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:50,400
where like fit guys in the class are
watching me and they're going, hey bro,

154
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:55,260
what's the workout after after training?
So can we do with you on your Instagram?

155
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah. But then the guys in
the course, we'll say, hey,

156
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:03,170
can I do the workout with you after,
after training? Yeah, yeah, Yup.

157
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,390
So you just find whatever's laying
around tire, cinder block. Yup.

158
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,520
Anything Dre, you know, if I have
a wall, I could do a lot with that.

159
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,100
Let's say it's five,
six foot wall.

160
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,360
There's a lot you could do with that
lot you could do with just the tree. Um,

161
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,820
some cinder blocks, you know. Uh,

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,270
and then every once in a while guys
will bring like a 90 pound sandbag or a

163
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:29,150
couple of kettle bells because now it's a
thing, right? Expect it sort of like, hi,

164
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,480
we want to do a pat Mac workout
after range day. And uh, you know,

165
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,480
Kudos to those guys because
that shit that's hard. You know,

166
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:40,410
when you're on the range all day
working your ass off and especially in a

167
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:45,411
blazing hot sun and guys hang out to
do a workout with me like bad Kudos.

168
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,170
See you bro.
Well,

169
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,560
one of the cool things about the internet
is that people find other people that

170
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:56,310
want to push themselves and they find
inspiration through guys like you and

171
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:56,790
there's,
you know,

172
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,500
dozens of guys like you online that
are like fun to follow and you get,

173
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,540
you go, this guy's doing it. I got to
fucking get off my ass and go do it.

174
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,720
Because sometimes people
just need an example.

175
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,560
They need someone to look at and go
there and it literally can change the way

176
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:13,890
you live your life. No doubt.
See a guy who's doing what
you're doing. You're like,

177
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,470
God dammit, he's fucking intense
all the time. He's getting after it.

178
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,680
Beard. Like lucky over here,
there's a cinderblock. I love that.

179
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,670
That's an Eagle Lake, Texas.
Probably three years ago.

180
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,420
What's the smoke? Is that exhaust
fume or gunshot? No, the the owner.

181
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,450
I know what that he was, he was
smoking. Um, it was a smoker. Oh,

182
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,960
that he was making meat. Oh Nice.
Yup, Yup. Yeah. But those are, that's,

183
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:44,590
those are hard workouts, man. Those swings
in between the legs like that. That's,

184
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,060
that's how you build the, the real core
strength. If you're back and you know,

185
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:52,990
your, your whole, that, the whole
spinal column, keep it tight and

186
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,790
you know, it's, it's, it's funny you get,

187
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,800
even today I read the, I'm reading
some comments about whatever it is.

188
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,800
There's a lot of stupid people out there
when it comes to like not understanding

189
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,200
the right way to work out, right. And
I want to tell these guys, hey man,

190
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,830
two things. One is if you do, if
you do what you've always done,

191
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,990
you're going to get what you've
always gotten. Number two,

192
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,720
I didn't go home last night and smoke
a bunch of crack and dream of shut up.

193
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,180
I mean, there's not, I've, I've done a
lot of freaking research, a lot of, um,

194
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,970
there's a lot of time and effort
that's gone into this and um,

195
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,660
they'll say, hey man, you're going to
throw your back out and doing that stuff.

196
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120
No mother fucker. That's, that's
building your back. You know,

197
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,900
work in that transverse plane is what
guys and neglect a lot. See here,

198
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,830
here we go. I'm going to get on this
freaking soap box. I swear to God, God,

199
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,670
go get on the bum. Do a box where
most guys, when most guys work out,

200
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,940
they live in what I call a Sagitta
listic environment. You know,

201
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,520
three planes of motion,
frontal saggital transverse.

202
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,860
So they're in this sagittal world doing
bench press and, and concentration curls.

203
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,120
Um,
out of the three planes of motion,

204
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,860
I would say that transverse most
important. Additionally, when we work out,

205
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,890
I would also argue with confidence that
it's the plane of emotion that is most

206
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,600
neglected.
That transverse plane.

207
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,010
I like to tell guys that
in the transverse plane,

208
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,200
lives lifesaving an ass kicking.

209
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,880
There are four reasons why we should,
why we should exercise.

210
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,860
This is Max opinion. Okay? One,
self preservation, longevity,

211
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,180
good for your health. Stronger,
longer. Motion is lotion.

212
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,610
Number two, the ability to save your own
life. Having that confidence. No one. Yup.

213
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,600
I could pull myself out of that burning
coal or over that wall, whatever.

214
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,560
Number three,
more importantly to me is being Batman.

215
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,980
The ability to save somebody else's life.
So there's three reasons.

216
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,080
The last one kicking somebody fucking ass.

217
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,120
So when I look at workout, I
look at those four things, right?

218
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:07,480
They're not like cosmetics or anything.

219
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,770
Cosmetics is a cool byproduct. Do you work
out right? You're going to look better.

220
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,280
You look better, you feel better, you're
more confident, you're more confident,

221
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:18,550
you performed better cause confidence,
performance work hand in hand. Sure.

222
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,860
So I mean there's no
freaking magic elixir to it.

223
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:27,430
You know it and it's,
and it's hard.

224
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,290
Yeah. People like to see, there
was like, if you do bench press,

225
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,560
you see a chest puff up and they see
those results. I always tell people,

226
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:36,560
if there's one exercise I would recommend,
like people who do Jujitsu,

227
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,360
Turkish getup. So the least romance
is the least romantic of all workouts.

228
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,570
Nobody wants to do those goddamn things.
Go to go to a gym.

229
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,550
You could go to a hundred
gyms if you're lucky.

230
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:50,690
You find one person doing Turkish getup.
Yup. Every gym we'll have someone,

231
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,040
someone somewhere is doing

232
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,910
bench press and someone's doing curls
and lat pull down machine and all that

233
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,450
normal shit. Yeah. Working
out. It's kind of there.

234
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,890
It's, it's like an anachronism, you know,

235
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:08,120
they're working in a world like
a muscle and fitness world still,

236
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,190
and that's fine working in isolation.
If that's your job.

237
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,650
There's three people who,
three types of people who should work.

238
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:19,370
How it concentration, like doing
uh, a curl or some, you know,

239
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,040
a concentration curls, a
professional bodybuilder, right?

240
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,340
That's your job man at your sport.
Number two,

241
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,540
you recovering from surgery and atrophy.
So it's physical therapy. Number three,

242
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,150
you had no fucking idea what
you're doing or you're a model.

243
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,210
You're trying to look sexy as fuck.
You know what I'm saying?

244
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,380
It's possible too. That's
right. Yeah. Right.

245
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,040
So they fall in that same category
trying to look prettier. Yup. Yup.

246
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,570
It's,

247
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,270
it's just not what you really need to
actually with exercise is something that's

248
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,910
going to mimic what you would actually
do in real life. Picking up things,

249
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:57,770
moving them around like farmer walks.
Yup. Pharma Walk, very unglamorous. Yup.

250
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Carry a heavy ass kettle bell in one hand
and just walk around for like a half a

251
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,170
mile and who you're fucking forum would
be dying. Your legs will be killing you,

252
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,810
your core is going to be shaking.
It's amazing.

253
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,840
And I liked the way you put it to
carry on once you know, Lowe's,

254
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,770
that one sided she got to do,

255
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,770
people don't know that they
tried to do with two arms,

256
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:18,050
but with two arms it bounces out.

257
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,210
And then it's really just
a grip and a leg exercise,

258
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:23,810
a little bit of lats and traps.
But really what you want to do is one,

259
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,350
100 pounder on one hand,
carry that bitch.

260
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,170
Everything is just kind of balance it out
and then turn around and put it on the

261
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:38,060
left hand. Yeah, it's great.
We do. Um, and my gym,

262
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,320
a lot of that where we load
one side of the time. Uh,

263
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,470
one of the things I love to
hear is a guy will say, man,

264
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,700
I'd never see you doing the same thing.
Yeah. I'm like, well, I pretty much don't.

265
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,820
Um, because I don't want to
fall into a Rut of complacent
adaptation, you know? Um,

266
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,040
so even guys to say, do you, uh,

267
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,340
do you do like Oly Lifts?
See, yeah, of course.

268
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,380
Every once in a while I'll
probably do a dead lift,

269
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,350
a standard deadlift once every two months,

270
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,360
but I'm doing variations of that. Like a
shovel dead lift or a suitcase, you know,

271
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:16,020
dead lifts that suck and are like you
said, are not glamorous. Yeah. Um,

272
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,090
I'll throw those in a bunch.
But do you do much cardio?

273
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,400
Here's how I knock out cardio is uh,
I have uh,

274
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,590
a formula with this. I have a program,

275
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,520
combat strength train.

276
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,930
I got an ebook and website and
all of this and your programs,

277
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:39,020
something that people could sign up for.
Oh yeah, yeah, they can buy the ebook. Um,

278
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,100
what's the website for? Jamie could pull
it up. Combat Strength training.com.

279
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,723
And I'm,

280
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
the formula is work in work in anaerobic
chunks and circuit to near metabolic

281
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:56,190
threshold to meet in a robot goal
and then like 30, 35 minutes.

282
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,470
So that does include warmup, you know,
so you good. Whatever it is. For me,

283
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,720
it's like bag work or
something for warm up,

284
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,810
just to make sure everything's
Loosey Goosey. The older you are,

285
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:10,740
the more you have to warm up,
man. Damn. Don't Jack yourself up.

286
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:14,080
It's called fit and is not brokeness.
Oh

287
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,553
yeah.
People.

288
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,980
That's another thing that people don't
like to do because it's not glamorous and

289
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:22,790
because the people get lazy, they
don't want to do that workout with it.

290
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,410
The preworkout, they don't want to
do all the skipping rope and all.

291
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:30,170
They'll just switch and stances and
jumping jacks and all that stuff.

292
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:34,070
But you really need to break a sweat
of real sweat before you actually start

293
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,160
lifting weights. And then even if
you lift weights or do anything,

294
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:40,610
like say if you're going
to do kettlebells, I'll
start off with 35 pounds.

295
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:43,970
I'll do everything nice and light at
first. I don't start off heavy. Nope.

296
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:49,110
Yup. Well that's, um, that's also wisdom.

297
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,730
Yes. You know, that's,

298
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,010
that's fucked up a bunch of times
telling us and yanking that. Yeah.

299
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,050
Chalk that one up to wisdom because uh,
um, you, you learn that, Eh, you know,

300
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:04,140
it's okay to put my big fat ego
aside. Yeah. I still have an ego,

301
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:08,520
but I'm not going to get jacked up
because I want to smoke these guys.

302
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,130
And in order to do that,
I can't be,

303
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,460
I can't have tweaks in my
neck and my back and yeah,

304
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,550
does a,
there's a bunch of guys who do these,

305
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,200
they do these workout competitions
called train to hunt and uh,

306
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,300
it's mostly for bow hunters.
Would they have all these um, uh,

307
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,550
physical challenges?

308
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:33,300
Like you'd do a bunch of stuff with
sandbags and the idea is that Jack your

309
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:36,360
heart rate up and then when
you have to execute a shot,

310
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,870
you gotta be in enough physical condition
so that you can bring your heart rate

311
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:44,730
down pretty rapidly and it's all timed
and they're competing. I love that stuff.

312
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:47,160
Yeah.
Do that kind of stuff with tactical.

313
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,830
Yeah. I've got a whole, an entire youtube
channel dedicated to that stuff. Nice.

314
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:55,610
So, um, uh, yeah,

315
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,920
they're all very, very
tough like shots, rifle,

316
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:05,030
pistol. And prior to that I'm pushing a
truck pulling at climbing a fast robe,

317
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,460
running with a sandbag. You know, it's
like, I call it shot impossible almost.

318
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:14,000
You know where that heart rate is slamming
and your throat and now you've got to

319
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,200
go into respiratory
pause and take these 50,

320
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,800
50 yard pistol shots. You know, I'm
doing pistol at 50 yards and Ding, ding,

321
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,140
Ding. Um, but yeah, I love that stuff.

322
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,160
And that's where interval training
really comes into play. You know,

323
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,330
learning that to control the heart rate
or learning how to breathe the right way.

324
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,080
Man, that shit, that shit is bad
ass. How big fan of all that.

325
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,580
Yeah, I am too. I've never
done a tactical course. Oh,

326
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:43,530
I really want to take some lessons though.

327
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,980
Like I saw Keanu Reeves doing it for John
Wick and I was like that looks fun. I

328
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,130
mean I've shot my guns at the
range before and stuff like that.

329
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:56,131
I've hunted with rifles but with pistols
I would like to go to some sort of law.

330
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,730
You'd love my courses.
Um,

331
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,740
cause I keep them as this one
of your things right here. Yeah,

332
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,060
that's a dude that's on the
roof, man. That's a lot of rope.

333
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:12,061
That's a hundred feet of
fat ass hemp rope with uh,

334
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,300
two 70 pound CNBS at the end of it.

335
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,270
And I forget what I do here,
but uh, there's the, yeah,

336
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:26,170
I got my steel at the end. I
forget. I think I run up. Oh
yeah, there's three cones.

337
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:30,400
I see him now so that the forums and
everything are just smoked jacked. Yeah,

338
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:35,060
they're there. Yeah. Plus Ma music
that'll get us kicked off youtube if we,

339
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,940
oh, this was a, yeah, this was a turn and
burn here. Just a simple turn of burden.

340
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,130
But that rope crushed my spirit.

341
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,050
There's a couple of these youtube
videos that I've got one Wareham.

342
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,730
I fell in love with the idea.
I thought,

343
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,970
cause I do this at the gym where I grab
a kettle bell and a balance it on end,

344
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,820
you know, see your balance down, right
upside down. It's so 55 pound Kettlebell.

345
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,400
Most people can't do that.

346
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,460
He would just bounce a kettlebell while
walk on a balance beam with them and

347
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,920
stuff like that. Phenomenal.
Yeah, it's good stuff.

348
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,010
So I thought, all right,
next youtube video,

349
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm going to do the 55 pound capital
balances thing on an shoot strong hand and

350
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:24,620
then balancing and shoot
support hand 50 yards, 50 yards.

351
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,940
So I got out of the race on a balance.
Yeah, it's on Youtube. Yeah. Uh,

352
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,970
so I got out there and I
got all my stuff ready,

353
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,270
got my bed of my truck,
got my gun laid out.

354
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,850
I throw that Kettlebell up lefthand first
and pull the pistol up and I'm looking

355
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:47,690
at the target and I am shaking like
a dog shit and sand spurs. I'm going,

356
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,680
this was a bad idea.
Oh my God.

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,250
And um, she had a clean shot to clean the
first time and then I have to, cause I,

358
00:22:56,251 --> 00:23:00,880
I do this like a West Stroud
type of filming, you know,

359
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:05,030
West drought, the uh, survival
Manson Les Les Stroud. Yeah.

360
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,680
So where I go and talk
to the camera afterwards,

361
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,190
I was so happy when it
rang again when it rang.

362
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,950
So I had this massive smile on my face.
I dropped the kettle bell,

363
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:18,100
I had to erase it and come over
to the camera and go. All right,

364
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:21,910
well that was a pretty good
time. You know, here's the time

365
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,071
upside down.

366
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:27,610
Kettlebells are great for shoulder
stability cause it's all like that.

367
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:32,600
Wigley once again, something that
people don't work on in the gym.

368
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:36,070
Stabilization and bounced,
stabilization, proprioception,

369
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:38,080
kinesthetic awareness cause it,

370
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:43,000
cause it ain't sexy and they're not
building peaks on biceps and you know,

371
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,370
cutting their abs.
Uh,

372
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,500
so we do a lot of like rubber band
work, holding isometric, you know,

373
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,870
and watch everything.
Freaking shake. Just saying

374
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,930
when you put together these drills and
you put together these programs, do you,

375
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:03,440
do you just sit down and map it all out
in your head? Do you think like, okay,

376
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:08,340
how am I going to emulate the kind of
stress in a like a life or death gunfight?

377
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,670
Your,
your heart rate jacked.

378
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,510
You might have to physically do something
meant to run from someone or climb

379
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:16,430
over something.
Is that how you do?

380
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,730
Yeah. How do you create, yeah,

381
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:21,300
you're talking about like the youtube
stuff where I do the physical thing with

382
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:25,140
the shoe. Yeah. The first thing I do is I,

383
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,360
I put it on my calendar just so I know
that I'm going to make one and then I'll

384
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:34,110
start thinking about it. What haven't
I done? Cause I have to think also,

385
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,330
uh,
I have to think about the audience,

386
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,430
the audience that follows me on youtube.
A lot of our gun guys. So they want,

387
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,820
they want to know about the gun that
I'm using. I have to think about that.

388
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,010
And then I have to think,
all right,

389
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,910
what challenge can cause I
want guys to replicate it.

390
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,370
I want them to like put those
little notes on the Uta.

391
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,640
I did this and my time was a
minute and 30, or whatever it was.

392
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:06,190
So I want them to be able to
replicate them as well. And, um,

393
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,640
Juan make them,
uh,

394
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,490
rear w with some real world
application in mind, you know,

395
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:18,030
so front loading the sandbag or uh,
getting in,

396
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,780
pulling something in and out of a car
and doing that with a happy bunch of

397
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:27,000
reputations. You know, you, when you're
doing dead weight in and out of a car,

398
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,840
you know, 150 pounds pulling
it in, pushing it out,

399
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,400
pulling it back in and pushing it out.

400
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,650
That'll smoke every freaking ounce of
your being and it'll crush your spirits.

401
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,420
Crazy. Right? A full grown woman,

402
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,670
you'll be able to pick her up
and put her in a car. Easy.

403
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,130
No hard tried getting her out.

404
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,460
Right. Especially if there's no, you know,
you, you got gotta think dead weight.

405
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,540
You know what? This person
is incapacitated. They ain't
helping you. Those arms,

406
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,383
those,
you know,

407
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:00,110
those limbs are moving everywhere
and it is a pain in the Dick.

408
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah. You're way better off with
150 pound barbell. Oh yeah. Yeah.

409
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,610
What else? Yeah. It's like, all right,
you shoulder, pull it out. Yeah.

410
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,090
So, but I, I kept to keep
those things in mind.

411
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,680
The other thing I want to do is
I want to make him a kind of,

412
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:22,970
want to make them hard enough so
not everybody could do it. Uh,

413
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,830
because I wanted to do
something that mind,

414
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,000
like industry competitors are not
doing. And I've, I've turned this,

415
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,130
I've, I've, uh,

416
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,160
started a kind of a fad I bought 10 years
ago were more guys are doing this now

417
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,330
they're putting like shoots
up on in a webs, you know,

418
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:46,200
with some physical activity
prior to or during a witch. Yeah.

419
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:50,640
Good. But uh, yeah, I'm
pretty sure I uh, you know,

420
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,310
I, uh, I made it cool. Yeah.

421
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,930
Well the more people doing it, the better.
Right? The more competition, the better.

422
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,190
Yup. Yeah. It's, it's just such a
smart thing to think of if you're,

423
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:05,730
if you really want to train the way you
train and really want to think about,

424
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:09,880
you know, like tactical situations
and real world application. I mean,

425
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:13,410
it's such a great way to go about doing
it and as he looks exciting and fun.

426
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:15,420
I mean, I haven't done
it, but I'm sure it's fun.

427
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,880
It's good. I talk a lot during my w now
during my courses, I don't do this stuff,

428
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,510
you know, I'm not cause I have,
I'll have 60 year old women in it.

429
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,950
I'll have a guys with Parkinson's,
even man come to my course.

430
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:31,650
I have guys and wheel chairs.
Yeah. I think guys, how do you,

431
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,220
how do you stabilize a guy when
they have Parkinson's? That's good.

432
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,820
That's what I showed this guy a trick.
What was his name?

433
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:40,350
See if I could remember his name.
It doesn't matter,

434
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,100
but he was 77 years old
and uh, he said, well,

435
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,880
I could either come to your course and
train or lay on my couch and die or

436
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,680
something. You know, it was to that effect
because he likes to shoot. I said, bro,

437
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,533
anytime,

438
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,530
but I have to modify the course to him
now because he can't even lay prone to

439
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,930
zero. Right, right, right.

440
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,860
So I would sit him on a
cooler and then I used a,

441
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:08,070
you know, furring strips all or they
hold up a target. They're just two,

442
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,470
one by twos, you know, about
five foot long. I had him,

443
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,820
Kris Cross those and hold them.

444
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,330
And then V to v Notch and it put his
rifle and that Vena cause he could sit up

445
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:23,100
pretty good with,
he couldn't get into prone,

446
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:27,780
he can't stand shoot
but sitting pretty good.

447
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,240
And you know when, uh,

448
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,030
when guys like that are concentrating
more, you see that shake go away too.

449
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,850
That's something we do at my gym too.
We trained Parkinson's,

450
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,960
a tata box Parkinson patients.
Really it's a, it's a,

451
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:46,230
it's a national program
called rock steady boxing.

452
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,450
They come in three times a week.
Where's your gym?

453
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,130
North Carolina. What's it called? So
people could go there. Spartek spot, uh,

454
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,060
s p a r like smaller. And then
TC, is it open to, yeah, it's,

455
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,910
yeah, it's open. Um, it, uh, it's,

456
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,780
it's very flight centric.
It's an MMA gym.

457
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,040
So everything we do is very
like fight centric with the,

458
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,630
with the physical work and
the lifting and all of that.

459
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,500
Uh, and then we have, uh,
programs like there's, we've got,

460
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:26,010
we got some really good fighters,
man, dude, coach there. I mean,

461
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:29,250
they were like legit.
Um,

462
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,690
so we got really good
fighters who do, uh, you know,

463
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,660
one on one coaching,
um,

464
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,700
everything from Greco to Bjj to,
uh,

465
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,640
tie to kickboxing to
standard boxing. Uh, it's,

466
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:49,720
it's an, it's a neat place. It's, it's
small. It's warehouse. It's very spartan,

467
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,120
you know, it's not sexy at all. Perfect.
Yeah, it's my favorite kind of freaking,

468
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,860
it's bad ass. And so what do you
do with these Parkinson's people?

469
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,450
So the rock steady boxing, uh,
folks, they have a program,

470
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,490
they come in a couple times a week
and they put them through a series of

471
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,020
exercises. You know, a lot of
it's just walking a straight line,

472
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,470
uh, holding this in Wa,
you know, loading one side.

473
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,540
And then once they're all warmed
up, um, they all kit up, man,

474
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,630
you see these guys were wrapping
and everything. You know, they,

475
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,900
they're so excited to get there
and they put the wraps on and uh,

476
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,610
and then they have is they
work a series of bad drills,

477
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,860
you know, a one, two lateral
move to next bag is, uh,

478
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,610
hooks, you know, left and right hooks, and
there's an upper cut bag. And there's a,

479
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,970
you know, the double end bag
and granted they're not moving,

480
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,081
they're not moving much,

481
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:48,580
but they're moving and they get
there and they love coming there. Uh,

482
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,970
and uh, some of them work up a
sweat. You know, it's, it's pretty,

483
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:55,780
it's pretty amazing seeing them get
off their asses and get to the gym.

484
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,613
And I look,

485
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,650
I remember you put something out and
I pinged you like a year ago. Oh,

486
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,140
it was a on a podcast and you were,
uh,

487
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:09,910
you were getting pretty emotional about
somebody not wanting to, uh, work out.

488
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,650
And I pinged you and I said,

489
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,600
I think I've mentioned that we got fucking
Parkinson's people coming to my gym.

490
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,750
You know,
it's just when people make those excuses,

491
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,690
that just drives me crazy
because I've seen examples of,

492
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:24,870
I've been very fortunate
that I have good health. Yep.

493
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,210
But I've seen many examples and
I've also been very fortunate.

494
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:30,670
I never got out of shape.
I just kept working on my whole life.

495
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,170
But I've seen people that are fat as fuck.
350 pounds just barely can get,

496
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,640
get a w all round.

497
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,220
And then they decide I'm going to take
control of my fucking health and then it

498
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:41,330
gets just do it.
Yeah.

499
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:44,530
They just do it and even if you just got
to walk around the block you need for

500
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:48,220
walk up flights of stairs.
Even if you just do a pushup.

501
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,480
Even if you do us it up, just do
something man. Do some body weight squats,

502
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:55,640
do something. It can be done. Yup. It,

503
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,000
you know the journey of a thousand
miles starts with a single step and,

504
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,340
and I'll have guys

505
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,860
in my community who were saying, who
will say, yeah man, I follow your stuff.

506
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:08,350
I'm sure a lot of shape and I
don't have the time to snatch,

507
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,510
which is another excuse does things.

508
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,470
I don't have the time to
get up an hour early. Right.

509
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,860
You have all the time in the world.
You had an hour of workout.

510
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,580
I'll fuck you up in an hour. Right.
You come work out with me for one hour.

511
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,720
I will have you crying
by the end of an hour.

512
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,710
That's plenty of time from warm up to
cool down one hour. Yep. Done. Yup.

513
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,900
That's a hundred percent yeah. If
you're, if you're, oh man. Oh Man.

514
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,750
There's my friend and my own
need more than that. Keith Weber,

515
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:39,190
and he has this extreme
kettle bell cardio. A DVD.

516
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,100
Yeah.
It's

517
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,230
available as a digital download though.
The,

518
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,640
I can't even do 40 minutes of this
motherfucker's workout with one 45 pound

519
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:51,410
kettle bell. 40 minutes in, my legs
are shaking, my arms are shaking.

520
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,570
I'm walking like,

521
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,840
like I blew both my fucking ankles
out for the next couple of days.

522
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,190
It's a ruthless,

523
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,210
you can get a lot done in
40 minutes and there he is.

524
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,020
He's a savage right on. Yeah. Yeah.
That guy's not sure I did it all.

525
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,670
He does crazy shit too. He,
uh, brings a kettle ball.

526
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,960
It's all on the beach.

527
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,400
He just brings a pair of kettlebells on
the beach and just fucking gets after it.

528
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:20,060
And you just follow along with them.
It's a great workout too, because you're,

529
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,620
you're doing what he's
doing, so, you know,

530
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:24,950
it's possible he's doing it right
in front of your face, right.

531
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,900
Yeah. You know, when it comes to,

532
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,160
I'll tell guys I'm coming to my gym once,

533
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,380
just once because all I need to do is bait
the hook. Yeah. Okay. You feeling good?

534
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:41,130
Yeah. Yeah. And, and I, and
they said, well, I'm afraid
you're going to smoke. I said,

535
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:46,080
nope. Because I run a, uh, whether
it's shooting or physical stuff,

536
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:50,250
I run a called performance based
trainee. Good. You know, I got this.

537
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,000
It's recognizes that we
all perform differently
performance as measured by doing

538
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:57,610
what we can with what we have. So, um,

539
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,070
it gives them permission to work within
their capability level, not mine.

540
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,380
So you don't need to
replicate what I'm doing, Bro.

541
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,040
We're going to do the same movements,
but I'm going to,

542
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:12,100
I'm going to scale this to you,
to your needs, you know, and, and,

543
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,210
and the other thing is I don't
want you to be incapacitated.

544
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,910
I don't want you to work out so hard that,

545
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,480
that you're not able to move
for the next three days. Right.

546
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:25,140
I have another rule is that you could
work out as hard as you want and the gym.

547
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,420
But when you walk out
that door that says exit,

548
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:30,320
you gotta be ready to kick someone's ass.
I mean,

549
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,930
I don't like to work out to the
point of being incapacitated. Right.

550
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,400
So there's a balancing act there and
I've figured it out. Fuck that up.

551
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:40,990
Many times. Many. Yeah, no. Yeah.

552
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,350
And I think that's why I figured it out
because too many times I am for a whole

553
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:51,240
weekend going, oh my God. Yeah.
My freaking ass, my thighs,

554
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:55,190
my you do for recovery. Do you a fuck
around with cryotherapy or sauna?

555
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,810
Nothing. Do nothing really?
No. I, nope. Nothing. Uh,

556
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,700
how come I,
I dunno.

557
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,640
I cause I haven't really needed it.

558
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,700
You just get a song in your
gym. Yup. Just that alone.

559
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,220
Get a sauna and a fucking
ice bath. Yeah. I drink,

560
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,890
I drink beer for recovery.
That's,

561
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,910
that's a nightly ritual.

562
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,470
I will not be able to function if I don't
how many beers I'll usually write for,

563
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,190
but they're like good quality pints,
you know?

564
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:34,140
I'm not like Chug your login,
Nascar soda by the case.

565
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,620
Barley pops like good quality a IPA,

566
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,140
stouts, porters or that kind of thing.
You just live for it. Yeah. Love it.

567
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,610
I'm a hobbyist man, right?
Amma hobbies that are bourbon.

568
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,670
So I, I, that doesn't seem to go
hand in hand. A lot of people's eyes.

569
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,850
I know with hardware, like you freaking
kidding me. It's like, hey man,

570
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,470
I have a policy. My wife having an, I have
a policy every night is Saturday night,

571
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,530
but every morning is Monday
morning. Wow, man. I like it. Yeah.

572
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,550
So we'd go out almost every night we
go out just because if I'm at home,

573
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,270
I'm going to work.
I'm going to work until I fall asleep.

574
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,740
So, you know, that clock hits six,
seven at night. I'm like, all right,

575
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,380
let me go meet my wife.
She's getting off of work.

576
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,080
We're going to go have a couple of pints,

577
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:28,890
have a big old bourbon or
something like that. And, uh, Yep.

578
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,890
I smoke cigars. Um, dip. Uh,

579
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,760
how did they keep, the thing is,
well, that's what I'm going to die.

580
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,770
It's all about diet.
I mean,

581
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:44,810
my Diet's ridiculous and it's
predominantly when I meal prep,

582
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:50,280
um, it's Collard Greens, Spinach,
bell pepper and chicken and that's it.

583
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,840
And then spice it up with, you know,
salt, pepper and prep for the week.

584
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,220
You make like a bunch,
but it doesn't,

585
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,140
I don't have a pot big enough to prep
for the week. So I prep for like two,

586
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:06,000
three days at a whack and just chow down.
And that's the other thing,

587
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:10,830
diet man, you know, there's this,
what's due to, puts a secret in diet.

588
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,090
Eat Food in food doesn't
come in a bag or a box.

589
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:18,450
That's a product shop at the
periphery of the grocery store.

590
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,620
If you go into the guts, all you're going
in there is for coffee, olive oil, salt.

591
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,360
That's it. Yeah. That's a good
way of looking at you. Stay right,

592
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,780
stay on the outside.
That's where the meat and vegetables are.

593
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,220
Beware of the inside. Just be aware if
you're going in there, go with a purpose.

594
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:40,120
You know, don't get sucked into that damn.

595
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,390
Oh my God. Yup. Because that,
and then the older you get,

596
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,160
the less you can prop your
body can't process that.
Correct. Right. So Diet for me,

597
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:54,660
get up in the morning. It's habitual.
Full quarter water. Since I wake up full,

598
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:59,340
full quarter one, first thing, power
slam. Don't even don't even set it down.

599
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,720
And then, um, why is that? What's the
thought process behind getting that down?

600
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,150
I'm getting it in me.
No waste in time.

601
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,830
It's there for a reason.
I want to cause you wake up dehydrated.

602
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,940
I just want a power.
Slam that and get it all into me.

603
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,650
Um, and then you know, a clean,
I hate to clean breakfast,

604
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:24,651
like a couple of boiled eggs and some
bacon and then throughout the day and

605
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,510
people say, well, is
there a certain amount?

606
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,000
Because too many people
follow too many like diets,

607
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:33,380
which good for them if you're
following my diet, Kudos. Um,

608
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,010
but like meal times,

609
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,290
how many times a day I eat when I'm
hungry and I don't eat til I'm full.

610
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,310
It's, it's pretty freaking simple. Uh,

611
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,430
you don't eat until you're full, so
you're back off, right? Yeah. When you,

612
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,960
what do you hit?
Like 70%.

613
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,480
Yeah. How about that? Something
about that. And then, but port,

614
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,290
a portion of that is thinking,
well,

615
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,590
what if I got a sprint 400 yards,
you know,

616
00:38:57,591 --> 00:39:02,030
or what if I got to kick somebody's ass
right now, right now. And if I'm 100%,

617
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,080
I mean it's going to be
shooting out of both ends.

618
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,280
So I die is freaking huge man.
Huge.

619
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,820
But it allows me to drink
those beers at night. You know,

620
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,830
it allows me to do stuff like that and
then make sure I'm hitting it every day

621
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:24,680
that, uh, you know, the
gym even on the road. Um,

622
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,150
I usually don't have time
for seven days. Uh, and I,

623
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,000
even if I did,
I probably wouldn't,

624
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:37,490
I'd probably take at least
one day off maybe too. Um,

625
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:42,550
but you know as well as I do that you
are more in tuned when you get older to

626
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:47,300
what your body's telling your brain,
your body when you get older says,

627
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,270
you know what? Back the fuck off
today. You don't need any of this shit.

628
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,700
And I listened to that man.

629
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,540
I do listen to that too.
That's so important to listen to that.

630
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:57,450
There's those days where I'm like, man,
I just feel a little off today. I'm like,

631
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,910
I'm being a pussy.
I don't think so.

632
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,160
I'm feeling off and then
all of a sudden I'll start,

633
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,760
my nose will start running and I'll
start coughing a little bit around me are

634
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:06,960
second and I got lucky.

635
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:11,961
I listened and then that call to be gone
a day or two versus if I just go run

636
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:16,260
the hills. Right? Yeah. I'm good to go
sweat it out. That shit is not real.

637
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,210
People say sweat it out.
That is,

638
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,080
unless you're getting in a steam room
or a sauna, he ain't sweating out shit.

639
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,600
You're,

640
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,340
you're twisting your body up and you're
probably going to make your immune

641
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,850
system even weaker. Yup. When you were
talking about those Parkinson's folks,

642
00:40:29,851 --> 00:40:31,440
when they come into your
gym and they do that,

643
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:36,090
do they experience any benefit
in terms of, uh, their function?

644
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,320
Does it,
does it help them?

645
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,260
Absolutely. Absolutely. Um, uh,

646
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,260
and some more than others? Depends. I
think it depends on how, you know, what's,

647
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,900
what stage they're in, how long
they been there. But absolutely.

648
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:54,490
We've got one guy who used to be
a bow hunter and he can't anymore.

649
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,560
So we got to replicating that
motion with rubber bands and he,

650
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,740
you know, he could barely do
a small one. Initially he,

651
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,680
he gave it up because he thought,
you know what,

652
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,630
it's not working for me.
So he kind of gave up.

653
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,920
But once we started working the rubber
bands, he started seeing results.

654
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,130
This is a seven year old man with
Parkinson's. He's like, holy crap, man,

655
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,450
I'm going to be able to drop my bill
again because I'm doing these exercises,

656
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:26,620
you know? And uh, yeah, absolutely. With
a lot of guys, especially with their,

657
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:32,170
their balanced lateral movement.
That's one that I see a lot, you know,

658
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,760
with a lateral movement.
Uh,

659
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,970
they're making a big improvements with
lateral movement and yeah. What helps it?

660
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:42,110
Does weight training help them?
Like what I, I think, um, it's,

661
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,870
it's just getting, getting
that body moving, you know,

662
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:51,080
and then with the, uh, with the boxing,
it's that hand and eye coordination to,

663
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,050
you know, visual being
visually acute, you know,

664
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:57,530
to the spot that you're supposed
to hit on that bag every time.

665
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,910
So it's a combination of the,
uh, because the weights are very,

666
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:05,900
very minimal. You know, we don't want
these guys to get jacked up. And,

667
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,790
and the Gal who runs
it, Laura is pretty, uh,

668
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:15,110
she's pretty cognizant of that, you
know, not wanting them to get jacked up.

669
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:19,930
So their loads are very light when they
do any kind of a weight training. Um,

670
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,600
but I'd always wondered because it
is a neurological disorder. Yup.

671
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,730
But you know what?

672
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,180
They benefit from it because they're
getting out of the fucking house,

673
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,080
out of the hospital and get into a gym.
The wrapping up, they're motivated,

674
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,670
you know, they're fired up to be there
and you know, they're not, they're not,

675
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:43,160
it's obvious that they have Parkinson's.
You know, they're not, you know,

676
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:47,030
running around the ring like Roy
Jones, you know, they're, but they're,

677
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,020
they're fired up to be there
and it's given him purpose.

678
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,860
Yeah. People need purpose, you
know. Yeah. Speaking to me.

679
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:59,270
And then when you retired from
the military, was this, um,

680
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,230
did you envision yourself doing
something along these lines like teaching

681
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:04,970
tactical stuff or,
oh man,

682
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:09,440
I went through some rough patches
as most guys do. Right? Yeah, man,

683
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,720
man, it was, no, I,

684
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm morphed into who I am only in like
the past six or seven years I retired,

685
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:23,411
no five I got hired before even retire
by a corporation to do training stuff.

686
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,450
And um,
I kind of fell,

687
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:34,460
I was almost falling into that
Rut of accepting mediocrity.

688
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,370
Plus what I didn't know is
that, uh, I had depression.

689
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,420
I had to know that because you no idea,
which is common,

690
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:50,350
especially in like the SPEC ops world
guys retire because you been there and in

691
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,610
units with guys with the same guys
for a long, long time and you've,

692
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,430
there's a level of intimacy there that
can't be replicated with another human

693
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:06,800
being.
And then when you retire,

694
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,750
you miss that Camaraderie,
that connection. Um,

695
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,540
so I had working for a
corporation, um, I was, uh,

696
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,650
had a really bad relationship. I was
living in the bonus room and my garage,

697
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:25,460
I'd lived there for five years
because I had a x who is, um,

698
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,300
on chemistry, you know,
prescription meds go big Pharma. Um,

699
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,600
and so the neuro receptors are freaking
gone. I mean delusional and, and, uh,

700
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,010
it was, it was a real bad. Uh,
and then I started booze and,

701
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:45,150
uh, with depression. Um, and I, it,

702
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,630
it didn't even occur to me that dude,
you got a fucking problem.

703
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:51,990
Man didn't even occur, I guess,
which is common with a lot of guys.

704
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,320
But I had an epiphany.
A lot of things happened at one time.

705
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,920
My local cops saved my life.
They said, Bro, you need to
get the fuck out of there.

706
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:04,290
Um, and a bunch of things
happened all at once.

707
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:09,090
And this was in 2013.
Um,

708
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,110
I didn't want to leave because I had
little kids, so I didn't want to, I was,

709
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,400
I was going to stay there.
And, and just the wither away.

710
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,830
Um, and I almost capitulated,
you know, to darkness. Uh,

711
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,340
but I got up before I
went to sleep one night,

712
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,080
my kid is sleeping with me and I'm
hammered and it's like eight at night,

713
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,240
you know, and uh, and um, I had an
epiphany. I said, you know what, I can't,

714
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:41,060
I can't do this and I will not. I remember
saying this to myself, I will not,

715
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,190
I will not be defeated.
I will not be defeated.

716
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,550
And I put my running shoes by the side
of my bed and some shorts set my alarm

717
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:54,060
clock, got up early the next morning
and went for a run, I'll, ah,

718
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:54,903
Forrest Gump

719
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,050
and a pound the pavement for about 10 or
12 miles. And I'm not a runner, you know,

720
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,210
I like to run. I like to sprint.
And when I came back from the run,

721
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:09,850
worked out in my driver
for about an hour and, uh,

722
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,980
my local cops came all happen
at the same time. And, uh,

723
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,880
they came and said, hey bro, get the
fuck out. Kids would be all right.

724
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,100
You need to do this and that. And, um,

725
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,320
then I started, uh, kind of figuring out,

726
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,170
uh,
re uh,

727
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,240
reevaluating my path in
life. Oh, back up a step.

728
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:37,200
I got also got laid off from
this corporation and you know,

729
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:38,490
with a guy in the military,
you don't,

730
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,170
you don't ever think about job
security and whenever tired,

731
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,960
I'm working for a corporation that was
mostly made up of a retired military guys.

732
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,990
So you get laid off and you're like,
what the fuck am I going to do now?

733
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,020
What does that even mean? Getting laid
off? I don't, what am I going to do? Um,

734
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,430
so all that shit happened at
the same time. It was like a,

735
00:46:56,431 --> 00:47:01,431
it was like this massive spiral of
bad events and a man I was able to,

736
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:06,024
um,

737
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,860
I was able to rekindle my own,

738
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,570
my own, my own fire because I recognize,
all right bro, you still got an ember,

739
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,050
you still got this. All you need
to do is just nurture that amber,

740
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,130
turn it into a flame,

741
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,260
turn that into a flame and then just start
adding would add would add wood until

742
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:29,770
it becomes just a perpetual
blaze.

743
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:34,120
And which led me to this thing that I
tell people now, you know, is that, uh,

744
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,950
you got to keep the blaze alive.
Um,

745
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,450
I've got that on t shirts
even because I like,

746
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,800
I like to kick people in the ass who are
willing to sustain their own fire once

747
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:52,150
they get that ass kicking it.
If they can't,

748
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,510
if they can't keep their fire going,
then it's not worth,

749
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,820
it's not worth it for me, you know, to,
to keep kicking them in the ass. Um,

750
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,380
but um, uh, yeah,

751
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:10,240
so ever since that point in time,

752
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,940
you know, getting laid off to
depression, the booze and, uh,

753
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:20,450
I was able to rediscover
me and rebrand and, um,

754
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,410
pretty much start from scratch.
I mean,

755
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:28,210
I had to start life all over again
when I was 48 years old. Wow.

756
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:32,590
Yep. The whole thing from scratch and I
discovered like social media and all this

757
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:37,210
stuff because I've met a gal and I'm
married to her now and she's probably the

758
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:41,500
best purse, one of the best human
beings I've ever met, you know,

759
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,750
all around human being. Um, so she was
able to help me with that and said, hey,

760
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:51,040
you need to do this. You need to get
this social media platform or that one.

761
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,600
And so it's,
it's,

762
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,040
it's detonated pretty well considering
I bet on a short amount of time.

763
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:02,050
Um, but apparently the
message is resonating. Yeah.

764
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,950
So it's a genuine message.
That's why I picked up on it. Oh,

765
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,200
right on. I love that you figured
this shit out. I love that.

766
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,690
That's my favorite thing
when, when, I mean, look,

767
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,820
everybody's prone to mistakes and prone
to depression and people are prone to

768
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,050
hitting rock bottom.
Yup.

769
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,610
Your life can go down a series of bad
roads and you find yourself in a bad

770
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:28,990
relationship or a bad job, a bad
situation in life. And it's very,

771
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:33,700
very difficult at that moment
to have faith and confidence
that you can readjust,

772
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:38,320
reconsider, and reengage.
And that's what you did.

773
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,380
That's awesome. I love that.
I love those kinds of stories.

774
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,700
I love when people get their
shit together and I think that

775
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,310
that helps me help. Other people
weren't sure. You know, cause I could,

776
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,010
I could relate and I don't,
you know,

777
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:57,340
I don't sit down with them and pat
them on the shoulder and say, hey bro,

778
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:01,300
you know, I was there two or anything
like that. I don't even share with them,

779
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,450
but I empathize and that's
sometimes that's all it takes.

780
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,100
He empathize and um, and you
just give him, just get, just,

781
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,890
just that, just a little bit of the right
advice, just a little bit, you know,

782
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,270
not too much. Oftentimes people just
need momentum. They need one good. Right.

783
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,200
That's what I said to that one guy.
Just come to the gym one day. Yeah.

784
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,500
If you have one good day, we eat clean.
You drink a lot of water and you like,

785
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,980
you did,
you got that day,

786
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,110
you woke up, you put your
shoes on, you went for a run,

787
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,680
you worked out your driveway,
you got a good day. Yep. Yep.

788
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,200
That's sometimes all you need to do and
decide this is what I do from now on.

789
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,870
I have good days. Yeah. Tomorrow's
going to be another good day.

790
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:41,150
And then I'm gonna Force myself into
another good day and the next thing you

791
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:43,790
know, I've got some momentum,
right? You've got some momentum.

792
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,710
You could change everything.
I've,

793
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:50,570
I've felt many times in my life I've felt
like I could slip the wrong way and I

794
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:54,920
just, I see it, I see the dark hole and I
go, fuck that and just go the other way.

795
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,310
Go the other way. The problem is,
and people fall into that dark hole.

796
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:02,540
They think that that defines them, but
it's, it doesn't, it doesn't define you.

797
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:05,570
It's just you right now,
you could be totally different tomorrow.

798
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,370
You are a human being.

799
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:10,640
You can think you can adjust
and there's so much inspiration.

800
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:13,670
It's one of the beautiful things
about your Instagram page and many,

801
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:17,000
many other Instagram pages
is that you can take,

802
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:20,930
if you curate your feed correctly and
you don't follow a bunch of knuckleheads,

803
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,700
you can go to your Instagram
or to whatever social
media platform you like and

804
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:30,230
you can go and check out a lot of cool
shit. Oh man, you feel good about it.

805
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:32,840
You get fired up and you want
to do good with your life.

806
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,080
Yup. I, I, uh, I am,

807
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:40,090
I love being inspired by other
guys that I follow on social media.

808
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:45,130
Uh, I'm a motivator, but I like
to be motivated too. Yeah, me too.

809
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,870
So I love,
uh,

810
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:53,020
I've met a lot of really cool people
on, uh, on those platforms, you know,

811
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,900
sitting across from you for example. And
it's not a, it's not cause too many guys,

812
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:03,670
especially like my age, are afraid of
it. You know their friend. Hey Bro,

813
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:07,450
you don't have to, you know, you
don't have to go crazy on it,

814
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:10,960
but you should at least a check
this out and check that out.

815
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,330
And you don't have to
follow thousands of things.

816
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:18,070
But people see like emojis and sponsor,
the fuck is going on.

817
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:21,520
What am I doing here? 15
years old, the fuck is this,

818
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,480
but to right too about, um, we are,

819
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:30,160
we are human beings and we were allowed
to air. And as a matter of fact,

820
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:34,480
in most cases it is a biological
requirement for us to,

821
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,870
for a subjection up.
But when we do,

822
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,640
all we needed to make sure is that it
doesn't become a recurring theme that we'd

823
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:45,850
learned from the past. Prepare for the
future, perform and live in the present.

824
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,540
Expand this. We've been, we've
been blessed with a very,

825
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:54,541
very short existence on this

826
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:00,550
planet that amazes me,
that can, uh, you know,

827
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:04,660
nurture and sustain freaking life and
a solar system that can do the same.

828
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,730
I like to feel insignificant and small,

829
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,790
like looking up at the stars through
a telescope. It's like, Damn, man,

830
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,730
I'm freaking nothing. I have
nothing. I could see the truck,

831
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,930
I could see the Andromeda
galaxy through my telescope.

832
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,120
And that's the closest
one that we can see.

833
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,650
And there's billions of stars
in that galaxy. I guess what?

834
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:30,480
There are billions of galaxies
just like that. Yeah, I mean,

835
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,470
I am,
I am so freaking significant.

836
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,790
So let me make the best of this,

837
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,090
of this time that I have on this,

838
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,160
on this planet with these other
several billion people. Um,

839
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,383
because I mean,

840
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,090
just the fact that I am a human being,
you know,

841
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:56,091
that are strands of DNA wrapped
in protein thrown in with some,

842
00:53:56,281 --> 00:54:01,110
uh, you know, with some amino acids
it's mind blowing that bet. Uh, um,

843
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,870
you know that.
Yeah.

844
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,600
Yeah. No, I feel the
same way all the time.

845
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,710
I [inaudible] it's so easy to get wrapped
up in your own day to day existence

846
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:16,711
and weird little dumb things
and if there's only little
dump things in your life

847
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:21,490
to those dumb things become huge.
When you have big things in your life,

848
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,570
it's easy to look at those dump things
and brush them off. When you're,

849
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:27,730
you're really working hard at something
and you have a lot of positive,

850
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:32,080
positive things going on in your
life, then then it's easier. Like,

851
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,470
what's one of the good things
about really hard exercises?

852
00:54:35,471 --> 00:54:39,190
It's very difficult to do so when
you go to a very difficult, real,

853
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:41,020
or real difficult physical struggle,

854
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,360
the other little bullshit seems like
nothing. It's just really see it,

855
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:49,150
it gets exposed for what it really
is when it really is. It just,

856
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:51,700
it seems like a big deal in the moment,
in the time,

857
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,880
but that's just a trap because your
body needs something to think about.

858
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:59,080
Your body's always worrying. Yeah, your
brain is always focusing on danger.

859
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:02,410
You were worried about threats and
predators, and if there's no predators,

860
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,310
then it's fucking microaggressions.
Then it's you.

861
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,420
It's this guy looked at me
funny at the office. It's like,

862
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,120
this bitch is always parking
in the spot. I want, you know,

863
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:14,860
like the people get weird. You get,
you start focusing on nonsense.

864
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:17,250
I'm in my new shit.
Yeah, but I think it's,

865
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:21,220
I think that's one of the primary benefits
of physical exercise is not just that

866
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:24,610
it blows out all that excess energy,
but I think your body stores up,

867
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:25,444
and I always,

868
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,540
the way I was described as at a person's
body is almost like a battery that's

869
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,640
leaking energy.
Like you've got to purge it.

870
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,180
You got to purge it of that excess
energy because it has certain physical

871
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:38,030
requirements. Then on top of that,
the physical difficulty of, you know,

872
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,450
running a hard row,
know two,

873
00:55:40,451 --> 00:55:44,530
three miles in the mountains or wherever
you're at or doing like, uh, you know,

874
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,260
crazy crossfit workout or
whatever the fuck you like to do.

875
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,400
Taking a Jujitsu class,

876
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:53,380
that shit is so hard that all that other
nonsense and your life gets it puts

877
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,860
into perspective. Then
from there, then look up,

878
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,780
then look up at the whole stars and go,
man,

879
00:55:58,781 --> 00:56:03,610
you're just lucky to be experiencing this,
right. To be able to think about this,

880
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:08,410
to be this person that's living in the
most amazing time ever for human beings

881
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,830
might be spinning around on this
ball flying through infinity.

882
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,890
It's nothing but gravy. Yep. Yup.

883
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,420
It provides you with, with great, uh, uh,

884
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:22,070
like centering balance,
you know, and expect.

885
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:27,070
Yeah. And um, man, what else? You
said something that uh, you know,

886
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:30,710
we talked about that, uh, people
focusing on the, my new show. Oh,

887
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,410
the other thing

888
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,130
you were saying how it's just a,

889
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:43,330
it's a sticking point with me
is all is um, how uh, you know,

890
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,760
we human beings primal,
our primal thought,

891
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:49,060
we worry about no dangers
and stuff like that. But man,

892
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:54,061
it's amazing how at how many people
nowadays have relinquished that pri there,

893
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,820
there their primal defense mechanisms,
you know, of like awareness said,

894
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,420
mobility,
all that they've just given,

895
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,610
they've given up their fat, dumb, lazy,

896
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:11,410
happy button pushers.

897
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:15,910
Flacid and complacent just walking
around a 45 degree syndrome.

898
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,490
Yeah.
I'm on that bus today.

899
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:23,491
Going to go to the rental car place
from lax and everybody's on the phone,

900
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,660
which, you know, there's times you could
be in the white, but I look around, I go,

901
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,280
well it looks like I'm on security right
now because nobody else is frigging,

902
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:34,330
you know, going to see this
or that happened. Yeah.

903
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:37,450
There's a ton of people that are just
staring at their phone all day long and

904
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:39,430
not paying attention to
their surroundings at all.

905
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:42,970
And it's not that you need to all
the time. Most of the time you don't.

906
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,940
But the time when you do,
boy,

907
00:57:45,941 --> 00:57:50,050
that could change your life or the life
of your loved ones. Yup. Yup. And, and

908
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,360
walking around the streets is
not the time to do it. You know,

909
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,360
there's a time to be in the
white and you know, when you,

910
00:57:58,361 --> 00:57:59,051
you know what I'm talking about,

911
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:02,190
what the white like Cooper's
color code white to black,

912
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,450
white is like Zombie mode.
And that's, you know,

913
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:09,490
me and my house and my range of
panties watching TV or whatever.

914
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:14,340
That's the time when
you're allowed to be loud,

915
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:17,560
to be in the white where black is, you
know, you're fighting for your life.

916
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,180
Horrible, horrific,
terrifying. But, um, you know,

917
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:25,770
in the streets you gotta be, at
least in the yellow, you know,

918
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,290
just have your wits
about you a little bit.

919
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,200
So let me take you back to when you
decided to get your shit together,

920
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:36,910
you decided to get your shit together
again. You begin the process.

921
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,150
And then how did you get to
where you're at now? Well, I,

922
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:45,070
I'm getting laid off was scary as hell.
But sometime you know,

923
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,000
when you're in crisis mode like that you,

924
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,830
you think most efficiently
there's a, there's a, there's a,

925
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,790
there's a series of things that happen.
One is, you know, you get scared of death,

926
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,760
right? Laid off Skype. I
think that was the first one.

927
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:01,980
Scared and then angry and this is
over a couple of days, you know,

928
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:05,410
and then focus.
When I got focused,

929
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,150
I built my company t Max.
Um,

930
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,480
I mean I just thought of everything, you
know, I just had one epiphany after I,

931
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,270
what am I going to call
it? You know, her own,

932
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,330
let me just make up an
acronym that sounds cool.

933
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,080
And the cover all the basis
training, marksmanship,
adventure, concept, security.

934
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:23,750
I covered t max and then,
um,

935
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,650
uh, and then um, man, shit just hit me.

936
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,790
I was so freaking fortune cause shit fell
into place for me. I had guys who were,

937
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:40,460
who I trained for this corporation called
the corporation and say, Hey, we want,

938
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,970
uh, you know, pat Mac to come train
us again. And they said, well,

939
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,930
he's no longer here, but we
could have somebody else do
it. And they were like, no,

940
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,590
we don't want somebody
else, you know, wha, Eh,

941
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,270
we don't care what it's called
or what your branding it.

942
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,650
We want this guy doing it. So they
were able to get in contact with me.

943
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:58,850
It was a big contract.

944
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:02,980
And then another one came up and then
another one all in the same year.

945
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,050
I was like, are you his all
tactical training? And it was all,

946
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,270
so that year was complete.
Um,

947
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:14,000
and then I had a bunch of
different, uh, you know,

948
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:16,040
lessons learned like government contracts,

949
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:21,020
Shit like secret station number
at 2013 with a week. Anyway,

950
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,290
sequence duration. So government
contracting and stuff like that.

951
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:28,550
It all went away. So there was a time and
13 where I didn't work for six months,

952
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,340
you know, it was, it's, it's
scary when you're working on your,

953
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:35,030
when you're doing everything
for and by yourself,

954
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:40,040
all your own admin and everything
like that. It could be,

955
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:44,270
it's very exciting but scary
shit. Yeah. Yeah. It's like,

956
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,250
damn man, you know, I keep Jane,

957
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,710
I don't care how much stuff I have in the
pipeline. Mikey jam and more shit. Yeah.

958
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,260
But once, uh, so I had those
government contracts, then

959
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,120
I just, I just built momentum and
it started learning. All right,

960
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,930
let's get rid of this. Let's do more
of this. Let's not do focus on that.

961
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:10,250
Let's focus on this. Uh, and um, it grew,

962
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:14,690
it grew into a,
into a very,

963
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,850
it's like self fulfilling machine.
You know, it's a, a, it's,

964
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,100
it's, it's, it's running,
running very well right now,

965
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,950
but it was not easy getting there.
I mean,

966
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,200
there was a lot of bumps
and obstacles in the road,

967
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:34,850
but I tell guys that all the time, man,
any, any, any road we're traveling,

968
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,910
you're probably,
you're going to have obstacles in it.

969
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,470
There's going to be temptation
like shortcuts, you know,
nope. Stay on that road,

970
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:47,000
Bro. Stand that road, go through those pot
holes, go over those freaking bumps. Um,

971
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,070
this road it's going to suck,

972
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:52,250
but after awhile it will smooth
out and sure enough, you know,

973
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,990
my road smoothed out and the bumps
are few and far between right now.

974
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,920
Um, so yeah, man, I'm, I'm,

975
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,630
I'm the happiest I've ever been
in my life probably right now,

976
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,830
54 years old. And, uh, I, I've,

977
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,630
it's like I've grown up that,
but that's smart. I mean that's,

978
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:19,260
if you're a person who's thinking and
trying to do better with your life,

979
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:21,430
you should be at your best right now.
Yup.

980
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,700
She'll be at your best or
how you perceive things,

981
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,310
how you decide to approach things,
how you look at things.

982
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,440
So when you're doing these, uh,
these tactical courses and you're,

983
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:32,450
you're traveling so much, um, that,

984
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:37,260
that's very hard on your body. That's why
one of the hardest things on your body,

985
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:42,210
right? All that travel. Yeah.
It'll say especially so, you know,

986
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:42,660
I,

987
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:47,660
I travel with two big cases cause I
have a gun case and a gear case and uh,

988
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:52,650
uh, you become a travel pro, but it
still sucks, right? You get up early,

989
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:55,590
drive an hour to the airport,
wait an hour to get your plane,

990
01:02:55,620 --> 01:03:00,570
take that plane to this place and then
you know, another plane to this place.

991
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:04,770
Getting a rental car, go to
your hotel, has a travel with
the guns too, right? Yeah.

992
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:09,660
Well only because it's different in
every airport in Alaska than you used to

993
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:13,330
guns like, yeah, yeah. Alaska,
Wyoming, places like that. Yep.

994
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:18,570
But it's different in every airport,
so there's no consistency.

995
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,200
Even though, you know, I know what the
webpage says, I know what it says. Right.

996
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,330
And I buy,
but they don't know what it says.

997
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:28,690
I have no idea what I travel with
my bow. I find that lax. Right.

998
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:32,490
Depending upon who I talked to, like
some people I go, yeah, it's a bow.

999
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,580
What are you doing? Oh, I bow hunt. They
go, okay, cool. That's fine. Other people,

1000
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:39,990
like, I don't think you can travel with
this one. I definitely can. A manager,

1001
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,370
let's go to the website,
Jesus Christ and uh, you know,

1002
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,060
give myself an extra hour just in case
shit like that happens. And I do that.

1003
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,470
I definitely,

1004
01:03:49,471 --> 01:03:54,471
I give that I planned for that extra now
or just in case I gotta Piss and Moan.

1005
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:59,030
Right. Um, but, uh, some of
them are real smooth, you know,

1006
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,230
airports are real smooth.
Others are painted the deck.

1007
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,110
But people must look at you weird though,
right? Yeah, a little bit. I mean,

1008
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:09,000
they know me at my airport. Um,
but you're also North Carolina.

1009
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:13,140
It's a different animal to bring
something like that to California.

1010
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,300
People are like, oh, California is not to,

1011
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:18,840
it's not as horrible as
[inaudible] heaven. Yeah.

1012
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:23,220
But it's not as horrible as some other
states. New York. Oh yeah. That's,

1013
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:25,820
forget about it. Yeah. You can't
even have a handgun in that.

1014
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:29,550
It's so hard to get a handgun. You
see, you got like New Jersey, New York,

1015
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:34,230
Connecticut. Um, yeah. States like
that. Oh, Jesus freaking. Yeah.

1016
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:36,140
They have very strange gun laws there.

1017
01:04:36,141 --> 01:04:38,760
I guess it's just because
they've got so much violence.

1018
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:42,720
They thought that that was the
solution. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

1019
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,010
I don't know. Do you, so do you,
uh, what do you enjoy the most?

1020
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:49,230
Do you enjoy doing the social media stuff?

1021
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:52,350
Do you enjoy doing the tactical training?
Like what do you enjoy doing the most?

1022
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,050
Um, I, I like doing,

1023
01:04:55,230 --> 01:05:00,070
I like doing the workout
stuff more than anything, uh,

1024
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:05,180
because I think with that I reach and
help more people even if they could be.

1025
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,290
Um, and it's amazing. It's amazing.
It's like, you know, I have so many,

1026
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,420
I don't know how this has happened,

1027
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:18,260
but I bet I have morphed into this guy
who people rely on to motivate them and

1028
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:22,240
they tell me, bro, you're, you're
motivated. The hell out of me,

1029
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,860
which fires me up is my buddy. Cj
says, what motivates a motivator?

1030
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:29,620
Tell him you're motivating
them, you know? So, um,

1031
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:34,120
so I love doing that stuff because it
touches a lot of people regardless of

1032
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:38,910
their age or their physical ability.
And a lot of guys may be, um, you know,

1033
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,660
bed ridden with an illness or something
like that and, uh, it'll fire them up.

1034
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:48,340
So I like doing that stuff. I
think next would be the, uh,

1035
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:51,130
the shooting thing. I mean, I love it.

1036
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:55,120
I love running courses
and meet new people.

1037
01:05:55,180 --> 01:06:00,180
I meet a dozen new people every week
and from all walks of life and a guy,

1038
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:05,330
all different reasons. Motivations
for doing it. Yup. And, and um, guys,

1039
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,090
you know, they'll ask me during
the class, they say, Bro, what,

1040
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,790
how do you stay motivated to duties
almost every week? And I say,

1041
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:16,780
cause I get to meet guys like you bro.
I mean it's as simple as that.

1042
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,130
If you find enthusiastic people teaching
them, that helps a lot. Yup. Yeah.

1043
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,750
So, you know, I like to fire people
up, but I like to get it in return.

1044
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:26,850
Do you find a lot of

1045
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,580
guys that are also retired
from the military? They,

1046
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,700
they want to talk to you about this
because they're trying to figure it out

1047
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:31,900
there.
Yeah.

1048
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:36,370
Path. Uh, a couple of them have hit me
up and I am man open arms. I'm like,

1049
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:41,440
let me show you whatever you want to
know cause I figured this out. So Yep.

1050
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,850
I'm your huckleberry. Uh,
it's not many of them,

1051
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:50,320
but there bang, there'll be,
you know, half dozen a year who,

1052
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:53,080
who will ping me, hey, I want to
get into the training in history.

1053
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:55,600
Like it's plenty of room for it.
Every guy,

1054
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:59,240
no, that's either been spec ops, seal,

1055
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:00,890
whatever they've been when they retire.

1056
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,770
It's one of the hardest
moments of their life. Yeah.

1057
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:07,220
It's so hard for them to find
some purpose and there's,

1058
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:11,900
it's hard for them to find routes to just
to really feel like they belong again

1059
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,270
because that life is so intense.

1060
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:19,430
Yup. Yeah. Cause you have, you know,
you have meaning. Yeah. You know,

1061
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,330
and it's, and it's, and
it's selfless. You're doing
something bigger than yourself.

1062
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,830
Yeah.
And

1063
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:31,400
so yeah, because you want, once again,

1064
01:07:31,401 --> 01:07:33,170
if you're just in a,
if you just find a,

1065
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:38,120
let's say a job where you're working
and maybe even working for the man,

1066
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:40,400
there's no more, there's no meaning
there. Right. You're not doing,

1067
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,950
you're not a part of something
bigger than yourself. Right.

1068
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:48,050
So I always tell guys, hey, when whenever
you get out, when you have you separate,

1069
01:07:48,051 --> 01:07:51,560
especially if you've got, you know,
20 plus years and that's a long time,

1070
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:58,280
you are going to be adversely affected
no matter how bad ass you are upstairs,

1071
01:07:58,281 --> 01:08:03,220
you're going to be some degree. Yeah. Um,
you know, it could be a little depressed.

1072
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:05,420
It could be a lot.
Um,

1073
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:10,340
but if you find something and it could
be working for a charity, you know,

1074
01:08:10,341 --> 01:08:13,550
whatever, if you find
something that, where you could

1075
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,000
with impunity,

1076
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,560
go to sleep and look forward to
the next day where you say, Matt,

1077
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,060
Tomorrow's going to be freaking awesome.

1078
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,550
I can't wait because I got
this project pending in,

1079
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:29,900
I'm going to help so many
people be better people.

1080
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,650
Um,
then if you could do that,

1081
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,640
I mean find that instead
of just, you know, uh,

1082
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,810
getting stuck in a Rut, you know,
instead of accepting mediocrity, but, uh,

1083
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:47,300
cause that meaning
purpose, fullness and, and,

1084
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,140
and uh,

1085
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:52,820
selfless being doing something selfless
and being a part of something bigger

1086
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:54,320
than yourself is freaking huge.

1087
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:57,110
Do they prepare you at all when you're
getting ready to retire? And they said,

1088
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:01,450
good luck. Yup. Sianora they just figured
you're a bad ass and figure it out. Yep.

1089
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,010
Wow. Yep. You're making the
choice because you can stay.

1090
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,690
I know I could have stayed
another 10 years or what
have you. So you're doing it,

1091
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,090
you're making that choice.
Did you decide to leave? Um,

1092
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,270
there was a, uh, you know,
kind of a defining moment.

1093
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,740
I had to do some soul searching.
Um,

1094
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,560
it was all I had 22 years in.
I lost a couple of buds,

1095
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,010
uh,
at that moment.

1096
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,400
And I had two little kitties at home,

1097
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,160
so I had to do some soul searching and I
thought, well, we'll, there'll be, we'll,

1098
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:41,740
there'll be, will there be any regret
whatsoever. And I, and I thought, man, I,

1099
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:45,530
I pretty much, I've done it all, you know,

1100
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:50,150
as far as like special ops goes, I, I am
not going to have any Gretz cause I did.

1101
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:54,470
That was a big thing, you know, will I
regret this? And I said to myself, no,

1102
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:58,980
I won't. So, you know, I, uh, I
decided to retire with 22 and,

1103
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:02,780
and it was all special. I
was very fortunate. My whole
career was special ops,

1104
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:07,520
the whole thing. Um, but
I did regret it after,

1105
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:11,960
I'm sure it take long. It was, you know,
and it got worse every year that passed,

1106
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:16,490
they got worse and worse. And
I was like, man, I should just,

1107
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:21,050
well, it's gotta be so hard, even for,
not just for you, but for, I mean,

1108
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,620
not just for the soldiers,
but for the wives. Yeah.

1109
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:29,150
To know that the husband is constantly
in these crazy situations overseas

1110
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,680
constantly in these very,
very dangerous environments.

1111
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,640
We have the stress of that.
Yeah.

1112
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:41,350
I think it takes a special
kind on both sides, you know,

1113
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,700
and usually,
uh,

1114
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,280
usually spouses have a pretty
good support mechanism to,

1115
01:10:47,281 --> 01:10:51,320
with the units and other spouses
and that kind of thing. So yeah,

1116
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:54,830
usually they're pretty, they're
pretty tough and they get used to it.

1117
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,710
It becomes a way of life. It
becomes a normal, right? Yup.

1118
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,890
But yeah, still miss it, I'm sure.
Yeah. Well, everyone I talked to does,

1119
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:12,000
have you ever read, um, Sebastian
Junger's book tribe? Oh yeah. Yeah.

1120
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,770
I just, just recently I didn't, I, uh,

1121
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:20,790
listened to it on a freaking
bad ass. Yeah. I loved it. Yeah.

1122
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,800
He's great reading it too.
It's a,

1123
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:26,520
it's an excellent book and it
does it explain in your eyes,

1124
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:31,080
I thought he did a pretty good job with
that whole thing. Yup. Yup. Absolutely.

1125
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:35,130
Yup. I thought he was,
yeah, pretty much spot on.

1126
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:40,850
I was north and south in my head as I
was driving down I 95 listening to that

1127
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:42,054
book.

1128
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:47,170
So it's safe to say that you went through
this period post-military where you

1129
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,400
just were really just trying
to find yourself again, but
then you caught it. Yeah.

1130
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,200
And then he caught it and now you seem
like you're in your glory. Hell yeah.

1131
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,250
Like I said, I really enjoy your page,
man. Oh, right. It's really tense.

1132
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:03,870
And you're also kind of, you're a bad
ass, but you're fun with it. Yeah. Right.

1133
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,210
Good time. You know? Yeah. I, I
love, I love doing, I love the um,

1134
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,730
both the uh,
doing the,

1135
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,850
the Youtube Channel and a pm Ige.

1136
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:18,660
And I put thought, I, you know,
I, I put some thought into it.

1137
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:22,110
And your wife helped you with this stuff,
does she, she helped me set stuff up.

1138
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:24,420
She's like,
cause I didn't know any of this stuff was,

1139
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:29,810
so we got married and we
met in like fall of 13.

1140
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:35,660
And then the first social media platform
I had was Facebook cause somebody

1141
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,830
posing as me. Oh, that's hilarious. So I,

1142
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:43,050
in order to report them,
I needed to get an account

1143
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,120
and then once I did, I friend
requested this guy who was posting it,

1144
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:52,130
pose it has me in any way. What did
he say? Why was he doing it? Uh,

1145
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,990
I figured it out.
I did some detective work,

1146
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:57,840
but he was posing as me
because he wanted a bash,

1147
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:01,950
somebody else in the gun industry
and pose as somebody credible.

1148
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:07,920
So this guy that he was bashing
contacted me and said, hey,

1149
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:12,710
why are you saying this? And I don't
talk shit about anybody. Right. So like,

1150
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:17,740
Roe, I think you got the wrong
guy. And uh, I said, just
call me up. Here's my name.

1151
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:22,640
And uh, we had a Chitchat and he goes,
Oh man, I got some bad news for you.

1152
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:27,600
You do have a Facebook account, let me
send me awake and everything. Yeah. But,

1153
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:30,870
um, so I started that one. I
already had a couple of youtube

1154
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:37,110
videos up,
but then I just went full bore with it,

1155
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,470
you know, when, when kind of
bat shit. And then the, uh,

1156
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:45,810
the ige was fun man. When Rebecca, my
wife showed me that, that was probably,

1157
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:50,460
I think, uh, I think five, I'm five
years into that and I figured it out.

1158
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:55,440
You know, what my audience
wants. I pay attention to,

1159
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,150
you know, that the, the uh, analytics.

1160
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:04,110
Do you really? Yeah, I,
yeah, I'll only because, um,

1161
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,270
yeah, because I want to, right? Yeah.

1162
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:12,700
Because I want to give them what they
want versus what do you get out of the

1163
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:17,650
analytics? What does it show the
d, The age group, the time of day,

1164
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:21,870
you know, what those kinds of things,
but also the amount of views. And, uh,

1165
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:26,370
what's the other word? The, uh,
not views, but, um, the reach. Yup.

1166
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,340
So, you know, what's the, uh,

1167
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:35,410
it's the videos do the best and uh,

1168
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:39,310
if they're short, like I do a lot of
around the Acom at strength training.

1169
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:45,280
So I, I, uh, supplement my ebook
quick little workout snippets. Hey,

1170
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,530
this is another example of a
power thing, blah, blah, blah.

1171
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:50,770
So I'm putting information in there
as well. You know, I jot down Info,

1172
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,690
so make sure you work in the transverse
plane. Hama Hama you know, uh,

1173
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:58,590
rate of force production, no speed,
no power, blah, blah, blah. Um,

1174
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:02,350
and this could be supplemented with
a resistance band instead of a wait.

1175
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,460
So I pay attention to that stuff
because that's what people want.

1176
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,920
That's where I get the most
feedback guys. Like, Bro,

1177
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,250
thank you so much for putting this
sound like how right, man. So I'm hell,

1178
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:17,170
you know, I know for a fact
that I'm helping people or
if I put a, maybe a course,

1179
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:22,171
a fire out or talk about specific way
to clean up and break down in 1911,

1180
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,030
you know,
whatever it is.

1181
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:30,090
When I put out information it resonates
better and it seems that it's more

1182
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:33,040
palatable with the,
with the,

1183
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,830
with the masses of the people who are
following me because I get a lot and man,

1184
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:41,420
I, I answer all those freaking comments.
A lot of them, I mean, I spend,

1185
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:46,930
I spend how many followers
you have on ige hundred 60.

1186
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,080
[inaudible] how the fuck can you
possibly answer all those things?

1187
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,690
A lot of them are just hitting the like,

1188
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,930
and sometimes that means a
lot to people. Man. You know,

1189
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:59,830
I'll have guys screenshot and Pat
Max liked my comment, you know.

1190
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:04,360
Um, but uh, it's a couple hours.

1191
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:07,720
I'll spend I think two hours
a day is what I do. Um,

1192
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:12,120
the association like email, then
I could get to work, you know,

1193
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:16,120
I don't have to fuck with that anymore,
but it's usually about that much. Well,

1194
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:19,870
your page makes me want to take a
tactical course. He wanted to do that.

1195
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:22,870
Where would they go?
They go to my website.

1196
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:27,840
Tmx Inc com to you? Anyone
out here in la? Yeah.

1197
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,570
I used to come out here all the time.
The only reason it's not the gun thing,

1198
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:35,440
just I'm getting travel every man that
three hour time zone smokes and shit out

1199
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:38,920
of me. You ever go to Australia? No,

1200
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:41,620
I been invited to do courses there,

1201
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:46,380
but there's a whole new nother thing we
training overseas. It's, you know, it's,

1202
01:16:46,381 --> 01:16:49,300
it's a State Department, Department of
State thing and I tars and all that.

1203
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:50,920
It's a pain in the deck,
I'm sure.

1204
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:55,150
So I'm just trying to blow these guys on.
Here it is.

1205
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,660
Take a live CST course.
Oh yeah.

1206
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:02,170
The CST co I don't do them live
much anymore only because, uh, they,

1207
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:03,850
they didn't,
um,

1208
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,230
they didn't sell and Phil
will because people would,

1209
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,270
I think they thought that it
was going to be a beat down. Oh,

1210
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,610
you were going to go and kick
her out. But it's, it's very,

1211
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:17,420
it's a lot of information and a lot
of feel and stuff out, you know?

1212
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,650
So what is it, what is a CST course?
What, what does that mean? Uh, well,

1213
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:26,390
it's basically replicating what I
have in that ebook and people say,

1214
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:31,340
Bro, put this book in
hard cover. It's 35 pages,

1215
01:17:31,341 --> 01:17:33,260
man. It's not cost productive,
you know what I mean?

1216
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:37,640
Just download it and print
it out. Would you, oh my God.

1217
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,190
What is the CST,

1218
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:45,460
CST course would replicate what I have
in that book within a day's period.

1219
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:46,670
Okay.

1220
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:51,670
So it's a good supplement for those who
have the book because I do all of the

1221
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:55,430
classroom with a white board stuff,
you know, you break the workweek down,

1222
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:59,060
power day, strength train speed
and quickness, hypertrophy
skills and then, uh,

1223
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:02,720
talk about, you know, east
centric, concentric, isometric,

1224
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:06,290
transverse sagittal.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?

1225
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,590
Got To have Naza,
you know,

1226
01:18:09,591 --> 01:18:13,420
National Academy of Sports
Medicine because I wanted to, um,

1227
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,850
you know, it's freaking piece of paper
to me, six months to get. But um,

1228
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,290
I wanted to, I wanted to have a
piece of paper to back up. Right.

1229
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:29,240
And that was the closest thing that
I've found to what I was putting out.

1230
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:32,840
And it w it was pretty spot on.

1231
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:36,560
Only mine is way cooler, you
know, it's not like the lame,

1232
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:41,330
uh, you know, health club
version. Got It. Right.

1233
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,320
More tactical and
practical, right? Yup. Yup.

1234
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,310
So the class would,

1235
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:51,950
it basically just encompass what's
in the book in a one day period.

1236
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:56,180
And now it's more like tangible because
see people are touching it, feeling it,

1237
01:18:56,181 --> 01:19:00,200
seeing it, you know, these
certain exercises versus
seeing a picture of it. Right.

1238
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:04,070
But there's a lot of good
information in that, in that book.

1239
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:08,900
And then I supplement both my youtube
channel and I g with all these other

1240
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:12,410
little snippets and it's hot, man.
I put out a lot of information.

1241
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,660
I mean a lot.
So

1242
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,830
people will get bored cause I don't want
people to get bored with their workout

1243
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,880
chick.
I want them to,

1244
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:24,080
I'll do it as teaching them how to
cook and it's showing them ingredients.

1245
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:27,290
And I'll go cook your own meal and here's,
you know, here's some of the recipes.

1246
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,290
Throw these, throw these ingredients
into your, into your pot. Um,

1247
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:36,530
so that's what I do with the social
media platform is a supplement that with,

1248
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,810
you know,
whatever.

1249
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:42,880
I'll come up with some dumb ass name
for some movement that I'm doing. Uh,

1250
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:48,260
but they're good,
functional, safe, low impact,

1251
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,180
uh, movements that encourage,
you know, it's self preservation,

1252
01:19:53,181 --> 01:19:58,100
longevity in fitness and that brokenness
too many.

1253
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:01,330
Oh my God. Too many guys,
especially older guys, you know,

1254
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,240
doing herky jerky stuff and,
and uh, getting hurt in the gym,

1255
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,980
especially when they take a long
time off and then forget that

1256
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,930
their bodies 56, not
26. Yeah, super common.

1257
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,070
So when you,
if people go to your,

1258
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:19,170
was a combat strength training.com
so what it's called for the CST,

1259
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:21,560
but that's not for my
courses. That's right. Um,

1260
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:26,940
like tactical stuff is t Mac sync. Okay.
Is, is there a link to that from there?

1261
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:32,490
Yeah, I'll call it t max is my,
that's who I am. So t Max Inc.

1262
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,170
And then from there there's
areas of the performance. Yeah.

1263
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:42,290
Cancel bastard jacket too. Yeah,
man. So this is all like V,

1264
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,560
it's got a lot of your videos up there.
It shows you what you're doing. Yep.

1265
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:50,270
And it's got all the courses and
it's kind of bad ass store too. Man.

1266
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,370
I got some booty on that store,

1267
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:56,470
so, oh tools. Ooh, get
you some. So when your,

1268
01:20:56,590 --> 01:21:00,700
when you put in all these different
workouts together, um, uh, how much, uh,

1269
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:04,560
how much did they change? Did it like
when you, if someone goes to your,

1270
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:06,760
your website and once a
fall of your courses, right,

1271
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:11,720
the physical stuff. Yeah. Oh, the, the,

1272
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:16,830
the core, um, work out
doesn't change that much.

1273
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,820
The movements do.

1274
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,680
So I break the work week down into a
POW like Monday for instance, power day,

1275
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:27,960
then strength day, speed and
quickness, hypertrophy skills.

1276
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,470
And then there's a couple, cause people
don't have five days, you could lump,

1277
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:36,390
for instance, speed, power, you
can love strength and hypertrophy.

1278
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,340
Um, the, uh, so the,

1279
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,940
the just stays the same power day,

1280
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:48,410
work in anaerobic chunks in
circuit to near metabolic too.

1281
01:21:48,411 --> 01:21:52,830
I show up to meet in a robe and go pick
e five good power exercises and make

1282
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:57,690
sure that two of Marin transverse
plane. Um, and if they got the book,

1283
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:01,620
they'd be able to, that could
sustain them for just with that,

1284
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,780
for let's say, I dunno, whatever
months, uh, without getting bored.

1285
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,740
But they definitely want to go to like,
uh,

1286
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,800
some of the stuff on that I put on the
interwebs to help sustain and keep the

1287
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,950
ideas fresh. Right. Cause we don't
want to fall into that. Once again,

1288
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:22,410
that Rut of complacent adaptation,
you know,

1289
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:26,070
we're doing the same shit over and over
and over day by day and too many guys do

1290
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,370
that and it's,
it's not healthy.

1291
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:31,770
I noticed you incorporate a
lot of martial arts stuff too.

1292
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,910
Like you were doing some arm drags the
other day. Yup. Yeah. Like what do you,

1293
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:35,813
what do you,

1294
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:40,850
do you just do this for like practical
applications in a street fight scenario

1295
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:41,530
or,

1296
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:46,150
yes. So yeah, I got, I'm a
big fan of uh, different,

1297
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:47,733
different fight

1298
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:49,340
and you're doing all this stuff.

1299
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:52,790
You do it with shoes on cause it's
how you're going to be in real life.

1300
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,830
Most of the time

1301
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:56,860
I don't go into our fight room, which
shoes because it's got mats in there.

1302
01:22:56,861 --> 01:23:00,610
It's nice. So you know, where we,
where we, where we grapple and work,

1303
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,980
even work bags,
I'm bare footed,

1304
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:06,100
but usually there's a lot of times
I'm working and these woods with

1305
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,810
a gun on two, which is appendix
carry on or my tee shirt. Um,

1306
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:15,480
so you keep it unloaded or oh yeah.
In the chair. Correct. So, you know,

1307
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,190
cause it impedes your
movement a little bit. Yup.

1308
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,590
Just to make sure that it
doesn't impede my mood,

1309
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,850
but just to know where it is that,
right.

1310
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:26,830
So there's a place where you could keep
it, where you can move just as well.

1311
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:30,220
And so this dude that you're working with,
he's a wrestler. Yeah, he's good man.

1312
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,550
Randy's good. And what is, uh,
what is he working with you on?

1313
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:36,620
You're just working on this was this,
we're,

1314
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,030
we're not the sharpest right here because
this was after a power workout where

1315
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:43,600
smoked. Right. We're smoked and all
we're doing here is just control,

1316
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,640
just stand up for control, you know?
And um, I used to be a good wrestler,

1317
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:51,000
but my game is off and um,

1318
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,160
cause but that was
decades and decades ago.

1319
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,650
So Randy's gay.

1320
01:23:56,750 --> 01:24:01,750
Then he's training for a
competition and just to competition.

1321
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:06,760
I think it's a, it's a kind
of a mixed, uh, uh, wrestling,

1322
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,990
Jujitsu, a competition. I
think he's doing the wrestling,

1323
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm pretty sure. So I said, hey bro,
let's, uh, let's start mixing it up.

1324
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:20,260
I want to get back into, um,
you know, Roland, some more,

1325
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,520
uh,
because I'm bigger here,

1326
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:26,590
so it'd be good for him because I'm
bigger and stronger than he is. So,

1327
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:32,200
and then it'll be good for me too.
I used to do a lot of fight training,

1328
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,240
especially a boxing,
kickboxing,

1329
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:38,370
little tentative on getting punched
in the face anymore for your hand.

1330
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:42,310
I have degenerative spine.
What's going on with your neck?

1331
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:47,100
Degenerative spine, degenerative
disc disease. Right.

1332
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,960
There's, that's very
controversial. You know,

1333
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,630
a lot of people say that it's a disease.

1334
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,720
Then I talked to a physiologist
and they say, well, what it is,

1335
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:59,810
is pressure on your desk because you're
lifting a lot of weights while you're

1336
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:03,550
involved in something that presses down
on you and then you just degenerate.

1337
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,740
It's not like a disease that's
causing this to go away. Yeah.

1338
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:11,910
That that disease air quotes almost
always happens in people that are involved

1339
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:14,860
with very strenuous physical exercise.
Yup.

1340
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,670
And so there's different ways that you
can kind of mitigate some of that stuff.

1341
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:23,650
Do you ever do spinal decompression? Uh,
no. I have no, I haven't done that one,

1342
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:28,150
man. There's a harness that you could
buy on Amazon. It's like 39 bucks.

1343
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:31,660
Hang from a door. Yes. Yup. Pull that
click, click, click, click, click.

1344
01:25:31,661 --> 01:25:35,440
And it stretches sometimes.
Just that alone give you a lot of relief.

1345
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:39,610
Now I do have an inversion
table and that's freaking great.

1346
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:42,040
I have one of those two.
Yeah, those are great.

1347
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:44,500
And then there's another
machine called a reverse hyper.

1348
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:47,260
That's fantastic for your lower back.
I'll show it to you outside.

1349
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:49,540
We have one in the other,
uh, in the gym area,

1350
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:52,410
but that also actively decompresses and,

1351
01:25:52,411 --> 01:25:55,650
and strengthens all those muscles
around your back as well. But the, the,

1352
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:58,900
the stuff with the neck
too, um, there's another,

1353
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,820
there's a bunch of different
things you could do. I mean,

1354
01:26:00,821 --> 01:26:03,890
I don't know if you do any neck exercises,
do you, do you fuck with anything? Oh,

1355
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:04,940
yeah, yeah, yeah,

1356
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,990
yeah. It at least at least once
a week. And I've got to, yeah.

1357
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,090
I always tope guys kicked through
to got to work your neck man

1358
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:16,280
ports command center. Right,
right, right. Have to now you,

1359
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:19,420
you said that it's disc degeneration,
so you don't want to get choked.

1360
01:26:19,421 --> 01:26:21,130
Is that what it is? You don't
want to get your neck manipulate?

1361
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:25,450
Yeah. Um, because like
my distal Phalanges,

1362
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:29,920
there's numbness there and
uh, you know, like sleeping,

1363
01:26:29,921 --> 01:26:33,520
I have to sleep like a corpse,
so there's no rolling or anything.

1364
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:35,470
Just straight corpse.

1365
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,230
So the numbness is indicates
is something pressing on your,

1366
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,680
that decompression device will help you
a lot? Yeah, it's cheap too. Like I said,

1367
01:26:44,681 --> 01:26:48,700
it's like 30 bucks or 39 bucks, something
like that. But that, that's soccer, man.

1368
01:26:48,701 --> 01:26:52,750
I get in that thing and click,
click, click, click, click,
hang in a little bit. Just,

1369
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,270
it feels good.
It just alleviates tension.

1370
01:26:55,271 --> 01:26:57,580
If you could do that every day
for a few minutes, you know,

1371
01:26:57,581 --> 01:27:00,580
that the inversion table,
all those things, you can
keep all that stuff healthy.

1372
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:03,570
Yeah. I, I it, it, it feels good.

1373
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,300
I just don't want to get punched

1374
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:10,600
facing me. I had a bunch in
a place, a lot. I hear you
man. I'm not into it either.

1375
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,000
It's just the brain is
not designed to get right.

1376
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:16,150
It was one of the things that I do like
about Jujitsu more than anything is that

1377
01:27:16,151 --> 01:27:19,960
you can go hard. Right. And you're not,
you know, you're not hitting each other.

1378
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:22,330
There's a big difference.

1379
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:26,200
You can get a full hundred percent
exertion in exercise, workout in without,

1380
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:29,860
you know, risk of hurting each other.
Especially if you go with a good guy.

1381
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:36,010
The guys I work with, our poll and their
fight is way better than mine. So, uh,

1382
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:40,720
they not a train. Yeah. Not going to,
they're not going to jail. So important.

1383
01:27:40,721 --> 01:27:43,480
You know, because I've been, I've
been doing flight stuff for a long,

1384
01:27:43,481 --> 01:27:47,980
long time and I've been
fortunate that there's always,

1385
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:51,830
there was always somebody better
looking out and say, hey, let's work.

1386
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,440
So worked back, you know, just
tweaking, just making those tweaks.

1387
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,660
Yeah. That's what I was going to ask you.
Do you, do you do any ground training?

1388
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:00,650
Do you do any Jiu Jitsu?

1389
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,880
Not Enough. Not Enough. Not Enough.
Nope. Um, and, and like I said,

1390
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:09,110
my coaches are really good, but I
don't do enough of it. I do, uh,

1391
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,570
I don't have a good,
I don't have a good reason.

1392
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,730
And I just said that to him. I just
said, hey guys, I have to do more.

1393
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:20,780
I gotta do more ground stuff. And they're
like, right on. Yeah. Yeah. Get in there,

1394
01:28:20,781 --> 01:28:25,350
man. I mean, it's humbling. Yeah. We
can do to avoid a, do you know, um,

1395
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:31,460
I mean we, I do it, but not,
but not enough. Right? Yeah.

1396
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:36,900
I'm very comfortable on
my feet. Um, uh, my, my,

1397
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:41,630
my level of confidence,
uh, on, um, you know,

1398
01:28:41,631 --> 01:28:46,490
being able to punch somebody's mouth
loose without them even knowing what

1399
01:28:46,491 --> 01:28:51,470
happened is, is pretty. I got, I'm
pretty confident there, you know,

1400
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:54,140
with, with, with, you know,

1401
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,110
the likelihood of who I'm
going to tussle with. Um,

1402
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:03,110
that's the thing though.
Yep. And plus, stop.

1403
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:06,270
I got Moxie,
you know,

1404
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:11,760
I got a lot of attitude and that goes
a long way, you know, having that, uh,

1405
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,380
that could, spa, that attitude.

1406
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:18,750
Sometimes it's equally
important to have that.

1407
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:23,930
I have a thing in my head that says
I could beat anybody at anything.

1408
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:28,630
It doesn't have to be true, but that's
what I hear in my head. Well, the problem,

1409
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:33,220
oh, that is when it's obviously that's
not true. Right? Then you're like, fuck,

1410
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:36,730
now what? And then, uh, then
you get experience experiences.

1411
01:29:36,731 --> 01:29:40,900
So can you get shortly after
you need it? Yeah. Yeah.

1412
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,440
So it's interesting that you
combine those things though,

1413
01:29:44,441 --> 01:29:48,010
that you have this gym or there's
all this martial arts stuff,

1414
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:51,130
the tactical stuff.
What do you do to chill out?

1415
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:54,670
Because it seems like everything
is fucking Coco, coco cow.

1416
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:57,580
Everything is lifting weights,
shooting and pulling, ropes,

1417
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:01,480
shooting and arm dragging and shooting.
Um, what do you do to calm yourself?

1418
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:06,030
I am hobby heavy. Hobby heavy. Well,
you show me your drawing. Very talented.

1419
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:10,890
I, so I draw, um, I burb I
bird watch third watch. Yup.

1420
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:14,320
I bet a birdwatcher since I was
10 years old. Really? Yup. Golf.

1421
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:19,780
I go down this list,
guitar, drums, um, uh,

1422
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:24,550
Cook. Let me see. I got so many
freaking hobbies. It's ridiculous.

1423
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:29,500
And, but the good thing about
most of ms I could go to him and,

1424
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:31,090
um,
and um,

1425
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:34,810
it doesn't take me a lot of
time or energy to invest in it.

1426
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:39,160
A fishing on big time fisherman,
outdoorsman, woodsmen type of thing.

1427
01:30:39,161 --> 01:30:40,120
I love that stuff.

1428
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:45,690
I get into rocky mountains at least once
a year and two like privation training,

1429
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:49,870
you know, just on my own. So like
what do you do when you do that?

1430
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:54,370
This camp out there and live off the
land. We tried it, try it, try to sustain,

1431
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,680
you know, with what I have and
what's available to me. And it also,

1432
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:03,850
yeah. Uh, and it also includes
a orienteering, so you know,

1433
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
one over 24,000 scale
topographical map and,

1434
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:14,280
um, so orienteering and, and
these are wilderness areas,

1435
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:19,150
not like national parks or forest. And
then, uh, try to hunt a killer, eat it.

1436
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:20,770
You know, along the way. Carry,

1437
01:31:20,771 --> 01:31:24,970
I carry enough food so I'm not going to
be miserable, so I'm not going to suffer.

1438
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:28,900
How many days do you do when you're out
there? Well, it, it now that I'm retired,

1439
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:31,780
not four to five anymore,

1440
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:37,960
bringing ruck sack or something like
that. So I pack in, Yup. Whatever.

1441
01:31:37,961 --> 01:31:42,640
A, whenever I need. And you know,
pat king a ruck is a, it's a real,

1442
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:47,650
it's a, it's artwork man. Even if
you've been in the military forever,

1443
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,833
you know,

1444
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:54,580
you just never ever get that
down to a perfect science,

1445
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:59,620
especially a weight cause you got, wait,
you're going to rain, you got a, you know,

1446
01:31:59,621 --> 01:32:01,750
the, the, uh, uh,

1447
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:05,020
the situation may dictate
to strip this and add that.

1448
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:08,230
And then where are you going to put it
and to bring satellite phone or anything.

1449
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:12,590
We do it or you do I bring it?
Yeah, bring one of those. Yep.

1450
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:17,080
You don't want to roll an ankle out
there. Well, plus I usually go to Montana,

1451
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:20,740
like the Bob Marshall, so that's both
the highest concentration of grizzlies.

1452
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:25,630
Lower 48. So you're not on the top of
boogy man or some big Hungary's out there.

1453
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,070
That's a fucking scary
spot. Yeah. Well it's,

1454
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,750
it's always usually pretty good
unless you run into a female. Yeah.

1455
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:35,050
With there corrupts. That's when it
gets super sketchy. I just wrote it.

1456
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,260
I just wrote about that. Um, I write,

1457
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,690
so I write for a
ballistic magazine and um,

1458
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:47,200
combat handguns and I just wrote an
article about that wouldn't ballistic, uh,

1459
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:50,530
about what should be in your
personal survival kit. You know,

1460
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,860
let's say you go on a day fishing
trip in Alaska. What should,

1461
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,810
what do you have in that thing in the
event that you need to go into contingency

1462
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:00,820
planning mode,
that shit hits the fan.

1463
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,940
You got to have something
on you instead of just your,

1464
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:09,330
your Orvis fly rod and a couple of beat
heads yet with the big debate with a

1465
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:13,120
hunter's is should you bring bear
spray or feed you bring a pistol? Yup.

1466
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:18,010
Especially both smart that I need to
anytime bear country, I bring both.

1467
01:33:18,011 --> 01:33:22,210
I got them both on and I've talked to a
lot of grids hunters and I put that in

1468
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:26,470
that article too. It's like guys, you
know, I've done some research here.

1469
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:30,940
Uh, but yeah, so I'll
bring, I'll bring both.

1470
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:36,110
Have you had any encounters when you're
out a pad? Almost every year. Really. Um,

1471
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,580
the closest one 15 yards, man. Yeah.

1472
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:44,170
That was the first time ever up there
too. And I'm smoked. I'm at the end.

1473
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:48,130
This is what I was doing. I started doing
these when we were, when I was active,

1474
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,300
so bringing up unit guys and
this one was 95 miles long.

1475
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:56,470
We walk from um,
uh,

1476
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:00,070
a little spot on the map.
Oh,

1477
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:03,940
Columbia falls south of Columbia
Falls Montana to Lincoln.

1478
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:08,950
The home Ted Kaczynski. The
Unabomber recently. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1479
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:12,400
So walk this stretch and it's
95 miles right north to south.

1480
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:16,990
And you've got across like three
different mountain passes and smoker.

1481
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:21,670
So the s I think it was,
it was the fifth day. Yeah,

1482
01:34:21,671 --> 01:34:26,470
because we had one more Ron, one more rest
overnight. And on the fifth day I had,

1483
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,030
we would walk like lines of drift
and stuff like that, you know? Uh,

1484
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:35,370
and whenever I couldn't see 25
yards up ahead, I would, you know,

1485
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:39,610
clap my hands, make some
racket coming through mark,
you know, that kind of thing.

1486
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,790
Because Griz want nothing to do with you.
Right.

1487
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,850
You get in between their young,

1488
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:51,790
their food source or you
startle them. That's when you
run into trouble. Right. Um,

1489
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:56,650
so I did not want to stand and here I
am, I'm, and I've got six guys with me,

1490
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:59,570
but they're lagging behind.
Uh, and I, you know,

1491
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,600
come through and I look up ahead and
this gigantic male stands up booze.

1492
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:09,950
And the only thing that I could see,
my only reaction was, whoa. I mean,

1493
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,640
I was just blown away.

1494
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,290
15 yards is less distance
than you flew when you crash,

1495
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:17,471
right?
Yeah.

1496
01:35:17,471 --> 01:35:22,320
It flew in the fly in the
air and pass that five yard.

1497
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:26,600
That's right. Yup. Yup. He
took off. Boom. He was gone.

1498
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,390
She was lucky. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Because I mean,

1499
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,360
that's a lot. That's a lot of animal.
Yeah. I tell you when you're standing,

1500
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:39,830
like in the woods in the wild,
15 yards,

1501
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:44,770
1550 yards, and when that thing
stood up, that's all I could say.

1502
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:47,450
That's all. I mean, I had
a gun and bear spray on me.

1503
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:50,960
I went for neither of them
all I could think it was whoa.

1504
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:54,970
And then when he took off, my next
thought was, where's my camera? Oh, Jesus.

1505
01:35:55,970 --> 01:36:00,440
Well that's nature's cleanup crew right
there. Anything that limps falls down,

1506
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:02,570
fucks up. Yup. That's what it's there for.

1507
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:07,160
That's why there's a thousand pounds
of them, man. It needs to camp eating.

1508
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:12,590
It's a, it's a majestic animal. You see
one in the wild, you realize like, wow,

1509
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:15,960
like this is just,
nature has a system. Yup.

1510
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:18,230
They know what they're doing when
they want to get rid of a moose.

1511
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:23,120
They sent one of these motherfuckers
in there. I mean, really?

1512
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:26,570
Yeah. So when you're doing
these, um, these things,

1513
01:36:26,571 --> 01:36:29,870
are you keeping a journal when you doing
these, these trips for you by yourself?

1514
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:34,250
Um,
I usually don't go by myself.

1515
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:36,770
I usually have straphangers and
they're different every year.

1516
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:41,420
It's a lot of times just
like this, you know, a couple
guys talking, saying, aw man,

1517
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:42,254
I like to do that with you.

1518
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,920
We'll just send me an email and
I'll send you the dates. Oh Wow.

1519
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:51,380
Because one is securities and numbers,
right. Especially at Greer's country.

1520
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:55,250
Um, plus I like teaching stuff. So yeah,

1521
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:59,180
I'll have guys who I could teach like
orienteering and you know, field craft,

1522
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:02,850
you know, making a fire with sticks
and kind of that kind of thing and uh,

1523
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:08,060
the right way to maybe to prep
and cook a trout, you know?

1524
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:12,040
Uh, so do you bring a rod with
you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1525
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:16,310
I'm one of them small breakdown
routes. A bring a foe. I, I'll,

1526
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:17,181
I'll bring two of them.

1527
01:37:17,181 --> 01:37:22,181
I'll bring a tell us telescoping
a 10 cholera and day a four piece,

1528
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:27,020
like a five weight Orvis okay.
Because it's fly rod then. Yeah.

1529
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:33,380
For me, that's sustenance cause I'm not
taking a lot of food. Plus I want to fish,

1530
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:36,440
I want it to be time
off and I want to chill.

1531
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,050
I don't want to just work my
ass off when I'm on these.

1532
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,390
So I'm out there ripping lips,

1533
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:45,200
but I'm eating two of them in
the morning and two at night. Uh,

1534
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:47,600
and then it's a lot.
It's a lot of fun.

1535
01:37:47,601 --> 01:37:50,510
I've been doing these things now since 98.

1536
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:53,510
I think that's a great way to
decompress too, right? Yeah.

1537
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:59,040
The places I go to,
one of them is I will lose cell coat,

1538
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:03,250
cell phone coverage in our, before
I hit the end of the dirt road. Oh,

1539
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:08,600
Yup. So, and then you stopped
the call. You were at the
end of the road. Now you're,

1540
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:09,870
you know,
you're already in.

1541
01:38:09,871 --> 01:38:14,871
You're just at the edge of the Wilderness
area deep into a national forest and

1542
01:38:15,871 --> 01:38:19,940
then into the wilderness for, you
know, however many days, miles,

1543
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:25,320
uh, we run another folks in. You're out
there. Very rarely the best. You know,

1544
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,370
I loved walking like under 95
mile one and seeing nobody,

1545
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:33,390
nobody. Yeah. I mean, these
places that are remote,

1546
01:38:33,391 --> 01:38:36,420
the Frank Church and Idaho,
uh,

1547
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:39,690
I walked wind river and uh,
Wyoming

1548
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:45,420
to the Frank Church. I walked
from the town of Salmon to McCall.

1549
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,630
That one's smoked me. How
far is that? W W on a scale.

1550
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:54,810
Things as a crow flies. It's not that
far. I think it's 60 miles or something,

1551
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:57,020
but it's straight up,
straight down.

1552
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:02,100
It's the most horrific and
d just terrifying terrain.

1553
01:39:03,931 --> 01:39:07,030
I mean, especially if
you're, you know, uh,

1554
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:11,280
if your objective is to move from point
a to point B and not just an out and

1555
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:13,020
back, let me see how far it can go. No,

1556
01:39:13,021 --> 01:39:16,240
when you got somebody picking you up at
point B and you have to be there, right?

1557
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,490
Oh man, it is a freaking smoker. Yeah.

1558
01:39:20,491 --> 01:39:21,750
I've never been in the Frank Church.

1559
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:25,530
My friend Ryan Callahan was living up
there for a long time and it's cool.

1560
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:29,730
He says it's amazing up there.
It's also so it's so remote,

1561
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:34,800
but yet it's so close to Boise.
Yeah. That far, right? Yeah. Right.

1562
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,990
Yeah. The grand scale of things, it's not,
it's not that far. Right. But there's,

1563
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,930
when you have these wilderness
areas, like uh, I dunno,

1564
01:39:42,931 --> 01:39:46,410
let's say it's 500 million square
acres or whatever it is, you know,

1565
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:51,770
that's also encompassed by
national parks and stuff.

1566
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:54,001
And you know,

1567
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:58,170
national parks will have dirt roads and
I mean they'll have little scatterings

1568
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:01,070
of population here and there,
but those wilderness series,

1569
01:40:01,071 --> 01:40:03,580
there's nothing in those just animal.

1570
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:07,690
There's no dirt roads and it's
such a complete ecosystem to me.

1571
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:11,580
You have to have everything from wolves,
the grizzlies to mule deer to elk.

1572
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:16,230
It's all living up in there.
And they are cool.

1573
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:20,940
I mean, I love doing those two
because you have to think there isn't,

1574
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,850
there is an element of danger
here that that can kill me.

1575
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,950
And it's not just a big hungry,

1576
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:29,520
you could get cut

1577
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,700
out there because nobody's coming to
get you. Even if you got that beacon,

1578
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:41,040
you know, forest service and stuff,
they're probably busy servicing, you know,

1579
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:44,910
grandma broke her leg trying to take a
picture of a bison in his national park

1580
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:50,880
coming into that national,
that wilderness area, you know,

1581
01:40:50,881 --> 01:40:54,610
there's no a Chelsea's there and
stuff like that. Right. So man,

1582
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:59,050
I love that, that element of danger,
especially since I retired. You know, you,

1583
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:03,830
I want to be cold, tired, hungry,
and maybe a little scared. Um,

1584
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,680
and I want that several times a year cause
uh, yeah, it's, you know, it's primal,

1585
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:13,950
right?
And I think most guys need that guy.

1586
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:18,730
He's a yeah, no, I think so too.
Dude, you live in a fun life, man.

1587
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:22,420
Yeah, I enjoy, I enjoy following
it. Right on. I appreciate it.

1588
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:26,830
I appreciate you coming on, man. I
really do do tell people one more time.
