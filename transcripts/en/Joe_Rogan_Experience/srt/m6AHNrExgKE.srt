1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,790
The general good experience,

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,550
it was a place in Australia and the,
the property owners like the ranch has

3
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:10,610
called me up and they said you need to
come out and shoot some of the boxes.

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:14,030
Like they'd devastating our lambs and
uh,

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,690
I end up going out there and when I was
driving in with a full drive at night

6
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:20,900
with the high beams on,
I seen this massive big black and white

7
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:24,230
ball walking between the flock of sheep
with a laminates mouth.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,890
It was these pig and it got a taste for
meat and it happens all the time.

9
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,500
Like so a big bore,
especially a mature animal,

10
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:33,020
will get a taste for meat in harsh
conditions.

11
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:37,310
And now just stick the meat after that.
And ended up catching up with these pig

12
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:40,460
the next morning and shot it with a bow.
It actually attacked me.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
The first shot wasn't perfect and it
charged me and I ended up stabbing it to

14
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:44,834
death.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,070
I was on a slope like this on the
mountain cheese and it was really a

16
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:53,560
battle like high end up hooking the ball
out of my hand because when he charged

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,950
me I'll put an Arrow and shot and just
went down one side and hit one lung and

18
00:00:57,951 --> 00:01:02,690
it just infuriated this bowl and he was
on me and when I was sending him off

19
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:05,630
with the bow is tasked,
went into the bottom of the bow or the

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,710
cam or something like that and rip the
bow out of my hand and I ended up

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,400
getting a knife off me and I ended up
stabbing this pig was electronic.

22
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:15,170
Run me over.
Oh Shit.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,220
How big was it?
It was a big boys like big mountain.

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,560
It made eight and bullet like this and
like how many pounds,

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,660
you know,
a fucking big 10.

26
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:27,540
Many pounds.
Probably not 300 hour mountain bullshit.

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,820
Get real solid.
Yeah,

28
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,410
probably $200.
Something like that.

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,270
And uh,
anyway,

30
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:37,130
I ended up stabbing this thing to death
and when I ended up cutting it open,

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,310
it's whole insides,
like it's whole stomach was like lambs

32
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:41,360
hawks,
like the feet,

33
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,440
the bottom of the feet where they can't
swallow and skulls and just like little

34
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:49,880
bits of wool and stuff like that.
He'd just been going around and just

35
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:54,350
picking these lambs often killing them
and it's a really known occurrence in

36
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,210
Australia and how that if things get
hard,

37
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,150
I would just go just because they,
they just absolutely ruthless.

38
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:02,640
I would just walk right between the
sheep and just fucking grab a land walk

39
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,930
off of chewed up and Ada.

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,710
Yeah.
And how much comes out in the fucking

41
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,620
forest,
Bro.

42
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,690
That's where the next note,
one or swamp thing happened while I was

43
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:13,540
thinking this,
once they found out that in some plants

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,570
some plants contain DNA from salmon
because the salmon were used as

45
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,910
fertilizer by the plant as it
decomposed.

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,100
It got into the actual plant itself.
And you can actually somehow or another

47
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,460
through some sort of scientific process
that I'm too stupid to understand.

48
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,570
They can actually detect salmon in the
actual plant itself.

49
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,330
We're close.
So if you were whacking off on that tree

50
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,790
and that tree,
it's everyday.

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,900
That's your spot.
You went down to that titty tree and

52
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,980
whacked off on the roots and then like
after a while you did an analysis and

53
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:50,920
you found your dna in the tree itself.
Imagine.

54
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,821
Oh,
it'd be great,

55
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,560
man.
If it maintains the information of

56
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:54,760
everything that whacked off on it.

57
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,450
You have a little son made out of wood
one day mom,

58
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,190
your dad.
A kid in our town one time.

59
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,620
Does he go,
I made a son a wooden shirt that I tell

60
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,310
you that a wooden.
Sure.

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah.
He made his son a shirt out of plywood

62
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,920
for Christmas.
What do you want a kid to wear it?

63
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,890
Oh,
Yay.

64
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,180
Did.
And I remember I was um,

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,980
wait a minute.
Is it a stiff shirt or is it you make it

66
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,520
like little itty bitty tiny pieces of
plywood and weave it all together?

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,660
Oh No,
I was pretty stiff and the dad was a um,

68
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,160
like an Elvis impersonator,
you know?

69
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,140
But Dad was an Elvis impersonator at a
casino or did he do it at carnivals this

70
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,470
locally?
Um,

71
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,760
but we didn't even meet him that.
No,

72
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,080
no money really.
I think he's probably an alcoholic,

73
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,700
but he had a,
he had four kids and one of them he

74
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,360
made.

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,600
I was going walking home one night and I
heard them in the garage and he's making

76
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,210
like a son,
like a,

77
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,220
like a for Christmas.
Like a wooden shirt,

78
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,360
like a,
you know.

79
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,430
There you go.
Uh,

80
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,950
not as nice.
That one is nice.

81
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,450
Wouldn't shirt?
Yeah.

82
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,490
Can you get sore?
Oh,

83
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,150
but that's a.
like a sculpture.

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,470
Yeah.
That's nice.

85
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,990
Can you just get one more?
That's like a,

86
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,060
like if you go over someone's house and
they have a wooden shirt on a hanger,

87
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,640
like and they think that's cute.
Just leave.

88
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,170
Now people are assholes now.
This kid needed it because people used

89
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:18,030
to this kid.
Is that salmon?

90
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,560
Yeah,
it's a framed wouldn't shirt.

91
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,350
It looks like we used to beat him up
because it was wooden shirt now people

92
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,520
used to beat him up anyway on the bus.
Well the wouldn't share.

93
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:29,020
It would protect you from a lot of shots
and it helped and it helped.

94
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,940
He didn't wear that,
wouldn't.

95
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,020
Sure.
You better shut the fuck.

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,210
I swear to God.
He did not walking around with wood over

97
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,800
his body like that.
Not Today.

98
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,090
That would be.
Yeah.

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,840
This was your pads inside of it looked
heavy.

100
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,750
Fuck.
No,

101
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,390
dude.
I think his dad is estee lauder ladies

102
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,020
place,
so to play devil's advocate here so that

103
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,230
that stuff that comes in those dick
pills and you can get from other

104
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,200
steroids,
but it happens to be in those days.

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,650
You certainly can.
Yes,

106
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,960
but.
But that is one narrative that you took

107
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,120
clear that you could say,
well it's in these dick pills.

108
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,430
I'm not saying you can't do that.
That's true,

109
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,460
but it's in such a small amount in his
body and it wasn't in his body before

110
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,400
and it wasn't in his body after which
showed that it was only in his body and

111
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:12,290
extremely small amounts for a small
window amount,

112
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,320
but a small window of time.

113
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,290
So it's not like he had it.
It's not even like this stuff,

114
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,250
which is a metabolite which is showing a
response to the body,

115
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,950
the body responding to the steroids.
And let me ask this,

116
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:24,820
Joe.
Okay.

117
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,850
Why does no other fighter have any Pico
Pico grant that this pulsating effect

118
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,390
really?
Well,

119
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:34,350
that's not true.
I mean other tested.

120
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,170
Frank Mir tested positive for something
two years.

121
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,840
Tom Law,
our tests,

122
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,870
but Frank Mir didn't go through the same
steps that Jon Jones did.

123
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:48,991
He didn't provide them with A.
I forget what the exact there was.

124
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,050
There was something that John did also
that lowered his sentencing reform it.

125
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,770
Yes.
It was cooperating with Usada yeah.

126
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,130
Or,
or agreeing to cooperate with Usada.

127
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,140
Yeah.
That then were just cool with that.

128
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,420
Listen,
I don't even know what that means.

129
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
I don't either.
But let me ask you this.

130
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,790
If I agreed to Usada to be an informant,
snitches get stitches.

131
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,040
Correct.
Unless you're John,

132
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,450
that no one can beat you up,
so you're fine.

133
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,830
But the thing is,
is

134
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,540
the only way I can inform you is if
something that have that,

135
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,280
um,
knowing that I know of,

136
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,640
I can inform you of just stuff that's
like,

137
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:36,050
you lay shit.
That was what I asked Novitsky I was

138
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:37,700
like,
if you didn't do anything wrong,

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,700
like,
and what is he going to offer?

140
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,160
Because if,
unless he took something,

141
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,450
unless you know what you're doing.
Like if I'm an informant for the FBI or

142
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:50,810
for the feds for cocaine,
I know my cocaine,

143
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,160
right?
We're not going to get joe blow.

144
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,250
That makes my fucking express so we can
get the guy who knows the ins and outs

145
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,700
of cocaine.
That's again,

146
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,261
that's,
I'm like,

147
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,270
all right,
cool.

148
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,290
Before they have a conversation with him
and he says he can provide them with

149
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,270
information with how guys are getting
away with passing truck to.

150
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,250
And how would you know about that?
Unless you're in on that?

151
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,390
No,
I don't either.

152
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:14,690
I'm just saying again,
to me all of this is a little too much

153
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,930
of a coincidence that the best fighter
on the planet earth has these issues.

154
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,050
The best fight in the planet earth also
ran away from a hit and run.

155
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:23,030
Smash into a girl,
broke her arm.

156
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,090
He also drove his car into a tree.
He's a reckless person who takes a lot

157
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:32,210
of chances and he does some,
at least in the past,

158
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,340
has done some things that are not very
wise.

159
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,330
This could fall under that.
It could fall in correct.

160
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,240
Or I began to play devil's advocate.
I'm not accusing them of anything.

161
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,870
Let's play devil's advocate or a guy who
was that Lucy goosey outside the

162
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:47,840
octagon,
might've taken some performance

163
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,990
enhancing things because that would be
the similar traits.

164
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,890
I,
I think that,

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,130
look,
there's certain things that this

166
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,210
administration is doing foreign policy
wise that I think are good.

167
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,780
It makes sense.
There are other things that I think you

168
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,820
just leave you scratching your head.
Um,

169
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,710
but that's like every administration.
I guess my point is we've gotten away

170
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:11,850
from that ability,
right?

171
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:13,830
I have conversations.
I go out to dinner with folks that,

172
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,821
you know,
on the,

173
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:16,560
on the,
on the hard left.

174
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,480
And when you talk to them,
they fully believe,

175
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,990
fully believe that president trump is a
Russian puppet,

176
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,160
a winning asset of Putin who is just
doing Putin's bidding.

177
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,360
And they honestly honestly believe that
and nothing is going to shift them off

178
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:36,490
that position.
When you have a,

179
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,550
you know,
that sort of frame of reference,

180
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,790
you don't have the ability to look at
anything rationally and say,

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,451
yeah,
okay,

182
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:45,300
I like this policy related to China.

183
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,780
It's about time we call them out and say
that you obviously have not been a fair

184
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:50,880
trading partner.
That's something that every

185
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:53,460
administration has agreed to but has
never done anything about.

186
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,550
So you would think that everybody will
be to say makes sense.

187
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,443
Yeah,
I like it.

188
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,460
Everybody should be able to say the
immigration system here in the states is

189
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,260
somewhat dysfunctional.
It needs fixing.

190
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,710
Everybody's talked about that and yet
they can't do it because they've got

191
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,660
this,
this mindset that,

192
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,260
that that prevents them from having any
sort of conversation,

193
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,070
any sort of rational discussion that
could lead to some compromise that could

194
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,250
then advance the ball and make the
government more functional.

195
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,323
So

196
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,390
I wasn't even ready for that one.
Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's

197
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,190
animated.
It's on youtube now.

198
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,660
Have you and him coming over your house
in a limousine and us.

199
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,770
It was a lion or a tiger.
Tiger.

200
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,860
Tiger dude.
It is one of the craziest fucking

201
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,450
stories.
I always win.

202
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,630
So for people that don't know,
I got to hang out with you at one of my

203
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,960
shows one time and it was a great.
I had the best time talking about

204
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,660
everything.
What made you think you could get a

205
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,700
tiger?
Like how did that even happen?

206
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,530
Hey,
I'm in.

207
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,440
Um,
I'm.

208
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,663
So,
I'm,

209
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,490
I'm in prison at the time,
so I'm in prison.

210
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,530
I'm talking to my car dealer at the time
and he has,

211
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:04,364
uh,
he has,

212
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,140
um,
caused the,

213
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,560
belonged to a friend of mine that's both
a friend of ours and he's discussing the

214
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:13,370
feet other than paying for these cars.
I'm a fellow cars to someone and get

215
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:14,540
some horses and stuff.
I said,

216
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,550
well,
you can get a hold of

217
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,370
because I had a lot of carbs after I
probably get them off.

218
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,970
You get,
you get cool.

219
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:24,320
Good Lions,
tigers.

220
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:27,140
I know this guy got exactly what you do.
Can you give me some tigers?

221
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,380
Yeah.
The Guy told me and the guy from.

222
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,850
Imagine how cool that bad because I had
a bunch of friends because magnet man,

223
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:35,900
he'd be in the aftermarket for Rami.
You haven't tiger right next to you.

224
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,340
Wow.
Would be cool.

225
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,510
Right after he had gave me some cousins,
man when I came home I had those cups

226
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,630
right there waiting for me.
So you raise them as cups because that's

227
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:49,330
how.
That's how you work.

228
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,370
Because I would see footage of you like
fucking smacking them around and jumping

229
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:56,070
on one of your tires and I was like,
Holy Shit.

230
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,350
And I had an incident were bathed that
their mother,

231
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,150
their mother,
their babies.

232
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,090
Now it never gets.
This is a crazy picture.

233
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:05,640
You and your underwear with a tiger on
chain.

234
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,340
That is.
That is one of the.

235
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,800
That's you at peak?
Crazy.

236
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,280
Yeah.
And thing.

237
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,670
Yeah.
Going through my mind.

238
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,760
What made me think about my friends and
Mike,

239
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,980
you can get from from the animals and I
think really

240
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,780
going to get from everybody.
Does it though.

241
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,630
Those are one of the things about a with
what's his face from narcos?

242
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,290
Pablo Escobar last.
He got like a fucking

243
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,620
crazy.
Do they all do it.

244
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,360
Once you get like that rich,
you're like,

245
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,690
just get some animals,
animals,

246
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,780
animals.
So people in with the Lions and tigers.

247
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,910
Real common thing that is super rich.
People getting shit.

248
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,030
Jacqueline huddlestone.
That's right.

249
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,200
Michael Jackson.
Language accent.

250
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,761
Everything.
Yeah.

251
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:02,500
They had like a zoo in his backyard.
He had weird shit.

252
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,750
Like weird birds.
Yeah.

253
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,370
I don't think it may be at a monkey or
something.

254
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,330
He did have weird shit.
Nothing dangerous day before the playboy

255
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,990
mansion.
This is at the end of his career.

256
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:15,550
That was like whoa.
The thing years ago thumping and it was

257
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,420
pretty awesome.
