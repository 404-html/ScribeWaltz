1
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,641
Boom,
and we're live.

2
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:12,720
How are you doing?
Are Our.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,350
A lot of stuff is going on

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,230
stuff.
Alana,

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,063
since your settlement.
Jamie and I were hoping that you would 

6
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:19,320
come in with one of those Paul Wall 
grills,

7
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,110
like diamonds on it and maybe some furs.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,790
Yeah,
up in a cadillac.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,510
Unfortunately it it's enough money to 
make a difference,

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,344
but it's not enough money to do no 
longer have to think about such things 

11
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,564
so you can temporarily ball though if 
you were irresponsible and you didn't 

12
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,010
have a family.
If I didn't have a family,

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,580
you get crazy for a couple of months.
As it happens.

14
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:46,110
It gives us a room to think about how to
replace our incomes.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,930
We have about two years at our current 
rate of.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,240
Of burning to keep the family.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,600
Yeah.
People just.

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,010
So this is a standalone podcast so 
people can kind of.

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,890
What you need to do,
if you're really interested in this,

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,750
it really interested is google,
Bret Weinstein and you will get the full

21
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:04,584
story from beginning to end with 
evergreen state college where I'll just 

22
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:09,924
give you the short version of it.
There was a bunch of what you would 

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,840
kindly call social active people,
social justice warriors,

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,180
people who there's a movement going on 
in this country and it's very aggressive

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,890
and one of the things that they wanted 
to do is they wanted to have a day where

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,650
a,
all white people stayed home.

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,933
You thought that was racist.
They thought you were racist for saying 

28
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,010
that was racist.
And um,

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,930
they decided to literally take over the 
college for a short period of time.

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,530
The dust settled,
you just got a big fat settlement,

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,810
you're out of there.
And so,

32
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:49,644
uh,
and then the woman who was kind of at 

33
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,624
the head of it,
she got a nice little chunk of change 

34
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,600
to,
which I thought was quite odd.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,250
College settled with her,
even though it was quite clear,

36
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,084
she had no legal case.
So there's a bit of a mystery about why 

37
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,743
they would have paid her to resign,
when in fact they could have just stood 

38
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:07,160
their ground.

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,993
She could have probably become the 
president of the college if she wanted 

40
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:10,544
to.
The way that guy had responded to the 

41
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,484
students when they told him to put his 
hands down because he was being 

42
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,250
threatening,
and then he put his hands up.

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,840
He's talking them and using hand 
gestures and they're like,

44
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:21,674
put your hands down,
you're threatening us with 

45
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,050
microaggressions,
puts his hands down.

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,913
They all started laughing,
which just tells you everything about 

47
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:32,410
what their intent was,
what was really going on there and.

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,910
But after I saw that,
I'm like,

49
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,963
she could have been the president.
They should've just had herbie 

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,630
president.
The whole things.

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,100
It was a kangaroo court was mockery

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,030
thing was absurd.
I will say I've.

53
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,923
It's very hard to get the story right in
any sort of short synopsis and so for 

54
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:50,110
anybody who really wants,
it's not even complete,

55
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,973
but heather and I,
my wife Heather was also a professor at 

56
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:53,794
evergreen and we wrote a more complete 
version of the story that people to see 

57
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:03,700
how the internal politics of the college
played out into what they ultimately saw

58
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,534
on youtube.
So that's in the Washington examiner a 

59
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,780
last Tuesday.
I read that and it's

60
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,410
deeply disturbing.
It's,

61
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:14,244
but it's not.
If you've been paying attention and you 

62
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:20,490
know you and I and Jordan Peterson and 
boy,

63
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,490
a bunch of people have tried to figure 
out what's going on today,

64
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,623
like why has this movement become so 
aggressive and so not just aggressive 

65
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,034
but observed not.
It's not logical like the way they're 

66
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:35,784
approaching things is from this very 
strange entitled and just oddly 

67
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,570
fanatical way.

68
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,213
You want to be careful not to mix what 
they say with what they're actually up 

69
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:50,940
to because what they say is very 
confusing.

70
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,803
If it can't be parsed logically,
there's so many contradictions so close 

71
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:56,304
to the surface that one has the sense 
that they are deeply confused and some 

72
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:00,294
of them are,
but there is also a strategic movement 

73
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:04,044
under the surface which we can't listen 
into directly and it is more 

74
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,270
sophisticated than we think.
In other words,

75
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:10,104
it is managing to wield power in spite 
of the fact that it's explanation for 

76
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,620
why it is entitled to wield power 
doesn't make any sense.

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,340
What do you think the underlying 
motivation is like?

78
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:22,170
What is their or their.
At least their underlying

79
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,043
plan?
I would say we have to be careful there 

80
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:26,644
are a lot of people who go along with it
who I would argue are tools of the 

81
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:33,490
movement and they are doing it's bidding
without understanding the objective,

82
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,700
but the prime movers are quite clearly 
interested in taking power.

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,383
They want power,
they have a superficial rationalization 

84
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,851
for why they are entitled to power and 
they are wielding weaponized stigma as a

85
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:48,934
mechanism for gaining.
So you said that Nyeema could have 

86
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,180
become the president of the college.
I don't know whether she could have.

87
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:58,414
It would have been a very unusual path,
but I do know that for more than a year 

88
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,210
I watched people unable to resist 
anything.

89
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,044
She said.
Even people who knew better would in 

90
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,714
faculty meetings,
they would reflectively thank her for 

91
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,890
anything she said no matter how absurd 
it was.

92
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,710
And that was clearly a sort of,
you know,

93
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,970
as the equivalent of a wolves bearing 
their juggler was don't hurt me.

94
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,350
I'm with you.
Don't hurt me.

95
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:28,351
And so that kind of power is something 
that a person who is cynical enough to,

96
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,383
uh,
to wield stigma to get it might cover 

97
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,730
it.
And so anyway,

98
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:37,564
I think there's a small number of people
who really do know what they're doing 

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,713
and their point is we can wipe many of 
the obstacles to our having power off 

100
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:51,100
the map by throwing accusations at them 
that they cannot resist.

101
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah.
The big accusation is racism.

102
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,520
That that's always the big one.
That's one you never want to have thrown

103
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,354
your way if you are deemed a racist.
It's like it's akin to being deemed a 

104
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,530
rapist,
even if it's a false charge.

105
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
Like,
boy,

106
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,080
most people are going to hear the first 
statement before they ever look into the

107
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,003
possibility that you'd been exonerated.
It's you being called a racist is a 

108
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,010
very,
very dangerous thing in today's society.

109
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,610
It's a very dangerous thing.
I do think it's important that we not do

110
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:29,480
their bidding by inflating that danger 
beyond what it actually is.

111
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,373
So I do,
we will never know for sure what the 

112
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,180
trajectory would have been absent what 
happened at Evergreen.

113
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:40,181
But I do think standing up to the mom at
Evergreen and just saying,

114
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,841
frankly,
no,

115
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm not a racist.
You're asking really important

116
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,870
for people that don't know you.
You are a very progressive guy.

117
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,180
You're.
You're very left wing,

118
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,740
very left leaning.
You're.

119
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,910
You're not in any way,
shape or form a conservative and so this

120
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,910
like this is,
this is the left eating itself.

121
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,163
It is the left eating itself,
but I was also in the lucky position of 

122
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,444
being able to imagine what was going to 
happen when that accusation broke and 

123
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:11,944
knowing that there were so many people 
who knew that that couldn't possibly be 

124
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,770
right about me,
that I was going to survive it,

125
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,604
and it's not as if there aren't huge 
numbers of people who still to this day 

126
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:22,864
apparently believe I'm a racist,
in spite of the fact that nothing has 

127
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,194
emerged in all of the time with all of 
the incentive for somebody to bring 

128
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,830
something forward that would suggest 
that I have an issue with race somewhere

129
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:33,664
in my history.
It never emerged and so people do need 

130
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:40,951
to understand that it is possible to 
survive that accusation.

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,570
Well,
especially with your background though,

132
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,460
people don't know your background.
Was it at Yale that you had penn,

133
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,020
Penn to tell that story?

134
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,981
Sure,
sure.

135
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,930
I'll.
I'll do the quick and dirty version.

136
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,350
I'm cliff notes.
I was a freshman at Penn.

137
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,173
A friend of mine was rushing a 
fraternity and the fraternity was 

138
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,014
holding what they call it,
a mystery event and I wasn't rushing a 

139
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,010
fraternity.
I wAsn't interested,

140
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,993
but he convinced me that I didn't have 
anything to do that night and that I 

141
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,084
should go with him and I did,
and after some relatively standard 

142
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,044
fraternity shenanigans,
the event turned into one in which the 

143
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,084
fraternity had hired prostitutes,
pro black prostitutes from the local 

144
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:30,944
environment and the situation.
Penn is in a pretty rough neighborhood 

145
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,880
and this was a pretty wealthy jewish 
frat,

146
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:39,490
and so there was,
you know,

147
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,670
something a pretty unsettling about a 
wealthy jewish frat,

148
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,504
hiring black prostitutes from the local 
neighborhood to engage in what started 

149
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:50,384
out to be a strip tease 'em.
As this thing began to unfold and I 

150
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,830
realized I didn't have any interest in 
being part of this event,

151
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:59,160
I made one of the bigger mistakes of my 
life and I left the event,

152
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,610
but when my friend and other members of 
the fraternity rolled into the dorm that

153
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:05,454
night and told me what happened,
I was absolutely appalled because what 

154
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:13,210
had happened was the fraternity had 
enacted a,

155
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,333
a,
a mock rape of these prostitutes using 

156
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,640
cucumbers and ketchup and,
um,

157
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,440
the idea that there was anything 
acceptable about a,

158
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,723
you know,
an organization that had special 

159
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:30,840
privileges on the campus behaving this 
way.

160
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,810
I couldn't get past it.
And so anyway,

161
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:37,050
I went to the paper and various things 
unfolded.

162
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:37,884
the paper botched the story and made it 
look like I was troubled by the fact 

163
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:43,884
that there were strippers rather than 
troubled by what actually had ended up 

164
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:46,614
happening.
And,

165
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,110
uh,
I ended up writing an editorial for the,

166
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,570
for the paper and all hell broke loose.
Um,

167
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,490
there,
you know,

168
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,323
I got death threats.
the police started tracking phone 

169
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,140
numbers on my phone to see who was 
threatening me.

170
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,330
Ultimately,
there was a trial of the fraternity,

171
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:05,970
the college did not want to put the 
fraternity on trial,

172
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,970
but ultimately public pressure forced 
them to do it.

173
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,763
I testified at the trial,
although since I hadn't seen the thing 

174
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,370
directly,
what I could say was limited,

175
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:19,170
but while I was in the witness room with
the other witnesses,

176
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,530
people who had rushed the fraternity but
had not pledged it,

177
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,510
uh,
the fraternity brothers,

178
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:25,344
including,
I believe the president came in to the 

179
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:29,970
witness room and started bullyIng these 
witnesses and coaching them on what they

180
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,840
should say in front of this,
uh,

181
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,750
this university panel.

182
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,303
Anyway,
ultimately the university was the 

183
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,110
university through the frat off campus 
for a year,

184
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,930
forbid them from pledging a class.
Um,

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,073
and,
uh,

186
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,820
anyway,
there's a lot more to the story.

187
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:52,460
I got an award from the national 
organization for women actually for a,

188
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,050
I've,
I forgot their terminology,

189
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,880
but for basically for standing up,
for,

190
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,840
for women who needed to be defended or 
something like that.

191
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,703
You,
you said you've made the biggest 

192
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,140
mistake,
one of the biggest mistakes of your life

193
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:07,860
by leaving mean meaning that if you were
there you could have probably stopped it

194
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:10,930
or you could at least have known exactly
what was going on there.

195
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,813
No way I could've stopped it,
but I left because I didn't want to be 

196
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,503
party to this event,
but sometime I think journalists know 

197
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:21,834
this.
I was a freshman in college so I didn't 

198
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,224
know it yet,
but journalists understand that 

199
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:31,221
sometimes something horrifying happens 
and the job that you are best positioned

200
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:33,444
to do is documenting it so that the 
world can understand how such things 

201
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,220
occur and do something about it and if I
had understood that that was probably my

202
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,054
highest and best use at that moment,
I would have stuck around and paid 

203
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:49,710
attention to what had happened rather 
than having to go through convincing the

204
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:52,500
world that something had happened,
which I had not directly seen.

205
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,323
Yeah,
I mean how could you have known there's 

206
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:56,584
no.
I don't think it should be hard on 

207
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,810
yourself at all.
You're 18,

208
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,681
right?
Exactly.

209
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,140
How could you have known?
How could you have known,

210
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,273
even if you were 30,
how could you have known what was going 

211
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,124
to happen?
It looked like prostitutes and you're 

212
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:07,440
like,
eh,

213
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,750
I don't want to be here.
See ya.

214
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,993
Exactly.
You didn't know there was going to be a 

215
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,250
mock rape.
Right?

216
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,470
I couldn't have known,
but in any case,

217
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:15,910
in retrospect,
it was a mistake.

218
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,853
It's ah,
it's so crazy that they let groups of 

219
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:22,780
kIds live in a house together and get 
hammered when they don't even have their

220
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:25,870
frontal cortex develop yet manage all 
living together,

221
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,200
feeding off of each other.
you have mob mentality.

222
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,530
All this diffusion of responsibility 
because you have a large group of people

223
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:35,650
that's also like you and everybody's so 
bananas that,

224
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,610
that is few incidents happen as they do.

225
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,893
I mean,
you would think that those things would 

226
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,800
just be chaos the moment you opened up 
the door to every frat house.

227
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,813
Yeah,
and you know there's more chaos than we 

228
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:48,820
know because a lot of what takes place 
we don't,

229
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,673
we don't fInd out about.
But it's a shame because one could take 

230
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:56,320
the thing that drives people into those 
organizations.

231
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,183
And one could use it to power something 
that was useful and interesting and you 

232
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:01,834
know,
really was deeply enriching and I know 

233
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,020
how much flack am I going to take for 
giving the fraternity system a hard tIme

234
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,913
on your podcast.
But plenty of people will tell me how 

235
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,290
enriching their fraternity experience 
was.

236
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,124
And you know,
even at penn there were a couple 

237
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,010
fraternities that were,
I was,

238
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,703
as you can imagine,
hated throughout the fraternity system 

239
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,063
at penn after I had come forward.
But there were two fraternities that 

240
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,220
actually didn't hate me and we're 
welcoming even in that climate.

241
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,070
So I don't want to portray them as a 
monolith there or not.

242
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:33,904
But um,
but it does seem like a wasted 

243
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,024
opportunity that,
that kind of energy that goes into 

244
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,670
fraternity life could be directed to 
something really amazing.

245
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,560
And it's a shame that it doesn't happen 
more often.

246
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,663
Well,
I'm sure there's a lot of great 

247
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:46,864
comradery and it's probably a lot of fun
to go through that experience together 

248
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:49,954
with people that are your same age and 
you're actually living in a house 

249
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,860
together,
but just manage probably awesome fucking

250
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:56,380
adults in that room.
Something like that.

251
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,200
It seems like it just seems like just to
limit your liability.

252
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,790
Yep.
Right.

253
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,470
Without the 35 year olds running around 
and going,

254
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,930
hey,
what are you doing over there?

255
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,140
My fire won't be able to put that out.
Adult like that one on fire,

256
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,200
just,
I dunno.

257
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,390
Just crazy.

258
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,010
So that's your,
your situation.

259
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:25,780
So anybody that would think of you as a 
conservative or a racist,

260
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,614
it's like,
it's clearly the evidence points to the 

261
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:29,680
contrary.
Well,

262
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,430
I,
I,

263
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,760
you know,
this issue of conservatism is one that I

264
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:34,594
would like to also get right.
and I'm not sure I ever say this in a 

265
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:37,930
way that people know what I'm talking 
about,

266
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:40,420
but I'm,
I'm very progressive,

267
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,350
but I'm very progressive because I live 
in a world that's really screwed up.

268
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,303
And so the idea that we have to make 
some progress seems just transparently 

269
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,670
correct me.
um,

270
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,980
I would like to live in a world that

271
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,813
is so well structured that I could be a 
conservative and I don't mean a 

272
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,860
conservative in the sense that the 
ideological sense,

273
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:58,694
I mean I would like to be in a world 
where tinkering with it stood a better 

274
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,640
chance of making it worse,
um,

275
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,220
and was unnecessary and so that,
that would,

276
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,113
that would turn me into a conservative 
because it would be the right thing to 

277
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:11,564
be in a proper analysis would tell you 
this is the time to conserve the 

278
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,320
structure rather than change it.
But in this world,

279
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,670
yeah,
it turns out I'm a,

280
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,553
I'm a progressive.
And the events that people keep telling 

281
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,170
me that they were sure I'm now at a 
closet conservative,

282
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:30,410
that the,
what I faced must have turned me against

283
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:32,870
the left.
And that's not at all what happened.

284
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,370
Yeah,
I agree with you.

285
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:37,040
I've,
I've faced out myself that people say,

286
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,883
oh,
you're going to turn more conservative 

287
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,070
with all this.

288
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,903
No,
I'm just more resentful of these fake 

289
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,980
progressive movement that,
like you said,

290
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:47,570
has ulterior motives.
There's,

291
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,330
there's more to it.
It's and it's not.

292
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,493
It's not accurate.
Like the portrayals of humans in in 

293
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,040
these movements are not accurate.
It's not.

294
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,303
I don't think it's healthy.
I don't think it's normal and I think 

295
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:02,414
there's a lot of.
The game of capitalism is a very 

296
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:09,980
confusing one and there's certainly 
certainly some very evil aspects to it.

297
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:10,814
Right,
but the idea that the answer is marxism 

298
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,950
seems to me to be just as just as poorly
thought out it.

299
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,903
It's,
it's at least as poorly thought out 

300
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,680
marxism.
The flaw is more obvious.

301
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,900
I think the flaw is what we in biology 
would call group selection.

302
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,080
The belief that if we just all row in 
the same direction,

303
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,100
we'll get somewhere.
Marvelous,

304
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,943
and that's true,
that if we did all row in the same 

305
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:40,844
direction we would,
but there's a very good game theoretic 

306
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,120
reason that that can't be.

307
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,333
Yeah.
That as soon as you have everybody 

308
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:47,174
rowing in the same direction,
then the wind goes to the person who 

309
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:50,564
figures out how not to row and gets the 
benefit of everybody else's rowing in 

310
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,014
that direction while they sweep in the 
prophets and so that tears apart 

311
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,350
anything structured.
The way communism is structured.

312
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,690
Yeah,
that's conveniently ignored.

313
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,553
I think I really have always believed 
that competition is good and it's 

314
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:10,100
because I've been involved in 
competition my whole life and I think it

315
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,220
helps you understand yourself.
You're competing against other people,

316
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,054
but ultimately you're really competing 
against yourself because you're trying 

317
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:21,260
to better yourself and I believe that 
that's the argument for getting children

318
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:25,610
involved in athletics or games or 
something that's very difficult to do.

319
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,444
Whether it's chess or pool or something.
I think things that are hard to do are 

320
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:31,094
good for you.
Competing is good for you because it 

321
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:37,040
teaches you about focus and discipline 
and understanding that there is.

322
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,730
You can reap the rewards of hard work 
and you know,

323
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:44,660
obviously this can get distorted and you
can get these,

324
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,720
you know,
billionaire oligarchs who,

325
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,130
you know,
control vast amounts,

326
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,190
wealth and then they have

327
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,023
their family and everyone inherits it 
and you have these fucking mutants that 

328
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:56,430
are all inbred and they're all in the 
same bloodline mean that's,

329
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,720
that's history,
right?

330
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,170
I mean that has taken place,
but I think that

331
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,930
we should work very hard for equality of
opportunity.

332
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,650
I think equality of oPportunity give 
everybody a chance to play a game.

333
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,710
Everybody a chance to get into something
and,

334
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,460
and try to better themselves with some 
endeavor and summit.

335
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,830
But whenever I hear equality of outcome,
that's when I put my foot down.

336
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm like,
that doesn't it?

337
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,533
That's not real.
You can't say that because some people 

338
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,790
work harder and if you have true 
equality,

339
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,010
you're never going to have equality of 
outcome.

340
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,820
Because true equality is.
I have friends that are brilliant,

341
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,170
that are fantastic human beings,
but they're essentially beach bums.

342
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,260
You know,
they did like kick back and relax and do

343
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,140
the minimal amount of work to get things
done.

344
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:48,530
and just enjoy life,
have a couple cocktails,

345
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:51,170
go to the beach,
have laughs with friends,

346
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,004
that's what they like to do.
And then I have other friends that want 

347
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:54,771
to be,
you know,

348
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:57,620
world martial arts champions and that's,
you know,

349
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,980
you,
you have two different kinds of lives to

350
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,350
different thing to different types of 
human beings.

351
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,184
That style of human one person is going 
to be extremely satisfied with one life 

352
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,773
and extremely dissatisfied with the 
other life and you can interchange them 

353
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:12,254
back and forth.

354
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,810
Well,
you said a bunch of things.

355
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:17,600
We could spend three hours unpacking 
what you Just said.

356
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,910
Um,
let's say a number of things.

357
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:20,744
One,
equality of opportunity is something I 

358
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,530
have yet to find the reasonable person 
that does not agree on this point.

359
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,393
In principle,
lots of people will tell you it's not 

360
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:33,860
worth the effort of trying to pursue it 
because of the danger of what happens if

361
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:35,420
you do.
But nobody disagrees.

362
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,450
Nobody reasonable disagrees that it 
would be desirable to have that equality

363
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:43,460
of outcome.
It's impossible.

364
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,310
If you pursue it,
you end up with a dystopia.

365
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,563
And even if it were possible,
it would not be desirable for the 

366
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:55,130
reasons you point to about the benefits 
of what you're calling competition.

367
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,540
And I would want to tear competition 
into a couple different values.

368
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,540
There's true competition against 
yourself.

369
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,350
You know,
you,

370
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,620
you're skiing down the slope and you're 
paying attention to how you're doing and

371
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:09,050
you're trying to do it better than 
you've done it before,

372
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,920
right?

373
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,140
Um,
and there's competition against others.

374
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,470
And the thing that unites those two 
things is that the,

375
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,000
what you are trying to accomplish is 
real.

376
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,640
It is the world telling you how 
successful you are at something directly

377
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,910
rather than through some sort of social 
channels,

378
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:28,744
some sort of reward handed to you or 
some compliment given to you by 

379
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:32,804
somebody.
and there's a tremendous danger in a 

380
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,523
socially mediated world in which those 
who are successful are successful 

381
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:44,210
because some social thing has told them 
that they are correct because you can be

382
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:45,044
dead wrong,
seem correct and move ahead in social 

383
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:50,320
world.
Whereas if you're doing carpentry,

384
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:55,321
if you're in some sort of competition,
the nature of the beast is one that will

385
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:56,434
tell you when you've got it wrong and 
therefore it will allow you to actually 

386
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,650
improve your insight in whatever form 
you have it.

387
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:03,484
So I'm a tremendous fan of the idea that
even if your world is largely socially 

388
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,044
mediated,
you have to make sure that some part of 

389
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,104
it isn't and you are confronting 
something real enough to tell you when 

390
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,920
you're confused so that you can learn 
how not to be confused,

391
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,663
but there are people in this world that 
do want to push towards an equality of 

392
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,374
outcome and they.
They make it sound as if this is not 

393
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:28,574
Just logical but ethical and possible 
and the future and that you are on the 

394
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,940
wrong side of history.
If you.

395
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,803
If you think that capitalism and 
competition and all these things you 

396
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:43,571
just talked about are good and that 
really the best thing is to force people

397
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,403
to become some sort of utopian creature 
that works together in unison and and 

398
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,190
everybody is a egalitarian and there's 
no need for feminism and men's rights.

399
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,214
Activists,
because everybody looks at everyone as 

400
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:57,220
an equal.

401
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,053
Well,
there are two kinds of people who will 

402
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:04,090
advocate for equality of outcome.
One kind of person who will is confused.

403
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,953
They don't understand what happens if 
you go down this road and the other one 

404
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:11,290
is cynical and they're using this as an 
excuse to justify something that just so

405
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,124
happens to reward them,
but equality of opportunity isn't this 

406
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,640
way.
It solves all of those problems.

407
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,470
Nobody believes that you're going to 
have it ever realized in a perfect form.

408
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:24,304
There's always going to be bad luck.
That's going to reduce somebody's 

409
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,503
opportunity,
which don't want is any systematic bias 

410
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,260
in luck.
In other words,

411
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,263
we're all going to suffer some bad luck 
and we'll all have some good luck and 

412
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:39,490
some of those things will actually shape
the trajectory of our lives,

413
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,810
which you don't want is some population 
that just so happens to suffer more than

414
00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:46,240
its share of bad luck,
which is what we have now.

415
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,910
So there is there just something to 
pursue here,

416
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,510
but we're so busy on this other 
pointless conversation about equality of

417
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:53,344
outcome that we can't.
We can't get back to the thing that we 

418
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:59,020
all agree on,
that's actually the right goal

419
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,433
and there's also some background chatter
that you'll get from the less less 

420
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:05,264
thought out where the people are really 
just upset that other people have more 

421
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,490
and so it's is an uneducated,
not very well thought out perspective on

422
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:17,084
equality of outcome.
They are upset that someone else has 

423
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:20,534
something and they're trying to somehow 
or another diminish the effect of their 

424
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:27,920
hard work and get something for 
themselves.

425
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,780
Well,
you can imagine though,

426
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,230
so maybe we take a little digression 
here.

427
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,540
My experience over the last six months 
has done a bunch of things in my life.

428
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,643
One of them is it has put me in touch 
with quite a number of black 

429
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:45,890
conservatives,
which I must tell you this.

430
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,310
It has changed my understanding of the 
world substantially because I used to.

431
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,290
I knew there were black conservatives 
and I always thought,

432
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,843
are they confused?
Are they not understanding which side 

433
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,730
they should be on and that is not.
That is not what's going on.

434
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,893
What is going on is that there is a 
dialogue which I couldn't hear at least 

435
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,270
which looks at the world.
You can view the unfairness in the world

436
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,610
two different ways.
You can look at it and you can say,

437
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:11,444
well,
they're structural unfairness in the 

438
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:17,501
world and the cards that we in this 
community are dealt are not fair.

439
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,530
We're not getting our share of the good 
cards.

440
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,790
Or you can look at the world from the 
point of view of personal responsibility

441
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,624
and you can say,
well,

442
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,140
it's kind of an academic question.
Whether the cArds you got were fair.

443
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,290
You should play them as best you can.
Give them what they are.

444
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,124
You're.
The thing that I didn't get was one has 

445
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:43,211
almost no ability to address the 
question of how the cards are dealt.

446
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,520
It's just not in.
It's not in the range of somebody.

447
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:48,980
An individual who discovers that the 
cards are unfairly dealt,

448
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:49,814
can't do very much about that fact,
but that individual can do a hell of a 

449
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:57,131
lot about their own position in the 
world by recognizing that actually you,

450
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,043
uh,
especially if the cards are unfairly 

451
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:04,370
dealt,
you need to play them very well and that

452
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:05,204
developing the skill to play them well 
has the ability to overcome at least 

453
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:11,840
some of the unfairness and how they're 
dealt.

454
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,350
And so I have now listened In on this 
commerce.

455
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:16,184
I've been invited into the conversation 
amongst some of these black 

456
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,274
conservatives and this is what,
what they are really saying is that 

457
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:22,964
there is from the point of view of where
to put one's efforts dealing on the 

458
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:29,360
personal responsibility side pays back 
better,

459
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,194
which I don't think frees us in 
civilization from addressing the 

460
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:35,420
question of how the cards are dealt.
I think we should be focused on it,

461
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,643
but anyway,
it more or less solved the mystery in a 

462
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:42,170
way that I thought was,
was quite fascinating.

463
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,180
And uh,
you know,

464
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,470
I'm,
I'm heartened that,

465
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,660
that they were willing to invite me into
that conversation.

466
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:50,900
So I could hear it and finally figure 
out what was what was going on.

467
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,943
So they advocate towards discipline and 
personal responsibility as being core 

468
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,600
tenants that you should reinforce.
Right?

469
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,433
And they are very sensitive to the issue
of what happens when you focus on the 

470
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,640
unfairness of how the cards are dealt,
which is that,

471
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,843
you know,
what progressive's typically miss is 

472
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:12,680
that it really does create a culture of 
dependency if you focus on the fact that

473
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:16,010
the cards are unfairly dealt and that 
that's why you're facing a disadvantage,

474
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:18,440
which is largely true.
Nonetheless,

475
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:23,441
it demotivates you from pursuing success
because you,

476
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:24,394
you,
you recognize that you're starting at a 

477
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,520
disadvantage and that you know,
you're unlikely to win the game.

478
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,590
On the other hand,
the game is and what we think,

479
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,424
you know,
if you can make progress and deliver 

480
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:37,820
your kids a head start relative to where
you were,

481
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,580
that's a win in the game.
So anyway,

482
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,563
again,
I don't want to trivialize any part of 

483
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,484
this.
I think the unfairness of the way the 

484
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:47,430
cards are dealt is really important and 
we have obligations to address it.

485
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,413
But from the point of view of 
individuals within the community trying 

486
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:51,894
to plot a course,
beIng focused on the personal 

487
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,220
responsibility side makes a ton of 
sense.

488
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,230
What are you thoughts on affirmative 
action?

489
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,423
I've changed my tune.
I used to be for affirmative action 

490
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:06,440
because it is justified,
but now the um,

491
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,280
the downsides of it are they loom very 
large for me.

492
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,250
And so what I would say is we want to 
separate the,

493
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:19,251
whether or not it is justified to engage
in some kind of intentional intervention

494
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,980
to fix a problem that has become 
chronic.

495
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,133
Um,
and then we separate that from what it 

496
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:30,690
is that we are advocating and I don't 
think the substitute for it is something

497
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,480
that anybody has properly spelled out.
But um,

498
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,810
but let's just say I would be much more 
inclined to see a substantial investment

499
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,220
in community that makes sense rather 
than it applied at the individual level.

500
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,360
Because I will say before any of what 
happened to me at evergreen happen,

501
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,373
I did have the experience of having 
quite a number of black students in 

502
00:27:56,401 --> 00:28:01,401
particular who suffered a totally a 
stigma that had nothing to do with them.

503
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,850
Students who did very well on their own 
merits,

504
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,713
who lived in a world that was quick to 
judge them as having succeeded based on 

505
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:16,440
some advantage that for all I know they 
didn't even have.

506
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,890
I don't know that any of this.
I mean,

507
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,940
you know,
in the role of professor,

508
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:23,640
you don't necessarIly know how your 
student ends up in front of you,

509
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,713
but I had no reason.
I had some very bright students who I 

510
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:31,860
think suffered a stigma that came from 
the fact that people in general imagined

511
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,640
that affirmative action was playing some
role in their world that it wasn't.

512
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:36,474
I mean,
affirmative action isn't even legal in 

513
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:40,410
Washington.
So the fact that the stigma appends pens

514
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:43,980
to people is preposterous in that 
context in particular.

515
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,660
That's fascinating.
Um,

516
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,533
I had a friend who was a fireman who 
told similar stories and he was talking 

517
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:53,800
about the resentment of the other people
that were on the fire force.

518
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,290
If a guy got in,
even if a guy was qualified,

519
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,820
if a guy was black because they assumed 
that he wasn't as qualified,

520
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:03,040
and the reason why he got through it was
through affirmative action.

521
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,113
He was like,
it's so crazy because what it is is 

522
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:10,600
they're trying to combat racism by 
fueling racism advertently

523
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,543
yes.
It creates this whole cascade of 

524
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,334
effects.
And so the question really the 

525
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:20,220
civilization wide question is what do we
do about.

526
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,030
I mean,
we could retune the analysis for each of

527
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:24,864
the populations in questions.
In the case of black people in the new 

528
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,394
world that is the americas,
most black folks in the new world are 

529
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:34,524
here via the route of slavery.
And the thing is slavery was so brutal 

530
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,383
in destroying the that these people had 
access to where they came from and then 

531
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,103
putting them together in a synthetic 
culture that was built to serve the 

532
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:55,930
masters.
Right?

533
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,650
In other words,
denying black folks the ability to learn

534
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:00,484
to read obviously limits access to the 
huge library of insights that happened 

535
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:12,601
to be a housed with the population that 
transported these folks from,

536
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,010
from africa.
So in any case,

537
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:15,844
my point would be that is hobbling that 
was intentionally hobbling during 

538
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:20,104
slavery.

539
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,270
The legacy of that hobbling is one.
It's hard to quantify.

540
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:30,271
We don't know what role that plays,
but I can say any population that has,

541
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,010
I'm going to speak now as I do as a 
biologist.

542
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:36,844
I think of us as robots that have a 
computer on our shoulders that runs 

543
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:43,450
software and our culture is the 
software.

544
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,213
If you take that robot with the computer
and you delete the software package and 

545
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:49,474
then you install some other software 
package designed to make it do one 

546
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:57,181
particular job that has tremendous harm 
built into it and it's reversible,

547
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,193
but it is not.
I don't think we know that we didn't 

548
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:03,664
succeed in fixing this problem.
I think the emancipation did not 

549
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,273
properly deal with how much harm has 
been done by bringing people from 

550
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,673
different parts of africa and pooling 
them in one population based on 

551
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:19,420
effectively skin color alone.

552
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,210
And then at the point that they were 
freed it,

553
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,830
there was no,
there was no,

554
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:24,664
um,
there was no understanding because our 

555
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:32,500
understanding of biology and culture 
wasn't sophisticated yet.

556
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,510
It still isn't.
And so I think,

557
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,373
I think we do at some point have to do 
an honest accounting of how much damage 

558
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,273
happened in that process.
And we also have to realize that that 

559
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:46,240
damage,
you know,

560
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:47,074
I mean,
I know right now having been active in 

561
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:50,914
trying to make the world a better place,
I know that I'm running a foul of an 

562
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,390
argument called white man's burden.
Right?

563
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,640
and so we all know that this is a 
narrative,

564
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,890
but the point is that white man's burden
argument,

565
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,323
uh,
will be wielded against me for even 

566
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:03,970
saying this,
but nonetheless,

567
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:04,804
I don't see any way around it.
I think the real story of what happened 

568
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,860
in the americas is not,
um,

569
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,220
a nice story and the implications are 
with us to this day,

570
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,720
nobody knows how deep they go because we
haven't studied the question properly.

571
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:20,554
And in fact many of the people who are 
on the left pushing the sort of naive 

572
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,343
narrative about equality are I think 
fearful of what will happen if we study 

573
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,800
the question.
I don't share their fear now.

574
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,800
I think you're right about fearful that 
there's,

575
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:37,634
there's,
there's a lot of like what you were 

576
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:40,070
talking about before,
like

577
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,163
with that woman bringing up ridiculous 
things in meetings and people just sort 

578
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:45,350
of showing their juggler,
please don't attack.

579
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,030
He got a lot of that.
I think of us in terms of,

580
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,183
you know,
the United States or just this massive 

581
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,493
humans.
I think of us as a super organism and I 

582
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:59,540
think if you had an organism that had a 
broken knee,

583
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,531
he would go,
well,

584
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:02,390
I got to fix that knee.
You know,

585
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,310
I can't just give that need less work.
Is it possible to fix the knee?

586
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,600
Yeah.
Well let's fix the knee.

587
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,940
You don't want to just give the knee 
last work,

588
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,220
you don't want to make it easier for the
knee to get by.

589
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,550
What you want to do is strengthen it.
So my thought,

590
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,670
and I've said this as a very simplistic 
way of looking at it,

591
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:22,850
but if you really wanted to make America
great again,

592
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,180
right?

593
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,013
You really want to make America great.
What you would want to do is have less 

594
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:27,854
losers,
so you'd want to go and find these 

595
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:31,094
places where people are in these 
economically deprived areas where 

596
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:37,274
there's a ton of crime and violence and 
they don't have like a real good sense 

597
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:48,230
of like a potential positive outcome 
from where they're at,

598
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:49,064
where they're at,
and transform that with a fraction of 

599
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:53,024
the money that we spent trying to 
rebuild nations and invading 

600
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:56,594
Afghanistan.
We could invest in many of our gigantic 

601
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:04,520
problems that we have in inner cities 
and completely rebuild them.

602
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,713
It could be done and it could have 
radical implications on the entire 

603
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:10,574
country as a whole if you have,
instead of like a place like baltimore 

604
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,531
for instance,
right.

605
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:16,364
I had Michael Woods on who was a former 
police officer in baltimore and he sort 

606
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:23,570
of explained all the different issues 
that happen in baltimore,

607
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:24,404
particularly where there was areas where
they literally weren't selling homes to 

608
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:28,244
black people.

609
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,120
They would not sell homes like this is a
like a white only area.

610
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:37,270
Like they had systematic racism built 
into the system for a long time and just

611
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,290
if someone just invested money into the.
Not someone,

612
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:46,280
the United States government,
if we systematically invested money into

613
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:49,790
these places and rebuilt them with 
community centers,

614
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,940
places where people could go where there
were safe staff,

615
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:56,090
them with a ton of people that were 
motivated counselors.

616
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:59,060
The people that wanted to help give them
activities,

617
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,290
give them skills and trades and show 
them ways out.

618
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,303
Give them a design it that's not nearly 
as impossible as trying to rebuild 

619
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:12,260
Afghanistan or nation building,
but we're doing that.

620
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,670
We're doing that all over the place.
I mean,

621
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:14,504
halliburton got no bid contracts for 
billions of dollars to do shit that we 

622
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,300
don't even know what the fuck they were 
doing over there.

623
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:21,134
Right.
If we could have a fraction of that 

624
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,104
money and invested into inner cities,
you could literally change entire 

625
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:31,050
generations of human beings that are 
coming out of there.

626
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,950
A couple things.
One,

627
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,010
by the way,
I love the analogy of the busted

628
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,040
knee because in fact we used to make 
this mistake medically,

629
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,903
right until recently we didn't really 
understand that part of the healing 

630
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:45,984
process was not protecting the knee,
but putting it through physical therapy 

631
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:49,434
that properly exposed it to stress this 
so that it rebuilt and came back strong 

632
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,550
and so we are making that error and we 
have made that error in terms of what to

633
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,384
do with the stratification of society in
a way that locks up opportunity in some 

634
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:08,184
communities and not others.
I think we should be honest with 

635
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:14,130
ourselves about why that happens.
So I agree.

636
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,443
You could make what would be massive 
investments in communities for a 

637
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:23,880
fraction of what we spend tinkering 
abroad in ways that have just spent huge

638
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,110
amounts of,
um,

639
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,810
of treasure on projects that didn't 
work.

640
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,310
Right?
So we could do that.

641
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,110
The reason that that doesn't happen,
I don't think has anything to do with it

642
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,650
being an obvious that it would be a good
thing to do.

643
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,113
I think it has to do with the same group
selection issue that we were talking 

644
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:47,541
about with respect to communism,
which is to say if you are at the top of

645
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:48,504
the system,
do you want to educate somebody else's 

646
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:56,010
kids to compete with yours?
And so there's a reason that we.

647
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,023
Why do our public schools suck?
Is it because we don't know how to make 

648
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:02,040
a school?
I don't think so.

649
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,293
I think it's because people know how to 
make a school when it's for their kids 

650
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,933
and they're not so interested in making 
a school for other people's kids and so 

651
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:16,821
this is a deep chronic problem with our 
a sociopolitical system.

652
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:20,730
We have to confront that and actually I 
think we have to.

653
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,313
We have to come to agreement that 
actually it is in the long term wise to 

654
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:28,224
educate other people's kids.
Even if in the short term it's 

655
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,820
economically frightening.

656
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,733
Yeah.
The big conspiracy about children in 

657
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:38,664
schools and keeping them stupid and 
making sure that the school system is 

658
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:43,860
frustrating.
And I mean,

659
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:44,694
that's uh,
I've always felt like that conspiracy 

660
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,520
was really just,
there's no motivation to make it better.

661
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:51,050
I mean,
and,

662
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,750
and when you look at the amount of money
that teachers get paid him,

663
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:56,970
it says disturbing the,
you think of the,

664
00:37:56,971 --> 00:37:58,560
uh,
the job of,

665
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:02,380
I don't have to tell you you're a god 
damn teacher too deep,

666
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,700
but you got paid.
Don't go about it that way folks.

667
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,380
But the,
what you've,

668
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,763
what we're talking about here is the 
most important thing that can happen to 

669
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,810
your child in the developmental phase,
right?

670
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:19,170
The education.
Like giving them a view of the world,

671
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,680
explaining them all these things that 
they had not known before.

672
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,603
Your first experiences with so many 
different subjects and topics and 

673
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,370
concepts come from your teachers.

674
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,950
And uh,
I got really lucky man.

675
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,470
I mean I went to a public school in high
school in newton,

676
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,304
Massachusetts.
I went to newton south high school and 

677
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:40,210
it was a really good school and I still 
had shitty teachers.

678
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,620
I still had,
you know,

679
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:42,454
even in that really good school,
it comparatively really good because I 

680
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:47,590
went to a school before that in Jamaica 
plain,

681
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,780
which was like an inner city school and 
it was scary,

682
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,840
real dangerous,
just like just,

683
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,440
you know,
not like the most dangerous in boston,

684
00:38:56,441 --> 00:39:00,910
but very sketchy.
Seventeen year old kids in seventh grade

685
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:05,080
that had never graduated like violence.
A lot of weirdness.

686
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:09,700
Like I had my head down for god through 
that year and then all of a sudden I was

687
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:14,380
in this what we call fast times that 
hebrew high because it was predominantly

688
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,300
jewish neighborhood,
but it was a.

689
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,030
Even then there was,
there was still some terrible teachers.

690
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:19,781
They're,
you know,

691
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:20,614
it's just the job is so important and we
in this country have done some weird 

692
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:31,270
thing where we've taken one of the most 
important jobs that you could ever.

693
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,980
You could ever hire someone to do 
educate children and made it almost like

694
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,220
it's inconsequential.

695
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,920
Yeah.
And I'm hesitant.

696
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm not always hesitant about 
conspiracy.

697
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:46,240
There are conspiracies and we don't deal
well with it,

698
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,990
but one doesn't need conspiracy to 
explain this.

699
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,970
This effectively can evolve without 
anybody's consciously thinking I want to

700
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:57,840
sabotage somebody else's kids school.
Um,

701
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,770
but I will say my experience in school 
was,

702
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,260
it was horrifying.
School did not work for me and maybe,

703
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,123
you know,
every five teachers I hit one invested 

704
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:13,174
and cared and took the time to scratch 
their head about why I wasn't 

705
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,490
succeeding.
And uh,

706
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,493
that must have had an impact on you 
though as an educator that you remember 

707
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,150
those people.
Those one out of five.

708
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,310
Well,
this is the

709
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,020
funny thing is I,
while I was teaching,

710
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:32,021
I taught for 14 years at evergreen and I
felt like maybe I wasn't the only,

711
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:35,354
but I was very nearly the only person on
faculty anywhere that I could think of 

712
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,850
who had not been a good student and 
well,

713
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:44,684
but this was a very interesting window 
because I became a professor because I 

714
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:50,834
loved science.
And so the academy is where science 

715
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:54,980
happened.
Not because I want it to be a teacher.

716
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,873
My experience in school made me want to 
get away from the thing as fast as 

717
00:40:58,521 --> 00:40:59,354
possible.
But having had the experience of school 

718
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:06,350
completely failing and my to my own 
surprise,

719
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:07,184
learning how to think without school,
that's not where I learned that I 

720
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:10,964
learned at primarily from my grandfather
and my brother and other people in my 

721
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,730
environment who weren't associated with 
school.

722
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,983
But once I got to being a professor,
and I think this was only possible at 

723
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:25,094
evergreen,
evergreen made no rules about what you 

724
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:28,520
did in the classroom.

725
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,040
Literally no rule about what subject you
taught.

726
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,970
They could hire you as a biologist and 
could teach dance if people showed up to

727
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,550
take it.
So you could teach whatever you want in.

728
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,660
And the key was you could teach in 
whatever way you wanted.

729
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,930
And so that's so crazy.
Well,

730
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,040
it's like a great idea if you're super 
motivated,

731
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,023
it works two ways.
People abused it and they would use it 

732
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:50,594
to reduce their workload to next to 
nothing and they wouldn't invest in 

733
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,520
their students.
And then other people looked at this and

734
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:56,354
they,
you know,

735
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,253
it was,
it was glorious to have that kind of 

736
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:01,670
freedom.
And so I taught in a way that would have

737
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:04,400
worked for me if I had been a student 
there,

738
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:05,234
which changed a lot of things and it 
actually worked for a lot of bad 

739
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:12,260
students,
don't typically become professors.

740
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,370
So there's almost nobody on the faculty 
anywhere who has a clue why bad students

741
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:17,780
are the way they are,
right.

742
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,240
They just don't intuit it because it 
wasn't their experience.

743
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,130
But if you were like me and you were a 
bad student and then you ended up with a

744
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:25,964
class,
suddenly all sorts of bad students 

745
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:29,324
aren't uncommon.
And so suddenly somebody who's speaking 

746
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:32,024
to them and says,
I know that you're being a bad student 

747
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:36,650
isn't synonymous with you not having 
potential.

748
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,960
Right.
That's really empowering for them.

749
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:40,150
so anyway,
it was a,

750
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:43,680
it was an interesting experience and it 
was.

751
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,850
My wife actually was a tremendous 
student.

752
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:47,684
She loved school and we would actually 
often teach the same students either 

753
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:53,660
together or we would,
they would take my program and then they

754
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:54,494
would bounce over to her program next.
And so they would get these kind of two 

755
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,460
different views.
And you know,

756
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,423
each of us,
we were both enlightened by our 

757
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,630
relationship with each other because,
you know,

758
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,483
to the extent that I might've been 
dismissive of the great students right 

759
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:11,810
here,
I had one who,

760
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,060
you know,
was my,

761
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,263
my closest person on earth and you know,
I got to a window into how she saw the 

762
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:18,944
world and she got a window into what the
kids who weren't performing well in 

763
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,070
school might've been thinking.
And so anyway,

764
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:25,904
that was a very,
very useful background to have for 

765
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:29,140
teaching.

766
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,620
There's a tremendous amount of power and
teachIng people.

767
00:43:32,621 --> 00:43:33,454
It's a weird relationship between,
and especially when you're teaching 

768
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:40,780
someone and you're giving them credit 
towards their degree.

769
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,790
Um,
I,

770
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,240
I was very poor student in high school 
and I've wasted a ton of time just going

771
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,710
to college.
So people didn't think I was a loser,

772
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,430
but I taught at boston university.
I used to teach taekwondo and I taught a

773
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:57,730
credited course.
It was pass fail a,

774
00:43:57,731 --> 00:43:59,620
but it actually counted towards your 
gpa.

775
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,570
So I hAd kids in my class and I would 
tell them it's really simple,

776
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:05,404
just try and you get an a,
just show up and try and I'll give you 

777
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:14,041
an a because like athletics or it's not,
it's not fair.

778
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,430
You know,
there's people that are just extreme end

779
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,273
dearborn person.
Their body holds onto too much fat and 

780
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:20,514
they're not.
They didn't have a background in any 

781
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,650
athletics.
They're not flexible.

782
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:24,484
It's very difficult for them to 
understand how to move their body 

783
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,210
correctly.
There's,

784
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:32,190
It's essentially like trying teach 
someone

785
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,023
to be a professional speaker where 
someone has been speaking english their 

786
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:38,940
whole life where other people just 
learning it for the first time.

787
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,073
It didn't seem fair to me.
So to judge them in terms of the actual 

788
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,190
outcome.
That was like a.

789
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,690
It's almost contrary to what I said.
I was giving them a quality of outcome,

790
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,350
but not really.
No,

791
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,240
I,
I was.

792
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,260
I'm pretty sure I know what you were 
doing because I did the same thing.

793
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,183
So I would tell students,
you show up and try and you are 

794
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:01,674
completely safe.
You're going to get full credit and 

795
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,090
you'll get a nice evaluation.
We wrote written evaluations to them,

796
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,840
but if you want an evaluation that raves
about you,

797
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,620
that talks about you know your,
your extraordinary capacity,

798
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:17,010
you're going to have to strive and so 
what I wanted to do,

799
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:17,844
which sounds like what you were doing is
make them safe enough to discover what 

800
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:21,234
they could do because I don't know 
whether this will make sense to your 

801
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,850
audience or not,
but I think we are overly concerned.

802
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,600
We have been sold.
The idea that the job of a teacher is to

803
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,310
assess how much the student has learned 
that basically the job of the teacher is

804
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:42,060
largely to report out to the world how 
qualified this person has.

805
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,720
That's a very hard job in some 
disciplines in mind.

806
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,720
You know,
the student who did brilliantly,

807
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,613
I would know,
and the student who did nothing I would 

808
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:52,794
usually know,
but there were lots of students in the 

809
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:54,984
middle who might have gotten the lesson 
really deeply and it might have matured 

810
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
over the course of two years after they 
were no longer in contact with me.

811
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:05,964
At the point I was writing the 
evaluation of them that might not have 

812
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,950
been a good place to assess how much 
they've actually learned,

813
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,180
so I,
I steered away from the idea that my job

814
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:17,730
was to tell the world how well this 
person had done,

815
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:19,860
unless they'd done great,
if they'd done really well,

816
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:20,760
if they'd,
you know,

817
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,970
surprise themselves and me about 
everything that they were capable of.

818
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,803
I loved saying that,
but I didn't want to run down a student 

819
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,913
who hadn't really shined in the 
classroom because there's was a totally 

820
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:35,730
artificial moment to judge how much they
had picked up.

821
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,040
Yeah.
No need to run them down.

822
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,480
Yup.
And again,

823
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,420
everybody's starting off at a different 
position.

824
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:43,254
It's not like everybody's on the same 
lIne and the gun goes off and everybody 

825
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:49,530
runs with the first step in the same 
spot.

826
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:51,230
It's just not the case.
right.

827
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,640
And there's some or many activities in 
which your,

828
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,043
how you do initially doesn't necessarily
predict ultimately whether you'll be 

829
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,080
unusually good.
Sure.

830
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,801
Yeah.
Well,

831
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:05,634
one of the things that I found,
particularly with athletics is that 

832
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:08,814
people who are extraordinarily gifted 
oftentimes don't excel because it seems 

833
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:17,901
to come too easy for them and they never
develop the proper stamina for hard,

834
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,133
difficult work.
they shy away from that because if 

835
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:23,740
things aren't easy,
they know.

836
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:24,623
Here's a perfect example.
People that are really gifted in one 

837
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:28,650
asset,
one martial art,

838
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:29,883
like say like

839
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,903
someone who's gifted as a striker will,
they'll enter into mixed martial arts 

840
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:37,360
and find that they really are not very 
good at grappling.

841
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,590
And so they don't like that feeling of 
being dominated in training.

842
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,920
So they don't give it 100 percent.
They don't throw themselves into it.

843
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,754
Instead,
they avoid it and they try to find 

844
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,100
workarounds and they're almost always 
defeated by grapplers.

845
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,570
It's like they,
they've,

846
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,120
because of the fact that they're gifted 
and talented,

847
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,420
they've avoided the difficult real a 
character building moments.

848
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,760
So this,
this is interesting that you say that.

849
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,810
I was on a train in New York and,
uh,

850
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,003
looking at twitter and somebody had 
posted an article that caused the dime 

851
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:14,854
to drop for me with respect to mixed 
martial arts and why they were suddenly 

852
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:20,650
a thing in my life where they hadn't 
been.

853
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:21,484
I had assumed that it was simply the 
fact that I'd showed up on your podcast 

854
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:27,520
and obviously you're in that world.
and so a certain number of mixed martial

855
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:28,354
arts people,
we're now following me and I was seeing 

856
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,560
their tweets and things.
But this guy,

857
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:33,394
I think his name is John Kirby,
posted an article that he had written 

858
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,720
about Bruce Lee and his argument,
did you see this article?

859
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:41,563
No argument was why I'm Bruce Lee and 
mixed martial arts points the direction 

860
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:48,490
to how to fix our political dialogue 
something.

861
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,200
Huh?
Um,

862
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,880
and so anyway,
his argument was,

863
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:54,160
and you know,
I'm no expert on this at all.

864
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,690
Um,
but his argument was that Bruce Lee,

865
00:48:58,691 --> 00:48:59,524
effectively the,
the innovator at the beginning of mixed 

866
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:03,244
martial arts,
was interested in testing a martial art 

867
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,663
against all comers rather than requiring
the person on the other side to be 

868
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:14,763
practicing the same martial art and that
there is a kind of model in that for 

869
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,380
other disciplines than any,
anytime,

870
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,243
if your debate style requires somebody 
to be debating in the same way on the 

871
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:31,510
other side of the argument that it isn't
very strong,

872
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,823
right then it's a formalism.
But if you're reAlly good at arguing 

873
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:39,400
that it shouldn't really matter as long 
as the person speaks the same language,

874
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:42,850
you should be able to meet them on that 
playing field and hash stuff out.

875
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:44,170
So anyway,
I,

876
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,113
I,
I think a number of things linked up in 

877
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:48,964
this way that there is a kind of 
artificial boundary placed between 

878
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:57,940
things and that,
those who are interested in tearing down

879
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:58,774
those boundaries,
even though that opens up a huge range 

880
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:02,344
of things that they may face often have 
something to teach in their particular 

881
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,220
realm.
And um,

882
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,760
I was trying to think of other examples 
of this and a lars anderson archer.

883
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,350
Again,
this is a place where you're an expert,

884
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,470
but what do you think of lars anderson?

885
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,593
Well,
he does like a lot of weird trick shots 

886
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:26,130
with archery.
It's kind of fun to watch.

887
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,993
Very interesting stuff.
And what he's essentially done is he 

888
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:30,284
believes he has not reinvented but 
rediscovered a method of holding arrows 

889
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:40,270
in your fingers so that you could,
with practice repeat here,

890
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,123
jamie's got video,
this character that you could release a 

891
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:50,141
bunch of arrows in a row and he,
he's capable of shooting like way faster

892
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:53,660
than the average person and multiple 
arrows.

893
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,673
He can throw things in the air and hit 
it with multiple arrows before it hits 

894
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:58,754
the ground.

895
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:03,550
Yep.
So my thought here is that this is,

896
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,140
I have a number of different examples.
So there is throwing them.

897
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,210
Oh,
here he's going to throw a bottle cap in

898
00:51:10,211 --> 00:51:12,760
the air and he hits it with an arrow.
So crazy.

899
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,550
Even if there are lots of cuts here with
that,

900
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:16,384
we're not seeing where he misses the 
fact that he can do this with enough 

901
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:22,000
reliability to make a video to make a 
video.

902
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,893
You can tell there are enough things 
where he hits two things in one shot 

903
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:26,890
that it's not,
it can't be completely fiction.

904
00:51:26,891 --> 00:51:27,724
And if you look at his explanatory.
So he took a lot of crap for this from 

905
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,133
people who were in the archery world who
didn't like the way he violated all of 

906
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:38,020
the rules about what good archery form 
looks like.

907
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,980
And so he made a response video.
English isn't his first langUage,

908
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:43,030
so it's a little hard to follow.

909
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,863
But,
um,

910
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,950
but any way it's pretty clear that what 
he's done is he's just said,

911
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,000
well,
okay,

912
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,770
there are bose.
They're arrows.

913
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:51,663
What is the best way to think about 
these things from the point of view of 

914
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:56,410
solving these different problems?
And he's discovered a whole landscape of

915
00:51:56,411 --> 00:52:01,300
stuff that I don't think you would 
discover if you took archery and took it

916
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:05,020
seriously and learned from a master who 
had good form.

917
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,030
You'd never discover it.
And,

918
00:52:07,031 --> 00:52:08,350
uh,
I guess I'm there.

919
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,720
Might as well put the other examples on 
the table.

920
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,460
Um,
let's see.

921
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,240
There's a danny macaskill,
the bicyclist.

922
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:22,210
Are you aware of this guy?
I feel like I've heard that name before.

923
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,070
Scottish kid.
He's very young.

924
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,020
Um,
I think at some point,

925
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:26,854
unfortunately he became a surprise 
surprise sensation on youtube and red 

926
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:34,060
bull figured out that he was a money 
maker and they sort of pushed him.

927
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:36,610
So he's now had a couple of serious 
accidents.

928
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,550
But,
um,

929
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,553
anyway,
he Is capable of doing things on a 

930
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:42,010
bicycle especially,
you know,

931
00:52:42,011 --> 00:52:44,260
in an urban environment,
hopping from

932
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,190
this guy,
this guy exists.

933
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,770
did you see that?
That was one of these guys,

934
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:52,810
these daredevil youtube,
god's just died.

935
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,150
a guy in China.
Oh god,

936
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,710
yeah.
this gets out of his,

937
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,910
out of his mind.
BuT I mean,

938
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,910
check that out for people that are 
listening.

939
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:05,500
Only this guy's on a rooftop and he's 
doing these stents where he's riding his

940
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:06,334
bike,
doing flips from one side of the 

941
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:09,574
building to the other.
He's riding on the edges of the 

942
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:13,810
building,
looking down,

943
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:17,010
hitting the brakes certain death on 
either side.

944
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,863
I mean,
look at that.

945
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,740
Oh,
I have a hard time looking at that.

946
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,770
It's pretty rough.
It's pretty rough.

947
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:24,810
But,
you know,

948
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,980
and it's fallen and hurt

949
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,320
himself.
and that's not a bmx bike either.

950
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,910
No,
it's like a regular bike.

951
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,510
It's,
it's,

952
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,820
uh,
I think it's not quite standard,

953
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:35,640
but it's a,
it's more mountain bike proportions,

954
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,593
but anyway,
just,

955
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,460
it's probably has to b to b.
So rugged,

956
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:39,610
right?
Oh yeah.

957
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:40,443
It's souped up in particular ways so 
that it can endure the kind of forces 

958
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:44,810
that he's on it.
But he's,

959
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,420
he's discovered stuff about what you can
do with a bicycle that I think you just.

960
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,371
I mean,
in fact,

961
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:51,720
you know,
in the era we grew up,

962
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,810
we didn't know that these things were 
possible and you know,

963
00:53:53,811 --> 00:53:55,890
what he's doing emerged from,
uh,

964
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,263
from observed trials,
which was a very regimented kind of 

965
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:01,980
competition for,
for mountain bikers.

966
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:02,940
But,
um,

967
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:03,774
but anyway,
he's discovered a landscape of 

968
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:05,604
possibilities on a bicycle,
not unlike the lamps landscape of 

969
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:11,210
possibilities that lars anderson has 
discovered in a,

970
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:15,600
in archery park who are,
is another place where,

971
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,310
you know,
growing up,

972
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,220
I didn't know that all that was possible
and I thought,

973
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,200
um,
you know,

974
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,253
frankly,
I thought that olympic gymnastics was 

975
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:24,630
pretty interesting.

976
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,853
And you know,
now I look at olympic gymnastics and I 

977
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:30,480
think that's a.
I mean,

978
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:32,220
I get it.
It's team.

979
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:33,054
And the thing is it has one advantage 
which is that everything is so 

980
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:39,510
standardized that you can compare to 
competitors.

981
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:40,344
If you want to award a medal,
it maybe it has to look like olympic 

982
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,590
gymnastics,
but,

983
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:44,923
um,
but these guys who can look at an urban 

984
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:48,144
environment and figure out how they can 
make use of these objects and their 

985
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:54,660
relationship to each other,
uh,

986
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:57,690
are discovering something about what the
human body is capable of.

987
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,760
That isn't the obvioUs.
Uh,

988
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,320
if you,
you know,

989
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,870
if there isn't somebody to pointed out,
so there are innovators.

990
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:04,704
I don't even know if we know who the 
initial innovators are with something 

991
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:09,450
like park who are probably somebody 
does.

992
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,433
Russians could be russian kids.
You ever seen those videos of them 

993
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,120
hanging off of the side of buildings?

994
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,310
I really think that they were the 
innovators of this,

995
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,423
the,
that was the first stuff that we ever 

996
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:21,720
saw.
Maybe french word,

997
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:23,340
right?
What's our core french?

998
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,540
I think so,
yeah.

999
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,640
Um,
but in any case,

1000
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,350
uh,
one of the things,

1001
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,220
and you know,
you,

1002
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,030
when you,
uh,

1003
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,260
when you asked me to come on,
we,

1004
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,273
we decided we would talk a little bit 
about what to do about planet earth 

1005
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,870
because I had mentioned the first time 
was on your show that,

1006
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:38,170
that was a,
uh,

1007
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,870
an employee from parker.
Well,

1008
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:40,704
but my feeling is actually this is,
this is about parker and my point is 

1009
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,353
where we are with civilization.
We're stuck and we are on a trajectory 

1010
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,713
that you don't have to be deeply 
knowledgeable to recognize that it is 

1011
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:05,271
unstable on enough different fronts that
we can't go on like this much longer.

1012
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:08,740
We're playing with powerful enough tools
that were in tremendous danger.

1013
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,160
Something going wrong,
and so the question is,

1014
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,260
it's very hard to imagine how you use 
normal tools,

1015
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,650
you know,
are you going to win an election and get

1016
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,950
policy through congress that's going to 
change the world and suddenly make us,

1017
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,900
it's almost impossible to imagine 
something like that happening.

1018
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,500
And so the question is,
is there a park core kind of innovation,

1019
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,500
something that is not obvious to us,
that's,

1020
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,540
it's there.
The city was always there.

1021
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,690
People were not always doing park who 
are with the objects in it,

1022
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:44,260
but they could have been.
And so are we missing the obvious?

1023
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:45,094
Is it in front of us,
what we're supposed to do to take a 

1024
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:47,704
civilization that's hurdling out of 
control with too many people consuming 

1025
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:53,050
too fast,
um,

1026
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:58,051
and using mechanisms that are dangerous.
Is there a route to put us back on track

1027
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,384
to something reasonable that looks like 
one of these innovations that you don't 

1028
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:07,330
know it existed until somebody shows you
that it's there?

1029
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:12,170
So what do you think those things are?
Well,

1030
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,890
I assume there's more than one,
right?

1031
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,753
There's more than one.
I would say the conversation doesn't 

1032
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:23,731
sound familiar and I don't think anybody
has the answer to that question.

1033
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,173
I,
I,

1034
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,930
before I go deeply into this question,
I should probably say something a little

1035
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:32,764
bit self protective,
which is talking about the question of 

1036
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:42,151
what to do with planet earth can be.
It can be an idol of discussion,

1037
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:45,820
in which case there's no,
there's nothing to be navigated,

1038
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:46,923
but if you want to do it seriously,
there's a danger of triggering a kind 

1039
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:52,860
of,
um,

1040
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,240
reflective penalty that we all carry 
around.

1041
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,960
So arrogance is something that we don't 
like.

1042
00:57:58,990 --> 00:57:59,823
people don't like to hear people being 
arrogant and so we all have like a 

1043
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:05,200
detector for that,
that we,

1044
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,820
we,
we listen.

1045
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,773
And when somebody strays into arrogance,
maybe it goes off in order to have a 

1046
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,470
conversation about what to do about 
planet earth.

1047
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,333
Obviously we're talking about very 
serious stuff and for anybody to 

1048
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:19,924
contemplate that they might know or 
might be tuned into a conversation that 

1049
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:29,680
could find its way to some new answer.
We are in danger of triggering that.

1050
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:30,610
uh,
oh my god,

1051
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:33,430
that's arrogant circuit.
And so at some level,

1052
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,350
in order to have this conversation 
properly,

1053
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:39,820
I need to,
I need to turn off my own sensitivity to

1054
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:42,640
hearing that little warning bell in my 
own head.

1055
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,380
And you know,
if,

1056
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:49,900
if the conversation is preposterous,
a fine,

1057
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,780
that's something a reasonable person 
could conclude about.

1058
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,750
Anybody who was talking about changing 
the way the world functions.

1059
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,540
maybe it is preposterous and I leave 
that possibility open.

1060
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,370
And the other hand,
um,

1061
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,200
you know,
I have kids,

1062
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,730
I'm pretty sure I can do the math myself
on how much danger we're in.

1063
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,623
I may not know the full extent of it,
but I can tell that we're in enough 

1064
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:10,834
danger that we have to do something 
counter intuitive and different enough 

1065
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:20,311
that it stands a chance of changing the 
way the place functions or my kids.

1066
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,330
and your kids are in serious trouble.
So anyway,

1067
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,180
that's why I would,
would go down this road,

1068
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,273
but I have to do it in that kind of 
context where I'm not too worried about 

1069
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,460
whether people hear this as,
you know,

1070
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,620
me being full of myself or something 
like that.

1071
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,650
Does that makes sense?
Why would,

1072
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,770
why would I get it?
It's a lack.

1073
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,970
Those self protective instincts.
I just spout off.

1074
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,500
All right,
fair enough.

1075
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,240
But go ahead.
Okay.

1076
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,500
so there are a lot of.
So I should say where,

1077
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:52,334
where does this all come from?
My initial foray into this style of 

1078
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:02,330
thinking actually starts with erIc,
who you had on your podcast.

1079
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:06,050
I saw a lot of feedback about him on 
your podcast was great.

1080
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,710
People were really jazzed about.
Brilliant.

1081
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:12,260
You have brilliant brother.
I have all noticed that he is absolutely

1082
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:17,390
amazing and there's no place to hide 
from him because he is so good across,

1083
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,330
you know,
all levels of analysis.

1084
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:25,190
So he obviously even on your podcast,
he was playing around in biology space.

1085
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:27,440
Very adeptly.
I can't do that.

1086
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:31,040
I can't go over into math space and do 
the same favor for him.

1087
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,330
But um,
but anyway,

1088
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:33,110
yeah,
he's a,

1089
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:33,943
he's a very interesting thinker and 
across many more levels than I think 

1090
01:00:38,631 --> 01:00:41,810
anybody else I've encountered.
But anyway,

1091
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,430
he,
some years ago,

1092
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,264
after the financial collapse of 2008,
he decIded that there needed to be a 

1093
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,463
proactive discussion about what had gone
wrong and economic space that had 

1094
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,124
allowed that catastrophe to happen.
And so he and some collaborators put 

1095
01:01:03,501 --> 01:01:08,300
together a conference called the 
economic manhattan project.

1096
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,420
It was at the perimeter institute in,
in Canada.

1097
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:17,170
And so I went,
I attended this conference and it was,

1098
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:18,643
it was the first place I encountered an 
intentional conversation about changing 

1099
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:23,563
a large enough piece of the puzzle to 
actually fix the way the world works to 

1100
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:30,710
prevent another financial collapse like 
the one that happened in 2008.

1101
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:31,993
And I also met people at that conference
who have continued on in these 

1102
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,670
conversations.
Um,

1103
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:41,450
I joined occupy,
I mean,

1104
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:43,130
not that there was anything really to 
join,

1105
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:43,964
but I participated in it in hopes that 
it would turn into something capable of 

1106
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:49,094
changIng the way we functioned.
And I ended up being very disappointed 

1107
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:55,850
and frustrated by the quality of the 
conversation inside of,

1108
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,720
of occupy wall street.
But anyway,

1109
01:01:58,721 --> 01:02:00,950
it,
it revealed some things to me.

1110
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,890
And then after that,
there was a,

1111
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,473
um,
a group of people who gathered in a 

1112
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:12,340
something that ultimately was called 
game be end.

1113
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:17,350
Game b is really where the thinking that
I want to talk to you about emerged most

1114
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:21,120
clearly.
Game be no longer exists,

1115
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:25,410
but a group of us from across the 
political spectrum,

1116
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,220
various different kinds of expertise.
we had tech people,

1117
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:31,980
we had professors from various different
disciplines.

1118
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,813
We had a buddhist,
I mean we really had a lot of different 

1119
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:38,850
people who were united basically by an 
understanding that,

1120
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:40,403
that they had each arrived at the 
trajectory we were on was so dangerous 

1121
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:48,900
that it required us to take action.
And we tried out various different ideas

1122
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:52,890
about what might,
what might be sufficient to,

1123
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:54,363
um,
to avert the danger we were heading 

1124
01:02:56,401 --> 01:03:01,401
towards and give humanity more time to,
to find a way to exist on the planet.

1125
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,683
So I should probably say something about
what game b means and it carries a 

1126
01:03:08,141 --> 01:03:10,530
relevance into,
into what we might do in the present.

1127
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,083
Game b was basically proceeded from the 
idea that what we live in is a game 

1128
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:19,770
theoretic landscape,
right?

1129
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:20,963
That the winners in this game theoretic 
landscape are individuals who have 

1130
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:24,864
figured out where there's a niche,
some of them have figured out how to 

1131
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:29,394
engage in something called rent seeking,
which rent seeking basically means 

1132
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:37,161
making money without producing some 
without producing value.

1133
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:38,363
So there's a lot of stuff that goes on 
in our economy that is not productive 

1134
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:43,350
and good,
but nonetheless generates fortunes.

1135
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:46,950
So that's rent seeking as opposed to 
innovation or productivity.

1136
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,260
You're talking about like hedge fund 
type stuff,

1137
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,300
moving money around.
Well,

1138
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:52,134
I want to be a little careful about this
because it is quite possible for things 

1139
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:57,594
like hedge funds to actually correct 
inefficiencies in the economy in a way 

1140
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:02,094
that is productive.
It doesn't mean that that's the average 

1141
01:04:03,991 --> 01:04:05,010
thing.
That's two things.

1142
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:06,450
Are you referring to?
Well,

1143
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:07,081
I mean,
you know,

1144
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:08,040
let's,
let's take the,

1145
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,620
the ultimate example that will make it 
clear.

1146
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:15,020
A warlord is not responsible for,
um,

1147
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,253
for building the road that they then 
stand by the side of and extort money 

1148
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,064
from people who want to travel it.
A cable company may produce some 

1149
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:28,194
benefit.
They obviously have infrastructure that 

1150
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:30,624
allows you to get content,
but what fraction of what you're paying 

1151
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:34,284
for is actually about them delivering a 
service at some price and making some 

1152
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:39,090
reasonable profit.

1153
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:39,923
And what fraction of it is about the 
fact that they are an economic goliath 

1154
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,500
and that you don't have enough choice to
be able to negotiate a decent price with

1155
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:48,990
them.
So there's some fraction of what they're

1156
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:49,824
producing that is productive,
but then there's a large amount of 

1157
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:55,440
profit there that isn't about 
productivity or innovation.

1158
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:59,040
It's about the fact that they own a 
choke point and you can't get around it.

1159
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,563
Um,
so we don't know what fraction of the 

1160
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:08,991
economy is a rent seeking and what 
fraction of it is productive.

1161
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,583
But there is,
especially if one is broadminded about 

1162
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:15,780
thinking about all the ways that one can
engage in rent seeking.

1163
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,393
One can actually be destructive of value
if you destroy future wellbeing for our 

1164
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:26,860
descendants,
It may look productive in the present,

1165
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:29,500
but it isn't productive.
It's actually destructive.

1166
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,640
So that's a kind of rent seeking that we
don't even typically model.

1167
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:36,940
But uh,
where,

1168
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:39,040
where are we headed?
So,

1169
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:42,970
oh yes.
So we live in a game theoretic landscape

1170
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,610
that's both good and bad.
As you point out,

1171
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:46,444
competition is a healthy thing and 
competition in markets produces a huge 

1172
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:54,940
amount of value.
So I hear people,

1173
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,330
deriding capitalism,
and I always want to make the same point

1174
01:05:58,331 --> 01:05:59,164
to them,
which is you've got two things glued 

1175
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:06,151
together and you are challenging them as
a package,

1176
01:06:06,431 --> 01:06:08,950
but there's no reason they have to be 
packaged.

1177
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:11,530
So we would be foolish to give up 
markets.

1178
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:15,100
Markets are amazingly powerful.
Engines of innovation.

1179
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:19,570
they are capable of solving problems 
that we cannot solve deliberately,

1180
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:22,450
even if we want it to.
so we need markets,

1181
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,823
but we don't want markets ruling the 
planet and deciding that anything that 

1182
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:28,414
spits out a profit is therefore good and
that we should be exposed to whatever 

1183
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:34,840
the market discovers can be a viable.

1184
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:39,190
So what we want is ultimately to 
provide,

1185
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:43,600
um,
provide incentive structures that caused

1186
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:46,210
the market to produce things that are 
good for us,

1187
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,040
right?
In other words,

1188
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:51,550
have you tell the market that you want 
the solution to some problem,

1189
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,413
the market can figure out how to solve 
that problem and it will do it very 

1190
01:06:54,971 --> 01:06:55,804
well.
But if you allow the market to decide 

1191
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:00,610
what problems to solve,
it may end up,

1192
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:03,400
for example,
addicting you to your phone,

1193
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:04,623
right addicting to you,
to your phone in a way that harms your 

1194
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:07,770
social relationships,
harms your,

1195
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:08,653
your parenting of your children,
harms all kinds of things that are 

1196
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:11,914
really important,
breaks the ability of your children to 

1197
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:18,160
have a educational experience in school.
we don't want the market discovering how

1198
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:18,994
to disrupt useful functioning of people.
We want the market to stay out of that 

1199
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:26,440
stuff.
And then to provide us benefits that,

1200
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,400
uh,
only,

1201
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:28,234
uh,
can provide like all of the mechanisms 

1202
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:36,541
that now allow us to navigate seamlessly
in places that we've never been avoiding

1203
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:39,040
traffic that we wouldn't know to worry 
about,

1204
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:39,520
right?

1205
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,353
Those are huge benefits and they're 
capable of taking a city that is to 

1206
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:45,424
snarled with traffic and reducing the 
degree to which it is snarled with 

1207
01:07:47,861 --> 01:07:49,210
traffic.
So they're very powerful,

1208
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,630
but we shouldn't,
we shouldn't throw the baby out with the

1209
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,490
bathwater.
markets are good.

1210
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,593
Allowing markets to discover any and 
every mechanism for exploiting you is 

1211
01:08:00,731 --> 01:08:02,680
not good at all.
And in fact,

1212
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:06,070
it's a large part of why we're in the 
predicament that we're in,

1213
01:08:06,071 --> 01:08:06,904
is that we let the market decide what 
problems to solve and then if it solves 

1214
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:13,810
them and they're very,
a lucrative,

1215
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:18,560
there's no way to say no.
Once I say attractive to people.

1216
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,020
I mean,
that's one of the reasons why a phone,

1217
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:20,854
uh,
so addictive is because it's attractive 

1218
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:25,220
because you can get access to 
information at the drop of a hat.

1219
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:29,780
So you just constantly one of feed that 
machine it constantly to like,

1220
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:30,614
oh,
well,

1221
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,400
what can I do?

1222
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,660
Can I play a game on it?
Ooh,

1223
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:34,100
can I take a picture of myself?
Ooh,

1224
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,090
can I give myself a dog knows?
Oh,

1225
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,360
right.
But imagine.

1226
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,670
I mean,
it's,

1227
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:41,660
it's amazing to me that it's even hard 
to do this thought experiment,

1228
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:43,890
but put yourself in,
you know,

1229
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:49,420
in your own mind 15 years ago and 
present yourself the deal that the phone

1230
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:53,960
represents,
you know,

1231
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,490
hey joe,
alright,

1232
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,440
check this phone out,
right?

1233
01:08:57,441 --> 01:09:00,950
This phone is going to allow you to 
navigate in a place you've never been.

1234
01:09:00,951 --> 01:09:05,390
It's going to connect you with all sorts
of people who share your interest.

1235
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,224
You're going to be able to say a 
sentence that you think is clever and 

1236
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:12,690
suddenly hundreds or thousands of people
are going to be able to react to it.

1237
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,630
I mean all sorts of marvelous.
Thanks.

1238
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:16,790
And then the point is,
well,

1239
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,710
here's the downside,
okay,

1240
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:19,544
you're going to be hooked into mega 
corporations that are going to study 

1241
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:24,254
your psychology and they are going to 
compete in order to keep you paying 

1242
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:28,844
attention to their site and they're 
going to become so sophisticated that 

1243
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:35,840
you're going to lose control over your 
own mind.

1244
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:36,733
You are going to become addicted to it 
in the way that you might become 

1245
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:40,910
addicted to nicotine.
Right?

1246
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:43,850
so that that's a pretty high cost.
What's more,

1247
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:44,893
you are going to surveil yourself,
you're going to surveil yourself and 

1248
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,043
your only protection from surveilling 
yourself are going to be end user 

1249
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:55,034
license agreements that you're not going
to be legally sophisticated enough to 

1250
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:57,884
understand and so you're going to be at 
the mercy of whoever has access to your 

1251
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:03,650
phone camera,
your metadata,

1252
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,611
your,
you know,

1253
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:06,470
all of these things.
So the point is,

1254
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,460
if you sAid this to you 15 years ago,
you'd know to be afraid of it,

1255
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,360
right?
I probably wouldn't be like,

1256
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,220
eh,
I'll put it down if I don't like it.

1257
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,473
Okay,
well,

1258
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,733
I must tell you,
if you told me that I was going to be 

1259
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:24,470
bugging myself with a sophisticated 
device like that,

1260
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,510
that I know I can't even.
I can't even turn it upside down because

1261
01:10:28,511 --> 01:10:33,511
of the camera on both sides of the dams.
I mean the cost is really high,

1262
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:38,060
but we signed up for it incrementally in
a way that never left the ability to say

1263
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,740
no and what's worse,
it is not inconceivable.

1264
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:43,574
If we discovered that the net cost of 
such a device exceeded the value of it 

1265
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:50,600
by 10 times,
we still couldn't get rid of them.

1266
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:52,690
You can't pull them back.
You can't unmake them.

1267
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,470
There's too much benefit to them though.
You're,

1268
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:55,304
you're,
you're making it seem as if it's only a 

1269
01:10:56,551 --> 01:10:58,710
negative,
but it's not only a negative,

1270
01:10:58,711 --> 01:10:59,544
it's also answering every single 
question you could ever have about 

1271
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,950
anything technical,
anything involving history,

1272
01:11:04,951 --> 01:11:09,951
anything involving facts and obviously 
in today's day and age with hashtag fake

1273
01:11:10,741 --> 01:11:11,574
news,
you're going to get a lot of bullshit 

1274
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:14,040
facts in there as,
but just

1275
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,873
the sheer access to information,
they'd be able to ability to contact 

1276
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,830
each other instantaneously as a lot of 
pros to it.

1277
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,750
Huge number.
I'm believe me,

1278
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:24,020
I'm not underwriting the value of.
I mean you just,

1279
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,620
you know,
you pointed to it yourself.

1280
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:30,300
Having even just wikipedia in your 
pocket is like,

1281
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,253
that's such a fantastic gift to have 
that access to information not only on 

1282
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,500
your home computer but right there in 
your pocket.

1283
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,334
That's amazing.
So I'm not saying the benefit isn't 

1284
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:40,914
spectacular and you know,
I've signed up for it like everybody 

1285
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,830
else,
but the cost is very high end.

1286
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:48,780
Didn't have to be.
In other words,

1287
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,733
if you had set the bounds in which the 
market was going to solve this problem 

1288
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,620
so that you,
for example,

1289
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:00,540
prevented it from breaching our ability 
to protect our own privacy.

1290
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,523
You could have had the benefit of 
wikipedia and instant communication and 

1291
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:07,320
all of these things without the huge 
downside.

1292
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:11,580
So the privacy issue being cookies or 
cameras like which.

1293
01:12:11,581 --> 01:12:13,440
Which one are you referring to?
Well,

1294
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:14,274
first of all,
I think the cameras are a bit of a red 

1295
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:16,420
herring.
I don't think anybody at.

1296
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:17,263
First of all there's a huge amount of 
data involved in video to the extent 

1297
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:21,564
there's an issue.
It would be more about the microphone 

1298
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:24,983
and the fact that it can listen in to 
conversations and basically track who's 

1299
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:28,824
thinking what.
And there's so much power in that 

1300
01:12:30,211 --> 01:12:31,320
potentially,
that even,

1301
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,543
even if it's not being used presently,
it's only a matter of time before 

1302
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:36,324
somebody taps into that data and starts 
using it to shape things they are not 

1303
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:42,920
entitled to shape.
Um,

1304
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,490
so how do we fix it?
Well,

1305
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,800
so I mean,
we've gotten a little off track here.

1306
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,670
Game a is what we live,
right?

1307
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:52,530
It's a market in which we decide how to 
behave.

1308
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:55,800
And if we have insight,
maybe we come out ahead.

1309
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,720
If we don't have correct insight,
maybe we lose.

1310
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,890
But anyway,
that's,

1311
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:02,780
that's gay may.
It's,

1312
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:04,500
it's,
it's the market as we find it.

1313
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:09,300
Game b was the idea that,
um,

1314
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,433
that there are ways that you could 
restructure the deal we have with each 

1315
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:19,041
other so that you could compete in game 
a's terms without losing to game.

1316
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,020
So the,
the conclusion.

1317
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:25,883
And again,
game b is not a live organization 

1318
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:28,734
anymore,
but it was a place in which a lot of 

1319
01:13:29,641 --> 01:13:30,474
work was done that I think feeds into 
the conversation about what we do very 

1320
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:37,470
clearly in order to change the way the 
world functions.

1321
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,753
Most of the mechanisms that have 
fUnctioned in the past are no longer 

1322
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:43,703
viable,
is almost inconceivable to imagine that 

1323
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,353
you could have a revolution in any 
standard sense that would successfully 

1324
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,960
capture power and then wielded wisely.

1325
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,333
I can't even imagine it happening.
So game b is the idea that one needs to 

1326
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,590
create an entity that is capable of 
competing in the market.

1327
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:12,630
It is capable of competing in game a,
his terms and winning against game a,

1328
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,553
so game a is the way things run.
Game b is an alternative that can 

1329
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:23,530
compete in today's terms and when,
and that sounds first time you hear it,

1330
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:24,364
it sounds preposterous because the 
system has so much inertia in it that 

1331
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:31,360
you would think it is completely 
impervious to any challenge,

1332
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:32,733
but there's a hidden factor which I 
think is evident in those various 

1333
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:38,404
examples we were looking at in parker 
and lars anderson and his archery 

1334
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:43,054
innovations and danny macaskill.
I would also say jane goodall and her 

1335
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:51,640
success at sorting out what was going on
with chimps.

1336
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:58,320
The point is systems that become very 
difficult to dislodge,

1337
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:04,870
that have great inertia are almost 
inevitably feeble.

1338
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,960
In a particular fashion,
so this is true of academic disciplines,

1339
01:15:10,181 --> 01:15:11,014
to if a discipline becomes stuck,
it is very hard to get a hearing within 

1340
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:18,514
the discipline,
but the discipline loses track of where 

1341
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:24,724
it has made assumptions that aren't true
or aren't certain and so it becomes 

1342
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:31,100
relatively easy to compete against it.
Uh,

1343
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,770
if you're not requiring it to validate 
your perspective.

1344
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:40,330
So that feebleness is a feature of our 
system.

1345
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:45,690
Our system is delivering the,
the goods to people at a low rate.

1346
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,960
Most people are dissatisfied,
they're unhealthy,

1347
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:53,800
they are not well protected from things 
like bad luck.

1348
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:58,570
ANd those are all problems that can be 
solved by a,

1349
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:02,980
an entity that is capable of 
restructuring the deals between peOple.

1350
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:06,280
In other words,
let's take an obvious one.

1351
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:11,490
Like insurance insurance is not well 
delivered by a market and there's a very

1352
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,234
good reason it isn't,
which is that the strategy for winning 

1353
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:20,620
in the delivery of insurance is 
perfectly obvious.

1354
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:21,783
You want to insure people who need it 
very little and you want to uninsured 

1355
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:27,610
people who needed a lot.
That's how you win the insurance game.

1356
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,610
So the insurance industry is always 
looking to make that deal with the world

1357
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:34,070
and that's always looking to figure out 
how to,

1358
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,110
uh,
to,

1359
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,620
to disengage or those who are most 
likely to need it.

1360
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:42,220
And what that means is that we can't 
provide a risk pool.

1361
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:45,820
The risk pool just means you don't know 
if you're going to get a brain tumor.

1362
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:46,654
I'm going to get a brain tumor.
So how about we both agree to pay for 

1363
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:49,653
whoever's treatment needs it and whoever
has the bad luck wins in that deal and 

1364
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:53,524
whoever has the good luck loses,
but because we don't know who it is 

1365
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,370
ahead of time,
it's a win for both of us,

1366
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,233
right?
So that structure is one that you can 

1367
01:17:00,641 --> 01:17:04,810
build inside of this competitive 
architecture.

1368
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:07,600
And uh,
what I'm,

1369
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,493
what I'm getting at is that the 
conversation of people that has 

1370
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:14,144
coalesced,
people who are discussing the question 

1371
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:17,534
of how to make things function in a way 
that solves the problems that we all 

1372
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:23,640
face,
um,

1373
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,853
without having to win some unimaginable 
electoral victory or to challenge these 

1374
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:32,264
governments outright.
That conversation centers around a game 

1375
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:38,810
theoretic,
um,

1376
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:44,050
insight.
And this is something I mentioned before

1377
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:44,984
that I had participated in occupy and 
had been quite disappointed and really 

1378
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:54,161
where I was before I ran into this 
conversation was I was,

1379
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,023
if I'm honest with myself,
I was becoming a little desperate 

1380
01:17:57,501 --> 01:17:59,690
because I could see how much trouble we 
were in,

1381
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,823
but every mechanism that you might use 
to fix it seemed very unlikely to 

1382
01:18:04,401 --> 01:18:07,460
function.
When I heard a presentation that said,

1383
01:18:07,461 --> 01:18:08,294
actually there's a mechanism that does 
not go through any of the familiar 

1384
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:15,881
historical means,
but uses tools that we all see deployed,

1385
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:22,430
right?
The same tools that caused a facebook to

1386
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:26,510
be successful can be used to repair the 
system.

1387
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,730
That begins to sound plausible to me 
that make any sense

1388
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,240
sort of.
But this is,

1389
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:36,310
we're,
we're on a long road.

1390
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:38,320
Yeah.
Is there a way to boil this down?

1391
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,490
Well,
let's try an example.

1392
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,970
How do you feel about bitcoin?
A?

1393
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,250
I think,
I think it's fascinating.

1394
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:46,810
You wish you had more of it?
Well,

1395
01:18:46,811 --> 01:18:48,190
no,
I have some of it,

1396
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:51,700
but it's not mine.
It's all donated towards a fight for the

1397
01:18:51,701 --> 01:18:53,890
forgotten.
They're building wells in the Congo.

1398
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:55,123
Uh,
I had andreas antonopoulos on and he 

1399
01:18:57,281 --> 01:19:00,580
introduced me to bitcoin,
so he set up a bitcoin wallet for me.

1400
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,340
I took donations from people,
but I didn't think it was right.

1401
01:19:03,341 --> 01:19:05,470
They just gave me,
it was very little at the time,

1402
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,753
but I said I'll just give this to my 
friend justin who builds wells in the 

1403
01:19:10,031 --> 01:19:10,864
Congo.
So now it's worth with it with like 70 

1404
01:19:12,551 --> 01:19:16,720
grand or something like that,
something like that.

1405
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,450
But he's got to figure out when he wants
to cash out.

1406
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,300
It's up to him.
But uh,

1407
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:22,893
so far they've gotten at least 10,000
out of it and we've built a bunch of 

1408
01:19:28,301 --> 01:19:30,940
wells with that money.
So I think it's great in that regard.

1409
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:34,960
It's served an amazing purpose for those
people in the Congo.

1410
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,953
Well,
the people were actually mad at me that 

1411
01:19:37,091 --> 01:19:41,540
I didn't buy those things with bitcoin 
that instead used the,

1412
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:43,020
the acap,
the bitcoin,

1413
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:45,370
but gave him the money value of the 
bitcoin.

1414
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,630
They were upset,
like,

1415
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:48,070
why didn't you just pay for it with 
bitcoin?

1416
01:19:48,071 --> 01:19:48,904
But about,
I wanted to see as an experiment where 

1417
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:51,244
the bitcoin goes and turns out it was a 
lucky guess on my part and now it's 

1418
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:58,780
worth far more because what was worth 
5,000

1419
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,370
at the time is now

1420
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,760
a hundred grand.
Right?

1421
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,950
So we don't all like it.
Okay.

1422
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,680
I like that too.
And whether it's bitcoin or not,

1423
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:11,400
there's something clearly happening in 
the,

1424
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:13,800
uh,
in the blockchain cryptocurrency.

1425
01:20:13,801 --> 01:20:14,740
Yes.
So people,

1426
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:15,733
the world is trying to figure out which,
which of these currencies is going to 

1427
01:20:17,821 --> 01:20:18,654
function at the moment.
It's blockchain is looking the most 

1428
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:23,880
promising.
There are obstacles to add functioning.

1429
01:20:23,881 --> 01:20:28,100
There are ways in which those obstacles 
are being addressed and you know,

1430
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:30,630
It'd be pointless to get into the 
details of it community.

1431
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,240
I really,
I really liked the idea behind it.

1432
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:34,343
To me,
I like things that don't have a whole 

1433
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:40,620
lot of rules where people sort of figure
out what's right.

1434
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:41,970
Right.
Good.

1435
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So if we take 'em bitcoin as an example 
of something that addresses the problems

1436
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,740
of fiat currency,
lIke the dollar,

1437
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,890
nobody asked permission to build it.
In fact,

1438
01:20:55,891 --> 01:20:57,080
we don't even know who innovated it.

1439
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,770
It's a pseudonym that we have.
We don't know whose identity it is.

1440
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,690
recently someone thought it was elon 
musk,

1441
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:06,360
which I would not be surprised.
that crazy guy,

1442
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:07,801
uh,
you know,

1443
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:09,110
I couldn't say,
and I think it,

1444
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:14,180
it doesn't much matter what we know is 
that somebody without asking permission,

1445
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:15,503
found a better model for a currency that
addressed issues that we all face and 

1446
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:25,260
we're not individually capable of 
addressing ourselves.

1447
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,423
And it's pretty clear that a,
something in this realm is going to win 

1448
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:31,410
and it's going to become an important 
player,

1449
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:34,500
if not the important player on the world
stage currency wise.

1450
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:39,830
that is a,
an entity which exists in game a space,

1451
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,690
right?
You can convert bitcoin to dollars.

1452
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:48,240
That's not hard.
Bitcoin functions inside of this realm.

1453
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:50,340
It's not illegal.
It works.

1454
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,293
It's reliable.
The problems had been solved by people 

1455
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:53,874
because solving those problems made 
sense that it enriched them for doing 

1456
01:21:57,721 --> 01:21:57,930
so.

1457
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:00,090
They made their currency more 
functional.

1458
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:05,210
So that entity is a solution that is 
superior to game a,

1459
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,800
but it functions in gamer terms.
It's winning in gay terms at the moment.

1460
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:14,940
Now I'm not saying it isn't going to 
crash.

1461
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:15,774
It probably is going to crash because 
it's probably overinflated at the 

1462
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:19,680
moment.
How much will the crash?

1463
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:20,514
Will it come back?
Are we going to go through repeated 

1464
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:27,240
bubbles and bitcoin will still went out.
I don't nobody clearly nobody knows,

1465
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,583
but the idea that it is a superior 
solution invented inside this other 

1466
01:22:33,271 --> 01:22:38,100
system that is winning against the 
dollar at the moment.

1467
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:42,000
That's a fine example.
Likewise,

1468
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:45,480
you could use wikipedia as a fine 
example.

1469
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:49,110
This is an entity that is functioning 
inside.

1470
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:52,800
It is competing with the old 
encyclopedias that is competing with for

1471
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,280
profit services that would deliver 
information and uh,

1472
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,920
frankly it's winning because it's 
superior.

1473
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,330
It was a perfect no,
but,

1474
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:01,650
um,
but it's a,

1475
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,543
it's a demonstration that you can do 
things inside this space that in fact 

1476
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,960
have reorganized our relationship to 
information.

1477
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:12,370
And in fact,
uh,

1478
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:17,050
in a way that we don't typically 
acknowledge is challenging the,

1479
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,240
the academy.
I mean,

1480
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:20,074
maybe part of why the academy was so 
feeble at the point that this social 

1481
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:27,160
justice madness started to challenge it 
had to do with the fact that without the

1482
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:30,910
academy's permission,
information became free.

1483
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:32,613
The fact that everybody,
there was a level playing field for 

1484
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:34,963
information meant that the academy 
needed to figure out what it was going 

1485
01:23:38,871 --> 01:23:39,704
to deliver on top of that information 
and it didn't figure it out and I would 

1486
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,260
say there was an obvious answer which it
missed.

1487
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,990
It needed to deliver stuff that didn't 
scale.

1488
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,030
It needed to teach,
um,

1489
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,273
insight and critical thinking and how to
wield that information properly rather 

1490
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:54,064
than continuing to deliver textbook 
level information when effectively 

1491
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,120
textbooks are obsolete.

1492
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,310
Um,
but these are,

1493
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,900
these are examples of successful 
competitivelY successful,

1494
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,730
innovative challenges to the model that 
preexisted them.

1495
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:11,303
And the question is,
can that set of models be systematized 

1496
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:18,130
so that it,
um,

1497
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,083
without having to do the impossible,
simply replaces the system as it stands 

1498
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:25,744
because it delivers the things to the 
system claims to deliver more 

1499
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:30,170
successfully than the system delivers.
Okay.

1500
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:31,004
Like what things are we talking about?
We're talking about insulation from bad 

1501
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:38,734
luck.
Luck is a tremendously negative 

1502
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:43,090
influence,
so like insurance,

1503
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:43,983
but ensuring that we collectively 
utilize correct something that we 

1504
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:51,550
collectively utilized.
So imagine that you could have wonderful

1505
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:52,384
insurance,
but that in signing up for that 

1506
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:55,564
insurance,
you were agreeing to some sort of a 

1507
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,833
larger social entity,
so like your taxes would go towards a 

1508
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:06,160
life insurance,
but meaning like things that go wrong in

1509
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:06,994
life,
like some part of what you would spend 

1510
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:13,300
on things would be attributed to this 
fund.

1511
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:14,530
Yeah.
Um,

1512
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:15,364
and,
uh,

1513
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,233
it's,
I think we unfortunately default to 

1514
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:20,440
thinking of everything in monetary 
terms.

1515
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:24,690
You could also invest in such an entity.
Let you know.

1516
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:27,740
Let's talk about the question of 
teachers that you were pointing out.

1517
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:30,910
Why are good teachers so few and far 
between?

1518
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,833
Well,
of course we pay at a level that we get 

1519
01:25:33,821 --> 01:25:34,654
exactly what we ordered and you know,
the few good teachers that we run into 

1520
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:38,374
are by and large people who are doing it
in spite of the fact that they're being 

1521
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:45,220
economically penalized for doing it.
But what if your,

1522
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,680
um,
your insurance,

1523
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:48,514
your access to excellent insurance that 
correctly hedged out the danger of bad 

1524
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:53,284
medical,
bad luck came with some sort of social 

1525
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:59,080
obligation in which,
you know,

1526
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:00,723
I don't know,
the three years after you had gone to 

1527
01:26:03,051 --> 01:26:03,884
graduate school and gotten your advanced
degree in something you spent teaching 

1528
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:07,544
in some school that needed that so you 
didn't sideline yourself from the 

1529
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:11,654
economy for the rest of your life 
teaching in some school where you were 

1530
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:17,270
forever going to be hobbled by bad 
administrators,

1531
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,870
but you decided to take some period of 
time and invested in,

1532
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,793
uh,
your community or somebody else's 

1533
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:25,200
community using expertise that,
um,

1534
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:28,160
that you got that you'll be highly paid 
for later.

1535
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:33,080
So it's almost like you have mandatory 
military service manager.

1536
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:36,020
It mandatory military service is,
yes,

1537
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:36,854
it is one version of a much larger space
of potential agreements that you could 

1538
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:45,140
sign up for an exchange for benefits 
that you can't.

1539
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:48,830
Most of us cannot negotiate on the open 
market.

1540
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:50,080
So,
uh,

1541
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,193
to get your education,
you would agree to use that education 

1542
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,710
for the good of the community for a 
certain amount of time.

1543
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:59,360
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1544
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:00,194
So instead of walking away with massive 
debt that is going to hobble you in 

1545
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:07,034
economic terms as you're trying to,
to find your niche that you would sign 

1546
01:27:10,821 --> 01:27:12,980
up for some agreement that was,
you know,

1547
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,340
but wouldn't that still benefit the 
elite?

1548
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:20,290
Because what of scrooge mcduck has a kid
and scrooge mcduck kid,

1549
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:22,780
uh,
he pays for his kids education.

1550
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:23,623
I listened,
son,

1551
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,150
you're not going to do any service which
are going to do is use those three years

1552
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:26,960
to get ahead.

1553
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,090
And those little fox,
when they get out of that service,

1554
01:27:29,091 --> 01:27:31,120
I've got to be working for you.
Ha.

1555
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,710
They throw the gold coins up in the air.
Right?

1556
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,040
So this is another place,
a nice look.

1557
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:45,040
This is another place where two things 
are fused together that we need to tease

1558
01:27:45,081 --> 01:27:45,914
apart.
Okay?

1559
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:49,100
I'm trying to remember.
I think Eric May have actually said this

1560
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:50,570
on your podcast.
I'm,

1561
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,430
if he didn't,
he said it elsewhere,

1562
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,930
but elites is not a good category,
right?

1563
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:00,950
Elites takes two things that don't 
belong together and it decides that they

1564
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:01,784
are one.
And so the scrooge mcduck thing becomes 

1565
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:10,580
it blocks the other thing we want people
to innovate.

1566
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:16,120
And one of the reasons that equality of 
outcome is absolutely not desirable,

1567
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:21,320
even if you could arrange it,
is that the inequality of outcome is the

1568
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:22,154
incentive that drives people to achieve 
amazing stuff that we want them to 

1569
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:25,710
achieve.

1570
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:26,543
Right?
Of course.

1571
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:31,070
So how far ahead of everybody else 
should you end up?

1572
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,143
Well,
this is a difficult problem because you 

1573
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:38,540
to the extent that somebody earns a 
fortune because they've,

1574
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,780
um,
they have innovated in a,

1575
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:42,614
in an important way,
but then they have gone on to be a rent 

1576
01:28:45,201 --> 01:28:47,960
seeker.
We don't want them re rewarded for their

1577
01:28:47,961 --> 01:28:48,794
rent seeking,
but we do want them rewarded for their 

1578
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:51,070
innovation.
Um,

1579
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,363
so there,
the problem is the elite is two 

1580
01:28:56,871 --> 01:29:01,871
different things and even worse 
individuals are members of the elite are

1581
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,013
composites of both things where you get 
into the elite because you innovated 

1582
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:09,384
something amazing.
But the degree to which you had been 

1583
01:29:11,581 --> 01:29:13,650
rewarded is,
I dunno,

1584
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:15,090
60,
70 percent,

1585
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,260
the result of rent seeking rather than 
what you innovate.

1586
01:29:18,261 --> 01:29:19,080
It meant,
again,

1587
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,930
for people who are just tuning into us 
now rent seeking meaning,

1588
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:26,520
doing things to which you extract money 
from the system without any real benefit

1589
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:27,690
to the people that are around you.

1590
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,593
Yeah.
It's anytime that you get paid without 

1591
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:35,340
producing something of value,
either innovation or productivity itself

1592
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:37,800
or something like that.
But how would you regulate that?

1593
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:38,634
How would you,
how would you figure out a way to 

1594
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:43,980
regulate the amount of profit that 
someone could like if you have a system,

1595
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:44,843
right?
And if you build something and then you 

1596
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:46,950
get,
you know,

1597
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:47,783
some sort of a residual benefit from 
that system because you built it and so 

1598
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:51,354
you're not really doing anything but 
you're just constantly collecting money 

1599
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:54,204
from this thing.
How would you stop that or regulate 

1600
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:57,480
that?
Well,

1601
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:58,950
as aN example of it,
what I just,

1602
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:00,900
the way I just described it,
yeah,

1603
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,700
it's,
it's a pretty good example.

1604
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,371
um,
you know,

1605
01:30:03,371 --> 01:30:04,204
we do want.
So it's a very tough conversation 

1606
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:08,724
because one has to be very careful that 
you don't remove an incentive to do 

1607
01:30:13,261 --> 01:30:14,094
something valuable,
even though the value of it may be very 

1608
01:30:17,191 --> 01:30:17,640
subtle.

1609
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,473
So the example of investment like 
playing the stock market might look on 

1610
01:30:24,381 --> 01:30:25,214
productive,
but to the extent that you are 

1611
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:27,294
correcting the fact that certain things 
are undervalued and other things are 

1612
01:30:29,821 --> 01:30:30,654
overvalued,
you're actually doing a kind of service 

1613
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:33,383
that is not as obvious on the outsIde 
unless you've spent time thinking about 

1614
01:30:36,961 --> 01:30:39,480
the logic of why you want the market to 
be efficient.

1615
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:41,580
Um,
so I don't want to,

1616
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:42,900
I don't want to,
uh,

1617
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,123
declare that certain things are In and 
of themselves bad because we can't see 

1618
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:50,460
the obvious value of them.
On the other hand,

1619
01:30:50,461 --> 01:30:51,294
there's an awful lot of stuff that is 
either totally valueless for which 

1620
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:57,450
people are very handsomely paid or 
worse.

1621
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,430
Um,
counterproductive.

1622
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:01,410
Destructive of value,
right?

1623
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:02,244
If,
if you take waste and you get paid to 

1624
01:31:05,191 --> 01:31:06,024
dispose of it and you dispose of it in a
way that it creates cancers where you 

1625
01:31:09,361 --> 01:31:12,030
can't detect that they have been created
by what you've done.

1626
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:14,490
But it's not that you solved the problem
of that waste,

1627
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:18,480
you just caused cancers in random homes 
that won't be able to trace their,

1628
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:21,510
their misfortune to your action.
That's not,

1629
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,720
not only is that unproductive,
but it's counterproductive.

1630
01:31:24,721 --> 01:31:29,490
It's harmful.
So how do you address these questions?

1631
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:32,640
Well,
a you.

1632
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,253
this is a much harder problem if you 
imagine that what you want to do is fix 

1633
01:31:38,401 --> 01:31:39,234
the landscape that you're walking into 
and say you're a rent seeker and you're 

1634
01:31:42,001 --> 01:31:44,850
productive and you're 30 percent 
productive,

1635
01:31:44,851 --> 01:31:47,970
but 70 percent of rent secret,
nobody believes you can do that.

1636
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:52,080
What you can do is restructure things so
that going forward,

1637
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:57,260
what is rewarded is actual productivity 
that is not harmful or actual innovation

1638
01:31:58,291 --> 01:31:59,950
that is not harmful

1639
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:03,940
and what is panelized and what you 
really want.

1640
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:05,530
if you,
if the system is to function,

1641
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:07,173
what you want is a disincentIve to do 
anything that hurts other people that 

1642
01:32:11,681 --> 01:32:16,681
has a net negative impact on the system.
The bp oil spill,

1643
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:20,230
bp oil spill,
the aliso canyon,

1644
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:25,580
a leak the mile island,
three mile island fukushima 10th degree.

1645
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,153
So how do you.
I'm still confused as to what's 

1646
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:31,180
different,
like what's going on here?

1647
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,950
Um,
what is going on is that if you,

1648
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,193
if you array incentives so that at the 
point you have solved a problem that is 

1649
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:44,133
good to solve,
that the wellbeing starts flowing in 

1650
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:49,780
your direction.
You made it perfect widget.

1651
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,010
Everybody goes,
oh my god,

1652
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:52,990
this fixes my life.
Right?

1653
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:54,850
I love this widget.
So by a bunch of them,

1654
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:56,330
you start,
you start bawling,

1655
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,740
get Paul Wall grill.
Exactly.

1656
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:03,700
Exactly.
But as you start moving in the direction

1657
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:06,610
of doing something that interferes with 
other people's wellbeing,

1658
01:33:06,611 --> 01:33:08,110
but nonetheless they can't help 
themselves.

1659
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:12,400
If you're innovating how to addict 
people to their phone,

1660
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:15,940
then actually you're hurting people and 
we don't want you to do that.

1661
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:18,310
Now it's very hard again,
are you going to tell facebook?

1662
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:23,550
You know what it's allowed to study and 
also people that have good intentions,

1663
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:27,250
but it turns out that they're like,
facebook is a perfect example.

1664
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:30,580
One of the executives from facebook,
I was just reading on dig the other day.

1665
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,170
There was an article,
uh,

1666
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:35,740
where he was sorry for what they've 
done.

1667
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:37,450
It was one of the original guys from 
facebook.

1668
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:38,284
it's like,
I really think that we've done a 

1669
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:42,070
terrible thing with facebook and we've 
made people addicted to social media.

1670
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,233
Facebook is seems to me to be 
particularly addictive and I'm not 

1671
01:33:46,511 --> 01:33:48,850
exactly sure what they've done different
than anybody else,

1672
01:33:48,851 --> 01:33:51,580
but so much so that I kind of avoid 
facebook,

1673
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:52,713
you know,
it's funny how many conversations I've 

1674
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:54,544
had in the last month in which somebody 
has said that they're avoiding facebook 

1675
01:33:56,971 --> 01:33:57,804
and including me.

1676
01:33:57,860 --> 01:33:58,693
I like instagram because I just see 
pictures and they look pretty and 

1677
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,570
simple.
well,

1678
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:05,621
yeah,
I mean,

1679
01:34:05,621 --> 01:34:08,050
each of these things has their,
uh,

1680
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:09,850
their value.
I'm not on instagram.

1681
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:12,370
I'm on twitter.
I'm on twitter too.

1682
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:13,241
full.
For me,

1683
01:34:13,241 --> 01:34:14,520
what's good about it is this,
it,

1684
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:16,690
you're being programmed former facebook 
executive.

1685
01:34:16,691 --> 01:34:19,150
Warren's for me,
for my business,

1686
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,220
it's very important to let people,
hey,

1687
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:26,221
bret weinstein is going to be on today.
As I said it right earlier,

1688
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:33,330
bret weinstein is going to be on today.
People tune in and you know,

1689
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:36,280
now there's people that are listening 
right now because of social media.

1690
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,450
Right?
And then,

1691
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:39,220
you know,
comedy shows that I have coming out,

1692
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:41,980
but it works for me and a lot of those 
ways.

1693
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:46,981
But as time has gone on,
I've pushed it away and most otherwIse.

1694
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,720
Well,
and the thing,

1695
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:50,320
the,
the,

1696
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:54,470
the interview that you just referenced,
I saw it too and was quite blown away by

1697
01:34:54,471 --> 01:34:55,120
it.
Um,

1698
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,220
I've been tuned into that because 
tristan harris is a friend

1699
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,860
of mine and tristan harris is sort of 
the,

1700
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:01,694
uh,
the paul revere on this issue who has 

1701
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,903
pointed out how much danger we are 
actually in and I must say he's a very 

1702
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:13,391
interesting guy because his,
his other area of expertise is magic.

1703
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:16,640
And so he's very interested in.
Yeah,

1704
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:18,020
exactly.
Interesting.

1705
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:18,910
And so anyway,
he's,

1706
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:21,470
he's watched as an insider,
as these,

1707
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:22,443
uh,
economic goliath have conspired to not 

1708
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:30,041
let us go and to turn their product from
a facilitator of social interaction into

1709
01:35:30,081 --> 01:35:30,980
a cigarette,
which is,

1710
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,873
you know,
or a slot machine or something like 

1711
01:35:33,411 --> 01:35:34,244
that.
Um,

1712
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,350
but,
uh,

1713
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:37,923
the,
how would you penalize them then say if 

1714
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:42,790
there's this new system,
how would that work?

1715
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:46,390
Say if you came up with this new widget 
and this new widget does amazing things,

1716
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:50,440
but turns out it also makes you addicted
to widgets.

1717
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:53,400
Okay,
so I'm speaking only for myself here.

1718
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:57,120
I would not penalize facebook or 
twitter,

1719
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:57,983
but what I would want to see is somebody
generate the alternative that has the 

1720
01:36:03,151 --> 01:36:04,860
benefit of not doing that.

1721
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,550
Okay,
so a new facebook that doesn't work with

1722
01:36:08,551 --> 01:36:09,384
likes and all these things are.
You're not constantly checking in the 

1723
01:36:11,531 --> 01:36:12,780
likes,
but it wouldn't be.

1724
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,673
Here's the thing.
It wouldn't be a successful people love 

1725
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:16,644
likes.
That's why girls stick their butt out 

1726
01:36:17,341 --> 01:36:19,440
and those pictures,
they want to get those likes.

1727
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:24,441
That's what that's all about it is that 
they've said first of all,

1728
01:36:26,401 --> 01:36:29,520
that people that do that,
you know what those things are called,

1729
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:32,340
which things.
When girls stick their butt out and they

1730
01:36:32,341 --> 01:36:35,130
have traps,
thirst traps,

1731
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,150
yeah,
you don't know about that.

1732
01:36:36,151 --> 01:36:40,350
I don't know about thirst traps.
I'm going to tell you,

1733
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:43,890
thirst traps are you look for people 
that are thirsty.

1734
01:36:43,891 --> 01:36:44,850
They were like,
ooh girl,

1735
01:36:44,851 --> 01:36:46,260
you look good.
Damn.

1736
01:36:46,261 --> 01:36:49,020
You look good.
People who are like extra thirsty,

1737
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:53,730
thirsty means you never get thirsty.
Okay.

1738
01:36:53,731 --> 01:36:54,564
You're married,
you've been around intellectuals and 

1739
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,760
trapped up in progressive pacific 
northwest.

1740
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:01,950
You're not going to embarrass their 
friend.

1741
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:02,813
No,
don't worry.

1742
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:07,680
Is thirsty is people who are trying too 
hard,

1743
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,713
like like you're not the type person.
If you saw someone who is a beautiful 

1744
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:13,710
girl who was in a bikini,
you would say,

1745
01:37:13,711 --> 01:37:16,230
wow,
that is a beautiful girl in a bikini and

1746
01:37:16,231 --> 01:37:18,210
what an incredible body she has and you 
would move on.

1747
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,370
You wouldn't be like,
damn girl,

1748
01:37:20,371 --> 01:37:24,090
you look so fun.
How can I get what you did?

1749
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,310
You would be super thirsty,
right?

1750
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:28,920
That would be thursday.
So I'm trying too hard.

1751
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,193
But the internet is filled with thirsty 
people and so a lot of these girls 

1752
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:39,960
become famous.
There's girls that you've never heard of

1753
01:37:39,961 --> 01:37:40,830
them.
Okay.

1754
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:41,783
I had a bit about it and yeah,
my last special about there was a girl 

1755
01:37:44,971 --> 01:37:45,661
that I,
she,

1756
01:37:45,661 --> 01:37:46,494
all she does is take pictures of her,
but and at the time she had 7 million 

1757
01:37:50,191 --> 01:37:52,560
followers now,
but she's got 100 million or something.

1758
01:37:52,561 --> 01:37:56,100
I don't know,
but that these people become

1759
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:57,743
these,
these places where everybody goes to 

1760
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:01,374
stare at their butt and these pictures 
of them and their bodies and all these 

1761
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:06,594
different things are traps for all these
weird people that lack normal social 

1762
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:17,250
skills and their uber thirsty.
A thirst trap.

1763
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,173
Okay,
well this.

1764
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:19,463
That's the whole reason why these people
use things like instagram and she that 

1765
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:26,430
thirst trap had a thirst trap on 
instagram with cardi,

1766
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:27,510
b,
c,

1767
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:28,651
c,
I'm ty.

1768
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:32,250
I'm talking about the kids today.
This girl,

1769
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:34,440
I'm beginning to think maybe we can't 
save the world,

1770
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:36,090
but listen,
we can save the world,

1771
01:38:36,091 --> 01:38:36,924
but the problem is we have to be 
cognizant of normal human desires and 

1772
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,810
like the the traps thirst traps.
Okay,

1773
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:46,703
so this is actually the perfect place to
go then because one of the biggest 

1774
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:50,963
obstacles to fixing the world is that 
although a huge fraction of the 

1775
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:56,124
population is actually aware that things
are off and they would like it to be 

1776
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:00,564
better,
there's so much low level stuff that 

1777
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:03,774
keeps us trapped in these unproductive 
kinds of cycles and one of the things 

1778
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:10,794
that I keep running into now,
I'm now being included in all of these 

1779
01:39:13,561 --> 01:39:18,561
conversations with folks who do aspire 
to something better,

1780
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:20,693
but everybody,
and I mean really just about everybody 

1781
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:28,350
has stuff that to them is sacred and 
they want to take it off the table.

1782
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:29,340
Right?
They,

1783
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,173
they,
they're very interested in the 

1784
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:32,520
conversation about how we might fix the 
world,

1785
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:34,820
but you know,
if they're a libertarian,

1786
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:35,673
the point is as soon as you.
You can't even finish the word regulate 

1787
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:39,930
and they're just like,
oh,

1788
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:40,764
well,
sorry.

1789
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,480
Who?
Who watches the watchers?

1790
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:44,543
And the point that it's a bitter pill 
for just about everybody who's got some 

1791
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:53,601
sacred thing that they're holding onto 
is you are.

1792
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:55,223
If we deploy something that functions 
well and is capable of replacing the 

1793
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:01,254
system,
we have without some gigantic 

1794
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:07,440
catastrophe necessary in order to get 
over the transition.

1795
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:12,780
The whole point is to everyone's net 
benefit,

1796
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,213
right?
If liberty is your thing and I'm 

1797
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:19,890
virtually sure liberty is your thing,
as it is my thing,

1798
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:22,403
that you will get more liberty net 
liberty will go up in a system that 

1799
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:30,960
functions well.
Many of the things that caused us not to

1800
01:40:30,961 --> 01:40:34,290
be free have nothing to do with 
governmental regulation.

1801
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:35,123
They have to do with expectations that 
have been created by a market that does 

1802
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:39,774
not have our interests at heart,
and so if you're tracking net liberty 

1803
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:46,200
than a system that functions well 
liberates you.

1804
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,100
It may have more regulation in it than 
the one we currently have,

1805
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:55,210
but that regulation is liberating rather
oppressing and so anyway,

1806
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:56,053
with libertarians,
getting them to imagine to wrap their 

1807
01:41:00,671 --> 01:41:04,150
minds around the possibility of 
regulation that they wouldn't hate.

1808
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,373
They're there.
So we are all so experienced now living 

1809
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:12,370
in a world of malignant government where
government,

1810
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:18,450
government action almost can't be useful
and so it is natural to rebel against it

1811
01:41:19,601 --> 01:41:21,190
and say,
I don't want any more of that.

1812
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:24,970
The less the better because the actions 
tend to be predatory,

1813
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,073
but that is not the inherent nature of 
regulation and so constructing a set of 

1814
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:32,434
incentives that caused the market to 
deliver you the good parts of what a 

1815
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:37,204
phone does without secretly addicting 
you to something that you know we now 

1816
01:41:42,371 --> 01:41:42,700
know.

1817
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:47,020
I mean I don't know how many people in 
silicon valley have now issued a note of

1818
01:41:47,021 --> 01:41:50,230
caution,
but there are many have switched to flip

1819
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:51,850
phones themselves.
They have,

1820
01:41:51,851 --> 01:41:55,450
I mean this is.
This is nature's way of telling you that

1821
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:58,420
these algorithms have escaped our 
control.

1822
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,433
The fact that the people who are in a 
position to make a phone call and no 

1823
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,620
more or less what the algorithm does,
can't even protect themselves,

1824
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:06,943
ought to.
That ought to set off warning bells for 

1825
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:09,550
us.
Right?

1826
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,443
Those people are in the best position to
protect themselves and the fact that 

1827
01:42:12,371 --> 01:42:13,204
they are bending over backwards there 
they are externalizing decision making 

1828
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:18,514
power.
They're having their secretaries tell 

1829
01:42:19,421 --> 01:42:23,170
them when they can interact with certain
sites in order to keep them from getting

1830
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:26,530
into habits that they can't manage.
This is,

1831
01:42:26,531 --> 01:42:28,180
this is the only warning we're going to 
get.

1832
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:31,270
This was bad.
We could still do something about it,

1833
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:33,580
but this is only getting more 
sophisticated.

1834
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:36,820
And so if we do want to restructure 
things,

1835
01:42:36,821 --> 01:42:41,680
and I would argue that even though I'm 
market fundamentalists will,

1836
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:42,514
you know,
hear their little sacred sacred thing 

1837
01:42:44,171 --> 01:42:45,004
being challenged,
what we really want to do is free 

1838
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:48,693
markets to do what the brochure says 
that they do while eliminating what the 

1839
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:55,570
brochure never mentioned.
The brochure.

1840
01:42:55,571 --> 01:42:56,404
It doesn't mention the fact that a 
totally free market produces predators 

1841
01:43:01,391 --> 01:43:04,450
and parasites at a huge rate,
right?

1842
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:05,980
It doesn't have to.
We can.

1843
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:07,293
We can structure things such that a 
predator is not viable so that it a 

1844
01:43:10,181 --> 01:43:13,180
predator has nothing to eat and if the 
predator has nothing to eat,

1845
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:15,220
the habitat won't have them.
Right?

1846
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:20,760
So that is the perspective that all of 
us,

1847
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,630
if we would do that,
it's,

1848
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:24,400
this is,
these are abstract ideas,

1849
01:43:24,401 --> 01:43:24,970
right?

1850
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:27,160
How would we,
how would we eliminate predators?

1851
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:29,470
Um,
how would we eliminate predators?

1852
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,950
You would eliminate predators by a 
disincentive.

1853
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:41,160
So your question actually has a,
a hidden assumption built into it.

1854
01:43:42,011 --> 01:43:42,844
You've seen the market as a mature 
entity with lots of full grown 

1855
01:43:47,051 --> 01:43:49,420
predators,
but just as it is with biology,

1856
01:43:49,421 --> 01:43:52,910
all of those predators started with 
something simple.

1857
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:58,330
And what happened was they tapped into a
niche and because that niche was allowed

1858
01:44:00,861 --> 01:44:02,690
to exist,
um,

1859
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:03,643
the predators grow and they get more and
more sophisticated at doing what they 

1860
01:44:07,271 --> 01:44:09,980
are doing.
If you don't want to see the predators,

1861
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:10,993
you eliminate the niche for predation.
This sounds like it would be functional 

1862
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,390
with if there was like 100 people.
Well,

1863
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:18,224
first of all,
this is one of the primary questions in 

1864
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:21,403
the various conversations where people 
are trying to figure out how to 

1865
01:44:23,751 --> 01:44:24,584
bootstrap such a thing,
is that we have what's called dunbar's 

1866
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:29,160
number and numbers.

1867
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:34,160
Numbers basically a limit in the low 
hundreds of how many people you can keep

1868
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:35,270
in your head.
Right?

1869
01:44:35,271 --> 01:44:36,104
And so the point is we are,
we are adapted to that and that number 

1870
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:39,314
is probably an indicator of something 
like the number of people that you can 

1871
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:46,820
adaptively interact with.
I mean in other words,

1872
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,673
if you had,
I mean this was really the motivation 

1873
01:44:50,271 --> 01:44:53,240
for your question.
If you had 150 people and somebody was a

1874
01:44:53,241 --> 01:44:54,074
bad actor,
their reputation would proceed them and 

1875
01:44:56,361 --> 01:44:57,194
you would,
you would detect I should be careful 

1876
01:44:58,371 --> 01:45:02,240
interacting with that person so that the
structure would be set up for tribes,

1877
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,193
which is essentially how we evolve.
That's what dunbar's number essentially 

1878
01:45:05,871 --> 01:45:09,710
reveals is that we evolve growing up in 
groups of,

1879
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,013
you know,
50 to a couple hundred people and those 

1880
01:45:13,131 --> 01:45:15,500
are the amount of people that you can 
keep in your mind.

1881
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:16,340
Right?

1882
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:19,670
So hard drive space.
Essentially we do,

1883
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,533
but we also,
human beings are very good at taking a 

1884
01:45:25,311 --> 01:45:30,311
technological solution and kludging or 
hacking a,

1885
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:33,710
a remedy for a problem like that.
So for example,

1886
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,753
you on board in your mind have the 
ability to track something like 150 

1887
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:39,463
individuals with respect to their 
reputation so that you know how much to 

1888
01:45:42,561 --> 01:45:45,410
trust in any given interaction in a 
group of,

1889
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,650
you know,
1500,

1890
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:49,370
you don't.
On the other hand,

1891
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,930
reputation can accumulate in some way 
that you can check it through people who

1892
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:57,620
you know,
so people whose reputations are directly

1893
01:45:57,621 --> 01:46:00,220
known to you are capable of giving you a
reference and in fact you,

1894
01:46:00,221 --> 01:46:03,800
you know that this works because I'm 
interpersonally.

1895
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:07,070
If somebody you trusted to a great 
extent,

1896
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:09,260
gave you a recommendation of somebody 
else,

1897
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:11,180
you would,
you would know how to evaluate it.

1898
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:17,230
So we are unfortunately for for both 
better and worse,

1899
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,433
we are living in a technological 
landscape that doesn't look like 

1900
01:46:21,111 --> 01:46:21,944
anything that our ancestors faced that 
provides mechanisms for building 

1901
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:31,723
solutions to problems that in an 
ancestral environment would not have 

1902
01:46:35,151 --> 01:46:35,900
been possible.

1903
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,733
And this is not new.
I mean the library at alexandria is a 

1904
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:44,000
technological solution to the problem of
Information.

1905
01:46:44,001 --> 01:46:44,834
having expanded to a level of the human 
mind couldn't hold it and ironically 

1906
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,940
burned down by ideologues.
Well sure.

1907
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:52,770
I mean that's,
you know.

1908
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,860
Yeah.
So you have to build a structure that is

1909
01:46:55,861 --> 01:46:56,694
robust to challenge and have all of the 
things that would have to be true for a 

1910
01:46:59,821 --> 01:47:02,190
replacement system,
for,

1911
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,083
for planet earth.
The the key is understanding that there 

1912
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:09,960
are certain values that all reasonable 
people agree on it.

1913
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:10,803
In fact,
you can use to diagnose who's 

1914
01:47:12,061 --> 01:47:12,894
reasonable.

1915
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:16,040
So assuming that we don't all start at 
the same starting point,

1916
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:16,903
right?
Whether it's from our cognitive ability 

1917
01:47:19,341 --> 01:47:23,780
or education or opportunities,
how would you stop predators?

1918
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,810
How would you stop people from preying 
on the weak?

1919
01:47:26,811 --> 01:47:27,644
How would you stop like.
because there are predators who they 

1920
01:47:31,161 --> 01:47:34,310
themselves are unfortunate.
Mentally.

1921
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:35,533
They themselves have a deficit of 
thinking and we're dealing with such 

1922
01:47:39,681 --> 01:47:40,514
numbers when we're dealing with 300 and 
whatever million people we have in this 

1923
01:47:43,551 --> 01:47:46,850
country alone.
There's plenty of dummies that you could

1924
01:47:46,851 --> 01:47:47,410
pray on.

1925
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:48,243
Well,
the first thing that you would want to 

1926
01:47:49,031 --> 01:47:54,031
do is you would want to build.
So if you came to me and you said I have

1927
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:55,023
a social network and it provides 85 
percent of the functionality of 

1928
01:47:59,831 --> 01:48:00,664
facebook,
but it insulates you completely from a 

1929
01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:07,690
dopamine traps being used to it.
Dick dicked you,

1930
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:09,770
I'd sign up in a sec.
Okay.

1931
01:48:09,771 --> 01:48:10,560
Right,
right.

1932
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,393
But you are an intellectual and you are 
rare in that regard that you're worried 

1933
01:48:15,601 --> 01:48:16,434
about this.
These people that are in silicon valley 

1934
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,073
that are talking about the dangers of 
the things that they've created 

1935
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:22,470
themselves.
They're rare.

1936
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,810
Most people are like,
look at all the likes,

1937
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:26,733
dislikes.

1938
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:28,480
Well,
but okay,

1939
01:48:28,481 --> 01:48:30,250
so there's some sort of bored at work,
right?

1940
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:32,320
In one check their likes.
Yes.

1941
01:48:32,321 --> 01:48:33,810
But I mean mike's right,
but pIck,

1942
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,000
that's what a lot of it.
You must have a nice butt.

1943
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:38,940
My butt's not bad.
Um,

1944
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:41,380
but the,
uh,

1945
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:47,040
first of all things spread in waves and 
you know,

1946
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,460
it is possible to just look at the 
landscape and say,

1947
01:48:51,461 --> 01:48:52,294
well yeah,
only intellectuals are gonna get why 

1948
01:48:54,071 --> 01:48:55,900
they should want such a thing.
But it's really,

1949
01:48:55,901 --> 01:48:56,920
it's not accurate.
I mean,

1950
01:48:56,921 --> 01:48:57,754
for one thing,
the world is talking about blockchain 

1951
01:48:59,441 --> 01:49:00,080
currency.

1952
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,600
The world is not talking about 
blockchain currency.

1953
01:49:02,601 --> 01:49:05,750
A very small percentage of the world is 
talk about blockchain currency,

1954
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,420
the same amount that it talked about,
the earth being flat.

1955
01:49:10,150 --> 01:49:12,280
I don't think that's right,
but I bet it is,

1956
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,833
but I would say I grant your point in 
that it's not a huge percentage of 

1957
01:49:16,781 --> 01:49:18,550
people who are talking about blockchain 
currency,

1958
01:49:18,551 --> 01:49:22,000
but it's enough that on the network news
people are talking about blockchain.

1959
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:23,043
Is it a bubble?
So it is beginning to penetrate the 

1960
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:28,503
public consciousness and it is 
penetrating it because people have to 

1961
01:49:31,571 --> 01:49:36,571
navigate lives in which economic 
fluctuation jeopardize us them,

1962
01:49:36,731 --> 01:49:39,010
and so there's an incentive if there's 
something over there.

1963
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,740
Blockchain is not a.
It's not a joke anymore.

1964
01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:43,570
Do you think that blockchain

1965
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:48,190
people that are involved,
interested in comprehensively understand

1966
01:49:48,191 --> 01:49:49,024
what blockchain is?
Are there more or less of them than 

1967
01:49:52,751 --> 01:49:53,770
people that are in cults?

1968
01:49:56,240 --> 01:50:00,410
There are vastly more paying attention 
then people in cults.

1969
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:02,300
Well,
what do you have to default?

1970
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:07,130
That's way off because I think there's 
like a billion catholics.

1971
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:08,990
Well,
if you're gonna call catholicism.

1972
01:50:08,991 --> 01:50:11,420
I grew up in it.
Okay.

1973
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:14,030
A hundred percent.
It's just a coat with a billion people.

1974
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:17,210
Whenever you got a guy who dresses like 
a wizard,

1975
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,670
he's sitting on a golden throne.
Oh boy.

1976
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:21,913
That's,
that's.

1977
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:22,893
But that is why this is a problem,
is that there's many people that live 

1978
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:31,621
their lives by these ridiculous 
ideologies that are illogical.

1979
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:34,880
Okay,
so I'm going,

1980
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:39,440
I'm gonna challenge you on this tech 
them from predators and facebook likes.

1981
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:41,580
I'm going to challenge you on that.
Swedes do.

1982
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:44,570
Catholicism is not a cult.
What is the difference between a cult?

1983
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:46,700
Here's,
I had a bit for my act.

1984
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,593
Let me just make sure a call is bullshit
and it's created by one person and he 

1985
01:50:51,951 --> 01:50:55,460
knows it's bullshit in a religion.
That guy's dead.

1986
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:57,953
Okay,

1987
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:00,220
so let me.
This is,

1988
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:01,710
boy,
this is rough territory,

1989
01:51:01,711 --> 01:51:02,990
but for you.
Okay.

1990
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:05,820
Let's say this is every let's say.
Yeah.

1991
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,490
Let's say moses comes down the mountain 
with the tablets.

1992
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:09,330
Oh,
that dude.

1993
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:10,163
Okay.
I don't know if moses did come down the 

1994
01:51:11,071 --> 01:51:12,360
mountain with the tablets.
Don't think he did.

1995
01:51:12,361 --> 01:51:13,350
Let's say you did.
Okay.

1996
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:14,310
Um,
did he,

1997
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:16,010
did he know he was bullshitting people?
Well,

1998
01:51:16,011 --> 01:51:16,340
do you know

1999
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:17,470
religious scholars?
Actually,

2000
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:20,330
believe in jerusalem,
actually believe that was all about now.

2001
01:51:20,331 --> 01:51:23,360
The whole burning bush tell me they 
believe in is the acacia butch,

2002
01:51:23,361 --> 01:51:24,194
which is rich and dmt,
and they think the metaphor of the 

2003
01:51:27,051 --> 01:51:27,884
burning bush was actually a psychedelic 
experience and that moses during this 

2004
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:32,474
psychedelic dmt experience came back 
from the other dimension that you go 

2005
01:51:35,481 --> 01:51:39,320
into when you go into the dmt trance.
With all this

2006
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:44,120
really standard,
the standard messages that I myself have

2007
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:44,954
gotten from these psychedelic 
experiences that you have to treat each 

2008
01:51:46,821 --> 01:51:50,840
other as if we're all one and that our 
separations are all illusions.

2009
01:51:50,841 --> 01:51:51,674
That you are literally living a life 
that if I was born in your body and it 

2010
01:51:57,061 --> 01:51:57,894
had your genetics,
I would be you and you would be me 

2011
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:03,260
because we're all the same and our 
differences are really what the Illusion

2012
01:52:03,261 --> 01:52:04,094
is when we were these temporary beings 
and that negative thinking and negative 

2013
01:52:07,761 --> 01:52:08,594
feelings and all these things manifest 
themselves in negative actions and 

2014
01:52:11,151 --> 01:52:11,984
negative thoughts.
And you can change that and you can 

2015
01:52:13,281 --> 01:52:15,380
change the frequency in which you exist 
in this world.

2016
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:16,553
Like this is essentially what the 3000 
year old version of moses or more than 

2017
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:23,810
that moses has tablets were that they 
were,

2018
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:26,210
that god was the burning bush.

2019
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:28,060
Perfect.
Perfect.

2020
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:28,963
So can I ask you a question?
You've done some holistic 

2021
01:52:30,531 --> 01:52:31,364
hallucinogenics oh yeah.
And you've had some insight and that 

2022
01:52:33,551 --> 01:52:36,410
insight had something to do with 
treating people well.

2023
01:52:36,411 --> 01:52:37,570
So it definitelY did.
Okay.

2024
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:38,404
Was it true?

2025
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:41,320
Well,
it definitely has benefited me.

2026
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:44,320
True or false.
If you asked me,

2027
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:49,830
is it true that you have had a positive 
experiences from psychedelic drugs

2028
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:53,710
where you have interpreted those 
experiences and improve your life?

2029
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:54,540
Yes,
that's true.

2030
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:55,373
Okay.
So If you now go and you convey that 

2031
01:52:57,581 --> 01:53:01,420
thing to somebody who hasn't had the 
experience themselves,

2032
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:02,680
is it bullshit?
Well,

2033
01:53:02,681 --> 01:53:03,270
here's the thing,
right

2034
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:05,910
about psychedelics as opposed to all the
other ideologies,

2035
01:53:05,911 --> 01:53:08,910
is that they're very repeatable.
You don't have to believe in dmt.

2036
01:53:08,911 --> 01:53:09,744
If you smoke it,
you're going to experience it whether 

2037
01:53:10,621 --> 01:53:11,270
you believe in it or

2038
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:12,260
not.
Right.

2039
01:53:12,261 --> 01:53:13,590
And actually I think,
I mean,

2040
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:19,060
I am a cautious fan.
I say cautious because I don't think.

2041
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:20,803
I'm not a fan of the idea that these 
substances should be used 

2042
01:53:23,361 --> 01:53:25,070
recreationally.
I think that's a mistake.

2043
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,030
I agree with you.
Um,

2044
01:53:26,031 --> 01:53:26,864
I think it's fine to have a great time,
but that these things are so powerful 

2045
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:34,040
that one should be deliberate about it 
and you know,

2046
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:35,670
don't do it with a tv only

2047
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:37,443
about doing it recreationally is,
it's going to get more people to do it 

2048
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,810
and that if you think it's recreational 
and then you do it,

2049
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:45,120
there's going to be a certain percentage
of those people that go.

2050
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:47,880
What was that?
That's not what I thought it was.

2051
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:51,210
I thought it was going in there to have 
a good time and I just communicated with

2052
01:53:51,211 --> 01:53:52,044
god.

2053
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:53,970
Yep.
Air quotes.

2054
01:53:53,971 --> 01:53:54,810
God.
Yeah.

2055
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:55,500
Air quotes.
Well,

2056
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,333
but air quotes,
god is marvelous because air quotes god 

2057
01:53:59,641 --> 01:54:01,380
is the real deal,
right?

2058
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:03,840
In other words,
it's not a dude on a cloud.

2059
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,003
It's something,
it is a metaphor for something lodged 

2060
01:54:07,921 --> 01:54:11,040
very deep in the mind where you can't 
find it directly.

2061
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:11,874
And this is a hack that many cultures 
have used to access that layer and it's 

2062
01:54:15,661 --> 01:54:16,381
all very familiar.
Yeah.

2063
01:54:16,381 --> 01:54:16,590
To

2064
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:17,423
us.
And when you talk to people that have 

2065
01:54:18,961 --> 01:54:19,794
studied dmt in particular,
one of the reasons why I think it's so 

2066
01:54:22,051 --> 01:54:23,520
familiar to us,
when you,

2067
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:24,383
when you have this experience,
one of the first things that happens is 

2068
01:54:26,251 --> 01:54:27,084
you feel like you've been there before 
and they believed that this is because 

2069
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:32,790
during rem sleep your brain produces 
dmt.

2070
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,860
Yep.
It's very difficult to monitor,

2071
01:54:34,861 --> 01:54:38,310
but they have been able to through the 
cottonwood research foundation,

2072
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:39,803
which all started from the work of dr 
rick strassman out of the university of 

2073
01:54:42,721 --> 01:54:45,540
New Mexico who wrote a book called dmt,
the spirit molecule,

2074
01:54:46,170 --> 01:54:49,620
which was one of the very first times 
with a dea,

2075
01:54:49,621 --> 01:54:50,454
allowed them to do clinical studies on 
people with intravenous 

2076
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,090
dimethyltryptamine,
which is fucking serious shit.

2077
01:54:57,150 --> 01:55:00,150
So instead of like this 10 to 15 minute 
trip,

2078
01:55:00,151 --> 01:55:04,740
You're gone for a long time,
half hour plus and deep deep experiences

2079
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:07,260
that a lot of these people mirrored.

2080
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:12,060
They all had like super similar 
experiences.

2081
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:14,430
But through the cottonwood research 
foundation,

2082
01:55:14,431 --> 01:55:18,840
they found that live rats are producing 
dmt in their pineal gland.

2083
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:22,560
this has been proven now,
which was really just speculation.

2084
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:24,180
It was.
There was anecdotal evidence,

2085
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:25,193
but now they know that rats produced 
this so they don't know exactly when 

2086
01:55:28,051 --> 01:55:28,884
people do it because they would have to 
do the same thing they do to rats would 

2087
01:55:30,481 --> 01:55:31,314
have to open your brain up until they 
develop some sort of sophisticated 

2088
01:55:33,841 --> 01:55:34,674
detection methods.
It's just speculation as to when the 

2089
01:55:38,341 --> 01:55:41,220
brain's producing this incredibly potent
psychedelic drug,

2090
01:55:41,221 --> 01:55:43,860
but it's there right now.
It's producing it.

2091
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:44,070
We

2092
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,140
know it's produced in the liver.
It's produced in the lungs.

2093
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,320
It's endogenous to the human system and 
we don't know why.

2094
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,453
Yeah,
well,

2095
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:52,770
I'm pretty sure I have a good insight 
into why,

2096
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:53,993
but for the moment,
let's pursue the issue of what the 

2097
01:55:56,461 --> 01:55:59,040
implications are going to hold onto 
while cross my fingers.

2098
01:55:59,041 --> 01:56:00,700
Cross your fingers on that one.
Um,

2099
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:02,543
the story of just told is perfectly 
plausible whether it's 100 percent 

2100
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:08,370
accurate or not,
and we don't know,

2101
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:09,293
right?
But thE idea that your mind contains 

2102
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:17,730
mechanisms that go into some sort of 
psychedelic state without your conscious

2103
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:18,564
mind being able to tap into it.
So your conscious mind walks around 

2104
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:21,174
during the day,
not realizing that you're tripping at 

2105
01:56:22,201 --> 01:56:26,280
some other moments for some purpose.
It's all very interesting.

2106
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:30,750
You're not tripping in your sleeping 
mind for no reason at all.

2107
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:33,840
You're doing it for productive reasons,
logically speaking,

2108
01:56:33,841 --> 01:56:34,674
it has to be the case that if you're 
burning energy and going through the 

2109
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:43,920
costly exercise of thinking,
even in the psychedelic way,

2110
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,630
that it's happening for a reason.

2111
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:47,640
Right?
And that means that we have carried this

2112
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:48,474
with us from an ancestral state into the
modern state and we now have molecules 

2113
01:56:52,531 --> 01:56:55,140
that we can trigger it when we want to.
Um,

2114
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:56,993
that gives you access to a style of 
thinking that you're telling me has 

2115
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:06,390
altered your understanding of your 
relationship to other people and that it

2116
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:11,520
metaphorically lines up with what you 
often hear delivered in religious terms,

2117
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:13,950
right?
Abstractly,

2118
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:14,813
yes.
RigHt.

2119
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:18,450
And so when you say catholicism is a 
cult,

2120
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:19,913
I don't agree because catholicism 
historically must have been delivering 

2121
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:26,873
messages that caused people to correct 
their thinking in ways that made them 

2122
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,753
collaborate more effectively,
that made them better able to find the 

2123
01:57:35,971 --> 01:57:36,804
opportunities in their environment.
I'm not advocating that we should sign 

2124
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:46,400
up for belief systems that are at odds 
with our modern environment,

2125
01:57:47,730 --> 01:57:48,563
but one thing we can say I believe for 
sure is that religions that have stood 

2126
01:57:54,361 --> 01:57:55,194
the test of time did so because their 
value to the people who believed in 

2127
01:57:59,671 --> 01:57:59,880
them.

2128
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:04,880
It was so great that those,
that disbelieved were out competed now.

2129
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:10,580
So we get into trouble in the modern 
circumstance because we can look at many

2130
01:58:10,651 --> 01:58:11,484
of the teachings of any of these ancient
religions and we can compare them to 

2131
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:17,940
what we learned scientifically and 
detect that there's something not right.

2132
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:20,280
Can I stop you there?
I'm sure scientology.

2133
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:25,281
Is tHat a cult too early to tell?
Okay.

2134
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,760
But let's stop.
well,

2135
01:58:26,761 --> 01:58:27,330
that whole.
No,

2136
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:29,130
the guy who created it.
Well we do,

2137
01:58:29,131 --> 01:58:31,450
but we all have.
So let me drag you back it.

2138
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:32,293
So by the way,
I'm very uncomfortable with scientology 

2139
01:58:34,981 --> 01:58:37,020
and what it does,
but the problem is,

2140
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:40,680
um,
as scientology itself points out,

2141
01:58:40,681 --> 01:58:44,050
if you at the inception of something 
like the catholic church,

2142
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:46,150
you might be equally troubled.
Sure.

2143
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,610
Which is why I think they're both calls 
well,

2144
01:58:48,611 --> 01:58:50,080
but let's be careful about that.

2145
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:53,160
So what do you think are cult is?
What do you think you called it?

2146
01:58:53,470 --> 01:58:54,303
I cult is the predatory version.
It is tapping into people's natural 

2147
01:59:00,371 --> 01:59:04,060
tendency to believe in what I call a 
metaphorical truths.

2148
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:09,310
And it is using it very often to extract
resources from them to church.

2149
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:11,200
Well,
no,

2150
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:12,063
not like the catholic here at the 
catholic church is so long standing and 

2151
01:59:14,321 --> 01:59:15,154
the population that has.
I guess what I would say is if a 

2152
01:59:19,031 --> 01:59:19,864
population succeeds by believing in 
these things than cult is not the 

2153
01:59:24,521 --> 01:59:26,560
correct.
Thank you.

2154
01:59:26,561 --> 01:59:27,394
And I have different terms.
Were we using different definitions of 

2155
01:59:29,801 --> 01:59:31,060
the word called done?
But let me.

2156
01:59:31,061 --> 01:59:31,581
Let me.
Okay.

2157
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:34,090
Take.
There's a very interesting comparison.

2158
01:59:34,091 --> 01:59:34,924
So Joseph Smith,
who started the mormon church had a 

2159
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:39,550
turn,
right?

2160
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:41,840
He had a competitor,
uh,

2161
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:45,340
at the time as a book called the kingdom
of mathias,

2162
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,500
right about his competitor at the time.

2163
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:50,020
And to me the two looked equally 
plausible.

2164
01:59:50,021 --> 01:59:51,310
The story that they were selling.
Now,

2165
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:56,311
mathias never had more than 30 followers
and his religion died out and joseph and

2166
01:59:57,311 --> 02:00:01,660
Joseph Smith one and in the mormon 
church is obviously a real thing.

2167
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:02,673
Um,
but these sets of beliefs are advanced 

2168
02:00:06,611 --> 02:00:07,444
by somebody,
whether those somebodies are cynical 

2169
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:13,570
when they do it or whether they are 
earnest.

2170
02:00:13,571 --> 02:00:14,404
I think many of these,
the ones that we have that have lasted 

2171
02:00:18,191 --> 02:00:19,024
for long periods of time have been 
advanced by somebody who was in one way 

2172
02:00:22,331 --> 02:00:23,164
or another,
conscious or not dmt or not tapped into 

2173
02:00:27,161 --> 02:00:27,994
something that when delivered to other 
people actually constituted a kind of 

2174
02:00:31,361 --> 02:00:33,910
insight now as opposed to being a con 
man.

2175
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:35,170
Right?
Okay.

2176
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:36,083
And so,
so the origins of the catholic church 

2177
02:00:39,451 --> 02:00:43,500
most likely came from some desire for 
order and,

2178
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:44,363
uh,
a scaffolding of how to behave and to 

2179
02:00:46,830 --> 02:00:47,663
give people rules and structure for how 
to get through this life with the most 

2180
02:00:52,351 --> 02:00:53,184
amount of positivity and love.
And by disciplining them and having 

2181
02:00:56,641 --> 02:01:00,390
these grave punishments being held over 
their head,

2182
02:01:00,391 --> 02:01:02,940
burning in the fires of the pits of 
hell.

2183
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:07,740
If they decide to have sex with another 
man or were two different types of cloth

2184
02:01:07,741 --> 02:01:08,574
or whatever,
the other silly things that were in the 

2185
02:01:10,651 --> 02:01:14,190
old testament by doing this,
what they've essentially tried to do was

2186
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:15,540
offer people structure.

2187
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:18,190
No,
it's not really structure.

2188
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:19,083
It is a,
an analog for truths that can't be 

2189
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:24,183
spoken.
I'm literally because nobody knows how 

2190
02:01:26,651 --> 02:01:29,230
to phrase them.
So let's,

2191
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:32,050
let's deal with the church on the one 
hand and moses on the other.

2192
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:36,300
Moses is obviously important in,
uh,

2193
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:39,370
in jewish history.
If moses

2194
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,113
ate some dmt from the acacia bush,
I think it was smoke and he smells why 

2195
02:01:45,021 --> 02:01:45,854
the whole thing and the burning bush say
he smoked it and let's say he was super 

2196
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:49,634
savvy and farsighted and you know,
obviously he didn't know anything about 

2197
02:01:52,851 --> 02:01:57,851
molecules that suppose that he had some 
ancient model of something and he said,

2198
02:01:58,410 --> 02:01:59,243
there must have been something in that 
plant that caused crazy things to 

2199
02:02:02,121 --> 02:02:02,954
happen.
Let's suppose he didn't believe that he 

2200
02:02:03,891 --> 02:02:07,370
had contacted god or that god had 
contacted him.

2201
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:10,460
But you woke up from the thing and was 
like,

2202
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:11,503
wait a minute.
I know what these people are doing 

2203
02:02:12,651 --> 02:02:13,370
wrong.
I'm gonna.

2204
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:16,490
Write it down and tell them came from 
god,

2205
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:21,440
but his judaism now a cult.
I think they're all cults.

2206
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:24,710
I think all ideologies are cults.
I just don't.

2207
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:25,820
I don't know.
I don't.

2208
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:30,200
I don't think there is any one person 
who wrote,

2209
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:35,030
first of all,
when you're dealing with a christianity,

2210
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,830
you're dealing with translations,
right?

2211
02:02:36,830 --> 02:02:37,710
Or judaIsm,
you're.

2212
02:02:37,711 --> 02:02:38,544
You're dealing with like ancient 
translations of languages that aren't 

2213
02:02:41,421 --> 02:02:42,650
even spoken anymore.
Right,

2214
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:43,873
and you're also dealing with an oral 
tradition of who knows how many years 

2215
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:49,220
before it was ever bothered to be 
written down,

2216
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,483
but write,
but written down by people and then 

2217
02:02:53,181 --> 02:02:55,910
people decide what stays in and what 
doesn't.

2218
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:56,923
They changed the rules like the priest 
used to be able to marry priests in the 

2219
02:03:00,051 --> 02:03:02,120
catholic church.
Pope used to have wives.

2220
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,320
They ran armies.
I mean,

2221
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,193
this is clearly something that human 
beings have a hand in manipulating and 

2222
02:03:09,531 --> 02:03:10,364
changing,
and they do it for the benefit of the 

2223
02:03:11,691 --> 02:03:12,524
structure itself.
They're not doing it for the benefit of 

2224
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:14,804
the human beings that are part of it.
They're doing it for the benefit of the 

2225
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:18,290
structure itself.
Oh,

2226
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:20,720
that I don't agree,
but what's what case.

2227
02:03:20,830 --> 02:03:23,570
We'll do like the money and the amount 
of.

2228
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:25,700
I'm not,
I'm not saying you don't havE corruption

2229
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:27,830
in all of these structures.
You do.

2230
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:31,280
Um,
but I am saying that there is an immune.

2231
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:34,070
This is exactly parallel to what we were
talking about before.

2232
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,233
There is the predatory version which I 
would call a cult and there is the 

2233
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:42,620
earnest version which I would not call a
call now.

2234
02:03:42,621 --> 02:03:43,454
I'm very uncomfortable with any of these
things governing policy in the present 

2235
02:03:46,671 --> 02:03:47,504
because none of them have a literal 
relationship with reality that allows 

2236
02:03:51,381 --> 02:03:52,214
them to deal with the fact that we've 
got all these new problems for which 

2237
02:03:54,921 --> 02:03:56,690
there are no,
there's no religious wisdom.

2238
02:03:56,900 --> 02:04:00,050
Maybe there'S a problem in the word 
called maYbe,

2239
02:04:00,051 --> 02:04:00,884
uh,
maybe we should just say a structure 

2240
02:04:06,531 --> 02:04:10,970
created by human beings,
which is basically all structures,

2241
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:11,950
all structures,
all,

2242
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:16,960
all models of behavior where you have to
adhere to certain things.

2243
02:04:18,051 --> 02:04:18,884
But thE problem with religion and even 
with a lot of cults is these supposed 

2244
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:26,870
grave consequences for deviated.
Right?

2245
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:28,710
Well,
so alright,

2246
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:29,210
let's,
let's,

2247
02:04:29,210 --> 02:04:32,720
let's pick up catholicism because it's 
easy because so much of the structure is

2248
02:04:32,721 --> 02:04:33,554
visible to us.
I would argue that catholicism is going 

2249
02:04:37,811 --> 02:04:38,160
to be true

2250
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,440
of all of christianity.
It's gonna be true of judaism,

2251
02:04:41,441 --> 02:04:42,274
but catholicism is.
It is easy to see how it would 

2252
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:47,483
facilitate collaboration that 
effectively it would recreate in some 

2253
02:04:51,391 --> 02:04:52,224
sense the insight that you're talking 
about from dmt and that it would 

2254
02:04:55,411 --> 02:04:56,244
instantiate it in the population in a 
useful way that would facilitate 

2255
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:05,271
collaboration and disrupt processes that
cause infighting springing before.

2256
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:08,783
It might be a structure.
It's the scaffolding for human behavior 

2257
02:05:11,221 --> 02:05:12,250
and ethics.
Right?

2258
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:14,420
But imagine.
I mean we can see it in catholicism.

2259
02:05:14,470 --> 02:05:15,330
Sure.
Know where it is.

2260
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:16,313
So every week you have to go and confess
the shit you're doing wrong to the dude 

2261
02:05:21,061 --> 02:05:22,710
in the box.
Okay.

2262
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:25,440
That's how they used to spy on you.
I mean that's what that was for.

2263
02:05:25,441 --> 02:05:26,730
Well,
but why are they spying on you?

2264
02:05:26,731 --> 02:05:27,140
I mean,
no,

2265
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:29,550
they want to make sure that they don't 
get overthrown.

2266
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:30,791
Oh,
I don't.

2267
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:32,070
I think.
I think you're too cynical.

2268
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:32,701
Really?
Yeah.

2269
02:05:32,701 --> 02:05:34,230
Because what do you think they're doing?
Well,

2270
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,630
so first of all,
I'm a biologist.

2271
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:37,493
Okay.
How are these priests who don't marrY 

2272
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:42,210
passing on their genes?
They're not.

2273
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:43,080
Oh,
they are.

2274
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:44,420
Oh,
what are they doing?

2275
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:45,263
This snaky know,
facilitating the stability of the 

2276
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:53,370
lineage that they are in charge of.
So the point is they don't pass on their

2277
02:05:53,371 --> 02:05:54,204
genes directly.
They're passing on their genes 

2278
02:05:55,620 --> 02:06:00,620
indirectly through the population.
Their interests are synonymized with the

2279
02:06:00,871 --> 02:06:03,480
population that they are,
um,

2280
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:07,170
they are preaching to.
And so you tell the dude in the box,

2281
02:06:07,171 --> 02:06:09,480
which we've been doing wrong.
Imagine it's adultery.

2282
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,470
Oh god,
I'm,

2283
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:14,550
if I die before next week and I haven't 
confessed my adults,

2284
02:06:14,551 --> 02:06:15,870
you'd go to hell.
I'm going to go to hell.

2285
02:06:15,871 --> 02:06:16,704
That dad had a very unpleasant place.
I'm tell guy it doesn't get to have 

2286
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:20,160
someone to tell him.

2287
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:22,590
So now the person I've been committing 
adultery with his thinking,

2288
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:24,300
oh shit.
Well I was going to keep this a secret,

2289
02:06:24,301 --> 02:06:27,830
but now the priest is going to know that
I've been committing adultery.

2290
02:06:27,831 --> 02:06:29,580
They're going to hear from the other 
person.

2291
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:32,760
And so I better confess too.
So now the priest has a sense of like,

2292
02:06:32,761 --> 02:06:35,280
oh,
there's an adultery problem in the,

2293
02:06:35,281 --> 02:06:37,770
in the congregation,
and the priest is,

2294
02:06:37,771 --> 02:06:39,540
you know,
flipping through the book and thinking,

2295
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:40,291
oh,
this week,

2296
02:06:40,291 --> 02:06:41,580
what should we talk about?
And so,

2297
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:42,703
you know,
the priest then gets up at the pulpit 

2298
02:06:44,370 --> 02:06:45,181
and uh,
you know,

2299
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:48,620
turn your book to on whatever,
um,

2300
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,613
and starts going on about adultery and 
the people in the congregation who are 

2301
02:06:54,631 --> 02:06:56,580
engaged in adultery or thinking,
oh shit,

2302
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:57,653
this is god talking to me directly.
God knows what I've been up to and he's 

2303
02:07:01,111 --> 02:07:03,330
not happy and that's why we'Re reading 
this psalm.

2304
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:04,800
I better cut it,
the fuck out,

2305
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:07,500
right?
So my poInt is,

2306
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:11,910
the dude in the box,
he's taken a vow of poverty.

2307
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:15,570
He's living in the church.
He does well when the town does well.

2308
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:16,680
um,
he,

2309
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:21,770
he's not having babies of his own,
so he can't really get ahead by himself.

2310
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:23,273
He gets ahead genetically speaking when 
the town does well and he's in a 

2311
02:07:27,091 --> 02:07:27,924
position to spot what's going wrong in 
the town and he doesn't have a dog in 

2312
02:07:30,691 --> 02:07:32,640
that fight because he's not involved in 
business.

2313
02:07:32,790 --> 02:07:36,240
He's not involved in a meeting and,
and being a little salt

2314
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:37,143
relatively recent when it comes to the 
catholic church in the last couple of 

2315
02:07:39,491 --> 02:07:40,324
hundred dollars.
And I would argue if you look back at 

2316
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:42,543
any of these traditions,
any of the ones that worked will 

2317
02:07:44,231 --> 02:07:45,064
successfully have addressed the question
of how you prevent corruption from 

2318
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:51,430
emerging apparently was sexual 
corruption.

2319
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:52,533
These guys were rock stars.
Like the priests were essentially the 

2320
02:07:54,821 --> 02:07:55,654
guys who had the direct line to god and 
just like professors have been known to 

2321
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:00,184
do.
Not you,

2322
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:01,293
but you know,
some have sex with their students 

2323
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:05,860
because the students like look at them 
like,

2324
02:08:05,890 --> 02:08:06,723
oh my god,
I can't believe that professor sitting 

2325
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:09,154
down here with my work.
And that's a very minor connection in 

2326
02:08:13,241 --> 02:08:14,074
comparison to the connection to god.
Anybody who's going to have anybody 

2327
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:19,550
who's going to have power is in danger 
of abusing it.

2328
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:22,960
Sure.
I would say it's interesting that in the

2329
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:25,500
catholic church and in other traditions 
where,

2330
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:26,413
uh,
a marriage and making money are 

2331
02:08:29,740 --> 02:08:34,510
impossible,
that these appear to be a evolved.

2332
02:08:35,110 --> 02:08:36,730
Um,
what's the word?

2333
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,350
Uh,
it's like,

2334
02:08:39,230 --> 02:08:42,390
um,
error correction or,

2335
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:44,380
or protection from,
from a virus.

2336
02:08:44,381 --> 02:08:45,214
So an outbreak of corruption in the 
church is a bad thing from the point of 

2337
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:52,090
view of the wellbeing of the 
congregation and a something that says,

2338
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:52,924
well,
if you're a priest in your spending 

2339
02:08:53,861 --> 02:08:54,960
money in town,
people are gonna,

2340
02:08:54,980 --> 02:08:56,920
look at you funny because you're not 
supposed to have money.

2341
02:08:57,250 --> 02:08:58,310
And if you're,
you know,

2342
02:08:58,510 --> 02:09:01,080
hanging around with cute girls,
people are gonna.

2343
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,890
Look at you funny because you're not 
supposed to be havIng sex.

2344
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:08,080
Um,
so this limits their ability to get away

2345
02:09:08,501 --> 02:09:09,970
with stuff.
I'm not sAying it's zero,

2346
02:09:09,971 --> 02:09:10,804
obviously it's not,
but the idea that there will be 

2347
02:09:11,981 --> 02:09:14,190
protections in,
um,

2348
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:15,093
in each tradition for this,
that religions that don't successfully 

2349
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:23,791
protect against abuses of power will 
succumb in competition to religions that

2350
02:09:25,061 --> 02:09:25,894
do it effectively.
And so you're absolutely correct that 

2351
02:09:29,021 --> 02:09:33,730
all of the changes in religious texts 
that people believe in those,

2352
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:34,564
that's all human beings making decisions
about what to keep and what to throw 

2353
02:09:37,541 --> 02:09:37,990
out.

2354
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:41,200
And I'm not arguing anything else,
but what I am arguing as those that have

2355
02:09:41,201 --> 02:09:42,034
been insightful about what to keep from 
the point of view of the particular 

2356
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:48,580
problems faced by the population that 
they are in,

2357
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:49,593
we'll have a competitive advantage 
because they will function more 

2358
02:09:52,991 --> 02:09:57,991
cohesively than a population of atheists
who doesn't have somebody looking out to

2359
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:03,900
prevent outbreaks of competition inside 
the lineage or outbreaks of infighting.

2360
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:08,170
So if you were looking at it in an 
objective way,

2361
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,033
like say if you were an alien from 
another planet that didn't understand 

2362
02:10:11,351 --> 02:10:14,320
the language and you just observing the 
structure,

2363
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:17,110
you would see as error correction,
the structure would say,

2364
02:10:17,111 --> 02:10:17,944
oh,
they realized there was an issue here 

2365
02:10:18,761 --> 02:10:19,594
with power.
And so they error corrected by making 

2366
02:10:21,581 --> 02:10:22,414
these priests be celibate and then they 
figured out a way to keep them from 

2367
02:10:25,541 --> 02:10:28,330
having money and that'll keep them from 
being invested in.

2368
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:29,800
Okay.
Yeah.

2369
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:30,753
I see what you're saying.
And I think it's very misleading to 

2370
02:10:32,261 --> 02:10:33,094
people who analyze things the way you 
and I would because there's so much 

2371
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:40,730
hocus pocus associated with these 
structures that,

2372
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:43,280
you know,
it's like constantly putting a finger in

2373
02:10:43,281 --> 02:10:45,680
the,
in the eye of an analytical person.

2374
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:46,311
Of course.
I mean,

2375
02:10:46,311 --> 02:10:47,660
just the way they dress,
right?

2376
02:10:47,661 --> 02:10:48,494
I mean just the wearing the wizard 
costume and holding the staff and 

2377
02:10:51,141 --> 02:10:54,020
sitting on the golden throne.
And then all of it.

2378
02:10:54,021 --> 02:10:55,520
I mean,
all the pageantry to it.

2379
02:10:55,521 --> 02:10:57,290
It's all preposterous.
I mean,

2380
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,720
I agree.
Looking at it as a modern person,

2381
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:02,030
it looks preposterous to me.
On the other hand,

2382
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:04,430
there is no way I'm telling you.
I mean,

2383
02:11:04,431 --> 02:11:06,740
most of my colleagues,
I'm sure would disagree with this,

2384
02:11:06,741 --> 02:11:08,400
but I hope to,
um,

2385
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:11,360
to show them to be wrong on this front,
the,

2386
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:12,223
there is no way that the huge amount of 
effort and resource that is invested in 

2387
02:11:17,751 --> 02:11:20,450
these structures was an error.

2388
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:24,110
Cannot have been an evolutionary error.
Because if it was,

2389
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,273
the huge investment that is put into 
these structures is an opportunity for 

2390
02:11:29,541 --> 02:11:32,270
some population that behaves in exactly 
the same way.

2391
02:11:32,271 --> 02:11:34,460
Except it doesn't make that error to 
win,

2392
02:11:34,730 --> 02:11:37,250
right,
but when you get power and then you have

2393
02:11:37,251 --> 02:11:38,084
the momentum of that power,
I'm overcoming the population and then 

2394
02:11:42,471 --> 02:11:43,304
you have positions where the behavior 
patterns are extremely restrictive and 

2395
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:53,300
you have to behave inside these behavior
patterns or there's grave consequences.

2396
02:11:53,650 --> 02:11:54,483
I mean,
you could conceivably run that for a 

2397
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:58,880
thousand years without any error 
correction,

2398
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:01,010
and that's what you've got with islam,
right?

2399
02:12:01,011 --> 02:12:01,844
You've got a very ancient form of 
religion that michael shermer wrote a 

2400
02:12:06,441 --> 02:12:07,274
piece about it that's pretty interesting
where he was talking about how it's the 

2401
02:12:09,951 --> 02:12:10,784
only religion that didn't go through the
enlightenment and he makes these 

2402
02:12:13,521 --> 02:12:14,354
comparisons to like the corrections that
have been had with other religions as 

2403
02:12:18,981 --> 02:12:21,440
time has gone on that haven't happened 
there,

2404
02:12:21,441 --> 02:12:23,750
and you could equate it to resource 
management.

2405
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:26,660
You could equate it to the part of the 
world in which they live.

2406
02:12:26,661 --> 02:12:28,790
You could equate it.
There's a lot of different ways that you

2407
02:12:28,791 --> 02:12:30,650
could try to figure out why this 
happened,

2408
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:34,610
but the reality is that that thing has 
not changed.

2409
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:37,340
That structure has not changed for a 
long time.

2410
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:41,780
I think you've hit on exactly the right 
point.

2411
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:47,170
M islams mechanism for preventing 
outbreaks of chain parasitism was to,

2412
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:56,290
to hard code the thing,
and this is a tragedy because it,

2413
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:57,283
what it means is that where islam needs 
to update it doesn't have the mechanism 

2414
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,300
for doing it,
so,

2415
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:03,583
uh,
but also has a built in way to keep 

2416
02:13:06,651 --> 02:13:07,484
people aboard.
Like if you become an apostate that 

2417
02:13:09,411 --> 02:13:10,910
you're allowed,
you can kill them.

2418
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:12,800
Right?
And kill apostates which is,

2419
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:15,530
there is no other religion that we have 
right now that operates like,

2420
02:13:15,531 --> 02:13:18,980
that has draconian imagines of 
scientology.

2421
02:13:18,981 --> 02:13:20,960
Did that,
right?

2422
02:13:20,961 --> 02:13:21,794
Well,
I mean scientology obviously has a huge 

2423
02:13:23,391 --> 02:13:26,390
number of completely unacceptable 
mechanisms to keep people from leaving,

2424
02:13:26,490 --> 02:13:27,323
but,
but how is that not a cult since it was 

2425
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:31,920
created by a science fiction writer 
literally

2426
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:33,600
out of nowhere.

2427
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:38,550
I'm going to be horrified if I said it 
wasn't too early to tell.

2428
02:13:38,770 --> 02:13:40,470
So how is that possible?
Okay.

2429
02:13:40,650 --> 02:13:41,420
So that could be

2430
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:42,253
benefits in the future.
If scientology continues to evolve and 

2431
02:13:45,111 --> 02:13:45,944
self self-correct,
it could get to the point where it's a 

2432
02:13:47,871 --> 02:13:48,704
behavior pattern that could be 
complimentary and perhaps even 

2433
02:13:52,311 --> 02:13:53,480
beneficial to people.

2434
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:55,760
I do not believe that this is where it 
is headed.

2435
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:56,743
But if a thousand years from now it had 
flourished and the population that 

2436
02:14:03,111 --> 02:14:08,030
believed these things was successfully 
growing,

2437
02:14:08,031 --> 02:14:08,870
you'd have to say,
well,

2438
02:14:08,871 --> 02:14:10,160
there's something in that set of 
beliefs.

2439
02:14:10,161 --> 02:14:11,780
It's working for these.
Um,

2440
02:14:12,230 --> 02:14:13,063
so anyway,
I'm not arguing that it isn't the 

2441
02:14:14,771 --> 02:14:15,604
called.
It has lots of hallmarks that make me 

2442
02:14:17,181 --> 02:14:18,014
think

2443
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:20,830
I'm troubled by including much like 
mormonism.

2444
02:14:20,860 --> 02:14:22,000
You know,
the guy who made it,

2445
02:14:22,510 --> 02:14:24,340
but this,
unlike mormonism,

2446
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:27,430
which was an 1820,
we have video,

2447
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:29,110
we see l,
ron hubbard,

2448
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:32,060
bad teeth,
and his fucking captain's outfit on with

2449
02:14:32,061 --> 02:14:33,570
a metals that he gave himself.
You're like,

2450
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:35,620
hey,
what is this?

2451
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:36,431
Right.
Oh,

2452
02:14:36,431 --> 02:14:36,881
right.
Oh,

2453
02:14:36,881 --> 02:14:38,430
you get a planet when you die,
or

2454
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,350
something like that.
It sounds like a cult to me.

2455
02:14:40,351 --> 02:14:41,280
On the other hand,
you know,

2456
02:14:41,281 --> 02:14:42,114
I mean,
we've got the mormons get a planet when 

2457
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:47,940
you're.
Sorry scientologists don't get a planet.

2458
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:48,491
No,
no.

2459
02:14:48,491 --> 02:14:49,324
The mormons do.
And it was one of the osman brothers 

2460
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:55,690
albums,
they all went to these planets.

2461
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:58,060
Like in the album,
I forget what the album is.

2462
02:14:58,300 --> 02:15:00,490
It's a hilarious album.
But if you open it up,

2463
02:15:00,491 --> 02:15:03,580
it's all planets.
And the album,

2464
02:15:03,581 --> 02:15:08,470
the name of the album is this concept 
that you get a planet when you die

2465
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:13,530
to me,
because the universe is so big,

2466
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:14,710
we can each afforded.

2467
02:15:15,070 --> 02:15:17,020
That's the plan.
That's it.

2468
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:20,620
See that?
That is some joseph smith's shit,

2469
02:15:21,190 --> 02:15:23,530
by the way.
It's a wonderful book.

2470
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:24,670
If you,
if you read the,

2471
02:15:24,671 --> 02:15:27,610
the actual origins of mormonism people 
that are listening to go,

2472
02:15:27,611 --> 02:15:28,660
wait a minute,
what do they believe?

2473
02:15:29,170 --> 02:15:30,850
Wow.
They believe some wacky stuff.

2474
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:32,200
But uh,
he,

2475
02:15:32,201 --> 02:15:33,034
uh,
he had a golden or a seer stone rather 

2476
02:15:35,950 --> 02:15:38,320
that allowed him to read the golden 
tablets.

2477
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:39,303
The seer stone was a special magic rock 
that allowed him to read these golden 

2478
02:15:43,091 --> 02:15:45,070
tablets that contained the last work of 
jesus.

2479
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:47,140
Is that the inside of the album with 
other planets?

2480
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:50,350
So I,
I believe he was actually illiterate.

2481
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,840
And that was a con man.
He was murdered,

2482
02:15:52,841 --> 02:15:53,674
put a sheet over his head and dictated 
what he was supposedly reading to 

2483
02:15:57,131 --> 02:15:59,290
somebody else.
That's my understanding of it.

2484
02:15:59,291 --> 02:16:00,124
But,
um,

2485
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:04,120
it was a charismatic person,
but many people have created cults.

2486
02:16:04,121 --> 02:16:04,954
He was,

2487
02:16:07,320 --> 02:16:08,153
I think what they did right?
Mormons are some of the nicest people 

2488
02:16:10,571 --> 02:16:13,630
I've ever met.
They have an amazing sense of community.

2489
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:16,210
They're super nice and I've always said 
that if I was going to join a cult,

2490
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:17,223
I think I joined the mormons,
but where they fucked up is they 

2491
02:16:19,750 --> 02:16:23,680
regulations came in,
they started restricting the market.

2492
02:16:24,010 --> 02:16:24,843
They started,
the regulators came in and stop these 

2493
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:30,220
people from having nine wives and then 
they're not going to be so nice anymore.

2494
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:31,413
The reason why they were so nice is 
because they have these crazy 

2495
02:16:33,431 --> 02:16:34,264
relationships.
There were having orgies every night at 

2496
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:38,650
nine people living in the house.
Then they allowed to have sex with.

2497
02:16:38,651 --> 02:16:43,030
It was a problem with your day because 
for everybody who had nine wives,

2498
02:16:43,031 --> 02:16:43,864
they were eight dudes who had not.
Those guys got to get their shit 

2499
02:16:46,121 --> 02:16:49,390
together and start their own call on gas
where you know,

2500
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,440
well,
maybe they are gay.

2501
02:16:50,830 --> 02:16:52,120
I don't know.
Um,

2502
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,570
what about the women too,
right?

2503
02:16:53,750 --> 02:16:56,200
How about a woman who has 10 husbands?
You know,

2504
02:16:56,340 --> 02:16:58,210
this is bullshit for her.
That doesn't happen.

2505
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:01,180
yeah,
it should right now be possible.

2506
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:01,601
No.
No.

2507
02:17:01,601 --> 02:17:03,250
See there's a really good biological 
reason.

2508
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,720
It doesn't make any sense,
but you already.

2509
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:08,670
Oh man,
don't,

2510
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:10,750
don't,
don't go polyandrous on me.

2511
02:17:10,751 --> 02:17:11,584
He went,
we went way far away from our original 

2512
02:17:13,751 --> 02:17:14,770
point,
which was,

2513
02:17:14,771 --> 02:17:15,604
um,
that you could figure out a way to 

2514
02:17:17,171 --> 02:17:19,490
restructure with this.
Uh,

2515
02:17:20,470 --> 02:17:22,330
I don't want to call it plan b because 
that's the abortion

2516
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:23,433
game.
Be.

2517
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,160
Yeah.
Maybe.

2518
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:25,530
Well,
I don't want to say it.

2519
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:27,940
There is no game b at the moment.
What?

2520
02:17:27,941 --> 02:17:28,774
There is a conversation that emerged 
from this and the basic point is that 

2521
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:32,763
one constructure a superior deal to what
people are able to work out for 

2522
02:17:37,481 --> 02:17:42,481
themselves and it can function inside of
the system and it can gain adherence for

2523
02:17:43,751 --> 02:17:44,584
the very same reason that people are 
buying bitcoin for the same reason that 

2524
02:17:47,951 --> 02:17:48,784
people have decided to get smartphones 
for the same reason people have signed 

2525
02:17:52,481 --> 02:17:54,490
up for facebook.
Those are,

2526
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:56,493
with the exception of bitcoin.
Those are game examples and they are 

2527
02:18:00,910 --> 02:18:05,110
predatory.
But you could provide a version that was

2528
02:18:05,111 --> 02:18:05,944
not predatory,
that would function in a superior way 

2529
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:10,750
with respect to how,
uh,

2530
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:15,460
how it enhanced your ability to function
in the world and rational people.

2531
02:18:15,461 --> 02:18:16,060
I mean,
you know,

2532
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:16,893
you make a good point.

2533
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:18,273
It's not that we have billions of people
who are sophisticated enough to know 

2534
02:18:22,451 --> 02:18:25,300
that they should be looking for that 
alternative and who will jump on it.

2535
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:30,480
But to the extent that you have people 
that are sophisticated,

2536
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:34,510
are aware that their lives are being 
disrupted by forces.

2537
02:18:34,511 --> 02:18:39,511
That they're incapable of managing like 
these dopamine traps and the like,

2538
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:42,640
uh,
who will embrace these technologies?

2539
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:43,474
Because they themselves are looking for 
a mechanism to insulate from the 

2540
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:49,360
predatory things that have emerged in 
the market.

2541
02:18:49,570 --> 02:18:50,403
What You will get is the spread of these
technologies and if there's one sort of 

2542
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:55,893
key message here about all of the 
objections that one might raise about 

2543
02:18:58,901 --> 02:18:59,734
the difficulty of creating such 
alternatives and getting them to be 

2544
02:19:03,461 --> 02:19:04,294
adopted,
the number of things that we have 

2545
02:19:06,311 --> 02:19:07,144
already adopted because we got something
for her cell phone being the perfect 

2546
02:19:10,961 --> 02:19:11,794
example.
We didn't have to tell people to get a 

2547
02:19:13,481 --> 02:19:14,230
cell phone.

2548
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:15,063
People got a cell phone because of all 
the things that they could see that it 

2549
02:19:17,111 --> 02:19:17,944
did for them.
And that same drive to pick up some new 

2550
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:26,380
technology or agreement because it 
enhances your life.

2551
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:29,480
It solves some problem for you in some 
way that's good.

2552
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:33,800
That causes the thing to be adopted out 
of self interest and that,

2553
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:38,540
that is what the mechanism for change is
going to have to look like.

2554
02:19:38,630 --> 02:19:43,630
His self interest causing people to 
embrace a shift in the,

2555
02:19:44,190 --> 02:19:45,023
uh,
the opportunities and obligations that 

2556
02:19:46,971 --> 02:19:49,160
they're signed up for.
Now,

2557
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:52,430
I think one of the problems that I have 
with this is that,

2558
02:19:52,990 --> 02:19:53,823
uh,
I always assumed that this is going to 

2559
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:58,910
be like on january the first we're 
switching over to the new system,

2560
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:00,800
but it's not right.
Can't be camp,

2561
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:01,634
can't be a ba.
It's got to be almost like a natural 

2562
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:09,850
chain of events or it has to be like 
water flowing down hill.

2563
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:11,473
that.
So I can speak scientifically about my 

2564
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:17,020
own field because,
you know,

2565
02:20:17,070 --> 02:20:18,760
I,
I did enough training that I,

2566
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:20,630
I,
I know where the bodies are buried.

2567
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:25,520
When you're in a field and that field is
stuck,

2568
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:27,253
it is impossible to move the field.
You can't get a hearing that will allow 

2569
02:20:31,491 --> 02:20:36,320
you to change the way the field thinks.
But you can step outside the field.

2570
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:41,030
You can leave the reservation as it 
were,

2571
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:44,280
and you can proceed by other means.
And what,

2572
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:46,670
what happens is the same thing that you 
know,

2573
02:20:46,671 --> 02:20:47,504
lars anderson discovered with archery,
is that once you're no longer signed up 

2574
02:20:51,531 --> 02:20:52,364
for what good form looks like,
there are all kinds of ways to 

2575
02:20:55,431 --> 02:20:59,570
accomplish things that are not 
documented.

2576
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:05,020
And so finding those alternatives,
gay may is not serving people's needs.

2577
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:09,230
We are all unhealthy,
you know,

2578
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:11,780
even if we find a way to be physically 
healthy,

2579
02:21:11,781 --> 02:21:12,614
we are all overwhelmed by so much social
noise and so much a choice that is 

2580
02:21:19,251 --> 02:21:20,084
meaningless that we end up wasting a 
huge fraction of our time spending a 

2581
02:21:24,021 --> 02:21:24,854
tremendous amount of our mental effort 
on puzzles that aren't interesting or 

2582
02:21:27,981 --> 02:21:29,360
worthwhile or productive.

2583
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:30,583
and so we are all,
each of us has a giant opportunity to 

2584
02:21:34,671 --> 02:21:35,504
upgrade our lives by simply removing a 
bunch of the noise by getting the 

2585
02:21:40,251 --> 02:21:44,480
systems that are supposed to function in
our interest to do so more effectively.

2586
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:48,470
And therefore we are a,
I hate to use the word consumers,

2587
02:21:48,471 --> 02:21:49,304
but we would be willing consumers for a 
better alternative or to show up for us 

2588
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:57,680
and presenting that alternative so that 
people find it,

2589
02:21:57,890 --> 02:22:00,710
they experiment with it.
And upon discovering that actually,

2590
02:22:00,711 --> 02:22:01,544
you know what,
I am better off when I participate in 

2591
02:22:03,711 --> 02:22:06,350
this way than that way that that causes 
adoption.

2592
02:22:06,470 --> 02:22:07,880
And it doesn't take very many.
You know,

2593
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:11,540
bitcoin obviously started with,
you know,

2594
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:14,990
an ambitious person who set the thing in
motion,

2595
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:17,690
what's the currency with only one person
using it,

2596
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,153
right?
But now it's not a currency with one 

2597
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:21,530
person using it.

2598
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:23,150
It's a currency.
You've used it.

2599
02:22:23,151 --> 02:22:24,340
I've used it.
Um,

2600
02:22:24,460 --> 02:22:25,293
so anyway,
it is possible to get adoption based on 

2601
02:22:27,091 --> 02:22:30,930
the fact that the thing solves problems 
that people are otherwise stuck with.

2602
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:33,810
Do you think that because things are 
moving so quickly today,

2603
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:37,290
it seems to me that like new ideas are 
implemented so fast.

2604
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:38,153
New concepts are accepted so quickly 
that something like this where it 

2605
02:22:41,611 --> 02:22:45,480
might've taken several decades,
a few decades ago,

2606
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:49,320
would only take a few years today.
Well,

2607
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:51,240
the,
there it become a thing.

2608
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:53,160
There are two things.
One,

2609
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:54,203
there is the possibility that things 
will change very rapidly and then there 

2610
02:22:56,731 --> 02:23:00,750
is the fact that they must,
because the trajectory we're on,

2611
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:02,323
we are playing with such powerful 
technologies and being operated at such 

2612
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:11,000
a high rate with such high throughput 
that um,

2613
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:13,320
those of us who have started,
you know,

2614
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:14,243
I think it's a mistake to look at the 
problems of the world as individual 

2615
02:23:17,371 --> 02:23:17,790
problems.

2616
02:23:17,790 --> 02:23:18,623
It's much more effective to look at them
as symptoms of problems that don't have 

2617
02:23:22,951 --> 02:23:23,784
names.
So we have an economic system that 

2618
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:28,463
generates technologies that create great
benefits in the short term at some 

2619
02:23:32,851 --> 02:23:36,420
massive cost in the long term.
And we have no mechanism.

2620
02:23:36,421 --> 02:23:39,810
Once they've generated massive profits,
there's no ability to shut them off,

2621
02:23:40,150 --> 02:23:42,120
right?
That's a problem that has many,

2622
02:23:42,121 --> 02:23:44,360
many symptoms that we could name,
but um,

2623
02:23:44,990 --> 02:23:49,410
that we,
we in effect don't have much time.

2624
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:50,453
That the rate at which we are 
liquidating the wellbeing of the planet 

2625
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:58,590
at present is so fast that effectively 
we need,

2626
02:23:58,980 --> 02:24:00,870
we need to change quickly.
And It doesn't mean.

2627
02:24:01,710 --> 02:24:02,543
I guess that's the other thing that I 
haven't said yet is nobody including me 

2628
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:06,983
thinks that we're going to be able to 
spell out an answer in the present that 

2629
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:11,273
is correct,
but what we can do is navigate in the 

2630
02:24:15,391 --> 02:24:16,224
direction of the answer that is correct 
and we can discover what that answer 

2631
02:24:19,471 --> 02:24:20,130
looks like.

2632
02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:20,963
In other words,
the right model is not the writing down 

2633
02:24:24,991 --> 02:24:25,824
of the new rules of the world and the 
embrace of them because you get 

2634
02:24:29,581 --> 02:24:33,540
benefits.
It is prototyping what the new structure

2635
02:24:33,541 --> 02:24:34,374
would be and then you institute the 
prototype and some group of people who 

2636
02:24:38,191 --> 02:24:39,024
have signed up for it and then you 
discover what you didn't know about it 

2637
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:42,353
that you needed to know and you correct 
those problems so that what you get is 

2638
02:24:45,481 --> 02:24:50,481
effectively evolution.
Building an elegant solution rather than

2639
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:54,840
what progressives often accidentally 
invite,

2640
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:55,913
which is good intentions that produce 
horrifying outcomes because you didn't 

2641
02:25:00,301 --> 02:25:02,880
know what they were actually going to do
once you set them in motion.

2642
02:25:03,170 --> 02:25:05,280
Right?
Communism being a great example,

2643
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:07,890
you think communism is going to solve 
the problems of the world.

2644
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:09,180
In fact,
it creates,

2645
02:25:10,130 --> 02:25:10,963
you know,
massive harm and kills millions because 

2646
02:25:16,441 --> 02:25:18,690
you didn't understand what it would do 
in motion.

2647
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:21,060
So we don't want to ever face that 
again.

2648
02:25:21,061 --> 02:25:25,990
We don't want to be utopians.
Anytime you engage in utopianism,

2649
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:28,570
if you set it in motion and you're going
to create a dystopia,

2650
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:29,433
it's virtually guaranteed.
The way to avoid that is not to imagine 

2651
02:25:32,861 --> 02:25:33,191
that,
you know,

2652
02:25:33,191 --> 02:25:34,024
the answer gets to define what objective
you want the system to reach and then 

2653
02:25:39,610 --> 02:25:41,110
navigate towards it.

2654
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:45,313
Um,
how do you think this could be 

2655
02:25:46,001 --> 02:25:47,770
implemented?
Well,

2656
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:51,820
uh,
it requires capital frankly,

2657
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:57,180
and it requires capital and people who 
understand what the problems are.

2658
02:25:58,060 --> 02:25:58,893
Most importantly,
it requires people who understand game 

2659
02:26:03,041 --> 02:26:03,874
theory because what we keep doing is 
setting systems in motion that have the 

2660
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:12,880
characteristics that guarantee 
evolution.

2661
02:26:13,870 --> 02:26:14,703
There are only four of them.
And if you set a system in motion that 

2662
02:26:16,901 --> 02:26:20,560
has those four characteristics,
you will get adaptive evolution and what

2663
02:26:20,561 --> 02:26:22,800
it will produce.
You have no control over it.

2664
02:26:22,801 --> 02:26:25,610
It will produce whatever the niche space
allows.

2665
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:26,843
Um,
so you need people who are aware of the 

2666
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:34,900
game theoretic parameters of the space.
And who understand,

2667
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:40,600
essentially the game theory is a very 
important topic.

2668
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:41,853
It's less complicated than people think.
There aren't as many games as you would 

2669
02:26:44,231 --> 02:26:45,064
imagine.
There are a few canonical ones and then 

2670
02:26:46,571 --> 02:26:47,404
there a bunch of variations on a theme,
but understanding those things so that 

2671
02:26:51,281 --> 02:26:52,114
you can use so you can effectively 
harness the power of evolution to build 

2672
02:26:57,101 --> 02:26:57,934
a functional system rather than build a 
system and then suffer the consequences 

2673
02:27:02,891 --> 02:27:04,750
of evolution that you didn't anticipate.

2674
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:05,613
That's what we keep doing.
We built an economY and a political 

2675
02:27:07,901 --> 02:27:08,734
system that evolve out from under us and
they create monstrous phenomena that we 

2676
02:27:14,171 --> 02:27:16,060
didn't anticipate because they weren't 
in the plan.

2677
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:20,830
Do you think that it's possible that you
see the radical change?

2678
02:27:20,890 --> 02:27:21,723
The social change has happened just over
the last couple months since the harvey 

2679
02:27:24,581 --> 02:27:28,630
weinstein.
You see what's happened?

2680
02:27:28,631 --> 02:27:33,580
I mean it literally is probably stop 
sexual harassment dead in his tracks.

2681
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:34,773
Women who work in these workplaces that 
had to deal with the consequences of 

2682
02:27:37,781 --> 02:27:38,614
these guys,
the amount of those sexual harassment 

2683
02:27:41,291 --> 02:27:44,620
episodes is probably been radically 
reduced like that.

2684
02:27:44,650 --> 02:27:45,880
Yeah.
Is it temporary though?

2685
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:47,320
I don't know.
It's a good question.

2686
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:48,333
It's a good question.
I think because my only concern is that 

2687
02:27:54,520 --> 02:27:55,353
with false accusations or overreactions 
or people that are just not treating 

2688
02:28:01,871 --> 02:28:02,704
this like the incredibly powerful medium
that it is the medium for change and 

2689
02:28:08,171 --> 02:28:09,004
then using it to their own benefit,
people could get greedy and corrupt 

2690
02:28:11,621 --> 02:28:12,730
this.
Right.

2691
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:15,190
But I think it's already happening.
Sure.

2692
02:28:15,430 --> 02:28:16,690
I'm sure what,
you know,

2693
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:17,940
examples.
Yeah.

2694
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:19,090
A couple of them.
I mean,

2695
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:22,430
I don't want to.
I'm like every other man,

2696
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:23,264
I am hesitant to put my weight on the 
ice with anybody because who knows what 

2697
02:28:26,331 --> 02:28:27,200
you don't know.
Right.

2698
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:32,410
But I've seen several stories now that I
find very disturbing.

2699
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:34,490
The first one,
and I must say,

2700
02:28:34,491 --> 02:28:37,280
you know,
this was a topic of conversation with me

2701
02:28:37,281 --> 02:28:38,114
and my friends is I'm guessing it would 
have been with you and your friends and 

2702
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:42,573
uh,

2703
02:28:43,730 --> 02:28:45,420
I feel weird saying this on your 
podcast,

2704
02:28:45,421 --> 02:28:46,440
but herod comes,

2705
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:54,270
my friends and I have discussed this,
had a kind of reaction which was,

2706
02:28:55,050 --> 02:28:55,883
you know,
it turns out to have been a really good 

2707
02:28:58,681 --> 02:29:01,740
decision never to grope anybody who 
wasn't into it.

2708
02:29:02,070 --> 02:29:03,240
Right,
right,

2709
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:05,280
right.
Of course,

2710
02:29:05,281 --> 02:29:07,380
it wasn't the reason that we didn't grow
up anybody,

2711
02:29:07,381 --> 02:29:08,214
but um,
but nonetheless it turns out to have 

2712
02:29:11,461 --> 02:29:12,294
been a benefit that we don't,
we're not worried about what's gonna 

2713
02:29:14,330 --> 02:29:15,560
emerge.
Yes.

2714
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:17,183
So that's what I was saying.
And then I saw this garrison keillor 

2715
02:29:18,901 --> 02:29:19,760
story.
Yeah.

2716
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:23,130
And suddenly I didn't feel so safe 
anymore because it's in keilor.

2717
02:29:23,131 --> 02:29:26,040
One is the most disturbing one.
It's not actually,

2718
02:29:26,041 --> 02:29:27,780
but it's not.
No,

2719
02:29:28,110 --> 02:29:30,150
there's one more.
There's a worse one.

2720
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:33,180
Tell everybody that garrison keillor 
story story.

2721
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:34,980
So by the way,
the only thing we have,

2722
02:29:34,981 --> 02:29:35,814
so he was fired from a Minnesota public 
radio is radio program was not only 

2723
02:29:40,650 --> 02:29:44,760
renamed but the old ones were 
disappeared.

2724
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:45,593
And mind you,
I don't give a damn about garrison 

2725
02:29:46,531 --> 02:29:47,970
keillor's radio program.
Right.

2726
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:53,010
But the only thing we have as an 
explanation is his own account.

2727
02:29:53,490 --> 02:29:56,310
Right.
So is there another side of the story?

2728
02:29:56,311 --> 02:29:57,144
I can't say,
but I must say the account had the ring 

2729
02:29:59,161 --> 02:30:04,050
of truth to it because it would have 
been very devastating if some compelling

2730
02:30:04,110 --> 02:30:04,943
counter narrative that emerged.
And the story he told was that he had 

2731
02:30:08,371 --> 02:30:10,890
been comforting a woman.
I think she may have lost somebody.

2732
02:30:11,330 --> 02:30:14,880
He had been comforting a woman and he 
had leaned in,

2733
02:30:14,881 --> 02:30:15,714
I guess to hug her and put his hand on 
her back and he said to her shirt was 

2734
02:30:20,911 --> 02:30:21,744
open and he touched her back and he said
his hand went up about six inches that 

2735
02:30:26,431 --> 02:30:30,180
she recoiled.
He apologized in the moment.

2736
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:33,750
He then sent her an email apologizing.
She said,

2737
02:30:33,870 --> 02:30:34,800
don't worry about it.

2738
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:35,633
It's not a big deal.
And he said that he and she were 

2739
02:30:39,031 --> 02:30:44,031
friendly until he got a contact from her
lawyers and how long after the event was

2740
02:30:45,931 --> 02:30:46,764
the.
Didn't say,

2741
02:30:47,460 --> 02:30:50,970
but my feeling is let's take the worst 
possible interpretation,

2742
02:30:50,971 --> 02:30:53,980
the least generous to keilor 
interpretation of this.

2743
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:55,530
Groped her a little bit.
Yeah.

2744
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:57,630
Maybe he lost his place.
Yeah.

2745
02:30:57,631 --> 02:31:01,140
Maybe just leaned in.
He leaned in for a moment.

2746
02:31:01,141 --> 02:31:05,400
He had a sexual thought or something.
You touched her back and then you know,

2747
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:08,550
he did what he should've done,
which just apologized.

2748
02:31:08,970 --> 02:31:11,580
She accepted the apology.
He still felt bad about it.

2749
02:31:11,581 --> 02:31:14,300
He apologized again.
And so anyways,

2750
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:15,970
just a back.
Right.

2751
02:31:16,030 --> 02:31:18,200
It's just batching.
So yeah.

2752
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:19,343
I'm not saying zero in the story,
but the idea that the guy's entire 

2753
02:31:21,781 --> 02:31:26,781
career is being erased from the radio 
archives because of this one story.

2754
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:29,490
If there's more,
there's more,

2755
02:31:29,491 --> 02:31:31,680
But if there ain't more,
that's really disturbing.

2756
02:31:31,910 --> 02:31:35,240
This would not have happened if it 
wasn't for like harvey weinstein,

2757
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:40,600
harvey weinstein,
who's his actions were so disgusting and

2758
02:31:41,301 --> 02:31:42,134
so egregious and so numerous,
so despicable that it went so far this 

2759
02:31:46,611 --> 02:31:51,611
way that anything even remotely gross 
got shifted into that category.

2760
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:57,480
Like into the kevin spacey category.
Kevin spacey's grabbing dixon

2761
02:31:59,590 --> 02:32:00,423
for now until our story came out on the 
same day of the garrison keillor story 

2762
02:32:03,591 --> 02:32:06,920
and that one is truly disturbing too.
I mean really just,

2763
02:32:07,540 --> 02:32:12,140
you know,
rape presumably legally,

2764
02:32:12,141 --> 02:32:15,170
but even if it wasn't what is described,
and again,

2765
02:32:15,171 --> 02:32:17,390
you know,
I'm a believer in due process.

2766
02:32:17,391 --> 02:32:19,610
I thought I just had affairs.
No,

2767
02:32:19,611 --> 02:32:20,031
no,
no.

2768
02:32:20,031 --> 02:32:22,880
There's really disturbing stuff 
including him.

2769
02:32:23,090 --> 02:32:23,923
I mean,
I want to be a little cautious about 

2770
02:32:25,401 --> 02:32:27,420
this business,
about him having a button under.

2771
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:29,750
They all have buttons.
That's a really common thing.

2772
02:32:29,751 --> 02:32:30,940
And nbc it is.
Yeah,

2773
02:32:30,941 --> 02:32:31,774
yeah,
yeah,

2774
02:32:32,180 --> 02:32:32,571
yeah.
See,

2775
02:32:32,571 --> 02:32:34,640
that's the problem with these chrome,
with the story,

2776
02:32:34,730 --> 02:32:37,700
but also it's not something you really 
want to go into and start reading.

2777
02:32:37,701 --> 02:32:38,534
You feel like you're gross is gross,
but I will say there was one story 

2778
02:32:42,710 --> 02:32:45,380
whether that button is a commonplace 
thing that's been misinterpreted.

2779
02:32:45,381 --> 02:32:46,214
I don't know,
but there is some story in which some 

2780
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:52,640
woman came into his office,
he had her bend over his desk,

2781
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:54,313
he had sex with her,
she fainted and he had his assistant 

2782
02:32:58,071 --> 02:32:59,570
take her to the hospital,
which,

2783
02:33:00,470 --> 02:33:02,860
you know.
Anyway,

2784
02:33:03,110 --> 02:33:05,110
yeah,
I now,

2785
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:07,640
because I can't establish that any of 
this stuff is true,

2786
02:33:07,641 --> 02:33:08,474
but I will say that killer story doesn't
sound like the loudest or it doesn't 

2787
02:33:11,061 --> 02:33:14,180
sound like the harvey weinstein story.
Uh,

2788
02:33:14,181 --> 02:33:15,440
or kevin spacey

2789
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:16,680
like al franken.
One,

2790
02:33:16,681 --> 02:33:19,650
one of the women said that he grabbed 
her waist,

2791
02:33:19,651 --> 02:33:20,484
he squoze the fat around her waist when 
and she was disturbed because even her 

2792
02:33:25,711 --> 02:33:28,410
husband is not allowed to touch her like
that in public.

2793
02:33:28,730 --> 02:33:29,563
Well,
I want to come back to al franken 

2794
02:33:30,201 --> 02:33:31,034
separately.
I believe we need a very separate 

2795
02:33:32,091 --> 02:33:33,430
category for franken.
But,

2796
02:33:33,790 --> 02:33:34,623
um,
I was going to tell you what was worse 

2797
02:33:35,451 --> 02:33:37,310
than the keeler story.
Go ahead.

2798
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:41,060
So the killer story is disturbing.
When I heard that one,

2799
02:33:41,061 --> 02:33:41,894
suddenly my feeling of safety based on 
the fact that I haven't grown up to 

2800
02:33:45,501 --> 02:33:46,334
anybody who didn't want to be groped,
vanished because suddenly it was open 

2801
02:33:50,121 --> 02:33:51,550
season.
Um,

2802
02:33:52,610 --> 02:33:57,320
but the story that disturbs me even more
is the matt taibbi story.

2803
02:33:58,530 --> 02:34:00,730
I don't know who that is.
I know who matt tilapia.

2804
02:34:00,810 --> 02:34:01,643
So matt taibbi rolling stone reporter 
who's been really excellent at 

2805
02:34:05,631 --> 02:34:06,464
confronting power,
especially in the financial sector and 

2806
02:34:09,050 --> 02:34:11,090
you know,
he's been very consistent on this,

2807
02:34:11,390 --> 02:34:12,223
apparently is a young man.
He was in Russia and he was publishing 

2808
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:20,920
satirical magazine,
I guess it was,

2809
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:23,380
and the sotiro satirical magazine.

2810
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:26,133
so there's the story that came out,
which was that he had written all of 

2811
02:34:30,101 --> 02:34:32,210
these things about,
uh,

2812
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:37,530
about assaulting women and mocking them.
It turned out he didn't do the writing.

2813
02:34:38,961 --> 02:34:39,794
He wAs his partner and that he and his 
partner were engaged in producing the 

2814
02:34:43,511 --> 02:34:48,511
satirical publication that was in fact 
mocking the culture of americans who had

2815
02:34:50,021 --> 02:34:50,854
gone over to Russia and were snort and 
tons of coke and a living it up as they 

2816
02:34:55,811 --> 02:35:00,811
were corrupting the society that had 
recently been freed from communism.

2817
02:35:01,151 --> 02:35:02,710
And so the.
The point is,

2818
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:04,173
this was a case in which the evidence 
against type ab was ironic because it 

2819
02:35:08,471 --> 02:35:09,304
was really tight eeb critiquing this bad
behavior amongst other men and so the 

2820
02:35:13,421 --> 02:35:14,590
reason that this,
you know,

2821
02:35:14,591 --> 02:35:16,930
I wouldn't know what to make of that 
story except that the person,

2822
02:35:16,931 --> 02:35:21,570
the journalist who started sorting this 
out interviewed both matt taibbi,

2823
02:35:21,571 --> 02:35:22,404
his girlfriend who worked at the 
publication and other women in the 

2824
02:35:25,181 --> 02:35:26,014
office soliciting stories about what had
happened in the office and the women in 

2825
02:35:30,821 --> 02:35:31,654
the office universally reported these 
guys were honorable and they weren't 

2826
02:35:35,081 --> 02:35:36,010
behaving this way.

2827
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:40,000
And this was all about a satire of these
bad folks.

2828
02:35:40,030 --> 02:35:43,600
And so anyway,
there's a way in which this story creeps

2829
02:35:43,601 --> 02:35:48,040
me out beyond any other.
Because the danger of losing.

2830
02:35:48,041 --> 02:35:48,821
You know,
matt taibbi.

2831
02:35:48,821 --> 02:35:52,690
There isn't another one in what he's 
doing is important and he's amazing.

2832
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:54,340
He's a brilliant writer.
Right.

2833
02:35:54,341 --> 02:35:55,350
And so,
you know,

2834
02:35:56,230 --> 02:35:59,020
I was a going to be pretty surprised if 
he was behaving this way,

2835
02:35:59,021 --> 02:35:59,854
but okay.
I've been surprised by a few of these 

2836
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:04,180
and it wasn't even necessarily behaving.
It was writing,

2837
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:06,460
it was writing,
but the fact that there's no,

2838
02:36:06,461 --> 02:36:07,294
they're there when you pursue the story.
There's no women who were in a position 

2839
02:36:10,481 --> 02:36:11,111
to say,
yeah,

2840
02:36:11,111 --> 02:36:14,380
actually he was kind of a dick said,
right.

2841
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,393
He didn't write it.
It was designed to lampoon people who 

2842
02:36:18,521 --> 02:36:19,354
were behaving badly in this context,
in exactly the way that the me too 

2843
02:36:22,331 --> 02:36:24,720
movement should applaud.
You

2844
02:36:25,090 --> 02:36:25,923
tweeted and quoted a woman who wrote 
something and I retweeted it as well 

2845
02:36:29,021 --> 02:36:30,430
when you did it,
which she said,

2846
02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:32,043
here's an unpopular opinion.
I'm actually not at all concerned about 

2847
02:36:35,891 --> 02:36:40,000
men who are falsely accused of sexual 
assault slash harassment.

2848
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:43,390
And you said,
rethink this.

2849
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:44,253
You know,
there's the idea that honorable men who 

2850
02:36:46,571 --> 02:36:47,404
are on your side could get caught up in 
this and you're not even remotely 

2851
02:36:49,631 --> 02:36:51,180
concerned.
Uh,

2852
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:54,940
I don't know if you follow the thread 
before she turned her page too private,

2853
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:57,940
but one of the more hilarious things,
they turned it on her saying,

2854
02:36:57,941 --> 02:37:02,050
what about men of color who are falsely 
accused and know we're not men of color?

2855
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:06,340
Why she felt the racism coming her way 
and Immediately acquiesced it was,

2856
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:09,370
it was fascinating because I'm watching 
the social dance,

2857
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:13,210
this weird peacocking of morals and it's
just,

2858
02:37:13,211 --> 02:37:15,900
it's so odd.
But I think that it's just

2859
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,340
like we're talking about what other 
things systems correct themselves.

2860
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:23,150
You find this,
this one terrible example,

2861
02:37:23,330 --> 02:37:24,163
and then everything sort of like it gets
washed out because of this one terrible 

2862
02:37:28,131 --> 02:37:30,410
example.
And then I feel like it'll settle,

2863
02:37:31,030 --> 02:37:32,960
you know?
I don't know.

2864
02:37:32,961 --> 02:37:36,350
I'm just guessing you're the biologist.
I do.

2865
02:37:37,130 --> 02:37:40,210
I'm disturbed that particular tweet 
you're talking about about,

2866
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:42,560
I don't care if some innocent men go 
down,

2867
02:37:42,770 --> 02:37:46,370
is based on one relatively easy to 
understand,

2868
02:37:46,371 --> 02:37:48,860
concluded,
but it misses the more important one.

2869
02:37:49,130 --> 02:37:53,180
So what she's effectively saying is 
there's been a ton of carnage.

2870
02:37:53,240 --> 02:37:54,073
Lots of women have suffered awful stuff 
at the hands of men who weren't 

2871
02:37:56,241 --> 02:37:57,074
accountable.
And so a few men who suffer some bad 

2872
02:37:58,521 --> 02:38:00,890
stuff is tiny in comparison.
We all get that,

2873
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:06,020
but that's a terrible idea because it's 
a team thing then is them.

2874
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:07,153
It's the worst idea because what you 
want is a system in which men are 

2875
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:16,300
honorable and if you allow men who are 
honorable to be skewered,

2876
02:38:17,331 --> 02:38:21,770
simply because some person often cynIcal
decides to go after them.

2877
02:38:21,990 --> 02:38:22,823
A,
you're going to eliminate all of the 

2878
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:27,320
courageous men from the system because 
all those people have enemies.

2879
02:38:27,740 --> 02:38:28,573
And so the point is,
anybody with an enemy suddenly has to 

2880
02:38:30,141 --> 02:38:32,180
fear an accusation that has no truth in 
it,

2881
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:35,510
that's going to be reflexively believed.
So if you want the system to work,

2882
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:36,463
the last thing you want to do is just 
decide it's fine for innocent people to 

2883
02:38:40,161 --> 02:38:41,330
go down with the ship.
Yeah.

2884
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:44,270
And to not have any respect for due 
process is just crazy.

2885
02:38:44,271 --> 02:38:45,104
I mean,
that's what you're going to go back to 

2886
02:38:46,221 --> 02:38:47,054
the mccarthy era.
You're going to go to the salem witch 

2887
02:38:48,021 --> 02:38:49,070
trials.
It is that,

2888
02:38:49,370 --> 02:38:50,480
it is that.
It is that.

2889
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:51,600
Yeah.
Um,

2890
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:53,113
I just hope it keeps our daughters and 
wives and girlfriends and mom's from 

2891
02:38:59,271 --> 02:39:00,770
being groped at work,
right?

2892
02:39:00,771 --> 02:39:02,900
I mean it might,
it might look the,

2893
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:03,873
I've always said this,
the environment of an office is so 

2894
02:39:06,741 --> 02:39:07,574
fucking entirely unnatural that it takes
incredible restraint just to key people 

2895
02:39:12,021 --> 02:39:12,854
from behaving in the way that they would
if they were surrounded by these people 

2896
02:39:15,951 --> 02:39:16,820
on a regular basis.

2897
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:19,670
And like we were talking about before 
with professors,

2898
02:39:19,671 --> 02:39:21,470
the relationship that a professor has 
with the student,

2899
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:25,760
but it's even more so with a boss and an
employee,

2900
02:39:25,910 --> 02:39:27,380
right?
a secretary,

2901
02:39:27,470 --> 02:39:31,060
someone who makes a fraction of what you
make or someone who's under,

2902
02:39:31,061 --> 02:39:31,894
you know,
the below you in the office food chain 

2903
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:38,830
and you kind of can dictate whether or 
not they do well in life.

2904
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:44,950
Whether or not they advance your input 
can change the course of their career,

2905
02:39:45,381 --> 02:39:46,214
how much money they make,
whether there'll be able to go on 

2906
02:39:47,361 --> 02:39:49,760
vacations,
whether they can live comfortably pursue

2907
02:39:49,761 --> 02:39:50,790
their dreams.
Well,

2908
02:39:50,930 --> 02:39:55,160
I mean it's a crazy environment.
The office environment is a very bizarre

2909
02:39:55,161 --> 02:39:57,890
environment.
It's super dangerous.

2910
02:39:57,950 --> 02:39:58,783
And what I keep waiting for,
maybe somebody who's written it and I 

2911
02:40:00,861 --> 02:40:03,150
haven't read it yet,
but the,

2912
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:07,400
the deep question.
So we have to deal with the issue of men

2913
02:40:07,401 --> 02:40:10,130
behaving this way.
Obviously it's completely unacceptable.

2914
02:40:10,220 --> 02:40:12,670
And you know,
we have two dangers.

2915
02:40:12,671 --> 02:40:13,504
We've got

2916
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:17,430
people cynically wielding these 
accusations and we also have,

2917
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:19,560
um,
predatory behavior,

2918
02:40:19,561 --> 02:40:23,850
crucifying people for infractions that 
don't amount to,

2919
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:26,100
you know,
the same tragedy,

2920
02:40:26,101 --> 02:40:27,480
right?
So anyway,

2921
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:30,240
um,
so those issues are important.

2922
02:40:30,241 --> 02:40:35,241
But what I want to see is that what 
happened is actually a consequence of an

2923
02:40:36,270 --> 02:40:37,103
unhealthy truth of our system.
It actually goes back to the 

2924
02:40:40,141 --> 02:40:40,974
conversation we were having before where
the power of men like harvey weinstein 

2925
02:40:46,741 --> 02:40:51,741
and matt lauer comes from a very 
unnatural concentration of opportunity.

2926
02:40:53,430 --> 02:40:58,430
So women have been compromised because 
if you're in the news business at was at

2927
02:40:58,651 --> 02:41:03,390
nbc and matt lauer tells you to open 
your blouse,

2928
02:41:03,630 --> 02:41:06,420
suddenly you're staring at a major 
career decision,

2929
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:08,610
right?
Do you say no?

2930
02:41:09,180 --> 02:41:14,180
Or do you say yes?
And that's one person is not supposed to

2931
02:41:15,091 --> 02:41:15,924
have that much power.
You should be able to walk out of nbc 

2932
02:41:19,381 --> 02:41:20,214
and say,
I'm not working there anymore because 

2933
02:41:21,210 --> 02:41:24,060
matt lauer's and ass and go somewhere 
else,

2934
02:41:24,061 --> 02:41:24,894
but if matt lauer is not only has the 
power to make a or well to make your 

2935
02:41:29,851 --> 02:41:30,684
career,
but he also has the power to break you 

2936
02:41:31,741 --> 02:41:33,840
because you can't,
you can't endure.

2937
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:36,570
Having said no to him,
then that's a tragedy.

2938
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:37,583
And in fact,
did you read the selma high x story on 

2939
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:42,120
harvey weinstein?
Terrifying.

2940
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,080
terrifying.
And I thought,

2941
02:41:44,081 --> 02:41:44,914
I mean a.
I thought it was very courageous of her 

2942
02:41:46,171 --> 02:41:47,004
to write it,
that she didn't need to because 

2943
02:41:48,690 --> 02:41:51,270
weinstein was already understood to be 
the monster today was.

2944
02:41:51,271 --> 02:41:53,160
And I actually thought she did a good 
job.

2945
02:41:53,250 --> 02:41:56,400
I mean he is a monster,
but she went.

2946
02:41:56,880 --> 02:42:00,840
She,
even though he was her monster,

2947
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:01,733
in her words,
she said that there were two harvey 

2948
02:42:06,091 --> 02:42:07,890
weinstein's and you didn't know which 
one you were going to get.

2949
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:08,753
So she actually,
she dealt with the part of him that 

2950
02:42:11,251 --> 02:42:12,084
wasn't this way apparently honorably 
enough to say that when nobody else was 

2951
02:42:15,031 --> 02:42:18,450
talking about.
So I don't wish to resurrect anything rv

2952
02:42:18,451 --> 02:42:19,284
weinstein here.
I think the guy is getting what he 

2953
02:42:20,311 --> 02:42:24,030
deserves and even though due process is 
super important in this case,

2954
02:42:24,031 --> 02:42:26,730
there's so many stories that it's 
impossible to imagine.

2955
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:27,990
Well,
it's not just stories,

2956
02:42:27,991 --> 02:42:31,080
it's actually written into his contract 
and the settlements,

2957
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:32,293
but the sexual harassment clauses in his
contract with the craziest things I've 

2958
02:42:35,401 --> 02:42:37,350
ever seen in my life.
Like they literally said,

2959
02:42:37,351 --> 02:42:38,184
if you have one infraction,
it's this amount of money to 

2960
02:42:39,451 --> 02:42:41,520
infractions.
It's half a million dollars,

2961
02:42:41,521 --> 02:42:44,670
three infractions monetized.
It's insane.

2962
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:45,533
And the point is while there's something
unhealthy about a system that creates 

2963
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,393
somebody so powerful that they are 
capable of just treating their own 

2964
02:42:54,241 --> 02:42:58,170
sexual assault of other people as a cost
of doing business by writing it into the

2965
02:42:58,171 --> 02:43:01,110
contract.
so w w we have to fix.

2966
02:43:01,111 --> 02:43:01,944
Not only do we hAve to fix that.
If you're a man and you behaved this 

2967
02:43:04,741 --> 02:43:05,880
way,
you're not safe.

2968
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:07,073
We also have to fix the system that let 
this go on so long by concentrating 

2969
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:13,990
opportunity so that any person who 
decided to say,

2970
02:43:13,991 --> 02:43:14,824
hey,
actually things are not healthy here 

2971
02:43:16,090 --> 02:43:21,090
would have been a not listened to 
because everybody else had stuff to lose

2972
02:43:21,251 --> 02:43:23,410
if harvey weinstein didn't like ya.
Um,

2973
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:28,900
and so anyway,
curing the concentration of opportunity.

2974
02:43:28,901 --> 02:43:33,290
Problem is part and parcel of solving 
the sexual

2975
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:35,250
assault problem.
Yeah.

2976
02:43:35,310 --> 02:43:39,680
And it's also this giant enterPrise.
Right?

2977
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:42,140
And when you have one person who's the 
king,

2978
02:43:42,590 --> 02:43:47,590
which is essentially what he was,
they behave like kings have classically.

2979
02:43:48,270 --> 02:43:51,020
I mean,
that's what kings do.

2980
02:43:51,021 --> 02:43:51,570
They,
they,

2981
02:43:51,570 --> 02:43:54,020
they want everyone they want.
You know what I mean?

2982
02:43:54,030 --> 02:43:54,863
You hear horrible stories throughout 
history of things that men do when they 

2983
02:43:58,101 --> 02:43:58,934
have ultimate power.
The old phrase ultimate power corrupts 

2984
02:44:03,320 --> 02:44:05,000
absolute power corrupts.
Absolutely.

2985
02:44:05,190 --> 02:44:06,030
Yeah.
It's just,

2986
02:44:06,050 --> 02:44:06,883
there's no way around it.
It seems like in less there's full 

2987
02:44:09,951 --> 02:44:14,951
disclosure and less.
I firmly believe that all of this is.

2988
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:21,160
There's two things going going on right 
now that we are in sort of an adolescent

2989
02:44:21,681 --> 02:44:26,681
stage of human evolution in terms of our
culture that we're working out,

2990
02:44:26,781 --> 02:44:28,490
how we Interact and behave with each 
other.

2991
02:44:28,850 --> 02:44:32,600
That information and the ability to 
exchange information is highlighting all

2992
02:44:32,601 --> 02:44:33,434
these flaws and these natural systems 
that we have with these alpha chimps 

2993
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:38,560
that are running these giant groups.
Um,

2994
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:44,080
but then I think this technology is that
it's exposing us is going to give way to

2995
02:44:44,121 --> 02:44:44,954
something that's even scarier.
And my number one fear over the last 

2996
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:50,470
year has been artificial intelligence.
Oh,

2997
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,410
I'm tremendously troubled by it.
I'm more scared of it every day.

2998
02:44:54,430 --> 02:44:58,700
Every day I wake up thinking,
are we just sleeping while this thing is

2999
02:44:58,701 --> 02:44:59,534
about to go live?
And we literally are in a fucking 

3000
02:45:02,241 --> 02:45:03,110
terminator movie.

3001
02:45:04,470 --> 02:45:07,380
I think it's both better and worse than 
that.

3002
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:10,560
We,
it's happening already.

3003
02:45:10,860 --> 02:45:12,990
And because it's not robots,
we don't see it.

3004
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:14,190
Right.
It's happening in your phone.

3005
02:45:14,390 --> 02:45:15,730
It's your,
it's your phone.

3006
02:45:15,740 --> 02:45:16,890
Yeah.
And the thing is,

3007
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:19,870
it's a tie.
It's not a gi,

3008
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:22,950
right?
So age being general.

3009
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,360
Okay.
So the fear,

3010
02:45:24,361 --> 02:45:26,730
the one that we have sentient,
yeah,

3011
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:27,593
that the thing is smart enough to start 
thinking on its own and that it might 

3012
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:33,960
come up with its own,
be creative,

3013
02:45:34,230 --> 02:45:36,930
it might be creative and either 
misunder,

3014
02:45:36,931 --> 02:45:37,764
you know the paperclip problem is you 
tell it to make as many paperclips as 

3015
02:45:40,831 --> 02:45:41,664
possible and it sees your attempt to 
turn it off or reprogram it as an 

3016
02:45:45,031 --> 02:45:48,600
obstacle to making paperclips and it 
just starts to liquidating the universe.

3017
02:45:48,870 --> 02:45:52,140
So that's not a malevolent ai.
That's a confused ai.

3018
02:45:53,310 --> 02:45:58,310
Malevolent ai is also possible,
but what we've got is a baby version.

3019
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:01,133
The algorithms causing us to become 
addicted to our phones and to do damage 

3020
02:46:05,551 --> 02:46:10,551
to our lives is ai.
These algorithms that are developing,

3021
02:46:10,751 --> 02:46:13,790
I mean frankly it doesn't even matter 
whether People are reprogramming them or

3022
02:46:13,791 --> 02:46:14,624
whether they are reprogramming 
themselves and it is undoubtedly a 

3023
02:46:16,671 --> 02:46:17,504
mixture.
What we have is a evolutionary system 

3024
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:25,580
that the winner will be the site that 
manages to capture your attention in the

3025
02:46:25,581 --> 02:46:26,414
face of competitors who are tryIng to do
the same thing and they will build 

3026
02:46:28,970 --> 02:46:31,700
anything and everything into that 
algorithm to get you to do it,

3027
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:34,910
which means there's nothing in your life
that sacred right.

3028
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:38,840
Your life can be liquidated to get you 
addicted to that side on the phone.

3029
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:39,973
What we have now is a case where the 
algorithms aren't so good that we can't 

3030
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:44,713
have this conversation,
recognize that this is a danger we've 

3031
02:46:47,421 --> 02:46:49,700
created for ourselves and address it.

3032
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:50,533
we could address it now,
but if we don't realize that the phone 

3033
02:46:54,110 --> 02:46:58,220
algorithm addiction problem is,
this is the warning shot,

3034
02:46:58,250 --> 02:47:02,570
this is the place where we get a chance 
to recognize where we're headed and deal

3035
02:47:02,571 --> 02:47:06,680
with it before it's agi.
If we don't do that,

3036
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:08,293
I don't.
EveryBody who's serious and has thought 

3037
02:47:10,521 --> 02:47:13,010
about this question has had the same,
oh shit.

3038
02:47:13,011 --> 02:47:18,011
rational conclusion is that we.
There's no stopping this.

3039
02:47:18,900 --> 02:47:19,733
There's.
we can rationally debate how far off it 

3040
02:47:21,381 --> 02:47:24,320
is,
but once it gets going,

3041
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:28,520
there's essentially no good.
there's no good way out,

3042
02:47:28,521 --> 02:47:30,920
so there's no one that's going to agree 
to stop right now.

3043
02:47:31,730 --> 02:47:33,800
Right?
It's too much competition involved in.

3044
02:47:33,801 --> 02:47:38,660
In terms of the the you have.
there's so many resources that are on on

3045
02:47:38,661 --> 02:47:41,000
so much resources.
There's so much power.

3046
02:47:41,150 --> 02:47:46,150
There's so much money on the line to see
who can come up with the best version of

3047
02:47:46,671 --> 02:47:47,504
this and do it the quickest and it's 
this mad race towards the edge of a 

3048
02:47:50,181 --> 02:47:53,330
cliff and no one exactly knows whether 
or not we're going to be able to use the

3049
02:47:53,331 --> 02:47:54,050
brakes.

3050
02:47:54,050 --> 02:47:54,883
Right,
and so in some ways I think this is the 

3051
02:47:57,440 --> 02:47:58,273
the ultimate demonstration of where we 
are and what we must contemplate in 

3052
02:48:03,591 --> 02:48:04,424
order to save ourselves.
Because if we can agree that the ai 

3053
02:48:07,821 --> 02:48:12,290
problem has the potential to destroy us 
and that given time,

3054
02:48:12,291 --> 02:48:13,124
it will have the power to destroy us and
that we are vague at best on what 

3055
02:48:17,451 --> 02:48:20,270
mechanisms might prevent it from doing 
so.

3056
02:48:20,271 --> 02:48:23,990
But then we've got this loophole which 
is well as oppose.

3057
02:48:23,991 --> 02:48:24,824
You took 99 percent of the ai projects 
and manage to correctly build in some 

3058
02:48:29,810 --> 02:48:33,470
algorithm that prevented them from going
rogue in one way or the other,

3059
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:38,560
but somebody else decides not to.
So we have to confront this at the level

3060
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:42,260
of what is allowed.
Right.

3061
02:48:42,261 --> 02:48:46,160
I don't like hearing myself say that 
because I hear people turning off on the

3062
02:48:46,161 --> 02:48:47,510
other end when they hear,
oh,

3063
02:48:47,511 --> 02:48:51,740
he doesn't want to allow us to innovate,
but for the survival of the species,

3064
02:48:51,741 --> 02:48:52,910
I think it's imperative.
We have.

3065
02:48:53,020 --> 02:48:53,853
We have about.
We have no choice and so scared that 

3066
02:48:56,241 --> 02:48:57,074
we're caught up in all this other 
nonsense and we're thinking about so 

3067
02:48:59,451 --> 02:49:01,220
much stupid shit and our life like you 
know,

3068
02:49:01,250 --> 02:49:05,240
whether or not kim and kanye stay 
together and in the middle of all this,

3069
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:08,040
there's a lab right now and they're 
connecting

3070
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:08,873
these wires and connecting these dots 
and reprogramming and accelerating the 

3071
02:49:12,691 --> 02:49:13,524
evolution of this thing and it's not 
going to turn off and that life as we 

3072
02:49:17,851 --> 02:49:18,684
know it,
we will only have a few layers left to 

3073
02:49:20,221 --> 02:49:21,054
this.
I really feel like we're in a fucking 

3074
02:49:21,961 --> 02:49:22,794
science fiction movie and we're at the 
beginning of the movie where 

3075
02:49:24,901 --> 02:49:27,230
everything's great.
We got problems,

3076
02:49:27,250 --> 02:49:30,110
we got a lot of dudes out there pinch 
and butts and some.

3077
02:49:30,480 --> 02:49:33,810
Some dudes are pretty rapey and we got 
rid of the kevin spacey,

3078
02:49:33,811 --> 02:49:34,644
got taken out of that movie.
We're doing pretty good and then in the 

3079
02:49:36,211 --> 02:49:37,044
meanwhile there's fucking robots that 
are being built by boss dynamic that 

3080
02:49:40,471 --> 02:49:43,680
does back flips and they're gonna be 
able to think for themselves and they're

3081
02:49:43,681 --> 02:49:44,514
going to have machine guns for hands and
their body's going to be filled with 

3082
02:49:46,801 --> 02:49:47,940
bullets.
What could go wrong?

3083
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:49,193
It'S fucking crazy because it's 
happening at such an accelerated rate 

3084
02:49:52,890 --> 02:49:55,890
that it's literally what I'm.
I'll be sitting around,

3085
02:49:56,040 --> 02:49:59,310
I'll be playing with my kids,
I'll be hanging out and I'll be like,

3086
02:49:59,311 --> 02:50:00,990
fuck.
Are they making robots right now?

3087
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:02,040
Is that.
Are we.

3088
02:50:02,050 --> 02:50:05,220
Are we like a year away from this being 
a real problem?

3089
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:09,510
Well this is.
this is kinda what I'm getting at.

3090
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:12,480
Is that the ai problem?
In some ways,

3091
02:50:12,481 --> 02:50:13,314
maybe it's good because it's causing us 
to be able to focus on one of these 

3092
02:50:17,131 --> 02:50:19,980
hazards to us that you,
you can't.

3093
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:23,880
Once you've seen why this was a risk,
once you've really made eye contact with

3094
02:50:23,881 --> 02:50:24,714
it,
you can't talk yourself into why it's 

3095
02:50:25,861 --> 02:50:26,760
safe,
right?

3096
02:50:26,761 --> 02:50:29,850
Because it can't possibly be right.
And if 99 percent of them are safe,

3097
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:32,310
one percent is enough to create the 
problem.

3098
02:50:32,610 --> 02:50:35,580
So once you've,
once you've got that information,

3099
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:36,593
you can then begin to extrapolate to all
of the other problems that don't have 

3100
02:50:40,261 --> 02:50:41,820
the same,
um,

3101
02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:44,460
the same intrigue around them.
You know,

3102
02:50:44,461 --> 02:50:49,461
there's something sam harris makes the 
point that as you talk about the,

3103
02:50:49,831 --> 02:50:51,390
you know,
the ai apocalypse,

3104
02:50:51,530 --> 02:50:54,550
it is simultaneously horrifying but kind
of fun to,

3105
02:50:55,170 --> 02:50:56,580
to get into because,
you know,

3106
02:50:56,581 --> 02:50:57,414
because it is sort of scifi and all,
but the whole landscape that we have 

3107
02:51:02,071 --> 02:51:03,160
built,
right?

3108
02:51:03,240 --> 02:51:04,073
Our sociopolitical landscape was built 
by people who had never heard of 

3109
02:51:08,370 --> 02:51:10,410
darwinists.
There was no darwinism.

3110
02:51:10,830 --> 02:51:11,663
they didn't know.
And so they Built a bunch of ecosystems 

3111
02:51:15,660 --> 02:51:18,840
in which stuff evolves and they didn't 
know to worry about it.

3112
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:24,210
So the ai problem is a very concentrated
version of a very general problem,

3113
02:51:24,211 --> 02:51:25,044
which is if you build a habitat and you 
install into it those features which 

3114
02:51:28,171 --> 02:51:32,790
caused evolution to occur,
it will occur and what it will create is

3115
02:51:32,791 --> 02:51:36,120
entirely a question of what the niches 
look like that you have left open.

3116
02:51:36,630 --> 02:51:37,463
So we are living that we are suffering 
the consequence of an economic 

3117
02:51:41,221 --> 02:51:42,054
environment that is evolutionary,
that creates a giant rent seeking 

3118
02:51:46,681 --> 02:51:50,640
monsters who are liquidating our 
wellbeing and putting it into their bank

3119
02:51:50,641 --> 02:51:51,474
accounts and we've created a political 
apparatus that has the same 

3120
02:51:54,330 --> 02:51:55,163
characteristics and now we're facing a 
robot version that actually has the 

3121
02:52:00,451 --> 02:52:03,000
potential to very rapidly push us over 
the cliff.

3122
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:05,980
My real issue with this,
and this is something

3123
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:08,770
that I've been battling again with for a
couple of years now,

3124
02:52:08,830 --> 02:52:09,663
is that the.
This is what we do and it's one of the 

3125
02:52:11,921 --> 02:52:14,920
reasons why we're so fascinated with 
technological innovation.

3126
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:15,993
I mean they literally.
We are the caterpillar that is becoming 

3127
02:52:18,941 --> 02:52:19,774
the electronic butterfly and we don't 
realize it while we're doing it and 

3128
02:52:22,481 --> 02:52:24,400
we're so obsessed with the newest,
latest,

3129
02:52:24,401 --> 02:52:26,560
greatest phone that really doesn't 
change your life at all.

3130
02:52:26,890 --> 02:52:28,210
Like,
I got this new iphone.

3131
02:52:28,211 --> 02:52:29,410
It's pretty.
It's great.

3132
02:52:29,710 --> 02:52:31,810
I eat do the same shit I did in my old 
iphone,

3133
02:52:31,811 --> 02:52:33,310
but I was so pumped to get it,
man.

3134
02:52:33,580 --> 02:52:34,413
But you're in some ways facilitating the
evolution of this technology that will 

3135
02:52:38,350 --> 02:52:41,410
ultimately lead.
If you follow it to an end point,

3136
02:52:41,860 --> 02:52:43,990
it's going to lead to something very,
very bizarre.

3137
02:52:43,991 --> 02:52:45,370
I mean,
if you're ray kurzweil,

3138
02:52:45,371 --> 02:52:46,204
you think it's going to be wonderful and
you've got to be able to download your 

3139
02:52:47,801 --> 02:52:50,320
brain into a computer,
but if you were a lot of other people,

3140
02:52:50,321 --> 02:52:53,740
you think it's an absolutely terrifying 
thing that's going to eventually lead to

3141
02:52:53,830 --> 02:52:55,030
us being irrelevant

3142
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:56,273
and this is unnecessary.
So likely we won't have time to go very 

3143
02:53:01,081 --> 02:53:01,914
far into it,
but we have an alternative and I think 

3144
02:53:05,701 --> 02:53:09,210
it does look a little bit like lars 
anderson with his fancy archery,

3145
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:10,193
you know,
which is we are just on the cusp of 

3146
02:53:13,801 --> 02:53:14,634
understanding enough about what a human 
being is and how it functions for us to 

3147
02:53:18,841 --> 02:53:23,841
actually take control of our structure 
and to turn it to our,

3148
02:53:25,090 --> 02:53:30,090
to basically creating a stable non 
utopian abundant system.

3149
02:53:31,590 --> 02:53:34,620
In other words,
the stuff that we are all pursuing,

3150
02:53:35,100 --> 02:53:35,933
right?
You've got your first smartphone and it 

3151
02:53:37,681 --> 02:53:38,514
changed everything and it was marvelous.
And then your second one didn't change 

3152
02:53:41,341 --> 02:53:42,174
that much in your third one was no big 
deal on your fourth one is barely a 

3153
02:53:44,281 --> 02:53:45,120
blip.
Right?

3154
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:48,510
Um,
that thing that we are pursuing,

3155
02:53:48,511 --> 02:53:52,380
the wellbeing that we felt the burst of 
when we got our first,

3156
02:53:52,650 --> 02:53:57,180
our first smart phones,
that thing can be made to.

3157
02:53:57,990 --> 02:53:58,823
The system can be made such that we are 
constantly getting the signals of 

3158
02:54:02,521 --> 02:54:07,410
wellbeing and the liberty to do things 
that are of consequence.

3159
02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:08,993
In other words,
it is not beyond our current 

3160
02:54:10,891 --> 02:54:11,724
understanding to build a system that 
instead of getting you to innovate 

3161
02:54:16,651 --> 02:54:18,960
something,
having a huge burst of dopamine and then

3162
02:54:18,961 --> 02:54:21,600
it wears out and you're constantly 
looking for the next one.

3163
02:54:21,810 --> 02:54:25,760
It is possible to build a system that,
um,

3164
02:54:27,270 --> 02:54:28,103
is structured such that your intuitive 
interaction with it is healthy so that 

3165
02:54:32,401 --> 02:54:35,250
you are feeling about that is something 
I want to engage with.

3166
02:54:35,251 --> 02:54:36,084
That is something I don't feel like 
engaging with actually leads you 

3167
02:54:38,251 --> 02:54:39,084
correctly through it.
And that would free your mind to think 

3168
02:54:42,301 --> 02:54:44,550
about interesting things rather than 
thinking about,

3169
02:54:44,850 --> 02:54:48,810
you know,
which news magazine is the least fake,

3170
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:54,800
right?
So I'm architecting a system that is,

3171
02:54:56,130 --> 02:54:56,963
that understands what a human being is 
that understands we are not built to be 

3172
02:55:01,410 --> 02:55:02,243
happy and therefore pursuing happiness 
as if we were built to be happy is a 

3173
02:55:07,821 --> 02:55:08,654
hazard.

3174
02:55:08,990 --> 02:55:09,823
We should be pursuing something else And
we should recognize that happiness is a 

3175
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:15,260
carrot on a stick.
That,

3176
02:55:15,440 --> 02:55:16,273
that evolution built into us in order to
get us to pursue objectives which were 

3177
02:55:19,581 --> 02:55:20,414
not stable wellbeing.
They were actually the spread of our 

3178
02:55:23,571 --> 02:55:26,120
genomes,
which you can attach to technology.

3179
02:55:26,121 --> 02:55:26,954
This pursuit of happiness is the pursuit
of material possessions and we 

3180
02:55:30,801 --> 02:55:33,590
facilitate that with these 
advertisements that make every new thing

3181
02:55:33,591 --> 02:55:36,350
look like this is the one that's going 
to take me over the top.

3182
02:55:36,410 --> 02:55:38,330
I'm going to finally reach the promised 
land.

3183
02:55:38,810 --> 02:55:39,830
Well,
we.

3184
02:55:39,950 --> 02:55:40,783
Technology is one thing really.
We are built to pursue a something that 

3185
02:55:47,750 --> 02:55:48,583
economists called growth,
but I would say human beings like all 

3186
02:55:52,341 --> 02:55:53,174
creatures are built to detect 
opportunities that they can capitalize 

3187
02:55:57,111 --> 02:55:59,840
on and those opportunities can look like
various different things.

3188
02:55:59,841 --> 02:56:01,810
It can look like a bunch of,
you know,

3189
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:02,653
for some creature foraging,
it can be some food that it happens 

3190
02:56:05,700 --> 02:56:06,530
onto.

3191
02:56:06,530 --> 02:56:09,740
For a population of humans that can be a
new continent.

3192
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:12,890
That's a huge opportunity for human 
beings.

3193
02:56:12,891 --> 02:56:13,724
It can also be a new technology that 
takes whatever opportunity you have and 

3194
02:56:16,821 --> 02:56:18,260
make.
It allows you to do more with it.

3195
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:19,453
But we are wired to search for those 
things and the pursuit of those things 

3196
02:56:24,111 --> 02:56:29,111
has produced a great many marvelous 
innovations and discoveries,

3197
02:56:30,530 --> 02:56:31,363
but the fact that we do not understand 
that we are mindlessly pursuing these 

3198
02:56:36,291 --> 02:56:37,124
things,
even when they are not available causes 

3199
02:56:38,571 --> 02:56:39,404
us to do all sorts of harm to ourselves.
So understanding these things as We 

3200
02:56:44,091 --> 02:56:44,924
finally are beginning to,
we could buIld a civilization that did 

3201
02:56:47,811 --> 02:56:51,920
not leave us on the hedonic treadmill,
pursuing happiness which cannot possibly

3202
02:56:51,921 --> 02:56:52,754
be reached,
but would allow us to be fulfilled and 

3203
02:56:56,451 --> 02:56:57,284
to to utilize the amazing brain capacity
that evolution has given us for 

3204
02:57:01,431 --> 02:57:05,570
something that's actually worthy of it.
Bret weinstein on that note,

3205
02:57:05,780 --> 02:57:07,130
let's wrap this bitch up.

Thank you so much.
I hope.

3208
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:13,010
I hope someone can actually do this.
I hope it can be done.

3209
02:57:13,070 --> 02:57:14,090
Awesome.
Thank you.

3211
02:57:15,230 --> 02:57:18,600
Thank you bret weinstein on twitter and 
you don't have

3212

but those other things and don't use 
those other terrible technology.
