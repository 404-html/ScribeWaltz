1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,330
Doo doo,
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,860
Boom.
Yes.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,050
We're live.
Hello,

4
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:12,700
Eric.
Hello Joe.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,010
Thanks for doing this,
man.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,930
I'm.
Jamie had a question.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,970
You're,
you're not related to that.

8
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,730
Other fellow to other one team fell.
It's in trouble right now.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,020
Bret Weinstein.
No.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,550
That's your brother.
The other guy.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,730
Weinstein or the other guy?
Yeah.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,210
I don't know him.
Okay.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,960
That other guy's in trouble.
Like two more women.

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,870
Angelina Jolie and they both came out 
today.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,520
Yeah.
I don't think it's going to stop there.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,670
Uh,
seems like you might've had a little bit

17
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:46,120
of an issue and that amazing that 
someone can get away with something like

18
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:46,954
that for so long and then one or two 
people come clean and the walls come 

19
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:52,264
down.
The oppressive fist of just his fucking 

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,560
tyranny,
whatever that guy did.

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,611
Yeah.
I mean,

22
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,444
I think it does speak to the idea that 
power really exists in an industry in a 

23
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:06,760
town like this.

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,370
It's always been the.
That's been the Cliche,

25
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:11,020
right?
The casting couch,

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,950
right?
Yes.

27
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,860
But I didn't know in the modern era how 
much,

28
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,190
uh,
how much power any still had.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,840
Yeah.
I wonder,

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,310
you know,
it's just,

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,270
and it's also like super left wing guy,
you know,

32
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:29,920
like really politically connected to 
social justice ideologies,

33
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,690
fighting gun control.
I mean,

34
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,524
you know,
promoting gun control and stumping for 

35
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:37,840
Hillary and all this.
Yeah,

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,103
it seems like overcompensation.
I didn't want to bring this up right up 

37
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,320
front about that.
We were going to talk about cuddle fish.

38
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,183
I asked you to save the cuttlefish and 
just cuddled conversation about little 

39
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,734
fish.

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,250
Well,
we were talking about,

41
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,310
I mean all of these are just incredible 
hot button topics,

42
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,800
but we were talking before about your 
Ra,

43
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,703
your conversation on um,
male and female programming in the mind 

44
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,410
on male and female,
a biological frames.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,560
And what I was,
what I was going to talk about there was

46
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,443
that you can actually have in other 
species which aren't nearly as 

47
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,284
controversial as humans.
I'm irrational basis for something like 

48
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,530
transphobia in an evolutionary context.
So the giant cuttle fish,

49
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,250
which I think is called Sepia Pama.
I'm not a biologist.

50
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,803
I'm the males are incredibly large.
They're very sexually dimorphic and 

51
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,133
you've got these tiny or smaller males 
who don't have a good strategy for 

52
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:46,294
keeping a lot of females underneath them
were so the males are incredibly larger 

53
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:55,330
that females are incredibly large.
The females tend to be much smaller when

54
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:56,164
the females are impressed.
They accept shelter underneath one of 

55
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,624
these giant males,
but then you have these other males who 

56
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,320
aren't nearly as big,
um,

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,590
which might be called sneaker males.

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,600
And the sneaker males start retracting 
the tentacles that identify them as male

59
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,510
and changing through their chromatin 
fours.

60
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,450
They're sort of their presentation to 
look female.

61
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,943
And then the giant males invite these 
males disguised as females through 

62
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,630
behavioral change underneath.
And we've now proven,

63
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,800
I believe that these sneaker males 
inseminate the females.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,360
Well,
the larger males are getting duped now.

65
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,194
Are the larger males larger because they
just have better genetics or are they 

66
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,060
larger because they're older?
Well,

67
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,460
you know,
the question about better genetics.

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,530
Key question is who leaves the lineages 
that matter over time?

69
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
So if you're wasting all of your energy 
on a strategy,

70
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,213
and in fact what you're doing is you're 
providing protection for sneaker males 

71
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:03,814
to get busy with the females who seemed 
to be equally happy to reward a devious 

72
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,720
male as a strong one.
You know,

73
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm a put in mind of the old,
the Willie Dixon Blues Song.

74
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,050
I'm a backdoor man.
The men don't know,

75
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,780
but the little girls understand,
um,

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,660
you know,
definitely a female's favor.

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,610
A variety of strategies,
whether communicating strengthened,

78
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,990
dominance,
cleverness,

79
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,040
a or anything that females are likely to
decide,

80
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,690
uh,
will benefit their offspring.

81
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,370
Yeah,
that's a,

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,070
that's a great name for them to sneaker 
males.

83
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,770
Is that like the tactical mail at the 
technical term for those small males?

84
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,060
I've seen it in lizards and I don't know
the Sepia Pama giant cuttle fish system,

85
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,740
but I'm,
I'm obsessed with cephalopod,

86
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,840
so I should probably go back and do some
homework on them.

87
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,190
I didn't know we would be starting out 
with Harvey Weinstein again.

88
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,323
Giant,
giant cuttle fish Weinstein versus 

89
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,080
Weinstein.
That's the difference.

90
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,820
I'm definitely keeping that distinction.
Yeah,

91
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,800
it's a good distinction now.
Right now.

92
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,933
It's good to make a separation.
So I'm cephalopods including cuttlefish 

93
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,850
octopus,
squids,

94
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,803
novelists,
and then they all sort of came from 

95
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,580
mollusks,
right?

96
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,580
This is the craziest thing in the world,
right?

97
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:22,260
I mean,
we're not,

98
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,360
we're not guaranteed to meet an alien 
intelligence during our lifetimes,

99
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,130
but the idea that such genius exists in 
mollusks where you least expect it and,

100
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,270
um,
is probably the closest we're ever going

101
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,800
to get to aliens.
So,

102
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,590
I mean,
I think that it's sort of,

103
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,210
there's a secret,
uh,

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,480
international conspiracy,
um,

105
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,780
people who have realized this and,
you know,

106
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,820
just freak out on cephalopods and they 
know,

107
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,720
they know every crazy thing that 
cephalopods have been proven to,

108
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,370
to understand and um,

109
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,710
you know,
where their cognitive capabilities,

110
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:03,110
uh,
just sort of wow us,

111
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,320
have the cognitive capabilities,
their camouflage capabilities,

112
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,490
the strategies that they use for 
attacking a bait fish.

113
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,324
And there's a video that I put up on my 
twitter really recently have a cuddle 

114
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:20,141
fish that opens up like a flower and 
shoots its tongue out and gets this fish

115
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,014
and then just sucks it into his body.
And it's like you're looking at some 

116
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,450
kind of an alien that's totally an mean,
I forget,

117
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,770
is that like seven fold symmetry or you 
know,

118
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,643
it's really on a different branch of the
phylogenetic tree and I think that the 

119
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,704
dazzled patterns where you just start 
seeing these neon signs that are 

120
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,234
effectively made out of the chromatin 
fours and if you've seen the videos 

121
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:43,514
where people put them on against like 
really artificial patterns like chess 

122
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:49,820
boards or Chins are things and the 
cuttlefish has to figure out,

123
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,290
okay,
how do I blend in with that?

124
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

125
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:56,210
And they do their best to market,
but the natural world,

126
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,560
they mimicked perfectly well not really.
I think was it octopus can do it,

127
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,920
some octopus can do it.
I think what happens is the pie.

128
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,240
Yeah,
that's,

129
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,160
I don't know that one.
Um,

130
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,253
I guess it's Octopi.
I think what they do is they actually 

131
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,630
sort of do much less than we are 
imagining.

132
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,650
And they used the fact that we,
our brains are interpolated.

133
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,973
So they're in part,
not matching the background as well as 

134
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,224
we think,
but they're doing it well enough that 

135
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,290
our brains sort of make up the 
difference.

136
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,900
That's weird.
I mean,

137
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,060
but what,
what would be the difference between the

138
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,130
way we interpret their,
their visual,

139
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,221
uh,
what,

140
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:39,054
what,
what,

141
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,890
whatever camouflage they're giving off 
because it's a visual camouflage,

142
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:43,581
right?
Yeah.

143
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,560
If you look at some of the,
uh,

144
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,390
some of the camouflage videos,
like the first seven times you see it,

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,470
you can't imagine.

146
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,580
Yeah.
Uh,

147
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,740
but then after,
after awhile you say,

148
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,360
Oh wow,
there really is a difference.

149
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,450
And Somehow,
um,

150
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,710
I just,
I did the interpolation to help out that

151
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,260
which is trying to escape my detection.
Well,

152
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:09,230
I mean there's definitely a distinction 
you can kinda tell once you look at it,

153
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:13,010
but it's so insanely impressive and 
comparison to pretty much,

154
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,170
almost every other life form.
You know,

155
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:18,140
what they can do in terms of like they 
could change their texture.

156
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,370
That's one of the,
like when they,

157
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:22,820
when they sit on a coral reef and they 
start looking like a coral reef,

158
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:23,654
like,
whoa.

159
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,800
Have you,
uh,

160
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,290
have you checked out the mimic octupus?
Yes.

161
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,850
Right.
So that one,

162
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,590
five or six different disguises.
Yeah.

163
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,400
Uh,
I,

164
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,020
I can't even imagine that.
Usually when you have mimicry,

165
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,120
it's dedicated or obligate like a,
you know,

166
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:42,500
a stick bug or a leaf insect.
It's only going to do that one trick.

167
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:42,951
You,
you know,

168
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:43,784
what's interesting too is like I've 
heard a real legitimate argument for 

169
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:46,874
people that are opposed to eating animal
protein that a mollusks especially like 

170
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:56,070
clams and mussels and things along those
lines are more primitive

171
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,260
in terms of their ability to recognize 
or have any,

172
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,780
any sense of what pain is,
any sort of communication,

173
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:08,781
any sort of interpretation of danger 
that all they do is just close.

174
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,043
Right.
And that in closing we've interpreted 

175
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:16,040
that to being an animal and that this 
animal life form is like,

176
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,230
it's like eating a living thing versus 
like eating plants.

177
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,290
But I've heard it argued it actually.
Sam Harris was the first one to bring it

178
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,124
up.
This is actually a moral argument that 

179
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,700
they sense less than plants do and that 
they are more,

180
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,030
they're more primitive than plants are,
but yet from the [inaudible] family,

181
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,233
you have octopus and there's a good 
argument that you probably shouldn't be 

182
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,850
knocked a post.
Like you shouldn't beat monkeys,

183
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,940
you know,
like an octopus is fucking smart.

184
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,440
Like crazy.
Sneaky.

185
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:47,610
Smart.
It's them or us,

186
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,870
Joe.
Oh,

187
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,400
that's good.
I mean,

188
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,170
in that case they are delicious.
Yeah.

189
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,090
I think if you ever look at Humboldt 
Squid,

190
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,990
um,
you know,

191
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,590
schooling and descending as one of the 
greatest nightmares of all time.

192
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:02,490
I think I've seen a humboldt squid as a 
humboldt squid sometimes if we get.

193
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,324
They called the red devils are the coast
of Baja California and they're just 

194
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,203
social in.
They're terrifying because they attack 

195
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,194
in groups.
So the planet or the coordinate in some 

196
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:16,910
way

197
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,840
in some way.
I mean,

198
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,920
obviously the chromatophores must have 
some ability to do signaling.

199
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,010
And I think that with respect to w,
we have to figure out,

200
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,123
um,
whether it's really intelligence that 

201
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:35,891
causes us to become empathic because 
obviously if you're at war and you think

202
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:37,064
highly of your enemy,
you have to guard against your own 

203
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:41,750
empathy so that you can be an effective 
warrior.

204
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,030
You have to ask the question,
uh,

205
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,923
you know,
if monkeys and apes are among the most 

206
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:48,224
intelligent beings,
do I actually feel some revulsion for 

207
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:56,030
just how savage chimpanzees are as 
compared to say bonobos are givens.

208
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,220
Yeah.
Isn't that the real argument or the,

209
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,054
the real fascinating conversation is 
what happened on in the evolutionary 

210
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:04,494
chain.
Like why did banabos become these 

211
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:11,421
peaceful sexual creatures and champs 
become these warring savage psychos,

212
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,740
like what they look so similar.
Like what happened?

213
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,651
Well,
that,

214
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,230
that one,

215
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,063
no,
but there's an interesting system in 

216
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:22,510
Dung.
Beetles were,

217
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,603
um,
if you look at the armaments that they 

218
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:28,620
have on their head,
um,

219
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,110
uh,
for warring between males,

220
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,393
there's a conserved quantity between the
length of the Copula Tory apparatus and 

221
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,000
the size of the weaponry.
So the more weapons,

222
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,840
the smaller the penises.
And so,

223
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,883
you know,
there are all these crazy tradeoffs in 

224
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,740
apes between relative testicular size,
in peanut size

225
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,100
for gorillas,
gorillas have tiny little

226
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,933
penises,
but enormous bodies and giant fangs and 

227
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,930
tiny penis.
Yeah,

228
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,260
I guess.
Yeah.

229
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,710
And chimpanzees have big penises and 
testicles both.

230
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,720
Yeah.
See they said that chimpanzees,

231
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:08,554
there's a direct correlation between 
promiscuous females and the size of 

232
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,530
their testicles.
Hmm.

233
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,820
I don't,
I don't remember that one.

234
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,170
But yeah,
the question about.

235
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,550
I also worry that we've,
um,

236
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,780
we've idealized the banabos too much and
you know,

237
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,900
we were sort of,
it's very hard to be empathetic with the

238
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:32,740
chimps after Jane Goodall showed us what
they're capable of.

239
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,290
Um,
but in part,

240
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,390
uh,
you know,

241
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,010
the,
the cold logic of the natural world,

242
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,693
um,

243
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,180
in general,
you know,

244
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,760
it's usually some reason that makes 
complete sense.

245
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:49,874
It's,
it can't be sentimental anytime you 

246
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:53,010
bring sentimentality,
uh,

247
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,030
and you usually screw up a good theory.
Um,

248
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,640
and so,
you know,

249
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,510
I,
I,

250
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,110
I worry that our comparisons are driven 
by our needs to,

251
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,260
to locate ourselves a farther away from 
chimpanzees and closer to something that

252
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,010
we,
we feel comfortable.

253
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,083
So are idealizing the Banabos is not 
necessarily based on what they actually 

254
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,794
are,
but based on like our little sort of 

255
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,680
hippie version of life,
like,

256
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:19,514
look,
we could be like the banabos loving and 

257
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:25,730
sexual and affectionate,
or we can be like the warring horrible,

258
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:28,010
horrible chimpanzees.
Well,

259
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,570
you know,
it's also the case that,

260
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,404
uh,
how great does it feel to be sexual if 

261
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,130
you're being sexually out competed by 
others?

262
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:37,040
It's always unfunded to be,
you know,

263
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,083
low status and nature has different ways
of punishing and rewarding a status and 

264
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:45,410
achievement in,
in various,

265
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,750
uh,
the various different species.

266
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:48,584
So my guess is,
is that there is a kind of concise 

267
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,670
conserved,

268
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,743
um,

269
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,633
you know,
unpleasantness and losing each 

270
00:13:56,671 --> 00:14:00,150
particular game and a pleasure and 
winning each particular game.

271
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,303
And that's,
that's essentially how nature keeps 

272
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,380
moving forward.
Right?

273
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,550
Yeah.
Um,

274
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,810
you know,
to the extent that,

275
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,930
uh,
you're wasting energy.

276
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,670
I'm warring when you could be being 
constructive or being more strategic,

277
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,103
uh,
you're going to get out competed by 

278
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,810
whichever,
uh,

279
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,430
members,
uh,

280
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:21,690
of your species,
you know,

281
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,050
figure out the puzzle first.
And so I think that,

282
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,733
um,

283
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,500
you know,
there's this concept of the naturalistic

284
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,540
fallacy of,
of viewing that which,

285
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,171
uh,
you know,

286
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:37,120
if you assume that we carry some sort of
Judeo Christian baggage and all of this,

287
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:38,550
uh,
was thought to come from a,

288
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:43,590
a creator who was thought to have 
positive characteristics than,

289
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,883
well,
obviously the natural world is God's 

290
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:47,944
work.
But I mean if you actually look at the 

291
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:50,674
systems that fascinate me,
the creator would have to be about the 

292
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:54,884
most twisted consciousness.
A consciousness you could possibly 

293
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:58,424
imagine.

294
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,250
Well,
it seems like it's,

295
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,083
it's the long game.
The creators playing the creators not 

296
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:03,624
playing the game that favors the,
the health and the welfare of the 

297
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:07,660
individual.
And the current day.

298
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,763
It's the matter of like figuring out how
to get through this brutal game and 

299
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,033
advancing and evolving along the way to 
the point where some day in the future 

300
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,860
you find a more complex and evolving

301
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,100
system.
But this is

302
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,310
the most complex and evolved.
This us,

303
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,600
you and me,
humans,

304
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,920
most complex and evolved system in terms
of its ability to change its environment

305
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:34,560
that we've ever come across.
And we're not too happy with ourselves.

306
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,103
Yeah.
Although I do think that despite our 

307
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,353
barbarism,
we are that which can contemplate the 

308
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:42,644
game and you know,
at some point you've obviously had my 

309
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,414
brother on the street on the show.
I asked him as an evolutionary 

310
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:50,721
theorists,
Brett,

311
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:51,980
what are you doing?
You know,

312
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,200
you're married to one woman and you've 
had two kids,

313
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,390
uh,
as an evolutionary theorists,

314
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,710
don't you think you're throwing the 
game?

315
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,140
And his response was,
I think,

316
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,310
brilliant.
It was a.

317
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,630
and tell me,
Eric,

318
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,003
if you understood the game,
why would you want to continue to play 

319
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:09,530
it?
Right?

320
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,020
So for him it was almost like a sort of 
proof that,

321
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,010
um,
if you really get,

322
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,970
you know,
another one of his good quotes is that a

323
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,050
life when properly understood is a 
spelling bee that ends in genocide.

324
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,620
That we're also focused on our 
nucleotide sequences.

325
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Do you really care about the particular 
way in which you did digest lactose?

326
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,120
Uh,
different from how I do it that you want

327
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:38,954
to go to war with me.
So we can spell the future using your 

328
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,450
version rather than mine.
Maybe you,

329
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,850
you'd feel this way about your ideas,
about,

330
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,890
you know,
your songs,

331
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,390
your stories,
but really you really want to fight over

332
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,940
like things that neither of us care 
about.

333
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,980
Like what,
what are you saying?

334
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
Well,
if you're trying to think about like,

335
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,590
I want to leave seven children,
okay,

336
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,360
why do you want to do that?
Well,

337
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,520
because I want to see more copies of 
myself.

338
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:10,070
Well you will see a certain number of 
copies of yourself,

339
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:10,904
but that's going to get diluted very 
quickly by the time we get to your 

340
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,950
great,
great grandchildren's can be hard to see

341
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,784
yourself in your offspring.
So that's sort of an illusion of one 

342
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,470
generation,
two generations.

343
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,630
Most of the things that are going to 
determine your genes a propagating.

344
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,930
I'm have to do with the fact that you're
on a team.

345
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,990
There are a bunch of people who digest 
milk the way you do.

346
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,930
And so the key question is,
you know,

347
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,700
team Rogan on the milk digestion is some
huge number of people you've never met.

348
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,753
That's what I understand.
Like why I don't understand the 

349
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:43,454
connection to milk digestion.
It's just one thing that your body is 

350
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:49,070
doing in a particular way.
So,

351
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,913
you know,
like,

352
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,100
let's

353
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,920
take eichler maybe that's more familiar.
So,

354
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,560
you know,
I,

355
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,393
I know that I have a blue illegal that 
is being suppressed in terms of its 

356
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,380
expression.
Do I really care that um,

357
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,350
you know,
if my wife has two brown illegals,

358
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,813
um,
does it matter to me that my blue 

359
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:08,364
somehow survives?
Do I care that I want it to survive 

360
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,134
enough against some brown eyed person?
It'd be interesting if you had a 

361
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,480
checklist of like what things that you 
would agree upon,

362
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,220
like you and the wife get together,
say,

363
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,510
okay,
so,

364
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,110
uh,
this ability,

365
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,420
what do you think?
You know,

366
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,730
who's who side?
We go on with intelligence.

367
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,650
You're a little smarter than me.
I'm going to give it to you.

368
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,430
Let's go with.
Let's go with your brains.

369
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:31,021
Yeah.
Okay.

370
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,420
I'm better at smelling things like,
how do you.

371
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,333
I'm just allergic to cats.
Let's have none of the kids fucking 

372
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:37,950
sneeze.

373
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,830
Every time they go near a litter box was
the great thing was just flip a coin.

374
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,783
Yeah,
let's do it a couple of times and 

375
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,540
whatever we get we get.
I,

376
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,374
I worry about a crispr cas,
nine people are going to be having 

377
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,350
these,
like,

378
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:51,510
I'll trade you this for that.
We're gonna have crazy.

379
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah,
I'm fascinated by crispr.

380
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,400
I mean I think most people aren't even 
aware of it.

381
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,010
People like you of course are people who
are paying attention are,

382
00:18:59,011 --> 00:18:59,844
but I think to the general public has no
idea that crispr even exists and it's 

383
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,103
potentially world changing.
I mean you're literally looking at the 

384
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:10,350
tools that will eventually lead.
Much like,

385
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,770
you know,
Alexander Graham Bell's invention led to

386
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,310
you having the Internet in your pocket.
Right?

387
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,830
Slowly but surely.
I mean,

388
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,673
you,
you're looking at the tools that will 

389
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:20,664
one day lead to us engineering some 
completely new organism that you're 

390
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:26,460
going to call human beings.

391
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,783
Yeah.
I think that's going to be a long time 

392
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,533
off.
Alexander Graham Bell was a long time 

393
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,080
off and I think,
well,

394
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,920
I bet it's less time than that.
Okay.

395
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,930
When was that?
Was the 18 hundreds?

396
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,800
What are the odds?
Two thousand 17 to the late 18 hundreds.

397
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,053
You don't take 21 slash 17,
we're going to behave a fucking 

398
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,060
incredible hulks and thor's and women 
look like wonder woman.

399
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,073
There's not going to be a single troll 
like looking person left and the one 

400
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,480
that I think we're going to be able to 
do a lockdown.

401
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,593
Yeah,
I think we're going to be able to do a 

402
00:19:58,201 --> 00:19:59,034
lot more competent torics of swapping 
something in that's known to work and 

403
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:02,544
swapping something out.
But when we actually get to like 

404
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,070
authorship,
we were like,

405
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,850
okay,
I got this great idea for a human being.

406
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm going to start from scratch.

407
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,060
Uh,
there's a lot of optimism that,

408
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,680
um,
for which I am the pessimist,

409
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,350
you know,
uploading the mind to a computer.

410
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,780
Yeah.
You pet Kurzweil's ideas.

411
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,673
Yeah.
Well,

412
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,070
not in the sense that we're never going 
to get anywhere close,

413
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,180
but just 1:45.
That's what they're aiming for.

414
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,460
I mean,
I'm optimistic about certain things that

415
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,650
turned out to be a lot easier than we 
expected.

416
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,723
I think that a lot of things that are or
we thought were going to require 

417
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,850
artificial general intelligence are 
going to succumb to much simpler systems

418
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,740
and so you know,
you might've thought that,

419
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:48,280
for example,

420
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,380
if you played through the great chess 
games,

421
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,090
have a,
you know,

422
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:55,360
the 18 hundreds,
like morphe in Anderson and things,

423
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,613
you might say,
well that's just a uniquely human 

424
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,800
activity and then you find out,
no,

425
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,940
no computers can trounce humans at chess
because it's not.

426
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,793
It wasn't what you thought it was.
Maybe music will be the next thing to 

427
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:11,860
succumb because that's really highly 
regular,

428
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,150
but music is also intensely creative and
emotive,

429
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,750
right?
It,

430
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,260
it,
it,

431
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,740
it,
it sparks feeling in humans and,

432
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,740
and I don't think you could really,
I don't know.

433
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,574
I mean maybe you could,
but I don't think you really could 

434
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:26,674
figure out a way to engineer or have a 
computer engineer something that makes 

435
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:34,420
you feel like led Zepplin the immigrant 
song.

436
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,763
You know,
there's just like a bizarre feeling to 

437
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:42,130
someone's art that comes through when 
you listened to it and you're like,

438
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:43,750
oh,
this is a fucking great.

439
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,970
You know,
like where I don't,

440
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,863
I don't necessarily know you could do 
that with something that doesn't 

441
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:53,200
understand emotions or is using a 
replica of emotions.

442
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,550
Whereas chess,
you know,

443
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:55,384
you know,
a rook move this way upon can move that 

444
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:58,240
way.
Here's the rules.

445
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:00,760
This is how it starts.
This is what once you get here,

446
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:01,594
you're in check.
Like those things seem pretty 

447
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,780
straightforward.
You're dealing with squares.

448
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,700
It's very mathematic.
You know,

449
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,410
one person moves in,
another one moves.

450
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,453
Whereas like there's like this fluid 
nature to art literature and music and 

451
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,770
the other half of that I think I 
disagree.

452
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,670
Really?
Yeah.

453
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,504
I mean,
so I don't know why you chose the 

454
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:21,274
immigrant that that's why,
because I'm going to go to cryotherapy 

455
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:26,020
after this.
That's the domino's to do.

456
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,420
It's just a good song.
So if we,

457
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,830
if you'd taken,
if you'd,

458
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,980
if you'd taken a Roy orbison's pretty 
woman.

459
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,350
Okay.
Right.

460
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,253
So do you have the main riff from that 
song had like walking down the street 

461
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,300
due to come to America or that we're 
going after the um,

462
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,360
the riff is like,
dude,

463
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,890
dude did it.
Who Do do it?

464
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:56,301
It,
it,

465
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:57,440
it,
it did it right,

466
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,353
so if you start,
if you take a guitar string and you 

467
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,923
split it into four equal parts,
you put your finger over a one quarter 

468
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,040
of the string and then you start just 
plucking a string and hovering above the

469
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,930
string so you don't actually push it to 
the fret board.

470
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,273
Those notes occur naturally as the 
harmonics in the expansion of the 

471
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:24,270
vibrating string so that those notes 
were not really chosen by Roy orbison or

472
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,113
whoever wrote the song.
They were really chosen by like a four 

473
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:31,030
day series and it feels like it's a,
a rift.

474
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:31,864
But I discovered this when I was in 
Indonesia as I would start playing that 

475
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,600
and people would react and I felt like 
why that song?

476
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,763
What about more complex creative and 
sort of improvisational song like food 

477
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:46,010
who child from Hendrix.
So I don't know

478
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
about Voodoo child.
What I mean take take.

479
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,823
It changes up.
So if you look at the first couple of 

480
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,104
cords of red house,
there's like some seventh or diminished 

481
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,260
chord,
like he's arpeggiated Nana,

482
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:07,094
and then he moves it down a half step,
which has to do with this tritone 

483
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:14,810
substitution and the symmetry inside of 
the seventh chord.

484
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,200
So if I recall correctly,
you have a chord like C,

485
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:21,230
e,
g,

486
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:22,064
e,
b flat would be a c seven chord and the 

487
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,460
e and the b flat would form this thing 
called a triton.

488
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,840
And now if you went in the blues,
you,

489
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,980
there are three elements of the chord 
progression,

490
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:38,981
the dominant subdominant and the tonic.
If you go down a half step,

491
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,480
you effectively invert the third in the 
flat seventh.

492
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,360
Uh,
so if you go one half step below that,

493
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,340
it's the flat seventh and the third I 
think,

494
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,600
of the subdominant court.

495
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,600
So Hendrix is actually playing with math
in something as basic as.

496
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,063
Do you think he's aware of it or do you 
think he's doing it sort of just 

497
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,370
instinctual?
Well,

498
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,263
first of all,
when you're visited by an alien 

499
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:04,754
intelligence,
we went through cuddle fish and we now 

500
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,830
we've gotten into Jimi Hendrix,
so that's like,

501
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,373
these are the,
these are the best alien sightings we 

502
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:13,640
have.
It's very hard to speculate,

503
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:14,474
but I,
I,

504
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,553
I just look at everything I've been able
to understand about what he did and you 

505
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:21,554
know,
you're dealing with a supermind as well 

506
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:27,050
as an intuitive mastery,
mastery of the instrument,

507
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,153
complete understanding of the chords and
progressions and just the ability to 

508
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:33,650
improvise and to make it sound 
different.

509
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,490
Adding the Wah Wah pedal and all that 
distortion and all the shit that he used

510
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,550
and the fact that he imparts more into 
one note,

511
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,413
like,
I wouldn't even know how to notate mean 

512
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,150
what is even the instrument.

513
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,680
You didn't play the guitar.
He played the guitar amplification.

514
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,740
You signal processing system as a whole.
Yeah.

515
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,830
So there are these people who are just 
in some multidimensional space.

516
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,880
Another one of my favorites is a guy 
named Roy Buchanan,

517
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,923
who somehow these guys who understand 
harmonics gravitate to telecasters and 

518
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,040
um,
you know,

519
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:10,874
pull a song called Roy's blues and watch
him just go into the multiverse and 

520
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,940
start playing with things that you can't
even imagine are possible.

521
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,403
So I do think that there's a very close 
relationship between algorithms and 

522
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:31,661
emotion and I just did this one for an 
old tweet of mine where I wrote a python

523
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:34,484
program that actually runs from the 
tweets of the entire program is in the 

524
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:43,310
tweet and it's purpose is to generate 
the chord progression for Pachelbel's,

525
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,590
which is if you want people to cry at a 
wedding,

526
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,483
that's the chord progression to play.
And so the idea that it's actually an 

527
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:55,071
algorithm that breaks your heart,
it is very frightening.

528
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,443
Uh,
just

529
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,620
some insane noise in the background here
folks.

530
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:02,830
They're doing some shit to our roof.
These are the last days that were in the

531
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:03,664
studio by the way,
which is hilarious that it's sort of 

532
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:07,480
highlighting why we need to get the fuck
outta here.

533
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,110
But I don't know what they're doing to 
this.

534
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,960
I mean,
does he even ran anymore?

535
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,990
Why will they do with fixing the roof?
Put a fucking top up their assholes.

536
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,370
The guy even asked me right before the 
show,

537
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,300
he's like,
what time do you take?

538
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,210
I told him,
it's like,

539
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,113
oh,
well that's right about the time we're 

540
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,240
letting explosions right above your 
head.

541
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,420
Sorry for people listening to this.
Like,

542
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:29,254
what the fuck is that noise?
That's the noises banging around the 

543
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:33,600
roof pinned down by enemy fire.
Yeah.

544
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,630
Well,
I mean I think it's also me as a,

545
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,380
as a human,
I probably have some bias,

546
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,790
some stupid idea that creativity is 
impossible to recreate.

547
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:51,150
You know that whatever it leads to a 
person being able to make some beautiful

548
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,024
song or create some amazing book is 
impossible for some sort of a computer 

549
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:57,520
to figure that out on its own.

550
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,753
Well,
if you've.

551
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,003
I would go ahead and hang out in a 
modern recording studio and watch the 

552
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:08,410
move the beat around and mutated and 
change it.

553
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:12,190
Or if you think about like that moment 
where share said,

554
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,020
hey,
I don't think autotune should be used to

555
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:14,854
correct my voice in a sly way,
I'm going to use this as the instrument 

556
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:23,341
itself and suddenly this metallic voice 
I'm actually isn't,

557
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,820
becomes an anthem.
And you start,

558
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,630
you know,
Robo share is incredibly inspiring.

559
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,993
Do you remember a Peter Frampton,
he was one of the first guys to use it 

560
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:37,230
in a song.
Do you feel like I do.

561
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,050
So he used that thing with his mouth.
They had a tube in his mouth.

562
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,300
So he's really actually using his body 
to shape.

563
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,943
He's using the,
it's like this five dimensional lattice 

564
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,333
in your,
in your mouth to produce the 

565
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,800
international phonemic alphabet.
So your,

566
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,940
your nose could be on or off.
That's one degree of freedom.

567
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,740
You can have vocalization on or off 
vocalization,

568
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,810
meaning you can have.
You're like F,

569
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,190
F,
F as in Frank Versus v as in victory.

570
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,060
They're the same mouth,
right?

571
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,270
But right.
So you just vibrating your throat so you

572
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:19,271
can have no vocalization.
So is in the throat somewhere.

573
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,900
Frank,
you fucking boomer like s versus z would

574
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:28,400
be another pair.
Okay,

575
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,523
so the sound that you're making with 
your throat and then you have like your 

576
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:37,760
lips and one of three positions.
So that's a third degree of freedom than

577
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:42,190
your tongue can be in one of five 
positions and it can be fully elevated,

578
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,023
half elevated or not elevated at all.
So there's like five parameter family 

579
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,420
that generates what's called the 
international phonemic alphabet.

580
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,840
And um,
you know,

581
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:56,674
one of the cool things to think about is
how could you create an instrument that 

582
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,044
naturally allowed you phonemic 
productions that you're not just doing 

583
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:10,210
these simple ringing tones?
Well,

584
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:12,790
there's gotta be a way to just recreate 
it physically,

585
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:13,624
right?
That just make an artificial head and 

586
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,680
maybe we just made an artificial head 
with.

587
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:18,514
I mean,
it's not like we do something that's 

588
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:21,640
impossible to recreate with a robot.
Okay.

589
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,670
But like in terms of if you take the 
collection of all major instruments,

590
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,240
what comes closest to the human voice?
A lot of people think it's the,

591
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,340
uh,
Indian violin called the Sarangi.

592
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,570
Really?
Yeah.

593
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,200
You never check that out.
What's a Sarangi?

594
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,083
A Sarangi is like a.
can we use it to drown out the pounding 

595
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:44,440
on the roof?
We'd win a Sarangi yeah.

596
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,760
I've never even heard of it.
It sounds bad ass.

597
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,860
It's so.
It's a strange.

598
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Violin is a strange violence.
A lot of sympathetic strings and um,

599
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,660
you know,
because of you can power into a note.

600
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,140
You if you,
if I have a guitar and I pluck a string,

601
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:06,190
I'm just going to get decay unless I 
drive the sound right.

602
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:09,370
But if I do with my voice.
Oh look how cool that thing looks.

603
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,703
Yeah.

604
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,620
Wow.
Louder.

605
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,893
Wow.

606
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,190
Just trying to imagine like a lot of 
those are sympathetic strings.

607
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:25,650
So they ring when you hit the tone 
perfectly.

608
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,993
Whoa.

609
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,953
Let me see.
So if you've never gotten into north 

610
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:38,471
Indian classical music,
this is today's your lucky day.

611
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,800
This is really cool.
It's wild looking thing,

612
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,390
man.
It only has three strings.

613
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,430
Yeah.
My guess is,

614
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:47,264
I mean I don't recall,
but very often you will need to know 

615
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,480
what that one looks kind of old.
It looks beat up fucking amazing.

616
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,420
You felt amazing rum.
Know Ryan on this thing.

617
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:57,254
He was like the ultimate,
ultimate Badass and the Sarangi I'm 

618
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,780
learning,
so almost died out.

619
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,790
It almost died.
I think it was like,

620
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:11,400
it was used for guzzle singing and 
courtesans used to play it.

621
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,450
What's that guzzle singing guzzles like 
his type of,

622
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,343
uh,
of song that would be popular in what 

623
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:22,031
would now be Pakistan in northern India 
funded Drumna Ryan decided to check this

624
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:28,151
dude out.
Do you remember Zam fear?

625
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:33,770
Master of the pamphlet.
Have those late night ads.

626
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,740
Remember that?
That should have died off quicker.

627
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,683
I am that old.

628
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:38,960
That

629
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,960
pamphlet thing really never caught on.
This is way better than the pamphlets.

630
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,910
Do you think this guy has groupies?
I know he does.

631
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,860
Does he teach yoga too?
It seems like you would.

632
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,180
Um,
well,

633
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:58,740
so you see the drums on the left or 
right?

634
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,320
Yeah.
So that's

635
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,750
the tabla and the [inaudible] and that 
is the,

636
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,300
you know,
I think many people would consider north

637
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:10,810
Indian drumming to be the world's most 
advanced rhythmic system.

638
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,190
Really?
Yeah.

639
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,120
I mean,
even,

640
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,040
even more than Africa.
Um,

641
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,773
the speed of articulation,
it goes at the speed of speech and if 

642
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:20,194
you take the Hindi verb to speak bold,
they have the system that they call the 

643
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:29,611
bowls and to speak the bowls is to say 
what you would instruct your hands to do

644
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,773
if you were playing.

645
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,063
Wow.
Look at him.

646
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,780
I've heard sounds like this before for 
sure.

647
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,630
Like A,
I'm a fan of dollar mandate,

648
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,180
like dollar Mindy's music.
Okay.

649
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:44,014
Let's get some cool music and he has 
this kind of shit in the background a 

650
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:48,220
lot.
Do you know who he is?

651
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:49,690
Right?
I do not.

652
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,830
You don't know who dollar Mendez I 
should.

653
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,160
What is the song?
The big famous song?

654
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,860
A thing?
It's called Tunic tunic tune.

655
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,950
It's really a bad ass song.
It's a,

656
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,790
I really love music where I don't know 
what they're saying.

657
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,631
You know,
I,

658
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:09,010
I enjoy that because it's just like,
you just kinda get a feel for the song.

659
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:11,890
You have no idea what the actual words 
where they could be totally corny.

660
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,540
You know?
See if you can find some

661
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,470
thing like speaking the bowls for Tabla 
and you'll see these guys doing this

662
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,190
thing where they decorated the tree,
didn't know that.

663
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,753
You know what they do,
places that they create with their 

664
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:28,964
mouths,
everything that their fingers would do 

665
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,090
with their hands so they can act that 
song,

666
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,953
that song.
We were just playing what's totally cut 

667
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:40,931
off this business.
He's got a bad ass.

668
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:46,311
I have no idea what he's saying.
You guys hilarious music video too.

669
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,310
The music is like,
it's not bad ass.

670
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,354
It's him against him in this video,
but he arrested for like a white 

671
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,790
slavery.
Well that's good.

672
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,570
Yeah.
He got arrested.

673
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,531
Jesus.
What?

674
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:10,020
It was like sex trafficking or something
like that.

675
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,153
Some kind of slave trade,
sex slave trafficking or something like 

676
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:15,150
that.
He was a part of some,

677
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,673
I don't know,
maybe he just pissed off the wrong guy 

678
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:21,810
in India and I guess they'd fucking hit 
him with some bullshit charge.

679
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,250
You never know.
You know?

680
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,440
Weird countries like that.
They can get away with a lot of shit.

681
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,063
What does it brother just died?
I guess that's taking over the news on 

682
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:33,920
his name.
Anyway.

683
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,540
Sorry.
So,

684
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:36,890
um,
what does that do?

685
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,950
Those drums called again,

686
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,013
often just called tableau,
but tableau is the sort of soprano drum 

687
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,970
and then the,
the beyond,

688
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,040
I guess you play with sort of the heel 
of your hands.

689
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:50,620
You strike it and go,
Huh.

690
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,150
And I think the,
you know,

691
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:58,151
the world's best practitioner is this 
guy lives in marine county now,

692
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,213
soccer Hussein,
who's the child of America who was like 

693
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,563
the bad ass of his time and it's one of 
these things where I think you sort of 

694
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:12,660
have to be born almost into the family 
to have this passed down.

695
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,913
How do you know all this stuff?
This is something you've studied for a 

696
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:16,734
long time.
There is an amazing book by guy named 

697
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,584
Neil Surreal that I picked up in college
and I just opened it up and it went 

698
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,090
through an entire performance,
uh,

699
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,390
of Indian,
north Indian classical music.

700
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,290
And I was just,
you know,

701
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,790
my jaw was on the floor.

702
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,790
How has the entire form of classical 
music much closer to our jazz.

703
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,380
So much more impressive.
I mean,

704
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:47,100
visually to watch one of these drummers 
and one of these soloists,

705
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,803
the soloists,
we'll try to lose the drummer and the 

706
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,760
drummer's got these mirror neurons that 
can't be beat and he'll just like follow

707
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:56,470
him everywhere and so you're just,
you know,

708
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,251
some,
some,

709
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:01,530
a poor white kid in America saying,
nobody told me this existed.

710
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,543
Yeah,
it's weird how we just choose a certain 

711
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:06,804
series of instruments that represent 
rock and roll certain series of 

712
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:11,460
instruments that represent jazz.
You know,

713
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,653
it's really strange when you think of 
the wide range of musical instruments 

714
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:20,340
that exist all over the world that are 
just never utilized in modern music.

715
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,683
Yeah.
And I do think that we've become too 

716
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:25,524
complacent.
We should be like Ian Anderson with 

717
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Jethro Tull.
Why?

718
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,720
If you listen to the flute Solo and 
locomotive breath,

719
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,510
that'll get me going every God damn 
time.

720
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,950
And why didn't I take,
I didn't take it off.

721
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,240
Yeah.
Um,

722
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,020
you know,
uh,

723
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,853
the clarinet was lost to jazz,
used to be this incredibly dominant 

724
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,340
instrument and coming out of the Klezmer
tradition,

725
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,823
you know,
it rocked and then it sort of became 

726
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:55,590
this non thing.
And at some point I saw a guy named Tony

727
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,423
Scott who was like the last great 
clarinetist and jazz who went off to 

728
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,223
Japan to study zen for years and he came
back for a birthday concert and he blew 

729
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:07,590
dizzy Gillespie and Benny Carter off the
stage.

730
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,270
I was just thinking like,
oh,

731
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,253
I forgot.
Clarinet can be the kick kickass 

732
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:13,560
instrument.
Yeah.

733
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,050
Most people think of it as something 
you're forced to take in high school.

734
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,663
Yeah.
But fundamentally that's where like the 

735
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:22,860
youth,
the Ukulele has come back like crazy.

736
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,670
The UKULELE was a Mexican instrument 
that was introduced to Hawaii.

737
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:31,510
Right?
Isn't that what your gaze?

738
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,660
I think,
but it got an.

739
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,890
It's a,
a big thing

740
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,330
in Hawaii,
right?

741
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,223
Are they into the Ukulele?
I think it came over with cattle 

742
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:42,574
ranchers.
I think it was introduced to Hawaii by 

743
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:49,030
people who brought over like cowboys,
like if I remember,

744
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:51,970
I might be butchering the story.
So forgive me my Hawaiian friends.

745
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,073
But I think what it,
what it was was they had introduced 

746
00:38:56,411 --> 00:39:00,970
cattle at some point in the history of 
Hawaii and when they introduced cattle,

747
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,481
they're like,
hey,

748
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:02,314
uh,
how do you keep these fucking things 

749
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:05,140
from wandering all over the place?
So man,

750
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:07,540
we got to find some cowboys,
teach us how to do this shit.

751
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,613
And they got some,
it was either Mexican or South American 

752
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:15,181
cowboys to come over and show them how 
to wrangle these cows,

753
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:16,990
how to,
how to corral them,

754
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,490
how to,
how to take care of them.

755
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:22,810
And then when they did these cowboys 
came over and introduced the Ukulele,

756
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,310
which is really kind of uniquely 
Hawaiian in art in America.

757
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,840
When we think about it,
you know,

758
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,150
you hear like a sound of the Ukulele.
We,

759
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,183
we sort of think about it as well,
like my daughter's a musician and when 

760
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:38,820
we're in Hawaii I got her Ukulele.
Like she,

761
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,970
you,
she plays it.

762
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,550
We think about it.
It's like in a lot of people's eyes,

763
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,384
like a lot of like what we think of as 
classic Hawaiian Music is played with a 

764
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:47,410
Ukulele.
Really?

765
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,243
Yeah.
So I think I'm going to fuck up that 

766
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:53,500
history was I thought it was like a 
portrait.

767
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,130
I think it's Oakland Lily.
It's like jumping flee.

768
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,480
So it's on wine name on a Portuguese 
instrument.

769
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,440
What's that?
That's it.

770
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,273
Make a pdf says they attributed to a 
three Portuguese immigrants and the 18 

771
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,603
eighties that developed it from three 
other guitar lick instruments from 

772
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,960
Portugal.
Quality Cava keynote.

773
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,223
That's the origin of the Ukulele.
But how did it get to Hawaii as they 

774
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,380
were in Hawaii?
Oh,

775
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,390
they were in Hawaii.
Those guys were in Hawaii.

776
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,770
Oh.
So they brought it to a why the guys who

777
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:23,260
made it?
That's what wikipedia says.

778
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:24,500
So,
but it's not wikipedia.

779
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,334
I'll say Brian Collins,
my brother and I have some weird 

780
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:30,010
diseases that I don't really have.

781
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,223
Pt is awesome.
I just love the fact that he's led 

782
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,093
people just edit it.
Like anytime there's a podcast and 

783
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:38,374
something fucked up happens,
you go to the person's wikipedia page 

784
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:42,070
and they'll totally butcher it.
Well,

785
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:44,170
the amazing thing is is that it works at
all.

786
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,011
Yes.
That's it.

787
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,690
That is amazing.
It is amazing.

788
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,280
I never would have guessed that.
Yeah,

789
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:51,900
right.
Like some user edited thing that sort of

790
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:53,980
what,
what's amazing also because there's only

791
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:56,710
one snopes,
you know,

792
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,740
like there's only one like real well 
regarded fact checking website.

793
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:03,790
Like someone will say like,
Hey,

794
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,030
I want you to snopes that.
Right.

795
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,530
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't anymore.

796
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,310
I'm distressful.
You'd stressed about distrustful,

797
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,920
distrustful of snopes.
Why?

798
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:16,920
Why do you feel like they're left 
leaning or do you feel like they're just

799
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,650
not necessarily 100 percent honest or 
what do you think well,

800
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,653
or do you think the guide gets a lot of 
hookers and blow and not really pay 

801
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:26,860
attention.
Sometimes guys,

802
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,980
the history of it,
it's fucking hilarious guy.

803
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,010
He just shacks up with some escort and 
she becomes the main editor.

804
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,190
I'm going to have some more dmt before.
I think that a one.

805
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:42,404
I think that the ICU not needed to sort 
fact from fiction at the moment is 

806
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,580
enormous.
The amount of money you'd need would be.

807
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,493
Oh yeah,
right.

808
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,430
Fantastic.
Actually today with Hashtag fake news.

809
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,760
So I am,
um,

810
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,283
I'm sort of feeling like I'm witnessing 
the battle for whether any authority 

811
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,140
exists at all and the claim that you 
fact check has been synonymized with the

812
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:19,220
fact that you're truthful,
which is total nonsense.

813
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,833
In other words,
if I accurately represent three people 

814
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:25,130
who were in a,
in a scene and I,

815
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:30,250
and I leave out to others and somebody 
says that fact you know,

816
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:34,190
that that picture is fake.
I said,

817
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:34,430
no,
no,

818
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,190
no.
These three people really were there.

819
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,450
Yes,
but you filtered out those other things,

820
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,284
you know,
you can tell lies by leaving things out 

821
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,450
by insinuation.
Uh,

822
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:46,110
I have this whole riff on,
um,

823
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,180
what I,
uh,

824
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,303
frequently refer to as Russell 
conjugation that other people call it 

825
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:52,850
motive conjugation.
So,

826
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:53,684
you know,
the difference between fink versus 

827
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,850
whistle blower is how I usually 
introduce this.

828
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,823
You have,
these are technically synonyms in 

829
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:03,014
English,
but you cannot substitute one for the 

830
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:06,830
other.
Whistleblower don't.

831
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,483
Well with whistleblowers,
the only is usually one of the only 

832
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:11,743
positive ones.
Chelsea manning is a highly regarded 

833
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,620
rat,
can't.

834
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,160
It doesn't work because of the emotional
shading.

835
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,080
Like another thing is to get somebody 
proximate to something very disturbing.

836
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:24,914
So Ben Shapiro and I were in this 
article about how the alt right was 

837
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:30,224
outraged and we were like the two people
cited neither supposed to be outright 

838
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:36,510
you,
right?

839
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,070
Jesus Christ.
Alright thing is a weird thing to know.

840
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:43,040
It's a great game.
You have to appreciate what it is.

841
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:43,903
Okay?
So if you're trying to silence the very 

842
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:48,914
small number of people who are probably 
your guests [inaudible] I'm the right 

843
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:54,644
thing to do is to make sure that their 
proximate to lots of terrible stuff so 

844
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:01,910
that people who are too busy to sort 
things out so well,

845
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:02,783
you know,
I neither condemned nor condone because 

846
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:06,620
all you're trying to do is to muddle 
everything.

847
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,753
You need enough fear,
uncertainty and doubt in order to get 

848
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:11,054
the job done.
And so it doesn't matter that the 

849
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,250
article says,
you know,

850
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:19,251
in the banner headline outright enraged,
and then the two people you know,

851
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:24,281
listed are like Jews who opposed trump.
But because when,

852
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,640
when those articles are parsed,
um,

853
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,010
it shows up as while

854
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,930
you were in a bunch of articles about 
the outright.

855
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,340
Yeah.
Okay.

856
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,203
So I get it.
You're really not paying attention and 

857
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:39,684
uh,
the,

858
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,583
the point isn't to inform the reader.
The point is to tag that which you wish 

859
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:48,540
to neutralize.
And so it's working very well.

860
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,300
Do people in the alt right consider 
themselves outright,

861
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:55,920
um,
or did they use to when it's become sort

862
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:56,660
of a pejorative?
So,

863
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,890
so,
so let's go through the craziness here.

864
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,760
Assume that you are not a democrat.
I'm not a Democrat,

865
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:06,270
might translate to libertarian.
The more Republicans,

866
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,910
Republican translates to right of 
center,

867
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,290
right?
Of Center,

868
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,170
translates to right wing,
translates to far,

869
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:14,004
right,
translates to outright translates to 

870
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:19,230
white supremacist,
translates to Neo Nazi,

871
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,970
translates to Nazi,
right?

872
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:25,740
And so you have these very strange 
chains on the left were Republican,

873
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:27,830
keeps bleeding into Nazi,
right?

874
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,230
Because of this very weird thing.

875
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,670
It's like,
well,

876
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,360
you said,
you said you didn't vote Democrat.

877
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,610
So I.
Can I say that you're right wing.

878
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,660
I mean your far right,
right.

879
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,160
You're,
you're basically outright,

880
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,300
she's holy crap,
you just,

881
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,163
you know,
moved somebody who's a country club 

882
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:48,420
Republican into being a Capo,
a agent,

883
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,383
you know,
and does not necessarily mean white 

884
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:54,600
supremacists are the,
they conveniently glued those two things

885
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,790
together.
I think Richard Spencer,

886
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,740
um,
considers himself all right.

887
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:02,050
Well,
I think he coined outright so,

888
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,903
you know,
the ideas,

889
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,743
white supremacy with a human face and a 
human faces as opposed to wildland a 

890
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,340
goat.
No,

891
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,660
he was trying,
he was trying to change the,

892
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:13,983
it was trying to come up with a 
friendlier version of Nazi or a white 

893
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,950
supremacist Solaris.
Right?

894
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:24,110
And so at some level that was a 
disgusting intellectual master stroke,

895
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,630
but then alright,
became the play thing.

896
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,561
Um,
you know,

897
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:33,561
a lot of people who are tired of being 
told what to think and who to be started

898
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:35,214
blurring these distinctions.
So now you've got this frog and 

899
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:41,550
sometimes you put a hat on the frog,
sometimes it's the Nazi hat,

900
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,290
sometimes the trump hat.
Right?

901
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:45,330
And so the whole idea is like,
okay,

902
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,373
um,
for those of us who got used to those 

903
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:53,811
lines that we do not cross,
those were major transgressions to other

904
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:56,401
people.
They're like,

905
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:58,380
well why should there be a rule about a 
frog?

906
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,333
Right.
And so you have this crazy discussion 

907
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,560
where you have people with terrible 
insidious intent,

908
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:06,743
people who are just clowning around and 
everybody is mixed in in a way that 

909
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:11,730
nobody can sort out.
Right?

910
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,380
Like the frog.
That's Keck,

911
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,310
right?
Yeah.

912
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,143
I mean if you really pay attention and I
think there's been some sort of a study 

913
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,410
done on what percentage of the frog is 
actually used for,

914
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,600
you know,
Donald trump or racism or outright.

915
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,110
And what percentage of the frog is used 
just for goof.

916
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,900
It's the vast majority is like feels 
good man type things.

917
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,090
But like maybe seen,
I get sent to many Nazi frogs during the

918
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:38,590
election.
I've been sent a few,

919
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:39,843
right?
Like anybody could make one make a Nazi 

920
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,840
and people have made this mickey mouse.
But you know,

921
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,953
we didn't use to like there's still a 
lot of stigma around reproducing 

922
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:53,794
swastikas with the color scheme and the 
orientation of the Third Reich to have 

923
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:00,620
you seen that the gay folks,
for what?

924
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,473
For a very short period of time,
we're trying to co op the swastika and 

925
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:06,490
turned into a rainbow swastika.
Take it back.

926
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,413
Oh my gosh.
Well,

927
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,460
when you go to India,
right?

928
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,620
You have the swastikas,
you know,

929
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,560
pointing the other direction with dots 
in them.

930
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,020
And so if you come from an American 
context,

931
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:19,750
you're just fucking triggered all this 
place up here.

932
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,110
There's a place in Chatsworth,
I believe,

933
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,243
that is in a very,
very old Indian temple that has 

934
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:30,110
swastikas on it.
And there's a large sign but it's not.

935
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,000
It's reverse swastika is a large sign 
explaining,

936
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,601
you know,
hey,

937
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:38,410
this is an ancient Hindu symbol and 
we've had it for a long time and longer.

938
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,170
Right?
I mean,

939
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,740
my guess I haven't looked at the,
at the etymology,

940
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:46,030
but I would guess that swag comes from 
beautiful in Sanskrit or something.

941
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,630
And so,
you know,

942
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,483
the question about who does assemble 
belong to and when is an inexorable and 

943
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:57,260
when is it an extra bowl,
when is it a,

944
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,143
like that symmetry pattern.
I have no question that you might find 

945
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,750
that symmetry pattern in nature or you 
know,

946
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,800
in like ninth century Islamic art 
architecture or something.

947
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,131
Well,
you know,

948
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:11,230
the hexagon they found on top of 
Jupiter,

949
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,420
remember that the storm,
you know,

950
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,550
what,
if it was a swastika,

951
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,110
could you imagine instead of a hexagon,
there's a swastika on top of Jupiter.

952
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,320
Jesus Christ you think is really take at
Jupiter was a Saturday.

953
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,580
Was it Saturday?
Jupiter might've been saturn there,

954
00:49:28,581 --> 00:49:31,240
but there was some very bizarre pattern 
pattern.

955
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,590
That's a very strange.
Yeah.

956
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:33,790
But it.
And it's uniform.

957
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:36,670
I mean it's like pretty close to an 
actual hexagon.

958
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:40,880
I believe so yeah,
it,

959
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,533
it is very weird that we get so wrapped 
up in symbols and symbols are so huge 

960
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:47,524
for us.
But they are efficient compressions and 

961
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:51,480
information.
So you know,

962
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,670
and then you lose,
you know,

963
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:59,671
assemble like you can lose the name.
I'm like,

964
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,640
Dick,
nobody's calling a kid's Dick was gay,

965
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,290
right?
Get it used to be gay old time.

966
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,850
The flintstones,
they had a gay old time.

967
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,743
That was one of the last uses of gay in 
that my grandfather claimed that the 

968
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,970
emotion of gaiety was lost with the 
word.

969
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,700
He claimed that there was actually an 
emotion that went with it,

970
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,140
but no one actually experiences anymore.
Wow.

971
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:23,260
Um,
but how does he describe it?

972
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,340
That it was a sort of a careless 
frivolity

973
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,020
that had,
had a certain,

974
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:30,854
sort of a combination of like innocence 
tinge with a little bit of a mischief 

975
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,080
like sexual mischief really.
Anyway,

976
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,943
you know,
so we become aware of words that opened 

977
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:48,930
up new territory.
So like the concept of Synack,

978
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,393
uh,
in Thai and lots of people go through 

979
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:54,800
Thailand come back and they need the 
words and look,

980
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:59,030
which is the quality of fun that 
something has to have in order for it to

981
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:00,110
be worth doing.
Like,

982
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:03,680
did you pay your electrical bill?
Know why there was no snuck in it,

983
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,730
you know,
so that,

984
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,430
that was like,
that's a concept or Chutzpah,

985
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:11,700
you know,
coming from Yiddish or Turkish has Yakka

986
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,533
Mo's,
which is the trail of light left on the 

987
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:16,850
water by the moon.
Right?

988
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:20,120
And so once you have a word for Yakima 
was,

989
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,580
it's very hard not to use it even though
nobody in English speaking context knows

990
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:27,260
about it.
Just the way the word Selfie,

991
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,870
uh,
if you recall when that came in,

992
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:34,871
we'd seen all these weird pictures of 
like ladies and you know,

993
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,773
uh,
restrooms taking pictures of themselves 

994
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,450
in the mirror and you're like,
what the hell is that?

995
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,721
Somebody says,
oh,

996
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,040
that's a selfie.
And I was like,

997
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,020
got it.
Right.

998
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,640
And then suddenly that word was 
everywhere.

999
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:51,230
So once we get the symbolic compression 
that goes with a concept,

1000
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,730
we become pretty dangerous.
My wife has a friend and so stupid,

1001
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:58,100
she has no one a selfie means.
So she takes,

1002
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:00,830
she uses Hashtag selfie and somebody 
else takes the picture.

1003
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,550
Yeah.
The nature of her,

1004
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,500
she doesn't have a fucking camera in her
hand and she's standing there with their

1005
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:11,300
hands on her hips.
I would love to joke with you.

1006
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,080
I have definitely used that Hashtag 
selfie.

1007
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,760
I've thought Selfie when it's not a 
Selfie at all.

1008
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,213
Well,
I mean it was just her picture of 

1009
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:22,790
herself.
Maybe she set up the camera.

1010
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,050
Maybe I'm the Asshole,
right?

1011
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:25,310
Isn't it?
Is it a selfie?

1012
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:29,240
If you put a timer on a camera and he 
stepped back and will fuck me.

1013
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:32,360
I'm an asshole.
He's a talmudic questions of our right.

1014
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,150
I'm wrong.
Maybe she's got a.

1015
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,250
maybe if you just have a husband that's 
so dominant,

1016
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:39,660
just sit around and take pictures of you
so you can put them on instagram.

1017
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,381
I mean,
you,

1018
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:41,214
you basically programmed itself.
You have a program monkey that'll take 

1019
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:44,930
pictures.
It's extend itself.

1020
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,730
Exactly.
Yeah.

1021
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,564
If you,
uh,

1022
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:48,763
if you shoot a pheasant and you have a 
dog that will fetch that bird and bring 

1023
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:53,570
it back to you,
you still shot the bird a pheasant?

1024
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

1025
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,130
Do you know how they do that?
Yeah.

1026
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah.
You,

1027
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,550
you flushed the birds out with dogs,
the birds go up in the air,

1028
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,220
they shoot them out with a shotgun,
the birds hit the ground,

1029
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,780
the dog gets it and brings it back to 
you.

1030
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,210
But you shot it.
Yeah.

1031
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,183
Yeah.
That's why they only call them 

1032
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:11,090
retrievers and things.
Yes,

1033
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,740
exactly.
Exactly.

1034
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:14,780
Exactly.
But we're learning a lot of shit.

1035
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,610
Let's,
let's just go over all we covered.

1036
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,850
No,
no quiz,

1037
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:20,684
but we recovered why we're moving 
because there's a fucking earthquake 

1038
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,880
going on on the roof.
Um,

1039
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,150
Indian music,
a cephalopods sneaker males,

1040
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,010
sneaker sneaker males.
Yeah.

1041
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,440
I didn't know so many things I didn't 
know about.

1042
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:38,190
It's not like a common thing though,
like everybody kind of knows that's what

1043
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:40,270
a lot of male feminists are there.
Like,

1044
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:44,300
like sneaker males,
they like sliding in closer proximity to

1045
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:46,320
the females by,
you know,

1046
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:51,321
by trying to sort of as pals some ideals
that they think would be more attractive

1047
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:54,450
to the females because they don't find 
them in nature.

1048
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,453
Yeah.
And then the problem is that the 

1049
00:53:57,841 --> 00:53:58,674
ambulatory window comes along and 
suddenly there's a desire for something 

1050
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,430
completely different and they go out 
with some biker right?

1051
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,400
Immediately it was like,
what happened with that?

1052
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:06,300
It's like,
I don't know.

1053
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:08,880
It was strangely appealing.
Yeah,

1054
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,670
it's that fucking gene poll,
man,

1055
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,450
the Goddamn genetics they've got us put.

1056
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,360
It is really amazing how we're conscious
and we're,

1057
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,120
we're aware of all these issues that we 
deal with,

1058
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:21,954
but yet we're still,
we're still at the firm to a certain 

1059
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:29,170
extent at the whim of these genes,
of these,

1060
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,043
these poles that we have inside of us.
That's like the argument that people 

1061
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:38,481
always make for why some people find 
like subsistence living,

1062
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,444
like those shows in Alaska.
So oddly comforting you ever see those 

1063
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:46,950
shows is you're really close with the 
environment that brought you here.

1064
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:47,701
Yeah.
Like Alaska,

1065
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,730
the final frontier.
You see that show notes,

1066
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:50,603
folks just live up in there.
They're actually related to that woman 

1067
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:57,330
jewel.
Do you know that beautiful singer jewel?

1068
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,253
Remember some amazing voice and uh,
she is related to those folks that live 

1069
00:55:02,851 --> 00:55:07,350
in Alaska and they have this show where 
they live mean they live way the fuck up

1070
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:08,670
there with nobody around them.

1071
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,540
They are literally in just bumfuck 
nowhere,

1072
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:15,630
Alaska to do that.
But it's oddly comforting.

1073
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,120
I'd love those shows.
I don't know why I love those shows.

1074
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:23,330
What really do I think you might.
I could see you doing that,

1075
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,970
delivered like that.
Nah.

1076
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,030
Nah,
I'd like to do it in little bursts.

1077
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,770
Yeah.
I enjoy a movie theater,

1078
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:30,780
sir.
I like a highway.

1079
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:33,190
I like to drive cars.
I,

1080
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,070
uh,
I enjoy television.

1081
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:39,150
I like cooking in a home.
I liked doing that.

1082
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:39,984
I like sitting down with electricity.
I like all the trappings of 

1083
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:45,630
civilization,
but I do enjoy going to nature.

1084
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:49,080
I have no desire to be a trapper and 
fucking,

1085
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,910
you know,
flying around in a Bush plane,

1086
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:54,570
landing places and checking my steel 
traps for minx and stuff.

1087
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,560
Yeah.
Those are the folks.

1088
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,420
Is that her in there?
Obviously.

1089
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,840
Super Old picture of it.
Is she one of them?

1090
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:03,400
Is she the girl with the red sweater?
Yeah,

1091
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,250
probably I forget the name of the family
killed.

1092
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,140
Killed.
Sure.

1093
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,490
Yeah,
I think that is it.

1094
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,440
Yeah,
but I mean these fucking people,

1095
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:12,630
they make their own houses up there.
I like that.

1096
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,860
And somehow or another she escaped.
She probably lives in Venice now.

1097
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,120
Some shit.
My Arch Nemesis is this guy,

1098
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:23,560
Garrett Lee see lives in Maui.
Oh yeah.

1099
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,040
Why you guys?

1100
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,370
Arch Nemesis is you don't have one.
Uh,

1101
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,300
I don't think so.
You should totally get one.

1102
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,680
What are they good for you?
Well,

1103
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:30,514
first of all,
lots of billionaires for cotton to have 

1104
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,560
an arch nemesis.
You go to movies about arch nemeses.

1105
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:37,510
I don't know what the plural is,
but it's like,

1106
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,150
it's definitely one of these things 
almost nobody has.

1107
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,900
And your arch nemesis has to be somewhat
like you.

1108
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:43,743
So you know,
like there is tension that there should 

1109
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:47,420
only be one.
Oh yeah.

1110
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,040
See,
I'm not an,

1111
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,230
there should only be one guy.
I'm a tribal guy.

1112
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:51,723
I think you should gather up as many 
people that are like you and support 

1113
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:55,080
each other.
Well,

1114
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,940
you do end up supporting your economics 
that you keep each other going.

1115
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,650
Oh right.
And it's some sort of a way,

1116
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:00,484
right?
Yeah,

1117
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,740
yeah,
I mean definitely.

1118
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,990
We definitely need some sort of 
competition.

1119
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,580
I definitely believe that.
So my,

1120
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:11,610
my arch nemesis took me out into the 
jungles of northern Mali.

1121
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,980
Kill you.
I thought so really?

1122
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,770
We wonder if you have an enemy.
And he says,

1123
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:18,700
Hey man,
you want to go hiking?

1124
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,110
Like,
fuck bro.

1125
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,260
Well,
I was,

1126
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,930
I was down for it because I just 
thought,

1127
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:25,420
look,
I'm not sure that he's the one is coming

1128
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:26,110
back.
Right,

1129
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:26,870
right.
Yeah.

1130
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,380
Anyway,
we're on this trail and um,

1131
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,600
we're visiting this phd mathematician in
the jungles.

1132
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:39,100
It is without question the most mosquito
ridden place I've ever been.

1133
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,780
Yeah.
It's just,

1134
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,360
it's unlivable now.
He has some incredible rainforest.

1135
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,253
Incredible.
And we get out along this trail hike 

1136
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,180
like a mile or two in and this guy has 
built Shangrila.

1137
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,270
He's taken this river and he's,
you know,

1138
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,870
he's been there for like 25,
30,

1139
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:56,704
40 years and he's,
he's like a phd in differential 

1140
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:00,220
geometry.

1141
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,053
Wow.
He like lives into this amazing jury in 

1142
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,780
tree fruit Durian.
Is that.

1143
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:09,270
Yeah,
that's that stinky fruit.

1144
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:10,420
Right.
Why would he do that?

1145
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,973
Because if you've ever had great,
and it's one of the great pleasures of 

1146
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:15,660
life really?
Oh God.

1147
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,380
So it stinks,
but it tastes good.

1148
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,940
Yeah.
It's like limburger cheese.

1149
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,840
Oh,
okay.

1150
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,630
That's a good analysis.
So anyway,

1151
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:27,010
this guy has built this solitary world 
that nobody is watching,

1152
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:27,893
like it's a performance for one and it's
like this naturally sculpted wonderland 

1153
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,243
that he lives in with all these 
mosquitoes that he doesn't notice under 

1154
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:40,150
his diary entries where you can do 
mathematics.

1155
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,740
Why does he not notice him?
Has.

1156
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,550
Because you've been there for 30.
Yeah.

1157
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,750
Wow.
I mean you can't.

1158
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,610
You can't focus on that for 30 years.
He needs to get one of those.

1159
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:50,800
A thermo sells.
You ever seen those things?

1160
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,300
Oh,
they're amazing.

1161
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,613
Yeah.
If you go to anywhere where the 

1162
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,740
mosquitoes are particularly aggressive 
because like if you go to a Alaska,

1163
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,940
if you've been to Alaska before,
sir,

1164
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:07,110
one thing about Alaska that's fantastic 
is the mosquitoes are fucking rabid.

1165
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,553
They are like pit polls.
Me and my friend Ari went fishing in 

1166
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:14,580
Alaska and I am not exaggerating.
No,

1167
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,410
we didn't.
We,

1168
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,243
we spread ourselves up with fucking 
horrible chemicals that probably took a 

1169
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:21,470
year off my life,
but when you step out of the car,

1170
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:21,980
I

1171
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,510
mean when we opened up,
look at that,

1172
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:24,344
that's like legitimately what it's like.
We opened up the door to the car and 

1173
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:35,260
within three to five seconds there was 
100 mosquitoes inside the car.

1174
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,050
It's fucking insane because they're only
alive for like a month,

1175
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:39,884
right?
It's only warm enough for them to exist 

1176
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,520
for a short period of time,
so they're insanely aggressive.

1177
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,623
So anyway,
there's this product called thermacell 

1178
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,990
that outdoors people use and what it is 
is it's like a small pad that looks like

1179
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:51,824
a large square,
like piece of gum or something like 

1180
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,464
that,
and you slide this blue pad under this 

1181
00:59:57,021 --> 01:00:00,380
screen and then you ignite it by 
pressing a button.

1182
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:01,214
This little heating element goes off and
it has like a little fuel canister that 

1183
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,350
keeps this very tiny fire.
It's immensely small.

1184
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,960
You have to look into see if it's lit 
right.

1185
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,520
It's probably not even a fire.

1186
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,160
It's like somehow or another element is 
heating up this fuel.

1187
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,410
It takes a long time to go through a 
small canister,

1188
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:22,670
but it emits this very fine mist and 
this missed.

1189
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:23,504
We'll keep a like an 18 square foot,
get out window of protection from Ms 

1190
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,570
Dot.
Dude.

1191
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,433
It is impossible to be in the outdoors 
with it without it rather once you've 

1192
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:35,130
had it.
It's,

1193
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:35,670
I,
I,

1194
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,890
I've found out about it from a,
um,

1195
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,570
my friends in Alberta,
they,

1196
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:39,951
uh,
they were,

1197
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:40,784
the first turned me on about it.
They live in Alberta and the same thing 

1198
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:43,304
in Alberta that mosquitoes are super,
super aggressive because it's only warm 

1199
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:47,930
enough for them to exist for short 
period of time.

1200
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,210
I'm so glad I did the show.
Dude.

1201
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,760
Thermacell is amazing and you can strap 
them to your hip.

1202
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,400
You just put one on right there and you 
don't even smell it.

1203
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:58,250
And the mosquitoes don't want to have 
nothing to do with it.

1204
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,170
They just keep them.
They try some,

1205
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,350
like really aggressive ones.
Go,

1206
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,890
you motherfucker.
I'm gonna give up.

1207
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:04,910
I mean,
it's amazing.

1208
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,420
It makes a,
being in the woods incredibly bearable.

1209
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:11,240
Like a meet.
My daughters wanted to go camping in the

1210
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:13,440
back yard one night.
There was bugs out there and I said,

1211
01:01:13,441 --> 01:01:14,420
Oh,
I've got the solution now.

1212
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,480
When I got my thermacell,
let that sucker put it there.

1213
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,510
Everybody's a alcohol sleeping.
Just no problems at all.

1214
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,930
Bugs and civilians can purchase this.
Yeah,

1215
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,440
well it's not.
It's not toxic,

1216
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,190
but it's super easy to use.
That's it right there.

1217
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,240
Yeah,
so that.

1218
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:34,090
Thanks to that blue thing in the top.
That's a piece of the thermacell,

1219
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:34,963
the chewing gum looking stuff.
These slide under that screen and when 

1220
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:40,640
it gets used up,
that blue thing becomes all white.

1221
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,550
It's so easy to use mat.
Go to like,

1222
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:44,623
come check it.
Just to say that they have a large one 

1223
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:47,870
there that looks like a lamp.
See that one?

1224
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,570
That looks like a lamp up there.
Fucking dude.

1225
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,120
Those things are the shit.
I hate mosquitoes.

1226
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,130
Oh thermacell.
So way to go.

1227
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,460
I mean I don't look google the negative 
consequences.

1228
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,080
You see that?
See that one?

1229
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:00,943
He's got like pouches on the side of the
container and one pound she would have 

1230
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:07,880
like your little extra fuel canisters 
and the other side.

1231
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:10,910
You'd probably have some of those little
extra thermacell paths,

1232
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:13,490
but one little thing,
one of those little blue things last for

1233
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:14,324
like eight hours.
So I mean one of the great questions is 

1234
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:20,160
some of the most beautiful land,

1235
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,190
uh,
in a place like Maui is mosquito ridden.

1236
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,900
And so if some,
if that worked,

1237
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:28,770
could you change the land value?
You'd have to burn them all the time and

1238
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:29,604
I don't know if it's something you want 
to breathe in all the time and I just 

1239
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:32,514
don't,
I don't know enough about negative 

1240
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:37,800
consequences but I've used them a bunch 
of times and they've never even given me

1241
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:38,634
a headache or anything.
Find out if whatever's in thermacell is 

1242
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:45,510
like safe for long term exposure is 
you're not supposed to use in a confined

1243
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,580
space.
Oh,

1244
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:47,414
okay.
Because there is some sort of stuff 

1245
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,164
you're obviously breathing in for sure,
but permanent permit then than parent 

1246
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:55,590
within.
I don't know how come.

1247
01:02:55,591 --> 01:02:56,940
Nothing.
You know,

1248
01:02:56,941 --> 01:03:00,360
I've asked this before,
but when we were kids and you read comic

1249
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:01,680
books,
but like radiation,

1250
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,430
they always helped people turn people 
into fucking superheroes.

1251
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:08,400
Yeah.
You never hear that shit in real life.

1252
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,300
You have to get lucky and get some hobby
attic mutations.

1253
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:15,930
So you've got like straight arms coming 
out of your head and never does anything

1254
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:16,760
good.
No,

1255
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,190
no mutations in bugs.
They're really cool.

1256
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:20,510
Well,
yeah,

1257
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,343
and bugs that I mean in,
in human beings like I mean I guess or 

1258
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,200
the Chinese experimented with that 
probably.

1259
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:31,100
That was the thing about crispr that I 
was going to bring up earlier for sure.

1260
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,030
They're doing that right?
They're making humans.

1261
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:34,853
Yeah,
I mean that's the thing about like 

1262
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,833
having this ethical moral stance on the 
use of something like crisper to 

1263
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:45,870
genetically alter fetus that if you do 
that,

1264
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:47,100
you've really.
If,

1265
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,500
if you have an opposition to altering 
embryos,

1266
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,653
that's immoral.
It's not something we want to be a part 

1267
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:54,450
of.
Yeah,

1268
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:56,190
but that's the problem.
They already passed that.

1269
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,290
The Russians don't give a fuck about 
that.

1270
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,710
Did you see that movie?
I'm a ICARUS.

1271
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,000
No,
God damn.

1272
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:04,280
You have to see that movie,
right sir?

1273
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,473
Um,
I had Bryan Fogel on last week who is 

1274
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:11,910
the director and producer of this 
documentary on the doping,

1275
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,490
the Russian state sponsored doping 
program.

1276
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,270
Russians don't play dude.
They don't play.

1277
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:22,060
They had a state sponsored doping 
program that was kind of overseen by,

1278
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,120
by Putin,
like down the line,

1279
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:24,954
like there's a direct chain of command 
and the whole entire Russian team is so 

1280
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:29,970
cheap was on drugs.
All of them.

1281
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,440
The Guy who engineered the whole thing,
like the main scientist is in the United

1282
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,780
States now under protective custody in 
hiding.

1283
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,063
And Putin is trying to drag them back to
Russia by stealing the homes from his 

1284
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:45,240
family,
stealing his wives home,

1285
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:46,074
turned him into homeless people in some 
sort of a lure to get him to sacrifice 

1286
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:52,860
himself to come back for the health and 
safety of his family.

1287
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,103
Do you remember what happened when?
Sit down that it didn't work out so 

1288
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:58,890
good.
The cell phone video,

1289
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,460
that's when you know you fucked up cell 
phone.

1290
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,400
Video footage of your execution.
Oh,

1291
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,820
that's that.
Saddam's execution.

1292
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:09,270
But I think he learned his son and his 
son in laws back,

1293
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:10,951
like,
don't worry,

1294
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:13,100
it's all forgiven than the southern 
Illinois came back and then.

1295
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:14,490
Oh really?
It was the,

1296
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,330
it was pretty skilled in,
uh,

1297
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:17,891
in.
Oh,

1298
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:18,100
this

1299
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,890
was a different situation then I 
thought,

1300
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:20,221
no,
no,

1301
01:05:20,221 --> 01:05:20,390
no,
no.

1302
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:21,320
The self.
I mean,

1303
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,193
even though that was a very strange 
situation because he actually was the 

1304
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:25,924
only guy was like,
he had his shit together when he was 

1305
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,890
being executed.
He understood the game.

1306
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:31,880
He accepted the gap.
So I got it right.

1307
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,820
But also he's probably like,
Jesus Christ.

1308
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:35,650
How many people did I kill?
I got the,

1309
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:38,230
I think after you've killed like a few 
hundred thousand people,

1310
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:40,360
you probably like,
I probably deserve it.

1311
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:41,630
Yeah.
I'm,

1312
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:42,850
I'm,
well,

1313
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,690
I know you've ever seen a Christopher 
hitchens.

1314
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:51,010
I'm narrating the original bath party.
Um,

1315
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:54,490
don't know.
I don't know what to call it.

1316
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:55,983
Theatrical video where like half the 
bath party was called out as being 

1317
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:01,383
revealed traders.
And then the other half of the bath 

1318
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:03,634
party was giving,
given side arms with which to execute 

1319
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:06,424
them,
making them complicit in the founding 

1320
01:06:07,361 --> 01:06:07,990
murder.

1321
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,150
And there was all filmed,
oh,

1322
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:10,984
I'm aware of this,
but I didn't know that Christopher 

1323
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,450
hitchens narrated it.
Well,

1324
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:17,800
he did something where he,
he brought it to prominence,

1325
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:18,773
right?
I think I was aware of it with just 

1326
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:22,810
Arabic and I couldn't tell what was 
going on.

1327
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,210
And then he actually said,
okay,

1328
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:26,800
look,
you have to appreciate.

1329
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,273
Well,
this is a topic that I think would be 

1330
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:31,450
good to talk about.
I don't know that I've ever talked about

1331
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:32,284
it,
but message violence is the glue that 

1332
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:36,094
keeps a lot of societies together and we
don't study it or talk about violence 

1333
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:44,680
that is specifically constructed to be 
theatrical.

1334
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:49,270
I'm like public beheadings.
Yeah.

1335
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,513
Um,
that would be it kind of message 

1336
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,140
violence,
um,

1337
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,090
um,
or for example,

1338
01:06:58,091 --> 01:06:58,924
forcing families to pay for the 
ammunition with which their family 

1339
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:08,410
members were executed to make them 
complicit and emphasize their weakness.

1340
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:09,933
Um,
all of the stuff that the mind goes to 

1341
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,800
horror movies to explore,
uh,

1342
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:20,400
is often used structurally,
uh,

1343
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,540
particularly in the Middle East.
Um,

1344
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,320
so,
you know,

1345
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,060
Isis,
for example,

1346
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:25,923
the Jordanian pilot video,
which I find that many people haven't 

1347
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:30,364
seen,
the whole point of it was that the 

1348
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:36,730
pilots were raining down,
death into particular forms,

1349
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:37,564
rubble and fire when people in the 
ground and isis captured one of the 

1350
01:07:43,571 --> 01:07:44,404
Jordanian pilots and decided that they 
would theatrically execute him with a 

1351
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:51,600
version of exactly these two things,
um,

1352
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,103
that he was meeting out from the air.
And so the whole point of it was to 

1353
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,570
create the cinematic imagery,
um,

1354
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:02,583
to sear into people's mind what it meant
to oppose isis that isis was in fact 

1355
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:09,580
just in a sort of eye for an eye kind of
way.

1356
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,510
And,
um,

1357
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,250
you know,
my belief is,

1358
01:08:13,251 --> 01:08:15,340
is that we don't understand

1359
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:20,930
the role that message violence plays in 
part because we are now denying it.

1360
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,793
If you think about Vietnam,
we have all of these images that were 

1361
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:25,334
burned into all of our minds.
I'm with Pulitzer Prize winning 

1362
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:31,400
photographs.
But in the modern era,

1363
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:36,680
you don't have images like that from 
Iraq because there was a,

1364
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,030
there was a decision that we could not 
afford in some sense,

1365
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:42,403
to have the kind of opposition that we 
had to Vietnam when people suddenly 

1366
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:45,590
said,
wait,

1367
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,270
wait a minute,
you're doing what in my name.

1368
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,570
There's a,
there's an issue that has always puzzled

1369
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:54,830
me.
And this issue is people that lean left,

1370
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,930
people that consider themselves 
progressives have a very distinct,

1371
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,960
very obvious bias against criticizing 
Islam,

1372
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,553
criticizing Islamic terrorism,
criticizing a Islamic suppression of 

1373
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:13,240
women.
You know,

1374
01:09:13,241 --> 01:09:16,850
that these criticizing these cultures,
uh,

1375
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:21,230
under the guise of not wanting to 
promote Islamophobia and things on those

1376
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:21,680
lines.

1377
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,070
And I've always wondered how much of 
what that is,

1378
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,113
is a fear of reprisal,
of speaking out against them is 

1379
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:32,444
terrifying.
So what they do instead is embraced the 

1380
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,433
cultural differences that these people 
exhibit concentrate instead on the 

1381
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:46,070
positive aspects of their community.
And the good things about Muslim culture

1382
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:50,180
and Islamic culture and not really does 
not bring it up at all.

1383
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:51,014
Like you very rarely hear people on the 
left talk about how oppressive and 

1384
01:09:55,701 --> 01:10:00,080
horrific some of the conditions that 
women and homosexuals are forced to live

1385
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:00,821
in,
in,

1386
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,180
in,
in Muslim cultures.

1387
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:03,263
Right.
And I've always wondered if that's what 

1388
01:10:04,131 --> 01:10:04,964
that is.
Like there's a fee because no one in 

1389
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:11,480
modern day and no one ideology is more 
brutal in there reprisal.

1390
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:13,790
I mean they kill apostates,
right?

1391
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:15,830
They killed people who leave.
If you join,

1392
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:17,780
you can join.
No one's stopping them.

1393
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:18,140
They're all.

1394
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:23,140
The whole idea of spreading Islam is 
that you should be proselytizing.

1395
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,790
You should be getting people to join 
because it is the only truth is the only

1396
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,870
way to go.
But once you do join the urine like you,

1397
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:34,910
you're not allowed to leave.
First of all,

1398
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,030
let's actually do this one.
I think it's important,

1399
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:42,290
but they didn't start that.
We Jews started this so far as I know.

1400
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,920
So if you go.
No,

1401
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:44,151
no,
no,

1402
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:44,984
no.
We don't.

1403
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:46,190
We don't proselytize,
but the.

1404
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:48,170
Once you're in,
you're in a really?

1405
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,670
Yeah.
If you go to deuteronomy,

1406
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:53,030
I think it says something to the effect 
of if someone comes to you and says,

1407
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:53,864
Hey,
let's worship God's not known to the 

1408
01:10:54,891 --> 01:10:57,860
father's a set upon them with the stone 
before anyone else gets there,

1409
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:03,130
but are you supposed to do that to 
someone who is already converted to?

1410
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,700
If you're in,
if you're in,

1411
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,400
you're in and somebody says,
Hey,

1412
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:09,860
let's go worship other gods.
You're supposed to kill them,

1413
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:13,650
but what if that was so interesting?
Like,

1414
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:13,980
so it's

1415
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,010
an old idea.
It's an old idea and it's not an Islamic

1416
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,380
idea.
It's a Jewish idea in my opinion.

1417
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,080
Okay.
But it does exist today,

1418
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:23,063
primarily.
So I asked my rabbi about this and she 

1419
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,333
did.
She said,

1420
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,950
you have a female rabbi,
you progressive motherfucker,

1421
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,480
you will look at,
you know,

1422
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:31,314
I have.
I actually,

1423
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,610
I like it.
I'm proud of this.

1424
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:37,650
I have a rabbi who happens to be female 
born female or was it one of them?

1425
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,880
She's all woman.
All rabbi allegedly.

1426
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:46,881
They're all women.
Caitlyn Jenner's all incendiary topics.

1427
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:47,630
Do you want.
No,

1428
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,440
no,
no.

1429
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,600
Let's just turn everything up to 11.
Come on,

1430
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:52,530
man.
I'm a comedian,

1431
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:57,870
right?
Have a boss in three minutes.

1432
01:11:57,871 --> 01:11:59,070
I'm about to be a target.
Oh,

1433
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:02,070
okay.
You're a no targeting female rabbi.

1434
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,840
So her point was,
yeah.

1435
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:05,880
And we don't execute anybody.
Um,

1436
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,870
because in ineffective,
that portion of the code never runs.

1437
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:11,543
So the Jews have figured out how to have
bad code that is almost permanently 

1438
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,320
inoperative.
Hmm.

1439
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,653
If I could stop you there for a second.
One of the unique things about Jews is 

1440
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:24,924
that there are so many Jewish people 
that I know that it's still considered 

1441
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:30,900
themselves Jewish but are almost totally
atheist.

1442
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,490
Yeah.
Like my friend Ari,

1443
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:37,240
like he was doing this video recently 
where this podcast recently and was,

1444
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,193
we were doing this challenge where we 
can't drink or smoke pot or do anything 

1445
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:43,284
for a month and we have to do 15 hot 
yoga classes and he's going crazy and 

1446
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:46,914
screaming during his podcast.
I am a Jewish performer and I live in 

1447
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:51,780
New York City.
I'm supposed to be doing drugs.

1448
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,940
I was supposed to be drinking.
I liked drinking.

1449
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,260
Um,
but he's,

1450
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:57,990
he's the biggest atheist I've ever met 
in my life,

1451
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:59,123
or if not an atheist,
he certainly at the very least agnostic 

1452
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:04,720
at the very least.

1453
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,700
He's definitely not as someone who 
considers himself a religious person,

1454
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,520
but he was,
yeah,

1455
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,363
he wasn't.
He escaped the clause of it when he was 

1456
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:13,914
young.
But it's Jews many times think of 

1457
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:17,643
himself,
it's almost a tribe as much as it is a 

1458
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,280
religion.
Like if you,

1459
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:25,320
you sit down and corner.
Most Jews that I know about,

1460
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:28,110
like how much of the Talmud do you 
follow?

1461
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:28,944
How much?
How much of the Old Testament do you 

1462
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:31,460
think is legit?
How much of the,

1463
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,050
the,
these,

1464
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:35,620
these teachings do you think are 
imperative for everyday living is.

1465
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,010
It was the vast majority don't want to 
have they,

1466
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:42,810
they're not connected to any of it.
If you're following the Old Testament,

1467
01:13:42,811 --> 01:13:45,180
you wouldn't recognize him as a Jew.
Right?

1468
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,560
Right.
We have to kill the apostates.

1469
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,133
I used to live in an ultra Orthodox 
neighborhood in Jerusalem and at some 

1470
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,244
point I was writing on the Sabbath,
my final list for leaving and the kids 

1471
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,060
in the building next door started 
shouting in Hebrew.

1472
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,850
It is forbidden to write on the Sabbath,
kill him.

1473
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,073
Whoa.
And the parents had to kind of knock it 

1474
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:07,404
off like the ultra orthodox parents.
So they wanted to kill you because you 

1475
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,980
were writing because it was

1476
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,160
literally that,
that was,

1477
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,850
I was violated on a bunch of little 
monsters.

1478
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:21,210
Now moms are,
is the word you're looking bastards.

1479
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,230
Anyway.
Yeah.

1480
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,073
So Jews are big into observance,
but part of the relationship is you get 

1481
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:37,030
to question things that are much deeper 
level than in most religions.

1482
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,013
And you know,
I would say six or seven rabbis well 

1483
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,550
enough to ask the question about their 
belief structure.

1484
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,000
None of them believe in the character of
God from the Old Testament.

1485
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:51,100
So how do they sort of rationalized the 
whole thing?

1486
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:51,963
Well,
that's the whole point is you have 

1487
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:57,460
layers of abstraction and um,
you know,

1488
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:59,470
if you're really stupid,
for example,

1489
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:00,304
do you believe that the supreme court is
a nine black robed a super geniuses who 

1490
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:07,480
can channel the original intent of the 
founding fathers?

1491
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:08,800
I think they're wizards.
Yeah.

1492
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:09,820
Okay.
Just like wizard.

1493
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:12,150
Well then then that sounds it.
I mean,

1494
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:12,890
you,
you,

1495
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:13,723
you,
there's a grownup way of loving your 

1496
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:16,684
country and there's a childish way of 
loving your country and there's a 

1497
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:18,993
grownup way of believing in your 
religion and the childish childish one 

1498
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:22,841
is like,
yeah,

1499
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:23,674
it's all literally.
But what is the grown up way of 

1500
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:26,560
believing in a religion?

1501
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:29,480
Well,
I mean,

1502
01:15:29,481 --> 01:15:30,314
in part,
and it's got a lot of hidden 

1503
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,730
instructions.
It's,

1504
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:36,043
it's not resolved so that you have these
sort of dialectical tensions that a sea 

1505
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:42,680
of like ethical guidelines as opposed to
like,

1506
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,050
yeah,
that's not telling you exactly what,

1507
01:15:45,051 --> 01:15:47,600
down from on high and giant stone 
tablets,

1508
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,080
well,
you know,

1509
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:52,670
thou shalt not kill,
thou shalt not kill has to go up against

1510
01:15:52,671 --> 01:15:54,500
an admission to kill.
Right.

1511
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,290
And so these things are not resolved in 
there,

1512
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:04,250
but I'm trying to swim back upstream to 
your original point about Islam.

1513
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,693
We're going to get waylaid here.
Will you leave Israel or Jews 

1514
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,740
particularly?
There is an answer to this and I used to

1515
01:16:10,741 --> 01:16:11,670
know it,
but I forgot it.

1516
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,200
What is the reason why so many European 
Jews have won Nobel prizes?

1517
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:19,860
So many European Jews are insanely 
intelligent.

1518
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:22,890
Like what is the modern social justice 
answer?

1519
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:26,580
It's because we cheated physics.
Want you that answer?

1520
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:27,900
That's a joke.
That's a silly answer.

1521
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:28,230
No,
no,

1522
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,070
no,
no.

1523
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,890
They're fucking smart.
Like why?

1524
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:34,800
Why are so many insanely intelligent 
people?

1525
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:40,010
European Jews.
So you.

1526
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:43,330
Is it hard for you to answer being a 
Jew?

1527
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,250
Yeah.
A little bit.

1528
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,950
Like if you asked me about,
uh,

1529
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,461
well let,
let,

1530
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:49,540
let's do a different one.
Okay.

1531
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,220
Okay.
So from 18,

1532
01:16:51,221 --> 01:16:56,221
97 and 1987,
you had all of these different countries

1533
01:16:56,381 --> 01:16:57,214
winning the Boston marathon.
Then from 1987 to the president 

1534
01:17:01,361 --> 01:17:06,361
basically to Kenya and Ethiopia,
maybe a Korean guy wins it or something.

1535
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,010
Why is that?
Well,

1536
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,470
now you have this really uncomfortable 
thing which is,

1537
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,840
uh,
is it culture?

1538
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,360
Is it that those guys in east Africa 
just have heart?

1539
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,240
Is it because they really run to,
to school everyday?

1540
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:24,740
Twenty six miles.
People said that and then turns out they

1541
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:29,741
take the bus like everybody else.
So there can be a genetic predisposition

1542
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:35,660
in tradeoffs space.
There can be a cultural premium.

1543
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,033
So,
uh,

1544
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,620
when you have the top marriage 
prospects,

1545
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:43,760
do you marry them off to the,
to the richest or the smartest?

1546
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:49,750
So in Judaism there is some weird way in
which intellectual prestige proxies for,

1547
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,620
um,
material wealth.

1548
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,990
So if you have somebody who's insanely 
smart,

1549
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:57,853
not very rich,
it can be very prestigious to marry 

1550
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,273
your,
uh,

1551
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,400
your daughter,
let's say to that a student of the tour.

1552
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:10,720
So there are all sorts of cultural 
strange aspects of this.

1553
01:18:11,361 --> 01:18:12,194
Is it because money lending was 
prescribed and forbidden to Christians 

1554
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:20,690
that this particular facility with 
mathematics was highly selected for when

1555
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:22,160
nobody else was selecting for it?

1556
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,740
You know,
I don't know what the answer is,

1557
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:28,820
but I do know that I'm like,
in my case,

1558
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:32,540
getting a phd in mathematics using an 
Ivy league education for that,

1559
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,433
or in my brother's case,
giving up an ivy league education to 

1560
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:39,680
make a point.
I'm standing up for social justice.

1561
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:42,800
These are sort of self destructive 
things in most cultures.

1562
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,730
Standing up for social justice against 
social justice warriors.

1563
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:48,870
We,
in his case,

1564
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:50,443
he stood up because a Jewish fraternity 
was using black strippers for sexual 

1565
01:18:56,691 --> 01:19:01,070
entertainment to a lure in a incoming 
freshman.

1566
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,510
And he said,
okay,

1567
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,440
this is,
you know,

1568
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:07,590
this is some sort of class oriented 
thing where we're exploiting one.

1569
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,790
This is a different situation.
No,

1570
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:09,970
no,
no,

1571
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:10,521
no.
Yeah.

1572
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:12,350
So he had,
he had to leave Penn,

1573
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,330
university of Pennsylvania under death 
threats.

1574
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,640
Um,
wow.

1575
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:17,591
So,
you know,

1576
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:18,424
this is the great irony of my brother's 
situation is that for people who don't 

1577
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:23,470
know who your brother,
Bret Weinstein,

1578
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:23,600
yeah.

1579
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,470
Is a Weinstein.
Harvey Weinstein.

1580
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,040
Bret Weinstein,
right?

1581
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,223
I'm Brett,
was the guy that was the part of the 

1582
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:36,920
whole Evergreen college fiasco.
He's been on this podcast twice.

1583
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,280
I suggest if you're interested,
you could either google his name and get

1584
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:41,114
the story from a multitude of sources or
listen to the original podcast where he 

1585
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,213
sort of laid it out.
It was before the settlement with the 

1586
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:51,070
college before he wound up leaving and 
you know,

1587
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,780
I really hope that he goes the Jordan 
Peterson route,

1588
01:19:53,781 --> 01:19:58,670
meaning that he starts putting up these 
lectures and some of these ideas that he

1589
01:19:58,671 --> 01:20:03,590
has just putting them up on online.
It just putting videos up and patriot.

1590
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,810
I know he's got a patriot on page now,
correct?

1591
01:20:05,811 --> 01:20:06,590
Yep.
And that.

1592
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:08,160
Which is a great way to do it too.
But

1593
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,610
Jordan is making more money from doing 
that than he ever did.

1594
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,110
From College.
Yeah.

1595
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,330
For Teaching University.
I want to support.

1596
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:16,290
You know,
the other thing is,

1597
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:19,800
is that we have to make the case because
he can't because it'll look wrong.

1598
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:20,653
Right.
Hire this motherfucker that 

1599
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:23,340
motherfucker.
Yeah.

1600
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,200
I mean he's amazing.
He's a straight up genius.

1601
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:30,201
I have a recommendation for him from his
old advisor who I think he said he's the

1602
01:20:31,111 --> 01:20:31,944
top student in 40 years of advising and 
just we have to recognize that if you 

1603
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:38,334
want this stuff to stop,
you have to make it not pay to drive 

1604
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:42,384
super smart people who are courageous 
enough to be open in their thinking and 

1605
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:48,090
just shared.
I'm sorry.

1606
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:49,070
Keep going.
Yeah.

1607
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,393
Um,
and to share and to share their 

1608
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:54,330
thoughts.
And fundamentally,

1609
01:20:54,331 --> 01:20:57,630
if we drive these people to extinction,
it's on us.

1610
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,820
And so my question is,
hey,

1611
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:02,040
University of Chicago,
Harvard,

1612
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,030
Princeton,
Stanford,

1613
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:04,283
where are you?

1614
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:05,690
Yeah.
I mean,

1615
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:07,620
some people are terrified of 
repercussions,

1616
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,660
but they think that he's a.
he's a guy from evergreen state,

1617
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:16,040
so he's lower rank.
Let me,

1618
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,040
let me use my tiny megaphone to say he's
not lower rank.

1619
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:21,543
He's unfucking believably smart.
Look at his work on Elongate of 

1620
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,903
telomeres in laboratory animals where he
predicted what Nobel laureate Carol 

1621
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:34,800
Greider found from first principles that
the mice that are being used to test our

1622
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:38,190
drugs have wildly exaggerated telomere 
lengths.

1623
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:41,850
Giving them amazing capacities for 
histological repair,

1624
01:21:41,851 --> 01:21:45,150
but pop possibly putting drugs to market
that shouldn't be there.

1625
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:49,470
This is somebody you want to be taking 
intellectually serious and stop treating

1626
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:50,304
this like the clown act that they're 
running and this just happens to be a 

1627
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:55,350
victim.
Well,

1628
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:56,184
Evergreen college is an amazing example 
of what can go wrong if you let these 

1629
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:00,384
crazy children sort of dictate the way 
human beings are allowed to behave and 

1630
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,553
the way discourse takes place on campus 
to the cliff notes what I was going to 

1631
01:22:10,941 --> 01:22:13,350
say,
they wanted to have a day of absence.

1632
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:16,140
They've added traditionally had a day of
absence where people of color would take

1633
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:18,240
the day off to school for where people 
would miss them.

1634
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:20,690
Sort of like,
didn't they engineer that in La,

1635
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:22,740
David Without Mexicans who was a movie,
right?

1636
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:26,460
It would shut down.
We'll just tell you right now.

1637
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:30,020
LS shuts down without Mexicans,
but too,

1638
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:30,893
but instead of doing that,
the social justice warrior mentality 

1639
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:34,943
that thinks that every white man is some
sort of an oppressor and you need to 

1640
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,920
figure out a way to eradicate them from 
the world.

1641
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:46,340
They decided to go the opposite route 
and force white staff and white students

1642
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:47,214
to stay home.
Your brother rightly protested saying 

1643
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:53,440
that is inherently racist.
Like what you're proposing is is an anti

1644
01:22:53,441 --> 01:22:54,061
racist?
Yes,

1645
01:22:54,061 --> 01:22:54,894
he's anti.
The problem is that the diversity 

1646
01:22:56,461 --> 01:22:58,740
movement which has now become the equity
movement,

1647
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,350
is actually racist,
racist against white people.

1648
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:03,120
It's,
I mean,

1649
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,950
I don't even want to say it's reverse 
racism and racism against white.

1650
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
It's openly racist.
Reverse either racism or not racism.

1651
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:12,363
That whole proposal,
that racism against white people is 

1652
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:15,394
reverse race.
Now this is a cult and the way you know 

1653
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:18,724
that it's a cult is you ask for the 
definition of racism and if somebody 

1654
01:23:21,641 --> 01:23:26,641
tells you it's power plus prejudice and 
therefore certain groups can't be racist

1655
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:31,750
because they have no power.
That's how you know somebody in the cult

1656
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,030
because if you look it up in the 
dictionary,

1657
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:34,864
it doesn't say anything like that.
Another one would be a gender has 

1658
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:41,800
nothing to do with sex.
Go to the Oxford English dictionary.

1659
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:44,470
Look at the difference between three 
versus three.

1660
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:45,304
Be a gender and sex have been closely 
tied and sometime like in the 19 

1661
01:23:50,261 --> 01:23:51,094
forties,
a couple of fields in the US started 

1662
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:53,734
using gender to be behavior sex to be 
that which is your dedicated genotype 

1663
01:23:57,641 --> 01:23:58,474
phenotype.

1664
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,043
What what is going on is is that these 
people are changing the definition of 

1665
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:09,031
words in order to push a cult into the 
exact place where it must not go.

1666
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:13,990
It must not go in the diversity office.
It must not go in hr.

1667
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,783
You cannot have this openly racist,
openly sexist cult in the place where 

1668
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:24,640
the which is the immune system,
and so that's.

1669
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,503
That's.
That's the key thing is that we're used 

1670
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:29,980
to thinking of our immune system is 
being there to protect us,

1671
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:32,200
but if you think about an auto immune 
disease,

1672
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:33,813
it's when your immune system starts 
attacking the self that you're in real 

1673
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:39,220
trouble.
So learn the signs and learn the tells.

1674
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:41,770
You don't have to sign up for Jordan 
Peterson's postmodernism.

1675
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:46,420
Just ask somebody whether black people 
can be racist against whites and as soon

1676
01:24:46,421 --> 01:24:47,254
as you hear power plus prejudice,
you know you're talking to a cult 

1677
01:24:50,651 --> 01:24:51,310
member.

1678
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:54,910
As soon as you hear the gender and sex 
have nothing to do with each other,

1679
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,073
right?
And you have recourse to dictionaries 

1680
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,280
and you start talking about the history 
and somebody starts,

1681
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:01,840
well,
that's your white fragility.

1682
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,750
That's your white privilege.
Why are you in denial?

1683
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:09,751
Why aren't you accepting allyship?
So suddenly it's like,

1684
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:10,624
okay,
it's Xenu in the volcanoes and the 

1685
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:12,904
clams.
Again,

1686
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:13,940
it is.
Yeah,

1687
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,390
it is.
And um,

1688
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:16,393
well one,
one great piece of evidence about that 

1689
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:21,940
was this whole google memo thing,
that Google memo thing,

1690
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:22,833
the difference between what that guy 
actually wrote on the memo and what was 

1691
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,600
published in so many different 
publications.

1692
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:32,410
So many different online websites.
It's just straight up libelous like that

1693
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:33,244
guy,
if I mean I know he's going to sue 

1694
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:34,980
google,
but he's.

1695
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,813
He could probably sue a host of people 
once he's done with that because they 

1696
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:42,310
changed what he wrote and turned him 
into this horrible evil,

1697
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:43,144
sexist person to the point where the CEO
of Google have a youtube rather was 

1698
01:25:47,531 --> 01:25:48,260
saying that she.

1699
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:50,920
She read it and it made her sad at the 
whole thing,

1700
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:51,754
made her sad.
Well,

1701
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:52,983
he wrote up a piece based on why people 
of different genders are more inclined 

1702
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:01,070
to gravitate toward specific things.
You made an error how,

1703
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,190
what was the error?
The error that he made was,

1704
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:06,470
is that he used a reserved term 
neuroticism,

1705
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,513
the big five personality inventory where
it is a reserved term denoting a 

1706
01:26:10,861 --> 01:26:11,694
particular psychometric and so rather 
than saying men are less conscientious 

1707
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,870
than women,
women are more neurotic,

1708
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:19,783
women are more neurotic.
I actually brought that up with him and 

1709
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:22,064
he regretted it.
He regretted bringing that because I 

1710
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:24,524
told them.
I said that's my only criticism is like 

1711
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,430
that's a derogatory term,
but again,

1712
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:34,340
I'm not quite remembered that the big 
five personality inventory,

1713
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,080
you know,
his openness,

1714
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:37,700
conscientiousness,
extroversion,

1715
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:39,410
agreeableness,
and neuroticism.

1716
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,650
But you know,
when you see something that careful,

1717
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:44,000
I mean most people just didn't read it.

1718
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,833
They went with the headline.
So that's the first thing you should 

1719
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:52,010
guess somebody that's smart is probably 
using a term,

1720
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:54,920
if I say moral hazard to you and you 
don't know economics,

1721
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:55,880
you're going to think,
oh wow,

1722
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:56,714
what is the moral hazard?
Is that like reefer has nothing to do 

1723
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:00,250
with that.
It's a reserved term,

1724
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,123
right?
So if I keep talking about rent seeking 

1725
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:04,460
or moral hazard,
and I'm talking about landlords,

1726
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:05,903
you know,
or somebody offering your kid a Doobie 

1727
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,660
afterschool,
right,

1728
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:09,141
right,
right.

1729
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:09,974
So,
so that was like the first intellectual 

1730
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:12,091
failure.
I and I,

1731
01:27:12,091 --> 01:27:12,924
I just have been dealing with this with 
or I talk about power laws and 

1732
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:16,004
statistics,
which is a particular type of 

1733
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:18,590
probability distribution.
And somebody says,

1734
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:22,040
Geez,
the power powerful people in our country

1735
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:24,110
are so protected and privileged.
Why are we,

1736
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,640
why do we need laws to protect them?

1737
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,910
Like what?
Oh,

1738
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,243
you said power law.
It's like that has nothing to do with 

1739
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:32,633
the.
There used to be this character on 

1740
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:36,350
Saturday night live,
whose name was emily Latella,

1741
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:40,270
played by Gilda radner and they bring 
her in and she was hard of hearing.

1742
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,870
Say,
what's this?

1743
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:45,410
I hear about a death penalty.
The death have problems enough as it is,

1744
01:27:45,411 --> 01:27:48,380
and then she'd riff for two minutes and 
the death penalty.

1745
01:27:48,381 --> 01:27:48,771
It's like,
oh,

1746
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:50,240
that's entirely different.
Nevermind.

1747
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:53,990
So she was trying to remember like 
violins on television.

1748
01:27:53,991 --> 01:27:56,930
Can you read classical music?
Kitchen random was awesome.

1749
01:27:56,931 --> 01:27:57,890
She was awesome.
Zana,

1750
01:27:57,891 --> 01:27:59,510
Rosanna Danna.
Oh my God.

1751
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,070
You couldn't do any of this stuff 
anymore.

1752
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,200
You couldn't.
You really couldn't.

1753
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:06,490
But I'm getting back to the demore 
thing.

1754
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:10,070
I'm just checking our tree and it's 
exploding here.

1755
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:11,623
You know the thing about what he did was
he was trying to write a pro diversity 

1756
01:28:17,841 --> 01:28:18,170
memo.

1757
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:21,080
If you lie about the differences between
men and women,

1758
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,943
what are your odds that you will be able
to hack a solution to get getting all 

1759
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:26,414
the brilliant women?
In our country who care about stem into 

1760
01:28:29,511 --> 01:28:31,100
the workforce,
this is what we need to do.

1761
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:36,440
There's no shortage of brilliant women 
know I've collaborated with them.

1762
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:41,090
I know they're there.
We need to figure out as a society do we

1763
01:28:41,091 --> 01:28:41,924
need to pay women more so that we can 
get them out of working in the home and 

1764
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:50,060
taking care of older parents and young 
children during their prime years.

1765
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,013
We need to be very creative about the 
actual differences between men and 

1766
01:28:53,781 --> 01:28:54,614
women.
Should we have a rule not equal pay for 

1767
01:28:56,241 --> 01:28:57,074
equal work,
but equal pay for unequal salary 

1768
01:28:58,611 --> 01:29:01,770
negotiation if we don't allow ourselves,
but please,

1769
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,663
please elaborate on that because that is
an issue with why women sometimes make 

1770
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:09,360
less than men,
is that they don't have the same sort of

1771
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:13,380
aggressive salary negotiating tendencies
that a lot of men do.

1772
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:15,540
Aggressive testosterone driven,
sort of.

1773
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:17,280
I mean,
there's all sorts of things.

1774
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:17,941
You know,
again,

1775
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:21,260
I don't want to mansplain any.
That's not a big issue too.

1776
01:29:21,261 --> 01:29:22,930
I mean,
look at Chekhov.

1777
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:24,443
Short story called the Nincompoop in 
which an employer and a domestic worker 

1778
01:29:30,901 --> 01:29:31,734
in his home and he talks to her about 
all of her wages and then he starts 

1779
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:36,870
taking away little bit by little bit 
for,

1780
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:37,704
you know,
you broke a cup and you were a little 

1781
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:39,504
bit late and he whittles her 
compensation down to nothing and she 

1782
01:29:42,721 --> 01:29:45,600
accepts it.
And then he says,

1783
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,420
the employer says,
you,

1784
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:51,150
you stupid fool.
I've just cheated you out of your entire

1785
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:53,130
wages.
I'm going to give them to you,

1786
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:53,964
but understand that this is how an 
employer cheats and employee and you're 

1787
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:58,680
just like,
whoa.

1788
01:29:58,990 --> 01:29:59,823
So this is,
uh,

1789
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:00,773
an old Russian speaking a truth,
which is don't allow yourself to get 

1790
01:30:04,921 --> 01:30:05,970
taken advantage of.

1791
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:09,060
Now you could say that's really horrible
because it's called the Nincompoop,

1792
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:12,120
right?
Or You could say,

1793
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:16,260
actually that was an attempt to talk 
about a problem about needing to be more

1794
01:30:16,261 --> 01:30:21,261
aggressive and more assertive.
So getting back to the Demora issue,

1795
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:26,910
demore needed to set this thing up at 
Google differently.

1796
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:27,773
So I took my son to the local pinball 
arcade and just think of it as a bunch 

1797
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:35,840
of workstations where nobody's getting 
paid.

1798
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:36,683
Instead you're paying for the privilege 
of staring at this thing for hours with 

1799
01:30:40,111 --> 01:30:40,944
the bells and lights,
doing something with balls and 

1800
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:44,460
mechanical systems.
There are no.

1801
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:45,773
They're not a lot of women trying to 
integrate the pinball arcade because 

1802
01:30:50,251 --> 01:30:52,410
it's a loser activity.
Right?

1803
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:56,340
That's how they see us for losers.
I play pinball.

1804
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,660
I'm a loser.
I know these things.

1805
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:01,200
Okay.
Now my owns a pinball arcade,

1806
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,170
was kind of restaurant pinball and the 
second to hurt me.

1807
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,030
No,
I'm just joking.

1808
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,480
The point is this is something which has
low prestige.

1809
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,800
It's anti compensated and compensated.
Good.

1810
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:14,643
Could we appointing right?
It's just like you're just plugging the 

1811
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:21,870
money into the machines.
So my point is is that what you said was

1812
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:26,310
it's not cognitive ability.
You Idiots.

1813
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:30,240
It's interest in temperament,
which is hugely liberating,

1814
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:34,470
right?
If it's not basically cognitive ability.

1815
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:35,304
If men are as smart as women,
but men can do something for hours and 

1816
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,863
hours often uncompensated in a kind of 
robotic monomaniacal tunnel focus kind 

1817
01:31:43,651 --> 01:31:44,484
of a way.
Is that necessarily a great thing but 

1818
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:49,824
happens to be compensated now?
It's only a great thing if that's what 

1819
01:31:52,411 --> 01:31:54,370
you choose to go into for a career.
I don't.

1820
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,210
I program and I hate it.
I'm not programming.

1821
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,130
What do you want to do?
Play

1822
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,370
that funky Indian violent thing.
Exactly.

1823
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,320
But I'll spend hours doing something 
like that.

1824
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,930
Right,
but the point is is that coding turns me

1825
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:12,010
into like this autistic spectrum.
He guy.

1826
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,320
I get speech APP apnea.
Again,

1827
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:18,700
I don't want to say anything against.
The more you get into coding,

1828
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:19,534
you just sort of adopt a code mine,
so he started talking to me while I'm 

1829
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:23,670
coding.
Right.

1830
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:24,681
You say,
Hey Eric,

1831
01:32:24,681 --> 01:32:26,450
do you want to go out for a beer?
I'll start say

1832
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:30,490
maybe

1833
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,220
later.
Yeah.

1834
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:35,380
What I'm doing is I'm being annoying and
I'm distracting you from your.

1835
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:36,340
Exactly.
Right.

1836
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:38,020
Right.
I see you as annoying.

1837
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:38,860
Yes.
I'm.

1838
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:40,600
I'm trying to follow something as 
annoying too,

1839
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:42,300
if that helps.
Well,

1840
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:43,243
if it's,
if you're doing Brazilian Jujitsu and I 

1841
01:32:46,571 --> 01:32:47,700
come in and say,
hey joe,

1842
01:32:47,701 --> 01:32:50,150
you want to go out for a beer?
Like I got my hands full choked,

1843
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:50,701
bro.
Yeah,

1844
01:32:50,701 --> 01:32:52,640
yeah.
So you know,

1845
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:56,950
the.
The issue is that a lot of us,

1846
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,500
you know,
who have male hardware,

1847
01:32:59,501 --> 01:33:00,334
male software,
recognize that we get obsessive 

1848
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:05,170
compulsive.
We're not always thinking about reward.

1849
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:09,760
Right.
It's not necessarily the most attractive

1850
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:11,800
set of characteristics.
When I do math,

1851
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:15,010
I'm definitely wildly on the spectrum 
and I'm proud by the way,

1852
01:33:15,011 --> 01:33:15,844
I'm proud of it.
It's not like it's not a derogatory 

1853
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:19,174
term.
And you're actually talking about 

1854
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,150
yourself when I'm socializing.
Yes.

1855
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,190
I'd like to think that I'm fairly 
normal,

1856
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,540
normal,
fairly normal,

1857
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,500
but when I'm doing math,
yeah,

1858
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,100
I don't want to be right.
I want,

1859
01:33:29,150 --> 01:33:32,230
I want to kill that problem.
I want to think through that thing.

1860
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:36,700
I want to have that theorem.
I'm not on the spectrum in any way,

1861
01:33:36,701 --> 01:33:37,534
but I'm that way with writing for sure.
If I'm writing and someone came over to 

1862
01:33:39,671 --> 01:33:41,210
talk to me and be like,
ah,

1863
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:43,000
I can't talk,
you know,

1864
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:46,270
I'm in my own.
My wife will come over and she'll say,

1865
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,830
wow,
you're really sharp with me.

1866
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:48,843
Huh?
What?

1867
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,530
I barely even noticed that you were.
Oh,

1868
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:51,850
she's needy.
No,

1869
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,820
but the thing is,
is that we've collaborated on.

1870
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:58,893
She brought a geometry from quantum 
field theory into economics and so at 

1871
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:07,420
the level of,
you know,

1872
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,320
she,
she's really,

1873
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,183
she occupies brain space with me,
but she will kick out of that space if 

1874
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:14,500
the kids need something.

1875
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:16,480
Whereas I'll just say,
I'm sure the kids will be fine.

1876
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:18,110
Just,
you know,

1877
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,600
they're two years old,
Eric,

1878
01:34:19,601 --> 01:34:20,434
you know,
they're,

1879
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,840
they're not going to be able to take 
care of themselves,

1880
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:24,030
you know,
and,

1881
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:27,790
and so she'll have a much more.
She always has her compassion running.

1882
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,713
Whereas I can turn it off,
turn it on for periods of time when I'm 

1883
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:32,164
focused.
There are these differences and you 

1884
01:34:35,391 --> 01:34:38,170
know,
I think we need to impart to teach women

1885
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,170
how to under deliver under deliver.
Yeah.

1886
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,550
How so?
Well,

1887
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:47,551
if you can't risk underdelivering then 
you can't shoot for the,

1888
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,810
you know,
you can't swing for the fences as often.

1889
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:53,320
You want to make sure that you're going 
to be able to not disappoint.

1890
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,810
Some men very often like,
hey,

1891
01:34:55,811 --> 01:34:57,590
I thought I could do it.
Didn't quite work out.

1892
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,000
It's going to take another couple of 
weeks.

1893
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:02,090
That's a weird way of putting it though,
because that's a results oriented way of

1894
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:04,060
putting them instead of an ambition 
oriented.

1895
01:35:04,061 --> 01:35:07,790
This is what I'm trying to say.
Like if the real secret of life is over,

1896
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:11,390
promise over deliver,
I don't think it is though,

1897
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,720
some that it is assumed that you were in
a bid.

1898
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,390
If somebody else is going to promise 
more than you,

1899
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:21,830
and then if you can't overdeliver,
given that you've already over promised,

1900
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:22,993
then you can't actually delight people 
so that they're going to want to do 

1901
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,710
multiple,
uh,

1902
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,470
go rounds with economy of bullshit 
though.

1903
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,420
Like,
do we really want even promote that?

1904
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:36,290
Like why not just why,
why not?

1905
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:39,930
Just be honest about what you can do 
because you don't know what you can do.

1906
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:40,803
You know,
this is the thing that I will be honest 

1907
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:42,860
about what you think you can do.

1908
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:45,140
No,
no.

1909
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:46,761
Okay.
Well,

1910
01:35:46,761 --> 01:35:49,160
let's use it in a practical sense like 
so.

1911
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,490
So this was the whole Watson to bring 
you a car and I say,

1912
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:53,324
hey man,
I think the transmission's gone on his 

1913
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:55,754
fucking thing.
Do you not a fixed one of those things 

1914
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:57,980
and you're like,
definitely,

1915
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:59,150
I know how to do it.
I can do it.

1916
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:01,990
But meanwhile you don't write well I 
don't want to go to you man.

1917
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:02,943
Well I'll go to the guy down the street,
but you've given it to them for 25 

1918
01:36:05,181 --> 01:36:09,630
years.
He's given me the car right now.

1919
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,910
I go home.
I said,

1920
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,060
you know what I'm doing?
I'm trying to open this thing.

1921
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:15,310
I don't know,
right?

1922
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:17,770
I better learn transmissions fast.
Right?

1923
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:20,540
So now I go into crazy mode because now 
I'm terrified.

1924
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,970
This is called crossing the adaptive 
value.

1925
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,710
What if it's something you can't learn 
fast,

1926
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:25,820
like Brazilian Jujitsu?

1927
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:27,410
Look,
what if I come to you and I say,

1928
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,960
Hey,
are you a Jujitsu expert,

1929
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:31,370
Eric?
And you're like,

1930
01:36:31,371 --> 01:36:32,660
yes I am.
I'm like,

1931
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:33,494
okay,
cool.

1932
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:34,543
Why don't you meet me in two weeks and 
we're going to do Jujitsu and you have 

1933
01:36:37,461 --> 01:36:39,830
two weeks to go fucking crazy and learn 
all,

1934
01:36:39,831 --> 01:36:40,664
you know about Jujitsu.
So what we're talking about now is this 

1935
01:36:44,781 --> 01:36:49,190
is not a trivial skill and transmissions
is.

1936
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:52,370
No,
let's slow it down.

1937
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:53,323
Okay?
You have to be able to have a feel for 

1938
01:36:56,091 --> 01:36:59,180
what adaptive valleys you can cross.
Okay?

1939
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,520
I see what you're saying.
So in other words,

1940
01:37:01,521 --> 01:37:03,350
if you just say like,
Hey,

1941
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,780
I could run this country country,
uh,

1942
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:07,603
I run businesses,
then you're going to have a problem 

1943
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,280
because you really have to learn 
Washington in order to run it.

1944
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,440
Right?
And if you have no plan to do that,

1945
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:20,240
then you're just bullshitting your way 
through everything.

1946
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:21,470
Like hypothetically.
Yeah,

1947
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:26,830
like this hypothetical situation 
hypothetically now.

1948
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:29,413
But my point is that there are lots of 
things that don't have those 

1949
01:37:32,391 --> 01:37:37,391
characteristics were um,
something is really hard,

1950
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,920
but you may have to invent something in 
order to get out of it.

1951
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:40,880
So there's,
you know,

1952
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:44,900
dumb enough to get in smart enough to 
get out is kind of the magic formula.

1953
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:47,750
Hm.
Bite off more than you can chew,

1954
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,600
but if you actually,
you know,

1955
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:54,560
feel cold,
you can summon the will,

1956
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:56,790
you can summon the intellect,
you can summon your friends,

1957
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:59,570
your resources to somehow get across the
adaptive value,

1958
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,320
but isn't it a problem that it leaves 
open?

1959
01:38:01,321 --> 01:38:04,050
The possibility won't be able to get 
across that valley.

1960
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:04,933
We just put someone who is an expert in 
the field and who's worked very hard 

1961
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:11,370
through apprenticeship,
through schooling,

1962
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:12,204
whatever it is to get to become an 
expert in this field can tell you 

1963
01:38:14,341 --> 01:38:15,390
definitively,
yes,

1964
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:17,160
Eric,
I can fix your computer.

1965
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:18,023
I've fixed computers for a living.
I know exactly how to attach a 

1966
01:38:19,861 --> 01:38:20,694
motherboard to let's at least agree that
you're making the point that you know 

1967
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:29,180
don't over promise and under deliver.
Yes,

1968
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:32,220
but we all know that.
We all know that.

1969
01:38:32,221 --> 01:38:34,980
We all know that.
That's the general good advice.

1970
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,833
So,
but you're advising women to do 

1971
01:38:36,781 --> 01:38:38,910
something that they shouldn't.
But here's the problem.

1972
01:38:38,911 --> 01:38:39,744
I'm trying to give advice.
The more women that over promise and 

1973
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:45,390
under deliver,
the more people are going to go,

1974
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:47,700
you know,
what are these chicks?

1975
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:50,340
Because they don't deliver.
I don't think that that's right.

1976
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,170
You don't think.
I think that what's happening is,

1977
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,013
is that there are certain 
characteristics that are very valuable 

1978
01:38:57,691 --> 01:38:58,524
in low variance processes.
There are certain things that you want 

1979
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:03,270
every time to work out.
Okay.

1980
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,190
Right.
Well,

1981
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:06,373
child,
child rearing or particular kinds of 

1982
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:10,080
surgery.
Yes.

1983
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:12,640
Right.
It's a simple APP and a appendectomy.

1984
01:39:12,641 --> 01:39:14,070
I,
I don't want to get fancy,

1985
01:39:14,071 --> 01:39:16,980
just do the APP and an appendectomy and 
don't screw it up.

1986
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:17,780
Right.
Okay.

1987
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:20,160
Okay.
So those are low variance processes.

1988
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,343
Now you've got some sort of crazy 
conjoined twins that nobody's ever seen 

1989
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:25,854
before.

1990
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,000
Right.
And the question is what are we going to

1991
01:39:29,001 --> 01:39:29,960
do?
Right.

1992
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:31,453
Well,
do you think that that is potentially 

1993
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:34,693
within your ability,
even though nobody's ever successfully 

1994
01:39:36,651 --> 01:39:41,210
pulled it off before you have to over 
promise to some extent.

1995
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:43,700
Like there's a guy who's going to try to
do a head transplant,

1996
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:45,283
you know,
we,

1997
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:46,393
we had somebody who,
a head transplant with monkeys in the 

1998
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:49,730
early seventies,
Robert White or something.

1999
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:50,690
Yeah.
So,

2000
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:52,360
you know,
this came out of um,

2001
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:56,540
Jim Watson said this thing,
which I think is just brilliant,

2002
01:39:56,541 --> 01:39:58,640
which is if you're going to do something
amazing,

2003
01:39:58,850 --> 01:40:01,160
you are by definition unqualified to do 
it.

2004
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:03,410
That's Watson and Crick and Watson.
That's right.

2005
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,083
Now the point was is that those guys did
not know enough biochemistry to do the 

2006
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:09,343
Double Helix,
but why do you think that that's good 

2007
01:40:12,421 --> 01:40:14,640
advice to give to women to overprice 
over promise.

2008
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:15,990
I understand that,
okay.

2009
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:22,820
If you cannot over promise,
you may not be able to win a bidding war

2010
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:28,730
for the right to do a project.
If you're playing it very,

2011
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:33,620
very safe and other people are saying,
yeah,

2012
01:40:33,621 --> 01:40:38,140
I can get that done faster and cheaper.
See,

2013
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,360
the cynic in me says you're telling 
people to bullshit.

2014
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:43,943
I like Bill Gates.
I'd like to know whether or not someone 

2015
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:48,350
can actually deliver on what we're 
talking about.

2016
01:40:48,351 --> 01:40:51,210
When Bill Gates talked to IBM,
he didn't have an operating system.

2017
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:54,490
He said that he did.
That created a panic situation.

2018
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,003
How often do you have a product and you 
announced the date for the product 

2019
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:04,480
before the engineering is done,
but are you talking about outliers?

2020
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:05,493
Then you talking about people that 
pulled things off that you know the 

2021
01:41:08,201 --> 01:41:09,034
average person probably doesn't mean.
How many of you talked about the 

2022
01:41:10,781 --> 01:41:13,840
wayside.
How many people do over promise and this

2023
01:41:13,841 --> 01:41:17,080
is what I'm trying to get at,
which is if you value regularity,

2024
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,060
then under promise over deliver,
right?

2025
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:23,463
If you value shackleton like outliers,
you may have to over promise and over 

2026
01:41:28,151 --> 01:41:29,250
deliver.
So wait,

2027
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:29,680
wait,
wait.

2028
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,513
Okay.
Let's go ahead and you may have to risk 

2029
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:34,450
over promising and under delivering

2030
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,740
another thing.
Women are averse to that.

2031
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:38,603
Oh absolutely.
So women are averse to bullshitting 

2032
01:41:40,081 --> 01:41:41,860
people.
Absolutely they are.

2033
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:43,910
I like,
I'm not hiring chicks.

2034
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:47,010
I'm gonna start hiring chicks for the 
reason you're telling them to not be the

2035
01:41:47,011 --> 01:41:49,570
way they are,
but we're failing to communicate show.

2036
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,350
No,
no,

2037
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:50,751
no,
no.

2038
01:41:50,751 --> 01:41:51,584
I'm just.
I'm just playing devil's advocate and 

2039
01:41:52,651 --> 01:41:53,940
picking you apart a little bit.
That's okay.

2040
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:57,900
But I think in other words,
when when you start hearing people say,

2041
01:41:57,901 --> 01:42:02,901
why aren't there more female founders of
a billion dollar plus tech companies,

2042
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:06,953
my feeling is that a lot of those people
who do found such companies are in this 

2043
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:12,324
kind of fast and loose outlier idiom and
very often females specifically because 

2044
01:42:19,321 --> 01:42:24,321
of the crazy demands of child rearing,
which is something you cannot screw up.

2045
01:42:25,201 --> 01:42:28,230
You have to be on all the time.
You have to be incredibly regular,

2046
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:34,550
have a very strong ethic of not screwing
up branches positive.

2047
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,640
I don't want to say that it's negative,
right?

2048
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:37,474
I'm not saying that it's negative.
What I am saying is that if you are not 

2049
01:42:42,591 --> 01:42:45,530
happy because you were not represented 
in the outlier category,

2050
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:46,963
understand that not screwing up is not a
behavior pattern that leads to outlier 

2051
01:42:52,581 --> 01:42:54,230
level results.
I see what you're saying.

2052
01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:55,423
I see what you're saying.
So they almost have to go away from 

2053
01:42:57,291 --> 01:43:01,880
their natural instincts in adopt a 
different pattern or behavior to achieve

2054
01:43:01,881 --> 01:43:03,020
extraordinary success.
I mean,

2055
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:04,670
I would like to tell a lot more men,
hey,

2056
01:43:04,671 --> 01:43:07,580
you can't keep promising and failing to 
come through.

2057
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:09,653
So you know,
it would be better if we had higher 

2058
01:43:11,181 --> 01:43:12,014
regularity from some men who chronically
over promise and chronically under 

2059
01:43:15,561 --> 01:43:20,120
deliver and we had more women who were 
trying to swing for the fences.

2060
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:21,403
If the feeling is why are we not 
represented at the highest level of 

2061
01:43:25,611 --> 01:43:28,910
certain kinds of activities.
So all right,

2062
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:30,403
so what I'm trying to get at is,
is that we are not currently feeling 

2063
01:43:33,501 --> 01:43:38,501
safe enough to have these style of 
conversations where we're saying,

2064
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,273
look,
to what extent are we holding ourselves 

2065
01:43:42,141 --> 01:43:44,720
back?
Are we holding you back?

2066
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:46,183
What is it that we need to be doing?
Or are we talking about the glass floor 

2067
01:43:48,621 --> 01:43:51,980
as well as the glass ceiling.
So know the brick layer

2068
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,813
unions.
The is a famous example where if you 

2069
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,670
look for pictures of brick layers,
you'll generally see a bunch of guys,

2070
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:00,093
a very few women and there is no 
complaint that these have not been 

2071
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:03,134
integrated.
So there are ways in which you don't 

2072
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:06,194
find women in the pinball arcades,
you don't find them in brick layers 

2073
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:11,210
unions and you find fewer of them 
founding,

2074
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:14,240
you know,
multibillion dollar tech companies.

2075
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,840
So how do we feel about that?
I don't know.

2076
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:18,763
I mean,
the key question is if you want to see 

2077
01:44:20,571 --> 01:44:21,404
change,
you have to be risking having a real 

2078
01:44:23,271 --> 01:44:24,104
conversation about these things.
And what demore tried to do was to 

2079
01:44:27,501 --> 01:44:28,334
decouple intelligence from this problem 
and say it's much more temperament and 

2080
01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:34,154
interest.
And the person who made that point on 

2081
01:44:36,921 --> 01:44:37,754
Dave Rubin show a month before the 
Google memo leak was my wife and she 

2082
01:44:43,341 --> 01:44:45,500
didn't get attacked because she said,
look,

2083
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,300
you know,
I was in an incredibly,

2084
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:49,640
you know,
basically an all male environment.

2085
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:51,103
I wasn't happy because of the 
temperament and interest when it got 

2086
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,180
highly competitive.
Uh,

2087
01:44:56,181 --> 01:44:58,880
I didn't want to spend my energy and my 
time fighting.

2088
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:00,100
No,
she has,

2089
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:03,590
she has like a Nobel quality result in 
economics.

2090
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:08,710
And her feeling was it's just not worth 
it to get into some multi-decade pissing

2091
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:12,260
match with incredibly powerful people.
Now,

2092
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,140
my feeling about this is those guys are 
going down.

2093
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,130
We're gonna fight them.
You know,

2094
01:45:17,131 --> 01:45:17,964
I read my book,
came out called the physics of Wall 

2095
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:22,874
Street that I encourage women to read 
the chapter called a new Manhattan 

2096
01:45:28,101 --> 01:45:28,934
project.
And the epilogue discusses her 

2097
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:33,300
contribution,
uh,

2098
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:34,903
and you know,
in fact we sort of walked away from it 

2099
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:37,544
in part because she didn't want to go to
war and there's nothing wrong with not 

2100
01:45:41,271 --> 01:45:44,150
wanting to go to war,
but that is a very big,

2101
01:45:44,151 --> 01:45:47,600
temperamental difference that is not a 
cognitive difference.

2102
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:51,470
And that's what I think the more we're 
saying now,

2103
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:52,603
I think you and I would both agree that 
we would never want anyone to 

2104
01:45:56,121 --> 01:45:56,954
discriminate against women for a job 
they're qualified for and that they're 

2105
01:46:00,591 --> 01:46:02,660
looking to get into.
If they're good at it,

2106
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:07,520
we would like to see people who would 
like to see in a quality of opportunity.

2107
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:08,870
Right.
More than that.

2108
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:09,920
More than that.
Yeah.

2109
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:13,910
I mean if you think about how many women
are offline and you think of it as like,

2110
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:16,700
just stop thinking about in terms of 
social good.

2111
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:20,300
And think about it as like when you like
an oil field that hasn't been tapped,

2112
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:25,370
just their neuro field.
See what you're saying is essential.

2113
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,330
Yeah.
Right.

2114
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:28,320
Like,
you know,

2115
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:30,200
you're just talking about Jews and 
physics.

2116
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:34,100
So one quarter of one percent of the 
world's population of 1:25

2117
01:46:34,101 --> 01:46:36,270
percent of the Nobel prizes in physics 
or thereabout.

2118
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:37,163
Right?
Very few Asian females have Nobel 

2119
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:41,810
prizes.
If,

2120
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:44,040
if I were trying to figure out,
like with oilfields,

2121
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:47,930
I wouldn't go to Texas to try to find 
more oil because I'd figured pretty well

2122
01:46:47,931 --> 01:46:50,040
picked over.
I'd try find some other place.

2123
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:53,340
It's like I'm going to find great waves.
Not In Hawaii,

2124
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:55,200
but I'm going to go to the Arctic,
right?

2125
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:56,034
So let's say Asian females have a huge 
percentage of the world's neurons 

2126
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:03,690
basically untapped.
If you want to make tons of money,

2127
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:05,880
if you want to cure cancer,
if you want to do all these things,

2128
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:08,430
figured out how to bring those neurons 
fully online.

2129
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:11,460
So it's not just a question of nobody 
wants to keep them out.

2130
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:15,930
There's a huge prize to be won for 
figuring out the puzzle.

2131
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:16,923
Right?
But it has not been proved that gender 

2132
01:47:19,781 --> 01:47:22,930
and sex have a role in what people are 
attracted to,

2133
01:47:22,931 --> 01:47:23,764
are interested in.
So why should we assume that just 

2134
01:47:25,601 --> 01:47:29,440
because we have these systems,
whether they're economic systems,

2135
01:47:29,441 --> 01:47:30,250
whether it's,
um,

2136
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:31,083
you know,
starting a business or whether it's 

2137
01:47:32,831 --> 01:47:33,664
working in tech,
why should we assume that women would 

2138
01:47:36,821 --> 01:47:37,654
want to do that?
Why should we encourage them to do that 

2139
01:47:40,001 --> 01:47:40,834
if they're not interested in it and why 
do we put so much value in it just 

2140
01:47:43,601 --> 01:47:45,400
because it generates incredible amount 
of money.

2141
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:50,780
Do you think that maybe what we're 
looking at is natural patterns?

2142
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:54,940
There's natural patterns where,
I mean this is what demore argued,

2143
01:47:54,941 --> 01:47:58,300
that men gravitate towards certain 
things more often than women.

2144
01:47:58,450 --> 01:47:59,283
And that was one of the things that was 
so disturbing to me that was overlooked 

2145
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:02,254
about his memo.
He had a full page and a half dedicated 

2146
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:06,603
to trying to encourage and various ways 
to try to encourage women to get into 

2147
01:48:09,881 --> 01:48:10,714
tech.
Right?

2148
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:11,643
Nobody talked about that.
The other thing that they didn't do is 

2149
01:48:13,511 --> 01:48:15,580
no one,
not no one,

2150
01:48:15,581 --> 01:48:16,414
but many of the people that read 
published his work and took snippets of 

2151
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:21,580
it.
They didn't publish the citations or the

2152
01:48:21,581 --> 01:48:23,830
Bibliography,
which is like Reno.

2153
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:27,500
It's immoral,
but it's what it is,

2154
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,810
is back to your analogy.
Yeah,

2155
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:33,250
these people are in a cult and this was 
a challenge to,

2156
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,160
to the ideology of the cult,
so no,

2157
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:35,850
but

2158
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:36,683
look,
let's look at it from the felt 

2159
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:42,180
experience in the felt experience is if 
you're,

2160
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:47,720
if you've already struggled as a woman 
against incredible odds to be in tech to

2161
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:49,584
begin with,
you know that there's somebody 

2162
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,300
whispering.
Yeah,

2163
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:55,134
she's not very good.
They only hired her because she was 

2164
01:48:56,611 --> 01:48:58,640
female and you're sick of this shit.
Right?

2165
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:02,880
So you have to appreciate that.
The lived experience of the women inside

2166
01:49:02,881 --> 01:49:06,240
of Google is that they know that some 
percentage of those guys were saying,

2167
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,283
Hey,
I just want to talk about studies are 

2168
01:49:08,971 --> 01:49:10,760
actually pissed off.
Right?

2169
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:15,270
So their bullshit detectors are set 
very,

2170
01:49:15,271 --> 01:49:16,104
very high.
They think they're hearing dog whistles 

2171
01:49:18,631 --> 01:49:19,464
everywhere.
Right?

2172
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:24,680
And so I don't think we should be 
blaming women who have been subjected to

2173
01:49:25,081 --> 01:49:28,680
this as if this is not a real thing.
There really are dog whistles.

2174
01:49:28,681 --> 01:49:29,514
There really are people who don't want 
women in tech and want to go back to an 

2175
01:49:33,211 --> 01:49:34,210
all boys club,
blah,

2176
01:49:34,211 --> 01:49:35,070
Blah Blah for sure.

2177
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:37,130
But that's not really what we're saying.
No,

2178
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:38,510
we aren't,
I don't think.

2179
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:39,873
No,
but the issue is what if I need to do 

2180
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:46,720
some amount,
some relatively minimal amount of um,

2181
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:47,943
kind of intellectual terraforming to get
all of these female neurons to work on 

2182
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,540
all of these amazing problems.
So what if,

2183
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:56,433
what if the people who have the answer 
for let's say cancer or Agi or who 

2184
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:02,240
knows,
happened to be female [inaudible],

2185
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:04,763
what if I needed to do some things in 
order to make the environment more 

2186
01:50:08,111 --> 01:50:09,760
attract?
Like for example,

2187
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:13,480
programming in teams has to some extent 
per replaced.

2188
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:18,030
Cowboy programming was just some guy 
with his code and you know,

2189
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,160
a set of headphones and he,
he goes to it.

2190
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:24,430
Okay.
So that's what he was talking about.

2191
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:25,264
Like what are the,
to what extent can you actually change 

2192
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:29,374
the nature of work to bring these extra 
neurons online now that's the right 

2193
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:35,230
reason to do this.

2194
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:38,740
I don't think we should value like what 
is coding?

2195
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:39,723
It's some sort of highly logical,
very technical persnickety activity if 

2196
01:50:44,411 --> 01:50:46,790
it's highly compensated,
everybody wants in.

2197
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:47,643
If it's poorly compensated,
only people who are sort of addicted to 

2198
01:50:50,531 --> 01:50:51,570
it would want it.
Right.

2199
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:55,690
And it happens to be sort of high status
at the moment.

2200
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:56,583
And so there's this feeling of,
okay this must be an all boys club and 

2201
01:50:59,231 --> 01:51:02,950
maybe it grew up as an all boys club and
maybe it has particular attributes,

2202
01:51:02,951 --> 01:51:05,830
but the thing that I,
I'm looking at maybe different from what

2203
01:51:05,831 --> 01:51:06,664
you're looking at is that I'm thinking 
about particular high ability females 

2204
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,573
who have left the game or who have sort 
of gone into a lower intensity mode 

2205
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:20,740
because there's just sick of being in an
all male environment.

2206
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:23,140
So if I can interject,
you try and discourage attrition.

2207
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:25,443
I'm trying to discourage attrition of 
the amazing people who have something 

2208
01:51:28,991 --> 01:51:30,760
deep and powerful and important to say.

2209
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:31,593
So the environment of these places is 
contrary to them establishing whatever 

2210
01:51:36,071 --> 01:51:37,440
strengths.
So let me give.

2211
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,153
I would rather not talk about women and 
I'd rather talk about something I know 

2212
01:51:41,891 --> 01:51:42,760
very,
very well,

2213
01:51:42,761 --> 01:51:43,970
which is myself.
Okay.

2214
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:48,820
So four and a half years ago I gave some
talks on physics,

2215
01:51:48,970 --> 01:51:49,803
um,
which were terrifying to me because I 

2216
01:51:51,521 --> 01:51:52,354
wasn't trained as a physicist and they 
got a lot of attention and publicity at 

2217
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:55,504
Oxford.
I don't like the unpleasantness of 

2218
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:05,100
intellectual oneupsmanship and negging,
if you will,

2219
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:08,740
that takes place in particle theory.
It's a turn off to me.

2220
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:09,813
And so I've sort of stayed away for four
and a half years because I didn't like 

2221
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:18,900
how unpleasant and hyper like 
exaggeratedly masculine it was.

2222
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,420
Why do you think that exists?
Well,

2223
01:52:22,421 --> 01:52:23,920
because it's a huge prize,
right?

2224
01:52:23,921 --> 01:52:25,540
I mean,
if you're trying to get,

2225
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:28,220
gain Einstein's mantle,
um,

2226
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,490
it's still a game worth winning because,
you know,

2227
01:52:30,491 --> 01:52:31,324
Einstein was times out of the century.
So it's still because of this huge 

2228
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:35,164
prize,
there's also a lot of critical thinking 

2229
01:52:36,521 --> 01:52:37,880
and a lot of criticizing.
Yeah.

2230
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:41,090
But there's a lot of just wasted.
Yeah.

2231
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:43,870
There's like a Dick measuring contest 
that does nothing for me.

2232
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:45,650
Hmm.
Okay.

2233
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:45,980
Right.
And

2234
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,000
so,
so my point is,

2235
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:50,150
is that is a guy who's been in 
mathematics,

2236
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:52,460
physics,
economics,

2237
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:54,110
finance,
and tech.

2238
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:58,280
That's five hyper male fields.
There are some of them that I just can't

2239
01:52:58,281 --> 01:52:59,114
stand because there two exaggeratedly 
male and you feel like criticism is 

2240
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:05,900
exaggeratedly male,
not just criticism,

2241
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:08,120
it's just like snarky,
stupid,

2242
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:13,430
mean spirited,
nonconstructive main girl show,

2243
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:17,090
female show,
maybe housewives of Beverly Hills.

2244
01:53:17,150 --> 01:53:18,920
That's pretty pretty.
Take downy.

2245
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,530
Yeah.
That's a different version.

2246
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:23,263
So um,
this is made you avoid these particular 

2247
01:53:26,511 --> 01:53:27,344
person makes lots of us men and women 
there would be more likely to avoid and 

2248
01:53:31,581 --> 01:53:35,030
you would lose the contribution trying 
to sell a lot of these brilliant minds.

2249
01:53:35,031 --> 01:53:39,050
That part of the problem is,
is that every time you have an extremely

2250
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:44,390
kind of overly like an exaggeratedly 
toxic culture,

2251
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:46,993
you get attrition from people who are 
really good at it or just don't like to 

2252
01:53:50,151 --> 01:53:50,990
go into work.

2253
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,380
It makes sense.
And putting that on women is not fair.

2254
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,053
Right?
I don't want to do labor economics at 

2255
01:53:57,201 --> 01:54:00,680
Harvard for the same reason.
It's a really unpleasant.

2256
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,830
I understand that once they've actually 
gotten to the game,

2257
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:05,533
but is that what keeps them from 
pursuing the game or is it natural 

2258
01:54:09,531 --> 01:54:12,380
inclinations towards other pursuits?
I believe it's a mixture.

2259
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:13,940
It's a mixture.
Most things,

2260
01:54:13,941 --> 01:54:14,810
right?
Well this is,

2261
01:54:14,830 --> 01:54:16,820
this is really what,
what Demora was saying.

2262
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:20,630
He was saying there's a 50 slash 50 
default baseline that you've adopted.

2263
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:23,770
I don't think I.
Ju,

2264
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:26,750
I James Damore don't think that we 
should accept 50 slash 50.

2265
01:54:26,751 --> 01:54:31,110
We should figure out what percentage of 
this has to do with um,

2266
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,050
interest and inclination.
Um,

2267
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:37,123
and that should be an adjustment and 
that we're sending tests do with 

2268
01:54:39,321 --> 01:54:40,350
prejudice and.
Right.

2269
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,960
So break it into two components were off
of 50 per,

2270
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:46,610
it's a plus b,
where a is the natural amount that it,

2271
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:49,400
it should favor one gender or sex over 
the other.

2272
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:53,360
And then b is the extent of systematic 
bias.

2273
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:55,320
That's a very analytical and I think a 
very.

2274
01:54:55,321 --> 01:54:57,810
I think it's exactly what he was saying 
is exactly right.

2275
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:00,410
You're one of the very few people that 
has broken down like that.

2276
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:03,080
It became this weird ideological 
struggle,

2277
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:07,700
but I got into tremendous trouble 
because I let off a tweet that was about

2278
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:09,050
biologists,
right?

2279
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:12,770
Because Richard Dawkins had just been 
deep platformed at Berkeley where he was

2280
01:55:12,771 --> 01:55:15,080
going to speak as a biologist.
My brother.

2281
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:16,010
Yeah.
What was that about?

2282
01:55:16,011 --> 01:55:19,550
Why did they do platform?
Because you know,

2283
01:55:19,551 --> 01:55:21,500
he said something on charitable about 
Islam,

2284
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,260
which means we have to get back to.
Right.

2285
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:24,613
But the key point was is that I had 
three biologists to more Dawkins and 

2286
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:32,480
Weinstein who had all been d platform,
so I let off a tweet about,

2287
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:34,760
you know,
for God's sake,

2288
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:37,400
stop teaching people that they should 
run to hr,

2289
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:39,800
um,
rather than code,

2290
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:42,200
which had nothing to do with harassment 
at all.

2291
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:44,250
It was really just about seeing

2292
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:45,420
a woman,
uh,

2293
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:46,553
who deleted her tweet.
I haven't talked about this until now 

2294
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,750
because I,
I felt that I,

2295
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:53,460
I reacted to her deleted tweet and then 
I still,

2296
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:57,120
I still have it on my computer,
but I didn't want to bring it up.

2297
01:55:57,121 --> 01:55:59,480
And then I was left holding the bag.
Right.

2298
01:55:59,710 --> 01:56:01,170
Um,
what was the tweet?

2299
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,640
It was something like,
dear Google,

2300
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:08,750
I don't teach my daughter to run to hr 
for financial freedom rather than code.

2301
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,840
Thanks a dad.
And that was interpreted as like,

2302
01:56:12,841 --> 01:56:13,770
oh,
suck it up.

2303
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:16,050
If you're being harassed in the 
workplace,

2304
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:18,780
you know,
do not suck it up.

2305
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:20,790
If you were being harassed in the 
workplace,

2306
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:21,713
I don't know how to make that clearer,
but it's about if somebody is talking 

2307
01:56:25,231 --> 01:56:27,480
like a biologist and they're saying,
oh,

2308
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:31,760
well there's pre prenatal testosterone 
and um,

2309
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,630
you know,
they're the psychometrics and there,

2310
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:36,840
these are the conserved differences 
across cultures.

2311
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:38,543
That's not a reason to go to hr.
That's a reason to figure out whether 

2312
01:56:40,711 --> 01:56:44,220
the person is making sense,
not making sense to take them on,

2313
01:56:44,221 --> 01:56:46,490
in the arguments.
Um,

2314
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:47,363
that's,
I feel very passionately that discourse 

2315
01:56:50,281 --> 01:56:52,960
and free speech is incredibly important.
When you,

2316
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:54,043
you distort what that guy was saying and
you turn it into this hateful attack on 

2317
01:56:57,661 --> 01:56:58,494
women.
You've shut down discourse and you 

2318
01:57:00,610 --> 01:57:01,443
discourage anybody else that has any 
sort of unusual opinion or unusual 

2319
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:09,960
observation from coming forth because 
you're essentially,

2320
01:57:09,961 --> 01:57:12,750
you're limiting free speech to free 
speech that you agree with.

2321
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,790
And this is what happened while I agree 
with this,

2322
01:57:14,791 --> 01:57:16,590
but think about how difficult it has 
been.

2323
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:18,060
You know,
as soon as I say,

2324
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:23,090
learn how to over promise and over 
deliver on risk under delivering that,

2325
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:27,000
that,
that can take up 10 minutes.

2326
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:29,080
Like,
are you telling me to bullshit and not,

2327
01:57:29,250 --> 01:57:29,820
not come through?

2328
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:31,300
No,
I'm not saying that what I'm saying,

2329
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:36,590
but all of these higher level points all
have lower level misinterpretations.

2330
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:39,330
Right?
And so in this circumstance,

2331
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:40,193
it's also important to realize that 
after so many years of putting up with 

2332
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:48,660
sort of whisper campaigns,
it is understandable that women are sick

2333
01:57:48,661 --> 01:57:49,530
of this shit.
Right?

2334
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:51,690
So that's true to that too.
Right?

2335
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:53,363
So the key question is,
are we going to just deep platform all 

2336
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:56,604
the biologists,
are we going to pretend that there are 

2337
01:57:59,101 --> 01:57:59,934
no differences?
Are we going to pretend that gender and 

2338
01:58:01,201 --> 01:58:03,840
sex have absolutely nothing to do with 
each other?

2339
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:05,183
Like this sort of fantasy life that you 
can try to lead a in a progressive 

2340
01:58:11,461 --> 01:58:15,960
context is going to destroy the 
underpinnings of Western civilization.

2341
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:18,600
And I have nothing against eastern 
civilization,

2342
01:58:18,601 --> 01:58:20,490
but I'm an exponent of Western 
civilization.

2343
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,290
Yeah.
And you know,

2344
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:23,124
this gets back to the issue of will we 
be able to talk anywhere in a safe 

2345
01:58:27,211 --> 01:58:28,044
enough fashion that we can have really 
meaningful conversations so that we can 

2346
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:34,780
actually fix these fucking problem.
Right.

2347
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:35,633
And the only way you're going to fix 
these problems is if you cut out all 

2348
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:39,910
this,
the,

2349
01:58:39,970 --> 01:58:42,070
the,
the ideological biases

2350
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:44,240
on the right and the left,
uh,

2351
01:58:44,241 --> 01:58:46,690
the male and the female,
and just look at the problem for what it

2352
01:58:46,691 --> 01:58:47,380
really is.
Well,

2353
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:52,380
and it's tough and we're challenged 
because we also don't see ourselves,

2354
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:57,210
but just firing that guy for that memo.
And then here's the,

2355
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,770
my favorite part of my all time favorite
part.

2356
01:59:01,330 --> 01:59:05,440
They invited women to take time off 
because it was so stressful.

2357
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:07,291
I mean,
you are,

2358
01:59:07,291 --> 01:59:11,230
you are reinforcing the worst 
stereotypes that someone couldn't ever.

2359
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,073
You've actually read the memo and it was
so disturbing to you that you had to 

2360
01:59:15,761 --> 01:59:16,594
take time off.
You are insanely fragile or you're 

2361
01:59:20,711 --> 01:59:23,560
looking for time off.
You're looking to take time off.

2362
01:59:23,650 --> 01:59:24,483
Either one of those things reinforces 
the worst stereotypes that people have 

2363
01:59:27,461 --> 01:59:29,520
against women.
Yeah,

2364
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:30,363
but what if the idea is different?
What if the idea is that they've 

2365
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:37,600
actually been experiencing trauma at 
somebody else's hands?

2366
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,580
That wasn't James Demore.
Okay,

2367
01:59:39,581 --> 01:59:44,130
but that's not about the James Damore 
memo and I have it done right?

2368
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,033
Why have it?
But you're having it directly in 

2369
01:59:47,621 --> 01:59:48,454
response to that guy's a memo,
which wasn't in any way derogatory 

2370
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:52,084
conversation.
I go to India and I see a bunch of 

2371
01:59:53,441 --> 01:59:56,800
backwards swastikas with dots and then 
that have nothing to do with Nazis.

2372
01:59:57,430 --> 01:59:59,080
Right.
I'm a fucking triggered when we're going

2373
01:59:59,081 --> 02:00:00,760
far though.
We're pretty far away from that.

2374
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:03,880
Let's just talk about the internal memo 
that Google sense like why?

2375
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:06,670
Why give women off if you.
Well,

2376
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,620
first of all,
don't fire that fucking guy.

2377
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:11,200
Have a conversation with them and have 
open discourse.

2378
02:00:11,201 --> 02:00:14,800
The biggest problem was firing because 
that establishes the precedent.

2379
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:19,120
That truck look.
I called him up specifically to ask what

2380
02:00:19,121 --> 02:00:21,790
the hell happened?
And you know you've talked to him.

2381
02:00:21,791 --> 02:00:25,030
Yes.
He's soft spoken.

2382
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:26,740
Very kind,
very nice guy.

2383
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,220
James is pretty open so I'm going to say
he's wildly introverted,

2384
02:00:30,221 --> 02:00:32,230
almost certainly on the spectrum for 
sure.

2385
02:00:32,231 --> 02:00:33,064
And his reaction was that I went to a 
meeting where they tried to teach 

2386
02:00:35,501 --> 02:00:37,480
diversity.
The biology was wrong.

2387
02:00:37,481 --> 02:00:40,900
They asked if I had any feedback.
I told them and he wrote an 18 page man,

2388
02:00:40,901 --> 02:00:43,840
but don't write this.
This is how his brain thinks,

2389
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:47,110
which is why he's a coder,
which is why he was a biologist,

2390
02:00:47,111 --> 02:00:49,660
which is why champion the right,
exactly.

2391
02:00:49,661 --> 02:00:50,494
This is how it's very important that 
these people not be made unwelcome 

2392
02:00:54,401 --> 02:00:55,234
because fundamentally we're going 11 
this untried social justice stuff in 

2393
02:00:58,751 --> 02:01:00,340
absolutely every well.
Not only that,

2394
02:01:00,341 --> 02:01:03,850
he was labeled as a misogynist over and 
over and over again,

2395
02:01:03,851 --> 02:01:06,480
and you don't even giving the guy a 
chance to have a communication.

2396
02:01:06,510 --> 02:01:10,510
We have open communication like if you 
sit down with them instead of firing.

2397
02:01:10,511 --> 02:01:12,820
Problem is,
is that if you say,

2398
02:01:14,410 --> 02:01:17,260
come to the seminar,
we're going to teach you things.

2399
02:01:17,290 --> 02:01:19,870
The things are wrong and now we want 
your feedback.

2400
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:23,140
You're just setting certain minds up for
this thing for sure.

2401
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:26,260
That said,
and this is something I,

2402
02:01:26,330 --> 02:01:27,163
I,
I,

2403
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:29,440
this is much harder to bring to this 
room,

2404
02:01:30,190 --> 02:01:31,420
this room,
this room.

2405
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:32,590
What's wrong with,
you know,

2406
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:33,483
because I'm,
I'm part of this constellation of 

2407
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:36,970
people,
but we keep doing this.

2408
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:40,100
We keep making a mistake in my opinion,
which is we

2409
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:40,933
keep seeing these wrong things that 
happen in the space and we lose the 

2410
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:49,631
empathy in some sense because people are
not representing themselves well,

2411
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:55,580
so I believe having watched my wife and 
economics,

2412
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:01,120
that it is really corrosive to go in 
everyday to work in an environment which

2413
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,800
does not feel welcoming.
Right?

2414
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:05,210
For sure.
Very toxic,

2415
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:06,403
very bad for now.
The idea is that something breaks the 

2416
02:02:08,421 --> 02:02:12,710
camel's back and it's approximate cause 
it's not the actual problem.

2417
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:15,740
Right.
On how they framed it,

2418
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:19,080
they're saying they're giving people 
time off because there's diversity memos

2419
02:02:19,081 --> 02:02:22,220
that he targets versus hard targets.
Right?

2420
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:24,770
So the idea is is that he was a soft 
target,

2421
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:26,080
but they may have had,
you know,

2422
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:26,983
many of these women may have had a 
manager who passed them over for 

2423
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:31,303
promotions three times when they'd been.
The major contributors sort of 

2424
02:02:33,921 --> 02:02:34,754
reinforces a rational ideas about his 
memo without actually reading the core 

2425
02:02:37,941 --> 02:02:39,560
components of it and look at objects.

2426
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:40,423
Why I.
that's why I was outspoken on the point 

2427
02:02:44,211 --> 02:02:47,600
is even well,
I am outspoken on demaurice.

2428
02:02:48,330 --> 02:02:50,720
Think there's issues that believed are 
fundamentally,

2429
02:02:50,721 --> 02:02:51,554
we are in danger of breaking empathy 
with people who do not express 

2430
02:02:54,321 --> 02:02:57,290
themselves at our idiom.
And I don't like the fragility,

2431
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:59,730
I don't like the,
you know,

2432
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:05,050
there's this confusion between strong 
people versus very aggressive people and

2433
02:03:06,201 --> 02:03:07,034
in general,
stronger people are much less 

2434
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:09,464
aggressive.
Right?

2435
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:11,600
Isn't that,
that's like loud yelling.

2436
02:03:11,601 --> 02:03:12,434
People think that they're winning an 
argument because they're loud and 

2437
02:03:14,031 --> 02:03:14,864
yelling.
Well,

2438
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:18,650
if you watch like the jungle book,
Shere Khan,

2439
02:03:18,651 --> 02:03:23,030
the tiger is portrayed as unfailingly 
polite,

2440
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,400
right?
Because he's just,

2441
02:03:25,401 --> 02:03:27,350
he doesn't need to prove himself.
Right?

2442
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:31,820
So part of the problem is,
is that we are waiting for the strongest

2443
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:36,821
voices to rise above the din and say,
look,

2444
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:41,540
we can't be this aggressive about 
everything all the time.

2445
02:03:41,710 --> 02:03:42,543
Right?
We have to actually think what's a 

2446
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:45,950
misdemeanor,
a felony,

2447
02:03:45,951 --> 02:03:48,330
what's a foot fault?
You know?

2448
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:49,423
So just to boil it all down,
you don't think there's any issue with 

2449
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:56,180
inviting women to take time off from a 
memo that you didn't even disagree with?

2450
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:57,853
Um,
I absolutely think that there's a 

2451
02:04:00,381 --> 02:04:01,214
problem there,
but I don't think that that's the right 

2452
02:04:03,951 --> 02:04:07,160
place.
Google sitting on a pile of cash.

2453
02:04:07,161 --> 02:04:08,870
It doesn't need all these people to show
up.

2454
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,450
They botched this thing as far as I can 
tell.

2455
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:13,730
But why?
Why tell women take some time off?

2456
02:04:13,731 --> 02:04:14,564
You just got assaulted.
You were just attacked by some horrible 

2457
02:04:18,201 --> 02:04:21,890
thing that doesn't discourage or that 
discourages diversity.

2458
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:26,000
That discourages the right thing to do,
would be to retain demore.

2459
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,940
Right?
And to say,

2460
02:04:28,941 --> 02:04:29,774
look,
we need to be able to talk about this 

2461
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:31,993
without silencing each other with that 
terrifying each other without assuming 

2462
02:04:35,631 --> 02:04:37,190
that we've heard the other's argument.

2463
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,093
Perhaps some public speeches where you 
have people opposes ideas and have them 

2464
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,153
discuss.
Right.

2465
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:42,240
Right.
And,

2466
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:43,073
and make it public so that maybe people 
can learn from it instead of making it 

2467
02:04:45,661 --> 02:04:50,661
this gigantic campaign against one guy's
idea and just destroying his credibility

2468
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:57,261
in a very sort of perverse way.
How about just google has youtube,

2469
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:58,133
they have all the resources in the world
to turn this into an educational 

2470
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:02,640
experience.
Exactly.

2471
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:06,360
Yeah.
But the big problem was firing demore.

2472
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:07,253
Yes,
I agree with what that did was it puts 

2473
02:05:08,411 --> 02:05:09,300
out a precedent,
said,

2474
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,493
here's how this game should go.
When you hear somebody say genotype 

2475
02:05:13,891 --> 02:05:17,220
versus phenotype complain.
Yes.

2476
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,353
When you.
When something makes you uncomfortable 

2477
02:05:19,861 --> 02:05:20,694
about psychometrics complaint,
if somebody starts to agree with the 

2478
02:05:24,511 --> 02:05:25,344
implicit association tests and they 
won't own their own bigotry and bias 

2479
02:05:29,641 --> 02:05:30,710
complain.
Right?

2480
02:05:31,210 --> 02:05:32,910
Well that's terrifying.
Well,

2481
02:05:32,911 --> 02:05:33,744
it's sort of the same type of thinking 
that got your brother in hot water in 

2482
02:05:38,191 --> 02:05:41,610
Evergreen,
but what I'm trying to get at is that we

2483
02:05:41,690 --> 02:05:44,580
are,
we who understand this problem,

2484
02:05:44,581 --> 02:05:47,460
I think better than others and are 
willing to talk about it in public,

2485
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,893
are losing empathy because we're so sick
of being worn down by these terrible 

2486
02:05:54,571 --> 02:05:55,050
arguments.

2487
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:56,190
Right.
And so,

2488
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:58,540
you know,
can we,

2489
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:01,380
can we pop all the way back up to your 
original point about Islam?

2490
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:02,243
Sure.
Okay.

2491
02:06:05,630 --> 02:06:06,463
You asked the question why does the left
seemingly weirdly supportive of 

2492
02:06:11,841 --> 02:06:14,630
practices that include female genital 
mutilation,

2493
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:17,480
honor,
killing a terror,

2494
02:06:17,481 --> 02:06:18,181
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

2495
02:06:18,181 --> 02:06:19,014
et cetera.
And I think it has to do with the fact 

2496
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:24,133
that there is a fundamental inability to
discuss these issues because nobody has 

2497
02:06:32,111 --> 02:06:36,760
given us the right tools and language.
So the issue of Political Judaism,

2498
02:06:36,761 --> 02:06:41,761
political Christianity in political 
Islam is one category.

2499
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:44,920
And then there's just sort of cultural 
Judaism,

2500
02:06:44,921 --> 02:06:47,110
cultural Islam,
Cultural Christianity.

2501
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:50,980
Now quite honestly,
um,

2502
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:53,793
you can easily be embedded in a Muslim 
community that is not devoted to 

2503
02:06:58,691 --> 02:06:59,524
political Islam and feel that you're 
very much in another abrahamic faith 

2504
02:07:03,491 --> 02:07:06,910
similar to Christianity and Judaism.
On the other hand,

2505
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:11,970
there is a much bigger issue,
which is that Islam has a totality to it

2506
02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:12,963
that Judaism no longer has and that 
Christianity perhaps never had a Sam 

2507
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:21,070
Harris points the out the line render 
unto Caesar what is Caesar's,

2508
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:22,553
um,
cleaves off the potential for political 

2509
02:07:24,791 --> 02:07:28,030
Christianity at the same level as 
political Islam.

2510
02:07:28,031 --> 02:07:28,864
So you're dealing with this different 
object that doesn't quite seem to have 

2511
02:07:32,021 --> 02:07:36,220
the same characteristics as the others.
And you haven't been given tools to sort

2512
02:07:36,221 --> 02:07:37,054
of pull it apart.
You've also been taught that if you're 

2513
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:45,170
proud of European civilization,
um,

2514
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:49,600
that you are like pro white,
a white is irrelevant to me.

2515
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:50,493
I care about European civilization just 
as I care about European barbarity 

2516
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:55,750
having sat through European barbarity.

2517
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:58,240
I'm not gonna give up on European 
civilization.

2518
02:07:58,890 --> 02:07:59,723
Um,
you know,

2519
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:03,160
so in,
in part what you have is you have people

2520
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:08,161
who are making the vanilla confusion 
where they imagine that vanilla,

2521
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:10,143
you know,
we use it to mean the absence of 

2522
02:08:12,041 --> 02:08:12,874
anything interesting,
but in fact it's like the most 

2523
02:08:15,401 --> 02:08:17,140
interesting spice.
And it's this,

2524
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,960
it's this particular orchid that's 
incredibly flavorful.

2525
02:08:20,290 --> 02:08:22,900
So it's like a linguistic mistake.
Well,

2526
02:08:22,901 --> 02:08:26,500
white is that to European civilization.
I have no attachment to my whiteness.

2527
02:08:26,501 --> 02:08:28,570
I could care less,
couldn't care less.

2528
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:32,050
On the other hand,
I have a huge attachment to Newton,

2529
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:37,000
to Mozart to the terrible things that 
happened,

2530
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:38,340
uh,
you know,

2531
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,233
in the,
in the killing lands in the mid 20th 

2532
02:08:41,321 --> 02:08:42,440
century.
Um,

2533
02:08:42,850 --> 02:08:44,290
so the evil,
the good,

2534
02:08:44,590 --> 02:08:46,090
the imperialism,
the guilt,

2535
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:51,430
like that tradition.
I'm very resonant with the good,

2536
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:53,860
the bad and the ugly.
And it is my tradition.

2537
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:56,950
So when I meet somebody coming from 
China,

2538
02:08:56,951 --> 02:08:59,620
I expect them to be an exponent of 
Chinese culture.

2539
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:01,780
Well,
I don't wish to say,

2540
02:09:01,781 --> 02:09:02,614
well,
I don't have the right to have my own 

2541
02:09:03,491 --> 02:09:07,620
culture because I have to erase myself.
Um,

2542
02:09:08,170 --> 02:09:09,003
based on this confusion between this 
Canon that is incredibly value will and 

2543
02:09:13,331 --> 02:09:15,610
the skin color that is completely 
irrelevant to me.

2544
02:09:15,670 --> 02:09:16,503
I don't,
I would much rather have western 

2545
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:19,624
civilization running between the ears of
people who don't look anything like me 

2546
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:25,420
and,
you know,

2547
02:09:25,420 --> 02:09:27,940
be proud of what the software has 
produced.

2548
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:30,310
Um,
then,

2549
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:31,383
uh,
have a bunch of people who look like me 

2550
02:09:32,351 --> 02:09:33,184
who don't think in any way that I 
recognize wherever the original point 

2551
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:36,993
was.
Why does the left wider progressive's 

2552
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:42,910
fail to criticize the homophobia,
the sexism,

2553
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:45,100
the,
the honor killings,

2554
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:47,680
all the horrific acts.
So let's talk about.

2555
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:49,330
Let's talk about a particular example.

2556
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:51,700
Rolla.
Have you ever heard of him?

2557
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:52,623
Yes.
Revolutionary Afghan Women's 

2558
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:55,203
Association.
These are the,

2559
02:09:56,050 --> 02:09:58,330
these are the most bad ass chicks on the
planet.

2560
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:01,150
They are the ones who taught little 
girls under the Taliban.

2561
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:04,150
They are Muslim,
they are proud Afghan women.

2562
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:05,803
Uh,
they have Afghan men who risked their 

2563
02:10:07,301 --> 02:10:09,100
lives.
These are people who take their lives in

2564
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:12,880
their own hands to educate women.
And one of the most repressive places on

2565
02:10:12,881 --> 02:10:17,881
earth that is Islam.
Those are Muslims right now.

2566
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:22,630
My point is I try to get people 
interested in,

2567
02:10:22,631 --> 02:10:23,464
won't you take the side of the Muslims 
who hold your values or the values 

2568
02:10:29,670 --> 02:10:30,503
closest to yours?
And this is where we get into trouble 

2569
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:34,633
because for some reason we don't 
perceive that there is almost an 

2570
02:10:39,231 --> 02:10:44,231
intellectual civil war within Islam with
forces for modernity and forces that are

2571
02:10:44,781 --> 02:10:47,270
trying to reboot a,
you know,

2572
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,770
from original texts.

2573
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,793
Right.
So do you think that we associate Islam 

2574
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,113
with maybe even a smaller faction of it 
than we really understand like the isis 

2575
02:10:58,321 --> 02:10:59,760
faction,
the,

2576
02:10:59,770 --> 02:11:00,630
the,
the,

2577
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:04,100
the,
the Taliban like thing,

2578
02:11:04,110 --> 02:11:05,630
things that were terrified of.
Well,

2579
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:07,680
people that are throwing gay folks off 
buildings,

2580
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:10,910
we saw how weirdly view them as more 
authentic.

2581
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:12,510
Mm.
Um,

2582
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:13,663
in some sense.
And so you don't want to go against the 

2583
02:11:14,631 --> 02:11:17,390
authentic in aversions,
but like for example,

2584
02:11:17,391 --> 02:11:18,224
the hobbyist,
a sort of Saudi Arabian variant I never 

2585
02:11:21,351 --> 02:11:22,184
thought was going to be influential over
Pakistan because South Asians tended to 

2586
02:11:25,701 --> 02:11:27,100
look down.
Um,

2587
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:28,120
but with,
you know,

2588
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:32,120
all of this money that's been spent a 
exporting the sort of,

2589
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:36,710
um,
particularly text oriented,

2590
02:11:36,711 --> 02:11:39,500
very literal interpretations.
Uh,

2591
02:11:39,690 --> 02:11:40,523
I think we've,
we've gone down a terrible path where 

2592
02:11:42,321 --> 02:11:43,700
we've sort of,
weirdly,

2593
02:11:44,390 --> 02:11:48,860
I'm not understood that there is a 
conflict and that we actually have a dog

2594
02:11:48,861 --> 02:11:50,090
in this fight,
in the dog,

2595
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:51,223
in this fight is a,
those who are trying to create cultural 

2596
02:11:55,281 --> 02:11:56,114
Islam and cleaving off political Islam.
I don't want to live under Sharia law 

2597
02:12:01,310 --> 02:12:02,143
and I don't want to feel bad about this.
I don't want to live under anybody's 

2598
02:12:04,761 --> 02:12:05,594
religious law.
I don't want anyone to live under 

2599
02:12:06,531 --> 02:12:07,364
Halakhic Jewish law.
And this is a mainstay of Western 

2600
02:12:11,661 --> 02:12:14,690
civilization.
And when we can't feel comfortable about

2601
02:12:14,691 --> 02:12:15,231
that,
which is like,

2602
02:12:15,231 --> 02:12:16,064
well,
who are you to say whether we should 

2603
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:17,870
live in under sharia?
Law?

2604
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:20,810
Answer is,
I come from a culture myself.

2605
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:23,180
It's not like I have no culture,
this is my culture.

2606
02:12:23,181 --> 02:12:25,580
We do not live under religious law 
period.

2607
02:12:25,581 --> 02:12:26,414
The end.

2608
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,313
It's fascinating to me how very how many
different ID allowed ideologies exist 

2609
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:33,343
and how much they vary in how people can
just slot right into those and accept 

2610
02:12:37,161 --> 02:12:42,161
them as the end all be all period and 
it's to me,

2611
02:12:42,351 --> 02:12:45,740
just from a evolutionary psychology 
standpoint,

2612
02:12:45,741 --> 02:12:46,574
just looking at the broad spectrum of 
different ideologies that people slot 

2613
02:12:50,631 --> 02:12:52,700
into.
It's so fascinating.

2614
02:12:52,701 --> 02:12:53,534
It's so fascinating how many different 
mindsets that people adhere to that are 

2615
02:12:57,711 --> 02:13:01,610
unwavering and rigid and how common it 
is.

2616
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:04,700
It's so uncommon to not have an 
ideology.

2617
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:05,833
I mean,
it seems like this idea of what will 

2618
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:12,020
will the numbers that we have of 
atheists and agnostics in America today,

2619
02:13:12,021 --> 02:13:13,330
I mean,
is this unprecedented?

2620
02:13:13,331 --> 02:13:14,164
Is this the most,
the largest group of human beings ever 

2621
02:13:16,521 --> 02:13:19,670
that are looking at things and going,
maybe nobody has the answer.

2622
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:21,350
Maybe this isn't the right way.
Yeah.

2623
02:13:21,351 --> 02:13:21,800
Yeah.

2624
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:22,430
Well,
I,

2625
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:23,263
I,
but I also think that a lot of those 

2626
02:13:24,441 --> 02:13:25,274
agnostics and atheists have more 
religious leanings than they'll open up 

2627
02:13:30,530 --> 02:13:32,040
to and a lot more of the folks

2628
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:36,480
are able to run the atheist agnostic 
program almost perfectly,

2629
02:13:36,910 --> 02:13:38,580
uh,
between their ears as well.

2630
02:13:38,581 --> 02:13:40,770
I don't think it's as clean as let's 
say,

2631
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:42,360
you know,
Sam [inaudible],

2632
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:45,060
Sam Harris might make a difference what 
I was going to get to next.

2633
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:46,163
Why is it that so many people who are 
atheists and agnostics adopt religious 

2634
02:13:51,151 --> 02:13:51,984
tendencies in terms of cultural behavior
and what they're willing to accept and 

2635
02:13:55,231 --> 02:13:56,064
not willing to set,
except a lot of the stuff that you see 

2636
02:13:58,651 --> 02:13:59,484
that you're calling earlier when you 
were saying people that describe racism 

2637
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:03,480
and you know,
do,

2638
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:08,480
do you describe it as power and 
influence these cult member ideas?

2639
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:10,943
You're a lot of times getting these cult
member ideas from people that will tell 

2640
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:16,980
you that they're not a part of an 
ideology.

2641
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:17,843
They're not religious,
but they're exhibiting dogmatic 

2642
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:24,900
religious ideology.
So that was my question is,

2643
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:25,763
is it just a,
a thing that we are inherently 

2644
02:14:29,491 --> 02:14:30,950
programmed to slot into?

2645
02:14:30,990 --> 02:14:32,030
Yeah,
yeah,

2646
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:32,341
yeah,
yeah.

2647
02:14:32,341 --> 02:14:33,174
This is,
this is the big point where when Jordan 

2648
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:38,213
Peterson and Sam Harris got into it the 
first time on Sam show that was so 

2649
02:14:40,771 --> 02:14:41,790
confused and it was,
well,

2650
02:14:41,791 --> 02:14:45,090
it was confusing and Sam would have,
would have appeared to have won that one

2651
02:14:45,091 --> 02:14:45,924
pretty decisively because Jordan tried 
to fold in fitness to the definition of 

2652
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:51,240
truth.
She does not work,

2653
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:54,150
right?
Jordan's point,

2654
02:14:54,151 --> 02:14:57,570
however,
was really deep and I don't think he did

2655
02:14:57,571 --> 02:14:58,730
it,
uh,

2656
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:01,080
the service it needed to be to have 
done.

2657
02:15:01,230 --> 02:15:03,030
I think there would have been better off
in person.

2658
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:08,430
I don't like conversations where people 
are talking on skype and I've refused so

2659
02:15:08,431 --> 02:15:09,264
far to do any podcast where I'm not 
looking at the person because I believe 

2660
02:15:11,821 --> 02:15:13,700
that the eye contact too.
Yeah,

2661
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:14,543
it's huge.
I've done one so far that it was with 

2662
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:18,533
John Anthony West,
that brilliant egyptologist and it just 

2663
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:23,330
because he's was ill and he lives in New
York and it's just hard to get.

2664
02:15:23,370 --> 02:15:24,590
It was awkward.
Yeah,

2665
02:15:24,610 --> 02:15:27,240
I do it if I had to.
But in general,

2666
02:15:27,241 --> 02:15:28,074
it's like how many fights have happened 
over unicode and asked exactly just bad 

2667
02:15:33,670 --> 02:15:34,503
message board fights,
how many of them would even take place 

2668
02:15:36,601 --> 02:15:38,440
when you were looking at each other,
talking to each other.

2669
02:15:38,730 --> 02:15:40,110
Tone,
tone,

2670
02:15:40,111 --> 02:15:40,944
social cues is.
It's completely with video conferencing 

2671
02:15:43,351 --> 02:15:46,850
is that you find that you're staring 
right above the person's eyes.

2672
02:15:46,870 --> 02:15:48,230
So there's no trust.
Yes.

2673
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:49,483
So it's weird.
But what I was going to say is that 

2674
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:55,020
Jordan Peterson's really deep point is,
if I understand it.

2675
02:15:55,021 --> 02:15:55,860
So Jordan,
if you're out there,

2676
02:15:55,861 --> 02:16:00,861
please correct me.
I'm his only archetype of the kind found

2677
02:16:03,211 --> 02:16:04,044
in religion is sufficiently rich and 
deep to explain why humans behave the 

2678
02:16:08,941 --> 02:16:12,150
way they do.
There's no scientific theory that's good

2679
02:16:12,151 --> 02:16:13,920
enough.
There's no purely logical.

2680
02:16:13,921 --> 02:16:15,960
There's no purely philosophical 
tradition.

2681
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:21,180
So as of the moment we're stuck with 
deep cultural archetype.

2682
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:22,043
Maybe Shakespeare would be the only 
thing comparable to the religious 

2683
02:16:24,841 --> 02:16:25,674
cannons and the claim that you're making
implicitly in the Jordan is making 

2684
02:16:29,291 --> 02:16:34,291
perhaps more explicitly is that there's 
something about our brains maybe that we

2685
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:35,644
were parented and so we need to give the
parenting apparatus over to something 

2686
02:16:38,801 --> 02:16:39,634
else.
I don't know.

2687
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:43,270
That fundamentally finds its way to 
religion.

2688
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:45,183
Even if the computer that is our brain 
knows that it's making leaps that don't 

2689
02:16:49,541 --> 02:16:51,310
make sense.
How old are your kids?

2690
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:54,370
Mine are 12 and 15.
Do you,

2691
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:55,293
when you see them,
do you see things that are you and your 

2692
02:17:00,311 --> 02:17:02,620
wife and wonder like,
is this,

2693
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:06,730
how much of this is genetics?
How much of this is them mimicking their

2694
02:17:06,731 --> 02:17:08,620
environment?
How much of it as both.

2695
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,593
And then there's the Sui generis stuff 
that comes from God knows where that I 

2696
02:17:13,211 --> 02:17:15,010
have no idea cut into their head at all.

2697
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:16,720
Well,
culture,

2698
02:17:17,490 --> 02:17:20,050
the uh,
books and I mean don't,

2699
02:17:20,051 --> 02:17:22,540
don't discount individual invention.
Sure.

2700
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:23,820
For sure.
That too.

2701
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:29,220
So I believe that my son who's 12,
I'm has gravitated very strongly towards

2702
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:33,280
Judaism.
Um,

2703
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:37,030
so we go to services.
I don't think he believes in a technical

2704
02:17:37,031 --> 02:17:38,890
sense,
but he enjoys the service.

2705
02:17:38,990 --> 02:17:39,910
Yeah.
But you know,

2706
02:17:39,911 --> 02:17:41,560
again,
so many of us just don't.

2707
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:43,990
Well,
the music is beautiful sentiments.

2708
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:45,400
The richness.
I mean,

2709
02:17:45,401 --> 02:17:49,120
coming back to Jordan's point,
it's not.

2710
02:17:49,150 --> 02:17:51,320
Part of it was like hearing during a 
heart.

2711
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:52,183
All right,
you're in like a star wars drama or 

2712
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:59,280
you're in Kung Fu panda and don't let go
to some.

2713
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:01,071
You know,
you're,

2714
02:18:01,071 --> 02:18:05,110
you're going to a place whether it's a 
temple or a chapel or you know,

2715
02:18:05,111 --> 02:18:05,944
you're going to.
This place is uniquely ornate 

2716
02:18:09,610 --> 02:18:10,630
environment.
You know,

2717
02:18:10,690 --> 02:18:12,430
we have particular words.
For example,

2718
02:18:12,431 --> 02:18:13,660
the rabbis tell us,
you know,

2719
02:18:13,661 --> 02:18:17,530
we usually don't say this because this 
is what we have stolen from the angels,

2720
02:18:17,850 --> 02:18:18,683
but this was the one time in the year 
when we can actually shout it and it's 

2721
02:18:22,090 --> 02:18:27,090
potent staff potent and you know,
you're gonna to your original point.

2722
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:30,850
So you have some weird tradition that 
makes no sense.

2723
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:31,713
That produces it ridiculously 
disproportionate number of the Nobel 

2724
02:18:36,130 --> 02:18:37,600
prizes,
let's say in science.

2725
02:18:37,890 --> 02:18:40,360
You would it be scientific to throw that
away?

2726
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:42,190
I don't think so.
No.

2727
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:44,350
Right.
So if you were a good scientist,

2728
02:18:44,351 --> 02:18:45,184
you'd say,
I don't know what's going on with these 

2729
02:18:45,821 --> 02:18:47,020
weird rituals.
It's like,

2730
02:18:47,050 --> 02:18:48,490
you know,
it could be the funky chicken,

2731
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:50,110
you know,
or the Hokey Pokey,

2732
02:18:50,111 --> 02:18:51,480
but something is made,
you know,

2733
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:52,323
if,
if most of the people who win Nobel 

2734
02:18:53,591 --> 02:18:55,660
prizes were founded to do the Hokey 
Pokey,

2735
02:18:55,661 --> 02:18:58,270
I'd probably put more effort into it and
maybe it's not.

2736
02:18:58,950 --> 02:19:03,950
Maybe it's not attached to the ideas 
that spawn from these religions at all.

2737
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:05,823
Maybe it's that these people have the 
freedom to think about these other 

2738
02:19:08,591 --> 02:19:09,424
things because they have intense 
confidence in their future and their 

2739
02:19:12,101 --> 02:19:12,934
destiny and their God and their 
traditions and their ethics and their 

2740
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:18,040
also carved out that this.

2741
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:18,873
I've always thought of religion in some 
ways is almost being like a moral 

2742
02:19:21,221 --> 02:19:22,580
scaffolding.
Like,

2743
02:19:22,630 --> 02:19:24,850
okay,
well you got like a real clear structure

2744
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:28,310
to operate under and that that gives you
resources.

2745
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:31,130
It gives you a frees up resources to do 
other things.

2746
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:32,613
I mean,
the problem is is that the atheist 

2747
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:37,783
critique,
which is like there is no bearded dude 

2748
02:19:39,741 --> 02:19:43,740
in a cloud granting your wishes are 
listening to what you know,

2749
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:46,310
bitch.
That's my answer to you know,

2750
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:49,730
because everybody who says there's No 
God and nothing happens when you die,

2751
02:19:49,731 --> 02:19:50,564
like you don't know that to say that as 
no different than someone saying they 

2752
02:19:53,391 --> 02:19:54,224
know for sure there's a god in the cloud
with a harp and St Peter and you to go 

2753
02:19:57,450 --> 02:19:59,270
look at a list,
but if we conjure art,

2754
02:19:59,530 --> 02:20:01,850
if we conjure Sam and we tried to steal 
me and sam,

2755
02:20:01,851 --> 02:20:02,910
Sam will say,
okay,

2756
02:20:02,990 --> 02:20:06,050
but there's all these explicit ways that
you're supposed to worship God.

2757
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:07,573
They can't all be right because they're 
mutual incompatibilities and so how do 

2758
02:20:09,861 --> 02:20:11,930
you choose one among many and if and 
left,

2759
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:12,891
okay,
blah,

2760
02:20:12,891 --> 02:20:13,724
blah,
blah.

2761
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:14,743
None of this is the point.
The point is deep archetype is its own 

2762
02:20:18,171 --> 02:20:19,004
thing and the mind seeks deep archetype.
It's white cares about the godfather 

2763
02:20:23,811 --> 02:20:27,470
pictures differently than home alone.
Home alone is not deep archetype,

2764
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:30,440
godfather pictures or deep archetype.
Right?

2765
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:33,020
Okay.
This is why I'm on Kung Fu.

2766
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:34,760
Kung Fu panda,
like white on rice.

2767
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:35,623
That is deep archetypes.
Those are actually pretty God damn good 

2768
02:20:37,821 --> 02:20:39,170
movies now.
Just the first one.

2769
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:41,720
The second one is not bad.
My kids liked it.

2770
02:20:42,210 --> 02:20:45,480
They're younger than yours.
Don't hide behind my kids.

2771
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:47,510
Just I liked it.
I enjoy it.

2772
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,180
I enjoyed him.
I enjoyed the lego movies,

2773
02:20:50,181 --> 02:20:52,400
man.
I said I've never seen.

2774
02:20:52,401 --> 02:20:55,640
All of them are not bad.
This last Ninjago one's not bad.

2775
02:20:56,270 --> 02:21:00,140
I enjoy it.
So I think that just messing me.

2776
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:05,780
There's a lot of fucking dumb shit that 
I like though.

2777
02:21:05,930 --> 02:21:06,900
That said.
Really?

2778
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:07,631
Yeah.
I like it.

2779
02:21:07,631 --> 02:21:10,580
A lot of dumb shit musically.
What's some dumb shit that Jaylen Kiss?

2780
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:16,290
That is dumb shit.
Every now and then man,

2781
02:21:17,391 --> 02:21:19,100
I'm on my way to the comedy store.
I'll throw on.

2782
02:21:19,101 --> 02:21:21,590
I was made for loving you.
It was fun.

2783
02:21:23,810 --> 02:21:24,650
Yeah.
That's not so bad.

2784
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:28,070
But I prefer angus young in school.
Boy Pay.

2785
02:21:28,090 --> 02:21:30,170
I don't mind it either.
I like him as well.

2786
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:30,920
Yeah.
Look,

2787
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:33,160
I like all kinds of music.
But um,

2788
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:36,440
I,
I wonder when it comes to archetypes,

2789
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:37,333
whether or not when I was getting to,
when I was talking about your sons and 

2790
02:21:41,061 --> 02:21:41,894
your children,
whether or not their behavior is 

2791
02:21:43,191 --> 02:21:45,650
genetic,
whether or not it's learned experience,

2792
02:21:45,651 --> 02:21:47,030
whether it's a combination of all 
things,

2793
02:21:47,330 --> 02:21:50,600
how much of what we have is just in 
these,

2794
02:21:50,601 --> 02:21:51,434
this sort of inclination towards 
ideologies is because pretty much 

2795
02:21:55,821 --> 02:22:00,821
everybody had them for the thousands and
thousands and thousands of years that we

2796
02:22:00,951 --> 02:22:01,784
had civilization and we are in some way 
shape or form the product of all that 

2797
02:22:07,191 --> 02:22:08,690
stuff.
Even genetically,

2798
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:11,810
like whatever memories.
I don't totally understand genetics,

2799
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:16,700
but what I do understand is that there's
a lot that we don't know about why ideas

2800
02:22:16,701 --> 02:22:20,120
get transferred from father to son,
from children,

2801
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:23,540
from parents to children.
And there's things that get transferred.

2802
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:26,130
Even two adopted kids that come directly

2803
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:29,430
from their parents in a very eerie way 
where you go,

2804
02:22:29,431 --> 02:22:30,264
well,
where did,

2805
02:22:30,390 --> 02:22:32,550
is there some like what?
Our instincts,

2806
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:33,443
why?
Why are children are afraid of spiders 

2807
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:36,720
and monsters?
Like what is that?

2808
02:22:36,721 --> 02:22:37,554
Is it because at one point in time 
someone near them was killed by a big 

2809
02:22:40,741 --> 02:22:42,000
cat,
you know,

2810
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:43,670
thousands of years ago,
you know,

2811
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:44,543
back when we were living in these 
environments where we were preyed upon 

2812
02:22:48,091 --> 02:22:49,410
by predators.
I mean,

2813
02:22:49,411 --> 02:22:51,120
what,
what are the reasons why?

2814
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:53,550
And Rupert sheldrake had a great point 
about that.

2815
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:56,550
If you talk to children in New York 
City,

2816
02:22:56,970 --> 02:22:57,803
they're not afraid of child molesters or
murderers or things that they might 

2817
02:23:00,991 --> 02:23:05,940
encounter a car accidents.
They're afraid of monsters like w why?

2818
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:06,983
What is a monster and that monster may 
very well be the memory or the ancient 

2819
02:23:11,551 --> 02:23:13,790
genetic memory.
I think it's this.

2820
02:23:14,010 --> 02:23:15,090
I mean,
I think if you look at,

2821
02:23:15,091 --> 02:23:16,860
for example,
the evil stepmother,

2822
02:23:17,250 --> 02:23:18,210
oh,
well that's real too,

2823
02:23:18,211 --> 02:23:18,420
right?

2824
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:18,990
Okay.
Yeah,

2825
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:22,230
but what was that about?
Probably it had to do with the fact that

2826
02:23:22,231 --> 02:23:25,320
the first thing that you want to teach 
your children is,

2827
02:23:25,321 --> 02:23:26,154
hey,
if I'm not around and daddy remarries 

2828
02:23:28,701 --> 02:23:31,290
somebody who has no interest in you 
genetically,

2829
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:35,520
here's the emergency break glass in case
of emergency plan.

2830
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:36,990
Right?
There's a little of that,

2831
02:23:36,991 --> 02:23:37,824
but it's also,
how many times does that play out where 

2832
02:23:40,321 --> 02:23:43,850
someone has to tell that story because 
it's so common.

2833
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:45,510
We all know it.
We all know the story.

2834
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:46,553
I have a good friend of mine who was 
essentially tortured by a stepfather or 

2835
02:23:49,981 --> 02:23:51,570
throughout growing up.
I mean,

2836
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:56,310
it has a horrific life story and it's 
just one of a million,

2837
02:23:56,311 --> 02:23:59,300
one of millions.
But sometimes what we do is we,

2838
02:23:59,420 --> 02:24:03,510
we sort of go obliquely at these things.
So for example,

2839
02:24:03,511 --> 02:24:05,580
in Little Red Riding Hood,
um,

2840
02:24:06,210 --> 02:24:08,700
you know,
is the Fox Fox or there's the wolf,

2841
02:24:08,701 --> 02:24:09,380
sorry,
as a wolf.

2842
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:12,420
A wolf.
The wolf actually wolf stand in.

2843
02:24:13,410 --> 02:24:14,243
Well,
I think it's a wolf because throughout 

2844
02:24:15,301 --> 02:24:18,450
Europe,
fourth fucking thousands of years.

2845
02:24:18,570 --> 02:24:19,403
Wolves preyed on the wolf is pretty 
creepy in this kind of thing because 

2846
02:24:22,891 --> 02:24:24,630
wolves are clever,
you know?

2847
02:24:24,810 --> 02:24:25,643
Do you know that in Paris,
in I think the early 14 hundreds wolves 

2848
02:24:28,861 --> 02:24:31,380
killed something.
Like what was the number,

2849
02:24:31,410 --> 02:24:36,410
some insane number of people in Paris,
like 14 people were killed by wolves.

2850
02:24:37,011 --> 02:24:37,500
No,
I didn't know.

2851
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:40,530
In Paris they're starting to show up in 
Paris again.

2852
02:24:40,590 --> 02:24:43,520
Okay,
what was her fucking dangerous land?

2853
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:44,453
It will look.
So I think everybody that everybody 

2854
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:46,923
respects the wolf,
but they're clever yesterday about 

2855
02:24:48,901 --> 02:24:49,734
wolves is they.
They have some sort of template for the 

2856
02:24:51,991 --> 02:24:54,630
better to see you with my dear.
Right?

2857
02:24:54,631 --> 02:24:57,630
Because he was being clever mean.
Okay,

2858
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:59,490
but you asked the question about 
predators.

2859
02:24:59,590 --> 02:25:01,770
Somebody the big bad wolf,
the three pigs.

2860
02:25:01,771 --> 02:25:04,490
It's all wolves.
There's a lot of wolves and ancient folk

2861
02:25:04,491 --> 02:25:05,324
lore and stay the fuck out of the woods.
It's always stay out of the woods 

2862
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:09,970
because there's wolves in the woods,
right?

2863
02:25:10,730 --> 02:25:12,780
So what's the woods is in central park?
No,

2864
02:25:12,781 --> 02:25:15,210
it's real woods.
People live near the fucking woods.

2865
02:25:15,211 --> 02:25:17,910
They weren't new doors and those kinds 
of cities.

2866
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:20,670
When they wrote these stories,
when the grimm brothers were around,

2867
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:22,710
there was no central park,
right?

2868
02:25:23,130 --> 02:25:23,980
Yeah.
All I'm

2869
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,813
suggesting is that a lot of our 
information comes coated so that it 

2870
02:25:27,761 --> 02:25:30,490
doesn't point to directly.
Maybe,

2871
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:33,730
maybe stepmothers.
Zircons and wolves are dangerous.

2872
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:38,500
Stepmothers.
I take no responsibility for this man.

2873
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:39,573
There's a lot of amazing stepmothers.
Now let's say 30 seconds worth of 

2874
02:25:42,041 --> 02:25:43,200
things.
That's wonderful step,

2875
02:25:43,201 --> 02:25:48,100
but there's amazing step mothers,
but there's obviously some monsters.

2876
02:25:48,220 --> 02:25:51,190
There's obviously some monster,
but just to your point,

2877
02:25:51,210 --> 02:25:52,640
it's not always step mother,
step father.

2878
02:25:52,641 --> 02:25:56,620
The question is what happens when Mommy 
or daddy remarries?

2879
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:59,500
Sometimes it's awesome.
Right?

2880
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:01,110
Often it's not.
Right.

2881
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:02,133
And why?
Because of this issue about genetic 

2882
02:26:03,881 --> 02:26:05,790
relatedness.
So sure to you,

2883
02:26:05,970 --> 02:26:08,230
to your earlier question,
I was stunned.

2884
02:26:08,290 --> 02:26:12,310
I didn't think about 23 and me as a 
religious test,

2885
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:17,140
but when I sent my saliva off to be 
analyzed,

2886
02:26:17,141 --> 02:26:17,974
it came back.
You were a Jew like 98 point six 

2887
02:26:20,861 --> 02:26:22,390
percent.
Well I didn't.

2888
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:24,250
I didn't know my religion was in my 
saliva.

2889
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:25,690
It didn't even occur to me.

2890
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:29,010
Yeah.
But it's a.

2891
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:31,360
But that's the weird thing about Jews,
right?

2892
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:34,240
Is that it's a religion,
but it was also an ethnicity.

2893
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:35,193
Right,
right,

2894
02:26:35,230 --> 02:26:36,063
right.
And so the idea is that all of these 

2895
02:26:37,211 --> 02:26:37,931
rules,
you know,

2896
02:26:37,931 --> 02:26:42,931
dietary restrictions or rules for who 
gets to Mary,

2897
02:26:43,410 --> 02:26:47,320
at what level in the culture,
where do you put your resources?

2898
02:26:47,321 --> 02:26:50,470
Are you proselytizing or do you try to 
live at steady state?

2899
02:26:50,471 --> 02:26:51,304
Do discourage people converting in all 
of these things or some sort of toolkit 

2900
02:26:54,821 --> 02:26:57,840
for living and it has produced more 
physicists,

2901
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:59,610
uh,
then,

2902
02:26:59,611 --> 02:27:00,630
um,
you know,

2903
02:27:00,670 --> 02:27:02,680
outfielders,
right?

2904
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:05,020
So it's not good at everything.
It's good.

2905
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:05,883
Some things at the exclusion of others.
And so the question about how does the 

2906
02:27:08,671 --> 02:27:09,504
stuff co travel,
it co travels in some way that's very 

2907
02:27:13,811 --> 02:27:15,600
mysterious,
you know,

2908
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:18,460
do we pass on trauma?
Uh,

2909
02:27:18,730 --> 02:27:19,563
I can say in my family for sure that my 
family stopped being religious when my 

2910
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:28,480
great uncle Sasha was killed right at 
the end of World War Two.

2911
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:32,110
And my great grandmother said,
no,

2912
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:35,470
no,
compassionate God would kill somebody so

2913
02:27:35,471 --> 02:27:37,200
stupidly,
uh,

2914
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:38,523
who had so much to give to their family 
and change the family from some kind of 

2915
02:27:41,981 --> 02:27:45,280
Orthodoxy to Orthodox atheism.
And then,

2916
02:27:45,450 --> 02:27:46,283
you know,
for three generations you have Jews 

2917
02:27:47,471 --> 02:27:50,020
marrying Jews with nobody believing in 
anything.

2918
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:54,190
Why are they continuing to marry Jews?
Why are they celebrating these holidays?

2919
02:27:54,191 --> 02:27:55,024
Well,
it's because fundamentally a switch got 

2920
02:27:57,671 --> 02:27:59,770
flipped,
but my guess is that the Orthodox,

2921
02:27:59,771 --> 02:28:01,840
we're always questioning whether there 
was a god.

2922
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:02,733
The atheists are always questioning 
whether there's a god at some level 

2923
02:28:05,861 --> 02:28:10,850
because our brains are not just simple 
computers to be know,

2924
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:13,960
rid of bias.
They have particular needs.

2925
02:28:13,961 --> 02:28:14,794
So my,
my four things that I care about our 

2926
02:28:16,601 --> 02:28:19,600
truth,
fitness meaning and grace,

2927
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:22,070
all of those tradeoff amongst

2928
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,903
each other.
And when I said something like this on 

2929
02:28:23,721 --> 02:28:27,650
Sam Sam Harris's program,
a lot of the people who wrote in said,

2930
02:28:27,670 --> 02:28:28,250
Oh,
you know,

2931
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:31,930
shows that he doesn't care about truth.
And you know,

2932
02:28:31,931 --> 02:28:33,140
I,
I felt like no,

2933
02:28:33,141 --> 02:28:36,260
it just shows that you guys don't 
understand how important.

2934
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:38,150
What is the argument?
I understand the argument,

2935
02:28:38,990 --> 02:28:39,823
Sam would like to make an argument that 
the better and more rational our 

2936
02:28:43,941 --> 02:28:44,774
thinking is,
the more it can do everything that 

2937
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:51,410
religion once did.
So if you've had a dmt or lsd experience

2938
02:28:51,411 --> 02:28:53,810
that can give you meaning and 
transcendence,

2939
02:28:54,380 --> 02:28:55,790
uh,
you know,

2940
02:28:55,791 --> 02:28:58,940
if you can think your way more 
accurately through a problem,

2941
02:28:58,941 --> 02:29:01,520
that should increase your fitness.
You know,

2942
02:29:01,521 --> 02:29:02,354
maybe grace is something that's 
independent and you have to figure out 

2943
02:29:05,361 --> 02:29:07,570
whether that's important to you.
But that's a choice that an,

2944
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:08,530
you know,
an elected.

2945
02:29:09,130 --> 02:29:09,963
I'm objective and my belief is that a 
lot of these things are actually preset 

2946
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:16,070
and that there's more antagonism between
them.

2947
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:18,590
So I,
I think of myself as an atheist,

2948
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:23,750
but it's only because there's a room in 
my mind that I try to keep very,

2949
02:29:23,751 --> 02:29:27,740
very clean and analytical that I,
I sort of make the first among equals,

2950
02:29:28,310 --> 02:29:30,830
but I have needs for these other things.
I haven't,

2951
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:31,903
you know,
there are times when the truth doesn't 

2952
02:29:33,171 --> 02:29:36,140
give me enough meaning and I'll start 
storytelling.

2953
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:37,881
Okay.
You know,

2954
02:29:37,881 --> 02:29:38,810
we're,
we're surrounded.

2955
02:29:38,811 --> 02:29:40,250
We've got to fight our way out,
you know,

2956
02:29:40,251 --> 02:29:41,870
like all that kind of narrative.

2957
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:44,373
So Joseph Campbell's type stuff,
don't you think that there'd been the 

2958
02:29:46,770 --> 02:29:48,400
end,
there's lessons to be learned in those,

2959
02:29:48,401 --> 02:29:49,090
right?
But it's.

2960
02:29:49,090 --> 02:29:53,590
And there's meaning in all those stories
and there's a longing that we have for a

2961
02:29:53,591 --> 02:29:56,650
lot of those hero's journey type 
narratives.

2962
02:29:57,130 --> 02:29:57,963
But um,
but truth is significantly more 

2963
02:30:00,251 --> 02:30:03,670
important than just these lessons that 
we learned from hero's journeys.

2964
02:30:03,671 --> 02:30:06,630
Like learning the lessons is important.
They're fascinating.

2965
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:09,100
They're interesting.
The stories are amazing.

2966
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:10,113
But what's really going on?
Like what biological processes are 

2967
02:30:14,441 --> 02:30:16,990
responsible for certain types of 
behavior.

2968
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:17,790
You know,
what,

2969
02:30:17,790 --> 02:30:22,060
what really is happening to human bodies
under certain conditions.

2970
02:30:22,061 --> 02:30:22,894
What is really happening to the earth,
what is really happening as far as the 

2971
02:30:25,551 --> 02:30:26,384
mail.

2972
02:30:26,470 --> 02:30:27,303
Yeah.
My friend Peter Teal critiques me on 

2973
02:30:28,881 --> 02:30:31,580
this point just as you have where he 
says you eric,

2974
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:35,060
under value and underweight the role of 
truth,

2975
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:37,880
but I worry that we're not even having a
conversation.

2976
02:30:37,881 --> 02:30:42,170
If I think about my personal physics 
hero rock,

2977
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:43,233
uh,
who's the coyote came up with the 

2978
02:30:44,811 --> 02:30:48,200
equation for the electron less well 
known than the,

2979
02:30:48,201 --> 02:30:51,020
uh,
Einstein equations,

2980
02:30:51,021 --> 02:30:51,854
but arguably even more beautiful in 
order to predict that he needed a 

2981
02:30:57,081 --> 02:30:59,840
positively charged in a negatively 
charged particle.

2982
02:30:59,841 --> 02:31:04,520
And the only two known at the time with 
the electron and the Proton to make up,

2983
02:31:04,521 --> 02:31:07,040
let's say a hydrogen atom.
Well,

2984
02:31:07,610 --> 02:31:10,280
the Proton is quite a bit heavier than 
the electronic.

2985
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:11,953
And so he told a story that wasn't 
really true where the Proton was the 

2986
02:31:17,451 --> 02:31:20,190
antiparticle of the electron.
And Heisenberg pointed

2987
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:21,023
out that couldn't be because the masses 
are too far off and they'd have to be 

2988
02:31:23,251 --> 02:31:24,550
equal.
Well,

2989
02:31:24,551 --> 02:31:28,830
a short time later,
the anti electron positron that is,

2990
02:31:28,831 --> 02:31:29,664
was found,
I guess by Anderson at Caltech in the 

2991
02:31:32,460 --> 02:31:34,760
early thirties,
and then an anti-proton was created some

2992
02:31:34,761 --> 02:31:39,120
time later,
so it turned out that the story had more

2993
02:31:39,121 --> 02:31:42,330
meaning than the exact version of the 
story.

2994
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:44,093
So the story was sort of more true than 
the version of the story that was 

2995
02:31:47,191 --> 02:31:48,024
originally told.
And I could tell you a similar story 

2996
02:31:49,501 --> 02:31:50,970
with,
with Einstein.

2997
02:31:50,971 --> 02:31:53,760
I could tell it to you with Darwin,
um,

2998
02:31:53,940 --> 02:31:55,330
who,
you know,

2999
02:31:55,530 --> 02:31:56,363
didn't fully understand the implications
of his theory as is evidenced by his 

3000
02:32:00,061 --> 02:32:03,270
screwing up a particular kind of orchid,
uh,

3001
02:32:03,271 --> 02:32:05,100
in his later work,
uh,

3002
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:08,190
not understanding that his theory 
completely explained that orchid.

3003
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:12,720
So there's all sorts of ways in which we
get the truth wrong.

3004
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:13,553
The first several times we try it,
but the meaning of the story that we 

3005
02:32:17,911 --> 02:32:22,911
tell somehow remains intact.
And I think that that's a very difficult

3006
02:32:23,101 --> 02:32:24,810
lesson for people who just want to say,
look,

3007
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:25,973
I want to,
you know,

3008
02:32:26,010 --> 02:32:27,180
like fineman would say,
look,

3009
02:32:27,220 --> 02:32:29,700
if experiment disagrees with you than 
you're wrong.

3010
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:33,480
And it's a very appealing story to tell 
to people,

3011
02:32:33,481 --> 02:32:34,314
but it's also worth noting that 
[inaudible] never got a physical law of 

3012
02:32:36,811 --> 02:32:37,644
nature and it may be that he was too 
wedded to this kind of rude judgment of 

3013
02:32:44,401 --> 02:32:46,430
the unforgiving.
You know,

3014
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:51,440
you can imagine you were to innovate and
in Brazilian Jujitsu the first few times

3015
02:32:52,110 --> 02:32:54,900
it might not actually work,
but if you told yourself a story,

3016
02:32:54,901 --> 02:32:55,101
no,
no,

3017
02:32:55,101 --> 02:32:56,910
no,
this is actually genius,

3018
02:32:56,911 --> 02:32:57,960
and it's working,
and you're like,

3019
02:32:57,961 --> 02:33:00,390
no,
you just lost three consecutive bouts.

3020
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:02,003
Well,
that may give you the ability to 

3021
02:33:03,031 --> 02:33:04,500
eventually perfect the move.

3022
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:05,453
Perfect the technique,
even though you were lying to yourself 

3023
02:33:07,890 --> 02:33:09,810
during the period in which it was being 
set up,

3024
02:33:09,811 --> 02:33:12,840
it's a little bit like the difference 
between scaffolding and a building.

3025
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:17,370
And too often people who are crazy about
truth rejects scaffolding,

3026
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:20,940
which is an intermediate stage in 
getting to the final truth.

3027
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:21,833
So well,
the problem with that analogy is that 

3028
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,370
some techniques work,
but they just don't work for you.

3029
02:33:26,490 --> 02:33:27,323
And the reason why they don't work for 
you is you don't know them good enough 

3030
02:33:29,011 --> 02:33:30,450
yet,
right or not.

3031
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:32,400
You can eat that.
Yeah.

3032
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:33,421
We have a problem with that.
Now.

3033
02:33:33,421 --> 02:33:35,010
We can just wrap this up if you're that 
hungry.

3034
02:33:35,490 --> 02:33:36,900
We're on the homestretch,
buddy.

3035
02:33:36,901 --> 02:33:39,150
We got seven more minutes.
Can't take it anymore.

3036
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:42,960
I'm sorry.
Insulin lower issues.

3037
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:45,560
I crashed.
Listen,

3038
02:33:45,570 --> 02:33:46,680
let me just wrap this up.
Anyway,

3039
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:49,860
this is a.
This was a really fun conversation.

3040
02:33:49,890 --> 02:33:54,120
Really feel like that eating that bar.
He definitely has changed the butter.

3041
02:33:54,121 --> 02:33:55,570
Crashed it.
I know what you.

3042
02:33:55,571 --> 02:33:57,840
You were so hungry.
You had to eat in the middle of talking.

3043
02:33:58,290 --> 02:34:00,960
I was told I could go to the bathroom 
here to go to.

3044
02:34:01,170 --> 02:34:02,003
Well,
he said you could do it for like six 

3045
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:04,583
people.
Go fucking crazy when you hear people 

3046
02:34:05,671 --> 02:34:06,504
chewing on the microphone.
It was the number one thing that people 

3047
02:34:08,341 --> 02:34:11,460
complain about on this podcast.
I apologize to them.

3048
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:12,533
No worries.
We've had these fight companion podcast 

3049
02:34:14,131 --> 02:34:14,964
and people fucking potato chips and 
they're eating potato chips on the 

3050
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:18,220
podcast and I just would get

3051
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:23,320
my twitter would be filled with people 
fucking furious so slightly.

3052
02:34:23,321 --> 02:34:25,300
No,
America is hang in there too.

3053
02:34:25,301 --> 02:34:26,670
Sorry.
You gotta you gotTa.

3054
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:30,430
Be comfortable being uncomfortable like 
a couple minutes.

3055
02:34:31,300 --> 02:34:32,133
I can do it too.
What I was gonna say is that analogy is 

3056
02:34:35,921 --> 02:34:38,500
not the best analogy because some things
work.

3057
02:34:38,501 --> 02:34:42,370
They just don't work for you.
Like I'm one of the analogies as used in

3058
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:43,204
Brazilian Jujitsu is like someone will 
try a technique and it doesn't work for 

3059
02:34:46,211 --> 02:34:46,751
them,
and they're like,

3060
02:34:46,751 --> 02:34:47,890
well that took me.
It's no good.

3061
02:34:48,060 --> 02:34:48,910
And I'll say,
okay,

3062
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:51,880
well you know that head kicks work 
right?

3063
02:34:51,881 --> 02:34:54,310
You've seen people kick people in the 
head and knocked them unconscious.

3064
02:34:54,311 --> 02:34:55,144
Right.
Okay.

3065
02:34:55,470 --> 02:34:56,680
Try to kick me in the head.
Well,

3066
02:34:56,681 --> 02:34:57,730
I don't know how to kick people in the 
head.

3067
02:34:58,060 --> 02:34:58,893
There you go.
Even if I show you how well you're not 

3068
02:35:00,691 --> 02:35:01,540
gonna be able to do it.

3069
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:02,810
If I show you how to kick people in the 
head,

3070
02:35:02,811 --> 02:35:04,780
do you think you gonna be able to kick 
someone that actually knows how to fight

3071
02:35:04,781 --> 02:35:05,980
and ed?
No.

3072
02:35:06,350 --> 02:35:08,260
They're going to move that.
They're going to see it coming.

3073
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:09,153
You're gonna.
It's gonna.

3074
02:35:09,170 --> 02:35:10,003
Be too slow.
You're not going to have your neural 

3075
02:35:11,191 --> 02:35:14,530
pathways carved to the point where that 
thing just slices right in there.

3076
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:16,000
You're not going to know how to set it 
up,

3077
02:35:16,030 --> 02:35:20,320
you're not going to have the confidence 
and the experience to execute it.

3078
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:21,993
The difference between that and the 
truth is very different because it 

3079
02:35:23,921 --> 02:35:28,921
doesn't require some sort of physical 
process for you to master before you can

3080
02:35:29,351 --> 02:35:34,030
execute it with sufficient prowess to 
actually be successful.

3081
02:35:34,420 --> 02:35:37,270
While I think you know,
this has to do with placeholder truth.

3082
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:38,470
Um,
you know,

3083
02:35:38,471 --> 02:35:42,010
the famous example of tricky gnosis and 
pork,

3084
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:46,150
where if you believe that God hates 
those who eat the pig,

3085
02:35:46,650 --> 02:35:48,130
do you think that's what that's about?

3086
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:49,660
I think it's about tricking most likely,
right?

3087
02:35:49,661 --> 02:35:51,600
Or various other parasites,
right?

3088
02:35:51,710 --> 02:35:52,543
Right.
So,

3089
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:57,600
you know how long,
well,

3090
02:35:57,611 --> 02:35:58,530
malaria,
right,

3091
02:35:58,690 --> 02:36:00,790
bad air,
shellfish,

3092
02:36:01,570 --> 02:36:02,920
red tide,
right?

3093
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:04,180
Don't eat shellfish,
right?

3094
02:36:04,270 --> 02:36:09,250
So all of these things have to do with,
I'm not quite sure that I can explain to

3095
02:36:09,251 --> 02:36:10,084
you why this is a bad thing,
but let's have a placeholder and then 

3096
02:36:13,691 --> 02:36:17,710
we'll refine it over time.
Come to understand what it is that we're

3097
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:18,723
doing less.
We're rigid with our ideology and we'd 

3098
02:36:20,831 --> 02:36:21,664
go buy some ancient scripture that 
ancient scripture says that anything 

3099
02:36:24,311 --> 02:36:26,200
with a cloven hooves that eats its own 
cud.

3100
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:27,543
You know,
like there's all these weird laws like 

3101
02:36:29,231 --> 02:36:30,640
this is your,
what are you're allowed to eat.

3102
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,773
This is what you're not allowed to eat.
Except that that's very often not how 

3103
02:36:34,211 --> 02:36:35,044
things work.
So my fear is is that it's a little bit 

3104
02:36:39,731 --> 02:36:44,110
the emily latella effect on religion 
where the atheist concept of a religious

3105
02:36:44,111 --> 02:36:49,111
person is usually the sort of robot that
just looks right and in fact,

3106
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:55,480
what you often find is that you're 
rewarded for brilliance in a religion by

3107
02:36:55,481 --> 02:36:58,030
not having to follow the rules nearly as
closely.

3108
02:36:58,060 --> 02:36:58,893
If you become adept at argument,
it's sort of like really Christian 

3109
02:37:01,241 --> 02:37:02,074
people with a cross tattooed on them.
That could be right and you make some 

3110
02:37:06,311 --> 02:37:07,270
art.
Well for example,

3111
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:08,163
in Islam contract marriage where you 
need to get married for a few hours so 

3112
02:37:12,251 --> 02:37:16,040
that you can set your urges with your 
wife who

3113
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:18,410
then becomes not your wife.
A short time later,

3114
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:23,770
your arbitrage in the letter of the law 
against the need.

3115
02:37:24,530 --> 02:37:25,363
For some sort of a human realism,
so they have contract marriages where 

3116
02:37:27,951 --> 02:37:29,570
you're like,
let's get married for a day.

3117
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:31,450
Yeah,
really sweet.

3118
02:37:32,290 --> 02:37:34,610
Good move.
I think everybody should do that.

3119
02:37:34,611 --> 02:37:36,680
Just to find out what the hell that 
person's really like.

3120
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:38,780
You don't know anybody until you 
actually marry him.

3121
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:40,903
Once it was shacked up with them and 
you're living for awhile and they have 

3122
02:37:42,651 --> 02:37:43,990
access to your money,
then you want.

3123
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,250
Then you get to find out what they're 
really like.

3124
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:50,030
One point 6 billion people are 
considering your words right now.

3125
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:52,130
I don't know if it's a good thing or a 
bad thing.

3126
02:37:52,131 --> 02:37:52,964
I do think that.
I don't think that many people live in 

3127
02:37:54,090 --> 02:37:56,270
this podcast.
We're okay.

3128
02:37:57,060 --> 02:37:58,850
You know,
we had a situation I think in,

3129
02:37:58,851 --> 02:37:59,684
uh,
in the late [inaudible] in Israel where 

3130
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:05,520
people were using bread crumbs to fish,
uh,

3131
02:38:05,521 --> 02:38:06,354
as bait.

3132
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:07,370
And the question was,
will,

3133
02:38:07,371 --> 02:38:12,320
does that invalidate the entire water 
supply of Israel during Passover?

3134
02:38:12,380 --> 02:38:16,010
And so rabbi rabbis had to be convened 
and if you know,

3135
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:19,610
pay the sufficient amount of money,
genius level rabbis could figure out why

3136
02:38:19,611 --> 02:38:21,830
it was okay to drink the water during 
Passover.

3137
02:38:22,330 --> 02:38:23,163
Right?
So the issue of getting around your own 

3138
02:38:24,741 --> 02:38:29,741
rules is a time honored religious 
tradition where,

3139
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:32,560
you know,
any book that is not a book for,

3140
02:38:32,620 --> 02:38:36,090
for living in survival and thriving,
uh,

3141
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:37,063
is consigned to the dustbin of history.
And so the fact that these things have 

3142
02:38:40,131 --> 02:38:40,964
been around for so long in general means
that they have their own means of 

3143
02:38:45,111 --> 02:38:49,610
evading these self extinguishing 
programs that would seem to doom them.

3144
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:51,500
Well,
some of them,

3145
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:55,520
those self extinguishing programs,
the way they evaded is through fear,

3146
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:56,361
right?
I mean,

3147
02:38:56,361 --> 02:38:59,870
isn't that the fear by Isel cheating on 
them?

3148
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:00,711
Yeah.
Right.

3149
02:39:00,711 --> 02:39:02,720
And so the is of,
you know,

3150
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:05,540
if you attack on Yom Kippor,
uh,

3151
02:39:05,930 --> 02:39:07,880
does that mean you can't fight back 
because you should.

3152
02:39:07,970 --> 02:39:09,620
You're supposed to be atoning for your 
sins.

3153
02:39:09,621 --> 02:39:10,880
Now,
if you want to survive,

3154
02:39:10,881 --> 02:39:12,890
you're going to figure out a way to 
fight on Yom Kippor.

3155
02:39:12,930 --> 02:39:13,910
Well,
what about Ramadan?

3156
02:39:14,990 --> 02:39:17,060
I guarantee you,
nobody,

3157
02:39:17,210 --> 02:39:19,760
you know,
if it were so easy to defeat people,

3158
02:39:19,830 --> 02:39:20,663
uh,
using their own religious traditions 

3159
02:39:21,621 --> 02:39:22,620
against them,
uh,

3160
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:24,950
we wouldn't know the name of these 
religions and we wouldn't,

3161
02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:26,930
we wouldn't know the genius of the 
books.

3162
02:39:26,931 --> 02:39:29,220
How many did we lose?
How many religions,

3163
02:39:29,221 --> 02:39:32,470
if we forgot what they were and be like,
Joe and Ted's excellent religion.

3164
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:36,840
I would ever just didn't make the cut,
you know?

3165
02:39:36,841 --> 02:39:37,674
I mean,
how many from epic of Gilgamesh from 

3166
02:39:39,681 --> 02:39:42,230
those days I would,
I would guess tons.

3167
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:44,600
What'd they call it?
What was the heaven's gate?

3168
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:45,523
Remember the Nike's that killed 
themselves when the comment or the self 

3169
02:39:49,720 --> 02:39:51,190
castrating yeah.
Yeah.

3170
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,033
The one guy who led it was a self 
cashiering issue with the Shaker 

3171
02:39:55,220 --> 02:39:56,053
furniture that they were down to like 
one or there were three shakers at some 

3172
02:39:59,481 --> 02:40:00,314
point.
Then there was like one and they were 

3173
02:40:01,071 --> 02:40:02,100
accepting.
No note,

3174
02:40:02,110 --> 02:40:04,610
no new recruits.
My favorite is the amish.

3175
02:40:05,030 --> 02:40:07,250
They have that a,
is that called Rom scholar?

3176
02:40:07,251 --> 02:40:11,300
What does that crazy thing go nuts.
They go nuts for like a year from spring

3177
02:40:11,301 --> 02:40:14,130
it out is.
That was one year where they just

3178
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:16,470
go fucking hog wild.
They don't have to follow the rules,

3179
02:40:16,471 --> 02:40:19,080
and then they usually feel so lost and 
disconnected that they,

3180
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:22,200
they.
I think the majority of them returned to

3181
02:40:22,201 --> 02:40:23,790
being amish.
Is that right?

3182
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:24,271
Yeah.
Yeah.

3183
02:40:24,271 --> 02:40:25,680
I'm pretty sure find their way to 
burning man.

3184
02:40:27,130 --> 02:40:28,280
No,
I don't think they go that kind of now,

3185
02:40:28,281 --> 02:40:30,630
so I think it's more like booze and ACDC
type nuts.

3186
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:33,990
They just fuck a lot and get crazy and 
throw rocks.

3187
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:35,413
You know what I'm going to.
I'm going to look for the Amish camp 

3188
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:38,640
next year.
Eric.

3189
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:42,090
This is a really beautiful conversation.
Exceeded my expectations.

3190
02:40:42,091 --> 02:40:44,490
I really enjoyed it and we should do 
this more often,

3191
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:46,110
Joe.
Thanks for a terrific.

3192
02:40:46,111 --> 02:40:47,910
Thanks man.
All right folks.

3193
02:40:47,911 --> 02:40:51,340
We'll be back tomorrow with the great 
and powerful Christina possessed ski.

3194
02:40:51,390 --> 02:40:54,510
Who's Netflix special is out today.
Hey.
