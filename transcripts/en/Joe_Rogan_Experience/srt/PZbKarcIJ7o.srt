00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,780
What about the idea is that the universe
is in a constant state of contraction

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,783
and expansion?

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,430
No,

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,721
it's up.

6
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:11,221
Been abandoned.

7
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,600
Some physicists to argue that it's,

8
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,530
there's a cycle because it
looks nice and they are.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,520
I think most of most people,

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,020
I mean there's some people
who were arguing for that,

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,633
trying to take pictures.

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,360
Well,

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,140
I think they're trying to
type their ignorance and
something that isn't any more

14
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:28,290
plausible in the picture that it expands
forever and as far as we can tell,

15
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:32,700
the most likely possibilities that are
universal expand forever fought to make

16
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:33,780
you a little bit happier.

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,340
It's quite possible.

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
The best pictures that we have of our,

19
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:37,951
of,

20
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:38,310
of,

21
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,110
of the early universe is that we actually,

22
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:41,520
our universe isn't unique,

23
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,271
isn't alone.

24
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,470
That there are many universes,

25
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,740
we call it a multiverse and that at any
instant in time and kind of a cosmic

26
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,883
super time,

27
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,150
there's always university being born
so that that multi-verse might be,

28
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,190
might be infinite and eternal.

29
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,590
Where are they outside of our universe?

30
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,640
How's that even possible?

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,031
Of course,

32
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,690
it's possible.

33
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,523
I understand.

34
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,393
Okay.

35
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,591
Well,

36
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,424
first of all,

37
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,100
the simplest possibility is
that they're outside the region.

38
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,310
We can see right for,

39
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:10,920
for,

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,671
for example,

41
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,230
the edge is our visible universe.

42
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:17,820
Space is expanding faster away from
us than light because you know,

43
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,600
we taught you in school,

44
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,930
nothing can travel faster than light.

45
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:21,160
And you may remember that from scratch.

46
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,133
We lied.

47
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,263
Okay,

48
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:23,790
well no,

49
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,200
you have to parse it more carefully.

50
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,034
Like a lawyer.

51
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,560
Nothing can travel through
space faster than light,

52
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,990
but space can do whatever
the hell it wants.

53
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,370
So locally,

54
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,181
as I told you though,

55
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,014
radio host is,

56
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,820
is at rest they're not moving.

57
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:38,940
And and the other end of the galaxy at
the other end of the visible universe and

58
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,570
we're rest,

59
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,760
but the space between us is expanding.

60
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,840
So that galaxy,

61
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,980
like a surfer is being carried away from
us faster than light relative to the

62
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,670
water.

63
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,780
The surfer is moving,

64
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,161
right?

65
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,330
But relative to the shore,

66
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,250
the surfer is right,

67
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:53,820
right.

68
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,510
Okay.

69
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,740
So this,

70
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,830
this galaxy is not moving relative
to its local surroundings,

71
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,380
but it's moving away from
us faster than light.

72
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
And like a surfer in an undertow,

73
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,340
they can swim really fast in the water,

74
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,080
but if the water's moving
away from the shore,

75
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,310
they'll never make it back to the shore.

76
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,480
Right.

77
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,740
And so that galaxy,

78
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:14,040
the light from that galaxy is traveling
through space at the speed of light.

79
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,220
But it's the space in between us and
the galaxies moving faster than light.

80
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,380
Then the poor light
can ever make it to us.

81
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,000
We call that a horizon.

82
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,190
Wow.

83
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,190
So the space is traveling too far
for the light to reach us so fast.

84
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,930
The triple spaces too fast.

85
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:34,740
So this light can't catch up with the
expansion of space and it never gets to

86
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:35,574
us.

87
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,140
And that that galaxy disappears
from our causal horizon.

88
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,570
We call it will never be able to see it.

89
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,510
We'll never be able to interact
with it will never be okay.

90
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,150
And it could be that,

91
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,980
that there are different
regions so far away from us.

92
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,440
We're space is expanding
faster than light,

93
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,220
which,

94
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,100
which have a very different
history than our own.

95
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,290
So there could be space,

96
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,020
could be infinite,

97
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,910
just our simple unit space that we know
of and love could be infinite in extent

98
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,590
and different regions of that space had
different histories and some of those

99
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,424
regions,

100
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
everything we can see,

101
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,670
we know emerged from a single point.

102
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,571
Okay.

103
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,440
We can tell that.

104
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,770
We can tell that by measuring the big
bang expansion of everything we see and

105
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,500
working backwards and the university,

106
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,690
our visible universe was once
smaller and smaller and smaller.

107
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,524
If you go back in time,

108
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,740
we can actually follow the laws of physics
back to the earliest moments of the

109
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,800
big bang until those laws break down
and we can make predictions about the

110
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,634
university would look like.

111
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,550
All those predictions agree exactly
what the observations we make,

112
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,170
which tells us that that picture works.

113
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,400
But another region,

114
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,061
if you wish,

115
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:38,470
could have come from a different big bang,

116
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,860
but is that another universe or
is it a part of the university?

117
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,220
Here's how we've changed
and this is semantics,

118
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,810
but nontrivial semantics,

119
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,640
namely when I was a kid,

120
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,890
universe meant every everything,

121
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:51,340
right?

122
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,290
But we say that's it's
pretty stupid definition.

123
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,660
A better definition is an operational one.

124
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,300
Universe means that region of space
with which at one time we could have

125
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:04,300
communicated or one time in the future,

126
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,500
even if the future is infinite,

127
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,030
we might communicate with,

128
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,670
because that describes the region of
space where cause and effect works some

129
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:13,900
measurable distance.

130
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,590
Yes.

131
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,950
And so that are we think of a universe
is that region which could throughout

132
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,810
which everything could affect everything
else ultimately in an infinitely long

133
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,644
time.

134
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,990
And in that picture,

135
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,320
universes can be restricted in size.

136
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,910
And then other regions which could never
have affected us and which will never

137
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:35,080
affect us in the future.

138
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,940
We call other universes.

139
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,300
Uh,

140
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,651
and when,

141
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:38,810
and,

142
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,260
and now there are many different
versions of a multiverse,

143
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
but that's the simplest version.

144
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,250
And this picture we call inflation,

145
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,380
which,

146
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,900
uh,

147
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,171
you know,

148
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,004
I talk,

149
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,260
I just did two little clips
associated with the new book,

150
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,440
one force for a publisher
and one was for big.

151
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,520
Think one is,

152
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:55,030
uh,

153
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,290
the universe and under two minutes.

154
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,220
So you can look up online,

155
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:57,971
look for Lawrence Krauss,

156
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:00,700
explains the universe in under two
minutes where I talk about this cosmic

157
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,070
expansion and how it might
mean there's a multiverse.

158
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,241
But the other is,

159
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:04,930
um,

160
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,290
I explained the universe in terms of this
beer bottle that I talked about to you

161
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:08,651
earlier.

162
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,400
So you can,

163
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,061
that's a video,

164
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:10,894
you can watch that.

165
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,860
But it,

166
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:12,910
this theory of inflation,

167
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,070
which actually says are universal.

168
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,910
The,

169
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,570
the qualities that we see of our universe
can best be explained if some early

170
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:23,740
time in the history of the universe when
it was a billionth of a billionth of a

171
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,050
billionth of a billionth of a second old.

172
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,410
It had a huge expansion
suddenly and increased in
size by 30 orders of magnitude

173
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,244
in size,

174
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,140
in a billionth of a billionth of a
billionth of a billionth of a second.

175
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,030
Which is by the way,

176
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,390
particle physics suggests is
highly plausible even though,

177
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,350
okay.

178
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,800
And then,

179
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,251
and then,

180
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,880
and then it would produce a university.

181
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:47,740
It looks more or less like we look
like you look like and and uh,

182
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,171
and it,

183
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:51,820
and it's right now the only explanation
of what of how that would cause the

184
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:52,654
universe to look like,

185
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,590
what it looks like.

186
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,380
But the neat thing about
inflation is it's eternal.

187
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,620
So inflation that puffing up and
in our universe and then boom,

188
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:00,891
a hot,

189
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,880
big bang followed it.

190
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,331
Okay.

191
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:02,960
So the region,

192
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,560
universe,

193
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,140
universe puffed up by huge amount than
all of that energy which was stored in

194
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:07,974
empty space,

195
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,700
got released like in the
beer bottle and we got a hot,

196
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,800
Big Bang and the rest is history,

197
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,250
but that's locally but somewhere else
at between us and their space is still

198
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:23,150
expanding exponentially and faster
and faster and faster and only maybe

199
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,170
somewhere else today.

200
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:24,891
Boom.

201
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,020
Like an ice crystal forming boom,

202
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,090
that that region of space is suddenly
left inflation and maybe a guilt a

203
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,561
gazillion years in the future,

204
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:35,660
they'll be another region of space
that's expanding away from a summit much

205
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,361
faster than light.

206
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:37,194
So we'll never know about it.

207
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,750
We're suddenly that region,

208
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,130
these inflation and boom,

209
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,870
another hot big bang happens.

210
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,340
And it turns out in each of those hot,

211
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,174
big bangs,

212
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,220
after the inflation ends,

213
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,480
depending upon how it ends,

214
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,200
the laws of physics could be
different in that universe and that,

215
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,380
so we tend to think it's quite
likely that there are many,

216
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,180
many separate regions of space.

217
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,351
And in fact,

218
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,184
it's eternal.

219
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,940
So such regions or are forming
eternally for all time and,

220
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,390
and,

221
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,111
and there are hot,

222
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:06,950
big bangs happening in many regions and
the properties of each of those regions,

223
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,380
whether they're conducive to forming
galaxies and stars and planets and people

224
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,101
may be different.

225
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,710
So we could say logically in that picture,

226
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,300
that the reason the universe looks like
the way it does is because we're here to

227
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,134
measure it.

228
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,921
Oh my God,

229
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,000
we should leave it at that.

230
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,450
Okay.

231
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,410
We should close with that.

232
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,260
That is the mind blower of glassblowers.

233
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,520
Yeah.

234
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,690
Good.
