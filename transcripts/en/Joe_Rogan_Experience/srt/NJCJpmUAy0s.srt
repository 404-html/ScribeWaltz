1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,700
Scott adams,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,900
here we are.
Hey Joe.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,820
Good to see you again man.
Good to see you again.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,010
Um,
I met you decades ago.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,200
Do you remember that?
Horrible story?

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,980
I don't remember a horrible story,
but it was on news radio was horrible

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,870
stories you remember about humiliation
that day.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,930
Know what happened.
So for those of you who weren't with us

9
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:25,590
on that set,
I had a small line,

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,730
just one line on news radio because it
was an episode that mentioned Dilbert.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,830
So I was invited as a guest and you were
giving the line before my line.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,490
So I just came in and they said,
joe is going to say this.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,530
Joe.
Say you're lying and you've turned to me

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,330
and you said you lied.
And they said,

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,270
when he says that you say your line.
And of course I panicked because I,

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,440
you know,
I don't do this right?

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,450
Not An actor.
So the scene starts and it's one of

18
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,850
these scenes that runs continuous from
beginning to end.

19
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,980
It's not like a movie where you cut it
every 10 seconds.

20
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,430
So you have to do a ride all the way
through and we get to my,

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,370
my line and you're turning the other
direction.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,540
So the line I'm waiting to hear instead
of hearing it clearly,

23
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,340
like in practice when you were facing
me,

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,340
I hear Walmart.
Oh No.

25
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,580
And I think to myself,
I don't know what his other lines are,

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,040
so I don't know if that sounds like my
line or is that,

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,080
should I go?
And I said to myself,

28
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,680
50 slash 50 chance
either.

29
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:26,220
Either ruin the scene by saying
something the wrong time or I ruined the

30
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:29,190
scene by being silent when I should've
been talking.

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,250
So I said I'm going to go with silent
and I just,

32
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,830
I just stood there in silence and
everybody,

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,300
everybody got really quiet.

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,460
I don't know if you remember why you
did.

35
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,830
But uh oh,
it's burned in my mind.

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,480
You were very nice that day,
but you just sort of slowly turned

37
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:50,040
around and looked at me and meanwhile
all the other actors sort of slowly

38
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,490
turned around and looked at me because
that was the source of the problem.

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,493
And then,
uh,

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,600
but I have to admit I was impressed
because that all the actors went back to

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,050
square one and did the entire scene
through again,

42
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,660
perfectly.
There is very impressive if you're not

43
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:11,661
an actor to watch how many lines a bunch
of professionals can do without screwing

44
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,020
up any of them.
It was,

45
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:13,440
it was,
uh,

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,430
it was an awesome kind of an afternoon.
Well,

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,570
news radio was a very unusual show in
that we did.

48
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,080
There was a lot of changing stuff on the
fly.

49
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,140
Like the writers come in and rewrite a
line,

50
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,840
like on the fly,
like they would do one line that we do

51
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,900
one take and then Paul Sams,
Josh Lieb on these guys would get

52
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,830
together and they go,
okay,

53
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,960
that's,
let's try this.

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,920
Let's try this,
we'll go back.

55
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,770
But then when he went,
Scott turns to you now to say this and

56
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,840
then we'd have a totally new line for
the next scene.

57
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,530
And so we'd have to like be standing
over there by the elevator going,

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,120
no,
that's not gonna work.

59
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,650
No,
that's not gonna work.

60
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:48,840
We do like come up with a bunch of
different ways to say it and then just

61
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:52,920
run with it on the fly and people don't
realize how hard that is.

62
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,150
Isn't that hard?
Honestly,

63
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,040
it's not coal mining.
What will you have to have the right

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,260
kind of mind for them?
Memory?

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,130
Yeah.
Sort of like when a musician

66
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,620
can do you know,
50 songs from memory.

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,520
Yeah,
and I'm thinking I could do seven notes,

68
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,530
you know,
and then I'm good.

69
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,440
That's all I can remember in a row and
after that it'd be just be guessing.

70
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,340
Well,
if you think about how many you just

71
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,300
think about language itself,
how many words you can access just

72
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,580
instantaneously.
Just pulled them up from your memory.

73
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,730
You know,
it's just that's what you do all the

74
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,520
time and if you all the time we're
reading sitcoms,

75
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,040
scripts,
you just get used to that sort of flow

76
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,480
and how things go.
It's not,

77
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,080
it's not really that everything looks
difficult if you don't know how to do

78
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,190
it.
Exactly.

79
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,500
Exactly.
People say that about my job as well as

80
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,750
how do you do that?
It's like,

81
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,160
well,
it happens to be the one thing I can do

82
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,161
well and I can't do most things well,
but one little thing I can do well.

83
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,000
Well,
one thing that people have a hard time

84
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,510
with the Sitcom world,
especially the old school sitcom world

85
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,010
is the audience like performing in front
of the audience.

86
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,870
This is a weird element,
you know,

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,860
I do feel that,
well,

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,900
you know,
I do tons of public speaking,

89
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,380
so in that environment I liked the
energy and I like all of it,

90
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:05,770
but usually if I'm speaking I know
exactly what I'm going to say and even

91
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,970
if I mess it up,
it doesn't matter.

92
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:10,300
It doesn't have to be specific,
but that was a,

93
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,550
that was a frightening situation
because.

94
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,990
So,
so keep in mind also that most of the

95
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,000
actors were stars,
you know,

96
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:21,010
there,
there were pretty big names and so I was

97
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,560
meeting everybody that.
So I was a little bit star struck and

98
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,510
you know,
I was completely out of my element and

99
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,160
that completely blew the scene.

100
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,150
You know,
just me.

101
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,990
It was like,
oh,

102
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,720
maybe there wasn't anybody else.
It was just me,

103
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,040
sounds like I fucked up.
Sounds like I was looking in the wrong

104
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,200
direction,
which is totally possible.

105
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,740
We were standing in line so you have to
be facing the way you were,

106
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,450
but.
Oh.

107
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,950
Oh.
So I was looking at you during the

108
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,720
rehearsal or something.
Yeah,

109
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,490
the setup was we were standing in line
to get coffee and so during the practice

110
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,580
you turned to me so you.
So I would know exactly what you were

111
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,830
saying,
but in the actual thing we were in line.

112
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,480
So you're talking to somebody else.
Right?

113
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,380
I get it.
I get it.

114
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,610
I get it.
Yeah,

115
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,080
man,
I don't remember that at all.

116
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,620
It's like it's so funny how like one
person can remember something and it's

117
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,000
like a big moment and then another
person go,

118
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,400
like,
I just erased that.

119
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,650
Well I knew that I met you and I
remember,

120
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,940
oh,
Scott Adams is cool.

121
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:13,660
I like that cartoon and then all of a
sudden it's over.

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,291
You know,
it was that.

123
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:14,920
It was,
you know,

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,030
there's no other memories in my database
at a totally different experience that

125
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,380
day.
Well,

126
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,540
it's also,
I did 100 of them or 98 or whatever the

127
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,640
hell we did.
So it's,

128
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,040
it's a weird thing as you get older too.
Like I,

129
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,450
there's memories that I just have
scrubbed.

130
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,190
I'm like,
no room for him.

131
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,230
I got new data coming in,
I got to make some space.

132
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,420
It's like cleaning out your garage,
you know,

133
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,960
so there's nothing scarier than getting
together with your siblings after you

134
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,200
haven't seen him for years and you start
talking about your childhood and one of

135
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,510
you will be telling the story like,
do you remember the time?

136
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,940
I know it doesn't matter what it is.
I,

137
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,360
I jumped on a zebra and I ran it across
the zoo and they read the Ltb and the

138
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,430
other sibling will say,
that wasn't you.

139
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,630
That was me.
I was the one on the zebra.

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,850
It'll be such like,
you know,

141
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,310
a memory

142
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,300
that you couldn't forget what you did.
You actually wrote yourself into a

143
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,260
scene.
You weren't even there.

144
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,650
You were watching and you,
you wrote yourself into the hero's

145
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,670
theme.
That does happen with people.

146
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,210
Human Memories really flawed.
It's really flawed.

147
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,610
Well,
if you want to go real deep real fast,

148
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,590
you just gave me the good opening.
Uh,

149
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,740
uh,
I am a proponent of the,

150
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:22,050
we are all a software simulation,
um,

151
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,100
view of reality and that would also
explain why memories are so screwed up

152
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,090
and the explanation would be that the
past doesn't exist until you need it.

153
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,020
In other words,
the past writes itself on demand because

154
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,260
if we're software you wouldn't have
everything in the universe preprogram

155
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,280
just in case you needed it.
It would take too much resources.

156
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,910
I might have to spark up a joint.
So you just want real deep,

157
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:47,650
real quick.

158
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,250
I was hoping I was hoping to go that
way.

159
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,740
Do you want some smoke?
The weed?

160
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,620
I could do it for the first time.
I'd be willing to try it once.

161
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,180
Well,
I don't know if I want to give it to you

162
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,740
for the first time and I want you to
freak out.

163
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,710
You don't smoke pot at all.
The truth is I smoked pot once ever was

164
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,810
in first day of college,
but I never stopped.

165
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,000
So that's really just once.
Oh,

166
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,040
I understand.
So you smoked pot all the time,

167
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,900
so he did it once and you just kept
going.

168
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,450
I'd be willing to try it a second time
is what I'm saying.

169
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,830
I understand what you're saying.

170
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,740
Sure,
sure.

171
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,980
What you like,
what has life been like for Scott Adams

172
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,520
during this election?
You,

173
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,020
um,
came into the,

174
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,200
well,
you're obviously always well known for

175
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,090
being a creator of Dilbert,
but

176
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm along selection cycle.
All of a sudden there was,

177
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,770
I had,
you know,

178
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,140
people that are already in contact with.
They were saying,

179
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:46,060
you know,
Scott Adams is a trump supporter.

180
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,590
And I was like,
what?

181
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,080
Scott Adams,
the Dilbert guys and trump supporter

182
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,290
because everyone assumes you meet
someone and they're a,

183
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,910
in the creative business,
you know,

184
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,120
you're in a creative business,
your,

185
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,010
you write a comic strip,
you would assume that you would be left

186
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,920
wing guy like almost,
almost immediately.

187
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,480
Well,
I'm neither left nor right.

188
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm sort of all over the place.
My,

189
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,830
my views didn't match,
you know,

190
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,520
either of the major candidates on
anything.

191
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,750
So you're a free thinker.
I like to think I'm right and everybody

192
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:20,120
else was wrong.
I would like that too.

193
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,760
I'm actually,
um,

194
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,270
my larger philosophical grounding is
that is informed by my experience as a

195
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,560
hypnotist.
I'm not sure if you knew that.

196
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,000
No,
I didn't know you're a hypnotist.

197
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,930
So in my twenties I went to hypnosis
school and became an actual train

198
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,060
certified hypnotist.
Wow.

199
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,770
Yeah.
One of the things you learn as a

200
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:44,540
hypnotist is that the world is backwards
to the way people normally perceive it.

201
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,630
So normally you see the world as,
Hey,

202
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:49,370
you know,
90 percent of the time people are

203
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:53,720
irrational and doing rational things,
but 10 percent of the time we just go

204
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:56,370
knots and we do stupid things and it's
because something happened.

205
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,203
This sparked,
right?

206
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,900
That's the normal view of the world.
The hypnotist view of the world is

207
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,720
opposite.
The hypnotist says that 90 percent of

208
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:07,710
the time we're a completely irrational
and we're just making rationalizations

209
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:11,340
for why we did things after the fact.
Ten percent of the time we're rational.

210
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,030
But that's only when there's no
emotional content to the decision.

211
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,470
You know,
you're balancing a checkbook or

212
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:17,101
something,
you know,

213
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,120
trying to pick a,
you know,

214
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:21,170
the best route to someplace.
Um,

215
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,420
so that's how I see the world.
And so when I look at either the trump

216
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:28,980
supporters or the Clinton supporters,
to me from the hypnotist perspective and

217
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:31,530
someone who's studied persuasion for
decades,

218
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,500
I used it in my writing.
Um,

219
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,360
I see both sides as completely
ridiculous both and both of them are

220
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,690
grounded in complete absurdity is
they're just different.

221
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,510
Yeah.
But nobody knows why they're deciding

222
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,520
the real reasons that people make
decisions.

223
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,320
Our fear identity,
um,

224
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,700
you know,
they have some aspiration,

225
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,620
they've got something they're trying to
solve.

226
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:56,820
There's something that they're trying to
work out,

227
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,460
but the reasons we give are usually
completely false.

228
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,880
And the grounding for this
is that if you think about evolution,

229
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,820
I assume you believe we evolved.
Yes.

230
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,200
Um,
there was no requirement in evolution

231
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,920
that we ever understand our environment
the way we imagined we do.

232
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,560
And here's an example of that.
You could believe that you are a monk.

233
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,340
You know you're reincarnated from the
10th century monk like Steven Seagal.

234
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,750
It does.
He believe that,

235
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,300
yeah,
he's like a Buddha or something from an

236
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:33,000
actual,
like he actually got it bestowed upon

237
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,580
him by some Tibetan character.
All right,

238
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:39,600
so let's use Steven Seagal.
So Steven Seagal can be standing in a

239
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,690
grocery store next to,
let's say a Muslim who believes that his

240
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,170
profit literally flew to heaven on a
winged horse.

241
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,630
Those two people don't live the same
reality,

242
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,390
but they both buy groceries.
They both go,

243
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,950
they cook it,
they live,

244
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,030
they survive.
So it turns out that understanding your

245
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,000
reality at an actual,
you know,

246
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,590
I really know what is objectively
happening and I get it and I've got a

247
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:04,920
mental model that's quite accurate.
We don't need any of that.

248
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,200
So it would be deeply unlikely that we
evolved such a specific skill that's

249
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,570
completely unnecessary as far as we can
tell.

250
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,400
You know,
we do need to know that if I,

251
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,250
if you run into this wall,
you know your head is going to hurt.

252
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,400
So there's some basic stuff,
but we're probably all in even

253
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,230
interpreting that experience
differently.

254
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,840
So there's no reason to think that the
way I think of it as the way you think

255
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,750
of it.
So I see the world is this big

256
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:32,751
irrational ball and I use the hypnotist
persuaders skills to back up and try to

257
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:35,214
deduce,
you know,

258
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,780
what's really driving things.

259
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,140
And when people said that was a trump
supporter,

260
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,350
what they meant was,
um,

261
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,940
they may have only seen part of what I
was talking about.

262
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,430
I was writing about his skill as a
persuader.

263
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,350
And what I mean is that I noticed in him
the skills that I've over decades for

264
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,060
persuasion,
but I had a higher level than I've ever

265
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:02,050
seen.
Meaning that he is the most persuasive

266
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,500
living human I've ever experienced.
And I mean that in terms of actual

267
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,340
technique.
You know,

268
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:11,230
he's,
he's full of technique and it's all the

269
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,780
time.
I'll give you,

270
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,570
give you some examples.
That first time I noticed it was the

271
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,600
very first debate when Megan Kelly was
asking him the question about the

272
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,530
insults he had allegedly said to women,
not allegedly.

273
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:28,930
You said them.
And this is a setup that any other

274
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:33,460
politician with this setup is totally
trapped because they can either try to

275
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,740
deny,
they set it and then somebody has a

276
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:37,240
videotape and that doesn't work.

277
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,250
Or they can say,
oh,

278
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,500
I didn't mean it.
There's almost nothing you can say.

279
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,230
You're just trapped.
And that would've been the end of his

280
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,390
campaign.
First debate should have been over.

281
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,730
And if you remember,
do you remember what he said?

282
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,593
No,
I don't.

283
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,140
She said,
you said this,

284
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:53,710
this and this about women.
And he smiled.

285
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,740
He sort of looked at the audience and it
looked like or the camera.

286
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,000
And he said only Rosie O'donnell and the
audience erupted in laughter.

287
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,020
Completely unexpected and a place
inappropriate.

288
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,340
Provocative.
And what I noticed was that Rosie

289
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,850
O'donnell is a,
is a visual image that everybody shares,

290
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,250
right?
You've got a picture of her soon,

291
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:18,040
as I say the name and for his base that
he was catering to.

292
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,870
It was an unpopular image and one that
would just suck all the energy away from

293
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,790
the question which was toxic.

294
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,130
And really,
you know,

295
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,530
you can't touch the question.
You just have to suck all the energy

296
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:32,410
into another part of the room and wait
for the time to run out.

297
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,100
And that's what he did and it became the
headline,

298
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,641
Blah,
blah blah.

299
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:36,474
And He,
you know,

300
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,520
uh,
certainly,

301
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,070
uh,
highlighted the things he said about

302
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:42,820
women maybe more than it would have,
but the way he escaped that got my

303
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,460
attention and I thought that doesn't
look normal,

304
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,573
right?
That,

305
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,180
that's a,
that's operating at another level.

306
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,160
And so I looked for more examples of it
and you can see it everywhere and it was

307
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,440
especially clear by the time you started
saying,

308
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,830
well,
the other visual things he does is he

309
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,490
says,
build a wall and you can just imagine a

310
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,650
wall when he says,
uh,

311
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,060
we're,
we're paying too much ransom to Iran for

312
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,080
those soldiers.

313
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,150
He says,
we paid $400,

314
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,200
million,
or whatever the number is.

315
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,420
He goes,
imagine that money piled up.

316
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,240
It'd be so much money you would fill
this room.

317
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,170
You can't even imagine that big pile of
money.

318
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,770
He always goes to the visual because we
know that the visual part of our

319
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:24,940
brayden's the dominant part.
If you can get its attention and get it

320
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:27,580
on your message,
it talks to the rest of your brain into

321
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:29,520
anything you want it to.
Um,

322
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,590
when he talks about Isis,
he goes visual also.

323
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,100
He doesn't say they are bad people who's
religions has been distorted to the type

324
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:40,390
of thing you might hear from Hillary
Clinton.

325
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,280
He says they put you in cages and they
trained you in the cage.

326
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,930
They chop your head off.
I mean you can see that you're playing

327
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,890
in your head.
So everything he does,

328
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,760
he gets more attention than everything
everybody else does because he puts it

329
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,110
into a provocative picture.

330
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,740
So that was the first thing I noticed.
Then when he got to Jeb Bush and he

331
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,480
needed to defeat Jeb because he was the
strongest competitor.

332
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,340
So if he couldn't get past two of them,
there was no point.

333
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,060
And he went after him and strong and he
went after him fast and he went after

334
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:15,770
him with a low energy kill shot.
That's why I call these linguistic kill

335
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:18,140
shots.
It's not just an insult.

336
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,280
It was not just a clever nickname.
And we saw Clinton tried to come up with

337
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:25,550
clever nicknames that had no,
no purchase whatsoever,

338
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,020
like dangerous Donald,
you know,

339
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:29,450
it just didn't work.
But look at the.

340
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,700
Look at low Energy Jeb.
Here's how it's engineered.

341
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,710
It's engineered for confirmation bias,
meaning that you want the future to make

342
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,410
this look like a better nickname every
day.

343
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,480
And you want it to match his
physicality.

344
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,020
So before I ever heard low energy Jeb,
I had a good impression of Jeb Bush.

345
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,210
W,
when you look at Jeb Bush,

346
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,410
didn't you say to yourself,
this guy,

347
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,490
it looks like a cool character,
like if no,

348
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,870
but he looked like he was an incontrol.
I'm calm,

349
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,860
reasonable.
Exactly the person you'd want if that.

350
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:07,610
If the nuclear question came up,
if there was some big decision Jeb Bush

351
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:11,740
isn't going to get excited about.
Seemed like a competent CEO competency.

352
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:12,620
Yeah,
exactly.

353
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,580
And as soon as trump said low energy,
could you see him?

354
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:20,420
And the other way he was low energy,
low energy,

355
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:22,220
lying ted,
lying ted.

356
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,000
Lying Ted was beautiful because you knew
that because he's a politician,

357
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,670
sometime in the next several months he's
going to say stuff that you can say is a

358
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:32,170
lie,
whether it is or not,

359
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,250
just it doesn't have to,
but more importantly a ted has a

360
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,650
physicality about him that unfortunately
he's got beady eyes and I've said this

361
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:43,940
before,
if you're going to cast a movie,

362
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,790
you know,
we need a guy who's looks dishonest.

363
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,200
It would be his face and unfortunately,
I mean,

364
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,720
I don't know if he's actually dishonest.
I'm not going to make a judgment.

365
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,490
So came up with the Zodiac killer thing.
Was that a trump fan or was it trump

366
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:02,780
himself that started saying that Ted was
the Zodiac killer.

367
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,260
I think that probably started with the
fan,

368
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,960
but.
So the other thing that was fucking

369
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,760
harsh man,
he be given speeches.

370
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,010
Are you the Zodiac killer?
People would scream it out like you

371
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,770
imagine having to deal with that.
And did your father killed somebody?

372
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,270
Yeah,
yeah,

373
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,040
yeah.
His father was maybe dad was the Zodiac

374
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,030
killer.
Is that with the Zodiac killer?

375
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,320
It was like the seventies,
right?

376
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,530
Might not be old enough.
Uh,

377
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,280
so crooked Hillary,
Crooked Hillary,

378
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:33,230
same thing,
circle millions of brilliant one.

379
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,480
So she wasn't physically,
you know,

380
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:40,070
as limber as a young person.
So you could imagine her sort of a

381
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:43,250
little bit crooked physically,
and you knew that there would be stories

382
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:45,800
coming out in which people could say,
well,

383
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,020
there's another example of that
crookedness did you see?

384
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,890
But you thought that that a physical
sense,

385
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:50,010
like

386
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,290
the way she looked all I thought about
his corruption,

387
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,670
I heard Crooked Hillary.
I saw her like with like a burglar's

388
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,740
mask on trying to sneak away with bags
that had dollar signs on them.

389
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,090
You know,
that's what I saw.

390
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,070
If you look at anyone of these
individually,

391
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,960
his nickname's you,
you could say,

392
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,050
well,
it's sort of random.

393
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,840
He just got lucky.
But if you look at a ball,

394
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,300
they all have that physicality.
They all have the,

395
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,640
uh,
the priming so that,

396
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,190
you know,
you'll confirmation bias will kick in.

397
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,450
Whatever you see.
After that,

398
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,940
we'll just fit the label because it's
the first thing you think,

399
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,170
well,
he's a performer.

400
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,181
You know,
you,

401
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,690
you,
you can say Donald Trump is a

402
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,280
businessman.
He most certainly is.

403
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,660
It certainly is a real estate investor,
but he's been a public figure for

404
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:31,740
decades and when you're a public figure,
you're a performer and he's performing

405
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:35,370
all the time and he's also,
he likes to win.

406
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,370
And so when he's engaging in people,
he makes it personal.

407
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:40,860
So he's gotten very good at what's
called playing the dozens,

408
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,470
you know,
playing the dozens is tell us it's a

409
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:44,670
insult thing,
you know,

410
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:48,780
like you can like one guy like guys in
the hood,

411
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,190
in the inner cities,
this started out as a black term,

412
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,880
but it's essentially like a version of
your mama contest.

413
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,580
Like some guys are way better at your
mama jokes.

414
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,180
They're way better at playing the
dozens.

415
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,020
They're way better at shitting on other
people around them.

416
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,490
And it's for the entertainment of each
other.

417
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,480
So huge thing amongst comedians.
We shit on each other constantly left

418
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,940
and right,
but it's generally encouraged and we all

419
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:12,850
enjoy it,
you know,

420
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,650
but when a guy has decades and decades
and decades of this like Donald Trump,

421
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:21,690
but a very high level because he's known
to be a billionaire investor who puts

422
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,880
his name on everything,
everything and still win big,

423
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,120
which I talk about developing systems
for succeeding.

424
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,670
One of the systems is to you do this to
a stack together,

425
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,900
what I would call ordinary skills until
your stack is different than anybody

426
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:38,430
else's.
So in my case,

427
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,200
I'm not a great artist.
I didn't take any writing courses,

428
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,130
but I'm pretty good at drawing and I'm
pretty good at writing a little bit of

429
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:50,090
funny so it put them together and I
couldn't do a comic strip because it's

430
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,820
rare that you get somebody who's,
let's say in the top 10 percent of three

431
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:56,280
different things,
but it's not hard to be in the top 10

432
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:58,350
percent of things if you're.
If you're going after them.

433
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,620
So if you look at trump,
he wrote a book on negotiating.

434
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,830
So he knows business.
He knows negotiating.

435
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:07,320
He knows public speaking,
he has a sense of humor,

436
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,380
a really good one.
He's quick on his feet now.

437
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:13,410
He knows politics from both the inside
and the outside.

438
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,180
Um,
he knows twitter.

439
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,120
If you,
you know,

440
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,190
I could probably go on and you would say
if you looked at any one of those

441
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:22,710
things,
he's not the best you've ever seen.

442
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,540
You know,
he's not the best public speaker,

443
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,860
the funniest person,
etc. But there aren't many people who

444
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,650
can do all of those things in the top 10
percent.

445
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,100
You put it as a puBlic speaker.
I don't think he's nearly in the top 10

446
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,970
percent.
I think he's a,

447
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,100
I mean,
I'm just being honest.

448
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,920
I think he has a very poor efficiency
of,

449
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,020
of words like,
um,

450
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,770
he uses,
he repeats himself when it's not really

451
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,360
important.
And when it repeats itself,

452
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,720
what I usually see is like someone's
searching for the next thing to say,

453
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,160
you know what I'm saying?
Like he'll say,

454
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,810
you know,
I'm gonna,

455
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,550
be honest with you.
I'm going to be honest with you.

456
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,050
Okay,
I'm going to be honest with you here.

457
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,870
He'll do that in a way that is not.
It's not efficient,

458
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,030
not efficient,
but it's persuasive in this way

459
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,710
sometimes,
but it also.

460
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,530
No repetition,
repetition sometimes.

461
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,870
Sometimes,
and sometimes it's clunky.

462
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,870
Yeah.
I feel like he.

463
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,460
I feel like there's a lot of times where
it's his style to do that and he's done

464
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:22,750
it before,
but even like in delivering lines,

465
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,620
you've got to know when to not talk.
Like here's a perfect example.

466
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,280
When he said that he called the
president of the president of Mexico up

467
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,080
and they had the conversation about the
wall and he said,

468
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,150
the wall just got 10 foot higher.
He's like,

469
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:35,110
yeah,
that's what I said.

470
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,630
That is what I said.
Like he repeats that said he should've

471
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,180
just let it hang.
He should have just said the wall just

472
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:40,930
got 10 foot high.

473
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,770
They would've went crazy and you gotta
walk back and forth and just sucked it

474
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,090
in.
But he kept talking.

475
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,480
So that's not the best speaker like
obama.

476
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:53,710
I feels way better public speaker,
way more efficient with his words,

477
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,190
way better control of the sentences that
he speaks,

478
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,260
but it's more professional.
I think you're judging a standard that I

479
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:04,900
probably wouldn't use,
so I took the dale carnegie course

480
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,430
teaching you how to be a public speaker
and their course taught you a zero

481
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:10,620
technique.
It was,

482
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,020
it was a course on public speaking in
which theY tell you nothing about

483
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:15,850
technique.
The things that you're saying he's

484
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,920
doing,
not necessarily technique.

485
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,150
Well,
let me just finish this off shore.

486
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:21,130
I'm sorry.
What they tell you is just confidence

487
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,400
and,
and if you were happy and confident,

488
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,920
you would almost always do well even if
you make a mistake,

489
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:27,754
you correct.

490
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,960
so he strikes me as the confident dale
carnegie type of speaker,

491
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,220
the person who's selling an emotion.
It's an experience.

492
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,350
You're not going there really to get
information.

493
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,710
It's not really a well crafted joke
she'll looking for.

494
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,710
You're going there to feel something and
you can't.

495
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,510
You can't deny that 30,000 people in a
stadium with red hats on know they were

496
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:53,110
feeling something.
So in terms of delivering and emotion,

497
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,510
top 10 percent.
Hmm.

498
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,920
Interesting.
Well,

499
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:01,921
I think that for absolutely one thing
you could say is he knows how to do the

500
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:06,790
Donald Trump thing and the Donald Trump
thing is very different than the rest of

501
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,910
the politicians thing.
The Donald Trump thing is not humble.

502
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,800
The Donald Trump thing will tell you
about his past successes and use them to

503
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,600
tell you how he's going to be successful
in the future.

504
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,350
The Donald Trump thing when confronted
with certain things like the thing about

505
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,610
it,
you know him saying something about

506
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,900
hillary,
lacking stamina,

507
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,270
and then you start goes off about having
a winning temperament.

508
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,090
I have a winning temperament.
There's not a lot of people who could do

509
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:33,091
that in that sort of a political forum.
Like if if say mitt romney was running

510
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:34,990
for president,
he started saying,

511
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,410
I have a winning temperament.
I.

512
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,120
They'd be like,
oh,

513
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,010
ms dot gone fucking crazy.
Right?

514
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,880
You remember how howard dean got knocked
out of the race just for screaming.

515
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,290
He just screamed at a rally and it was
over.

516
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,070
The wind came out

517
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,030
of the balloon,
but you know,

518
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,600
you know what howard dean did wrong.
What you always screamed once,

519
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,150
it's all,
it's all about contrast.

520
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,710
Well,
he also didn't make fun of it,

521
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,030
you know,
he should have come on and he should

522
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:59,900
have done something to make fun of it.
He should've had a speech where he

523
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,090
talked about.
So I got a little carried away folks,

524
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,290
you know,
like he,

525
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,490
he,
he hid from it.

526
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,440
It feels like he could have fixed that.
Yes.

527
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,300
Yeah,
I had that at the time.

528
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,300
Well,
if the problem was it was contrary to

529
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:14,300
what he was selling,
he was selling this buttoned up,

530
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,100
packaged deal and in the middle of that
package deal is a fucking pro wrestling

531
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:21,310
fans screaming from a suplex,
you know,

532
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,120
like hulk hogan suplexes the iron sheik.
And I mean that's what it was like.

533
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,110
I mean,
that's not the guy who,

534
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:28,400
you want to have the button.

535
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,140
So have you heard of these studies?
I think this has been replicated in

536
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,910
fairly reliable that if you want to
addict somebody to something,

537
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,590
let's say this year,
your show,

538
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,640
if you gave them a really good product
every time,

539
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,140
it actually wouldn't be as addictive as
if once in a while it wasn't good and

540
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,000
they had to sort of like wait and
anticipate,

541
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,560
oh,
there's that good weather again.

542
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,930
So a unpredIctable rewards are far more
addicting than predictable.

543
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,580
So a hillary clinton who reward you
every time and it,

544
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,180
but it's just about the same is not
gonna be nearly as addicting as Donald

545
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,220
Trump.
Who disappoints the fuck out of you?

546
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,270
You're like,
god,

547
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:10,290
I was just starting to like you.
Why did you say that that way?

548
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,380
And then two weeks later he comes out
with something.

549
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:14,340
You say,
shit,

550
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:15,870
I love you again.
And you know,

551
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:18,570
so it's,
he's got that addictive pattern going.

552
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,170
Well I'll tell you what,
once all that grab the pussy stuff got

553
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:24,110
out of the way.
He was doIng a lot of speeches and the

554
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:28,060
rundown the last few days and I watched
a few of them on television because I

555
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,120
almost felt like even though I knew I
was gonna vote,

556
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,260
I almost felt like some sort of a
spectator like this is this cannot

557
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:39,200
possibly be real to speak to your
software simulation idea in the

558
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,760
beginning that a lot of people share,
by the way,

559
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,960
it's not just crazy Scott Adams and me,
but there's a lot of folks out there

560
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,580
that think that we're living in a
simulation.

561
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:49,490
Right.
But as he would give these speeches,

562
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:53,070
and there were some of his speeches he
gave where there was these moments where

563
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,730
you're like,
if someone could tell that guy to keep

564
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:58,880
it at seven,
like where he's at right there and talk

565
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:01,760
like that always and avoid all the crazy
shit.

566
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,360
But man,
the crazy shit is what you get.

567
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,870
Like that's.
That's the thing about people like trump

568
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,230
or like any powerful super dominator
type character like that.

569
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,570
You'd have some flaws.
A lot of them,

570
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,180
the liquid,

571
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,030
he kept saying all the time,
he was always saying he was the energy

572
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:21,800
guy.
Yesterday.

573
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,270
I look at my crowds.
The other one has no stamina.

574
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:25,104
This one's,
you know,

575
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,410
low energy.
Um,

576
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,870
he knew the facts didn't matter,
he knew the policy didn't matter.

577
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,330
And by the end,
I think everybody agrees they didn't

578
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,700
mean by,
by election day.

579
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,580
Not a lot of people were saying,
well,

580
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,530
I sure like that tpp stand,
nothing like that was happening.

581
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:43,364
There was no,

582
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,400
no issues.
It just,

583
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:47,610
it just came down to which one you
hated.

584
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,420
The more.
Well,

585
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,500
there was one issue though that was real
and that was amongst feminists,

586
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,730
there was amongst women who were willing
to exonerate hillary on all the weird

587
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,470
shit that she had ever done involving
women.

588
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,420
Uh,
all the stuff that she had done

589
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:03,490
involving deleted emails and,
you know,

590
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,950
and I had heard people even say that
people were giving her a hard time

591
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,490
because she's a woman on her health and
I was like,

592
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:15,690
you are out of your fucking mind if you
believe that she's falling asleep when

593
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,940
she standing up.
That is bad.

594
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,180
That is so bad.
If that was anyone close to me,

595
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,800
anyone close to me,
I'd be like,

596
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,110
you're not going to be president.
We got to get you healthy.

597
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,920
You're fuckIng blacking out while you're
standing up and it's not just.

598
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Once she fell down once in 2012,
got a serious concussion and was fucked

599
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,740
up for six months.
Me as a person who's terrified of brain

600
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,510
trauma,
that freaks me the fuck out because I

601
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:44,130
know the repercussions of brain trauma.
I know the impulsiveness that it bestows

602
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,800
upon people.
It's a horrible curse that happens.

603
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,940
It's happened to a lot of people I know,
so I knew there was this weird

604
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:53,700
delusional thing where people didn't
want to address the fact that our health

605
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:57,570
is poor and then it was revealed that
one of the wikileaks emails that she had

606
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:00,450
suffered from some sort of a,
not a stroke,

607
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:05,451
but a seizure in 2015 like that's a
fucking year ago what is happening,

608
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,700
but nobody wanted to talk about that and
there was this strange air that she's

609
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:13,230
not being treated fairly.
I'm like,

610
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,260
here's treated fairly.
She is a person who deleted 30,000

611
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,090
emails after she got a subpoena.

612
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,330
She's an older rich white woman.
If she was a 40 year old black guy and

613
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,370
she deleted 30,000 emails after
subpoena,

614
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:31,990
they would just shoot you.
It would just come over here.

615
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,000
They would kick down your fucking door
and cuff you and drag you off to a cage

616
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:39,260
somewhere.
So how weird is.

617
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,980
Am I right way here?
What's going on here?

618
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,870
How weird is it that we went through the
entire election cycle and so many people

619
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,050
like it wouldn't like,
like me were saying,

620
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:53,070
I'm not sure she looks healthy enough.
She's definitely not healthy now.

621
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,040
She of course metal the standards,
best presidents,

622
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,030
but what to what person ever interviewed
her and said,

623
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,650
look,
there are a lot of questions about your

624
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:05,370
health and so the question this way,
can you look the american public in the

625
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:09,240
eye and tell us there's no major health
problems that you haven't disclosed?

626
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,850
I would never ask her a question like
that because I don't think she'd ever

627
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:14,940
give you a real answer the same way with
the fbi,

628
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,330
but you could tell by the way she evaded
it whether she was.

629
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,270
She's a wizard at that though.
That's her shit.

630
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,300
That's the shit man.
That red cape with the bull just goes

631
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:25,860
flying by.
wow.

632
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,850
You could always tell a lie or light.
Layers will say something like,

633
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,190
so if so if you said to me,
scott,

634
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,580
have you ever had any major health
problems?

635
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,200
I'd say,
I haven't met all the requirements of

636
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:38,360
the presidency.
I was like,

637
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,090
oh no,
no.

638
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,460
I'm asking you a specific question.
Is there not disclosed?

639
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,360
And then I say,
Donald Trump hasn't disclosed any more

640
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:49,030
than I've disclosed.
That's a person who's hiding something.

641
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,310
right?
Otherwise they look you right in the eye

642
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,680
and they go,
I swear I'm great.

643
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,090
You know,
everything's good.

644
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,390
I promise you nothing's going to come
out lAter when I'm president.

645
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,410
You will not be disappointed in any way
because nobody can say that if they

646
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,690
think they're going to get bitten in the
ass in a year and a half when they

647
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:07,240
collapsed in the white house lawn.
My,

648
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,940
my point was insane.
that is that if you,

649
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,490
if you anyway described her health
issues,

650
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,510
that you would somehow be a sexist and
that the idea of her gender and being

651
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:19,690
the first female president,
which obviously would be very historic,

652
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,620
right?
Huge issue.

653
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,410
Huge,
huge honor that,

654
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,620
that,
that was a part of what they were votIng

655
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,030
for.
It became a part.

656
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:30,550
Her gender became a part of what they
were voting for.

657
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,890
And so that was an issue.
Let me give you the,

658
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,720
the,
the positive spin on the same topic.

659
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:43,350
Cnn polished 24,
a pundit explanations of why trump won

660
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,040
unexpectedly.

661
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,040
Twenty four different theories about why
we didn't see coming in the top 24.

662
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,020
None of them were.
she's a woman,

663
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:55,310
so couldn't get,
couldn't get it.

664
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,150
Not in the top 24.
Right?

665
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,030
So if we may pause for a moment from
piling on.

666
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,930
Ms dot clinton.
I got to say that the whole breaking the

667
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,790
glass ceiling thing,
she fucking did that.

668
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,010
That's toast.
There's no six year old born today who

669
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:15,250
says women can't be president.
That's not even in their worldview.

670
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,140
That's not true.
I'll find you five,

671
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,580
six year olds and say it right to your
face.

672
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:20,200
I'll bet not.
I get a bunch of them together.

673
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,180
Can a to be president.
I get some boys together.

674
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,390
I give them candy high five them.
You can trick them.

675
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,950
That's true.
You can talk.

676
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,370
Talk buys into anything for candy.
I mean,

677
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:31,204
I know what you're saying though.

678
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,000
I know what you're saying.
That she got as she won the popular

679
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:34,700
vote,
right?

680
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,310
As far as current count.
Right?

681
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,930
But who are you seeing saying,
oh,

682
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:41,260
if it was sexism that didn't get her
elected feminists,

683
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,520
feminists,
that I know.

684
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,620
I mean there's a lot of people that
actually believe that.

685
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,830
And you know what man,
there's a whole spectrum of variables

686
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:51,400
and if someone's thinking about if
they're hovering over a,

687
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,860
you know,
if they're looking at Gary Johnson and

688
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:54,790
hillary clinton,
maybe that was.

689
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,980
Maybe they'll never trump.
Maybe they're one of those people,

690
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:57,450
they're like,
one,

691
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,110
one of these motherfuckers going to get
my vote.

692
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,820
They might start thinking,
man,

693
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:02,140
I don't know if I want a woman
president.

694
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,120
That's absolutely a factor.
Have you heard anybody say that?

695
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:06,040
Yes.
Yes.

696
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,080
And what dId they say?
Did they friend of mine?

697
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,600
A yoga instructor?
So as a woman,

698
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,860
she was,
bitches are crazy.

699
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,420
I don't want a woman running this
country.

700
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,390
That's for real.
That's a real statement.

701
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,290
I mean that's a human being who was just
talking to me and we're friends and no

702
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,260
one was around.
And do you think that she would vote on

703
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:24,094
that?
Yes.

704
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,530
I think there's many people that would
vote on that,

705
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,750
but there's many people that will like,
fuck this man.

706
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:31,150
I don't care what hillary did.
I don't care if hillary's got a bunch of

707
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,580
rape victims buried in her backyard.
That's a woman.

708
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:36,790
She represents women and probably
donald's got more.

709
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,740
You know,
there's that attitude too.

710
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:42,320
There's a of people that would only vote
for a woman if given the chance.

711
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,470
Other know how you'd net it down because
I think it was a net positive.

712
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,670
Three hundred million people in this
country plus mexicans.

713
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,040
I don't think you really can net it down
like that.

714
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,070
I just think there's too many of us.
I don't think.

715
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,380
I think that's one of the things that we
learned from this really important

716
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,220
lesson when it comes to polls,
they're not real anymore.

717
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,560
They're not real.
You're not talking to me.

718
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:04,760
You're not.
You're not answering polls.

719
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:06,810
Jamie doesn't answer a goddamn pole.
Look at them.

720
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,360
So no one,
no one,

721
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,620
you know,
answers poles.

722
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,120
It's a such a small sampling of people
and the people that answer polls,

723
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,090
they don't have anything better to do
than answer a fucking pole.

724
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,850
Right?
That's not good as the jury duty

725
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:21,830
product.
That's exactLy what the problem is.

726
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,630
So I think we learned that definitively.
These polls do not work well.

727
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,870
If I could defend a native silver for a
moment was okay.

728
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,380
Again,
he does 5:38 to a website.

729
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:37,550
The best best statistician on politics.
What's not his fault?

730
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,650
He's worked with the data he has.
Well,

731
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,980
but he was also within two percent I
think wasn't.

732
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,930
yeah.
So yeah,

733
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,150
so at the end,
but you know,

734
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:46,070
they,
they always converge toward the end,

735
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,890
you know,
they started out wIldly ridiculous and

736
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:51,350
then when it's clear that it's going to
be one way or the other,

737
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:53,690
all the polls are coming toward the end
because they want to say,

738
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:54,210
well,
if they hadn't,

739
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,420
that was only two percent.
Well jamie and I were watching this

740
00:33:56,421 --> 00:34:00,200
video clip of the young turks calling
down the election yesterday and at the

741
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:04,040
beginning of it they were 100 percent
convinced that hillary could not lose.

742
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,720
You know,
there's this one guy was saying,

743
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:07,430
you know,
hillary can't lose.

744
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,880
She like literally it's mathematically
and then by the end they were fucking

745
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,650
screaming and swearing.
It was like,

746
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,280
wow,
these numbers that people like count on

747
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,830
like 84 percent say this 15 percent.

748
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,940
Try to Imagine my life.
I don't know if you know this,

749
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:25,580
but a year ago,
more than a year ago,

750
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,910
I predicted that trump would win with 98
percent certainty in a landslide win at

751
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:34,010
all.
I was one of the few people who said it

752
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,590
earlier,
and this is because of the way he was so

753
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:37,350
persuasive.
Yeah.

754
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,140
Just based on his,
his talents.

755
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,180
Not.
But this was pre the rosie o'donnell

756
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,220
thing.
If it was a year ago,

757
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,750
I think it was over the summer.
That was like august last year,

758
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,060
the first debates where I think yOu're
right,

759
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,680
but that wasn't a year ago,
right?

760
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,700
There was a little bit more than a year
ago,

761
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:53,990
but whatever.
We're splitting harrison.

762
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,420
Okay.
Um,

763
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,380
so back then when I predicted it,
uh,

764
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,200
you can imagine the heat I took because
it was such an unlikely pick and how

765
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:08,201
many people just wanting to dance on my
grave for be enrolling and the angry at

766
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:09,920
you and angry.
Yes.

767
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,330
Going to be going over to amazon and get
me a bad book reviews because they

768
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:15,740
didn't like what I said about Donald
Trump.

769
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,900
So that moment when I found out that I
haven't wasted my whole year because it

770
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:27,920
would have been a terrible year to be so
wrong for a year,

771
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,010
and then there's like no pay off
whatsoever.

772
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,020
It was like,
it was like the worst gamble ever.

773
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,150
Bad risk management.
Um,

774
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,010
but then to have it come,
come through just the way

775
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,880
I predicted it was this amazing,
amazing moment.

776
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:43,410
You only get a few of those in your
life.

777
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,960
Well,
he did really lend win by a landslide.

778
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,910
So that you were off by that.
That's an electoral landslide.

779
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,860
Oh,
electoral.

780
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,720
Yeah,
I guess so.

781
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,010
Electorally one by quite a few points.
Right?

782
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,970
But it wasn't.
It was pretty close up until how many

783
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:59,670
hours in,
as soon as you started,

784
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,990
it doesn't,
doesn't matter.

785
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:01,923
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.

786
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,120
It doesn't matter.
Here's the thing that I think it's

787
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,120
important to make a distinction,
and this is what I recognize.

788
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:10,810
I knew when I watched some of your
periscopes and when you just weren't

789
00:36:10,811 --> 00:36:13,780
making a moral judgment of him as a
person,

790
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:17,650
and that's what people expected.
People expected a line in the sand to be

791
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:21,760
drawn morally.
What you were doing was talking about

792
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,450
all of his traits,
you compounding all of his positive

793
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:30,451
traits and what he what he does well and
then people got mad at you for bringing

794
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,970
your.
You're analyzing it like say if you're a

795
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:37,350
scientist and you take up a plant that
you find in the amazon,

796
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,721
you're like,
well,

797
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:40,180
what is this plant consists of?
What's break down the parts?

798
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,230
You were kind of breaking down the parts
of what he does and where what is

799
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:46,630
effective and it didn't seem to me.

800
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,420
Now I'm like,
this doesn't seem like a guy who was

801
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:48,730
like,
oh,

802
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,630
there's a few guys out there that are
like rabid rah rah trump supporters and

803
00:36:52,631 --> 00:36:56,140
some of them were at super transparent.
There's a few guys out there that I'm

804
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:57,850
watching them and I know what they're
doing.

805
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,280
What they're doing is they're latching
onto the trump train,

806
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,570
the latching on like really shamelessly
where they try.

807
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,480
They tweet about trump all the time now
where they never give a fuck about him.

808
00:37:07,481 --> 00:37:09,970
Awhile ago,
like over the last six months,

809
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:12,640
they've jumped on this because they
recognize there's a tremendous amount of

810
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:16,750
loyalty and momentum behind being a
trump supporter and a fan because it's a

811
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,320
tough stance to take.
So guys that are already marginalized or

812
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,710
already kind of like fringe and people
think they're kinda maybe creepy.

813
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,581
They're like,
fuck this,

814
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:27,550
I'm going to full cream and they jump
right in and it's kinda,

815
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,260
it's real transparent.
Interesting.

816
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,240
You know,
obviously that's just my take on it.

817
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:34,660
They might actually be really trump
supporters and they're super excited,

818
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:37,540
but I sent some disingenuous behavior
out there.

819
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,240
Careful,
careful trump train.

820
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,850
He might have some hobos on your fucking
wagons.

821
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,250
I think what's different about this
election and about trump in particular

822
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,830
is that it used to be we're electing a
leader,

823
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,350
someone who would be a role model and
all that.

824
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,310
I think he threw that all out the door
and social media throws even moral

825
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:00,700
authority.
What I mean is I think the public is the

826
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:02,080
leader knew.
I mean,

827
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:05,710
I think no laws get passed that less
than majority of the public wants it to

828
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:08,170
get past anything that gets a little
adeline.

829
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,150
Social media just throws it back in
line.

830
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,190
And more than ever I think we hired an
employee rather than a leader.

831
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,830
I feel like I hired a plumber,
you know,

832
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,130
someone who's just really good at a
specific set of skills,

833
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,900
negotiating,
you know,

834
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,040
maybe doing something with a budget,
whatever it needs to be done,

835
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,170
secure the borders.
But it's sort of like picking a lawyer.

836
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,170
I don't care what he's doing in his
personal life.

837
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,630
He's not my role model.
And by the way,

838
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,070
which of our kids are looking to 70 year
old men as their role models anyway.

839
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:40,660
I mean,
I don't know if that happens a lot

840
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:43,810
anyway,
but I think I think he really is going

841
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:48,811
to be the first sort of people's
president you see as policies changing

842
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:52,030
in real time.
And the example we talked about earlier

843
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,590
when,
um,

844
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,640
you know,
he had,

845
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,450
he misspoke and he said women should be
punished if they get an illegal

846
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,820
abortion.
It turns out that the law and both

847
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,690
republicans and democrats think that's
crazy because it would discourage,

848
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,430
you know,
who didn't encourage the wrong behavior

849
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,440
and so only the doctor is punished,
but you saw him change his opinion in 24

850
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:15,490
hours just by being a little more
informed and hearing that the public was

851
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:18,130
all on the same side,
so that's interesting.

852
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,090
So he,
he'll beNd with the breeze in and I kind

853
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:25,810
of flip flopping.
Common political term is in the

854
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,160
political realm.
It would be flip flopping and you know,

855
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,480
he has no moral backbone,
but you're saying it's receptive to the

856
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:34,240
public's desires.
He's a businessperson in the business

857
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:38,680
realm is more like ab testing,
which is you're rapidly testing things.

858
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:41,320
You see what the response is and you
adjust if you don't get the right,

859
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:44,530
but that's also like one of the
criticisms of him is that he talks off

860
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:47,470
the cuff without really having
researched or thought deeply about these

861
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,090
subjects.
And when you're talking about a guy

862
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:52,510
who's supposed to be the leader of the
greatest country in the world's ever

863
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:53,344
known,
like,

864
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,980
that guy should probably not do that.
I'm going to put,

865
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,700
I'm going to put a different filter on
that.

866
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,860
Okay.
From the persuasion filter,

867
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,440
since facts and logic and policies and
stuff don't matter as much as you want.

868
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,680
When you See him ignoring things that
you just think,

869
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,230
man,
a reasonable person would not say that a

870
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:15,220
reasonable person would not ignore that
he ignores things because they don't

871
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,860
matter.
You think he's ignoring something very

872
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:21,850
important and he would perform better if
he did what you imagine is the right way

873
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,620
to act?
I don't think so,

874
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,400
but you don't think it's important to
not arrest women who get illegal

875
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:29,350
abortions?
No.

876
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,030
I'm saying,
do you know what I'm saying?

877
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:32,950
Like that's an important thing to pay
attention to,

878
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:34,450
right?
If you have an opinion on it.

879
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,590
Well,
what I'm saying,

880
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,890
what I'm saying is that the things you
would need to know to be a president.

881
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,570
Okay.
And let's say,

882
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,610
let's say hillary clinton knows them
all.

883
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,220
Let's let's say she's attended attended
of just knowledge.

884
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,660
if he's a six,
which probably is a generous,

885
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,360
there probably isn't any decision that
he won't have.

886
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,050
Advisors were filling it.
Say they becomes an informed as he needs

887
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:58,510
to know exactly the way a ceo would run
something.

888
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,040
Okay,
so this is not really related to that

889
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,130
one particular subject.
No,

890
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,330
that was just an example of him.
I understand what You're saying is

891
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,460
changing.
When he became more Informed,

892
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:08,140
he didn't.
He didn't stick to an old opinion.

893
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,170
Even as the facts change.
And this has done the same thing with

894
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:12,330
obamacare as well.
Right?

895
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,840
Met with obama and said,
okay,

896
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,240
maybe there's some things about
obamacare that we might want to keep.

897
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,380
So what he does,
we call pacIng and leading in the.

898
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:25,650
In the hypnosis I the bullshitting.
No,

899
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,900
and here's how it's different.
What he does is he agrees with people

900
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,570
emotionally first.
It gets you on your side emotionally.

901
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,770
So if you're really concerned about
immigration,

902
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,570
for example,
he doesn't just say,

903
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,000
hey,
yeah,

904
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,760
I'm,
I'm concerned about that too.

905
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,800
That would be sort of a hillary clinton
approach.

906
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,170
Being less concerned that you are,
but you know,

907
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:45,260
I got other priorities.
he's way more concerned than you are if

908
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:48,230
you're a little bit worried about
immigration and he's worried about,

909
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,060
you know,
isis coming over here and putting people

910
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,250
in cages and cutting off heads and my
god,

911
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:57,251
there's a hordes coming over the border,
so he's so on your side that when he

912
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:01,340
changes toward the middle and you knew
we had to because you have to do that

913
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:05,060
when you get in the general election
that his side was not feeling betrayed

914
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,320
because they're saying,
well,

915
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,380
if he's changing the specifics of his
policy,

916
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,580
it must be because he looked into it and
that's what's interesting.

917
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,580
that's what's practical,
so they're willing to go with him if

918
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:18,920
they feel that he's on their side
emotionally,

919
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,000
so he always sides with people
emotionally goes as big as possible.

920
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,480
Uses hyperbole.
He says he does that and it gives them

921
00:42:26,481 --> 00:42:29,360
also gives them room to negotiate back
to the middle and everybody says,

922
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:31,280
my god,
I'm happy now you're negotiated back to

923
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,114
the middle.

924
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,460
Wow,
that's interesting.

925
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,490
It's interesting,
but why do I feel like just getting

926
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,400
lucky?
I feel like it's really shitty

927
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:43,610
competition.
Hillary clinton is a terrible example of

928
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:46,700
someone who should be running the
country in so many ways and she beat him

929
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:49,160
in the popular vote.
You know what I mean?

930
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,140
She's like,
she's got a lot of dirt on.

931
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,200
So she beat him in the contest.
They weren't having the result.

932
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,090
That was the only one contest.
It's true.

933
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,590
And he won that one.
That's true.

934
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,590
What's hilarious is in 2012,
he was saying it was a rigged system

935
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,720
because of that contest.
You know what I mean?

936
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:05,810
He was talking about the popular vote
and you know,

937
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:06,630
how it,
what was it?

938
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,190
Which,
which,

939
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,660
what year was it where it went to al
gore?

940
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,630
What year was it where al gore won the
popular vote,

941
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,640
but it was,
it did carry when.

942
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,220
No,
kerry number one the popular road.

943
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,580
Right.
It was just al gore.

944
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:18,540
Al gore won the popular vote against
bush,

945
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,370
right?
Yeah.

946
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,630
By like a half a million.

947
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,120
Yeah.
So every year there's going to be this

948
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:26,450
conversation anytime the voter's rights
close.

949
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,390
Um,
but what you see is that

950
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,300
trump doesn't care about,
let's say,

951
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:36,750
the consistency or what somebody would
say is being a hypocrite.

952
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:42,000
I've tweeted this recently that the
least persuasive thing you could ever

953
00:43:42,001 --> 00:43:44,010
say in politics,
if you're trying to change somebody's

954
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,910
mind,
is that person's a hypocrite in all,

955
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,370
in all of history.
That's never changed anybody's mind.

956
00:43:50,371 --> 00:43:51,390
Nobody ever said,
oh,

957
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,050
slap my head.
I didn't really realize that bottoms up.

958
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,600
You mean about a politician by
politician?

959
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,620
Yeah.
Well,

960
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,890
we accept a certain amount of bullshit,
but we also accept that they used to say

961
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:04,500
one thing and now they say another and
it just seems so normal.

962
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:07,830
It's in the baseline.
Don't you think that the being the

963
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:10,830
president is an impossible job?
It's impossible.

964
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,840
It just doesn't seem like anybody could
really do it.

965
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:17,940
It's both impossible and the easiest job
in the sense that the office of the

966
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:22,020
president and all the advisors and all
the public opinion is going to force you

967
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:26,190
down to just a few possible options and
those two options will,

968
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,740
you will not have enough information to
know which one's better.

969
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,450
So,
so anyone,

970
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:34,140
anybody among the last two options that
they've narrowed it down to,

971
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,830
there's a little bit of luck involved.
I got to say now.

972
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:39,570
So what do you mean by this?
WeLl,

973
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:42,450
you have to match the personality and
the time,

974
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:44,040
right?
So you could have a,

975
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,970
a president who is just terrific in
wartime but weren't much good at

976
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:50,580
anything else.
So they'd be,

977
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:51,690
you know,
next thing you know,

978
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:56,691
they're on mount rushmore because.
But you have obama whose primary job was

979
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:01,971
winding down to ors and basically
cleaning up and bass and keeping us from

980
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,530
a larger product problem.

981
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,180
You know,
the economy melting down.

982
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,890
So obama is really the presidency of
things he prevented that could have been

983
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:13,800
worse,
but I would put them in the top 20

984
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:17,670
percent of presidents.
So my view of him is very positive and I

985
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:22,671
think even obamacare is a genius
persuasive move even in its failure

986
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,010
because he set it up that way.
And he said that publicly.

987
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,040
He said,
I'm going to launch it ugly.

988
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,670
I'm paraphrasing,
didn't get exactly what I wanted in this

989
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:34,410
law,
but once it's out there,

990
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,340
it will be impossible for politicians to
pull back coverage.

991
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,370
They'll just have to fix it.
So where are we today?

992
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:45,560
Everybody's saying obama,
total failure without obamacare because

993
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,570
we're going to keep the good parts.
Keywords keep the good parts exactly as

994
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,810
he fucking plan and said so publicly.
He said it,

995
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,820
he said it publicly.
He said,

996
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,560
I'm going to do this ugly,
wrong,

997
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,170
and you're going to have to fix it
because it's going to be the only choice

998
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:02,310
you have.
And that's what,

999
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,170
that's what trump's gonna do.
He's gonna fix it.

1000
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,950
So what is he going to fix?
Probably he's going to keep the main

1001
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:14,820
parts and probably shift some money
around from something,

1002
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:15,910
you know,
I'm not,

1003
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,230
I'm not sure that fix looks like a
miracle fix.

1004
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,360
I don't knoW that that's in our future.
And I'm.

1005
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,220
No,
I'm no expert on obamacare.

1006
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,060
Well,
there's this weird thing that we've done

1007
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:27,540
now with,
uh,

1008
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,080
with trump that I've never seen before.
We've,

1009
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:34,940
we've narrowed them down to chance and
slogans like I talked to in this podcast

1010
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:39,710
about I was in New York city at the time
of the protests because I was there for

1011
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:42,350
the ufc and uh,
we were walking from the gym to the

1012
00:46:42,351 --> 00:46:47,060
hotel and we just got caught in this
wave of people screaming with really

1013
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,360
fucking crazy science man.
There wasn't a whole lot of love and

1014
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:54,180
compassion on their signs that we were
talking about this before the podcast

1015
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:56,180
started,
that the left has become something very

1016
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,820
different.
It's like this really aggressive,

1017
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,410
uh,
insulting shaming and even the call for

1018
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:05,630
violence,
like there's people with rape melania

1019
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:06,860
signs.
It's like,

1020
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:07,820
this is crazy.
Yeah,

1021
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:10,970
there's pictures of him online.
So the big question is,

1022
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,090
well,
I have one foot in the,

1023
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,580
you know,
the alt right world because I sample

1024
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:18,310
everything over there.
But I'm also watching cnn and regular

1025
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:22,390
media and these,
these folks live in completely different

1026
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,650
realities because they have different
inforMation because they're looking at

1027
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:30,220
different sources.
So within the conservative of things,

1028
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,370
it is,
it is understood universally understood

1029
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:37,090
that the protesters are professional and
they're paid by soros.

1030
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:38,320
And by the way,
I'm not saying this,

1031
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,570
I'm saying what their view is on the
other side,

1032
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,060
people think it's a true grassroots
movement.

1033
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,140
Um,
and so the view is completely two

1034
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:47,950
different worlds.

1035
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,320
Well,
there may very well be some people that

1036
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:53,830
have been paid to protest,
but there is absolutely a bunch of

1037
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:55,720
people that are protesting because
they're upset.

1038
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,010
I mean,
it might be fluffed up a little bit,

1039
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,230
I don't know,
but there's definitely people that are

1040
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:04,870
just young people that are pissed off or
old people that are pissed off.

1041
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:08,590
There's people that are just upset.
The question was whether the protests

1042
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:12,880
would have lasted in spread.
And ben as well organized protest.

1043
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:14,260
Scott adams.
It's fun.

1044
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,780
You feel like you're doing something.
You're blocking wilshire.

1045
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,710
Fuck you people,
you know.

1046
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:20,020
And this guy,
I mean,

1047
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,070
what I was saying about it boiled down
to a slogan like,

1048
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,440
there's a bunch of,
not my fucking president,

1049
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,080
you know,
like that kind of shit like Donald

1050
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,271
Trump,
k,

1051
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,104
k,
k.

1052
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:34,750
It's like they want to like yell out
things they associate with him,

1053
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:37,120
which I've never seen before.
So there's about a president.

1054
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,480
So.
So I write about this extensively.

1055
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,170
So the best persuasion is fear,
right?

1056
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:46,560
So in the beginning of the election,
trump had the best persuasion because he

1057
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:48,600
was saying the terrorists are coming in
and you know,

1058
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:50,250
I'll stop them.
There's criminals,

1059
00:48:50,251 --> 00:48:54,030
criminal cross the border.
Clinton was talking boring policies and

1060
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,020
um,
experienced.

1061
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,060
So she didn't have a chance against,
you know,

1062
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:01,770
you're going to die tomorrow by summer.
She obviously had some professional

1063
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,620
help,
meaning somebody who's a cognitive

1064
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:09,621
scientist or a professional persuader.
And she started using the term dark all

1065
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,090
the time and all the surrogates used it
at the same time.

1066
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,081
It's dark,
dark,

1067
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:17,160
dark.
And she started coloring him as a huge

1068
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:19,430
racist.
Dictators.

1069
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,680
Dangerous to the world and the most
dangerous thing in the world.

1070
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,510
Because if you're worried about
terrorism,

1071
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,140
you're really worried about somebody
else getting killed because you're not

1072
00:49:28,141 --> 00:49:30,120
really thinking you get killed by
terrorists.

1073
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,590
You know,
even if it's pretty bad,

1074
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,420
somebody else's getting killed.
But clinton painted a picture to make

1075
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:37,950
you afraid of,
of,

1076
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:38,721
uh,
you know,

1077
00:49:38,721 --> 00:49:43,721
the nuclear holocaust created by trump
tweeting something at 3:00 AM and I

1078
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,450
don't know,
hitting the button accidentally.

1079
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,170
And so that was the ultimate fear.
So she really had that going.

1080
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:50,004
So,
uh,

1081
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:55,370
and when she lost,
she had all these people activated who

1082
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:59,490
would've been instantly deactivated if
trump had lost,

1083
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,250
but there's no deactivation on the
bottom.

1084
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:07,251
Now she created this society societal
bomb that is these protests in the way

1085
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:11,760
people feel they're.
These people literally believe that

1086
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:13,340
hitler was just elected,
you know,

1087
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,560
a version of hitler who will will.
And I saw,

1088
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,580
I actually saw today journalists talking
about concentration camps and that sort

1089
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:25,980
of thing.
I believe nothing even remotely like,

1090
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:30,190
that's going to happen or you know,
or I would obviously be on,

1091
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,260
on the side of the protestors.
So it's not their view of the world.

1092
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,090
Is that the trump supporters?
No,

1093
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:40,610
he's a racist.
And they installed them because they

1094
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:44,870
want them to go do racist things.
Trump supporters know that even within

1095
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:47,460
the ranks,
it's like two percent people are our

1096
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,760
actual races.
And I've never met one,

1097
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,460
like the hardcore guide and I'd never
even met one.

1098
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,220
I bet we can introduce you to some
people if we just asked around.

1099
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,200
I think it wouldn't be hard to find one,
but the boat and had a very funny line.

1100
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,390
He said not all trump supporters are
racist,

1101
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,670
but all racists or trump's

1102
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,160
porters.
So the,

1103
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,330
so what we have here is a situation
where the racists are living in their

1104
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:13,660
own little world and they think they
actually got their guy.

1105
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,840
Most trump supporters just like,
hey,

1106
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,340
less taxes,
you know,

1107
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,490
that they're thinking they like his
personality though,

1108
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,290
just like something about him.
And the clinton supporters think that

1109
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,090
hitler actually got elected.
So they're acting on that.

1110
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,790
So.
And so what's happened is that clinton

1111
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:33,370
has somewhat accidentally,
because she thought she was going to

1112
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:35,200
win,
at which point this whole problem goes

1113
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:36,490
away.
Uh,

1114
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:41,290
somewhat accidentally created this
gigantic societal bomb that there's no

1115
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:44,920
way to diffuse.
But a number of people including me are

1116
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:48,190
trying to figure it out.
I had to literally d hypnotize people

1117
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:51,760
who were in this illusion that the world
war three just started.

1118
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,190
Well,
it's,

1119
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,930
it was very disturbing to me.
One of the,

1120
00:51:56,931 --> 00:52:01,931
one of the big ones was when she was
confronted about the dnc hack and uh,

1121
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,470
her emails and all that stuff,
the hacked emails from our server where

1122
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:11,810
she diverted attention by saying that it
was Russia that did this and that there

1123
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:14,300
would be repercussions.
And tHen she said,

1124
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:19,540
even possibly militarily,
like that's the worst diffusion of

1125
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:24,020
responsibility ever.
Like you were talking about you deleting

1126
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:29,021
emails after a subpoena and your
argument is that the russians got those

1127
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:31,550
emails and we should bomb them.
I mean,

1128
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:35,390
that's literally what she saying.
That was crazy when she said there would

1129
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:38,090
be repercussions militarily to fucking
Russia.

1130
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,560
Like what?
Russia.

1131
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,750
We're not talking about invading puerto
rico.

1132
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,360
It's fucking Russia.
Like you're saying there's going to be

1133
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:49,070
military invasions because someone stole
your email

1134
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,700
that wasn't secure.
I'm going to defend her.

1135
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,750
Please do.
I'm going to go to surprise you a little

1136
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:55,351
bit.
Oh boy.

1137
00:52:55,351 --> 00:52:57,000
Here we go.
We should have a drink.

1138
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,900
Do you drink?
I don't anymore at any moment.

1139
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,040
You stop.
It just gave me sinus problems.

1140
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,570
So I stopped several years ago.
I feel much healthier.

1141
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,710
Alright dude.
Um,

1142
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,930
no pressure.
What was I talking about?

1143
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,850
Uh,
you were gonna defend hillary clinton

1144
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,480
because I was saying that her saying
that we're going to attack Russia

1145
00:53:15,481 --> 00:53:17,990
because of emails is kinda crazy.
So the way leaders stock

1146
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,190
with each other Is,
you know,

1147
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:21,040
this is my red line,
don't do this.

1148
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:24,080
This is serious.
That's not the same as saying if you got

1149
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:25,680
my email,
I'm going to you tomorrow.

1150
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,100
There is,
there's a certain amount of seriousness

1151
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,280
which you must convey,
which is separate from what he actually

1152
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:36,810
going to do.
So she was conveying I'm a Ten and a 10

1153
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:41,820
maximum code red seriousness if you,
if you got my fucking emails.

1154
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,530
And,
and,

1155
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,810
and it changed the course of our,
of our republic because that's where she

1156
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:50,570
was at the legend.
Now I don't know if anything,

1157
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,790
any of this happened and they're smart
people who said maybe the russians were

1158
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,830
in or some russian hackers were involved
in.

1159
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,810
WeLl,
here's the problem.

1160
00:53:56,811 --> 00:53:58,580
There's no evidence that the russians
did it.

1161
00:53:58,581 --> 00:54:01,970
Not only that,
the fbi and the cia don't think there's

1162
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:03,830
russians don't think the russians did
it.

1163
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,550
Like it wasn't something that there was
any definitive proof.

1164
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,150
It was find out who jamie see if he
could pull this up,

1165
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,200
who believed that it was Russia and who
didn't believe it was Russia because

1166
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:19,100
there was some like very prominent
security people that were hired to

1167
00:54:19,101 --> 00:54:21,440
investigate zero evidence.
It was Russia,

1168
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,810
so it was just a diffusion.
It's an end.

1169
00:54:23,811 --> 00:54:28,100
You could tell that it was a planned
diffusion because of that white house

1170
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:31,610
correspondents dinner.
She made a joke about riding a horse

1171
00:54:31,611 --> 00:54:34,590
with putin.
like she made this russian joke.

1172
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:38,840
So there's this like theme and it was a
shit joke to whoever wrote it should be

1173
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:40,490
slapped.
It was terrible.

1174
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,130
Like the way it was set up was it was if
somebody,

1175
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,430
if somebody pitched that around the joke
writers table,

1176
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,550
you know,
like it was like it was tony hinchcliffe

1177
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:50,960
and Jeff Ross,
or they'd be like,

1178
00:54:50,961 --> 00:54:51,321
no,
no,

1179
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,760
no,
that one's not going to do that.

1180
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:56,180
THat's a terrible joke.
It's just not a good joke and she,

1181
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,100
you know,
didn't know how to deliver it either and

1182
00:54:58,101 --> 00:55:03,101
it was just a clunky,
an extra attempt to connect putin and

1183
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,600
trump because people are scared of
Russia,

1184
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,410
but it was so shitty and ham handed that
it just didn't work.

1185
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,390
And everybody knows there's no fucking
evidence.

1186
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,070
I mean,
there's no evidence of russia's doing

1187
00:55:13,071 --> 00:55:14,000
anything.
None.

1188
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,770
Russia thing took her from,
you know,

1189
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,910
serious statesperson,
you know,

1190
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,340
the most experienced person who ever ran
for president to a little bit.

1191
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:25,470
Ridiculous.
Yes.

1192
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,403
She had desperate

1193
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,600
bose desperate move.
So you didn't have any other options.

1194
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:31,730
She,
she went code red.

1195
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,910
She started talking shit back.
She started making things up back and

1196
00:55:35,911 --> 00:55:37,800
connecting him to like,
he was just.

1197
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,670
The whole thing was so sorted.
To me that was the most unfortunate

1198
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,480
thing about it.
When you do see all this stuff on tv,

1199
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,300
one thing that you can't deny,
it might not affect you and it might not

1200
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,870
affect me,
but there are certain people that fall

1201
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:54,840
the tone of the leaders of this country.
And when you have a guy who's the

1202
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:58,950
president,
who you know is going to say insulting,

1203
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:02,650
should call John Stewart a pussy in,
in a tweet at 1:30 in the morning,

1204
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,510
like that sets the tone for the country
and it's going to make some people very

1205
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:08,460
happy.
There's some people that love to talk

1206
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:10,030
shit.
They loved insult people and they're

1207
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:10,940
like,
fuck yeah,

1208
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,090
open season.

1209
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,700
the way I described that,
I said political correctness took a

1210
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:17,160
missile to the deq because that's what
it was like.

1211
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,130
This is the,
this is the guy at the top of the totem

1212
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:24,190
pole and we can relax our standards now.
All The things that had been annoying

1213
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:26,350
you,
but people nitpicking about behaviors

1214
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:31,210
and insults and safe words and safe
spaces and all that stuff's kinda gone.

1215
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,620
Uh,
yeah.

1216
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:33,454
I mean,
yeah.

1217
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,300
So it does affect the way people think
and behave right there.

1218
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:40,300
There's almost nobody who won't use the
word pussy in public.

1219
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:42,270
They do,
do,

1220
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,590
do,
do you remember so many months ago when

1221
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:47,630
that just wasn't a thing.
You couldn't say that.

1222
00:56:47,631 --> 00:56:51,580
That's so drew.
It became like a constant like dinner

1223
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:53,760
table talk,
like people sitting around talking st

1224
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,410
grab the pussy and discovery from women.
It's not even deciding.

1225
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,220
Not even bend.
My girlfriend says so true.

1226
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,650
It's so true.
That is so true.

1227
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,420
That's interesting.
Yeah.

1228
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,770
Well,
you know,

1229
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,760
I think that we go one way and we go to
the other and I think that people get

1230
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:11,260
tired of too much left and they want
some.

1231
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,090
Right.
And I think that's why we went from

1232
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:16,120
carter to reagan.
That's why we went from bush to clinton.

1233
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,840
I just think that's what we do.
I think it's what we've always done and

1234
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,110
I think people are.
I,

1235
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,020
I also believe,
and I've said this publicly,

1236
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:26,680
I think the whole caitlyn jenner thing
had a big effect on because people were

1237
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,480
like,
why in the fuck are we doing?

1238
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,930
That's the athlete of the year.
This is woman of the year for glamour

1239
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:35,350
magazine,
and then you see her on the ellen show

1240
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,240
and she doesn't believe in gay marriage
and you're like,

1241
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,760
we're,
this is madness.

1242
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,670
We're,
we're accepting madness as being okay.

1243
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:48,120
And I think because of that,
like we're so accepting and so sensitive

1244
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,690
that anything involving gender gets a
free pass on all of its ludicrous

1245
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:55,450
aspects.
Like she's a ludicrous person.

1246
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,030
but we gave it a free pass because she
used to be a man that she became a

1247
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,890
woman.
She will fucking doesn't believe in gay

1248
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:01,640
marriage.
It's so crazy.

1249
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,190
When,
when ellen asked her about it,

1250
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:03,701
she was like,
well,

1251
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:05,170
I'm cronenberg traditional welsh.
Like,

1252
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,193
what?
What?

1253
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,440
Wait,
what the fuck did you even just say

1254
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:10,480
you're,
you're a traditional girl.

1255
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,520
holy shit,
this is crazy.

1256
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,490
But we're not supposed to say anything.
We're supposed to just accept it.

1257
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,560
Well,
there's people at home all across the

1258
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:20,650
country throwing their fucking beer cans
in the kitchen.

1259
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:21,700
Just flipped out.
Fuck.

1260
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:23,740
Are we doing?
What are we doing?

1261
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:28,540
And I think there's this reaction when
things go way too far left when there's

1262
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,970
78 different gender pronouns that you
have to learn.

1263
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,720
When you know political correctness,
take some crazy path where you're

1264
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:39,640
removing the general these confederate
flag from the roof and pulling it off a

1265
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,280
tv land.
We've got to get this fucking.

1266
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:45,970
It just like things go so far left that
there's an automatic slingshot effect

1267
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:48,430
and they start going right again.
I'm okay with getting rid of the

1268
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:50,420
confederate flag By the way.
I think they could have.

1269
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,470
Well,
you know,

1270
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,770
it,
it does represent bad things to people,

1271
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:58,420
but can you just fucking go in there and
cgi that shit or something or is it okay

1272
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,600
to have it in there because it
represents the past,

1273
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,280
right?
like you could go to,

1274
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,530
you can go to watch,
um,

1275
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,180
al jolson videos on youtube and you
could watch them.

1276
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,950
Here's my take on that.
People don't ask a lot from other

1277
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:13,790
people,
but you.

1278
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:16,840
So you have this confederate flag,
bunch of people like it because it's

1279
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:17,171
like,
oh,

1280
00:59:17,171 --> 00:59:18,360
it's the best.
It'S the south.

1281
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,200
So you know,
you want to respect the people like what

1282
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:22,034
they like.

1283
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,670
But another big part of the public,
it's just really,

1284
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,480
really offended by it.
Like not in a normal offensive way,

1285
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,070
like you said,
a bad word,

1286
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,233
but like,
you know,

1287
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,220
the deepest pain the country has ever
experienced the slavery.

1288
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,680
So if you can't,
if you can't allow your fellow citizen,

1289
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,940
you know,
that little bit of respect,

1290
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:44,571
it's like,
yeah,

1291
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:47,570
this is really inconvenient.
I wish I could keep my confederate flag,

1292
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,540
whatever.
But they're not asking a lot.

1293
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,020
It's just not a lot.
It's true.

1294
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,910
Unless you own the dukes of hazard,
you're like,

1295
00:59:55,911 --> 00:59:59,660
where's my fucking mOney?
What are you kidding me?

1296
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,270
We've had played it for 50 years.
What happened?

1297
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,810
Well,
it represents not just slavery,

1298
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:10,370
which is one of the most awful things
that has ever happened to human beings.

1299
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:14,420
The other awful thing is war represents
a war civil war,

1300
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:18,200
so the two most awful things,
slavery and war,

1301
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,930
it represents both of those represents a
war between two people in the same two

1302
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,800
groups of people on the same land,
mass over slavery.

1303
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:30,010
So It's death on top of horrific in
capturing and enslaving of people.

1304
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:33,650
It's like everything bad,
and I hate to be insensitive,

1305
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:36,170
but they weren't the winning side
troops,

1306
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:41,210
so they did lose.
But what's interesting is it just a few

1307
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,620
decades ago,
whenever the dukes of hazzard was on tv,

1308
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:45,650
it didn't bother us at all.
That's really fascinating to me that

1309
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:47,870
they were allowed to have it and it
wasn't an issue,

1310
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,070
but I don't know.
I don't.

1311
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,520
Yeah,
maybe just people weren't thinking about

1312
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:53,120
it that way,
but once you started thinking about it,

1313
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,550
so the thing isn't that fascinating that
it wasn't an issue,

1314
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,880
but we were all aware of it.
All of our issues or psychological.

1315
01:00:59,240 --> 01:00:59,960
I mean,
you know,

1316
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,360
once you got food and nobody's shooting
at you,

1317
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,360
your problems tend to be mental.
Yeah.

1318
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,550
Yeah.
Unless that whatever that image is

1319
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,100
provoking violence.
Right.

1320
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,890
You know,
like the nazi flag you can't have,

1321
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:15,320
they lost to which you can't have that
one.

1322
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:16,870
We won't give you that one.
Right.

1323
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,863
Yeah.
And again,

1324
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:23,060
it's like people don't ask a lot.
That's just not a lot to ask to.

1325
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,210
Isn't that fascinating?
Like the english came when we had a war

1326
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:27,044
with england,
right?

1327
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,600
For our independence.
They killed a lot of americans.

1328
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:31,220
You could have an english flag flying
high.

1329
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,350
Nobody gives a fuck.
You know,

1330
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,520
that ended so politely though,
did it?

1331
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,650
I mean,
I think,

1332
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:41,080
I think the british,
they lose territory better than anybody.

1333
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,960
They'll give you their sword.
Well,

1334
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,770
we conquered much of the world,
but uh,

1335
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,560
okay.
This one didn't work out.

1336
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,830
You put up a good fight,
good for you.

1337
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,600
Good for you.
Take your country back.

1338
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,690
it is interesting though that there's
some people that would argue for the

1339
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,300
confederate flag,
but almost no one would argue for the

1340
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:01,630
nazi flag.
Well,

1341
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,170
it was probably somebody does,
but yeah,

1342
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,460
I know what you're saying.
You know what I mean?

1343
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:05,330
The nazis.
I mean,

1344
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:09,590
it couldn't have been that everyone in
Germany was represented by the nazis.

1345
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:11,420
Right.
There's never a group.

1346
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:15,740
There's never 100 percent compliance and
group mindset of any fucking country.

1347
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,750
It's never existed.
Right.

1348
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,040
It's just not how people are.
So we give the

1349
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,850
germans a pass because they were a part
of that whole nazi flag thing.

1350
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,920
But when we look at the confederate
flag,

1351
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,250
like if you're down with that,
you have to be.

1352
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:32,010
It has to be like the two core things.
One,

1353
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,320
you're at war with the north until you
believe in slavery.

1354
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:35,550
That's it.
You know,

1355
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,080
it can't just be,
I'm a leonard scattered fan,

1356
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,810
you know,
images,

1357
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,690
images.
like I said,

1358
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,150
in the very beginning,
visual persuasion is the strongest it

1359
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:45,984
is.
You just want,

1360
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,500
you just don't want to look at that
thing if you're on the wrong side of,

1361
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:50,880
you know,
that part of history.

1362
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,660
I was thinking about that once because I
went to cheech and eatsa the where the

1363
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,860
mayan pyramids are in the yucatan.
And uh,

1364
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,570
when we were driving,
it's a long drive to get to the

1365
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:02,820
pyramids.
And as we're driving and saw this giant

1366
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,590
cocacola billboard,
I said,

1367
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:09,120
how bizarre is that symbol like that
symbols so etched in the consciousness

1368
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:11,310
of most people in the modern world.

1369
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,550
But to see it in the jungle was so
strange.

1370
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,370
It's just this giant thing that
represent.

1371
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:17,990
I mean,
it,

1372
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:22,990
it's like instantaneous representation.
Was it new or was it leftover from the,

1373
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,270
the,
the mayan civilization that had it.

1374
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,900
It was newer than that.
Newer than that.

1375
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,150
but I mean,
symbols are very strange.

1376
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,171
I mean,
we,

1377
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:34,801
we,
uh,

1378
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:37,710
we accept them and they have become a
normal part of our society.

1379
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:39,660
When you drive it down the road and you
go,

1380
01:03:39,661 --> 01:03:40,530
oh,
what kind of car is that?

1381
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:41,480
And you see the bow tie.
Oh,

1382
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,560
it's a chevy.
Like these symbols,

1383
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,380
like the instantaneous recognizable
symbols.

1384
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:50,730
Have you noticed how easily boys can
recognize the model of a car?

1385
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,970
Oh yeah.
There's some kind of weird,

1386
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,590
um,
gender specific skill.

1387
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,240
Oh,
I don't think so because brian cowen

1388
01:03:57,241 --> 01:04:00,300
doesn't know jack shit about cars.
Brian kennedy could recognize like a

1389
01:04:00,301 --> 01:04:01,860
tesla and a car.

1390
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,800
Maybe he's owned maybe,
but it would have to be in the last

1391
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,471
couple of years.
He is.

1392
01:04:05,471 --> 01:04:07,110
No,
I've never met a grown man.

1393
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:10,200
It's like a manly guy who knows less
cares less about cars,

1394
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,780
but still if you said what's that model
of car?

1395
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:15,690
And it was probably wouldn't know.
He'd see a mustang and the camaro.

1396
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,740
Okay.
Trust me,

1397
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:19,110
lIke he is just brutal.
I've had conversation with them.

1398
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:23,070
I'm not a fucking 69 mustang.
You can't tell.

1399
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,160
They look at that.
The debt doesn't say that's a

1400
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:28,530
[inaudible] 69 mustang to you turning
your god damn America card.

1401
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:29,980
Turn it in.
Boy.

1402
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,430
Sixty nine camaro.
Casey.

1403
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,530
A 69 camaro.
You should fucking know what that is.

1404
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,180
You should just know as a man.
I wouldn't know a 68,

1405
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,960
69.
You should look at the headlights.

1406
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,500
Taillights are different.
Everything's different.

1407
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:46,710
In 68 have the same boxy tail lights
that the 67 hand,

1408
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,020
whereas the 69 is lengthened a little
bit.

1409
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,970
Well,
$69 a year.

1410
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,810
That's the right year to change my name
to caitlyn and no,

1411
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:57,300
you don't have to get.
Maybe she knows a lot about cars.

1412
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,040
That was the other thIng about the
caitlin thing that drove me crazy.

1413
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,200
She killed somebody,
knock someone into traffic,

1414
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:06,720
knock some leading the traffic and she
wasn't paying attention.

1415
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,930
Lady went head on into traffic.
Someone slammed into her and killed her

1416
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,240
hummer.
One of the last hummers in America

1417
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:15,420
slammed in her and killed her and it
never gets discussed.

1418
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,920
She goes,
does talk shows and instead of talking

1419
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:21,220
about this horrific accident that caused
some fellow human their life,

1420
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:24,970
she talks about gender and nail polish.
Well,

1421
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,260
yeah,
exactly.

1422
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:28,300
I did not know about this.
We didn't know about that.

1423
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,111
Yeah,
you didn't know.

1424
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:30,610
See,
that's a big part of the problem.

1425
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,610
I've been bad at caitlin,
uh,

1426
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,240
since,
since,

1427
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:36,250
uh,
she was bruce because I happened to be

1428
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:40,960
at a flight one time across country and
bruce at the time was in the seat in

1429
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:45,760
front of me and leaned is a seed all the
way back and I couldn't use my laptop

1430
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:46,594
for five hours.

1431
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:49,930
And you're mad about that,
but that's.

1432
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,360
Can you lean your back?
You have more room?

1433
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,710
It doesn't really work that way because
can you put your laptop on your lap?

1434
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,550
Like a actual lap top?
That coulD work.

1435
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,060
You could have done it if I was right
next to you how to fix this whole thing.

1436
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,200
If only the lab you were like,
I'm glad he's a Chickie.

1437
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:12,340
Fucking ruined my typing this.
This is why it's called the laptop.

1438
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,660
Yeah,
it sits in your lap,

1439
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:16,060
but then your balls get really warm and
they say it kills sperm.

1440
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,150
So it depends on what you're trying to
accomplish.

1441
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,300
For some people they'd be just heating
them babies up all the time.

1442
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,850
It was a long flight.
I might want to kill a few just to.

1443
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:30,300
Just to take the pressure off is to
relax the my friend already should fear

1444
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,040
always gets mad at that too.

1445
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,500
People lean back on him because he's so
big.

1446
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:37,560
He's like six [inaudible] six three or
something.

1447
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,340
Six four.
He's super tall,

1448
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:43,300
so he's got these goofy ass stork legs
and he can't fit them under the seat.

1449
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:44,340
Anyway.
God,

1450
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:48,010
I feel sorry for tall people.
Anytime they try to travel anywhere

1451
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:49,900
outside their own house.
Even in cars,

1452
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:51,600
you know,
you get in someone's car sometimes and

1453
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:52,750
your legs are jammed up.
I'm like,

1454
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:55,670
I'm fucking five.
Eight and my legs are jammed up on what

1455
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,950
is a giant person do.
Yeah.

1456
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,050
I'm trying to think like what would be
my equivalent,

1457
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,580
like how small would the car have to be
so I could feel what was shack feels

1458
01:07:03,581 --> 01:07:06,670
like when he gets the car,
he has to take seats out and put seats

1459
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:08,950
in the back.
Have you ever seen him with a do to cars

1460
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:10,150
for him?
Really?

1461
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,950
Yeah.
He's had some custom made cars where

1462
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:15,880
they literally take the seat out of the
front and install it in the back.

1463
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,351
I mean,
that's not,

1464
01:07:17,351 --> 01:07:18,610
that might look,
you know,

1465
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:22,460
you think about it,
he's seven feet tall so that this thing

1466
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:26,080
about how much more length you're
dealing with his arms,

1467
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:27,510
his legs,
and then his,

1468
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,410
the height,
like I bet they would have to lower the

1469
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:31,450
seat down so you could see better out of
the windshield.

1470
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,240
Otherwise he has to kind of bend down
every time he's driving.

1471
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,470
I just says this vision of him with a
miata sitting in the trunk,

1472
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,740
the trunk open,
you know,

1473
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,790
just.
I bet he can't drive a miata.

1474
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,040
I bet he can't.
I bet there's no way that he can get

1475
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:48,100
farther,
far enough back strap one to each foot

1476
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:50,750
and skated.
Well he would,

1477
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,940
he could do is just put the steering
wheel.

1478
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,340
He's so rich because could have the
steering wheel put in the middle and

1479
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,700
then push everything back.
No,

1480
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,550
forget that idea.
But I know for sure for sure they had

1481
01:08:01,551 --> 01:08:05,230
one of those custom tv shows,
custom car shows where they do things

1482
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:06,970
for people.
Maybe it was west side.

1483
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,430
What does that one show?
West coast,

1484
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,500
west coast,
west coast customers.

1485
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:14,890
Maybe that one famous company,
so they took her car and they put the

1486
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:18,620
seat in the back for him.
Probably still needed extra room,

1487
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:23,420
like suddenly you do for tv.
Can we gotta we gotta put the seat in

1488
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:27,910
the back maybe because I got a feeling
he drives a regular cars somehow.

1489
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,680
Maybe there's probably some cars that he
can't drive though.

1490
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,530
Like one of those old porsches little
tiny ones.

1491
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,230
Probably most of the.
Yeah.

1492
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,890
Anyway,
point being what were we?

1493
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,140
Oh,
it's terrible to be as general leaned

1494
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,780
back and fucked up your day.

1495
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,850
Yeah.
All went bad from there.

1496
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,103
You know,
and look,

1497
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,230
there's nothing.
I mean he's not terrible person.

1498
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:51,470
She's not a terrible person.
It's not the worst human in the world.

1499
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,490
It's just like when this gets paraded
out as being like this very important

1500
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:58,100
point.
As soon as he gets paraded out and you

1501
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:00,290
make a big deal and you want to go on
all these talk shows,

1502
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:02,060
you want to talk about yourself and done
well,

1503
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:06,680
they have to examine you as an actual
person and not just stop at gender.

1504
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,880
You know what I'm saying?
Like there's,

1505
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,690
there's a lot of representatives,
like for instance,

1506
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,940
um,
the,

1507
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,510
the woman who created sirius satellite
radio and also,

1508
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:22,511
I believe she invented gps.
She was born a man and had a sex change.

1509
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,110
And uh,
I met with her and had an interview with

1510
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:28,780
her about her.
Um,

1511
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:29,510
her.

1512
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:32,720
She made a robot,
she's super fucking smart,

1513
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:37,520
like crazy smart and is working on
artificial intelligence and programming

1514
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:39,120
this woman,
um,

1515
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:44,500
this like it's ahead of her wife being
like she married her when she was a man

1516
01:09:44,901 --> 01:09:48,330
and then became a woman.
They stayed together and being a is like

1517
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,190
this,
uh,

1518
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:53,930
artificial intelligence thing that she's
consistently updating as technology gets

1519
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:56,150
better.
She updates it and gives it more and

1520
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:57,830
more intense.
Like if you want to focus on someone

1521
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:01,520
who's a transgender person,
like maybe that would be a good example

1522
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,790
instead of just concentrating on a guy
who used to be really good at running

1523
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,350
and uh,
you know,

1524
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:09,740
and now lived with a bunch of
materialists on a reality show,

1525
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,830
not just running,
but they come and they have no,

1526
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,020
no purpose.
And really.

1527
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:15,710
Yeah,
I mean,

1528
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,660
so now no one's really into the
decathlon.

1529
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,070
Sorry.
I'm sure he's awesome,

1530
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,010
but nobody gives a fuck.
That's why he does any of those sports

1531
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,780
where there's no professional side of
it,

1532
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,990
like it's probably a reason for that.
I say that,

1533
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:28,700
but then that's not true because a
wrestling.

1534
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:32,630
I think wrestling is a great sport.
It doesn't have a professional venue,

1535
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,280
you know,
other than like fake wrestling.

1536
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:38,450
Do you ever think about how weird it is
that people can get invested in like a

1537
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:40,130
team?
Yes.

1538
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,840
Like why?
Why?

1539
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,780
Why do you care so much about your team?
I think about that all the time.

1540
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:46,210
I'm constantly.
Really?

1541
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,300
Yes,
all the time.

1542
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,610
We talk about it all the time.
It's a tribal thing.

1543
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:52,880
People love being in a group.
They like being on team trump.

1544
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,560
They liked being on team hillary,
you know there's there.

1545
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:00,680
I saw I was watching so much tribal
behavior leading down like arguments

1546
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,080
between people on twitter.

1547
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:07,370
It's like you guys are crazy.
Like what are you doing?

1548
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:09,140
You're arguing with people you don't
even know,

1549
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:11,090
and I look at their timeline,
I'll look at the timeline.

1550
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:12,970
They're arguing for seven,
eight hours in a row.

1551
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:17,520
You could be doing so much to improve
your life instead of like insulting.

1552
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:19,860
Hillary supporters are insulting trump
supporters.

1553
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:20,983
They're all,
it's,

1554
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:26,230
it says weird natural thing.
People joined teams that joined tribes.

1555
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:29,820
They have groups that they like,
but it makes sense when you're looking

1556
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:33,750
at say your ethnicity because probably
biologically we're,

1557
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,110
we're primed to prefer it.
Whatever it looks like us,

1558
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,510
you know,
just just naturally primed for that.

1559
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,420
Do you think that's true?
Explain black eyes and asian chicks

1560
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:43,254
ready.
Go.

1561
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,960
I'm done.
So,

1562
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:52,270
but in general
anyway,

1563
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:55,110
so,
but so it makes sense if you're looking

1564
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:57,630
at like big groups or a country or
something,

1565
01:11:57,631 --> 01:12:02,631
but a sports team as such,
a random collection of rules that,

1566
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:04,650
why you could be emotionally invested in
that.

1567
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,900
I've tried because it seems like such
cheap entertainment.

1568
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:08,230
Well,
I want to.

1569
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:11,040
You live a wonderful life,
Scott Adams and you're wealthy.

1570
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:13,150
Successful man.
And uh,

1571
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,850
for some people there's not a whole lot
to look forward to it.

1572
01:12:16,851 --> 01:12:20,010
And this is not.
Obviously I'm not using a broad blanket

1573
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:23,700
to paint all sports fans,
but I think that there's a lot of people

1574
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:28,020
out there that look to the success of
their team and they get happiness or

1575
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:30,210
sadness from that and if you're in a
team,

1576
01:12:30,211 --> 01:12:34,260
like if you're in cleveland and they
kick ass and win the world title,

1577
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,900
I mean they have the world heavyweight
champion of the ufc lives in cleveland

1578
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:39,060
too.
Like you get some cleveland pride,

1579
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:43,470
you know,
well that almost works until you

1580
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,500
consider that there are like raiders
fans,

1581
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:50,520
like they just keep losing and losing
raiders is a different thing and they

1582
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:53,820
got to be thinking this will not make me
feel good at the end of the year.

1583
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,320
He.
But raiders is like,

1584
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:58,530
I'm a bad ass.
Raters is a weird one because raiders is

1585
01:12:58,531 --> 01:13:00,450
like rap music.
I'm a thug,

1586
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,710
you know,
I don't give a fuck.

1587
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,720
I'm a raiders fan.
It's a different thing.

1588
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:05,820
Raiders is a,
that's a whole different animal.

1589
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,270
And then the cubs fan cubs fans up until
this year,

1590
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,730
we're like the loyal we,
hey,

1591
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:14,430
I'm not really in it for the winds.
I just love the cubs.

1592
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,110
Meanwhile,
the cubs are new every year.

1593
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:18,210
It's a different fucking person.
Yeah,

1594
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:20,400
that's what's crazy.
It's a totally different group of

1595
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:22,590
humans.
Then the cubs from five years ago,

1596
01:13:22,591 --> 01:13:25,490
how could you love the cubs?
These aren't the same people and then

1597
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,620
the team can just go to another town.
It's not.

1598
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,130
Yeah,
it's fucking nuts.

1599
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:31,080
Like the la rams.
How do we get the rams?

1600
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:32,580
What the fuck happened?
What are we doing here?

1601
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,320
You know,
like,

1602
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,730
and then what's going to happen to the
raiders are going to go to vegas now.

1603
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,670
Then the raiders fans going to follow
them over to vegas.

1604
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,260
You know?
Sometimes they don't.

1605
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:43,320
Sometimes people get mad.
Teams leave and they get pissed off.

1606
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:45,440
Vegas seems like a good fit though,
doesn't it?

1607
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,300
Yeah,
but he was all created because,

1608
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,760
I mean,
all sports teams in this country

1609
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:55,790
essentially were a response to war being
over and people thinking with real good

1610
01:13:58,531 --> 01:14:03,531
reason that men at least need war.
They need some form of war to develop

1611
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:10,131
character and to,
to build strong like strong definitive

1612
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:14,290
nations almost need to unite and bond
with war.

1613
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,660
And the concept was like,
well,

1614
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:19,450
if we can't do that,
let's figure out some sort of a game

1615
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,710
that they can play.
And that's where football emerge.

1616
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,440
Do you think that was conscious or
unconscious?

1617
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,090
Yeah,
no,

1618
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:25,511
it was,
yeah,

1619
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:28,960
it was actually discussed like it's been
discussed and there's been a lot of

1620
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:33,490
historians that have concentrated on
leaders that have talked about the

1621
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:37,000
importance of conflict,
the importance of war in the,

1622
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,863
um,
the,

1623
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,540
the bringing the country together and
uh,

1624
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:44,890
the support of nationalism,
the supportive loyalty and honor and

1625
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:46,030
pride.
Like all of that.

1626
01:14:46,031 --> 01:14:49,280
A lot of it has to be connected with
consequence and loss.

1627
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:50,920
Hmm.
Yeah.

1628
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,440
I like that line of thinking.
well,

1629
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:57,910
there was a radio lab podcast about when
they invented football that went into

1630
01:14:57,911 --> 01:14:59,500
this and pretty,
pretty much in depth.

1631
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,130
God dammit,
I think it was radio lab,

1632
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,530
I'm pretty sure it was.
It was either,

1633
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,050
I don't know how else it could have
been,

1634
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:09,820
but it went into it pretty,
pretty in depth about the creation of

1635
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:12,040
football and how it was originally put
together.

1636
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:17,490
So that would explain why sports that
are just clearly dangerous or it's still

1637
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:20,570
illegal and popular.
And.

1638
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,090
Is that a jamie?
Yeah,

1639
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:23,710
that's it.
American football.

1640
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:24,840
Yeah.
Cv.

1641
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,500
Make that a little larger for my shitty
eyes.

1642
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:28,930
Scroll up there.
Yeah.

1643
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:29,561
Okay.
18,

1644
01:15:29,561 --> 01:15:30,760
79.
Yeah,

1645
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:32,800
that's right.
It was made in the carlisle indian

1646
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:35,420
school formed in 18,
79 to assimilate children.

1647
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:40,390
The grandchildren of native americans
who fought in the plains wars fields.

1648
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:41,950
The most american team of all.
Yeah.

1649
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:46,290
This was about these american indians
that were fucking kicking ass playing

1650
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:47,810
football.
There was another.

1651
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:51,190
There was another one that was about the
ghost of football past.

1652
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:52,160
That could be what?
Hm.

1653
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:55,570
Maybe this was the one that was about
this american indian team that was

1654
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:59,620
really interesting.
So football was invented by native

1655
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:00,371
americans.
No,

1656
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:00,671
no,
no,

1657
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:02,440
no.
There's just one bad ass team.

1658
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,500
Here it is right here.
And to the 19th century,

1659
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:07,510
the civil war was over.
Frontier was dead.

1660
01:16:07,511 --> 01:16:08,770
Young college,
better anxious.

1661
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:10,900
This is what great struggle with test
their character.

1662
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,120
That along comes a new craze.
Football,

1663
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,630
a brutally violent game where young men
show a stadium full of fans,

1664
01:16:16,631 --> 01:16:17,860
just what they're made of.
Harvard,

1665
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:18,581
yale,
princeton,

1666
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:20,590
penn,
the sons of the most powerful men in the

1667
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:23,650
country are literally knocking
themselves out to win these gladiatorial

1668
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:25,510
battles.
So that's when it came up.

1669
01:16:25,511 --> 01:16:28,480
And then the carlisle indian school,
they were beating the fuck out.

1670
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:29,320
All the white dudes.

1671
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:36,870
Surprise.
Interesting.

1672
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,890
Yeah,
I think.

1673
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:40,980
And then I forget.
I think they all assimilated.

1674
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:45,020
I forget the plot of the rules came
because the indians kept beating every

1675
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,290
to make,
making a new rule and they all right,

1676
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:52,460
going to change this.
Native americans need to make a back.

1677
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:57,220
They had a lot of cool ideas.
I think we fucked them over by giving

1678
01:16:57,221 --> 01:17:00,460
them casinos to other towns.
Vegas,

1679
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,310
I've got a small amount of native
american in me.

1680
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,840
Can you get money?
Not,

1681
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,220
not a profit.
What do you need?

1682
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:09,170
Like 16 percent to get money.
You need like a certain amount you can

1683
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:10,004
get some cash.

1684
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,680
Uh,
I think it's even maybe less than that

1685
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,770
really.
Or to qualify for whatever.

1686
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,440
I'll have To look into that.
It might be the worst thing you can do

1687
01:17:18,441 --> 01:17:21,350
too.
some people just tuck them away and this

1688
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,210
little patch of land isolate them from
everybody else and you know,

1689
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,440
they're watching the rest of the world
changed around them,

1690
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,110
some sort of a strange way and they're
americans,

1691
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:32,600
but they're not.
They're in some sort of a weird

1692
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,230
territory that they have ultimate
control over and then they started

1693
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:38,690
having gambling there and doing whatever
the fuck they want.

1694
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:43,130
Very strange,
but in some ways like what are the

1695
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:45,110
other,
what were the other options at the time?

1696
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,910
Giving them territory.
Probably pretty ugly optimism.

1697
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:50,300
Sure.
It's dark.

1698
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,480
You really stop and think about the
genocide of the native americans in this

1699
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:56,000
country and how that,
how rarely that comes up and there's no

1700
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:56,660
flag.

1701
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,860
Which is really interesting when you,
you know,

1702
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,590
obviously there are some plaques,
are some nations,

1703
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:03,410
but I mean there's no,
no one thing that represents our war

1704
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:04,260
with them.
That's no,

1705
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,160
no offensive symbol other than like a
few sports teams.

1706
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:08,570
Right?
Like the redskins are.

1707
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,550
The braves were both my high school and
college were both the warriors.

1708
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:19,130
Warriors is not specific to a
nationality or ethnicity.

1709
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,390
logo.
Logo was,

1710
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:23,120
you know know.
It's weird man.

1711
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:27,550
It's real weird that the fact that it
was only a couple of hundred years ago

1712
01:18:27,551 --> 01:18:30,990
is really weird.
It's a blink of an eye.

1713
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:33,620
How long do you think people are going
to live now?

1714
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:37,670
It's a good question because I'm
thinking I'm good for 100 at least.

1715
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,140
Oh,
okay.

1716
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:40,400
But you personally?
Yeah,

1717
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:41,660
I think you're probably,
you look healthy,

1718
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:43,940
but a kid born today,
thousand years old.

1719
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,020
It's going to be able to read minds.

1720
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,320
Well,
it depends also upon what it person

1721
01:18:48,321 --> 01:18:51,920
becomes because I have a feeling they're
going to come up with legs that are

1722
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:53,890
artificial,
that work way better than your legs.

1723
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:58,740
Like I have a bunch of friends that have
like fake hips or fake knees or you

1724
01:18:58,741 --> 01:19:00,290
know,
they've had surgery and they had a bunch

1725
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:03,350
of stuff fixed.
I know a lot of people that have had hip

1726
01:19:03,351 --> 01:19:04,970
replacements,
like maybe a dozen.

1727
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:10,270
So I've figured out that if I create
enough public information about me,

1728
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:14,120
you know,
there was enough times I'm recorded like

1729
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:15,800
I'm being right now.
Uh,

1730
01:19:15,801 --> 01:19:20,750
enough of my writing is in the public.
There's no video of me that after I die

1731
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:25,670
I could be recreated and software almost
in full because you would have my,

1732
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:29,750
everything from my personality,
my sense of humor,

1733
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:33,980
my choice of words.
So some future program could just go to

1734
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:37,010
the internet,
google my name and take all those

1735
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:42,011
sources and bring together an actual
physical hologram that walks and talks

1736
01:19:42,531 --> 01:19:45,140
like me a hundred years after I'm dead.
What jamie,

1737
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:48,710
you were just telling me about some
software that they've developed that you

1738
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:51,880
can take someone's,
someone can say like,

1739
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,710
I could make a statement.
Scott adams is a really cool guy and I

1740
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:58,760
always love hanging out with them and
they can move the words all over the

1741
01:19:58,761 --> 01:20:01,910
place was where it's a jumbled sentence
that it doesn't make any sense.

1742
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:04,340
And then change the inflection and it
sounds perfect.

1743
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,121
Like,
listen to this.

1744
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:08,060
We'll play some of it here called I'll
see if

1745
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:08,893
I can get

1746
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,090
and,
and,

1747
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:12,550
uh,
uh,

1748
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,250
I kiss my wife and my dogs

1749
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,120
other dogs.
Okay.

1750
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:25,800
How can we let the dogs out who,
who mIght not be a great example of it

1751
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:26,550
was terrible.

1752
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:27,810
Yeah.
It's like a five minute video where they

1753
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:30,630
just think he's called like photoshop
for audio.

1754
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,350
Oh,
okay.

1755
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:35,220
Like it's manipulating audio in a way
that people aren't used to or I've even

1756
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:38,700
seen up until they've just shown this
kind of demonstration.

1757
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,870
So the point being,
if you could automate this,

1758
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,960
if you could put this inside some sort
of an artificial intelligence structure

1759
01:20:43,961 --> 01:20:48,961
that kneW when to inflect,
when to have a question when to like,

1760
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:51,460
or maybe you will be a tech guy and
talking up,

1761
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:53,280
speak up.
Speak is right.

1762
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:58,090
I love up speak because it's so fuck it.
It's this weird thing that these tech

1763
01:20:58,091 --> 01:21:01,420
dorks do where they sort of talk in this
really weird,

1764
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,740
unpredictable way and they all do it and
basically it makes you seem like you're

1765
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:09,850
sensitive and intelligent and on the
ball and it's a weird fucking little

1766
01:21:09,851 --> 01:21:14,020
sneaky thing that some of these tech
guys do where it takes you a while to

1767
01:21:14,021 --> 01:21:14,441
go,
oh,

1768
01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:16,780
you're not smart at all.
You're fucking crazy.

1769
01:21:16,781 --> 01:21:18,850
But you talk in ups speak,
you know,

1770
01:21:18,851 --> 01:21:21,880
they've,
they've decided to take on the persona

1771
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,140
of a tech person.

1772
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:26,350
Somebody is really into,
I believe in android,

1773
01:21:26,351 --> 01:21:28,630
android's the future and they,
they start,

1774
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,900
they have this weird thing that they do
at the end of each sentence.

1775
01:21:31,901 --> 01:21:34,720
They go up.
I'm not sure that exists outside of

1776
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,660
Virginia or California,
silicone valley.

1777
01:21:37,661 --> 01:21:39,850
It's huge in silicone valley.
I think it's more,

1778
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:43,120
it's more prevalent in northern
California that it is in southern

1779
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:46,390
California.
It's almost like they're halfway like an

1780
01:21:46,391 --> 01:21:51,391
npr sort of a radio personality halfway
that and halfway a strip club dj.

1781
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,890
It's like they have this thing going on
where it's a fake voice and they're

1782
01:21:56,891 --> 01:21:59,050
talking about technology.
That's all.

1783
01:21:59,051 --> 01:22:01,060
I'm going to here now.
Now I'm going to hear that.

1784
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,650
Oh,
you'll hear it.

1785
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,080
I'll,
I'll,

1786
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,770
I'll give you some audio of people.
There's a bunch of people that they

1787
01:22:05,771 --> 01:22:09,340
speak and it is an accent.
The same way in New York accent or a

1788
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,890
boston accent is like you can recognize,
oh,

1789
01:22:11,891 --> 01:22:13,030
that's a tech dork.

1790
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:17,420
Like it's a non original tech person
who's speaking in this weird there.

1791
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:20,140
You want people to understand that
you're a tech person,

1792
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:23,980
so you're speaking in a literally a tech
accent,

1793
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:28,600
up speak.
I might try that and it's really

1794
01:22:28,601 --> 01:22:31,230
fascinating.
Women can do it too.

1795
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:34,210
It's super important.
You know,

1796
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:37,690
like there's a,
almost a woman up speak that you'll see

1797
01:22:37,691 --> 01:22:42,190
occasionally on daytime talk shows where
like a bunch of women will sit around

1798
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,340
and they'll be on a show and the woman
or it's all audience,

1799
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,630
the wwe women's.
Um,

1800
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,990
the audience is all women and there's
all women on the panel and then they're

1801
01:22:49,991 --> 01:22:54,880
cooking or they're talking about clothes
and what the woman's up speak.

1802
01:22:54,881 --> 01:22:58,840
His sentences don't end.
They just sort of stopped talking.

1803
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:03,010
Do you ever notice somebody who didn't
have any way to end a story?

1804
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:03,760
Yes,
they would.

1805
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,590
They would talk forever.
They keep going.

1806
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:05,980
And then

1807
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,850
during the time of a early cell phones
when one person was talking,

1808
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:12,790
the other person couldn't talk because
you didn't realize it all the time,

1809
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:17,230
but it really was one way communication.
And somebody would start and I would

1810
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:20,110
start yelling into the phone,
stop stopped.

1811
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:22,120
Okay,
bang,

1812
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:22,661
bang,
bang.

1813
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:24,040
You know,
let me in,

1814
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,190
let me in.
Well,

1815
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,310
with what I mean by sentences don't ever
end.

1816
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:30,850
It's not that they don't stop talking,
but that they don't have it.

1817
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:33,130
Like if I said to you,
hey scott,

1818
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:35,920
it's 3:00,
we should probably wrap this up in about

1819
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,510
an hour.
Instead of that,

1820
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:38,800
they would say,
hey scott,

1821
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:41,560
it's 3:00.
we should probably wrap this up in about

1822
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,200
an hour and um,
and then just keep going and then

1823
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:46,690
someone else chimes in.
What about 4:00?

1824
01:23:46,691 --> 01:23:49,600
It's 4:00 a good time.
Four o'clock is a good time.

1825
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:52,330
Five o'clock is a good time.
Six o'clock is a good time.

1826
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:55,540
what about seven?
Can we do it at seven slash 11 is fine.

1827
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:59,590
We can definitely keep going and there's
no end.

1828
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,810
There's no.
This is my laptop.

1829
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:04,600
My laptop is black.
Do they hear it themselves?

1830
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,150
They love it.
They love to talk to get together.

1831
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,040
Do you think,
do you think that if you meet somebody

1832
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:12,520
who has heard this podcast and they talk
like that normally,

1833
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,240
would they be unable to talk to,
you know,

1834
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:16,990
it'd be to self coach now.
They'd be fine,

1835
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,330
they'd say he's a dick.
And also

1836
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,720
I think that's what he said,
dick.

1837
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:23,840
Um,
it's,

1838
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,900
I didn't give the best example of it
either,

1839
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,330
but yeah,
I think what it is,

1840
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:29,680
is that's how they enjoy talking.
I think they're,

1841
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:32,950
they've had to edit their conversations
because men get tired quicker.

1842
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,170
We just don't want to talk as much about
certain stuff.

1843
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,490
Like we'd be like,
jesus christ,

1844
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:38,590
get on with the story,
finish it.

1845
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,200
When does the story end?
But women get together.

1846
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,300
They love it.
They can just keep going.

1847
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,310
a lot of them can you reminded me of
the,

1848
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:49,030
the worst advice anybody ever gave his
be natural.

1849
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:52,390
Be yourself because what the hell does
that mean?

1850
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,580
Who are you?
If I were myself,

1851
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:55,530
I'd be like,
you know,

1852
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,270
sitting here and make it masturbating
and really,

1853
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,220
well maybe not right here,
but yeah,

1854
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:04,290
that was a terrible example.
Sometimes let's go back,

1855
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:07,390
get rid of that.
So that would be used sometimes.

1856
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:08,253
right?
And that's,

1857
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:11,500
that is yourself,
but it's like yourself varies depending

1858
01:25:11,501 --> 01:25:13,870
upon your company,
depending upon the environment,

1859
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:17,080
depending upon the circumstances were
all acting all the time.

1860
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,390
We're,
we're adapting to every Situation.

1861
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,340
Yeah,
and you and you also want to be

1862
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:23,740
different sometimes,
so it's not even necessarily an act.

1863
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:24,761
It's like,
you know,

1864
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:25,521
someone says,
hey,

1865
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:26,231
he's got,
show me.

1866
01:25:26,231 --> 01:25:28,000
Show me that fucking crazy handstand.
You did.

1867
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:30,250
Like,
it really does not me right now.

1868
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:31,820
Right,
right.

1869
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,940
Yeah,
but we're always adapting to the

1870
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:34,990
situation.
Yeah.

1871
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:36,730
But there's women that are like men too
in that way.

1872
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,670
The women want other women to shut the
fuck up and they want men to shut the

1873
01:25:39,671 --> 01:25:41,740
fuck up to like I like got damaged
people.

1874
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:44,770
They're long ass boring stories.
It's not necessarily genDer specific,

1875
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,970
but it seems to be like women on talk
shows during the day that are Cooking.

1876
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:54,610
Do you ever have people who can't tell
when they've gone on too long?

1877
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,200
Yes.
Maybe me right there.

1878
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:02,350
And you look at them and you think,
do they not know?

1879
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,980
I'm giving the signals

1880
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,440
of stop.
you know,

1881
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:09,320
in the corporate world,
you know you always have a pen in your

1882
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:11,180
hand.
If Somebody came into your cubicle and

1883
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:14,580
you wanted to leave,
you wouldn't put the pen down so you

1884
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,330
turn toward them,
but you keep the pen in your hand to

1885
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:19,830
signal them that you're there for them,
you know,

1886
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:21,680
you'd put it down and you turn toward
them.

1887
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:24,350
But if you,
if you turn to but just the pen and I'd

1888
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:25,460
be like,
dude,

1889
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,920
the pan,
you do not see,

1890
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:29,150
this patent is still in my hand.

1891
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:30,530
There's a weird thing that people will
do to you.

1892
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:32,900
If you're on the phone while you're on
your cell phone,

1893
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:37,010
they will come up to you because you're,
the physical presence trumps whatever

1894
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:39,380
you're.
Whatever you got going on digitally,

1895
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,000
right?
So like you're on the phone.

1896
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:43,070
You might be having a really important
conversation and someone go,

1897
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:44,210
hey man,
Scott Adams.

1898
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,350
Hey,
how you doIng man?

1899
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,273
And you're like,
hey,

1900
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,240
I'm the phone.
Hey,

1901
01:26:47,241 --> 01:26:48,530
I just want to tell you I really love
dealer.

1902
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,760
Why white still talking?
You?

1903
01:26:49,761 --> 01:26:51,320
Fuck,
you know,

1904
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:52,940
I'm in the middle of another
conversation.

1905
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,680
You've decided this person isn't here.
Fuck them.

1906
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,330
You said,
I want your attention.

1907
01:26:56,331 --> 01:26:57,500
I'm right in front of you.
I can touch you,

1908
01:26:57,501 --> 01:26:59,390
Scott Adams.
Dilbert's my hero.

1909
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:01,670
I love you and behold,
juror shoulder,

1910
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,300
but you know,
you,

1911
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,360
you,
you get the,

1912
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,390
you get the celebrity thing that I don't
get because I'm invisible.

1913
01:27:06,450 --> 01:27:07,283
Like your visual,

1914
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:09,120
you're visual.
You're on periscope.

1915
01:27:09,121 --> 01:27:10,400
I knew exactly what you look like.
Oh,

1916
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,480
you wouldn't?
7,000 people on earth.

1917
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,433
Uh,
it's,

1918
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,660
I think it's more,
I think their shadow banning you.

1919
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,780
Uh,
I like that term

1920
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:22,050
that we were talking about that the
other day,

1921
01:27:22,051 --> 01:27:24,270
hillary for prison.
Remember when we were saying rape?

1922
01:27:24,271 --> 01:27:26,970
Melania was actually a hashtag,
but hillary for prison wasn't.

1923
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,060
That's not what people were saying was
people were saying was they were shadow

1924
01:27:30,061 --> 01:27:34,920
banning that hillary for prison.
Hashtag meaning if You put hashtag

1925
01:27:34,921 --> 01:27:37,080
hillary for prison,
someone could search it and find it,

1926
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,420
but if you put it,
it wouldn't show up in other people's

1927
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:41,220
feeds.
I don't know if that's true though.

1928
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,540
Has that been proven?

1929
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:45,990
I,
I'm having a real tough time with what's

1930
01:27:45,991 --> 01:27:49,680
proven because lots of people are
sending me my own stuff and saying,

1931
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,960
here's proof that you have been shadow
banned because look at this page and

1932
01:27:52,961 --> 01:27:55,530
then compare it to this page,
and I always look at them and I go,

1933
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,400
I'm not really a lawyer.
I,

1934
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:58,390
I can't tell

1935
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:00,540
how you find out.
Very simple reason.

1936
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:01,860
You're wealthy,
man.

1937
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,530
You have two laptops.
You make a second twitter account.

1938
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:07,890
Don't use it for nefarious reasons.
Don't get on and start shitting on

1939
01:28:07,891 --> 01:28:10,620
people under 59 or whatever the fuck you
call it,

1940
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:13,170
but you start a laptop,
you follow you,

1941
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:15,960
you follow a few other people just for a
goof,

1942
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,700
and then you sit there and you watch
your timeline.

1943
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,211
Well,
no,

1944
01:28:18,211 --> 01:28:20,880
I,
I do know that people are not getting my

1945
01:28:20,881 --> 01:28:21,250
stuff.
Yeah,

1946
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,200
but here's the thing.
You could find out yourself.

1947
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:27,340
You could tweet from another computer as
scott adam says,

1948
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:28,211
so you do.
Scott.

1949
01:28:28,211 --> 01:28:32,290
Adam says you're followIng you on
another computer that's in a different

1950
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:34,840
account and you're such,
but have you done that?

1951
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:36,850
No,
but I'm saying that other people have

1952
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:38,830
done that and they sent me the
screenshot,

1953
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,270
but when I look at her crazy,
they just want to talk to you,

1954
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:42,530
scott.
They want to be your friend.

1955
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,040
They want to talk to you when you're on
your cell phone.

1956
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:45,110
Hey man,
I love gilbert.

1957
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,120
Who he talked to.
You don't fuck it.

1958
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:47,954
I'm right here,
man.

1959
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,240
Why don't you try it yourself?

1960
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,450
Um,
I guess I wasn't that curious.

1961
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,050
Come on and he talked about it.
You have to be curious.

1962
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,020
I kind of liked being shadow banned.
Do you like being shadow banned or you

1963
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:01,830
liked the idea of you being shadow
bands?

1964
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:04,370
I liked that definitive proof that your
shadow bands I liked,

1965
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,820
I liked the thought that I might be so
dangerous to the minds of America that

1966
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:13,380
there's a major corporation who is
actually making a conscious decision to

1967
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:17,130
say who the americas had a little bit
too much of this guy.

1968
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:21,180
So let's dial it back a little bit.
Well of like that if twitter didn't have

1969
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:25,440
a history of banning people,
you know,

1970
01:29:25,441 --> 01:29:27,690
like the milo thing,
milo yiannopoulos,

1971
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:32,430
that was a big mistake,
big mistake because they didn't ban them

1972
01:29:32,431 --> 01:29:34,590
for anything that like you could like
put your finger on.

1973
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:37,920
TheY banned them for influence and other
people were saying mean things,

1974
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:39,690
but you looked at the stuff that he
actually said,

1975
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:41,400
man,
you can't ban them for that.

1976
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,200
That's just not,
that's not fair.

1977
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,660
Well,
certainly not compared to everything

1978
01:29:45,661 --> 01:29:48,060
else that's on twitter,
not even compared to the things that

1979
01:29:48,061 --> 01:29:50,100
leslie jones wrote,
you know,

1980
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:51,210
I mean,
the,

1981
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:56,100
the person that he was supposedly
attacking and what he was doing was he

1982
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:59,280
was targeting a piece of art and he
critiqued it very harshly,

1983
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:04,380
but that's what he does and he's very
wise with his choice of words is very

1984
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:08,070
snippy and bitchy and that's his persona
and that's what he's put together.

1985
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,190
He's a lovely guy.
Like I've had them on the podcast a

1986
01:30:11,191 --> 01:30:12,600
couple of times.
I enjoy his company.

1987
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:14,900
He's a fun guy,
but god damned.

1988
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:18,090
People get pissed off and then it's kind
of hilarious.

1989
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:20,970
And so when that whole thing went down
with the leslie jones things,

1990
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:24,760
and I've absolutely didn't agree with
all the people that were being mean

1991
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:28,380
insulting to leslie,
but that's kind of what happens if you

1992
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,090
put yourself out there with a piece of
art,

1993
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,560
right,
that people don't like.

1994
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:35,040
And all he did was saY that they were
all ugly,

1995
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,890
you know,
he was saying that it's a bad feminist

1996
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:41,640
film because all the men are buffoons
and all the women are saving the world.

1997
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,230
And he's like,
it's preposterous.

1998
01:30:43,231 --> 01:30:44,670
It's sucks,
it's not good.

1999
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:47,400
And the women are all gross.
And that's what he said and you know,

2000
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,610
for that was that the last part was all
the trouble.

2001
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:52,080
Well it was,
I mean,

2002
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:53,820
the fact that he was saying they're
unattractive.

2003
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:56,070
He was saying that not just to be
bitchy,

2004
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:58,650
but also at a point it was like he,
he made a point,

2005
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:01,290
he's like,
they've decided lee picked people that

2006
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:05,400
were unattractive to make this sort of
feminist point of these overweight women

2007
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:08,180
can save the world.
That they're the ones who are gonna like

2008
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:11,010
they're targeting.
And that's why all the men are buffoons.

2009
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:14,370
it's sort of revenge,
like the idea being,

2010
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:17,550
if you wanted to look at it broadly,
the idea being that these are the type

2011
01:31:17,551 --> 01:31:19,890
of women that the guy like the thor
dude,

2012
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:20,724
what's his name?

2013
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:23,080
the guy who was in that movie,
that really handsome fellow that plays

2014
01:31:23,081 --> 01:31:25,530
thor,
chris quits name.

2015
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,250
Now chris is super spy.
Captain american to see liam hemsworth.

2016
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,560
Is that the grams worth comes worth
chris hemsworth,

2017
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:32,490
right?
It's one of them.

2018
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,990
Am I right?
Or is it chris?

2019
01:31:33,991 --> 01:31:36,750
The guy who plays captain America
hemsworth.

2020
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,210
Let's just call them thor.
Okay.

2021
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,560
Doors impossibly beautiful.
It's beautiful man.

2022
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:43,800
It's super handsome.
Big fucking perfect body.

2023
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:46,650
And of course in this movie,
he's a fucking moron.

2024
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,500
I mean he is the dumbest guy that's ever
walked the face of the planet.

2025
01:31:49,501 --> 01:31:52,530
He's preposterously dm and then becomes
the villain at the end.

2026
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:57,740
So he represents this unattainable goal
of like a having this gigantic beautiful

2027
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:01,990
man be attracted to you.
So they've turned him in this complete

2028
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:05,200
retard.
Like if this was a woman in a movie,

2029
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:07,660
it would be one of the most offensive
portrayals of a woman ever.

2030
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,940
And I'm sure it's been done.
I'm sure it's been done right.

2031
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:12,040
Especially like in the old days.
I mean,

2032
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:15,160
there was how many fucking dopey
secretary roles were there in the world,

2033
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:18,490
right?
so he was that the male caricature of

2034
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,830
that.
But there's not a single other male in

2035
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:22,960
the movie that wasn't a complete
buffoon.

2036
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:26,800
Every male iS a failure and ultimately
gets killed and dies.

2037
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,980
Every woman's saves the day.
And this was my lowest point.

2038
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:34,900
So in most forms of entertainment you
need the dumb one and the smart one,

2039
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:35,920
you know,
there's always going to be that

2040
01:32:35,921 --> 01:32:36,754
contract.
Sure.

2041
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:41,910
And in earlier times there were other
people you could poke fun at and society

2042
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:42,701
would say,
oh yeah,

2043
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:43,960
we make fun of that.
And you know,

2044
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:44,630
the,
the,

2045
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:49,630
the wife was the dumb one in the fifties
and now some of it is just what target

2046
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:53,730
can you get away with?
So there's,

2047
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:55,180
there's a little bit of that.
It's like,

2048
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,600
you know who's a soft target,
nobody's going to complain and men are

2049
01:32:58,601 --> 01:32:59,220
the,
you know,

2050
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,840
the current target.
If you look at commercials,

2051
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:07,180
almost all the commercials are.
The woman is the smart one in the man.

2052
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:09,010
Did something stupid that she had to fix
it.

2053
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:10,810
Every sitcom,
every sitcom.

2054
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:11,990
But I mean,
even in the fifties,

2055
01:33:11,991 --> 01:33:16,100
that was the case like the honeymooners.
Ralph kramden was a fucking moron.

2056
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:18,080
His wife has one is always keeping them
calm,

2057
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,210
right?
He was always to the moon.

2058
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,410
Alice,
he's threatening to beat her.

2059
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,030
Right.
And his buddy,

2060
01:33:23,031 --> 01:33:27,200
his buddy was this fucking idiot to.
And his buddy's wife was keeping him in

2061
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:27,870
line.
Yeah.

2062
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:29,330
That was true for the honeymooners.
Yeah.

2063
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:32,240
I mean,
at any couples sort of comedy,

2064
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:35,000
the man is a buffoon.
Married with children.

2065
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:38,860
Pegs always want sex is all fucked up.
He's trying to get away from her.

2066
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:40,940
He hates his life.
Everything falls apart on him.

2067
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:44,150
His daughter's acting like a little
hussy,

2068
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,920
right?
I mean that's the whole thing.

2069
01:33:45,921 --> 01:33:47,540
This poor guy,
his life's falling apart.

2070
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,310
The guys never.
Okay.

2071
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:52,130
All those movies,
that guy's a buffoon and all those

2072
01:33:52,131 --> 01:33:53,420
sitcoms.
That guy's a buffoon.

2073
01:33:53,421 --> 01:33:54,530
That's what people like to see.

2074
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:57,160
Yeah.
But you know,

2075
01:33:57,161 --> 01:34:00,760
I'm looking at elvis right behind you.
Let's different animal baby.

2076
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,180
Yeah.
come on in.

2077
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:03,880
So there were a lot of movies where it
was,

2078
01:34:03,881 --> 01:34:05,290
you know,
frank sinatra,

2079
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,780
charles bronson,
maybe you have to go back further where,

2080
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,530
where the man was the competent one and
the woman was always losing her high

2081
01:34:11,531 --> 01:34:12,341
hill.
OH,

2082
01:34:12,341 --> 01:34:15,940
there's plenty of movies like that.
But in sitcoms and the sitcom world and

2083
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:17,880
the comedy world,
it's pretty much always the men's.

2084
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:19,420
A man's phone.
Yeah.

2085
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:22,120
I think that's fair to say for a lot.
You know,

2086
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:23,500
king of queens.
There's another one,

2087
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:27,040
Kevin James is always ridiculous.
His wife always had to figure everything

2088
01:34:27,041 --> 01:34:28,420
out.
He Was ridiculous.

2089
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,380
But how did you get this hot wife?
She's on tv.

2090
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:37,060
I mean,
this is a.

2091
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,700
I mean,
we're going back to the twitter thing.

2092
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,010
This is the problem with censoring
people,

2093
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:44,740
uh,
Is that if you don't like what they

2094
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:45,880
stand for,
you know,

2095
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:49,210
you're not really,
like they were looking for the reason to

2096
01:34:49,211 --> 01:34:51,820
pull the plug on him.
It wasn't a good one.

2097
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:56,500
So it left people like what that like
that him saying that.

2098
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,870
And then when you pull up things that
she has said about white people that she

2099
01:34:59,871 --> 01:35:02,430
has said about other ethnicities and
some of the,

2100
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,230
she's like literally said get someone,
like someone tweeted something matter.

2101
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:09,470
She was telling people to get them.
That's like this targeted harassment,

2102
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:11,810
right?
Like that is like actual targeted

2103
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:15,890
harassment and the idea that she's doing
it in revenge for someone coming after

2104
01:35:15,891 --> 01:35:17,150
her.
I understand,

2105
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:21,200
but in the position that she's at,
like she's a huge celebrity for her to

2106
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,390
actively say go get this person.

2107
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:26,600
Like that is the clearest example you're
ever going to see of targeted

2108
01:35:26,601 --> 01:35:29,600
harassment.
So if that doesn't get punished in any

2109
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:30,434
way,
shape or form,

2110
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:33,410
like you got to say,
well why is it because she's female is

2111
01:35:33,411 --> 01:35:35,900
because she's black?
Is it a combination of those things is

2112
01:35:35,901 --> 01:35:40,901
because she represents what you think is
like liberal progressive mindset and

2113
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:45,890
then he represents this all right,
that people are terrified of and hate.

2114
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:49,730
He represents the gamer gate which gave
birth to the alt right,

2115
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:52,250
like gamergate allowed people to realize
like,

2116
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:54,050
hey,
there's actually some intelligent people

2117
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,290
that are tired of all this bullshit that
these feminists are trying to push down

2118
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:00,140
our throats and intelligent people that
are coming together and go,

2119
01:36:00,141 --> 01:36:02,120
no,
laura croft is not the fucking bane of

2120
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:05,350
civilization.
It's fun to watch her run around with

2121
01:36:05,351 --> 01:36:06,230
her tits.
Jiggling,

2122
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,310
shoot guns at things.

2123
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,770
It doesn't mean you hate women just
doesn't.

2124
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,840
You know,
and women were playing that game too anD

2125
01:36:11,841 --> 01:36:16,520
saying the same thing and this portrayal
of these people as being these ugly

2126
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,170
massage.
Just monsters.

2127
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:22,490
The backlash of that is what gave birth
to gamergate and a loT of gamergate was

2128
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,770
harassment,
targeted harassment of women.

2129
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:25,760
Horrible stuff.
Right?

2130
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,940
But I think as you were saying when it
was,

2131
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,420
when you're talking about trump
supporters,

2132
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,390
there's a certain percentage of these
trump supporters that probably are

2133
01:36:32,391 --> 01:36:34,910
racist,
doesn't mean they all are like,

2134
01:36:34,911 --> 01:36:36,350
what is the number?
Is it two percent?

2135
01:36:36,351 --> 01:36:38,360
Is at four percent.
There's a certain percent of the

2136
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:40,910
probably absolute misogynist.
What's that number?

2137
01:36:40,911 --> 01:36:43,340
I don't know what that number is,
but there's also some other people in

2138
01:36:43,341 --> 01:36:45,320
there.
There has to be that a reasonable.

2139
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:48,860
Because if you look at the number of
people that voted for obama and you look

2140
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:50,360
at the number of people that voted for
trump,

2141
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:53,250
a lot of those people at the same people
will actually,

2142
01:36:53,251 --> 01:36:56,070
if you look at romney's vote compared to
trump,

2143
01:36:56,071 --> 01:36:59,490
I think ron,
the trump did better in most ethnic

2144
01:36:59,491 --> 01:37:00,870
groups.
Yes he did.

2145
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,030
Just across the board.
They didn't trust that white dude.

2146
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:04,290
And,
and what was the,

2147
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,500
what was the problem with romney?
He just didn't have the policies they

2148
01:37:07,501 --> 01:37:08,430
wanted to write.
I mean,

2149
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:11,070
it was also the mormon thing.
Well,

2150
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:12,480
yeah,
but it was also the mormon thing.

2151
01:37:12,481 --> 01:37:14,640
But the mormon thing was pretty big,
I think.

2152
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,660
I mean,
he,

2153
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:20,660
he believes one of the wackiest strains
of christianity would even call it

2154
01:37:21,511 --> 01:37:22,530
christianity.
Well,

2155
01:37:22,531 --> 01:37:24,630
we don't know.
We don't know which parts of it.

2156
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:26,190
He believes literally.
Well,

2157
01:37:26,191 --> 01:37:28,920
we know that his dad was actually born
in Mexico.

2158
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:31,020
Do you know the whole story about that?
I don't.

2159
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,000
Oh,
I'm going to school you scott,

2160
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:34,620
because this is wonderful.
Please do.

2161
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,060
Mitt romney comes from a faction of the
mormons that were so hardcore that when

2162
01:37:39,061 --> 01:37:41,740
the United States banned polygamy,
they went,

2163
01:37:41,741 --> 01:37:43,530
we'll fuck this.
We're moving to Mexico.

2164
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:46,650
so they moved to Mexico.
So mitt romney's dad could never be the

2165
01:37:46,651 --> 01:37:49,230
president United States because he was
born in Mexico.

2166
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:53,850
It was a mexican citizen.
They have these giant compounds and they

2167
01:37:53,851 --> 01:37:58,650
have to fight off the drug and there's
more than one gigantic compound owned by

2168
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:03,651
mormons in Mexico.
They literally have carved out their own

2169
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,640
camps down there and they're armed and
they did as vice piece on them where

2170
01:38:08,641 --> 01:38:10,830
they interviewed them and went over
there and talked about it,

2171
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:15,660
and that is the whole reason why mitt
romney's mommy's dad's mexican.

2172
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,820
I mean literally mexican,
born in Mexico,

2173
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:19,940
mexican citizen,
they'll look at that.

2174
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,640
Mitt romney's mexican roots.
His father was born in Mexico and could

2175
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:26,160
choose.
He could choose dual citizenship.

2176
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,390
That is interesting.
Yeah.

2177
01:38:28,391 --> 01:38:31,340
How did I noT know that?
How did you not know that matters?

2178
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:31,891
Anything?
Well,

2179
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:33,510
I'm a.
I'm obsesseD with mormons,

2180
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:37,410
so that's how I found out about it and
obsessed for a long time.

2181
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:41,160
So did you do The deep dive and look at
all this stuff that they believe in?

2182
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:42,120
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2183
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:45,030
The seer stone,
like Joseph Smith in 18,

2184
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:49,260
12 found magic tablets that were the
last work of jesus and only he could

2185
01:38:49,261 --> 01:38:53,160
read him because he had a magic rock and
he was like 14 at the time,

2186
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:56,550
which is fucking hilarious.
All this happened when he was 14.

2187
01:38:56,551 --> 01:39:00,660
This is when he first concocted this
goofy ass story apparently where he

2188
01:39:00,661 --> 01:39:03,150
lived.
It was fairly common for people to come

2189
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:05,940
up with this kind of calm.

2190
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,021
Really?
Yeah.

2191
01:39:07,021 --> 01:39:09,360
I mean it was,
it wasn't like the only one doing this.

2192
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:12,060
It was.
I read that somewhere is just stuck.

2193
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:13,260
Yes.
my sources.

2194
01:39:13,261 --> 01:39:15,780
I read that somewhere and I
misremembered it now,

2195
01:39:15,781 --> 01:39:18,810
so I'll say it in public because that
settles pretty authoritative thing about

2196
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:21,090
mormons though.
They're really nice people.

2197
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:22,530
I really,
I like a lot of mormons.

2198
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:24,240
I'm frienDs with quite a few more
minutes.

2199
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:29,070
I know a bunch of them and like in
general they promote a lot of

2200
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,230
camaraderie,
a loT of community.

2201
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:34,200
They're very friendly.
The people like in the mormon church,

2202
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:36,390
like the friends that I know that are
mormons,

2203
01:39:36,391 --> 01:39:39,240
they go to church on a regular basis and
it's almost like this community

2204
01:39:39,241 --> 01:39:42,660
gathering of super polite people that
agree to be super polite.

2205
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:45,450
I've said the same thing and I don't
know if it's because they don't drink

2206
01:39:45,451 --> 01:39:50,190
and don't have coffee or something,
but I don't think I've ever met a

2207
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:51,600
mormon,
but I didn't really like.

2208
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,820
they're nice people.
They just all seem great.

2209
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,290
Just almost like it's okay to believe
wacky shit if it works for you.

2210
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,930
I've never met one that really believed
the,

2211
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,490
you know,
the deeper stuff.

2212
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,640
Oh my friends wear the underwear.
Seriously.

2213
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,440
Yeah.
They have to wear the underwear,

2214
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,570
but that's not a belief so much as a
customer,

2215
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:11,280
wouldn't you say?
Yeah.

2216
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,810
Well they're a little hypocritical,
right?

2217
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:15,450
Like you're not allowed to drink coffee.
so this do drinks,

2218
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:16,800
energy drinks,
monsters,

2219
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:20,610
those giant ones.
He pounds those things and you know,

2220
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:23,340
you're not supposed to do drugs,
but you can get away with it.

2221
01:40:23,341 --> 01:40:25,710
If the doctor prescribes the xanax,
you're allowed to take that

2222
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:29,640
because it's not in.
It's not any of their books.

2223
01:40:29,641 --> 01:40:32,730
They didn't have xanax.
Xanax is a loophole.

2224
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:34,500
You just can't.
You can't pound booze.

2225
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,290
So he just fucking pop pills and freak
out all day.

2226
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:40,440
That was a good compromise.
That's a good.

2227
01:40:40,441 --> 01:40:41,550
Religion is flexible.
Well,

2228
01:40:41,551 --> 01:40:44,010
they're nice people.
They're really nice people like,

2229
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:45,750
um,
I'm a fan of the mormon people.

2230
01:40:45,751 --> 01:40:48,240
Like in general,
I think what they believe is nonsense,

2231
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:50,400
but maybe they don't really believe
that.

2232
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:53,980
Maybe you're right.
I said that I've talked to one who

2233
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:58,450
actually believed the,
the stuff that's just be.

2234
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:02,410
They enjoy the community aspect of it
and the bonding of it and they believe

2235
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:05,290
in god and maybe they just let all that
other stuff slide.

2236
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:08,170
That's totally possible.
That feels like it.

2237
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,770
I mean,
I don't know if it feels like,

2238
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:10,361
you know,
if they die,

2239
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:13,990
they get their own planet.
That is a perk.

2240
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,730
You get a whole planet.
You know what?

2241
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:17,620
I die if I die.
You know what?

2242
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:20,030
I get what she had.
Dude,

2243
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,370
that's not true.
I decomposed.

2244
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,580
I'm going to get you in tight with the
mormons and you're going to get a planet

2245
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,443
because I like you.

2246
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,550
If you're seeing the osman brothers,
um,

2247
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:29,140
album where they,
uh,

2248
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:33,490
they all have.
It's named after the planet that you

2249
01:41:33,491 --> 01:41:36,280
get.
What the fuck is the or named after

2250
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:39,400
this,
this thing that they believe that makes

2251
01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:42,040
you get all these planets like this
place that you go,

2252
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,830
you get your own planet.
But in the osman album,

2253
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:46,990
the osbourne family album,
whenever the fuck it is,

2254
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:51,070
they all have like their own little
planets and it's inside like the album

2255
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,470
jacket,
like he opened it up.

2256
01:41:52,471 --> 01:41:54,940
There's like planets.
It's hilarious.

2257
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,800
It's really fun,
but again,

2258
01:41:56,801 --> 01:41:58,780
perfect example,
Donny osmond and marie osmond,

2259
01:41:58,781 --> 01:41:59,920
very nice people.
Uh,

2260
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:03,940
I'm going to shop around for new
religion because They'll have different

2261
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,050
afterlives and I think you have to
compare them to do because the planet

2262
01:42:08,051 --> 01:42:10,000
thing is due.
So it was pretty appealing.

2263
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:15,270
Well a may imagine if we go back to your
original idea that this is some sort of

2264
01:42:15,801 --> 01:42:19,270
a software simulation and that's why
your memories are so wacky and nothing

2265
01:42:19,271 --> 01:42:24,271
sticks and imagine if you literally are
choosing by virtue of your decision to

2266
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:28,840
join a certain religion,
what your afterlife will be like if

2267
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:31,420
you're in a video game and there's like
a bunch of different doors you have to

2268
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:34,210
figure out which one's the right door to
go through and you go through that door.

2269
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:38,590
It's a totally different adventure.
What if we really are a software

2270
01:42:38,591 --> 01:42:42,610
simulation and just like you say,
the software allows you to pick an

2271
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:46,150
afterlife and you do actually.
I mean that's what you're actually

2272
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:49,810
experiencing because for software that
would be totally practical if we're

2273
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:51,700
software that would be totally
practical.

2274
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:57,220
And that simulation theory thing is a
mindfuck because you don't know what

2275
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:58,900
we're talking about.
Here's the rub.

2276
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:04,270
The rub is one day without a doubt,
if we continue,

2277
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:07,870
if we don't get hit by an asteroid,
if we don't get swallowed up in a super

2278
01:43:07,871 --> 01:43:10,480
volcano or a tsunami or an earthquake or
something crazy,

2279
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:15,670
human beings will reach a point where if
you look at the exponential growth of

2280
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:18,490
technology,
we are going to be able to create an

2281
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:22,270
artificial reality that is
indistinguishable from regular reality.

2282
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:25,420
If that's the case,
how will we know if we're in it?

2283
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,780
We won't.
So how do we know if we're not in it

2284
01:43:28,781 --> 01:43:30,870
right now?
I'll take the math one.

2285
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,870
One step further is that by the time
there's one of those,

2286
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:38,740
if it's a perfect simulation,
the simulation will create another

2287
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:41,770
simulation and so on.
So it's turtles all the way down.

2288
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,200
So then,
so this is actually what the scientists,

2289
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:49,290
they say that the number of original
species will be one and the number of

2290
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:53,210
copies will eventually be gigantic.
You know,

2291
01:43:53,211 --> 01:43:54,380
it could be thousands,
millions,

2292
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:56,810
trillions.
So the odds that you're the original

2293
01:43:56,811 --> 01:43:57,770
copy,
you know,

2294
01:43:57,771 --> 01:44:02,771
the original might be one in a trillion
if that's a real,

2295
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:07,790
that's the big f,
but it's an f tHat if not possible now

2296
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:11,600
or if not reality will one day be.
Yeah,

2297
01:44:11,601 --> 01:44:14,600
we can't tell where we are in the cycle.
If we're,

2298
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:18,440
if we're a simulation,
we don't know if there were hundreds of

2299
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:19,640
simulations before us.

2300
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:20,850
There's no way to know.
Well,

2301
01:44:20,851 --> 01:44:24,830
there's also the very slippery aspect of
consciousness where we shut it off every

2302
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:28,400
night and then turn it back on in the
morning and we assume that our memories

2303
01:44:28,401 --> 01:44:30,680
when we wake up in the morning are all
accurate.

2304
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:33,990
We assume that we really did,
you know,

2305
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:38,780
wake up November 17th,
2016 in our bed,

2306
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:42,560
put our clothes on with his database of
life experiences leading up to that

2307
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:43,880
point.
But how the fuck do you know?

2308
01:44:43,881 --> 01:44:47,090
It didn't just start,
he just woke up and they might have been

2309
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:51,200
installed with this goofy life memory
that you might have started this life

2310
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:52,280
this morning.
Yeah.

2311
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:57,300
If you look into physics,
we know when I say we,

2312
01:44:57,501 --> 01:45:00,470
I mean people much smarter who are
physicists,

2313
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,350
know that things don't really exist
until you observe them.

2314
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,750
I'm going,
what the hell does that mean?

2315
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:08,630
That's a tricky thing that people say.

2316
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:12,470
That's not necessarily true.
You know what they mean by that?

2317
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,550
That when you observe something in the
act of observing it,

2318
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:17,990
you change it.
Now that's,

2319
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,870
that's a different concept,
but.

2320
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:22,460
But knowing that something's true like
the.

2321
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,440
There's the tree falls in the forest,
right?

2322
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:25,430
Is that what you're saying?
The,

2323
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:28,730
the observation changes that so that the
change thing.

2324
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:30,480
Maybe we are talking about the same.
Right,

2325
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,230
but the observation really only changes
it when you measure it.

2326
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:37,070
That's what it's the measurement.
When you know they do those particle

2327
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,600
tests,
those are off.

2328
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:40,340
Have you ever talked to a physicist
about that?

2329
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:42,200
Observing is enough.
You don't have to.

2330
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:44,750
It doesn't have to technically be made.
You have to observe it.

2331
01:45:44,751 --> 01:45:47,960
If you're not measuring well,
just looking at it like looking at what?

2332
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:50,430
Seeing it or seeing any sign of it.
Right,

2333
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:54,140
but not anything that's an indication
that it must have been enough to

2334
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:55,790
solidify the past.

2335
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:58,280
Well,
if you never observed it before and then

2336
01:45:58,281 --> 01:46:00,650
you are observing and how do you know
that there's a difference between the

2337
01:46:00,651 --> 01:46:03,800
two results?
I don't know even know what I'm talking

2338
01:46:03,801 --> 01:46:07,070
about.
I have no idea the way it's been

2339
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:10,700
explained to me by a friend of mine
who's actually a physicist,

2340
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:13,910
he said it's often,
there's a lot of woo woo that's tacked

2341
01:46:13,911 --> 01:46:16,460
onto this,
but when you're talking about these

2342
01:46:16,461 --> 01:46:20,150
measurements that people say like that
in the act of measuring something and

2343
01:46:20,151 --> 01:46:21,800
looking at something,
you change the result.

2344
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:25,040
He's lIke,
that is much better interpreted by the

2345
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:29,150
measurement itself,
the actual act of seeing something or

2346
01:46:29,151 --> 01:46:33,440
recording something or interfacing with
it in some way to get them a reading.

2347
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:35,000
As a result.
He's like,

2348
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:38,540
that's much more likely what's going on.
There's no real evidence that looking at

2349
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:41,360
something changes it because if you
weren't looking at it before,

2350
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:43,760
how do you know if it was different?
Whoa,

2351
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:46,250
well that was good.
It was crazy,

2352
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:49,260
man,
and that's not the way I understood it,

2353
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,040
but I'm

2354
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,100
also not a physicist,
nor do I have a friend who's a physicist

2355
01:46:53,101 --> 01:46:53,940
who can explain it to.

2356
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:58,070
I get confused at these things because
they're often repeated and the repeated

2357
01:46:58,071 --> 01:47:00,530
by people who haven't looked into it and
it gets me worried.

2358
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:03,650
It's one of those things like the wage
gap thing.

2359
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:06,110
Do you know The wage gap argument versus
reality?

2360
01:47:06,111 --> 01:47:07,550
I do.
I've looked into it deeply,

2361
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:10,760
so crazy one because people really smart
people will tell you,

2362
01:47:10,761 --> 01:47:14,000
women make seventy nine cents for every
dollar a man makes,

2363
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:16,970
and that gives you the impression that
they're working side by side in the same

2364
01:47:16,971 --> 01:47:19,550
factory and the woman's make it seventy
nine cents and the man's making a

2365
01:47:19,551 --> 01:47:21,200
dollar.
That's not what it means.

2366
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:26,330
What it means is overall men make a
dollar to seventy nine cents that women

2367
01:47:26,331 --> 01:47:29,180
make because of career choices,
because of jobs,

2368
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:32,180
the different jobs that they choose.
If you're going to make the argument

2369
01:47:32,181 --> 01:47:34,400
that it's more difficult for women to
get those jobs,

2370
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,440
that's a different argument and you
might be right,

2371
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:40,910
but that's not when you're saying that
the wage discrimination gap.

2372
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:44,060
Like when obama says we have to change
with wage discrimination,

2373
01:47:44,061 --> 01:47:44,441
like,
whoa,

2374
01:47:44,441 --> 01:47:47,000
what are you talking about?
Like do you think that an engineer

2375
01:47:47,001 --> 01:47:50,270
should get the same as you know,
a person who works,

2376
01:47:50,271 --> 01:47:50,691
you know,
whatever,

2377
01:47:50,691 --> 01:47:51,970
fill in the blank some,
you know,

2378
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:54,770
typical female job.
But like when it comes to science and

2379
01:47:54,771 --> 01:47:58,040
engineering and a lot of those stem sort
of subjects,

2380
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:01,880
men sort of gravitate towards them.
Men gravitate towards riskier jobs.

2381
01:48:01,881 --> 01:48:06,440
Men are more likely to die on the job.
Men choose different paths because of

2382
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,080
testosterone and their gender and to
die.

2383
01:48:09,081 --> 01:48:12,080
That seems kind of silly,
but so when they start talking about

2384
01:48:12,081 --> 01:48:15,170
this gender gap,
which everybody throws around all willy

2385
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:18,620
nilly with no research whatsoever,
they really believe that.

2386
01:48:18,621 --> 01:48:21,850
You're talking about two lawyers working
in the same firm side by side.

2387
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:24,050
The man makes a dollar.
The one who makes seventy nine cents.

2388
01:48:24,051 --> 01:48:24,820
So it's not

2389
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:27,490
how many statistics,
how many times have you been in a

2390
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:30,510
conversation with somebody who believed
in in the 79,

2391
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:34,030
seven figure and then you explained it
to them and they said,

2392
01:48:34,031 --> 01:48:35,710
oh no,
I don't think that's the case.

2393
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,300
Then you showed them a link,
you proved it beyond any doubt and it

2394
01:48:40,301 --> 01:48:41,320
still didn't change their mind.

2395
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:44,290
I won't accept the fact that could have
been wrong about something because

2396
01:48:44,291 --> 01:48:46,260
they've attached their identity to being
correct.

2397
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,610
Right.
It's a huge problem with anything gender

2398
01:48:48,611 --> 01:48:51,250
related.
The gender thing is that the idea is

2399
01:48:51,251 --> 01:48:53,410
that women have been suppressed and they
have for sure.

2400
01:48:53,411 --> 01:48:55,690
I mean women didn't get the right to
vote until the 20th century.

2401
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,220
Right.
That's kinda crazy.

2402
01:48:57,550 --> 01:48:58,340
You know,
I mean we,

2403
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:01,780
we went through a Long time in this
country where women couldn't even vote,

2404
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:04,810
so absolutely they been suppressed and
absolutely,

2405
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:06,340
there's a lot of things that brought
them out of that.

2406
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,690
First of all,
birth control,

2407
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:10,150
like the ability to choose whether or
not they're going to be pregnant.

2408
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,033
The,
the,

2409
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,520
the,
the laws,

2410
01:49:12,521 --> 01:49:15,640
changing discrimination laws,
changing people's perceptions of what

2411
01:49:15,641 --> 01:49:18,760
women are changing.
All those things are absolutely real,

2412
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:23,110
but that's.
You can't lie about numbers.

2413
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:26,800
Like as soon as you bullshit people,
then they have reason to disbelieve you,

2414
01:49:26,801 --> 01:49:27,370
but everything.

2415
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:29,320
So if you start bullshitting about the
wage gap,

2416
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:31,990
and this is not saying that it's not
More difficult to be a woman.

2417
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:34,000
I think it is.
I think it's moRe difficult because I

2418
01:49:34,001 --> 01:49:36,520
think men are pieces of shit and there's
a lot of violent,

2419
01:49:36,521 --> 01:49:38,500
dangerous,
creepy men that probably want to rape

2420
01:49:38,501 --> 01:49:41,980
you and I would hate to be a woman in
that sort of a scenario.

2421
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,070
So I'm not denying that.
It's probably more difficult in our

2422
01:49:45,071 --> 01:49:48,700
society because of a lot of shitty men.
it's more difficult to be a woman,

2423
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:52,740
but you can't lie about numbers.
As soon as you start lose students,

2424
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:57,160
you start pretending that women get paid
less for the same job across the board.

2425
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:01,030
You ruin the whole argument because now
we're not dealing in reality.

2426
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:04,810
Now we're doing the same thing where
we're not looking at caitlin jenner is a

2427
01:50:04,811 --> 01:50:05,290
human.

2428
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:08,230
We're looking at as a gender identity
hero.

2429
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:08,921
You know,
like,

2430
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:10,150
well,
what about as a human?

2431
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:15,130
Like we were supposed to celebrate
someone or or not as a human being as a

2432
01:50:15,131 --> 01:50:18,170
total package.
We're not doing that and this is where

2433
01:50:18,171 --> 01:50:23,171
we're treating the whole subject with
blinders because it pertains to gender.

2434
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:26,950
We can't look at the reality of it.
I would generalize that to say that

2435
01:50:26,951 --> 01:50:31,951
nobody's ever won an argument with data.
It almost never happens because the

2436
01:50:32,231 --> 01:50:33,850
problem is that people just say,
well,

2437
01:50:33,851 --> 01:50:36,310
your data's role,
so and that's the end of the

2438
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:37,480
conversation,
but does that.

2439
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:42,440
Isn't that less and less the case now
that ever before issue would be shed,

2440
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:45,160
but I'm,
I'm actively in conversations with

2441
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:48,010
people in which I can show them all the
data that I want.

2442
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:50,710
It makes no difference.
Humans are twitter people,

2443
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:54,370
even regular people in the world in real
life.

2444
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:55,570
yeah,
but you know,

2445
01:50:55,571 --> 01:50:57,370
there's a broad spectrum of people in
the world,

2446
01:50:57,371 --> 01:50:58,300
right?
He's.

2447
01:50:58,510 --> 01:51:00,070
When you're talking about people that
you respect,

2448
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,840
your peers,
colleagues,

2449
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:03,400
fellow cartoonIsts,
I mean,

2450
01:51:03,401 --> 01:51:08,230
you're talking about them.
are you talking about regular educated

2451
01:51:08,231 --> 01:51:10,270
people?
I've never seen anybody change their

2452
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:12,890
mind on that topic,
that specific topic.

2453
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,290
That's a weird one.
Yeah,

2454
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,310
that's a weird one.
Yeah.

2455
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,340
I've seen people have some pretty heated
discussions about it too and completely

2456
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:21,310
uninformed.
If people don't have an emotional,

2457
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:25,050
a lock on the topic,
then you can move them with data just

2458
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:26,021
because they don't care.
It's like,

2459
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:26,711
oh,
there's better data.

2460
01:51:26,711 --> 01:51:29,860
Okay,
but people are so dug in on that

2461
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:32,020
particular topic.
It's very insidious,

2462
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:36,010
very insidious because I think it like
we were talking about what the hillary

2463
01:51:36,011 --> 01:51:39,070
clinton thing about lying about Russia.
As soon as you lie about that,

2464
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:40,930
as soon as you lie about something,
well I'm going,

2465
01:51:40,931 --> 01:51:41,770
what the fuck?

2466
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:44,080
You know when when you see you,
I'm sure you've seen it,

2467
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:48,760
that director comey video where compares
what cami said versus what hillary is

2468
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:49,594
saying.
He said,

2469
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,220
and it's like,
holy shit.

2470
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:54,190
Like you're just lying.
Like you just keep lying.

2471
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:57,280
Like this is a crazy moment where you
seeing this because it didn't.

2472
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:01,480
DIdn't exist until recently.
We had This youtube phenomenon where you

2473
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:05,410
can watch and get millions of hits on
these videos where it shows the reality

2474
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:10,560
versus what you're saying and when you.
When you soon as you throw a non-reality

2475
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:13,420
into it,
I know that you're dealing with it from

2476
01:52:13,421 --> 01:52:16,330
a team perspective,
like you're just trying to manipulate

2477
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:20,260
whatever the facts are or wherever the
argument is to get your team in.

2478
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:23,290
You don't really care what's true.
You women get paid less period.

2479
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:26,260
You fucking piece of shit.
Seventy nine cents to a dollar,

2480
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:29,320
read the facts and you know,
you can't even argue with it.

2481
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,590
You can't even bring it up.
But that's everything all the time.

2482
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:35,290
If there's any emotional connection,
we just think that,

2483
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:37,780
you know,
logic and data and you know,

2484
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:39,560
arguments matter.
But yeah,

2485
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:42,310
they're just so rare.
And if you disagree also,

2486
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:43,960
you're like,
so happy to be a man.

2487
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:45,980
You must be so happy to be a man.
You think

2488
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,690
men are the only ones who could run this
world.

2489
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:51,050
You think men don't discriminate against
women every step of the way.

2490
01:52:51,051 --> 01:52:53,150
It must be really nice to have that
white male privileged.

2491
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:58,151
Scott adams.
The sarcasm as a replacement for reason

2492
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:01,490
is probably the most annoying thing in
the world.

2493
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:02,440
And I've been,
you know,

2494
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:06,800
the sarcasm has been raining on me for a
year for writing about trump,

2495
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:09,260
but yeah,
it's exactly what you said is like,

2496
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:13,670
so then trump would get elected and then
he'll just make everything good and then

2497
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:15,470
there will be just unicorns,
right?

2498
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:19,430
Yeah.
That's a weird argument that people love

2499
01:53:19,431 --> 01:53:22,070
to put words in your mouth and then
force you to defend them.

2500
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:27,590
I talk about the word,
so as a tell for that,

2501
01:53:27,591 --> 01:53:29,840
whatever's going to come next as a
hallucination.

2502
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:32,430
So,
so if you say to say to me,

2503
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:33,330
you know,
it doesn't matter who said,

2504
01:53:33,331 --> 01:53:34,490
uh,
you know,

2505
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,530
uh,
I went to the store yesterday,

2506
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,083
I would say.

2507
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:42,320
So you abandoned your children,
have,

2508
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:44,440
you know,
whatever comes,

2509
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:46,880
we'll just won't make any sense.
Oh my god,

2510
01:53:46,881 --> 01:53:48,950
that's hilarious.
That's really funny.

2511
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:50,990
Yeah,
you can definitely do that.

2512
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,580
I mean,
that's the art of persuasion,

2513
01:53:52,581 --> 01:53:53,540
right?
That's hypnosis.

2514
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:55,190
That's what you're into.
Do you have a pocket watch?

2515
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,660
You have one of those?
No,

2516
01:53:56,661 --> 01:53:58,490
that's not part of the process.
Weirdly enough.

2517
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,430
But it isn't cartoons and movies.
Yes.

2518
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,760
I think there was it ever.
I think there was one movie,

2519
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:07,940
so that's well known in the history that
this one movie,

2520
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:12,170
I don't know what it was a showed
somebody doing using a watch to

2521
01:54:12,171 --> 01:54:13,820
hypnotize and then it just became a
thing,

2522
01:54:13,821 --> 01:54:16,490
but it was never a thing within the
hypnotist world.

2523
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:21,500
Was theRe ever a moment during this
whole campaign where it was getting

2524
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:25,280
really crazy and people were angry about
so many different things?

2525
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,220
Like how about when all those women came
out in mass?

2526
01:54:28,221 --> 01:54:30,470
Right.
There was this and moss and moss.

2527
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:34,040
There was at one time were all these
women were coming out saYing Donald

2528
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,740
Trump tried to grab my tits and Donald
Trump and some of them were pretty

2529
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:39,860
innocuous,
but it was all together like a

2530
01:54:39,861 --> 01:54:42,680
coordinated effort.
Was there ever a moment wHere you're

2531
01:54:42,681 --> 01:54:44,300
like,
what the fuck that I do?

2532
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:46,550
Like why did I come out and supported
this guy?

2533
01:54:46,551 --> 01:54:49,600
Like what Did I.
The hate that I'm getting right now that

2534
01:54:49,601 --> 01:54:53,340
that was the moment that I switched my
endorsement that Gary Johnson.

2535
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:57,260
I remember that and my reasoning was
because Gary Johnson only touches

2536
01:54:57,261 --> 01:55:00,560
himself and that's something that I can
respect in a leader.

2537
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:03,830
No trouble there,
but that was tongue in cheek.

2538
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:06,710
It was tongue and cheek,
but I was also getting out of the blast

2539
01:55:06,711 --> 01:55:09,320
zone.
I remember I was never as supporting him

2540
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:12,560
based on policies or I was just talking
about is persuasion,

2541
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:15,080
but was there ever a time where you
thought,

2542
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:18,110
I should probably make a moral
distinction because I'm getting caught

2543
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:23,830
up in this wave of angry white people
and their massage and racism and all the

2544
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:26,190
credit.

2545
01:55:26,190 --> 01:55:27,500
I mean that was the worst aspects,
right?

2546
01:55:27,501 --> 01:55:30,680
That the two percent that we already
discussed it and you get caught up in

2547
01:55:30,681 --> 01:55:35,270
this association game that people are
doing when they have this us versus them

2548
01:55:35,310 --> 01:55:37,340
little battle going on.
Did you ever think like,

2549
01:55:37,341 --> 01:55:38,960
what the fuck man,
what did I do?

2550
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:42,540
Not in those words,
but I'm.

2551
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,460
I'm fortunately

2552
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,590
in,
in a situation where I have what I call

2553
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:50,340
fuck you money and I can.
I can kind of take some risks that you

2554
01:55:50,341 --> 01:55:55,341
wouldn't take earlier in your career and
one of them is the risk to say what ever

2555
01:55:55,421 --> 01:55:58,800
I think is useful and necessary and I
want to say,

2556
01:55:58,950 --> 01:56:03,950
and so that is a huge risk to be
associated with anybody unpleasant.

2557
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:07,650
But uh,
at the same time I self identify with

2558
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:10,920
being ultra liberal,
like liberal people seem a little too

2559
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:13,050
conservative for me.
I'm left to them.

2560
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:17,410
That is interesting about you and I,
I definitely wanted to get to that

2561
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:20,800
because you're not a right wing guy.
You know,

2562
01:56:20,801 --> 01:56:22,930
you,
you're very reasonable.

2563
01:56:22,990 --> 01:56:25,450
And that's what I,
what I thought was so fascinating about

2564
01:56:25,451 --> 01:56:26,110
this.
I'm like,

2565
01:56:26,110 --> 01:56:27,670
and it actually makes sense now.
You say it,

2566
01:56:27,671 --> 01:56:30,100
you have fuck you money,
so why shouldn't you just speak about

2567
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:32,890
whatever attributes,
positive or negative you might see and

2568
01:56:32,891 --> 01:56:35,470
when look at it,
almost like you're looking at a puzzle,

2569
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:36,261
you know,
all low.

2570
01:56:36,261 --> 01:56:38,560
We'll look at this piece here.
This piece is going to go right there

2571
01:56:38,561 --> 01:56:39,790
and see there's an opening here.

2572
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,730
It's weird.
There was a space for this of somebody

2573
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:46,650
who didn't have a team.
Yes.

2574
01:56:46,850 --> 01:56:49,500
As part of the reason I don't vote,
I don't join a party.

2575
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,030
You didn't vote at all?
No,

2576
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:54,180
it
isn't that ironic.

2577
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,460
It would bias me.
Oh,

2578
01:56:56,461 --> 01:56:58,560
I see.
As soon as you vote,

2579
01:56:58,561 --> 01:57:02,500
you joined the team but you like a
klingon in this world.

2580
01:57:02,501 --> 01:57:06,870
He just wrote roman through the streets
and then people make those rules and use

2581
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,520
to bide by them.
How does that work?

2582
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:11,340
Ah,
non participant in our democracy.

2583
01:57:11,341 --> 01:57:12,750
Scott adams.
Well,

2584
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:16,650
secretly canadian by California.
And so I didn't think it mattered that

2585
01:57:16,651 --> 01:57:18,830
much who I voted for.
Um,

2586
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:21,780
but I also think that staying unbiased
is important.

2587
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,090
So I'm just not a joiner.
But wHat about others?

2588
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:26,870
Things like you could always write in a
presidential candidate if you want to do

2589
01:57:26,871 --> 01:57:28,340
that,
but like voting on things like

2590
01:57:28,341 --> 01:57:30,770
legalizing marijuana,
things that are really important.

2591
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:31,723
I mean that's.

2592
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:34,990
You don't notice I go right to that.
Forget fuck the death penalty.

2593
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,080
There's a lot of important issues you
could vote on,

2594
01:57:38,081 --> 01:57:38,890
right?
Yeah.

2595
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:42,730
But my take on that is that the people
who think they understand those issues

2596
01:57:42,731 --> 01:57:46,480
almost never do.
And the few that I could understand well

2597
01:57:46,481 --> 01:57:48,100
enough,
like legalizing weed,

2598
01:57:48,610 --> 01:57:51,340
um,
it was going the way I wanted it anyway.

2599
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:55,570
so according to the polls that thought
that hillary clinton was gonna win,

2600
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,460
see all these polls,
the problem,

2601
01:57:57,610 --> 01:58:01,250
the weed pulls where we're much more
accurate and it

2602
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:06,120
or a gap there,
the weed pulls are more accurate.

2603
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:08,360
Well,
they are for sure it won.

2604
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:10,410
It won by a landslide.
But I thought it was important.

2605
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:14,010
I felt like if I was going to vote,
I mean the voting for freedom,

2606
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,630
wherever it is,
wherever it's possible,

2607
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:18,780
especially freedom is not,
you're not hurting anybody and you're

2608
01:58:18,781 --> 01:58:21,660
removing the possibility of being locked
up for something.

2609
01:58:21,661 --> 01:58:25,080
IT's not hurting anybody across the
board whether it's pot or whether it's

2610
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:26,330
wearing dresses.
Um,

2611
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:30,360
for that I would be just as enthusiastic
about a transgender law if someone made

2612
01:58:30,361 --> 01:58:33,030
it a law where a man couldn't become a
woman,

2613
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:34,770
you know?
And then we were fighting against that.

2614
01:58:34,771 --> 01:58:39,771
I would be as enthusiastic as I am about
almost almost enthusiasts to pot thing

2615
01:58:40,801 --> 01:58:43,600
to is a,
represents a freedom issue as much as it

2616
01:58:43,601 --> 01:58:44,434
is anything else.

2617
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:47,190
I put those in a different frame.
So,

2618
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,480
um,
you know,

2619
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:51,570
the birth of the nation,
there was this debate about states'

2620
01:58:51,571 --> 01:58:53,850
rights and you know,
what's the federal government do and the

2621
01:58:53,851 --> 01:58:56,310
idea was that the more local the
government,

2622
01:58:56,311 --> 01:58:58,860
the better they understood the people
and stuff like that.

2623
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:01,830
But fast forward today with the internet
and,

2624
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:06,480
and more and the states are like little
laboratories so we can watch,

2625
01:59:06,481 --> 01:59:07,830
hey,
how'd it go in Colorado?

2626
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:11,370
So we're,
we don't Have to argue on principle or

2627
01:59:11,371 --> 01:59:14,640
morality anymore.
we're actually beyond that because we

2628
01:59:14,641 --> 01:59:16,920
can measure,
we can ab test with the,

2629
01:59:16,921 --> 01:59:18,120
uh,
with the states.

2630
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:22,740
So with everything from abortion law to
a weed,

2631
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:24,090
um,
you can say,

2632
01:59:24,091 --> 01:59:26,010
hey,
let the states Do it and let's just make

2633
01:59:26,011 --> 01:59:29,550
sure we measure it,
make sure we have a real,

2634
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,090
a thing that matters,
that,

2635
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:33,340
that we can say if it reaches this
level,

2636
01:59:33,341 --> 01:59:35,220
they work.
If there's crime it didn't.

2637
01:59:36,030 --> 01:59:38,220
Um,
and I think that's the direction we're

2638
01:59:38,221 --> 01:59:42,480
going,
which is insanely useful because it

2639
01:59:42,481 --> 01:59:45,900
takes all the emotion out of it because
like we don't have to wonder if it's our

2640
01:59:45,901 --> 01:59:48,690
right to smoke weed or anything,
just see how it worked out.

2641
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:49,750
I,
uh,

2642
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:51,610
I don't disagree With what you're
saying,

2643
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:55,600
but I also think that it's that too.
I think the morality and ethics play a

2644
01:59:55,601 --> 01:59:58,990
part of it as well.
I think reading for the first state.

2645
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:01,570
Okay.
But after that you can just see what

2646
02:00:01,571 --> 02:00:03,280
happened,
man,

2647
02:00:03,281 --> 02:00:06,670
I don't know because that means in the
49 other states you leave open the

2648
02:00:06,671 --> 02:00:10,930
possibility that people are going to be
locked up in jail for nonviolent crimes

2649
02:00:10,931 --> 02:00:13,870
that don't hurt anyone.
And that seems to be a giant ethic

2650
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:16,640
temporarily.
Even if it's temporarily,

2651
02:00:16,641 --> 02:00:19,900
it could ruin their life knowing that
the law,

2652
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,310
the law,
is this temporary,

2653
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:24,260
it was temporarily still,
they're still there.

2654
02:00:24,261 --> 02:00:27,610
That's not optimal.
It's not optimal and the consequences

2655
02:00:27,611 --> 02:00:29,770
are too grave.
You're taking away people's freedom.

2656
02:00:29,771 --> 02:00:32,800
So to me it becomes primarily a freedom
issue.

2657
02:00:32,801 --> 02:00:36,160
The same way it'd be if men wanted to
wear dresses or if women wanted to wear

2658
02:00:36,161 --> 02:00:38,230
combat boots and all of sudden we said,
we can't have that anymore.

2659
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:39,880
Well,
you're giving two examples that I

2660
02:00:39,881 --> 02:00:41,360
consider easy.
You know,

2661
02:00:41,361 --> 02:00:42,960
the weed and the,
you know,

2662
02:00:42,970 --> 02:00:44,080
the,
the gender thing.

2663
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:46,300
Those are easy.
Those should be available to everybody.

2664
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:46,780
I go,
okay,

2665
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:50,950
so let's go with one that's hard.
Which would be automated cars.

2666
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:52,060
Oh,
that's.

2667
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:53,200
I love that one.
Yeah.

2668
02:00:53,410 --> 02:00:54,640
How about this one?
Good example,

2669
02:00:54,641 --> 02:00:56,230
like when we get to a certain point in
time,

2670
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:59,020
will we lose our freedom to be
autonomous?

2671
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:02,770
Will we lose our freedom to be able to
drive a car and be able to steer and

2672
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,600
trust you to hit the brakes when you're
supposed to?

2673
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:06,740
Oh,
all of your autonomy is going away.

2674
02:01:06,741 --> 02:01:07,960
It's going aWay.
So.

2675
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:09,860
So think about this.
I blogged about this today.

2676
02:01:09,950 --> 02:01:13,030
Suppose you had a fitness band and it
was like the future.

2677
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:15,750
I'm not,
not long time of five or 10 years and

2678
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,590
they can do everything from tell you
when you should take a sip of water

2679
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:20,960
because you're dehydrated.
It knows what kind of food you should

2680
02:01:20,961 --> 02:01:23,780
eat and when it was,
when you should sleep and it tells you

2681
02:01:23,781 --> 02:01:27,170
how the,
in the beginning you're going to say,

2682
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:28,400
oh,
good suggestion.

2683
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:31,520
I'll either do that or not,
but eventually you're going to see that

2684
02:01:31,521 --> 02:01:34,850
their suggestion is better than whatever
the hell you would have done on your own

2685
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:38,710
and you're just going to start following
the app and eventually that app is going

2686
02:01:38,711 --> 02:01:40,070
to be controlling your

2687
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,070
life while you have the sensation that
you're deciding.

2688
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:48,200
maybe you dude nomy rebel out there.
I to make my own choices.

2689
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:50,210
I'm going to rip off that fitbit.
Yeah man.

2690
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:51,770
Fuck that.
Fitbit were free.

2691
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:56,570
I'm going to run and when I feel tired
I'll stop or keep pushing because that's

2692
02:01:56,571 --> 02:01:58,340
what I do.
Push harder.

2693
02:01:58,341 --> 02:02:00,440
Hashtag push harder.
Um,

2694
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:02,300
I know what you're saying.
I agree.

2695
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:07,580
I think also people like when things
become,

2696
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:10,280
when you have less stuff to talk about
or think about,

2697
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,750
you know,
and as soon as you get in your car and

2698
02:02:11,751 --> 02:02:13,670
the car drives itself,
well now I don't have to think about

2699
02:02:13,671 --> 02:02:15,020
that anymore.
You know,

2700
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:19,040
I was going to invest in alcohol
companies,

2701
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:21,170
you know,
companies that produced and manufactured

2702
02:02:21,171 --> 02:02:24,620
alcohol because it could be drunk in
your car now because self driving cars

2703
02:02:24,621 --> 02:02:25,550
are coming.
Right,

2704
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:27,380
right.
And the day they do,

2705
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,670
80 percent of the reasons not to drink
just goes away,

2706
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:33,320
which is how do you get home?

2707
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:35,990
That's a good point.
Yeah.

2708
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:38,810
Do you think they'll have no steering
wheel at all?

2709
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,250
Like what?
If everything goes wrong?

2710
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:43,460
I think it will have his steering wheel
because you know,

2711
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:45,530
you have to get off the road and
present.

2712
02:02:45,531 --> 02:02:47,360
If you get drunk you're like fuck it.
I could drive.

2713
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,640
You want to drive.
Even though it's autonomous,

2714
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:52,520
right?
You'll be too drunk to program the

2715
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:55,070
address and you're like,
what kind of drive?

2716
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:57,890
And it started driving.
Good point.

2717
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:01,400
We don't have that problem with uber,
you know,

2718
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:04,010
no matter how drunk I am,
I never tried to come out from the back

2719
02:03:04,011 --> 02:03:06,200
and yeah,
but it's not right in front of you.

2720
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:09,620
And also with uber you're too busy
trying to figure out whether the guy

2721
02:03:09,621 --> 02:03:13,730
driving needs a serial killer.
You need a breathalyzer on there to get

2722
02:03:13,731 --> 02:03:17,540
control of the steering wheel.
You need to be able to take a swab and

2723
02:03:17,541 --> 02:03:18,950
run it through machines from them.

2724
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:23,300
What kind of dna that's fucking creep.
Has you ever gone through security

2725
02:03:23,301 --> 02:03:27,800
lately and they do the little swab.
They put it in the machine and I'm

2726
02:03:27,801 --> 02:03:30,170
thinking,
what does it know about me?

2727
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:35,380
How much can it figure it out for me?
Because from your odor and your dna or

2728
02:03:36,291 --> 02:03:39,500
whatever the hell they're looking at,
they could probably know a lot about me.

2729
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,050
Yeah,
they definitely could if they.

2730
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:46,020
Well tHat's the big argument about those
fingerprint scanners on cell phones that

2731
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:49,970
they're slowly but surely accumulating a
database of fingerprints of all the

2732
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:52,250
people in this country.
Yeah.

2733
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:57,730
That's scary to
slowly but surely the boundaries between

2734
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:02,240
people and data are eroding.
So let me ask you this.

2735
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:04,060
So in the news today,
um,

2736
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:06,500
I don't know who said it,
it wasn't trump himself.

2737
02:04:06,501 --> 02:04:10,250
I think that the discussion of a muslim
database,

2738
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:13,850
did you hear them?
The idea of collecting names.

2739
02:04:13,851 --> 02:04:17,870
I think only the people who are
noncitizens coming into the country

2740
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:19,340
which raises,
you know,

2741
02:04:19,341 --> 02:04:24,070
every kind of nazi concentration camp
alarm and should um,

2742
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,440
but do you think we don't already have
that list?

2743
02:04:27,990 --> 02:04:30,680
Don't question,
don't you think that somewhere in our

2744
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:34,190
big data,
which they can't tell the citizens and

2745
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:36,740
in fact they can even tell the
politicians because they're probably

2746
02:04:36,741 --> 02:04:38,100
only a few people who

2747
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,260
know,
probably a few people in the government

2748
02:04:40,261 --> 02:04:44,700
who know what we know about citizens.
But the idea that there's anybody coming

2749
02:04:44,701 --> 02:04:48,240
into the country and we don't have a
really good idea of where they are at

2750
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:50,370
any time.
I mean if they have back doors into

2751
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:53,340
everything from the credit card
processing companies to,

2752
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:56,340
you know,
all the other big cell phone companies,

2753
02:04:56,850 --> 02:04:59,910
they have a working profile on
everybody.

2754
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:02,540
If they want it done.
In other words,

2755
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:04,290
I have to push the button to run the
program.

2756
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:07,560
But if they wanted to know,
if they wanted to know your religion,

2757
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:11,550
they wouldn't need to have you fill it
out in a form becauSe they could check

2758
02:05:11,551 --> 02:05:12,640
your credIt card and say,
hey,

2759
02:05:12,641 --> 02:05:14,670
you buys gas next to the,
you know,

2760
02:05:14,671 --> 02:05:17,400
the synagogue or the mosque or whatever.
And his friends are.

2761
02:05:17,401 --> 02:05:19,650
They use because they do the same things
at the same time.

2762
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:22,020
Big data already knows your religion.

2763
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:25,290
If someone wants to track down all that
stuff,

2764
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:27,690
it's the thing is who is the someone?
How many?

2765
02:05:27,691 --> 02:05:29,640
Like I have a friend.
It's always worried.

2766
02:05:29,641 --> 02:05:32,790
The government's like looking into his
email and following them.

2767
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:34,620
And I.
This is what I always say,

2768
02:05:34,621 --> 02:05:37,710
like who's,
how many people are they doing this to?

2769
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:40,500
There's hundreds of millions of people.
How many people work in the government?

2770
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:41,880
How are they doing that?
Like,

2771
02:05:41,881 --> 02:05:43,020
here's a,
here's a good story.

2772
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:45,050
This is how people will think,
oh,

2773
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:45,990
the following me,
man,

2774
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:48,780
listen to this story.
The guy who broke into the white house,

2775
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:51,780
do you know about that story?
The guy who ran through the white.

2776
02:05:51,781 --> 02:05:55,620
I add a bit about it in my last netflix
special because this is where

2777
02:05:55,621 --> 02:05:58,980
progressiveness goddess is ridiculous
idea that everybody's equal.

2778
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:03,390
They left a woman guarding the door of
the white house by herself.

2779
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:04,860
This is a true story.

2780
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:08,220
The guy hopped the fence.
He was crazy.

2781
02:06:08,221 --> 02:06:12,150
Ptsd down out of his fucking mind
veteran ran across the lawn.

2782
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:15,900
The guy who was in charge of monitoring
the,

2783
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:16,620
the,
the,

2784
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:19,080
the grassy area where this guy ran
across,

2785
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:22,800
took his earpiece out and was on the
phone with his girlfriend.

2786
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:26,280
So this guy was like having a
conversation with a girlfriend while

2787
02:06:26,281 --> 02:06:29,370
this guy's running across the lawn.
The guy gets to the front door,

2788
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:33,270
the alarm system is down because he kept
fucking up,

2789
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:36,900
so they just shut it off.
So they left a girl by herself at the

2790
02:06:36,901 --> 02:06:39,660
door with no alarm or a guy just ran
across the lawn.

2791
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:41,940
Then you find out about the guy.
Well,

2792
02:06:41,941 --> 02:06:46,941
the guy turns out was arrested just a
couple of months before this with 800

2793
02:06:48,421 --> 02:06:52,260
fucking rounds of ammunition for like
four rifles,

2794
02:06:52,261 --> 02:06:57,261
two handguns and machete and acts the
arm to the tits with a fucking map of

2795
02:06:58,891 --> 02:07:02,490
Washington dc with an x where the white
house is.

2796
02:07:03,090 --> 02:07:07,170
They weren't watching that guy like they
weren't even watching him.

2797
02:07:07,910 --> 02:07:12,910
Like we are dealing with way more in
competence than we would like to believe

2798
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:14,970
or that we would care to admit.

2799
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:19,980
So that was the case of a criminal
investigation that the law enforcement

2800
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:21,300
people didn't coordinate.
Right?

2801
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:24,850
Well,
it was both that and complete arrogance

2802
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:28,990
and not having an alarm system on not
having more than one person guarding the

2803
02:07:28,991 --> 02:07:31,510
lawn,
not having more than one person at the

2804
02:07:31,511 --> 02:07:33,010
door,
having a woman at the door,

2805
02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:36,490
like by herself with his fucking giant

2806
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:39,250
soldier comes running through and
knocked her to the ground and runs

2807
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:41,470
around the white house.
Say thIs is a perfect example.

2808
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:44,320
So since that never had happened before,
like,

2809
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:45,370
you know,
probably.

2810
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:48,460
Well maybe not 100 years of 18.
12 was the last time it happened before

2811
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:49,060
that.
Oh,

2812
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:50,850
well,
1912 excuse,

2813
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:52,990
so you're never really ready for the
thing that hasn't happened.

2814
02:07:52,991 --> 02:07:55,660
I always think about if if nuclear war
broke out,

2815
02:07:56,090 --> 02:07:58,240
like let's say Russia and the United
States decided,

2816
02:07:58,241 --> 02:08:00,580
all right,
it's on and we're gonna launch.

2817
02:08:01,150 --> 02:08:04,780
I don't think they'd work the two bombs,
the bombs,

2818
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:07,450
because we'd never done it before.
like we've only tested.

2819
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:10,720
We've tested the bomb and we've tested
the missile,

2820
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:14,410
but we haven't tested the missile on the
bomb and the chain of command and who

2821
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:17,260
puts the codes and sure we've tested all
the parts.

2822
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:21,640
imagine it was all fucking for gazy
scheme and like there's nothing even in

2823
02:08:21,641 --> 02:08:22,470
those things.

2824
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:27,040
I just taken that tax dollars and using
it for satanic rituals and flying on

2825
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:30,580
private jets everywhere.
did you read all that stuff?

2826
02:08:30,581 --> 02:08:35,581
That podesta stuff that came out in the
wiki leaks emails about all the weird

2827
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:40,801
rituals they were going to the spirit
cooking involved sperm and blood and why

2828
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:47,520
in the fuck are they doing like,
I don't like to believe when Alex Jones

2829
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:50,410
goes onto his fucking crazy.
TheY're all satanists.

2830
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,330
EverY one of them.
They're all worshiping satan.

2831
02:08:52,530 --> 02:08:54,280
You know,
you'd go wIth Alex Jones is crazy,

2832
02:08:54,281 --> 02:08:56,080
he's going crazy.
Obama is a devil,

2833
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:58,300
literally a devil in hell.
and you go,

2834
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:01,900
Alex Jones out of his fucking mind.
and then you see this pedesta thing

2835
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:05,480
where you know some,
they're doing satan rituals like this

2836
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:10,690
went to it went to watch something
called spirit cooking.

2837
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:13,360
Well,
but you heard the explanation.

2838
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:17,200
I did not.
So the explanation was the woman who I

2839
02:09:17,201 --> 02:09:19,570
guess was the hostess says,
oh yeah,

2840
02:09:19,571 --> 02:09:22,030
it does mean those other things,
but we've sort of,

2841
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:25,000
you know,
cutely just generalized it to whatever

2842
02:09:25,001 --> 02:09:25,640
we're doing.

2843
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:26,680
So,
so the spirit,

2844
02:09:26,681 --> 02:09:28,070
carole king,
but didn't meet any of that.

2845
02:09:28,150 --> 02:09:30,400
I don't buy that.
I don't buy that for a second.

2846
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:34,750
I'm not sure I buy that they were all
getting together to eat blood and sperm.

2847
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,400
well,
why are they even talking about it?

2848
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:38,710
My friends and I,
we never get together and talk about

2849
02:09:38,850 --> 02:09:39,880
blood and sperm.
No,

2850
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:41,380
never comes out.
They didn't talk about it,

2851
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:42,191
but somebody did.
well,

2852
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:44,440
the email just said,
do you want to go to the spirit cooking

2853
02:09:44,441 --> 02:09:44,891
thing?
right?

2854
02:09:44,891 --> 02:09:47,680
But then when you find out what the
spirit cooking is and involves blood and

2855
02:09:47,681 --> 02:09:48,340
sperm,
right,

2856
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:51,850
was one of the things that means.
So is there a good party by the way?

2857
02:09:53,250 --> 02:09:57,730
It's not a party until somebody believes
so many bleeds and somebody comes.

2858
02:09:57,910 --> 02:10:00,550
I didn't look into the explanation
because to me it's one of those things

2859
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:05,290
that I don't want to know any further
pat because it's too fun to think these

2860
02:10:05,291 --> 02:10:09,400
wacky fucks are out there.
Just a puck bucket of blood and drinking

2861
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:13,930
it and throwing it on themselves.
That's more fun to me than rational

2862
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:15,820
explanation.
I think the best moment of the whole

2863
02:10:15,821 --> 02:10:20,821
year was related to that.
It was a mike cernovich was tweeting

2864
02:10:20,981 --> 02:10:23,050
about it the most.
And I realized that,

2865
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:28,270
I think it was the Washington post ran a
piece by piece sort of explaining why it

2866
02:10:28,271 --> 02:10:30,220
wasn't what it was.
And I thought,

2867
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:33,470
where have we come to the point where
mike cernovich makes,

2868
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:34,130
uh,

2869
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,910
the Washington post,
uh,

2870
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:40,540
defend how much sperm pedesta it's like,
no,

2871
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:42,980
no.
It was way less burden than you think.

2872
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:47,090
It was a couple of drops.
That's all you need.

2873
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:49,010
That's all you need.
A couple of drops.

2874
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:50,870
It's,
it's a symbolic thing.

2875
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:55,220
this is totally unrelated,
but did you see the real sports from

2876
02:10:55,221 --> 02:10:59,290
this week with a beak from yoga guy?
You see brian?

2877
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:00,920
Uh,
what's his name?

2878
02:11:00,921 --> 02:11:02,420
Brian gumbel.
Thank you.

2879
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:04,690
Uh,
he uh,

2880
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:07,700
did this real sports,
one of his episodes,

2881
02:11:07,701 --> 02:11:12,230
he had this woman go away and
investigate a beaker from knowing,

2882
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:15,440
I think his name is.
He's the guy that's the lead of bikram

2883
02:11:15,441 --> 02:11:20,441
yoga and uh,
apparently he's allegedly banged a bunch

2884
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:23,570
of chicks that work there and you know,
sexually harassed him,

2885
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:25,160
allegedly,
allegedly,

2886
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:28,250
allegedly keep saying that.
But he was,

2887
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:29,660
they were saying.
And he was like,

2888
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:34,661
why would I do that when women will pay
$1 for one drop of my sperm saying he

2889
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:37,183
was saying,
yeah,

2890
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:41,510
he was saying there's thousands of women
signing up to fuck him and that four of

2891
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:44,660
them committed suicide because he
wouldn't fuck them and that people are

2892
02:11:44,661 --> 02:11:47,720
willing to pay a million dollars for a
drop of his sperm.

2893
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:52,820
Well,
they're out there folks.

2894
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:55,460
That's a good argument.
There's some crazy fucking people out

2895
02:11:55,461 --> 02:11:56,960
there.
I would have defended myself

2896
02:11:56,961 --> 02:11:57,920
differently.
I would say,

2897
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,230
well,
the women who come here for yoga,

2898
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:03,080
they were very flexible.
That's money laundering right there.

2899
02:12:03,230 --> 02:12:06,350
Someone's paying a million dollars for
his sperm for one drop of sperm.

2900
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:08,810
That's a guy who's selling drugs,
trying to get rid of cash,

2901
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:11,450
is trying to move some money around.
That's what he's doing.

2902
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:14,240
Well,
I mean it's the ultimate telecommuting

2903
02:12:14,241 --> 02:12:15,020
job.
It's like,

2904
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:17,600
I can't come to the office.
I'll be home today.

2905
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:19,670
I'm like,
what is a gallon today?

2906
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:21,050
Well,
one drop.

2907
02:12:21,051 --> 02:12:23,390
I mean,
you got a lot of drops if you're.

2908
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:26,240
If you're healthy,
if you eat eggs and drink milk.

2909
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:30,290
Do you?
My point being that there's a lot of

2910
02:12:30,291 --> 02:12:33,020
fucking crazy people in this world and
this guy,

2911
02:12:33,021 --> 02:12:36,830
podesta guy being involved in this wacky
spirit cooking thing.

2912
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:39,500
I'm not shocked.
I'm not shocked.

2913
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:42,380
This yoga guy,
this guy that you think of as being like

2914
02:12:42,381 --> 02:12:47,381
peace and sot nom and not my stay and
we're all going to flow together and

2915
02:12:47,541 --> 02:12:48,770
realize we're all want.
He's like,

2916
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:53,450
I did pay $1,000,000 for one drop of my
spam.

2917
02:12:53,690 --> 02:12:56,390
He suck.
He's crazy and he's the head of this

2918
02:12:56,391 --> 02:12:59,540
yoga organization,
which we all think we immediately

2919
02:12:59,541 --> 02:13:04,541
associate yoga with peace and love and
happiness and he's talking about all

2920
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:09,950
these women that accused them of being
human trash and pieces of shit and it's

2921
02:13:09,951 --> 02:13:11,240
like,
whoa.

2922
02:13:11,241 --> 02:13:16,241
Like think about how trump responded to
the allegations against him versus how

2923
02:13:17,331 --> 02:13:22,331
this yoga guy responded way worse.
He should have gone with a nickname

2924
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:28,160
lying yoga hose,
what we call them,

2925
02:13:28,850 --> 02:13:33,850
but my point is that there's some crazy
people out there involved in all sorts

2926
02:13:34,111 --> 02:13:35,880
of weird stuff where you would never
imagine.

2927
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:39,220
Well,
it also gets to the fact that I just tie

2928
02:13:39,221 --> 02:13:44,040
that together pretending I had a point,
but it kind of goes to the point where

2929
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:47,610
we'll never have a nice person who is
president again.

2930
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:48,930
Oh,
because it's true.

2931
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,610
No,
it's because the only reason you thought

2932
02:13:50,611 --> 02:13:52,800
anybody was nice and he didn't know
enough about them,

2933
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:54,810
but that's not true.
This is nice people,

2934
02:13:54,811 --> 02:13:55,644
right?
You're a nice guy.

2935
02:13:55,670 --> 02:13:57,630
Don't you run for president?
I'm a nice guy.

2936
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:00,900
But if you were to dissect my entire
paSt,

2937
02:14:01,170 --> 02:14:02,280
I would look like,
you know,

2938
02:14:02,281 --> 02:14:04,800
satan incarnate by the time they got
done with me,

2939
02:14:04,890 --> 02:14:08,520
maybe now,
but I think within the next four years,

2940
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:12,660
by the time trump is a on a second term,
if he decides to run again,

2941
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:13,890
and if he wins,
right?

2942
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,880
Which would be crazy.
Right?

2943
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:17,340
To term trump who,
that's a shirt.

2944
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:18,270
I see it.

2945
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:20,280
I see a bumper sticker now to term
trump.

2946
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:21,740
Trump,
trump,

2947
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:22,321
trump,
trump,

2948
02:14:22,321 --> 02:14:23,910
trump.
Like if you guys start chanting that

2949
02:14:23,911 --> 02:14:24,744
shit,
I want credit.

2950
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:25,920
Okay.
I came up with it,

2951
02:14:26,430 --> 02:14:30,000
but I,
I really could see that by that time it

2952
02:14:30,001 --> 02:14:32,310
will be way more difficult to just.
First of all,

2953
02:14:32,311 --> 02:14:35,850
we were going to have to acknowledge
that you can't just edit little pieces

2954
02:14:35,851 --> 02:14:38,670
of someone's life and make some sort of
a,

2955
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:43,080
an absolute definitive statement on who
they are based on out of context

2956
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:46,530
statements and things.
And also this idea that like something

2957
02:14:46,531 --> 02:14:51,531
you did in 2001 somehow defines you in
2016 and you're the same person,

2958
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:55,800
right?
Isn't the point of life to improve 100

2959
02:14:55,801 --> 02:15:00,801
percent to say trump did terrible things
30 years ago and I think that what's he

2960
02:15:01,501 --> 02:15:04,050
doing,
he's trying to do things good for the

2961
02:15:04,051 --> 02:15:05,580
country.
Isn't that like the arc?

2962
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:08,370
We're all supposed to be on where you
used to be kind of a,

2963
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:09,630
you know,
not a good person,

2964
02:15:09,631 --> 02:15:10,560
but you're getting better.
Well,

2965
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:13,500
we would hope they used to be a really
good person and now you're a god.

2966
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,360
That's what I'm looking for.
No,

2967
02:15:15,361 --> 02:15:17,550
anybody like tHat.
I would.

2968
02:15:17,970 --> 02:15:22,680
I want someone who is perfect in the
nineties and is now transcended humanity

2969
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:25,020
and is ready to lead because that's what
we need.

2970
02:15:25,021 --> 02:15:27,220
We can't have people leading anymore.
We need some,

2971
02:15:27,350 --> 02:15:30,630
a real guru.
You want to go the full cult?

2972
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:34,080
Turn this nation into a cult?
Well,

2973
02:15:34,081 --> 02:15:35,730
we'll see.
We'll see what donald wanted.

2974
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:36,660
The full.
I just.

2975
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:40,650
I think we Haven't completely
unrealistic expectation as far as

2976
02:15:40,651 --> 02:15:43,080
someone who would put it like jfk,
right?

2977
02:15:43,110 --> 02:15:44,670
Perfect example that everyone always
uses.

2978
02:15:44,671 --> 02:15:47,310
If he was running today,
he'd be picked apart.

2979
02:15:47,311 --> 02:15:48,810
Clinton,
another perfect example.

2980
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,320
If you look at him on paper as far as
policy,

2981
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:54,900
take out the monica lewinsky scandal and
just look at what he's done with the

2982
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:58,110
economy was like during this time and
make your arguments plus or minus that

2983
02:15:58,111 --> 02:16:00,330
he,
you know how much of it was because of

2984
02:16:00,331 --> 02:16:02,250
him,
how much of it was he was in a lucky

2985
02:16:02,251 --> 02:16:04,080
spot as far as being a president.
Right.

2986
02:16:04,081 --> 02:16:07,830
There's those Arguments,
but you look at him like that and you

2987
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:08,330
go,
wow,

2988
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:12,330
there's thIs guy who was a great guy,
but then either Jennifer Flowers in

2989
02:16:12,331 --> 02:16:15,090
Nepal on jones and the this and that and
all these different.

2990
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,610
Then you have a totally different idea
of who this guy really is.

2991
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:20,730
The truth is probably somewhere in the
middle,

2992
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:22,290
right?
Yeah.

2993
02:16:22,291 --> 02:16:27,291
And and the technology for forming,
forming opinions that are incorrect

2994
02:16:27,870 --> 02:16:30,000
about your opponent is just better than
it's ever

2995
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,620
been because now they can test that
stuff in real time.

2996
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:37,720
They can put down several ads.
You clicks on what and test the

2997
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:38,554
persuasion.
So,

2998
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:43,770
so the best persuader of 20 fIve years
ago was an amateur compared to the best

2999
02:16:45,041 --> 02:16:48,580
persuader in 2016.
I wonder about that because I think that

3000
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:53,500
jfk was a fucking magnificent persuader.
Have you ever seen jfk speech about

3001
02:16:53,501 --> 02:16:55,600
secret societies?
Uh,

3002
02:16:55,601 --> 02:16:57,100
no,
but I would agree.

3003
02:16:57,101 --> 02:16:59,650
he was great for television because he
was great on television.

3004
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,740
Well,
he had an incredible speech about secret

3005
02:17:02,741 --> 02:17:07,420
societies and the importance of not
having secret societies and government

3006
02:17:07,810 --> 02:17:08,800
and uh,
it,

3007
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:10,480
it was really like,
to this day,

3008
02:17:10,481 --> 02:17:14,170
it's one of those ones that conspiracy
theorists loved bring out and go,

3009
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:15,430
this is why they killed him,
bro.

3010
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:18,490
This is why they killed because I mean,
it may very well be that,

3011
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:21,940
but you know,
he was talking about the importance of

3012
02:17:21,941 --> 02:17:26,941
transparency amongst the government and
amongst the people and how dangerous it

3013
02:17:27,371 --> 02:17:29,710
is to,
to hide secrets and have secret

3014
02:17:29,711 --> 02:17:30,130
societies.

3015
02:17:30,130 --> 02:17:33,520
And it's incredibly,
it's incredibly brilliant.

3016
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:35,980
And it's,
it's amazing because you couldn't

3017
02:17:35,981 --> 02:17:39,850
imagine a president saying that today.
It's like,

3018
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:44,410
do you remember,
I believe it was an eisenhower that had

3019
02:17:44,411 --> 02:17:47,830
the speech about the military industrial
complex before he left office,

3020
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:48,251
right?
Yeah,

3021
02:17:48,251 --> 02:17:49,270
it was eisenhower,
right?

3022
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:53,710
It's an amazing speech,
but it was a speech that he gave one

3023
02:17:53,711 --> 02:17:56,800
night that no one ever saw again until
the internet came around.

3024
02:17:57,090 --> 02:17:59,650
Like it wasn't something you were played
in school.

3025
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:03,350
It wasn't something you even aware about
probably until youtube came along and

3026
02:18:03,351 --> 02:18:05,890
then you watched that thing on youtube
where eisenhower saying,

3027
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:09,700
we must be fearful of the military
industrial complex.

3028
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:12,310
You know,
he waS basically saying there's a whole

3029
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:15,370
machine that wants to go to war and
they're looking for excuses to go to

3030
02:18:15,371 --> 02:18:17,320
war,
and he named it,

3031
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:20,830
you know,
he called it this thing that you would

3032
02:18:20,831 --> 02:18:22,360
never fucking see that today.

3033
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:25,990
You would never see that.
What kennedy did and what eisenhower

3034
02:18:25,991 --> 02:18:28,570
did.
It's almost like they've buttoned down

3035
02:18:28,571 --> 02:18:31,600
those holes.
They found out where those issues were

3036
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:33,790
in the difference in the what,
the,

3037
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:36,310
you know,
what the people that are actually

3038
02:18:36,311 --> 02:18:41,311
running the government want to direct
into project versus these mouthpieces.

3039
02:18:44,110 --> 02:18:48,400
These guys like eisenhower,
kennedy now it sort of the military,

3040
02:18:48,401 --> 02:18:52,680
industrial,
mainstream media conglomerates,

3041
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:54,670
because they all seem to be on the same
side right now.

3042
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:56,870
Sort of,
but aren't the.

3043
02:18:56,871 --> 02:18:59,560
And different sites like fox is
different than cnn.

3044
02:18:59,561 --> 02:19:02,050
Right?
Well fox Is sort of by itself.

3045
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:05,080
Yeah.
I was watching fox and cnn back and

3046
02:19:05,081 --> 02:19:08,020
forth before the,
like before the election I was just

3047
02:19:08,130 --> 02:19:11,950
going to watch fox for like an hour and
then I'd switch over to cnn for an hour

3048
02:19:11,951 --> 02:19:13,450
and I was,
I was getting schizophrenia.

3049
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:16,750
So if you seen how a reality as
bifurcated,

3050
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:20,170
so if he switched between fox and cnn
and fox,

3051
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:25,200
the trump transition team is doing a
terrific job picking real adults,

3052
02:19:26,030 --> 02:19:26,471
blah,
blah,

3053
02:19:26,471 --> 02:19:27,130
blah.

3054
02:19:27,130 --> 02:19:29,180
You go over to cnn,
it's chaos.

3055
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:29,991
It's,
you know,

3056
02:19:29,991 --> 02:19:30,690
there's,
it's,

3057
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:33,500
there's just this big cluster fog going
over there and everything's falling

3058
02:19:33,501 --> 02:19:34,760
apart of the country is going to fall
apart.

3059
02:19:35,570 --> 02:19:39,560
They have access to the same information
as far as I know.

3060
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:42,620
Um,
and those are two completely different

3061
02:19:42,621 --> 02:19:44,510
views of reality.
Yeah.

3062
02:19:44,511 --> 02:19:46,550
There's two completely different views
of reality.

3063
02:19:46,551 --> 02:19:47,520
Also.
Um,

3064
02:19:47,550 --> 02:19:51,860
if I've gone to some liberal sites
websites that are urging people to

3065
02:19:51,861 --> 02:19:56,270
contact the electoral college and block
trump's rise to power,

3066
02:19:56,630 --> 02:20:01,630
like what is that even possible?
And how isn't that anti-democratic like

3067
02:20:02,350 --> 02:20:04,670
to,
to have a few people contact the

3068
02:20:04,671 --> 02:20:07,110
electoral college,
which is like you're talking about like

3069
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:09,770
the representatives,
like every state picture representative,

3070
02:20:09,771 --> 02:20:11,570
that representative is supposed to
represent the state.

3071
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:14,930
They almost always do,
but they have this sort of weird hidden

3072
02:20:14,931 --> 02:20:17,050
power where they could kind of change
the,

3073
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:20,150
like if California voted for clinton,
but they said fuck that.

3074
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:22,850
Trump.
Like if someone actually did decide to

3075
02:20:22,851 --> 02:20:24,140
do that,
some crazy delicate.

3076
02:20:24,210 --> 02:20:26,120
Yeah.
So apparently that power is

3077
02:20:26,121 --> 02:20:30,440
intentionally built in just to prevent a
monster from being,

3078
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:31,281
you know,
didn't,

3079
02:20:31,281 --> 02:20:32,130
weren't elected,
they,

3080
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:33,320
it didn't work,
didn't work.

3081
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:35,480
Uh,
but that's what people are saying like

3082
02:20:35,481 --> 02:20:37,490
let's go.
But that would be,

3083
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:40,310
there would be a revolt in this country
if they ever did that.

3084
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:42,860
Good lord,
if they think it's bad now the

3085
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:44,210
divisiveness and the,
the,

3086
02:20:44,211 --> 02:20:44,780
the,
the,

3087
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:49,100
the angst and this fucking weird line in
the sand across.

3088
02:20:49,410 --> 02:20:51,350
I mean,
it's almost civil war style,

3089
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:53,570
bitcoin between the right and the left
right now.

3090
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:56,630
Well,
some of that might be exaggerated by the

3091
02:20:56,631 --> 02:20:59,510
media as well.
Could be accentuated.

3092
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:00,493
Is,
is.

3093
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:04,430
Yeah.
They're blowing on that fire with the

3094
02:21:04,431 --> 02:21:05,510
protesters.
Be out there.

3095
02:21:05,511 --> 02:21:07,670
If it wasn't an intellivision do you.
What?

3096
02:21:07,671 --> 02:21:09,500
Do you,
what is your opinion on the protest,

3097
02:21:09,501 --> 02:21:10,070
do you think?

3098
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:12,260
I mean,
I've seen ads where they said they would

3099
02:21:12,261 --> 02:21:15,380
pay people 35 bucks an hour to protest.
Is that true or is that bullshit?

3100
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:17,770
I don't know.
I would,

3101
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:22,430
I would say low credibility.
I had heard that you can't snopes things

3102
02:21:22,431 --> 02:21:25,210
anymore because snopes leans towards
hillary.

3103
02:21:25,250 --> 02:21:26,600
Yeah,
I hear that too.

3104
02:21:26,630 --> 02:21:29,480
But where do you hear it though?
From snopes?

3105
02:21:29,490 --> 02:21:33,170
I didn't know either outright forums and
so I would say,

3106
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:35,540
uh,
that one is grain of salt,

3107
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:39,590
but there certainly are things that are
subject to interpretation for sure.

3108
02:21:39,770 --> 02:21:41,570
So you got to figure there's some bias
everywhere.

3109
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:43,370
Yeah.
I wonder if people are really getting

3110
02:21:43,371 --> 02:21:45,390
paid to,
to,

3111
02:21:45,610 --> 02:21:48,170
to protest.
So it seems like a good gig if you're

3112
02:21:48,171 --> 02:21:48,971
broke.
Fuck,

3113
02:21:48,971 --> 02:21:52,410
I think it's just assumed to be true on
the right doors.

3114
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:55,130
They think that this is proven and lots
of different ways.

3115
02:21:55,360 --> 02:21:56,780
Well,
when I was in New York,

3116
02:21:56,830 --> 02:21:58,040
I do,
it may be.

3117
02:21:58,040 --> 02:22:02,090
There was thousands and thousands of
oscar winning actors wandering the

3118
02:22:02,091 --> 02:22:03,920
streets,
but honestly,

3119
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:06,290
to me it didn't seem like anybody was
acting.

3120
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:09,080
It didn't seem like anybody was a paid
performer.

3121
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:10,273
Well,
they wouldn't.

3122
02:22:11,030 --> 02:22:14,690
Most of them could be naturals,
but you need a core that gets everybody

3123
02:22:14,691 --> 02:22:15,410
excited.
You know,

3124
02:22:15,410 --> 02:22:17,930
there's gotta be a core of this shows up
and then other people can.

3125
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:22,640
Or is it that the people that are
willing to take that 35 bucks an hour,

3126
02:22:22,641 --> 02:22:25,260
they hated trump anyway,
and this gives them an excuse to some

3127
02:22:25,261 --> 02:22:29,370
cash while they're hitting trump.
What is this here know someone wasn't

3128
02:22:29,371 --> 02:22:32,850
paid $3,500 to protest Donald Trump.
It's fake news,

3129
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:36,960
uh,
created by paul horner who post fake

3130
02:22:36,961 --> 02:22:39,050
news and a variety of websites.
Oh,

3131
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:41,580
how dare you.
He took credit for the fake news.

3132
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:42,540
Well,
that makes sense.

3133
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:44,850
He goes,
his followers don't fact check anything.

3134
02:22:44,850 --> 02:22:47,100
They'll post everything,
believe anything warner said,

3135
02:22:47,390 --> 02:22:49,620
referring to then trump's campaign
manager,

3136
02:22:49,621 --> 02:22:53,100
corey lewandowski,
horner said his campaign manager posted

3137
02:22:53,101 --> 02:22:56,160
my story about a protest getting paid
$3,500 as a fact.

3138
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:59,210
Like I made that up.
I posted it in a fake ad on craig's

3139
02:22:59,211 --> 02:23:01,710
list.
Here's a screenshot of those since

3140
02:23:01,711 --> 02:23:02,311
deleted.
Tweet.

3141
02:23:02,311 --> 02:23:05,160
That's funny.
So I'm glad I said low credibility

3142
02:23:05,161 --> 02:23:07,830
before you showed that that makes.
That would have been really

3143
02:23:07,831 --> 02:23:10,110
embarrassing.
The amount of money you'd have to have

3144
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:14,640
to pay thousands of people.
Thirty five bucks an hour.

3145
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:16,320
Well,
that supports the.

3146
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:21,030
George soros is behind everything,
which I'm pretty skeptical about.

3147
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:22,430
Yeah.
Um,

3148
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:26,760
what about that peter thiel billionaire
character that funded the lawsuit

3149
02:23:26,761 --> 02:23:28,980
against gawker?
Isn't he in some way,

3150
02:23:28,981 --> 02:23:33,950
shape or form a part of the team?
He's part of the trump transitions.

3151
02:23:34,420 --> 02:23:36,480
I don't know if he's technically on the
transition team.

3152
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:38,400
Yeah,
it's all very interesting.

3153
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:40,920
It's very.
Well there goes the anti gay thing.

3154
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:43,410
Wherever you seen any evidence that he's
anti gay,

3155
02:23:43,770 --> 02:23:46,680
that trump's anti gay.
I am not sure what they're even looking

3156
02:23:46,681 --> 02:23:51,240
at except that he picked a pence as his
running mate in penn says stuff of this

3157
02:23:51,241 --> 02:23:51,871
history.
Yes,

3158
02:23:51,871 --> 02:23:54,090
he does.
He has some stuff that I tweeted the

3159
02:23:54,091 --> 02:23:57,960
other day that rachel maddow was
highlighting that he was saying that

3160
02:23:57,961 --> 02:23:59,790
instead of giving money to aids
research,

3161
02:23:59,791 --> 02:24:03,270
you should give money to educate gay
people about the risks of their

3162
02:24:03,290 --> 02:24:04,950
behavior.
Yeah,

3163
02:24:05,310 --> 02:24:07,050
so ears.
Here's what I think's going to happen.

3164
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:10,320
If you want to put this in the positive
perspective,

3165
02:24:11,490 --> 02:24:15,960
the vice president will adopt the
president's policies,

3166
02:24:15,961 --> 02:24:19,080
at least in public by the time mike
pence,

3167
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:23,610
he might run for president or something.
My guess is that it will be hard coded.

3168
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:26,370
In other words,
this gives them an opportunity to evolve

3169
02:24:26,730 --> 02:24:29,010
to where the country you would find him
more acceptable.

3170
02:24:29,011 --> 02:24:30,360
Anyway.
Show do you want to do that?

3171
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:34,950
And it's sort of a what I call the fake
because it gives them an excuse to do it

3172
02:24:34,951 --> 02:24:36,750
without being a hypocrite because people
say,

3173
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:38,880
yeah,
you had to do that because he's your

3174
02:24:38,881 --> 02:24:39,890
president.
Oh,

3175
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:44,160
now that's just your policy.
So my guess is that trump is moving a

3176
02:24:44,161 --> 02:24:47,280
lot of people to the middle because
that's where he is,

3177
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:51,900
but that pence guys,
he's not very persuasive.

3178
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:54,420
I don't.
I just really have a hard time seeing

3179
02:24:54,421 --> 02:24:56,820
him as being in god's going to run for
president some day.

3180
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,920
I think he might really.
Yeah.

3181
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:00,740
I,
I think as a pick,

3182
02:25:00,850 --> 02:25:04,730
you know,
all I'll say that I'm no fan of his

3183
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:05,700
history with,
you know,

3184
02:25:05,701 --> 02:25:08,010
gay rights stuff and I'm not,
I'm on that team.

3185
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:12,390
Um,
but as a personality on tv,

3186
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:15,870
like he's really good at interviews.
He's really sticks and point and the

3187
02:25:15,871 --> 02:25:19,200
only had one thing you needed to do,
which was when a debate against the

3188
02:25:19,201 --> 02:25:20,640
other vice president,
tim kaine,

3189
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:22,800
which he did.
He's trying to highs emails though.

3190
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:24,240
Well

3191
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:25,073
he's,
yeah,

3192
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:28,810
I'm sure they would all like to be seen
that though.

3193
02:25:29,370 --> 02:25:30,420
That was the latest thing,
right?

3194
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:34,480
Like they want access to his emails.
He's like,

3195
02:25:34,481 --> 02:25:37,010
fuck that,
you know,

3196
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:39,820
we're waiting for that shoe to drop.
Who knows.

3197
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:41,530
I mean,
it's going to come a time when I think

3198
02:25:41,531 --> 02:25:43,780
we're probably all going to have access
to all of our emails.

3199
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:44,751
I mean,
I think you,

3200
02:25:44,751 --> 02:25:47,230
you're going to have to come to the
conclusion that when you're,

3201
02:25:47,231 --> 02:25:50,650
and you should now really,
you should think when you're sending an

3202
02:25:50,651 --> 02:25:52,480
email,
you should assume that this is not

3203
02:25:52,481 --> 02:25:54,700
really private.
I kind of do already,

3204
02:25:54,970 --> 02:25:57,160
first of all,
because someone on the other side who

3205
02:25:57,161 --> 02:25:59,700
gets the Scott Adams,
dick pic co,

3206
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:03,270
we'll check this out and they just,
there's so many out there down and said,

3207
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:04,090
well,
hey man,

3208
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:07,070
already.
So like own it to you.

3209
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:07,750
You know what I mean?

3210
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:08,350
No,
no,

3211
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:09,640
no.
Look what charlie sheen did.

3212
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:11,680
Made a career to own it.
So I've,

3213
02:26:11,681 --> 02:26:15,280
uh,
I've speculated that the perfect world,

3214
02:26:15,281 --> 02:26:18,520
would it be no privacy if everybody knew
everything about everybody?

3215
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:21,940
The worst world is where most people
have privacy,

3216
02:26:21,941 --> 02:26:25,120
but if people lose it because then
they're just victim so everybody could

3217
02:26:25,830 --> 02:26:29,470
but hear any of it.
But everybody knew everybody's shit.

3218
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:31,780
Suddenly you'd be like,
really?

3219
02:26:31,781 --> 02:26:33,790
You're terrible.
I'm terrible too.

3220
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:36,400
I think it would.
I think we would get used to each other

3221
02:26:36,401 --> 02:26:38,650
so quickly.
I think it would also force people to

3222
02:26:38,651 --> 02:26:39,490
evolve.
I mean,

3223
02:26:39,491 --> 02:26:42,040
we all know our best friends stuff,
you know,

3224
02:26:42,041 --> 02:26:43,450
and you know,
we know the,

3225
02:26:43,451 --> 02:26:47,140
the failures and that we all have
together collectively and we still love

3226
02:26:47,141 --> 02:26:49,000
each other,
but it's just like letting those other

3227
02:26:49,001 --> 02:26:51,640
people in on it,
letting those strangers in on the time

3228
02:26:51,641 --> 02:26:55,440
that you had did that bad thing,
but the reason you care is that they'll

3229
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:58,690
think poorly of you and that that will
affect your life,

3230
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:01,060
but if you have mutually assured
destruction,

3231
02:27:01,090 --> 02:27:04,060
which is that everybody's bad because
you know everything about everybody.

3232
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:06,310
You know,
everybody's got something they're proud

3233
02:27:06,311 --> 02:27:08,290
of.
Everybody just thinks,

3234
02:27:08,291 --> 02:27:10,420
well,
I don't think I'll throw a stone because

3235
02:27:10,421 --> 02:27:11,770
it's going to come right back at my
house.

3236
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:14,500
Well,
I think it's step one in this complete

3237
02:27:14,501 --> 02:27:17,680
and total assimilation.
I think losing privacy.

3238
02:27:17,681 --> 02:27:20,980
I agree with you 100 percent.
I think it's inevitable whether it's 30

3239
02:27:20,981 --> 02:27:24,430
years from now or 50 years from now.
I think essentially everything you do

3240
02:27:24,431 --> 02:27:25,490
from then on,
it's going to.

3241
02:27:25,510 --> 02:27:29,830
I think there's going to come some form
of technology that is a leap.

3242
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:31,930
Very much like the internet is this
crazy leap,

3243
02:27:31,931 --> 02:27:33,870
right?
The internet provides us with this

3244
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:37,330
incident,
tanium access to all the answers to all

3245
02:27:37,331 --> 02:27:40,660
the questions you've ever had,
which is just unprecedented in history.

3246
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:42,280
There's never been a time where you say,
well,

3247
02:27:42,281 --> 02:27:45,310
what did happen on the native american
trail of tears?

3248
02:27:45,311 --> 02:27:46,240
Like,
why is it called that?

3249
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:48,940
You can just fucking open your phone to
sit down for a few hours,

3250
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:51,070
and then I came back to you.
What would he got for me,

3251
02:27:51,071 --> 02:27:53,380
Scott?
You could tell me like exactly wHat the

3252
02:27:53,381 --> 02:27:56,260
fuck went down.
This is like unprecedented stuff,

3253
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:00,100
I think in that leap,
which I think we're in the middle of.

3254
02:28:00,101 --> 02:28:02,920
So it seems like it's not as big of a
deal as it really is.

3255
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:06,490
Like there's going to be another leap
that's even more speCtacular than that

3256
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:09,430
and that leap is going to integrate all
of our minds together.

3257
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:12,190
It's going to integrate our memories.
It's going to integrate our ability to

3258
02:28:12,191 --> 02:28:16,630
communicate and we will literally are
going to become a technologically

3259
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:22,040
technologically created hive mind.
I might've written a book that

3260
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,730
has something to say about that.
I'm god's debris.

3261
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:29,270
Um,
what was the idea behind your book?

3262
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:32,420
Um,
if I told you it would ruin your book

3263
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:35,170
reading experience,
but spoiler alert,

3264
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:36,740
can you say that?
Uh,

3265
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:41,270
but I will say that I've had this
thought using periscope because when I'm

3266
02:28:41,271 --> 02:28:44,810
using periscope,
unlike the conscious mind of this

3267
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:47,420
gigantic brain,
which is all the people watching me,

3268
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:50,360
so I can say things like,
hey,

3269
02:28:50,361 --> 02:28:52,550
I think this,
this law might go into effect.

3270
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:53,900
No,
I don't know the answer to that.

3271
02:28:53,901 --> 02:28:57,980
Somebody tells me what the law is.
And within three seconds a period on my

3272
02:28:57,981 --> 02:29:01,370
screen in the periscope session will be
somebody who knows the answer that.

3273
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:06,340
And there's almost nothing I can't throw
out there that there isn't someone under

3274
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:08,690
the thousands of people who were alive
at that moment.

3275
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:11,160
And it's the live part that's
interesting because you can,

3276
02:29:11,210 --> 02:29:12,950
you know,
the internet is kind of like one

3277
02:29:12,951 --> 02:29:14,570
person's alive and the others,
you know,

3278
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:16,430
looking at data on the other side.

3279
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:20,750
but when it's live,
people who are contributing to a thought

3280
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:23,780
and you're watching a forum in real time
on periscope,

3281
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:28,160
it is like a new intelligence has been
created by this technology that's

3282
02:29:28,161 --> 02:29:28,940
temporal.
You know,

3283
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:33,800
as soon as I turned it off it turns off,
but it is a large freaking mind that

3284
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:38,510
multiplies whatever I have going on by
the power of all the people watching.

3285
02:29:38,511 --> 02:29:40,490
It's really,
really thrilling.

3286
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:42,620
But when it's spinning,
how come you have so many people that

3287
02:29:42,621 --> 02:29:45,770
are talking to you so often?
You get thousands of people on there.

3288
02:29:45,771 --> 02:29:47,420
How can you pay attention to those
comments?

3289
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:48,680
Well,
I can't watch them all.

3290
02:29:48,681 --> 02:29:51,710
So if someone has a good answer,
well I usually,

3291
02:29:51,711 --> 02:29:54,800
if I,
I try to ask a question and then I look.

3292
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:58,280
But otherwise if I'm talking and I'm
focusing on what I'm saying,

3293
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:00,110
but when you're looking at their answer
d,

3294
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:01,670
can you click on that answer?

3295
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:03,920
Can you freeze your screen or something
like that.

3296
02:30:03,921 --> 02:30:06,500
So like,
because it's like I see how it works.

3297
02:30:06,700 --> 02:30:09,420
Like,
um,

3298
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:12,890
usually what happens is something go
past so quickly.

3299
02:30:12,891 --> 02:30:14,150
I'll say I missed it,
I missed it.

3300
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:16,430
Say that again.
And I look forward to it comes back.

3301
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:17,810
Uh,
the reason why I asked,

3302
02:30:17,811 --> 02:30:19,640
because we did something similar
yesterday.

3303
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:23,360
We have this tri caster that runs a
video stream on youtube,

3304
02:30:23,361 --> 02:30:27,470
that multicolored keyboard lit up,
christmas lights looking thing.

3305
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:30,740
That fucking thing is crashed two days
in a row on us in the middle of

3306
02:30:30,770 --> 02:30:34,610
broadcast where it never crashed before.
Now jamie updated all the software and

3307
02:30:34,611 --> 02:30:36,890
we're hoping it doesn't do it again in
this show has been fine,

3308
02:30:37,310 --> 02:30:38,180
but I said,
well,

3309
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:40,610
if anybody knows a better solution,
please let us know.

3310
02:30:40,820 --> 02:30:43,340
And so proud.
The comments were just filled on

3311
02:30:43,341 --> 02:30:46,700
instagram with all these really good
solutions and a few of them,

3312
02:30:46,701 --> 02:30:48,410
few the machines look pretty bad ass.

3313
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:49,880
So I mean,
who knows what,

3314
02:30:49,990 --> 02:30:51,650
we'll have to research,
find out what's the best,

3315
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:55,460
but that when have you ever been able to
do that before and you know some.

3316
02:30:55,570 --> 02:30:59,780
There's a bunch of dumb answers,
but somewhere in there is probably the

3317
02:30:59,781 --> 02:31:00,950
right answer.
You know,

3318
02:31:00,951 --> 02:31:05,900
in some person who's an expert.
Like if somebody asked a question and it

3319
02:31:05,901 --> 02:31:08,780
was on an insert,
a instagram forum or an instagram

3320
02:31:08,990 --> 02:31:11,340
picture and it had something to do with
being cartoonist,

3321
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:13,700
well who better to ask than the guy who
created dilbert?

3322
02:31:13,701 --> 02:31:18,620
You would be able to answer and give
your your expert opinion on how this

3323
02:31:18,621 --> 02:31:20,230
works or that works.
I

3324
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:23,040
think also our government is going to
run that way.

3325
02:31:24,210 --> 02:31:28,470
At least if trump is a transparent sort
of public president like I think he will

3326
02:31:28,471 --> 02:31:30,210
be.
I think there's going to be a lot of

3327
02:31:30,211 --> 02:31:35,211
policies that get created in this sort
of collective brain that is trump

3328
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:40,320
leading the discussion and the entire
public weighing in through social media

3329
02:31:40,321 --> 02:31:45,321
and mainstream media in every other way.
I think he can do that and probably will

3330
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:51,000
and it's going to be like this thrilling
experience of watching good thoughts

3331
02:31:51,001 --> 02:31:51,860
turn into better thoughts.

3332
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:55,640
Boy,
that is the rose colored glasses view of

3333
02:31:55,641 --> 02:31:57,350
the trump presidency.
If I've ever heard one,

3334
02:31:57,380 --> 02:32:01,010
that Would be the best case scenario and
also that he wants.

3335
02:32:01,070 --> 02:32:03,860
Now that he's in the office once he's no
longer in contention,

3336
02:32:04,190 --> 02:32:06,470
now he's the president,
so now he's fighting with any way the

3337
02:32:06,471 --> 02:32:09,140
same way anymore.
But what people are worried about is

3338
02:32:09,141 --> 02:32:14,141
people that write things about him.
Like if people write poor reviews of his

3339
02:32:14,511 --> 02:32:16,160
presidency,
that they're going to be attacked.

3340
02:32:16,550 --> 02:32:19,130
They're worried about getting sued,
they're worried about being targeted.

3341
02:32:19,131 --> 02:32:23,350
They worry about the fact that he's in
control of the nsa and he can,

3342
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:25,460
you know,
he could hire some edward snowden type

3343
02:32:25,461 --> 02:32:28,310
character to fuck up your life if you
write an article about them for the wall

3344
02:32:28,311 --> 02:32:30,070
street journal or something,
you know.

3345
02:32:30,380 --> 02:32:31,210
Uh,
well,

3346
02:32:31,210 --> 02:32:33,040
um,
I talk about this as well.

3347
02:32:33,130 --> 02:32:35,650
If you look at any individually thing,
he does like,

3348
02:32:35,651 --> 02:32:38,110
hey,
it's 3:00 AM and I'm tweeting about,

3349
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:40,180
you know,
miss universe or something.

3350
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:43,210
I always imagined them with the socks on
in the lazy chair,

3351
02:32:43,211 --> 02:32:43,601
right?
Yeah.

3352
02:32:43,601 --> 02:32:47,950
Like a boxer shorts with a boner angry,
no shirt,

3353
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:53,400
red face screaming well on is doing
something with the kid and better yet

3354
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:56,980
barefoot with yellow toenails.
I imagine he doesn't take care of his

3355
02:32:56,981 --> 02:33:00,970
feet.
uh,

3356
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:05,440
but what he does is he a,
he praises and rewards people who are

3357
02:33:05,441 --> 02:33:07,450
good,
good to him especially.

3358
02:33:07,730 --> 02:33:10,150
And he attacks without,
without exception.

3359
02:33:10,450 --> 02:33:13,740
He just never makes an exception.
He will attack you if you go after him.

3360
02:33:13,960 --> 02:33:17,000
He doesn't start the fight,
but he likes to finish it.

3361
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:21,880
I think bill burroughs one who said that
he would have those black socks on.

3362
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:23,630
I might've.
I might've co-opted that.

3363
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:24,970
I'm thinking of.
He might've said,

3364
02:33:24,980 --> 02:33:26,320
well,
we're drunk durinG the end of the world

3365
02:33:26,321 --> 02:33:31,290
podcast if you haven't heard that.
We get a podcast while the presidency

3366
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:33,910
was being called and bill burr was on
fire.

3367
02:33:34,330 --> 02:33:37,150
It was on fire.
It was one of the funniest podcast ever,

3368
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:39,370
but It was all like watching it all go
down.

3369
02:33:39,630 --> 02:33:42,220
At one time he got into an argument with
the other comedians,

3370
02:33:42,221 --> 02:33:45,920
sarah tiana,
because tiana was talking about how uh,

3371
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,840
anybody who supports trump is a racist
and sexist and then.

3372
02:33:49,330 --> 02:33:52,330
And then bill made fun of it and it was
just,

3373
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:55,420
it was perfect.
It was the perfect thing to see why it

3374
02:33:55,421 --> 02:33:58,360
was all going down.
It was like you were seeing in bill and

3375
02:33:58,361 --> 02:34:00,580
her.
You're seeing it in a physical form the

3376
02:34:00,581 --> 02:34:02,290
Way people are choosing to frame this
thing.

3377
02:34:03,670 --> 02:34:06,160
Fascinating.
I'll watch that.

3378
02:34:06,520 --> 02:34:07,360
yeah.
Anyway,

3379
02:34:07,361 --> 02:34:10,900
I was just saying trump likes to leave
the biggest gap between pleasing him,

3380
02:34:10,930 --> 02:34:14,140
end up pleasing him and it has nothing
to do with the thing he's fighting about

3381
02:34:14,141 --> 02:34:16,660
it at the moment.
It's about setting it up so that the

3382
02:34:16,661 --> 02:34:18,040
next who's thinking should

3383
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,460
I fuck with him?
That didn't work for the last 700

3384
02:34:21,461 --> 02:34:26,461
people,
but if it had worked for some people to

3385
02:34:26,501 --> 02:34:28,860
fuck with him in the past,
you would be tempted.

3386
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:29,471
You like,
well,

3387
02:34:29,471 --> 02:34:32,080
sometimes people get away with it.
This is a different thing though.

3388
02:34:32,081 --> 02:34:35,170
Once you're the president versus once
you're just some billionaire

3389
02:34:36,970 --> 02:34:38,440
real estate tycoon.
Because there was.

3390
02:34:38,710 --> 02:34:43,710
There was one guy that was writing about
it where he had been sued by trump and

3391
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:46,540
when.
Because he wrote an article and when

3392
02:34:46,541 --> 02:34:51,541
they started examining the actual data
it got pretty ugly pretty quick and then

3393
02:34:51,911 --> 02:34:56,911
they abandoned the lawsuit and this guy
trump wound up getting him a seat for

3394
02:34:58,031 --> 02:35:01,690
the fights.
Like he got him a ticket and I think he

3395
02:35:01,691 --> 02:35:06,430
flew him out to atlantic city and maybe
someone with them as well for the fights

3396
02:35:06,431 --> 02:35:07,510
and that became like an issue.

3397
02:35:08,010 --> 02:35:09,010
Like,
yeah,

3398
02:35:09,190 --> 02:35:11,200
what,
how does that connect with the.

3399
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:13,000
I'm missing the string there.
Well,

3400
02:35:13,001 --> 02:35:15,430
just you know that he's just a master
manipulator.

3401
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:20,260
Like in the middle of this,
he has this lawsuit thing with this guy,

3402
02:35:20,350 --> 02:35:23,050
you know,
and the guy calls him a shithead or

3403
02:35:23,051 --> 02:35:25,150
whatever you called them and writes this
article about him.

3404
02:35:25,450 --> 02:35:30,450
Trump get some tickets to some fight.
Susan loses in court or loses the,

3405
02:35:30,881 --> 02:35:32,530
you know,
when they're going through all the data,

3406
02:35:32,531 --> 02:35:35,200
they abandoned the lawsuit.
Trump gets of tickets to the fight with

3407
02:35:35,201 --> 02:35:39,250
the whole thing is just crazy.
It's probably all part of rewarding

3408
02:35:39,251 --> 02:35:41,410
people and punishing people so that you.
Yes,

3409
02:35:41,430 --> 02:35:45,200
you feel there's a state game of thrones
type shit that came with us.

3410
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:48,070
It doesn't look like.
I was just thinking of that in the

3411
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:51,010
weirdly as I was doing something the
other day,

3412
02:35:51,490 --> 02:35:56,410
I was thinking that you could map all
these family dynasties unto the game of

3413
02:35:56,411 --> 02:35:57,720
thrones thing.

3414
02:35:58,030 --> 02:36:01,960
You could in some way.
I mean it is bizarre in to the extreme

3415
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:06,400
that we've dealt with these family
dynasties like the bush family in.

3416
02:36:06,430 --> 02:36:08,560
We almost did it again with jeb.
You know,

3417
02:36:08,561 --> 02:36:10,270
I mean,
who knows if it wasn't for trump,

3418
02:36:10,271 --> 02:36:14,680
if trump wasn't around and he didn't
come up with that low energy jeb things

3419
02:36:14,681 --> 02:36:15,300
that,
what you called them?

3420
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:16,133
YeAh,
low energy.

3421
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:19,630
If he didn't see.
And also jeff just sucked.

3422
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:21,490
I mean when,
when the pressure was on,

3423
02:36:21,491 --> 02:36:23,830
he just wasn't good.
This wasn't good.

3424
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:26,020
It wasn't.
And when all that stuff was going down

3425
02:36:26,021 --> 02:36:28,470
or like rick perry,
like when remembering rick perry's in

3426
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:29,620
debates,
you just didn't know what the fuck he

3427
02:36:29,621 --> 02:36:30,460
was talking about.
He's like,

3428
02:36:30,910 --> 02:36:33,730
what was I even saying?
Like that's it,

3429
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:38,620
you're done.
But if it wasn't for that happening with

3430
02:36:38,621 --> 02:36:41,230
jeb bush,
he might have very well gotten the same

3431
02:36:41,231 --> 02:36:43,710
position that donald got into.

3432
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:45,160
I mean,
when you looked at all the other people,

3433
02:36:45,161 --> 02:36:48,400
he least had that familiar name.
People might've been inclined.

3434
02:36:48,401 --> 02:36:53,401
He didn't have any real crazy like
horrible stories in the past that got

3435
02:36:55,091 --> 02:36:57,610
brought up immediately.
He could very well and they would have

3436
02:36:57,611 --> 02:37:00,780
continued that family dynasty.
The clinton family dynasties another

3437
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:02,100
disturbing one.
You know,

3438
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:04,060
that's a weird dynasty,
you know,

3439
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:08,140
is a chelsea next is Michelle Obama
next.

3440
02:37:08,230 --> 02:37:09,520
Oh yeah,
I think she's definitely.

3441
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:10,930
That's the question,
man.

3442
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:13,180
That's the big question.
She would be excellent.

3443
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:17,660
She would.
She's like a reallY good speaker.

3444
02:37:17,661 --> 02:37:21,200
She's very intelligent.
She's very articulate.

3445
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:25,430
she's a very measured and composed and
stately and

3446
02:37:25,610 --> 02:37:27,910
as mcgregor said,
and the fight,

3447
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:30,830
She has lots of attributes.
She has a lot of attributes.

3448
02:37:30,831 --> 02:37:31,380
Yeah.

3449
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:32,041
Yeah.
I mean,

3450
02:37:32,041 --> 02:37:37,041
and she carrIed herself extremely well
for eight years in the white house under

3451
02:37:37,291 --> 02:37:38,670
some incredible pressure.
I mean,

3452
02:37:38,671 --> 02:37:40,490
I dunno what she,
what her,

3453
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:43,230
you know,
her responsibilities were what our days

3454
02:37:43,231 --> 02:37:46,110
looked like,
but she's never made a misstep.

3455
02:37:46,230 --> 02:37:48,540
There was never,
never been an embarrassing interview.

3456
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:49,553
Never important.
yeah.

3457
02:37:49,570 --> 02:37:53,790
Nothing much less controversial than
hillary clinton.

3458
02:37:54,090 --> 02:37:55,770
Much less,
you know,

3459
02:37:55,771 --> 02:37:58,260
because even before the,
uh,

3460
02:37:58,380 --> 02:38:01,290
like she tried to run for president,
there was always the whitewater thing

3461
02:38:01,291 --> 02:38:04,380
that she was connected through the vince
foster thing that she was connected to.

3462
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:06,060
HAve you seen that meme?
You know,

3463
02:38:06,061 --> 02:38:09,930
they're doing all these joe biden memes.
Have you seen the recent joe biden meme

3464
02:38:10,530 --> 02:38:13,620
the one with and see if you could find
it?

3465
02:38:13,830 --> 02:38:16,050
I think I retweeted it.
I retweeted it yesterday.

3466
02:38:16,140 --> 02:38:18,250
Somebody tweeted it it to me,
um,

3467
02:38:18,330 --> 02:38:19,163
it was,
um,

3468
02:38:19,740 --> 02:38:23,320
joe biden and obama laughing about,
uh,

3469
02:38:24,270 --> 02:38:27,990
about hillary having something in common
with monica lewinsky now.

3470
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:31,200
Yeah.
Pull it up so you can say you could see

3471
02:38:31,201 --> 02:38:31,920
it.
I don't want to blow it.

3472
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,660
Check this out.
Look at this.

3473
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:36,330
Look joe.
Then it says joe.

3474
02:38:36,331 --> 02:38:37,500
Then I said,
hillary.

3475
02:38:37,830 --> 02:38:40,250
Now you and monica have something else
in common.

3476
02:38:40,290 --> 02:38:43,050
You blew it.
And then obama and he's laughing.

3477
02:38:43,051 --> 02:38:46,110
Throws his head back laughing and
obama's look at that and look with his

3478
02:38:46,111 --> 02:38:47,800
eyebrows raised and it says,
you know,

3479
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:48,810
she kills people,
right?

3480
02:38:53,010 --> 02:38:56,490
These are fucking great.
Do you think she's killed anybody?

3481
02:38:58,470 --> 02:39:03,360
That kid that got shot outside of his
apartment at 4:00 in the morning or they

3482
02:39:03,361 --> 02:39:05,790
didn't take his cell phone.
they didn't take his wallet.

3483
02:39:05,791 --> 02:39:09,750
They didn't take his money and he,
according to wikileaks,

3484
02:39:09,751 --> 02:39:13,470
was the one that leaked all those
documents about the dnc and the dnc

3485
02:39:13,471 --> 02:39:15,930
favoring hillary clinton over bernie
sanders.

3486
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:19,320
Who knows what else that guy knew.
If that was the guy,

3487
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:20,550
if that is the case,

3488
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:25,870
I don't know,
but it seem more likely that even if

3489
02:39:25,871 --> 02:39:29,020
they were murderers because of some
hillary clinton,

3490
02:39:29,021 --> 02:39:31,240
the connection that she wouldn't know
about it.

3491
02:39:31,450 --> 02:39:33,130
perhaps just somebody who thought,
well,

3492
02:39:33,131 --> 02:39:37,660
I'm going to change history.
You do a favor perhaps perhaps,

3493
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:41,770
but this is also the woman who was
attributed in an email.

3494
02:39:41,771 --> 02:39:46,150
Whether or not it's correct.
She said about julian assan,

3495
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:49,960
can't we just drone that guy?
This guy is some thumbing his nose that

3496
02:39:49,961 --> 02:39:53,680
America can't.
We just drone him so I don't want to

3497
02:39:53,681 --> 02:39:56,620
drone him because I think he's done a
great service.

3498
02:39:57,130 --> 02:39:59,800
But from the butts,
from the,

3499
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:04,990
from the context of a government looking
at this situation,

3500
02:40:05,170 --> 02:40:08,170
if government secrets have been stolen
and It's your job to,

3501
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:10,410
you know,
make sure this doesn't happen and you

3502
02:40:10,411 --> 02:40:11,590
know,
to get justice.

3503
02:40:11,950 --> 02:40:13,980
That's actually kind a fair question.

3504
02:40:14,290 --> 02:40:16,500
No,
I wouldn't want because you're saying

3505
02:40:16,501 --> 02:40:18,300
what are all our options?
Well,

3506
02:40:18,301 --> 02:40:20,880
it could be off the cuff,
flippant statement that she didn't

3507
02:40:20,881 --> 02:40:22,650
really take serious.
Like can we just drone him?

3508
02:40:23,370 --> 02:40:25,980
But she said some creepy shit.
Like one of the things that she said

3509
02:40:25,981 --> 02:40:28,980
about gadhafi,
you ever see that interview where she's

3510
02:40:28,981 --> 02:40:29,850
talking about.
She goes,

3511
02:40:29,851 --> 02:40:31,800
we came,
we saw he died.

3512
02:40:31,801 --> 02:40:33,000
Ha ha,
ha ha.

3513
02:40:33,810 --> 02:40:37,350
Yeah.
That was a startling and shocking is

3514
02:40:37,351 --> 02:40:39,690
after she hit her head.
Oh really?

3515
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:42,180
Yes.
that would explain.

3516
02:40:42,181 --> 02:40:43,740
It wouldn't 100 percent.
Yeah,

3517
02:40:44,130 --> 02:40:48,300
very irrational to think that way and
I'm very impulsive to to say that out

3518
02:40:48,301 --> 02:40:52,710
loud because you're dealing with the
dissolving of a nation.

3519
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:58,040
Libya is in complete total turmoil and
has become a breeding ground for isis

3520
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:03,180
and a lot of that can be attributed to
it being completely destabilized by the

3521
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:06,600
United States,
helping out all the people that wound up

3522
02:41:06,601 --> 02:41:07,440
killing gaddafi.

3523
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:10,200
It doesn't mean good.
Naafi wasn't a huge piece of shit and

3524
02:41:10,201 --> 02:41:12,690
the world is in better because he's dead
probably is,

3525
02:41:12,691 --> 02:41:16,830
but Libya is not better right now.
Like olivia became completely unstable

3526
02:41:16,831 --> 02:41:20,160
after that so that he came,
we came,

3527
02:41:20,490 --> 02:41:22,420
we saw he died.
Ha ha,

3528
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:25,410
ha ha.
That's like laughing in the face of

3529
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:29,400
these poor unfortunate people who just
got a shit,

3530
02:41:29,401 --> 02:41:33,580
roll the dice and grew up in Libya and
now they're stuck there and then the

3531
02:41:33,610 --> 02:41:38,280
right side of the character from how
skilled the politician she is to say

3532
02:41:38,281 --> 02:41:40,820
something that's so clearly the wrong
thing to say at throwing.

3533
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:42,510
Well,
wHen was the fall of Libya?

3534
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:44,550
Was that 13 or 14?

3535
02:41:46,710 --> 02:41:49,710
When did a find out when gaddafi died?
When gaddafi was killed?

3536
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:50,940
What?
I'll never forget it.

3537
02:41:50,941 --> 02:41:53,670
I'll tell you that that video is fucking
terrifying.

3538
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:56,830
The video of the rebels capturing him
and they're sticking things up.

3539
02:41:56,831 --> 02:41:58,650
His assets.
Two thousand 11,

3540
02:42:00,090 --> 02:42:05,090
I believe the interview with her was in
2012 or 13.

3541
02:42:05,671 --> 02:42:09,330
See if you could find that out.
If it's in 2012 or 13,

3542
02:42:09,331 --> 02:42:14,331
it's entirely possible that this is
directly post concussion and a severe

3543
02:42:15,780 --> 02:42:17,520
bleeding.
Apparently on her brain,

3544
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:20,940
she had some serious problems.
She's fucked up for like 12 months.

3545
02:42:20,941 --> 02:42:24,780
I don't think people realize that that
can permanently change your personality

3546
02:42:25,050 --> 02:42:27,900
permanently.
The the average person doesn't thInk

3547
02:42:27,901 --> 02:42:30,270
that's a thing,
but I've seen it.

3548
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:31,680
You know,
I have as well,

3549
02:42:31,710 --> 02:42:32,521
I've seen it many,
many,

3550
02:42:32,521 --> 02:42:36,330
many times because I'm in the head
trauma business in a lot of ways because

3551
02:42:36,331 --> 02:42:38,700
of my experience with the ufc.

3552
02:42:39,170 --> 02:42:41,100
Um,
but I know people that have been hitting

3553
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:43,290
the head outside of the ufc and have
never been the same.

3554
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:46,620
Um,
that is one of the things that I've

3555
02:42:46,621 --> 02:42:50,010
always said about sam kinison.
Sam kennison had a great book written

3556
02:42:50,011 --> 02:42:53,790
about him by his brother called my
brother sam or brother sam.

3557
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:55,620
It's a great book,
especially for me,

3558
02:42:55,710 --> 02:42:59,430
huge kennison fan,
but he basically says sam was one person

3559
02:42:59,640 --> 02:43:03,570
and then he got hit by a truck when he
was a little kid and became a completely

3560
02:43:03,571 --> 02:43:06,930
different person.
Became reckless and wild and it came out

3561
02:43:06,931 --> 02:43:08,580
of a head injury.
Oh yeah.

3562
02:43:08,581 --> 02:43:11,650
The lack of control didn't give a fuck.

3563
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:14,410
That's where it came from.
Well,

3564
02:43:14,470 --> 02:43:16,780
yeah,
like literally from brain trauma.

3565
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:18,273
What is it?

3566
02:43:18,450 --> 02:43:20,050
Yes.
This video that's got a million and a

3567
02:43:20,051 --> 02:43:22,510
half to 2011 was uploaded the exact same
day.

3568
02:43:22,511 --> 02:43:23,920
It says he died.
Oh,

3569
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:24,940
okay.
Possible.

3570
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:27,950
That she already interviewed and was
recorded and put.

3571
02:43:28,030 --> 02:43:29,680
This was up on,
I mean It may be possible.

3572
02:43:29,681 --> 02:43:33,610
It happened like that morning.
That doesn't seem right.

3573
02:43:34,710 --> 02:43:36,950
Yeah.
Especially if you're saying that this

3574
02:43:36,950 --> 02:43:39,050
same day as.
Maybe that's why she's giddy,

3575
02:43:39,051 --> 02:43:43,430
but if that is the case,
well why don't you find out because this

3576
02:43:43,431 --> 02:43:45,500
is just one.
It says 1 million,

3577
02:43:45,501 --> 02:43:50,000
542,000 cbs news interview with hillary
clinton.

3578
02:43:50,060 --> 02:43:52,100
There it goes.
Laughed about killing gaddafi.

3579
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:56,000
Go to that.
That's for 2016 and let's see when it

3580
02:43:56,001 --> 02:44:01,001
says it says flash back.
Maybe it was like right after and she

3581
02:44:01,131 --> 02:44:02,720
was so giddy.
But if that's the case,

3582
02:44:03,140 --> 02:44:05,480
the link to that video I just pulled up.
Okay,

3583
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:08,870
so if that's the.
But what does it say in that article and

3584
02:44:08,871 --> 02:44:10,670
that article that you're reading before
you click on it,

3585
02:44:10,671 --> 02:44:12,510
see flashlIght right there.
You like,

3586
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:17,540
what does it say there?
Well he died in 2011 and she supposedly

3587
02:44:17,541 --> 02:44:22,541
had the big head injury in 2012.
So you can't even blame It on that.

3588
02:44:22,641 --> 02:44:24,170
Then I'll look into it.

3589
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:27,260
If that's the case,
you can't really blame it on that

3590
02:44:27,261 --> 02:44:29,540
because that means that she hit her head
after this.

3591
02:44:30,020 --> 02:44:32,600
She's laughing probably about gaddafi
died and she fell.

3592
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:35,960
Maybe when you laugh really hard and
you're not that healthy,

3593
02:44:36,080 --> 02:44:41,080
she was drinking or or do you think she
loses it up but were saying Scott Adams?

3594
02:44:41,310 --> 02:44:42,740
Well,
you can't rule that out.

3595
02:44:43,310 --> 02:44:44,900
Definitely can't.
She doesn't look too healthy.

3596
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:47,330
She's definitely not eating the best
foods.

3597
02:44:47,510 --> 02:44:49,490
You know?
I was saying that no matter how much she

3598
02:44:49,491 --> 02:44:53,010
drinks,
if she is a social drinker and you know,

3599
02:44:53,090 --> 02:44:55,730
people were just social drinkers who
have had two drinks,

3600
02:44:55,731 --> 02:44:58,370
let's say you don't want them driving.
Right?

3601
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:02,960
So why isn't that disqualifying for
somebody who's going to be in control of

3602
02:45:02,961 --> 02:45:04,910
the nuclear arsenal?
Who admits?

3603
02:45:04,911 --> 02:45:06,740
Yes,
I'm a social drinker now.

3604
02:45:06,741 --> 02:45:10,190
In the past you never had to ask that
question because it was too social

3605
02:45:10,191 --> 02:45:13,280
drinkers running against each other.
So you're going to get a social drinker

3606
02:45:13,310 --> 02:45:16,280
no matter who got elected.
But trump's the first time you had a non

3607
02:45:16,281 --> 02:45:17,750
drinker.
He doesn't drink at all.

3608
02:45:17,810 --> 02:45:18,670
No,
no,

3609
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:21,110
no.
He hasn't had a sip of alcohol in his

3610
02:45:21,111 --> 02:45:22,850
life really,
or a drug.

3611
02:45:22,851 --> 02:45:25,340
He claims I'd like to get them drunk and
high.

3612
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:26,293
How about that?

3613
02:45:26,650 --> 02:45:31,030
This issue was being interviewed in
Afghanistan on that day and news hit so

3614
02:45:31,031 --> 02:45:33,870
that,
I guess that video was not being taped

3615
02:45:34,010 --> 02:45:37,760
or it wasn't a supposed to be taped,
but it was like an unfair kind of

3616
02:45:37,950 --> 02:45:38,440
record.
Yeah,

3617
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:39,670
it was definitely an unfair recording,

3618
02:45:40,070 --> 02:45:43,550
but so,
so that was like right when it happened,

3619
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:45,860
but she was laughing about it right when
it happened,

3620
02:45:45,890 --> 02:45:48,850
but that explains why she was out of
character for her normal.

3621
02:45:48,870 --> 02:45:50,210
Yes.
That does make sense.

3622
02:45:50,211 --> 02:45:52,490
She was giddy.
It was off camera that they just killed

3623
02:45:52,491 --> 02:45:54,440
this guy and she was off camera.
Yeah,

3624
02:45:55,340 --> 02:45:57,830
that makes sense.
That's a lot more logical.

3625
02:45:57,860 --> 02:46:00,140
I'm glad that we solve this.
We solved it.

3626
02:46:00,170 --> 02:46:02,870
We should be detective Scott Adams.
Um,

3627
02:46:03,410 --> 02:46:07,250
we solved a lot of things today I think.
I think we cleared up a lot of people's

3628
02:46:07,251 --> 02:46:10,040
misconceptions about you that not only
did not vote for trump,

3629
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:13,820
you don't vote.
You were essentially just looking at

3630
02:46:13,821 --> 02:46:17,360
this thing as a,
a person who knows a lot about

3631
02:46:17,361 --> 02:46:21,650
persuasion and knows a lot about public
speaking and what you were looking at

3632
02:46:21,651 --> 02:46:22,940
this and you were going,
this is,

3633
02:46:22,941 --> 02:46:25,100
um,
you're almost like watching a game.

3634
02:46:25,170 --> 02:46:26,960
You're watching a game play out,
and if you say,

3635
02:46:26,961 --> 02:46:28,760
look,
the raiders are going to slaughter the

3636
02:46:28,761 --> 02:46:30,870
dolphins.
It doesn't mean you hate the dolphins,

3637
02:46:30,930 --> 02:46:34,220
means you're looking at the actual law,
that defensive line,

3638
02:46:34,221 --> 02:46:35,390
the offense,
the quarterback.

3639
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:37,190
I see where this game is going to go.

3640
02:46:37,330 --> 02:46:41,230
I thought when this whole thing started
developing the trump candidacy,

3641
02:46:41,710 --> 02:46:45,970
that would open a crack in the universe
where I could talk about this persuasion

3642
02:46:45,971 --> 02:46:49,120
stuff and be believed and in order to be
believed,

3643
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:54,600
my technique for that was last year I
predicted so that when the day came,

3644
02:46:54,791 --> 02:46:57,610
when I was right,
I would have enough credibility to say,

3645
02:46:57,611 --> 02:46:59,050
okay,
so the other things I said,

3646
02:46:59,080 --> 02:47:00,580
maybe you should pay attention to them
too.

3647
02:47:01,270 --> 02:47:04,240
So it was sort of a long game.
I was playing for credibility.

3648
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:07,690
And um,
I thought that persuasion would be the

3649
02:47:07,691 --> 02:47:08,710
most important variable.

3650
02:47:09,490 --> 02:47:11,540
It's certainly a huge variable in this
world,

3651
02:47:11,830 --> 02:47:14,240
um,
as is what we discussed earlier,

3652
02:47:14,241 --> 02:47:17,150
the ability to speak publicly with
confidence,

3653
02:47:17,570 --> 02:47:20,720
not just persuasion,
but just to not look rattled.

3654
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:23,550
you know,
even if you're not persuaded like you

3655
02:47:23,551 --> 02:47:26,420
don't,
he's not getting defeated even when he's

3656
02:47:26,421 --> 02:47:29,060
losing.
and I would see like these debates and I

3657
02:47:29,061 --> 02:47:29,481
would say,
well,

3658
02:47:29,481 --> 02:47:32,470
she made some salient points.
She seemed more articulate.

3659
02:47:32,471 --> 02:47:34,850
she seemed smoother with her words.
She seemed more stately,

3660
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:38,840
but he never felt like he lost.
He didn't act like he lost.

3661
02:47:39,170 --> 02:47:39,820
That's giant

3662
02:47:39,820 --> 02:47:40,690
to.
Yeah.

3663
02:47:40,730 --> 02:47:42,230
People.
People are,

3664
02:47:42,250 --> 02:47:44,060
you know,
they pick up their feelings for other

3665
02:47:44,061 --> 02:47:45,440
people.
We just look at them and say,

3666
02:47:45,441 --> 02:47:46,274
hey,
he's happy.

3667
02:47:46,310 --> 02:47:48,530
So happy.
Just picking that up.

3668
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:51,950
People walk in the room and they're
downers and your energy goes down as

3669
02:47:51,951 --> 02:47:52,784
soon as they enter.

3670
02:47:53,100 --> 02:47:57,420
Watching someone super uncomfortable or
unsuccessful is very.

3671
02:47:57,421 --> 02:48:00,200
It's hard to do like watching someone
bomb on stage.

3672
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:01,180
Very hard

3673
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:02,100
do.
Uh,

3674
02:48:02,550 --> 02:48:06,030
one of,
one of my great moments when I started

3675
02:48:06,031 --> 02:48:10,710
to understand the world better is the
first time I smoked pot in college.

3676
02:48:10,890 --> 02:48:14,930
And for most of my college experience,
I found,

3677
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:20,060
I found this weird pattern that people
were nicer to me if I had just gotten

3678
02:48:20,281 --> 02:48:25,281
high and it was years before I realized
that I was causing them to be nice

3679
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:28,470
because you were nicer to them.
I was just relaxed and you were given a

3680
02:48:28,471 --> 02:48:29,900
better vibe out.
Gave anthony died.

3681
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:34,590
And I realized that I can,
I can control how they act simply by my

3682
02:48:34,591 --> 02:48:35,424
emotional state.

3683
02:48:35,790 --> 02:48:39,360
Well definitely we control how people
react to us based on what kind of.

3684
02:48:39,430 --> 02:48:42,450
And I've given off the wrong energy
before and you see it in people,

3685
02:48:42,451 --> 02:48:42,691
you know,
like,

3686
02:48:42,691 --> 02:48:43,950
ah fuck,
you know,

3687
02:48:43,951 --> 02:48:46,680
like maybe you're too caught up in what
you're doing and you don't want to be

3688
02:48:46,681 --> 02:48:50,040
bothered or whatever it is.
We've all been there before.

3689
02:48:50,041 --> 02:48:52,470
And then we've all been on the opposite
where maybe someone's like,

3690
02:48:52,471 --> 02:48:53,490
this guy's a dick.
And I'm like,

3691
02:48:53,491 --> 02:48:55,290
really?
I just had a wonderful,

3692
02:48:55,291 --> 02:48:59,460
pleasant conversation with him because
you interface with them in the perfect

3693
02:48:59,461 --> 02:49:01,860
way,
at the right time with respect.

3694
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:05,700
And the guy lord his guard and you know,
and gave a little back to you and you

3695
02:49:05,701 --> 02:49:07,550
gave more to him and everybody's good.
We,

3696
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:09,900
I've seen,
I think we've all experienced both of

3697
02:49:09,901 --> 02:49:14,370
those things and I think that's one of
the problems with one person accounts of

3698
02:49:14,371 --> 02:49:15,990
any bad thing that went on.

3699
02:49:15,990 --> 02:49:17,910
Like can I.
And I've looked at some of this trump

3700
02:49:17,911 --> 02:49:18,960
stuff and I'm like,
man,

3701
02:49:18,961 --> 02:49:20,430
what?
What really did happen?

3702
02:49:20,431 --> 02:49:23,040
What really did happen with the clinton
accusations?

3703
02:49:23,041 --> 02:49:25,860
What was really going down between these
two people because one of them is

3704
02:49:25,861 --> 02:49:27,990
talking about and the other one isn't
and we don't know what the fuck the

3705
02:49:27,991 --> 02:49:31,020
answer is.
And I think that that's often the case.

3706
02:49:31,050 --> 02:49:33,720
It's like the actual reaction that
people have.

3707
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:37,020
They want to think that the other person
was being a dick,

3708
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:41,160
but maybe you were being something
negative too,

3709
02:49:41,161 --> 02:49:43,350
and they're reacted to that.
Then it compounded.

3710
02:49:43,351 --> 02:49:47,490
But maybe as Scott Adams was talking to
the guy and use the exact same words,

3711
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:50,310
none of the disagreement would have
taken place in the first place.

3712
02:49:50,570 --> 02:49:52,160
The messenger is always,
you know,

3713
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:53,340
the message.
Well,

3714
02:49:53,341 --> 02:49:54,660
we're both,
we're,

3715
02:49:54,690 --> 02:49:59,010
we are more than one thing and when
human beings are interacting with each

3716
02:49:59,011 --> 02:50:00,180
other,
we're,

3717
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:03,360
we're doing,
it's almost like we're putting on a

3718
02:50:03,361 --> 02:50:04,860
combined effort.

3719
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:05,911
We're,
and we're,

3720
02:50:05,911 --> 02:50:10,740
we're piecing together a conversation
and this conversation is a joint effort.

3721
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:14,850
It's like we're both contributing to it
and it might come out terrible.

3722
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:16,530
Um,
but it might not be your fault.

3723
02:50:16,531 --> 02:50:19,200
It might be 100 percent my fault or it
might be 100 percent your fault.

3724
02:50:19,360 --> 02:50:21,930
Like,
but the way it comes out is because the

3725
02:50:21,931 --> 02:50:24,290
two of us together didn't sync up,
you know,

3726
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:26,820
and oftentimes they say,
I met Scott Adams.

3727
02:50:26,821 --> 02:50:29,490
He's a fucking piece of shit,
but it's not really you.

3728
02:50:29,491 --> 02:50:31,530
It might just be the way I hear that a
lot.

3729
02:50:31,580 --> 02:50:34,870
How dare you.
But it might be the way this person talk

3730
02:50:34,871 --> 02:50:36,960
to you.
Like they might've started out right off

3731
02:50:36,961 --> 02:50:39,840
the bat trying to joke around and,
and you know,

3732
02:50:39,841 --> 02:50:43,890
said something rude or said something
they thought was funny and you didn't or

3733
02:50:43,891 --> 02:50:45,600
caught you at a bad time or,
you know.

3734
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:50,430
Yeah.
I just try to be aware that I'm causing

3735
02:50:50,431 --> 02:50:54,590
people to be the way they are more often
than you imagine why.

3736
02:50:54,610 --> 02:50:57,300
I also got to think that being the
president has got to be.

3737
02:50:57,570 --> 02:50:59,850
I mean,
you want to look at yourself the way the

3738
02:50:59,851 --> 02:51:04,620
world looks at you,
the harshness of the view of the people

3739
02:51:04,621 --> 02:51:07,740
on the outside looking in.
There's no better way than to be the

3740
02:51:07,741 --> 02:51:08,910
president.
I mean,

3741
02:51:09,060 --> 02:51:13,410
he's got people walking down,
wilshire blocking traffic,

3742
02:51:13,411 --> 02:51:15,720
screaming.
They fucking hate him like that.

3743
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:18,360
If anything is going to cause you a
narcissist,

3744
02:51:18,450 --> 02:51:21,930
clearly obviously he's the guy has a
great love for himself,

3745
02:51:21,931 --> 02:51:24,780
which is part of his success.
Part of why puts his name on the

3746
02:51:24,781 --> 02:51:29,781
buildings is a great love for himself.
That takes a hit when you see thousands

3747
02:51:30,361 --> 02:51:32,110
of americans,
hundreds of thousands,

3748
02:51:32,111 --> 02:51:35,490
in fact wandering down the street with
signs saying they hate you.

3749
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:37,570
I don't know.
You don't think so?

3750
02:51:37,610 --> 02:51:42,610
I'm not sure it does because you
probably have your critics as well and

3751
02:51:42,690 --> 02:51:47,190
they're not blocking traffic.
Imagine if the fucking people that hated

3752
02:51:47,191 --> 02:51:49,830
you were blocking traffic.
Fuck dilbert,

3753
02:51:49,831 --> 02:51:54,831
and they just had this gigantic stream
of people would chance donald champ,

3754
02:51:55,370 --> 02:51:55,960
k,
k,

3755
02:51:55,960 --> 02:51:58,460
k,
k,

3756
02:51:58,520 --> 02:52:00,330
and the screaming and you know that this
things a true.

3757
02:52:00,390 --> 02:52:04,210
I just imagined myself in the oval
office looking out the window.

3758
02:52:04,211 --> 02:52:06,640
I'm the president and they see the
protesters

3759
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:09,100
and I'm thinking,
I'm not having a bad day.

3760
02:52:09,810 --> 02:52:14,110
I'm the president of the United States.
So I think it gets lost in the noise

3761
02:52:14,111 --> 02:52:17,930
after you get elected.
I mean if civilization breaks that

3762
02:52:18,300 --> 02:52:21,610
you're talking about a guy that if
Someone tweets something negative about

3763
02:52:21,611 --> 02:52:22,780
it,
he's got a tweet back.

3764
02:52:22,781 --> 02:52:24,790
You're talking about A guy.
If somebody writes an article about him

3765
02:52:24,791 --> 02:52:26,980
in the wall street journal,
he'll go on his twitter page and call

3766
02:52:26,981 --> 02:52:29,020
that magazine or that newspaper a piece
of shit.

3767
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:32,170
The failed New York times still won't
stop lying about me.

3768
02:52:32,350 --> 02:52:35,590
He's not a guy who was immune to the
impact of criticism against him.

3769
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:39,550
So if that criticism is coming in the
form of hundreds of thousands of people

3770
02:52:39,551 --> 02:52:43,450
protesting the idea that he's going to
suddenly become enlightened enough to

3771
02:52:43,451 --> 02:52:44,710
ignore that.
Totally,

3772
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:46,750
but don't.
I don't miss the pattern.

3773
02:52:46,870 --> 02:52:48,790
He,
he attacks professionals,

3774
02:52:49,410 --> 02:52:51,820
so he,
he goes after people who were in the

3775
02:52:51,821 --> 02:52:52,654
cage.

3776
02:52:52,710 --> 02:52:55,390
If you're not in the cage,
you're cool.

3777
02:52:56,050 --> 02:52:59,860
so those people on the street that are
just screaming and what is he said about

3778
02:52:59,861 --> 02:53:02,800
the protesters?
I think what he said is kind of

3779
02:53:02,801 --> 02:53:06,400
interesting because I think what he did
say is that it's great that they have

3780
02:53:06,401 --> 02:53:09,700
these rights to protests and he likes
the fact that they're all getting

3781
02:53:09,701 --> 02:53:12,070
together and voice their opinion,
but we're all going to work this out

3782
02:53:12,071 --> 02:53:13,650
together and he likes her energy or
something.

3783
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:14,740
Yeah,
something like that.

3784
02:53:14,741 --> 02:53:15,590
So,
so that's,

3785
02:53:15,640 --> 02:53:17,440
that's my point.
Yeah.

3786
02:53:17,650 --> 02:53:18,760
If any of the,
if the,

3787
02:53:18,761 --> 02:53:21,330
if the parade had been led by,
you know,

3788
02:53:21,340 --> 02:53:24,790
a reporter for the New York times,
he would have eviscerated the

3789
02:53:24,791 --> 02:53:28,150
professional and he wouldn't have
touched anybody behind him because

3790
02:53:28,151 --> 02:53:29,650
they're there.
The citizens.

3791
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:31,300
No,
that's a good point.

3792
02:53:31,990 --> 02:53:32,540
It,
you,

3793
02:53:32,540 --> 02:53:37,270
you make a very convincing argument for
this all being a positive event.

3794
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:40,850
And I think one of the best arguments
for it being a positive event.

3795
02:53:40,870 --> 02:53:44,470
This is the first time ever,
we've had someone who has no,

3796
02:53:44,570 --> 02:53:49,480
no political background or aspirations
and they're already famous and

3797
02:53:49,481 --> 02:53:51,340
successful and they become the
president,

3798
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:55,000
so we're going to get to see,
and it was a guy who wants to dismantle

3799
02:53:55,001 --> 02:53:56,590
a system,
like one of the things he said about

3800
02:53:56,591 --> 02:53:58,030
passing bills.
See,

3801
02:53:58,180 --> 02:54:00,310
when you pass a new bill,
you got to get rid of two old ones.

3802
02:54:00,990 --> 02:54:01,823
And I was like,
well,

3803
02:54:01,980 --> 02:54:03,160
regulations,
regulation,

3804
02:54:03,161 --> 02:54:05,920
excuse me by my first reaction to that
was,

3805
02:54:05,921 --> 02:54:08,350
oh,
that is a stupid oversimplification,

3806
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:12,800
but I'll bet there are enough old laws
that they want to get rid of any way

3807
02:54:13,190 --> 02:54:16,180
that for a long time you could get rid
of two for one.

3808
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:18,250
Yeah,
there might be some ridiculous ones that

3809
02:54:18,251 --> 02:54:19,320
we could get rid of it.

3810
02:54:19,480 --> 02:54:22,510
It's entirely possible you can't do that
rule forever.

3811
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:26,270
And of course dr.
Deregulation,

3812
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:28,490
um,
when it comes to environmental efforts

3813
02:54:28,491 --> 02:54:30,670
is one thing that terrifies people.
And this,

3814
02:54:30,710 --> 02:54:33,700
um,
climate denier a concern.

3815
02:54:33,701 --> 02:54:35,950
That's a real issue.
That's something that could affect us.

3816
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,510
Let's talk about that.
Sure.

3817
02:54:37,511 --> 02:54:39,820
Please.
Because people have been begging me

3818
02:54:39,910 --> 02:54:44,860
please to give any argument that doesn't
make Donald Trump look like a science

3819
02:54:44,890 --> 02:54:46,960
retarded.
I'm soRry I shouldn't use that word.

3820
02:54:46,990 --> 02:54:50,050
I apollo use it.
It doesn't have any bearing on science.

3821
02:54:50,230 --> 02:54:54,520
It's not a medical term.
Retard is people that are retarded with

3822
02:54:54,521 --> 02:54:56,770
their.
They're slow to catch on.

3823
02:54:57,010 --> 02:54:58,600
And we're not talking aBout mental
illness.

3824
02:54:58,601 --> 02:55:00,850
We're talking about retards.
Alright?

3825
02:55:01,470 --> 02:55:04,000
But I apologize if anybody was offended
or you're going to do that.

3826
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:05,700
They don't let you do it.
Um,

3827
02:55:07,010 --> 02:55:09,740
so here's,
here's my best argument.

3828
02:55:09,890 --> 02:55:13,490
Let's say I'll just play lawyer for a
second and I'm going to defend donald

3829
02:55:13,491 --> 02:55:18,491
trump's climate change position,
which disagrees with all of science was.

3830
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:21,740
So you're starting from a deep hole,
right?

3831
02:55:21,770 --> 02:55:25,940
So you acknowledged that they've got a
tough task year to what's state his

3832
02:55:25,941 --> 02:55:30,230
opinion for what is his position first?
His opinion is that we don't need to

3833
02:55:30,231 --> 02:55:35,231
actively work on climate change.
Rather he would rather work actively on

3834
02:55:36,201 --> 02:55:41,000
cleaning the air and the water and I
think he thinks that gets us to the same

3835
02:55:41,001 --> 02:55:42,430
place.
Um,

3836
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:44,790
and it might,
uh,

3837
02:55:45,050 --> 02:55:46,550
here's my argument.
I believe,

3838
02:55:46,551 --> 02:55:48,650
and again,
I'm going to speculate a little bit here

3839
02:55:48,680 --> 02:55:50,990
so I don't want to put too many words
into the president's mouth,

3840
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:55,070
but I think that he's separating the
data collection part of the science,

3841
02:55:55,071 --> 02:55:59,030
which is you measure things and sure
enough temperatures seems to be changing

3842
02:55:59,031 --> 02:56:02,660
and historically significant ways and
sure enough,

3843
02:56:02,661 --> 02:56:05,510
humans seem to be behind some part of
that change.

3844
02:56:06,050 --> 02:56:11,050
I think trump accepts that part of it.
The second part of it is not the data

3845
02:56:11,361 --> 02:56:15,530
collection is the complicated models
that predict what happens with all this

3846
02:56:15,531 --> 02:56:19,070
data.
I think the trump things that those

3847
02:56:19,071 --> 02:56:21,950
models are unreliable and not credible
and probably bullshit,

3848
02:56:22,370 --> 02:56:26,540
just like he thought the polls were
inaccurate,

3849
02:56:27,070 --> 02:56:30,800
right?
Remember you just watched him defy every

3850
02:56:30,801 --> 02:56:33,380
expert in the world.
One hundred percent of pollsters said,

3851
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:34,460
no,
Donald Trump.

3852
02:56:34,490 --> 02:56:37,070
Look at our numbers.
This could not be more clear.

3853
02:56:37,071 --> 02:56:40,670
It's independent people.
These are legitimate professionals.

3854
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:44,450
There's no freaking way that you win
with these numbers,

3855
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:47,390
and Donald Trump said,
I don't believe the polls,

3856
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:49,920
and it was right.
Donald trump was right,

3857
02:56:50,020 --> 02:56:53,720
but there's a big difference between
poles and scientific measurements of our

3858
02:56:53,721 --> 02:56:54,770
carbon footprint.
No,

3859
02:56:54,810 --> 02:56:57,860
I'm not saying that the same thing,
so I'm not gonna I'm not going to leap

3860
02:56:57,861 --> 02:56:59,340
and say case closed based on it.

3861
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:01,430
I'm just going to say that through our
history.

3862
02:57:01,431 --> 02:57:05,300
If you try to find the context,
how many times have we built a

3863
02:57:05,301 --> 02:57:09,230
complicated model on that scale and got
it right?

3864
02:57:09,630 --> 02:57:12,110
All right,
so there's nobody who's doing a good job

3865
02:57:12,111 --> 02:57:15,080
of predicting where the economy will be
next year.

3866
02:57:15,081 --> 02:57:18,380
Those are very similar in the sense that
there's lots of variables and different

3867
02:57:18,381 --> 02:57:19,910
models and stuff,
um,

3868
02:57:20,350 --> 02:57:22,070
that,
that turns out to be just random.

3869
02:57:22,820 --> 02:57:26,180
If the economy's largely based on
confidence,

3870
02:57:26,181 --> 02:57:28,160
it's,
there's a bunch of factors involved in

3871
02:57:28,161 --> 02:57:30,800
the economy.
How much is involved in the atmosphere.

3872
02:57:30,890 --> 02:57:32,510
I mean,
if you can,

3873
02:57:32,511 --> 02:57:36,890
their models figuring out that there was
a volcano over here,

3874
02:57:36,891 --> 02:57:39,920
there's something happened in the ocean
that you didn't expect.

3875
02:57:39,921 --> 02:57:42,120
Some,
some seaweed,

3876
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:44,840
hobo.
Do you don't think they have accounted

3877
02:57:44,841 --> 02:57:48,650
for that when they're talking about the
models of the earth being warmer every

3878
02:57:48,650 --> 02:57:51,470
year?
I the past decade and scientists being

3879
02:57:51,860 --> 02:57:54,260
incredibly concerned that have been
studying this their whole lives,

3880
02:57:54,470 --> 02:57:58,190
seeing unprecedented levels of change.
You don't think that that's.

3881
02:57:58,280 --> 02:58:00,860
I think that.
Here's where the analogy to the,

3882
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:01,980
the polling

3883
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:04,680
is similar.
We all thought the pilot polling was

3884
02:58:04,681 --> 02:58:07,920
reliable because it's sort of math and
you know,

3885
02:58:07,940 --> 02:58:11,430
the science seems to work.
What you realized later is that there

3886
02:58:11,431 --> 02:58:15,180
was a whole bunch of judgment that went
into which variable to include and you

3887
02:58:15,181 --> 02:58:15,860
know,
who,

3888
02:58:15,860 --> 02:58:18,060
um,
assumptions about who's going to show up

3889
02:58:18,061 --> 02:58:21,570
on polling day and nobody could have any
good idea what was going to happen.

3890
02:58:22,050 --> 02:58:26,170
So the most important part of the models
was literally just people sit in the

3891
02:58:26,171 --> 02:58:27,090
room say,
I don't know.

3892
02:58:27,091 --> 02:58:30,540
I think it would be like last time these
case with science though,

3893
02:58:30,541 --> 02:58:32,970
and climate change.
That doesn't make sense to me.

3894
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:36,030
I think that it seems likely,
and again,

3895
02:58:36,031 --> 02:58:39,180
this would be subject to smarter people
correcting me and I,

3896
02:58:39,181 --> 02:58:41,730
I could easily be corrected on this.
Um,

3897
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:44,490
I think that when you have big
complicated models and lots of people

3898
02:58:44,491 --> 02:58:47,460
working on it,
there are probably places in which

3899
02:58:47,461 --> 02:58:48,660
people are using judgment.

3900
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:50,580
For example,
in this just be a,

3901
02:58:50,730 --> 02:58:51,930
you know,
just to make the point,

3902
02:58:52,290 --> 02:58:55,680
there may be two sets of data and you
could say,

3903
02:58:55,681 --> 02:58:58,920
well this one seems more reliable than
that one because of whatever.

3904
02:58:59,400 --> 02:59:02,550
So I would think they're probably
different scientists could get wildly

3905
02:59:02,551 --> 02:59:07,200
different projections and all of them
tapping the same source of data just

3906
02:59:07,201 --> 02:59:10,440
like the pollsters got the wrong
answers,

3907
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:12,120
but they're all looking at the same
data.

3908
02:59:12,570 --> 02:59:16,590
I see what you're saying kind of.
But I really don't see the connection

3909
02:59:16,591 --> 02:59:19,500
between that and the polls because
everybody knows the polls is based on a

3910
02:59:19,501 --> 02:59:23,430
very small group of people.
Whereas the vast majority of the problem

3911
02:59:23,460 --> 02:59:28,460
of the population is largely uncounted.
Like we really weren't.

3912
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:31,020
We were guessing and gauging but their
opinion.

3913
02:59:31,050 --> 02:59:35,400
But that wasn't the problem because
polling is scientific enough that it can

3914
02:59:35,401 --> 02:59:36,510
capture it in some way.

3915
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:37,980
But they're,
the conceit is,

3916
02:59:37,981 --> 02:59:40,680
I mean you,
you have to admit that there's a certain

3917
02:59:40,681 --> 02:59:43,830
percentage that we absolutely know.
We're not measuring those people when

3918
02:59:43,831 --> 02:59:45,750
you're talking about the temperature of
the earth.

3919
02:59:46,130 --> 02:59:50,490
He or you're absolutely measuring.
So we're measuring the climate all over

3920
02:59:50,491 --> 02:59:52,290
the globe.
You're actually measuring,

3921
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:56,130
measuring the sheer heart numbers.
There's no opinion based on there's no

3922
02:59:56,131 --> 02:59:59,910
fluctuation of opinion.
I'm agreeing with you that the data

3923
02:59:59,911 --> 03:00:03,890
collection is probably pretty solid
because there's an extra.

3924
03:00:03,900 --> 03:00:06,690
The interpretation of the data is what
you're disagreeing with.

3925
03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:09,270
By the time you put it into an economic
model,

3926
03:00:09,330 --> 03:00:13,640
there's almost certainly some fuckery,
a judgment call that somebody who

3927
03:00:13,641 --> 03:00:18,210
doesn't think as a judgment call that's
almost guaranteed to be part of the

3928
03:00:18,211 --> 03:00:20,220
model building procedure.
Now,

3929
03:00:20,221 --> 03:00:23,250
I would love for somebody to educate me
on this because I've never talked to

3930
03:00:23,251 --> 03:00:26,280
somebody whose job it is to build a
climate model.

3931
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:28,020
Like,
I'd love to sit in a room and say,

3932
03:00:28,230 --> 03:00:33,230
is there any part of this where two
people who are both experts could have

3933
03:00:33,241 --> 03:00:37,320
picked a different variable and I'm
almost certain that's the case because

3934
03:00:37,321 --> 03:00:40,290
it's a lot of variables in this
complicated and so he's going to be the

3935
03:00:40,291 --> 03:00:41,011
case,
right?

3936
03:00:41,011 --> 03:00:43,890
But when you have a mass consensus,
when it comes to scientists,

3937
03:00:43,891 --> 03:00:47,310
you're not talking about politicians,
you're not talking about cnn versus fox

3938
03:00:47,311 --> 03:00:48,960
news,
you're talking about scientists,

3939
03:00:48,961 --> 03:00:51,270
right?
When you have a vast consensus that

3940
03:00:51,271 --> 03:00:55,410
believe that we have a real issue with
our carbon footprint and that we really

3941
03:00:55,411 --> 03:00:59,500
need to slow down the amount of
pollutants and the particulates we put

3942
03:00:59,501 --> 03:01:00,334
into the air.

3943
03:01:00,490 --> 03:01:03,790
So is that a word?
Particulants particles.

3944
03:01:04,090 --> 03:01:07,330
What's the word?
What's the word with like the thing that

3945
03:01:07,331 --> 03:01:10,510
people worry about a lot of is not just
the,

3946
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:13,540
like the carbon in the air,
but also the fucking dirt,

3947
03:01:13,780 --> 03:01:14,770
the dust,
the,

3948
03:01:14,771 --> 03:01:17,350
the,
the actual pollution being.

3949
03:01:17,370 --> 03:01:19,450
So.
So here's the third leg of my,

3950
03:01:19,451 --> 03:01:20,530
uh,
particulates.

3951
03:01:20,531 --> 03:01:21,100
Yeah,
it was right.

3952
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:21,911
Okay.
Thank you.

3953
03:01:21,911 --> 03:01:24,950
I love my defense.
So trump's thing is clean the water,

3954
03:01:24,970 --> 03:01:26,290
clean the air,
good move,

3955
03:01:26,350 --> 03:01:29,710
but it seems like that's going to get
you to the same place right now.

3956
03:01:29,711 --> 03:01:32,110
Let me give you another,
maybe give you another really hot.

3957
03:01:32,111 --> 03:01:33,820
No,
let me give you another analogy.

3958
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:37,300
Um,
I put solar panels on my house when I

3959
03:01:37,301 --> 03:01:40,110
built it nine years ago.
Um,

3960
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:43,990
what those solar panels have saved me
enough electricity and I can predict

3961
03:01:43,991 --> 03:01:47,560
forward that I'll definitely get my
money back from putting on solar panels.

3962
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:51,610
Question.
Was it a good economic idea to put those

3963
03:01:51,611 --> 03:01:53,710
solar panels on?
Knowing what you know,

3964
03:01:54,130 --> 03:01:58,690
that the cost will more than be made up
in my savings.

3965
03:01:58,691 --> 03:02:01,900
Was that a good idea for me to do?
It seems like it wrong.

3966
03:02:01,930 --> 03:02:04,050
It was a terrible,
terrible idea wrong.

3967
03:02:04,090 --> 03:02:06,640
And I knew it at the time.
But by the way,

3968
03:02:06,641 --> 03:02:08,560
I have a background in economics.
That's my,

3969
03:02:08,590 --> 03:02:12,460
my degree mba from berkeley.
So why is it terrible idea?

3970
03:02:12,730 --> 03:02:15,970
Because I knew,
and this is what happened to the cost of

3971
03:02:15,971 --> 03:02:18,340
solar cells,
dropped so quickly,

3972
03:02:18,610 --> 03:02:21,730
that if I had simply waited three years
and bought it,

3973
03:02:21,731 --> 03:02:24,640
then I would have only you know,
three years of savings,

3974
03:02:25,060 --> 03:02:29,260
but I would have gotten it as such as a
lower price that I would pay it back

3975
03:02:29,261 --> 03:02:33,910
much faster and then it'd be gravy from
there on if you only wanted to look at

3976
03:02:33,911 --> 03:02:35,800
it that way,
but if you didn't take into

3977
03:02:35,801 --> 03:02:40,060
consideration the variable of you
affecting the carbon footprint of the

3978
03:02:40,061 --> 03:02:43,900
earth by gathering up your electricity
for three years due to convention.

3979
03:02:44,260 --> 03:02:48,520
That's actually why I did it and so I
made made a bad economic decision

3980
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:51,520
because the,
what we call these stupid rich have to

3981
03:02:51,521 --> 03:02:52,280
go first.
Okay.

3982
03:02:52,280 --> 03:02:55,090
But it wasn't a terrible idea.
It just wasn't a good idea.

3983
03:02:55,120 --> 03:02:56,980
Economically.
It was a very good idea.

3984
03:02:56,981 --> 03:02:59,910
It wasn't a good idea economically,
the economically.

3985
03:02:59,911 --> 03:03:02,050
Okay.
So I'm sure you can't consider all sorts

3986
03:03:02,051 --> 03:03:03,080
of other variables.
All right,

3987
03:03:03,100 --> 03:03:05,770
well all,
all analogies breakdown ultimately.

3988
03:03:05,771 --> 03:03:07,750
So I tell you,
but they're good for.

3989
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:09,750
They're good for explaining.
Okay.

3990
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:12,190
If they're not good for proving a point
to say that.

3991
03:03:12,790 --> 03:03:16,800
So here's the analogy.
Odds are that technology is going to

3992
03:03:16,810 --> 03:03:19,690
save us from climate change.
Really?

3993
03:03:19,691 --> 03:03:21,030
Yeah.
They're there already,

3994
03:03:21,031 --> 03:03:22,350
um,
you know,

3995
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:26,050
on the drawing board,
ideas for putting like a giant hose into

3996
03:03:26,051 --> 03:03:31,051
the upper atmosphere and in somehow
sucking bad things that will suck all

3997
03:03:31,151 --> 03:03:34,270
the clouds out to
but yet.

3998
03:03:34,450 --> 03:03:36,910
But chances are,
chances are,

3999
03:03:36,990 --> 03:03:38,740
and again,
you might not want to take this risk.

4000
03:03:38,741 --> 03:03:42,370
I'm not even saying you should,
but she has this are if you waited five

4001
03:03:42,371 --> 03:03:45,100
or 10 years and then got serious about
it,

4002
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:48,580
you'd probably be in a better position
because we'd have better technology.

4003
03:03:48,581 --> 03:03:50,680
And,
and starting from that point,

4004
03:03:50,681 --> 03:03:54,130
we just be in a better place or no,
I'm not saying we should do that.

4005
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:57,980
I'm just saying that you can't know this
starting now is the

4006
03:03:57,980 --> 03:04:00,560
smart thing because like my solar
panels,

4007
03:04:00,890 --> 03:04:04,910
the technology's changing so fast,
that waiting a little bit until you

4008
03:04:04,911 --> 03:04:08,840
really can get some purchase with some
good technology and just go balls to the

4009
03:04:08,841 --> 03:04:10,350
wall and say,
all right,

4010
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:13,670
fucking $500,000,000,000.
We're going to spend now because we've

4011
03:04:13,671 --> 03:04:16,340
got the solution,
maybe this is a convenient way that

4012
03:04:16,341 --> 03:04:19,880
you're interfacing with the software
simulation that we're all trapped in

4013
03:04:20,630 --> 03:04:25,630
your choosing to take this path of a
success based on technological

4014
03:04:26,211 --> 03:04:30,830
progression rather than based on taking
care of mother earth.

4015
03:04:30,890 --> 03:04:32,790
Well,
it doesn't.

4016
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:37,580
Doesn't every model assume that
everything stays the same and there's

4017
03:04:37,581 --> 03:04:38,570
just more of it.
Right?

4018
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:43,220
So here's one thing I can guarantee your
climate change model does not include,

4019
03:04:43,320 --> 03:04:46,220
okay fucking hose to the upper
atmosphere.

4020
03:04:47,060 --> 03:04:50,240
I never thought about until you brought
it up and isn't that going to be the

4021
03:04:50,241 --> 03:04:53,330
biggest factor?
It will be the technological change that

4022
03:04:53,331 --> 03:04:56,630
happens between now and that in fact,
that's the whole point of alarming us.

4023
03:04:56,840 --> 03:04:59,630
So we'll work hard on the technological
changes.

4024
03:04:59,690 --> 03:05:02,600
I thought they should make a skyscraper
sized air filter.

4025
03:05:03,900 --> 03:05:07,540
That's one of the plans there.
There is a,

4026
03:05:07,580 --> 03:05:10,220
something like that.
Then they could actually take that

4027
03:05:10,221 --> 03:05:12,140
carbon out of the atmosphere and use it
for fuel.

4028
03:05:12,210 --> 03:05:13,440
Right?
And Burn it,

4029
03:05:13,500 --> 03:05:14,370
burn it back.
I,

4030
03:05:14,430 --> 03:05:18,020
I've seen some amazing things in
headlines recently,

4031
03:05:18,021 --> 03:05:21,770
but I never trust any of them and it
totally makes sense that if we can clean

4032
03:05:21,771 --> 03:05:24,260
air in your house,
like you know we have that right behind

4033
03:05:24,261 --> 03:05:26,060
you right there for when people smoke
cigarettes,

4034
03:05:26,061 --> 03:05:28,260
we have that air filter and it's pretty
powerful.

4035
03:05:28,261 --> 03:05:32,360
If someone can sit in your seat and
smoke a cigarette and this room will be

4036
03:05:32,361 --> 03:05:34,790
bearable.
Well yeah you can.

4037
03:05:34,840 --> 03:05:38,450
You can do that.
And that's a very simple portable unit.

4038
03:05:38,690 --> 03:05:41,090
Some buildings have very sophisticated
units,

4039
03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:45,020
so I think the technology for scrubbing
the atmosphere already exists.

4040
03:05:45,020 --> 03:05:48,950
It's just not implementing it on a large
scale is not economical.

4041
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:53,030
So just like my soldier pedals.
So the point is if you started now and

4042
03:05:53,031 --> 03:05:56,710
spend $500,000,000,000,
you might get a billion dollars with a

4043
03:05:56,900 --> 03:05:59,660
benefit because you don't have the right
technology.

4044
03:06:00,020 --> 03:06:03,200
If you waited,
they had the right technology and then

4045
03:06:03,201 --> 03:06:05,810
put your effort into it,
you might get it for cheap.

4046
03:06:06,260 --> 03:06:07,670
Okay.
We don't know that.

4047
03:06:07,700 --> 03:06:09,590
So that that's a risk.
That's a risk.

4048
03:06:09,591 --> 03:06:14,591
Everybody is got to assess that a is
much more comfortable than the idea of a

4049
03:06:16,071 --> 03:06:21,071
climate change denier perspective.
Like a climate change optimist,

4050
03:06:21,410 --> 03:06:21,921
like,
yeah,

4051
03:06:21,921 --> 03:06:25,190
I know it's kind of fucked up now,
but we've got some stuff in the works.

4052
03:06:25,280 --> 03:06:27,050
Don't worry folks.
We looked at the progressions that are

4053
03:06:27,051 --> 03:06:31,550
going to be fine.
Well I think trump is trying to have it

4054
03:06:31,551 --> 03:06:32,450
both ways.
You know,

4055
03:06:32,451 --> 03:06:34,370
he's got people he needs to satisfying
the right,

4056
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:36,200
but he doesn't want to be a crazy man
and left.

4057
03:06:36,600 --> 03:06:40,760
so we've had testified in some story
that both people can find some comfort

4058
03:06:40,761 --> 03:06:45,320
in because this is such a big issue and
I think that middle ground is where he's

4059
03:06:45,321 --> 03:06:47,960
trying.
He's sort of ab testing it now by saying

4060
03:06:48,290 --> 03:06:49,900
let's clean the air,
you know,

4061
03:06:50,420 --> 03:06:53,060
clean the water because how do you do
that?

4062
03:06:53,480 --> 03:06:54,261
You can't,
you know,

4063
03:06:54,261 --> 03:06:55,580
you do all the same.
Don't you know,

4064
03:06:55,590 --> 03:06:57,390
but you really can't do that yet.
No,

4065
03:06:57,410 --> 03:06:59,190
I clean all the water and clean all the
air.

4066
03:06:59,360 --> 03:07:01,440
I mean you would have to woof.
Oh well,

4067
03:07:01,441 --> 03:07:03,930
but the technology is to get there,
right.

4068
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:06,600
Are going to be at Least overlapping
with whatever you need to do with

4069
03:07:06,601 --> 03:07:07,680
climate change,
hopefully,

4070
03:07:07,890 --> 03:07:10,230
because you still want your electric car
either way.

4071
03:07:11,010 --> 03:07:13,470
It's just different way to get there.
You also gotta think that whatever

4072
03:07:13,471 --> 03:07:16,530
byproducts that are in the atmosphere
and in the water,

4073
03:07:16,860 --> 03:07:19,020
all that stuff could probably be used
for something.

4074
03:07:19,070 --> 03:07:19,730
I mean the,
the,

4075
03:07:19,730 --> 03:07:21,240
the whatever these.
Yeah.

4076
03:07:21,360 --> 03:07:23,700
I think.
I think there's already,

4077
03:07:23,910 --> 03:07:26,220
at least in the lab they've,
they've made it useful.

4078
03:07:26,430 --> 03:07:30,740
That will be really fascinating if we
figured out a way someday to get to a

4079
03:07:30,750 --> 03:07:33,210
zero emission state,
you know,

4080
03:07:33,211 --> 03:07:37,890
where everything we use gets recycled
and we keep the air pure and we just

4081
03:07:37,891 --> 03:07:42,660
figured out a way to be completely
efficient and how we burn things or how

4082
03:07:42,661 --> 03:07:46,290
we make things or how we recycle things
and that we all leave.

4083
03:07:46,880 --> 03:07:48,230
I mean it just seems like.
Well,

4084
03:07:48,270 --> 03:07:51,960
I think what you're saying economically,
once it becomes economically feasible,

4085
03:07:52,040 --> 03:07:57,040
there's becomes like this big financial
boom and taking whatever the particular

4086
03:07:57,781 --> 03:07:58,560
incident,
the,

4087
03:07:58,560 --> 03:08:02,170
the carbon or whatever it is,
out of the atmosphere and you make mass

4088
03:08:02,171 --> 03:08:04,140
amounts of money from doing that.
You know,

4089
03:08:04,220 --> 03:08:07,020
and people figure out a way to get
really rich doing it.

4090
03:08:07,110 --> 03:08:08,730
Yeah.
Somebody just got to figure out a way to

4091
03:08:08,731 --> 03:08:11,560
get rich.
Every solution has that.

4092
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:14,460
Right.
And then somebody found out a way to get

4093
03:08:14,461 --> 03:08:14,911
rich.
Okay.

4094
03:08:14,911 --> 03:08:17,280
Problem solved.
Is this one of the first podcasts you've

4095
03:08:17,281 --> 03:08:19,120
done like this?
Um,

4096
03:08:19,140 --> 03:08:22,560
I've done other podcasts but sort of
prepared yourself for something like

4097
03:08:22,561 --> 03:08:25,050
this by doing periscopes.
Like you're really good at these like

4098
03:08:25,080 --> 03:08:27,180
long form things.
Have you ever thought about doing your

4099
03:08:27,181 --> 03:08:29,670
own podcast?
I have actually.

4100
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:32,460
I'm curious about it.
Just tell people gonna be mad at me

4101
03:08:32,461 --> 03:08:34,350
right now.
They get fucking mad every time I tell

4102
03:08:34,351 --> 03:08:36,510
somebody to do a podcast because I'm
like,

4103
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:37,680
dude,
everybody shouldn't do a vlog,

4104
03:08:37,681 --> 03:08:40,560
a blog post,
but I think you should do a podcast.

4105
03:08:40,650 --> 03:08:42,990
I really do.
I would be remiss if I did not bring it

4106
03:08:42,991 --> 03:08:44,580
up.
People have been asking me.

4107
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:48,540
I can't tell you how many people just
begged me to come onto your show.

4108
03:08:48,630 --> 03:08:51,840
Really?
It's the single most requested thing of

4109
03:08:51,841 --> 03:08:52,890
my year.
Wow.

4110
03:08:53,190 --> 03:08:54,930
Holy shit.
You specifically.

4111
03:08:55,020 --> 03:08:56,150
Wow.
Well,

4112
03:08:56,151 --> 03:08:58,500
it was worth it for me.
I enjoyed it.

4113
03:08:58,610 --> 03:09:00,030
I enjoy.
I had a great time.

4114
03:09:00,260 --> 03:09:02,040
We do this again.
This is a peak experience.

4115
03:09:02,070 --> 03:09:04,050
Let's do it again.
I would definitely do it once a year.

4116
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:05,570
Let's come.
Come back in here and we'll see how this

4117
03:09:05,580 --> 03:09:07,530
fucking crazy plans working out.
I'll do that.

4118
03:09:07,590 --> 03:09:08,460
Let's do it.
Sure.

4119
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:09,780
Thank you scott.
I really appreciate it,

4120

4121
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:15,330

4122

Just go to [inaudible] dot com.
[inaudible] dot com.

4123
03:09:17,630 --> 03:09:20,070
My book,
how to fail at almost everything.

4124
03:09:20,071 --> 03:09:25,071
Still win big and look at my app when
