1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,170
Oh righty Jane,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
what's happening?

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,360
I'm here.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:06,961
You are here.

5
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:07,411
You made it.

6
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:08,244
And I'm excited too.

7
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:08,911
Thanks for doing this.

8
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:09,744
Appreciate it.

9
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,880
So your story is a very fascinating story.

10
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,220
You got a brain injury and you decided
to make a game to help your brain

11
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,484
recover.

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,271
Now,

13
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,690
what led you to even
attempt something like that?

14
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,460
I've never heard of anything
like that in the past.

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,021
Well,

16
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:32,000
I had been designing games professionally
and researching them for 10 years.

17
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,200
By the time I hit my head and
it was not my first instinct.

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,531
Oh,

19
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,490
I have a brain injury.

20
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,450
Let me make a game.

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,410
But you know,

22
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:41,120
about a month into the recovery,

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,710
I wasn't getting any better.

24
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,350
I was really depressed and anxious.

25
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,730
Uh,

26
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,910
I mean I was,

27
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:49,040
it was like the lowest point of my life.

28
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,930
And I knew from my research
that when we play games,

29
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,350
you know,

30
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,210
we have more optimism,

31
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:57,620
we're more determined.

32
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,570
We're better able to ask people for help,

33
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,860
right to team up with us,

34
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:01,694
be your allies.

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,960
And I just figured,

36
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,010
well,

37
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,843
uh,

38
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,130
this is like the worst
I've ever felt in my life.

39
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:10,340
Maybe if I can bring some of that
game full spirit to recovery,

40
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,760
I could kind of jump start
my brain back into healing.

41
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,100
So what was the nature of your injury?

42
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,010
Uh,

43
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,501
I mean it was,

44
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,360
it started out as just
a normal concussion.

45
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,343
And,

46
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,040
uh,

47
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,050
so this is my public service announcement,

48
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,490
right?

49
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,323
Of the episode.

50
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,900
I was standing up from underneath
and open cabinet and I'm a runner,

51
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:33,700
so I've really strong legs and I was just
in a hurry and I've just full us right

52
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,080
up into the corner of the cabinet,

53
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:35,770
um,

54
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,371
hit my head.

55
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,360
And it was like classic,

56
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:37,811
you know,

57
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,160
my husband was joking around,

58
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,370
you know,

59
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,240
who's the president?

60
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,820
And I couldn't remember who the
president was and I was like,

61
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,713
Oh shit,

62
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,680
that really bad.

63
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,050
All I could get hit in the head.

64
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:46,884
You couldn't remember.

65
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,270
This is Barack Obama.

66
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,001
It was,

67
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,260
and all I could remember was,

68
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,910
it's not George Bush anymore,

69
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,070
but I couldn't remember who it was.

70
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,001
Wow.

71
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,150
So just standing up and hitting
the edge of the cabinet.

72
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,720
It was an,

73
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:58,910
uh,

74
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,510
an opening.

75
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,560
It was an omen cabinet.

76
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:01,820
So this is the PSA is,

77
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,390
you know,

78
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,350
shut cabinet doors because apparently I
have now learned after this happened to

79
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:11,351
me that this happens to a lot of people
and you can get a serious head injury as

80
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,060
like a football player by doing this.

81
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,040
So out.

82
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,680
Wow.

83
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,700
So just standing up.

84
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,480
So he stood up quick,

85
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,751
Bam.

86
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:19,230
Yeah.

87
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,011
Whacked your head.

88
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:22,600
Did you go unconscious or
did not go on conscious,

89
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:22,951
you know,

90
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,640
saw stars and everything,

91
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:25,450
but you know,

92
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,101
a lot of concussions,

93
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:27,820
it takes a few hours,

94
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,470
the brain starts to swell and it's not
till later that day that you really start

95
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,060
to feel like something's really wrong.

96
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:34,840
So,

97
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,420
um,

98
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,400
is that what happened to you?

99
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,150
Yes.

100
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,870
Yeah.

101
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,590
Um,

102
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,401
and you know,

103
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:39,960
it was,

104
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,890
there was no internal
bleeding or anything.

105
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,370
Um,

106
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,200
and so,

107
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,480
you know,

108
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,200
the doctor said,

109
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,591
oh,

110
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:45,880
you'll be fine and you know,

111
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:46,714
give it a week,

112
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,130
maybe a couple of weeks.

113
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,750
I come back after month,

114
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,560
they tell me,

115
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,861
Oh,

116
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:51,071
you know,

117
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:51,521
some people,

118
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:53,050
if it doesn't heal in the first month,

119
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,310
it takes three months.

120
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,780
And if it doesn't heal in three months,

121
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:56,591
it might be a year.

122
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:57,550
And if it's not a year,

123
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,990
maybe you're stuck like this.

124
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,530
Were you experiencing
the classic symptoms?

125
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,630
Like you couldn't like stare at the sun,

126
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:04,940
the sunlight would bother your eyes.

127
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,850
Loud noises.

128
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,151
Oh,

129
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:06,450
I mean,

130
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,051
all light.

131
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:07,884
Like if I,

132
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,340
I,

133
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,600
I would try to go into like a whole foods
or fluorescent lights would feel like

134
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:15,030
I was like under fire from weapons.

135
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:15,271
I mean,

136
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:15,690
I couldn't,

137
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,081
I was,

138
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:18,480
I was in bed basically for three months.

139
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,320
Everything,

140
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,470
like all stimulus would
make me nauseous and um,

141
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,210
migraines and everything.

142
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,470
So it was,

143
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,060
it's so it started out normal concussion,

144
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:30,990
but then it's kind of unraveled into
what they call post concussion syndrome,

145
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:31,824
which is,

146
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,663
um,

147
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,680
which is a thing that
I didn't know existed,

148
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:39,150
but a lot of people and the
concussions take up to a year to heal.

149
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,051
Yeah,

150
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:40,884
they can.

151
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,400
Well,

152
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,701
I,

153
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,300
uh,

154
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,410
from working for the UFC,

155
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:45,270
I've seen people that neglect those.

156
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,600
Yes.

157
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,311
And it,

158
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,460
it gets really ugly.

159
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:47,880
Yeah.

160
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,790
I've also seen people
that were great fighters.

161
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,390
There's a guy named Tj grant who
was in line for a UFC title shot,

162
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,110
uh,

163
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,130
got a concussion.

164
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,430
I'm not even from getting
kicked or punched,

165
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,060
it was from,

166
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,440
uh,

167
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,070
grappling exchange,

168
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:04,290
just bonked his head on something.

169
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:04,511
I've a,

170
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,830
I believe it was somebody's knee or
someone's hip or something like that and

171
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,740
then was never the same again
and has never fall again.

172
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,990
And it's been like,

173
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,530
I think almost two years.

174
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,300
Yeah.

175
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,440
And I mean that's something I've gotten
actually pretty active in the research

176
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,350
community and trying to share information.

177
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,290
So it turns out like the
first week of recovery,

178
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,980
uh,

179
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,420
can really determine if you're
going to go into this extended,

180
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,721
you know,

181
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:31,220
it's going to take you three months,

182
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:31,641
six months,

183
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:32,260
a year,

184
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,600
um,

185
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,081
if you're not,

186
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,670
if you're not resting enough in that,

187
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,600
that first week.

188
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,990
So the first week it's critical
that you just do nothing.

189
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,581
I mean,

190
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:44,290
they call it cognitive rest and basically
you want to not do anything that is,

191
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,660
that feels difficult for you.

192
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,560
And so for me,

193
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,850
I couldn't read,

194
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,810
I could only watch TV shows I'd already
seen before because having to process

195
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,670
plot Gnuplot was not,

196
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,600
uh,

197
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,291
was not helpful.

198
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,500
So I was walking like rewatching Buffy
the vampire slayer because I seen them

199
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,640
all like a million times.

200
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,810
Um,

201
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,300
and so,

202
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,621
and yet,

203
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:02,891
you know,

204
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,690
keep the lights off if they,

205
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:04,990
you know,

206
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,580
keep sunglasses on indoors.

207
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,300
Um,

208
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,070
but the first 48 hours
and then after that,

209
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:09,940
the first week,

210
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,600
uh,

211
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,630
if you can avoid over
stressing your brain,

212
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,200
you have a much better chance to recover
within the one to two week period as

213
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,043
well as people.

214
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,540
Yeah.

215
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,160
And people don't know
people like they tried to,

216
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,420
I tried to go right back to work.

217
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:26,170
I was in the middle of writing my first
book and it was due in a couple months.

218
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,710
I'm like,

219
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,820
I can't miss my deadline.

220
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,571
I've got to do this.

221
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:29,051
I've gotta power through.

222
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm going to can barely unlike,

223
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,230
can't even see the screen.

224
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,660
But you're,

225
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,290
when you're,

226
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:32,501
you know,

227
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:33,610
when you have a concussion,

228
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,960
you're not thinking clearly,

229
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,010
you are not irrational person.

230
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:38,380
You're just,

231
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,890
you're just like,

232
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,491
I have to do this.

233
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,270
I have to try.

234
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,500
And other people will
look at you and be like,

235
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,311
what's wrong with you?

236
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,144
You are,

237
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,930
you know,

238
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,711
totally out of it.

239
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,730
Why are you trying to work?

240
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,110
But you're not,

241
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,710
you don't have that same kind of
rational decision making ability.

242
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:51,544
So sometimes,

243
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,450
you know,

244
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,540
a friend or a loved one needs
to take you aside and say,

245
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,970
I'm not letting you do
anything for this first week.

246
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,350
You've just got to let your brain,

247
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:00,850
yeah,

248
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,010
and this is correct me if I'm wrong,

249
00:06:03,011 --> 00:06:04,330
but it's relatively new,

250
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:08,410
our understanding of what takes place
after concussion and what you have to do

251
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,460
to recover.

252
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,361
Yeah,

253
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:10,510
no,

254
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,380
there's just last year it was a big study
that came out showing that four months

255
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:15,490
after concussion,

256
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,300
your,

257
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,530
your brain is still different.

258
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:18,220
There's still,

259
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,490
uh,

260
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,500
it's like a kind of a
scarring that happens.

261
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,603
I get scab,

262
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,420
um,

263
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,900
that certain parts of the
brain will still be thickened,

264
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,830
um,

265
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,760
four months after,

266
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,710
even if you think you're feeling fine,

267
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,690
which means that you're still vulnerable.

268
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,021
You know,

269
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:33,490
if you were to get hit again,

270
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:34,510
it would be more dangerous.

271
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:34,990
And,

272
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,231
um,

273
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,420
and if you're still feeling
symptoms after four months,

274
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,721
you know,

275
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,960
that's why it's like when you cut
yourself open and you get the Scab,

276
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,570
uh,

277
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,570
you can't be picking at the scab by
doing things that are triggering your

278
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:47,494
symptoms.

279
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,480
Yeah.

280
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,230
Wow.

281
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,590
So who was it that told
you you got to settle down?

282
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,191
Well,

283
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:53,461
my,

284
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:53,940
you know,

285
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,710
my doctor had said that,

286
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:56,371
and of course I'm a,

287
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:57,520
I mean I'm a science geek that's,

288
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,560
I have a phd.

289
00:06:58,561 --> 00:06:59,610
It's like my background.

290
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,090
Um,

291
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,830
and I was having my husband Google do
Google scholar searches for traumatic

292
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:07,920
brain injury research cause I
couldn't use the computer just like,

293
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:08,641
you got to figure,

294
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,331
is this normal?

295
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:09,750
I'm like,

296
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,160
I started feeling suicidal.

297
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,233
That was,

298
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:12,780
uh,

299
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,920
that was new for me.

300
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,880
And I'm like literally having
him Google suicidal thoughts,

301
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,830
concussion because I'm like,

302
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,693
is this,

303
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,410
am I really suicidal?

304
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,711
Like,

305
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:26,250
am I rationally thinking I'm
never going to able to work again.

306
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:27,510
My husband's got to take care of me.

307
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,590
I should just end it.

308
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,780
Which is what I was looking like.

309
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,350
The voices in my head were saying,

310
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,480
but it didn't feel,

311
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,141
you know,

312
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:34,380
it's,

313
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,990
that didn't feel like myself.

314
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,060
And so fortunately he was
finding articles like,

315
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:39,331
wait,

316
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:42,690
one in three people with a concussion
have suicidal thoughts and that is

317
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:45,270
actually a reaction to the neurochemistry.

318
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:45,780
Um,

319
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,860
when you have a concussion,

320
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,140
you don't have dopamine
in the reward pathway,

321
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,250
reward pathways,

322
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,520
which means your brain can't
anticipate anything good in the future.

323
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,900
You become like completely unable
to imagine that you'll feel better,

324
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,430
that good things will happen for you.

325
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:04,431
And that's just like a perfect
neurochemical foundation for suicide.

326
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,540
So you were able to remember how you
used to think and so you knew this is not

327
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,050
the way I think.

328
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,560
Okay.

329
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,011
Yeah.

330
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:13,520
I mean it was,

331
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,000
I had,

332
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,833
I had like a,

333
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,730
I was able to distance myself a
little bit from the thoughts where,

334
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:18,950
you know,

335
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,400
I would,

336
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,810
I would,

337
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,420
I,

338
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:20,900
you know,

339
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,651
cause I was just at home,

340
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:22,221
I wasn't going anywhere.

341
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,330
I would say to my husband,

342
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,164
like,

343
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,140
I feel like I have this
voice that's saying,

344
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,381
you know,

345
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,490
you should kill yourself.

346
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:28,940
And I would,

347
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,200
I would talk about it because I didn't,

348
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,820
it,

349
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,031
I mean,

350
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:33,050
I think if you talk about it,

351
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,350
it,

352
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,730
it becomes less,

353
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,061
you know,

354
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,130
this feeling that you have that
you have to really believe and,

355
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:41,030
and more like the thing that you
can look at and try to figure out.

356
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,070
And um,

357
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,160
and uh,

358
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,160
and so it was like,

359
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,330
it just felt so weird
to me because I'm like,

360
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:48,050
why?

361
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,411
I don't know.

362
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,100
I had never,

363
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,600
I never had that before.

364
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,200
Um,

365
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,070
and once I knew that it was a
symptom of concussion rather than,

366
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,091
oh,

367
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:01,230
Jane has figured out that her life is
terrible and logically she wants to kill

368
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:01,740
herself,

369
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,540
I was able to live with it.

370
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,471
And you know,

371
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:07,440
the research literature says
they go away as the brain heals.

372
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,370
So I just thought,

373
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:08,980
okay,

374
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,480
and you know,

375
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,560
it might still,

376
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,870
I might still hear that voice for,

377
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,140
you know,

378
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,280
a few weeks or a few months,

379
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:18,510
but I know that that's a symptom of
healing and not have actually feel.

380
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,460
So I'm just going to get on with it.

381
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:20,981
Now.

382
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:24,160
Is there a medication that you
can take while this was going on?

383
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:27,970
Anything that speeds up the healing
or anti inflammation medication?

384
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:28,070
Yeah.

385
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,461
Right.

386
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,294
So this is,

387
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,810
this is what's so hard about
post concussion syndrome
is there's nothing that's

388
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,940
been shown to speed it up.

389
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,480
I mean,

390
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,260
I was offered really
powerful anti anxiety meds,

391
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,250
depression meds.

392
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:40,821
Um,

393
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:44,930
I chose not to take them because I
just didn't want to go down that road.

394
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,310
I'd never taken them before.

395
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,840
Yeah.

396
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,600
Um,

397
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,291
and uh,

398
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,160
and there's no known therapies.

399
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:54,161
People have tried to do like oxygen deep
oxygen therapy and hypobaric chamber.

400
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:54,680
Yes.

401
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:54,951
Yeah.

402
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:55,540
Yeah.

403
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,000
Um,

404
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,833
did you try any of that?

405
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,100
I did not try that.

406
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,023
Um,

407
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,923
but,

408
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,630
uh,

409
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,830
oh,

410
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,010
actually this is a sort
of very exciting for me.

411
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,520
Um,

412
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,353
I,

413
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,940
because there's no good
treatment for this.

414
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,020
When my game worked so well for me and
I saw other people started using it at

415
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:12,181
work,

416
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:12,621
well for them,

417
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:17,621
we were able to get a grant from the
NIH to test this with young athletes,

418
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,650
um,

419
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,900
through Ohio State University
Medical Research Center.

420
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,200
We just released our findings last
week that the game that I invented did

421
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,730
improve the post concussion syndromes
and 100% of the people who used it,

422
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:31,980
uh,

423
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,840
compared to only 50% of
people who didn't play.

424
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,430
So this is one of,

425
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,701
I mean,

426
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:41,360
this is one of the first
validated treatments that can,

427
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,930
you know,

428
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,170
reduce the headaches and the
nausea and the confusion and the,

429
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:45,860
you know,

430
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,693
difficulty.

431
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,150
So how did you get to the point where
you wanted to experiment with a game?

432
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:51,990
Your,

433
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,210
you're recovering slowly.

434
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,511
Like,

435
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:54,691
I mean,

436
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:55,920
how slow is this taking?

437
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,720
Like how many months afterwards?

438
00:10:57,721 --> 00:10:58,440
We still come.

439
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,810
Yeah,

440
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:58,980
well,

441
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,040
it's 34 days,

442
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,580
which I will,

443
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,600
I will never,

444
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,434
I don't like it.

445
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,500
It was,

446
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,450
it's emblazoned into my memory
34 days after I hit my head,

447
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,470
um,

448
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,430
that I was,

449
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,870
I'm always completely desperate.

450
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,850
I literally was saying to myself,

451
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,600
I'm going to kill myself or I'm going
to turn this into a game because

452
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,873
I mean,

453
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,990
those two options,

454
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,400
it's so strange.

455
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,111
I know,

456
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:25,710
but so maybe be the only person in human
history that's ever said that I'm going

457
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,600
to kill myself or I'm going
to turn this into a game.

458
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:27,851
Yes,

459
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:28,210
yes.

460
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,330
Well,

461
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,060
you know,

462
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,080
I love writing my first book,

463
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,360
which was all about the
psychology of games.

464
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,130
And I just thought to myself,

465
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,413
I should,

466
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,313
I got to prove it.

467
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,860
You know,

468
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,220
I,

469
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,180
I'm writing this book saying that playing
games makes us happier and stronger

470
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,050
and more resilient.

471
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,870
I got to prove this theory.

472
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,171
I mean,

473
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,670
there's all other kinds
of proof in the book,

474
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:46,971
but I'm like,

475
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:47,804
I'm going to live it.

476
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,620
Um,

477
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,220
and,

478
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,480
and,

479
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,570
and that was just,

480
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,990
I just,

481
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,010
I didn't know how else to
provoke the positive emotions.

482
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,640
And when we play games and his whole list
of positive emotions that we feel when

483
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:02,410
we play games like curiosity and
excitement and awe and wonder and pride,

484
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,130
and it's just like,

485
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,510
I gotta get some of these emotions because
my doctor had said the more depressed

486
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:08,410
and anxious you are,

487
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,960
that can actually slow
down the healing process.

488
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,150
It is actually a detrimental,

489
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,530
right if you,

490
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,550
if you fuel,

491
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,220
if you can feed the freshman anxiety

492
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,031
detrimental in,

493
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:23,031
in terms of measurable effects
or detrimental in terms
of the way you feel like

494
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:23,740
that,

495
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,340
that,

496
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,431
uh,

497
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:24,940
from,

498
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,480
uh,

499
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,480
the brain's ability to
heal the neurochemistry of
depression is not conducive to

500
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:34,470
that.

501
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,120
So literally being depressed can slow
down the physical healing of the brain

502
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:39,650
itself.

503
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,483
Yes.

504
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,110
And so they're like,

505
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,501
you know,

506
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,970
so try not to worry.

507
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,481
And I'm like,

508
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:44,571
well,

509
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:44,840
Geez,

510
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,320
I know.

511
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,680
I was like,

512
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,090
I can't get out of bed.

513
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,991
My books do.

514
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,530
I can't write.

515
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,890
My husband had lost his job a
few months earlier and I'm like,

516
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,500
I may never work and I'm going
to be like a Barista now.

517
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,570
This is like maybe if I can stand,

518
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,463
you know?

519
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,413
Yeah.

520
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,151
So,

521
00:12:59,151 --> 00:12:59,600
uh,

522
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,070
so the 34 days,

523
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,600
yeah.

524
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,100
What is the 34 days were
when it was at its worst,

525
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:04,500
is that right?

526
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:04,860
I just,

527
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,693
I mean,

528
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,720
it just,

529
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,500
everyone kept saying,

530
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,591
oh,

531
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:08,670
you'll be fine in a few days.

532
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,730
So we find a few weeks and then I
went and saw my doctor after 30 days.

533
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,230
And then the doctor said,

534
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,281
uh Oh yeah.

535
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:14,881
By the way,

536
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,100
some people don't get better in a month.

537
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,090
Those people,

538
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,230
it often takes three months.

539
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,580
And uh,

540
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:23,100
for people who don't get better in
three months and it often takes a year,

541
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,200
and if you're not better than a year,

542
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,790
then you might be like this forever.

543
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,930
And I was like,

544
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,770
oh my God.

545
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,390
It just,

546
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,021
it made me,

547
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,370
it kind of freaked me out.

548
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,200
So did you experiment with
things during this time?

549
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,810
Like w w when you were researching?

550
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,930
I mean,

551
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,930
the only thing that I really experiment
with was a tiny eat things with,

552
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,040
uh,

553
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,660
like Omega is the Omega three,

554
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,231
Omega six,

555
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,580
which are supposed to be good for,

556
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,220
for brain healing.

557
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:54,650
And there is some scientific
literature on that where,

558
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,000
I mean doctors will say,

559
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,834
eat walnuts,

560
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,560
you know,

561
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,070
donuts.

562
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,490
Yeah.

563
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,960
Cause that's a good like,

564
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,153
uh,

565
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,761
it's,

566
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:02,060
it's,

567
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,250
it's available to them off real good.

568
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:04,670
It's,

569
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:04,911
I mean,

570
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,080
I suppose if it can be a capsule,

571
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,720
you can absorb things better from food.

572
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,700
What does walnut wallets,

573
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,870
it's like omega three omega
six fatty acids in fish oil.

574
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,270
Uh,

575
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,290
I'm one of those weird vegans.

576
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:17,741
Oh,

577
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:18,574
how dare you.

578
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,860
What about a hemp oil?

579
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,940
Does that have yeah,

580
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,460
hemp is good.

581
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,480
Hemp is really good too.

582
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:24,841
Yeah.

583
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:25,680
But at the time,

584
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,160
I don't know,

585
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,610
the only thing I could kind of
get it together to do was walnuts.

586
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,150
Hmm.

587
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,660
Okay.

588
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,780
So walnuts where it,

589
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,300
yeah.

590
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,430
[inaudible] is uh,

591
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,330
oh wife.

592
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,060
What do I do that well
is a football player.

593
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,320
It was a famous football player and he
suffered a lot of concussions and created

594
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,940
something called neuro one.

595
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,020
And uh,

596
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,760
it's uh,

597
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,760
a nootropic blend and he created it to
deal with some of the symptoms that he

598
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,990
had had or some of the repercussions
from all the head trauma that he had a,

599
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,560
so I was wondering if
you'd ever tried anything.

600
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,351
I have not.

601
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,351
I know there are a lot of that sort
of nutraceutical like interest in

602
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,650
experimenting with that.

603
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,820
I did not try that

604
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,930
because of the dopamine.

605
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:10,750
I was wondering like Serotonin,

606
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,400
like five HTP is really good for,

607
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,120
yeah.

608
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,400
Rebuilding Serotonin or
building blocks with Sarah.

609
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,970
Yeah.

610
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,950
I didn't get it together
to try any of that.

611
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,180
So you were just really struggling.

612
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,830
I was struggling.

613
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,131
I mean,

614
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:22,550
I would,

615
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,383
I would like,

616
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,540
I would sit on the bathroom
floor and like cry for hours,

617
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,420
but quietly.

618
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:27,480
Oh.

619
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,430
Like I didn't want my husband,

620
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,040
different Gal.

621
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,580
Nice,

622
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,413
very polite.

623
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,383
And your depression,

624
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,220
it seems counter intuitive to someone
who doesn't know anything like me that

625
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,330
you're saying that you could only watch
like Buffy the vampire slayer because

626
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:40,380
he'd already seen it before,

627
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,130
but playing your game
like decent part of yeah.

628
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,200
So stimulating,

629
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,570
right?

630
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:45,751
No,

631
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,490
and actually I couldn't play video games.

632
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:49,860
I would try to play like peggle I was,

633
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,380
I was like,

634
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,211
Tayga will be easy.

635
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:51,900
It's like a,

636
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,030
it's like a kind of pinball game,

637
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,600
uh,

638
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,360
where you shoot little pinballs
around pop pigs and it's a,

639
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:59,070
and they played like
the Hallelujah chorus,

640
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:00,180
every level you complete.

641
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:00,541
So I was like,

642
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,090
Yay,

643
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,430
and I'm successful.

644
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:03,840
They're like playing a prayed for me.

645
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,480
Uh,

646
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:04,830
I'm like,

647
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,130
that'll,

648
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,431
I'm like,

649
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,330
that'll really help.

650
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:06,990
Help me.

651
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,260
Um,

652
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,940
but even that was too stimulating.

653
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,750
Um,

654
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,270
so I couldn't play video games.

655
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:11,851
So the game,

656
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,830
I meant it was not a video game.

657
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,101
I mean,

658
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:18,210
we did eventually make an APP and
a web version so people could,

659
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,810
could,

660
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,740
other people could play,

661
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,670
but it was more like just a set
of rules that I would follow.

662
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,803
Um,

663
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,321
you know,

664
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:25,950
like you wouldn't like,

665
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,041
oh,

666
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,870
how do you play hide and seek
or how do you play poker?

667
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,150
Just like learn the rules and play.

668
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,780
Uh,

669
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,410
so I just started making up rules for
myself about doing things that you would

670
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,340
do in a video game,

671
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:39,750
like collecting power ups or spotting
like making lists of the bad guys and all

672
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:43,440
the ways like where they would show up
and what my strategies were for fighting

673
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:43,801
them.

674
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:44,680
And um,

675
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,140
coming up with a quest list.

676
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,890
So like,

677
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,370
what's something I can do in the
next 24 hours to feel better,

678
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,070
like something concrete
that I can accomplish.

679
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,310
And so just starting to
approach my recovery with
these really concrete gameful

680
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,520
strategies.

681
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,130
Um,

682
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,820
and really the,

683
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,120
the,

684
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,331
you know,

685
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:06,120
the first thing I did was I
adopted the secret identity.

686
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,080
Like my avatar.

687
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:10,920
I was going to have an Avatar in my
recovery and that was Jane the concussion

688
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:11,400
slayer.

689
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,300
Because I'm like,

690
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,601
oh,

691
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,710
I'm going to be like Buffy.

692
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:16,800
And Buffy did not choose to be the slayer.

693
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,281
Right?

694
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:18,510
Like they just hold her.

695
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,231
You're this layer,

696
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,310
you have to save the world.

697
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:20,730
And I'm like,

698
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,500
I did not choose to hit my head,

699
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,590
so I'm going to be like her
and just arise to the occasion.

700
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,010
Um,

701
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,010
and kind of try to tap into my inner
sense of determination and being a Badass.

702
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,610
And so what did you do like after you
took on this persona or adopted the idea

703
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,360
of this Avatar?

704
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,380
Like what did you do?

705
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:41,640
Like what were your power ups?

706
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,050
Like who are the bad guys?

707
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:43,161
Like,

708
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:43,321
yeah,

709
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:43,710
yeah.

710
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:43,980
Um,

711
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,280
and bad guys wear anything
that would trigger my symptoms.

712
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,611
Um,

713
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:47,120
so,

714
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,570
you know,

715
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,560
bright lights,

716
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,860
a crowded space,

717
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,370
um,

718
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:50,581
you know,

719
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,570
conversation,

720
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,890
I mean everything.

721
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,610
Um,

722
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,443
but the thing with,

723
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,470
with bad guys and like,

724
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,681
you know,

725
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,760
in a video game like,

726
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,230
oh,

727
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,063
there is,

728
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,921
there's a monster,

729
00:17:58,921 --> 00:17:59,701
you don't run away.

730
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:03,540
You got to figure out how you're
going to tackle it or get past it.

731
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:03,961
So,

732
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:07,470
and the same is true with recovery
from any kind of injury or illness.

733
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,030
You have to keep testing the limits,

734
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:09,301
right?

735
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,420
Cause otherwise you wind
up never getting better.

736
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:16,110
You kind of convinced that you're
just flat on your back forever.

737
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:17,790
And this is sort of an aside,

738
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,430
but as I was doing all the
research for this new book,

739
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,350
I found out that the number one predictor
of disability after a back injury is

740
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,410
avoiding things that make your
back hurt early on during recovery.

741
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,700
So you would think like,

742
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:32,911
oh,

743
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:33,744
you have to,

744
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,680
you know,

745
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,100
don't,

746
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,290
don't do anything that
will make your back worse.

747
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,020
But the longer you keep that mindset,

748
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,380
that's a number one predictor of
who becomes chronically disabled.

749
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,340
You're not able to work,

750
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:44,780
are there,

751
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,010
their life is affected in
a major way and it's not,

752
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:49,560
the severity of the injury is
not the severity of the pain.

753
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,640
Um,

754
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,610
and so with all kinds of
injury and illness now,

755
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,140
because you get stuck in that pattern,

756
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,050
you never really thinking
yourself as injured.

757
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,590
Yes.

758
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,130
Yeah.

759
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,940
And uh,

760
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,810
so you know,

761
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:01,590
it's like,

762
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,430
but with all of these things,

763
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:03,270
it's a careful balance.

764
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:05,340
So you have to recognize
that the bad guys are bad.

765
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,420
I can't,

766
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,130
I can't go out and be in a
crowded space for three hours.

767
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:10,860
It can't go to like a lady Gaga concert,

768
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,930
which I really wanted to do.

769
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,240
I'm like,

770
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,073
[inaudible] not going to do that.

771
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,130
Uh,

772
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,210
I said that it's kind of like a,

773
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:17,280
I'm like the next time she
comes through that'll be like,

774
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,290
what am I epic wins when I can go see her.

775
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,393
Um,

776
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,590
but like you can do little things to task.

777
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:26,910
Let me go into the whole foods and see
how many minutes I can make it before the

778
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:27,810
symptoms come back.

779
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,400
So you kind of like testing,

780
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,641
oh,

781
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,050
today was 30 seconds,

782
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,913
I got to leave.

783
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,080
Maybe next week it'll be five minutes.

784
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:36,570
And then you kind of start to get your
life back because you don't want to get

785
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:41,571
on that course towards seeing yourself
as is kind of chronically disabled.

786
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:41,821
So,

787
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:42,331
so that's,

788
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:42,900
you know,

789
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,520
you come up with these ways to,

790
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,290
to battle the bad guys,

791
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,800
you know,

792
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,290
every day.

793
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,500
And in the version that
we tested with the NIH,

794
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,890
that's the game is activate
three power ups a day.

795
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,630
So for me that might have been eating
walnuts or like cuddling my dog,

796
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,570
cause that made me feel
like safe and happy.

797
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:02,670
So anything that provokes
a positive emotion,

798
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:07,020
if you're depressed and you have to really
find what are the things that can get

799
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,310
through that depression and,

800
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,840
and still make you feel good.

801
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,140
So,

802
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,400
you know,

803
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,161
cuddle my dog,

804
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:11,994
I'd eat walnuts.

805
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,560
Do you do three of those a day?

806
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,400
One bad guy battle a day where he
really test the limits to see if you're

807
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:18,234
getting better.

808
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,690
Um,

809
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,890
and one quest today,

810
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,160
which is the smallest possible thing you
can do that we'll kind of move you in

811
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,220
the direction of your goal or recovery
or just feel like something productive

812
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,361
that you want to do.

813
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,890
So I remember one time I,

814
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,581
my quest,

815
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:37,581
I decided to bake cookies for the Baristas
at the coffee place down this area

816
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:37,711
is,

817
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:38,041
I'm like,

818
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:38,201
I,

819
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:40,350
I cause I could felt like I
couldn't do anything for myself.

820
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,621
So I'm like,

821
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:42,540
I'm going to bake cookies
for someone else today.

822
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,220
And,

823
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,530
uh,

824
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,350
as a result randomly I want of getting
free coffee for a year because they were

825
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:47,900
like,

826
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,550
I cannot believe somebody came like down
with this giant plate of cookies fresh

827
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,384
out of the oven.

828
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,200
Um,

829
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,820
but I did not,

830
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,970
I did not expect that.

831
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,540
Um,

832
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,260
but that was just like,

833
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,810
you know,

834
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,420
find one thing I can do today
that will have a positive impact.

835
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,200
Um,

836
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,033
and that's,

837
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,480
that's the sort of,

838
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,890
there's other stuff you know,

839
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,671
in the game,

840
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:07,870
but that's sort of the main,

841
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,551
you're,

842
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:13,551
you're basically using game gain models
to kind of structure your life to make

843
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,390
sure that you're staying engaged,

844
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,830
not hiding,

845
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,280
you know,

846
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,260
actually making progress
to getting better.

847
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,580
This sounds really difficult.

848
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,230
More difficult than I think most people
would ever imagine recovering from a

849
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:28,041
concussion would be.

850
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,930
I think most people would think that.

851
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:30,950
I wouldn't,

852
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,731
don't want to say most people,

853
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:32,990
let me just say what I would think.

854
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,100
I haven't had a concussion,

855
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:36,200
I don't think since I was probably 20.

856
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,850
And I would think that what it
would be like would be like,

857
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,361
ah,

858
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:41,631
man,

859
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:42,441
it feels like shit.

860
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,370
Let me just lie down here.

861
00:21:43,371 --> 00:21:44,600
I'll put ice on my head,

862
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,940
I'll watch TV or something
and I'll just go to,

863
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:47,960
I'll take a lot of naps,

864
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,320
right?

865
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,080
Like you think it'll feel like a
hangover or something like that.

866
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,280
The problem is that your
thinking becomes muddled too.

867
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,780
So it's not just that you
have these physical symptoms,

868
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,670
you're not able to think clearly.

869
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:01,230
You're not thinking like yourself.

870
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,670
And that can really lead
to a lot of confusion,

871
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,990
bad decisions.

872
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:07,350
You know,

873
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,183
people,

874
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,053
uh,

875
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,800
they,

876
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,170
they,

877
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,070
they try to hide the severity of the
symptoms because they think that,

878
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,520
uh,

879
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,353
it will,

880
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,253
you know,

881
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
other people will judge
them or they're like,

882
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,300
there's a lot of it that's very common.

883
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,710
I've now learned with concussions.

884
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:25,410
People hide the severity of
symptoms because there's like,

885
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,190
you just,

886
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,520
you're,

887
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,180
you're not thinking clearly and you think
it's important that other people not

888
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,020
really see.

889
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,530
Um,

890
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:31,811
but I've,

891
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:36,300
I've of become this sort of weird
spokes person slash guru for concussions

892
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:37,920
because of my ted talk about it.

893
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,240
So every day,

894
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,700
literally I hear on Facebook or
Twitter from someone who's like,

895
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:43,680
just been concussed and they're like,

896
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,723
what do I do?

897
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,360
Um,

898
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
and I actually,

899
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,010
uh,

900
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,281
I mean,

901
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:47,940
I,

902
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,271
you know,

903
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:48,601
I feel like,

904
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:48,930
okay,

905
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,681
I'm your ally.

906
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:50,730
And I'm like always,

907
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:51,001
you know,

908
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,370
sending direct messages
to like random people.

909
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:53,821
I don't know,

910
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:58,320
checking in on them to see I'm feeling
great thing because it's not even like if

911
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
your friends or family
will not understand,

912
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,020
they will think,

913
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,231
oh,

914
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,110
you'll be out on the couch for three
days and they expect you to be back to

915
00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:04,471
normal.

916
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:06,390
And they don't understand
why three months,

917
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:07,290
four months later,

918
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,940
you're still struggling.

919
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,080
It's not,

920
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:10,621
I mean,

921
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,140
it has not been discussed enough,

922
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,610
although I think that's changing now.

923
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:15,090
People,

924
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,480
especially with so many soldiers
coming back with longterm,

925
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,410
uh,

926
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,310
symptoms of,

927
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,330
of the concussions.

928
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:22,710
No.

929
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,710
The other thing that's confusing to
me with this is that in the beginning,

930
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,450
the first stage of your concussion,

931
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,210
it's critical.

932
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,890
You do nothing.

933
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,723
Right?

934
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,150
But then after a while
you're like pushing it.

935
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:36,301
Like,

936
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:36,611
how,

937
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:38,400
how much time can I spend
at whole foods for free?

938
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:38,610
Go,

939
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,060
right.

940
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,600
Yeah.

941
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,470
Like many people would think that
that's sort of counter intuitive.

942
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,731
Yeah,

943
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:43,881
yeah,

944
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:44,340
yeah.

945
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,641
Well,

946
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:48,590
in the is when the brain
needs the most resources,

947
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,011
right?

948
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,010
So you don't mind early stages like,

949
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,300
yeah,

950
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,040
how many days?

951
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,800
So depending on the studies you read,

952
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,810
it'll say between 48 hours to one week
is the most crucial stage where you want,

953
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,670
where you want the most cognitive
rest and you want to avoid,

954
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,850
um,

955
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,780
it basically just exhausting
the brain because blood,

956
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,420
anything you do that's
cognitively demanding,

957
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,140
it directs blood flow to
different regions of the brain.

958
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,330
You don't want your brain spending time
trying to figure out your email instead

959
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:20,810
of,

960
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,001
you know,

961
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:21,710
because there's only,

962
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,480
there's only so much blood to flow around.

963
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,140
Um,

964
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,973
and you don't,

965
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,440
you don't want it to be spent and,

966
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:27,680
and,

967
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,580
and try and do an email will require
so much more effort from you than it

968
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:32,181
normally would.

969
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,830
So it's a sort of like vicious cycle.

970
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,910
Um,

971
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,660
now eventually the brain kind
of gets into this sort of,

972
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,430
I don't know,

973
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,640
spaces where it's like,

974
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,090
okay,

975
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,290
now we're working or you've got your,

976
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,790
you've got kind of your thickened up.

977
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,570
Um,

978
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,740
lesions that's going to take,

979
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,190
you know,

980
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,990
four months to kind of dissolve and,

981
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,550
and,

982
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,120
and be back to normal.

983
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,080
Um,

984
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,160
so you can,

985
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,100
you can test and you can say engage and,

986
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,720
and not being engaged.

987
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,700
We'll feel depression and anxiety.

988
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:02,390
So partly it's like you're trying to
balance the mental health with the

989
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:03,230
cognitive health.

990
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:03,861
I mean you can't,

991
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:07,010
if you were to do
cognitive rest for a month,

992
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,850
if you like being in solitary confinement
and we know that that has really bad

993
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,800
mental health affects.

994
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,843
Right.

995
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,051
So,

996
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:15,560
um,

997
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,100
your kind of figuring
this out as you go along,

998
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,160
there's really not a
road map that's set out.

999
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,080
No one's ever done this before and you
just sort of take your game designing

1000
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:32,081
skills and apply what you know about
the positive effects of games and you

1001
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,690
experiment on yourself like a Guinea pig.

1002
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,310
Yeah,

1003
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,730
I was worried that you might be
fucking your brain up or Nah,

1004
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:41,564
I'm like

1005
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,700
what could be worse than
what was already happening.

1006
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,060
Um,

1007
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,601
and I mean,

1008
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:50,440
I'll like literally within 48 hours the,

1009
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,500
that fog that like super black,

1010
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:53,891
you know,

1011
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:54,351
you wanted,

1012
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:56,530
I fog was gone and it was,

1013
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,570
it none of the symptoms and go
and it was as can cost as I was,

1014
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:01,960
but that,

1015
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,140
that feeling of hopelessness
really went away.

1016
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,380
And because of the fun of it.

1017
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,341
So this is,

1018
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:13,270
this is why I wrote the book because
I didn't really understand why worked.

1019
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:17,020
I knew it worked for me and then I put
the rules online and people started

1020
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:19,990
writing me from all over the
world that they were using it.

1021
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:21,940
And not just for concussions.

1022
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:22,071
I mean,

1023
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:24,130
people were writing for,

1024
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:24,371
you know,

1025
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:25,300
I have cancer,

1026
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:27,010
I just had knee surgery.

1027
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,791
Someone you know,

1028
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,490
who was just like noticed
with als starts playing it.

1029
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:31,810
And uh,

1030
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,290
um,

1031
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,123
it,

1032
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,550
it,

1033
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,660
it seems to be,

1034
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,330
it seemed to be extraordinary
effective at treating depression,

1035
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:41,680
anxiety and also making
people feel just stronger,

1036
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,220
just like better of themselves.

1037
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,960
And I did not understand it.

1038
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:46,794
And this is,

1039
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,240
I say this all the time people,

1040
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:53,241
because there can be a lot of skepticism
that a game can be helpful during a

1041
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:54,780
really serious,

1042
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,530
uh,

1043
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,640
challenge in your life.

1044
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,900
It sounds like trivial.

1045
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,734
It sounds stupid.

1046
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,431
Um,

1047
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:00,570
so I freely acknowledged,

1048
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,890
I didn't understand why it worked.

1049
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:05,700
It seemed kind of absurd to me for people
with much more serious problems and I

1050
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:06,534
had to,

1051
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,080
um,

1052
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,310
so that's why I wrote the book.

1053
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,420
It's why I started doing,

1054
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,860
in our clinical trial and the studies
we've been doing for the last few years to

1055
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:18,240
try to understand because I didn't at all
I knew was that it seemed to be having

1056
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:19,590
all these positive effects and that,

1057
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
uh,

1058
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,020
that was,

1059
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,620
it was,

1060
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,070
I mean even to a game designer like
myself who believes in the power of games,

1061
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,200
I was really taken off guard.

1062
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,190
Right.

1063
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,440
So how did you structure it?

1064
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,010
Like,

1065
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:37,010
did you first start off just coming up
with things like power pills or walnuts

1066
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:42,171
and bad guys or depression and how did
you like put this whole thing together?

1067
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,261
Yeah,

1068
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:43,441
I mean,

1069
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:44,700
I just started making youtube videos,

1070
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:45,331
which is really funny.

1071
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,270
You can go back and look at like
the first youtube videos of me.

1072
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:48,630
It's like,

1073
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,620
I don't think Scott,

1074
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:53,390
like why I'm making a game for my
concussion or something like that.

1075
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,860
And First Youtube video you made,

1076
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,960
what were you still suffering?

1077
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,421
Oh yeah.

1078
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:57,571
Yeah,

1079
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:58,320
yeah.

1080
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,450
How many months was it into?

1081
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,291
I thought this is like,

1082
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,390
I think on day 34 this
is like the day I'm like,

1083
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,320
I'm making a game.

1084
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,840
I'm going to make a youtube
video explaining the game.

1085
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,670
What's it like to when
you watch that video now?

1086
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:08,851
Oh,

1087
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:10,290
it's crazy because I can't,

1088
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,921
you can see,

1089
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,300
I can't think of words.

1090
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,790
Aye.

1091
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,240
Aye.

1092
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,640
Aye.

1093
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,473
Aye.

1094
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,170
Yeah,

1095
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:15,420
yeah,

1096
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,581
yeah,

1097
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:16,080
yeah.

1098
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,561
What is it?

1099
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,394
What would it be under?

1100
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,370
Why I'm making a game?

1101
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:21,121
Concussion,

1102
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,110
something like that.

1103
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,420
Jamie.

1104
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,090
You'll find it.

1105
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:24,780
Yeah.

1106
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,090
Cause it's like you can see I can't,

1107
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,840
I can't,

1108
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,060
I mean,

1109
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,050
you see how fast I talk.

1110
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:28,884
Am I right?

1111
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,731
I'm like talking.

1112
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:30,031
Really.

1113
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,170
So how long ago was this?

1114
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,000
Five years ago?

1115
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,500
Yeah.

1116
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,820
And how long do you think it was
before you felt like 100% you again?

1117
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,180
I mean,

1118
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,210
so I'm like 99% right now.

1119
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:42,691
Maybe.

1120
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:42,871
Yeah.

1121
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,370
I mean there's still not 100%.

1122
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:44,761
No,

1123
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:45,161
there's the,

1124
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:45,361
yeah,

1125
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,640
there's still some things
like certain lights.

1126
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,260
I can't be around.

1127
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,180
Like it's,

1128
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,790
it creates,

1129
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,211
it's like,

1130
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:52,980
it feels like I'm having five years later.

1131
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,053
Yeah.

1132
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,451
Well let's,

1133
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:55,500
let's play this real quick.

1134
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,323
Okay.

1135
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,800
I am making this video to
explain and project some volume.

1136
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,820
Jack hijacked a game to help the recovery
process that I'm dealing with it after

1137
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:18,971
I hit my head and got a concussion and
that was about five weeks ago and their

1138
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:27,000
recovery has been very slow and hard.

1139
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:28,731
So,

1140
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:29,564
um,

1141
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,580
it's getting to a point where I feel like
I need again to help me get what I was

1142
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:40,580
doing some research today
about post concussion syndrome,

1143
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:44,140
which is what definitely told that
weird artifacts and the sound will

1144
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,500
concentrating trouble.

1145
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:46,721
I mean,

1146
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,030
I'm probably just sitting
there with my laptop in my lap.

1147
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,033
Um,

1148
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,520
serious planning,

1149
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,890
mental problem solving that would give
me a concussion pickler and having a very

1150
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:57,520
hard time.

1151
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,630
I was not a pro.

1152
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,970
Um,

1153
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,960
and uh,

1154
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:03,460
and I get dizzy a lot.

1155
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,180
Um,

1156
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,730
and I get headaches and nauseous,

1157
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,573
that kind of thing.

1158
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,371
It's definitely,

1159
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:07,500
yeah.

1160
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,740
Can really see clearly you're,

1161
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,700
you're moving way,

1162
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:12,690
way slower.

1163
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:14,100
You're talking way slower.

1164
00:30:14,101 --> 00:30:15,060
You can see you're struggling.

1165
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,320
No.

1166
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:15,830
Yeah,

1167
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,360
yeah,

1168
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:16,520
yeah.

1169
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,820
Unless you're on meth right now.

1170
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,010
I am a naturally very energetic person.

1171
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,320
It's fascinating to me
that you're not 100% still.

1172
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,541
Yeah.

1173
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,020
I mean,

1174
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,020
you know it and I'm not sure entirely
why I was knocked out once when I was

1175
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,990
younger,

1176
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,510
like knocked out for like five minutes.

1177
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,230
Um,

1178
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,741
what happened?

1179
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:38,420
I fell off a sliding board.

1180
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,913
What's a sliding?

1181
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,360
I feel like a Philadelphia thing.

1182
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:41,920
I don't know.

1183
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,230
Uh,

1184
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,400
like a slide like,

1185
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:43,700
uh,

1186
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,490
like at the playgrounds
that you go down there.

1187
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:45,850
Oh,

1188
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,330
fried chicken Philly.

1189
00:30:47,331 --> 00:30:52,010
We called it sliding boards and I fell
right off the side and hit my head on a

1190
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:53,330
cement block.

1191
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,710
Oh yeah.

1192
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,940
That's what I was really young.

1193
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,140
That was my first concussion.

1194
00:30:57,141 --> 00:30:58,000
So that's probably

1195
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,140
what's going on to,

1196
00:30:59,230 --> 00:30:59,841
as it were,

1197
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:00,980
repeated concussions,

1198
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:01,190
right?

1199
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,331
No,

1200
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:01,430
no.

1201
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,380
What's interesting is I was so young,

1202
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,490
I did not,

1203
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:04,941
I was like,

1204
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:06,440
I don't know if it's
like four or something.

1205
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,750
I actually didn't know
that I'd had a concussion.

1206
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:11,090
I thought this was my
first concussion in 2009.

1207
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:11,631
And the doctor's like,

1208
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:11,751
oh,

1209
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:12,650
have you had a concussion port?

1210
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,450
No.

1211
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:13,640
Um,

1212
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,510
because obviously everyone knows
now if you have more than one,

1213
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:18,380
it can start to,

1214
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,790
the healing will take longer.

1215
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,210
I didn't know until like
a month into my injury,

1216
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:25,640
I'm talking to my parents
and they mentioned,

1217
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,331
well,

1218
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:26,841
you know,

1219
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:30,590
the last time you had a concussion you
were feeling better and much faster.

1220
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:31,130
And I'm like,

1221
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,963
what?

1222
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,600
What,

1223
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,680
what last time?

1224
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:33,891
Oh,

1225
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,950
you remember when you fell off
the sliding board when you were,

1226
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,873
you know,

1227
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,140
anything when there were four.

1228
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,280
I know,

1229
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,850
uh,

1230
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,920
my five year old doesn't remember
anything when she was four.

1231
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,240
No.

1232
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,380
Like,

1233
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,700
you know,

1234
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,500
when you broke your collarbone,

1235
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:45,741
I'm like,

1236
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:45,831
oh,

1237
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:48,680
I do remember like wearing
a sling for collarbone,

1238
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:50,750
but I didn't know that I had a concussion.

1239
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,710
So,

1240
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,430
uh,

1241
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,740
so even though you were
four and then the next one,

1242
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:55,461
you were an adult.

1243
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:56,294
It's still

1244
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,140
maybe,

1245
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,411
I mean,

1246
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:57,880
it's,

1247
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,200
I,

1248
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,740
I,

1249
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,573
eh,

1250
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,970
people like Reese,

1251
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,550
the fines does not quite
understand how this works yet.

1252
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,350
Like if,

1253
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,680
if the cumulative Knox have to be all
within the same few years or if it can

1254
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:10,880
stretch out over a lifetime.

1255
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:14,030
I try not to think about it
too much because I'm like,

1256
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,510
you know,

1257
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:14,781
God,

1258
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:16,550
if it happens again that I'm really,

1259
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,473
you know,

1260
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,441
but I'm actually,

1261
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:21,660
I like walk around like
this covering yeah,

1262
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:21,890
give,

1263
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,041
I'm,

1264
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:22,880
if I'm at like at a,

1265
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,480
you know,

1266
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,790
like a concert or like in a 200 a element.

1267
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,920
I literally want,

1268
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:29,810
if I'm like at a nightclub or something,

1269
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,860
I want to wear a helmet.

1270
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,840
I'm like wondering if
I can bring that back.

1271
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,710
I stayed a girl that
used to go to mosh pits.

1272
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,880
It was crazy.

1273
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,390
And uh,

1274
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:41,570
she got headbutted by a dude once she
came over to my apartment after she,

1275
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:41,690
uh,

1276
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,930
had been marching and she's like
holding her head and I'm like,

1277
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:45,764
what do you deal with?

1278
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,900
I think she went to see
some crazy fucking bad,

1279
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:51,770
I'm trying to remember the,

1280
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,360
is there a band called the creeps?

1281
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,281
It was,

1282
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:55,551
yeah,

1283
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:59,000
it was in Boston and like 88 89.

1284
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,820
So we should be wearing helmets.

1285
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,830
You definitely don't get
headbutted in a mosh pit.

1286
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,683
Yeah.

1287
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,520
But I would think like there's certain
assholes like drunken dummies and you'd

1288
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,770
go out to places you,

1289
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:10,540
you know,

1290
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:10,721
no.

1291
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:11,541
And I'm short,

1292
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,640
so I'm always worried about the elbows.

1293
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,630
Someone's like reaching for something,

1294
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,670
some big dude.

1295
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:17,504
We'll just,

1296
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,260
I mean,

1297
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,810
even like on planes when people
are taking down their luggage,

1298
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,760
I like cower by the
windows or by the window.

1299
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,603
Smart.

1300
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,060
Yeah.

1301
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,770
That's um,

1302
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,080
the,

1303
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,390
the recognition of vulnerabilities,

1304
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:29,620
uh,

1305
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,230
an issue with people that get hurt because
then all of a sudden you realize you

1306
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:36,110
can get hurt and sometimes you just
walk on eggshells all the time.

1307
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:37,910
It reduces the quality of your life.

1308
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,960
Exactly.

1309
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,351
And that's,

1310
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:39,591
I mean,

1311
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:40,424
that's sort of,

1312
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,990
that gets to that idea of,

1313
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,740
you know,

1314
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,060
spotting the bag eyes,

1315
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:46,730
things that could hurt you and
then you decide kind of how,

1316
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,980
how comfortable you are.

1317
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,090
You can't just run away.

1318
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:51,380
You can't just hide.

1319
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,950
You have to kind of push your
comfort limits a little bit.

1320
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,430
Um,

1321
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,840
so I'm not going to go skiing.

1322
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,270
I that ski ski.

1323
00:33:59,271 --> 00:33:59,600
Yeah.

1324
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,051
Wow.

1325
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:00,830
I didn't think certain.

1326
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,400
There's certain things now that I feel
like it's not worth the risk to me.

1327
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,413
A third,

1328
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,170
you know,

1329
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,040
I can only imagine.

1330
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,950
I just started skiing at 45.

1331
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,350
It's my first time skiing.

1332
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,490
I fucking wiped out hard last year,

1333
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,620
but that's fine.

1334
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:14,860
Just,

1335
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,960
and didn't hit my head and
I'm pretty good at falling.

1336
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,200
I know how to fall or Tom
molden rolled with it,

1337
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:21,740
but I was like,

1338
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,101
dude,

1339
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,690
I was going to fast when I wiped.

1340
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:24,500
Oh yeah,

1341
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,990
there's a video that's online too.

1342
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,040
We retweeted earlier today.

1343
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,460
This fucking kid is in Colorado and he's
on a skateboard and he's going 70 miles

1344
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:39,950
an hour down a hill and you just watch it.

1345
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:44,690
And like every part of my
body's like tingling with fear,

1346
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,290
you know,

1347
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,660
that anticipation injuries.

1348
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,470
Just,

1349
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,400
you tweeted that.

1350
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:51,120
Did you treat the roof topper?

1351
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,360
Like the guy in Russia?

1352
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,683
So,

1353
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,350
you know,

1354
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,720
I'm really interested in like neuro hacks,

1355
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,690
how you can do little
things to like change,

1356
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,400
like how your brain is working right now.

1357
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,120
Um,

1358
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,871
and that video,

1359
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:05,450
it seemed to me would be really good
for people to get a little bit of

1360
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:06,410
adrenaline going.

1361
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,920
If you're like on your couch and you're
like having a hard time getting yourself

1362
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:10,550
out of bed.

1363
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,450
Oh my God,

1364
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,370
he's going 70 miles an
hour down this crazy hill

1365
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,160
with horrible music and it
looks like a video game.

1366
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:22,994
Right?

1367
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,391
I mean,

1368
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:27,860
it's just crazy that this kid is
doing this because you can't stop.

1369
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,520
I mean,

1370
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:28,881
actually,

1371
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:29,990
he's really good.

1372
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,250
Yeah.

1373
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,000
So there's a point where he,

1374
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:32,240
uh,

1375
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,600
he turns a skateboard
sideways to slow it down,

1376
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,010
like at the very,

1377
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,550
uh,

1378
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,090
but,

1379
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,570
and there's a couple little wiggles there.

1380
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,790
It looks like he's about to go down.

1381
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,900
And if he goes down,

1382
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,621
dude,

1383
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:44,550
you're breaking everything.

1384
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,180
Oh yeah.

1385
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,770
You're going 70 miles an hour.

1386
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:47,041
I mean,

1387
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,080
he is fall lying.

1388
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,060
There's no way.

1389
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,391
I mean,

1390
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,870
they're not faking this unless
this is some sort of advanced CG.

1391
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,170
No,

1392
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,921
I was going to say,

1393
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:56,191
I mean,

1394
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,900
it almost could be a video game.

1395
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,300
Like watch when he reaches his hands down,

1396
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:03,900
he has some kind of crazy gloves on
and when he reaches his hands down,

1397
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,420
there's certain parts in the video
where he's a touching the sparks,

1398
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,770
sparks the sparks.

1399
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,953
I look at that.

1400
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,370
Jesus fucking Christ,

1401
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:11,790
I cried.

1402
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,623
He almost fell.

1403
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,000
I mean he's getting like
really close to falling.

1404
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:19,080
Like there's a couple times there where
there's like this intense wiggle and

1405
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:21,690
he's talking himself like a,

1406
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:24,320
a speed skater so that he can go faster.

1407
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:24,810
Yeah.

1408
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,770
Crazy fucker.

1409
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,410
Like what is wrong with kids?

1410
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,460
I mean I get it.

1411
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:30,630
This is an adrenaline rush.

1412
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:35,631
But when you see this knowing what
you suffered from standing up under a

1413
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:36,750
cabinet.

1414
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,583
Yeah.

1415
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,430
Yeah.

1416
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,191
And does this freak?

1417
00:36:39,191 --> 00:36:39,330
Yeah.

1418
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,260
Does he have a helmet on?

1419
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,190
Is that a hat?

1420
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,770
That's a helmet.

1421
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,261
It's a helmet.

1422
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,094
Held him.

1423
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,190
Was that how long are going to do well?

1424
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,453
Oh little.

1425
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,530
We get legal.

1426
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:48,960
You this,

1427
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,793
look at that.

1428
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,240
That kid is crazy.

1429
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,090
That's how he slowed down and now he's up.

1430
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,000
He's down to a reasonable pace.

1431
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,141
But when you see him,

1432
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:59,700
he'll do it again to slow it down.

1433
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:01,260
He grabs a board and look at this.

1434
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,750
That is nuts.

1435
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,460
Are you figuring out how many hours have,

1436
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,120
I mean cause he's like a virtuoso at.

1437
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,371
Yeah.

1438
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:10,960
So there's like thousands
and thousands of hours.

1439
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,341
Yeah.

1440
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:12,960
He's put the 10,000 hours in.

1441
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,873
Yeah.

1442
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,300
But good Lord,

1443
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,860
when you see something like that,

1444
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,000
no one what you went through,

1445
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:20,420
like anything like when you
see like dirt bike riders

1446
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,920
doing fine.

1447
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,160
I actually have a really,

1448
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,170
I stopped watching professional football,

1449
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:24,950
um,

1450
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,970
after I used to,

1451
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,923
you know,

1452
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,830
I mean go 40 niners right.

1453
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,140
But,

1454
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,530
uh,

1455
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,363
I can't,

1456
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,860
I can't watch football anymore.

1457
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:34,490
Like I just,

1458
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:34,910
I mean,

1459
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,743
I can,

1460
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,760
but,

1461
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,340
uh,

1462
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,010
I don't enjoy it in
the same way because I,

1463
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,893
I just feel,

1464
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,820
I feel bad players and when I see,

1465
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,350
when I see like a really hard hit,

1466
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,723
I just,

1467
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,170
I just feel bad.

1468
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,273
So

1469
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,580
I think that's something a lot of people
are struggling with these days with all

1470
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:53,180
these,

1471
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,331
you know,

1472
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:57,200
the real sports story that they did on
traumatic brain injury and the issues

1473
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:59,420
that people are having and the,

1474
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,580
all the stuff that I've seen
from fighters over the years is,

1475
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,370
it's definitely affected my enjoyment.

1476
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,290
What's this retiring after
concussion next hit to my head.

1477
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:09,970
Could possibly,

1478
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,803
wow.

1479
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,141
I mean,

1480
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:11,920
this is a thing now,

1481
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,161
right?

1482
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:12,390
Three,

1483
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,820
four,

1484
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,270
yeah.

1485
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:13,601
They're,

1486
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:15,340
they're retiring one,

1487
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:16,720
two years into their career.

1488
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,481
Yeah.

1489
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:17,870
Well,

1490
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,320
there's more of that now than ever before
because guys are realizing first of

1491
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:21,950
all,

1492
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,880
at the end of,

1493
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,723
uh,

1494
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,370
at the end of their career,

1495
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,610
they're most likely
going to be debilitated.

1496
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:28,840
Yeah.

1497
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,061
I mean,

1498
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:33,800
almost all of the players that take a
lot of hits suffer from serious injuries

1499
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:34,910
for the rest of their lives.

1500
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:35,440
Yeah.

1501
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,240
And so when you're young and
you're looking at your future,

1502
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:37,601
go and look,

1503
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:40,600
I could put all my energy
into this and you know,

1504
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,920
be a mess.

1505
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,000
Or I can say,

1506
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:43,480
you know what,

1507
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,350
I'm still young.

1508
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,460
I'm 23.

1509
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,810
I could do anything I want.

1510
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:47,021
Like,

1511
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:47,201
look,

1512
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,400
I've been in the NFL,

1513
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:48,820
I've,

1514
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,780
I've experienced it.

1515
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,250
Let me just get the fuck out of here.

1516
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,760
Yeah.

1517
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,593
Go try something else.

1518
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,230
She worried that the future
of the sport is going,

1519
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,780
there's going to be a
big socioeconomic divide.

1520
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:59,040
We're the only people who,

1521
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,460
who really want to play and are willing
to take that risk are people who feel

1522
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:03,630
like they have nothing to lose.

1523
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:04,464
You know,

1524
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:04,800
um,

1525
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,740
we just stat and there's the
people that want to watch it.

1526
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:08,381
Like we,

1527
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:10,080
we've experienced that with the UFC too.

1528
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,273
There's a,

1529
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,310
there's a bunch of people
that want to watch the,

1530
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,390
the head injuries that just,

1531
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,830
they don't know what they're seeing yet.

1532
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,150
They don't understand.

1533
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,313
Like when you,

1534
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,990
you watch somebody get
kol like really badly,

1535
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:24,930
when you see someone get head kicked or
no dropped in their head or something

1536
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:25,590
like that,

1537
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:25,861
you,

1538
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:26,910
you just see excitement.

1539
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,420
He still like,

1540
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:27,541
oh,

1541
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:28,500
that guy just beat that guy.

1542
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,780
Yeah,

1543
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,410
yeah,

1544
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:29,880
yeah.

1545
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,091
No,

1546
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:30,391
I know.

1547
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:30,620
And I,

1548
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,200
it's,

1549
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,033
uh,

1550
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:33,511
yeah,

1551
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:34,170
I can't watch,

1552
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,280
I can't watch fights either for the same
reason when I have friends who are so

1553
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:39,210
into it and,

1554
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:39,451
you know,

1555
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:40,284
you just,

1556
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,180
because I mean so,

1557
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:42,390
right.

1558
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,200
I Love Games.

1559
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,370
I understand a good game.

1560
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:44,600
Good,

1561
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,380
good sport is a good game.

1562
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,190
Um,

1563
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,023
and,

1564
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,571
uh,

1565
00:39:48,571 --> 00:39:53,520
you admire people's ability
to be so good at this.

1566
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,060
You know,

1567
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,880
this thing that we've created
to test human potential.

1568
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,750
But,

1569
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,583
um,

1570
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,573
but you know,

1571
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:05,070
if I've sort of started drifting to
sports where there's fewer concussions,

1572
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:05,281
although,

1573
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:05,491
you know,

1574
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:09,780
like I'm a big tennis fan and one of
the big stars just got a concussion this

1575
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,710
weekend at the u s open,

1576
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,320
so she slipped,

1577
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,160
uh,

1578
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,790
in the,

1579
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,360
in like the locker room after
doing like the ice bath after like,

1580
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,243
uh,

1581
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,430
um,

1582
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:20,821
and,

1583
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:21,090
uh,

1584
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,570
it's interesting they showed her coming
to the courts to see if she could

1585
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:27,900
practice with her sunglasses on the
hoodie pulled up and she just has that,

1586
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,450
that look that like now I saw her,

1587
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:30,810
I was like,

1588
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,471
oh my God.

1589
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:31,711
I mean,

1590
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:36,150
she's like right in that zone of where
she thinks she's going to play because

1591
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:37,800
she's not thinking clearly,

1592
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,760
but you can see her.

1593
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:39,001
I mean,

1594
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,980
she's like a shell of herself.

1595
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,780
Um,

1596
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,100
so when you see something like that,

1597
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:43,791
do you want to reach out?

1598
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:44,240
Yeah.

1599
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,841
Oh yeah.

1600
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:45,171
No,

1601
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:45,441
I know.

1602
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:47,690
And people have been
tweeting at her to be like,

1603
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:49,130
you have to get super better,

1604
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:49,930
you know,

1605
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,070
finish their clinical trial.

1606
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:51,904
You could,

1607
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,120
I know,

1608
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,831
be better,

1609
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:54,830
but what is super better,

1610
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:55,410
right.

1611
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,243
Yeah.

1612
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,050
Uh,

1613
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,731
I do,

1614
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:58,240
I do,

1615
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,740
I do want to reach out because,

1616
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,250
um,

1617
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,990
because I know how hard it was and how,

1618
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,240
how so few people,

1619
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,133
I mean just the,

1620
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,700
the general public conversation about
this is not caught up to kind of the

1621
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,430
reality of what people experience

1622
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,241
well that uh,

1623
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:14,260
those ice baths,

1624
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,200
that's a,

1625
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:16,330
one of the problems with that,

1626
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,350
that form of cold therapy is that
you get out in your legs like rubber.

1627
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,170
Yes.

1628
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:21,900
You're,

1629
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,960
everything's not working so good.

1630
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,600
That's why you can't do that
stuff and then work out.

1631
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,021
Right.

1632
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:26,170
You know,

1633
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,680
to some forms of cold therapy that you
can do and you can work out after it,

1634
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:30,910
but not those ice pass.

1635
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,160
I have done,

1636
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,240
I run marathons.

1637
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,530
I have done some ice bath and I've,

1638
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,440
yeah,

1639
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,570
I,

1640
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,780
have you ever done the
whole body cryotherapy?

1641
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,320
We stepped in the chamber and you go
to 250 degrees below zero for three

1642
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:43,070
minutes.

1643
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,903
It's awesome.

1644
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,460
Oh,

1645
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,610
it's the best body element.

1646
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:47,480
Like do you kind of,

1647
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,140
is there like a mental
state that is changed?

1648
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:51,851
Oh yeah.

1649
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:52,001
Well,

1650
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:53,920
your brain produces
something called neoprene,

1651
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:54,754
Nefron,

1652
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,740
cold shock proteins and
all these different things
happen when you hit minus one

1653
00:41:59,741 --> 00:42:01,210
50 degrees below zero.

1654
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,733
Yeah.

1655
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,521
It's,

1656
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,800
there's also the something
that someone just invented,

1657
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,000
one of the reserve brought this up,

1658
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,800
something called a cryo helmet.

1659
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,780
Like you put it on over your head.

1660
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,000
It's like a gel pack thing.

1661
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:13,421
Like a,

1662
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:17,300
it's almost like a Hoodie and
you put it on and it's like they,

1663
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,320
they really recommend it for
people that have had head injuries,

1664
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,080
sort of reduction in swelling.

1665
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,531
Right.

1666
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:23,800
I could,

1667
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,230
I mean I could see that if you're
trying to treat the inflammation.

1668
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,351
Yeah.

1669
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:27,970
Because it's like a whole thing.

1670
00:42:27,971 --> 00:42:29,800
Like I got like a frozen helmet,

1671
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,051
you know,

1672
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:31,180
he goes a little gel packs.

1673
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,350
I took one of those.

1674
00:42:32,351 --> 00:42:33,970
But it's a helmet on your head.

1675
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,880
I will of course I'm going to say no.

1676
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,130
You got to pull up like
Google scholar though.

1677
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,023
For me,

1678
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,090
I want to see like is there
any literature on this yet?

1679
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,960
Um,

1680
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,400
cause I'm,

1681
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,410
so I'm like hold up.

1682
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,653
I don't pull it.

1683
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,170
I'm fairly conservative with
telling other people what to do.

1684
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,430
Like for myself,

1685
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:51,880
you know,

1686
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,330
I was like,

1687
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:52,511
oh,

1688
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:53,344
I'll make a game.

1689
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,000
But for telling other people to do,

1690
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:55,480
I'm like,

1691
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,540
wait until there's a peer
reviewed paper for sure.

1692
00:42:59,110 --> 00:42:59,801
But fighters,

1693
00:42:59,801 --> 00:42:59,981
you know,

1694
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:03,190
bas Rutten who's a former
UFC heavyweight champion,

1695
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,050
great fighter was talking about that.

1696
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,600
That's a,

1697
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,311
that's important.

1698
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:09,920
Like when guys get hit to ice
their head after it's over,

1699
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,530
and he in his rationale was like,

1700
00:43:11,531 --> 00:43:11,681
look,

1701
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:12,401
if you hurt your knee,

1702
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:13,240
what's the first thing they do?

1703
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:13,901
They put ice on it.

1704
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:14,980
Why don't you put ice on your head?

1705
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:15,761
I was like,

1706
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,470
that actually makes a lot of sense.

1707
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:17,860
Yeah,

1708
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,050
I know,

1709
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,671
that's really interesting.

1710
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:20,080
I was just reading about,

1711
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,213
you know,

1712
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,240
you probably know this,

1713
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:24,700
they say like five minutes
after you stopped breathing,

1714
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,770
supposedly you have like brain cell death.

1715
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,180
Have you heard this?

1716
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,830
If somebody who's drowned and you
can't get them breathing again in five

1717
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:30,360
minutes,

1718
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,193
um,

1719
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,240
then supposedly it's too late and they're
now finding that if you cool down the

1720
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:39,310
body and the brain that
they can come back.

1721
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,620
You can be not breathing,

1722
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:42,370
not,

1723
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,120
you know,

1724
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,810
heart,

1725
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,240
heart beating for more than five minutes.

1726
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,580
Now if you get the body
temperature so enough,

1727
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,443
pack them with ice.

1728
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,160
That's what they're doing now
they're starting to do that.

1729
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:51,980
It's like a first,

1730
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,813
uh,

1731
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,011
I know,

1732
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:54,371
and I was like,

1733
00:43:54,371 --> 00:43:55,121
I was just telling my husband,

1734
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:55,361
I'm like,

1735
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:56,080
we need to,

1736
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,190
we need you to read this literature.

1737
00:43:57,191 --> 00:44:00,340
So cause I want to know if I'm supposed
to do this or wait until like the EMT

1738
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:00,820
shows how,

1739
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,810
like if something happens,

1740
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:04,570
should I start packing ice or,

1741
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,240
yeah.

1742
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,073
I'm not sure.

1743
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,960
Uh,

1744
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,030
I'm not actually sure if the
practical implications of this.

1745
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,370
As you get older you realize more and
more hell damn vulnerable people are so

1746
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:16,630
physically vulnerable.

1747
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,110
Yes.

1748
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,550
Well this is really
interesting because you know,

1749
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:19,384
I,

1750
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,860
in doing what I do,

1751
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,420
I have confronted a lot of
skepticism and I would even say,

1752
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,150
I mean people who are
really quite sarcastic,

1753
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,140
but they hear about this,

1754
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:29,741
Oh,

1755
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:31,240
I'm going to adopt a secret identity.

1756
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,000
It's going to make me not depressed.

1757
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,540
You know,

1758
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,080
usually it's people not suffering
from depression who say this.

1759
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:39,510
Cause if you're really suffering
from something debilitating,

1760
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,350
like clinical depression,

1761
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:41,100
you will try anything.

1762
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,990
So the people who are pretty
happy and healthy and they'll,

1763
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,340
they'll say this,

1764
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:46,260
it sounds ridiculous.

1765
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,130
Um,

1766
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,640
but,

1767
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,200
but you're talking about bloggers,

1768
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,063
right?

1769
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:50,740
Yeah,

1770
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:50,930
it's,

1771
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:51,300
well,

1772
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:51,541
yeah.

1773
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:54,480
And The New Yorker just
ran a big giant piece,

1774
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:54,930
uh,

1775
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,470
about,

1776
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,520
about super better,

1777
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,593
um,

1778
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,523
uh,

1779
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,400
sort of,

1780
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,233
you know,

1781
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,650
it was both positive but also like
still this sounds kind of ridiculous.

1782
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,500
Well it does sound ridiculous,

1783
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,590
but then it's like,

1784
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:07,771
oh,

1785
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,330
can work and sound ridiculous.

1786
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,171
Exactly.

1787
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:10,860
And that's why it's like,

1788
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,610
I,

1789
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,150
I,

1790
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,720
uh,

1791
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,720
when you realize how vulnerable people
are and how much is out of our control,

1792
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,810
I mean those are the people who are
the first in line to try this and who

1793
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:22,530
benefit the most.

1794
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,980
So we had half a million people
play an electronic version,

1795
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:29,400
like logging their power ups and they're
bad guys and quest so that I could get

1796
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:32,310
data on it and see what are
the most effective power ups.

1797
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:33,660
Like how often do you have to,

1798
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,111
you know,

1799
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:34,950
check in to,

1800
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,803
to get better.

1801
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,950
And we found that people with the,

1802
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:42,240
which is the most painful and difficult
situations where the ones that were

1803
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,890
benefiting the most,

1804
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:46,440
it's like sort of the more you
realize how vulnerable you are,

1805
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,580
the more open you are and the
more this kind of concrete,

1806
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:51,781
purposeful,

1807
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:55,410
positive action can actually
make a big difference.

1808
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,870
That makes sense.

1809
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,141
I mean,

1810
00:45:57,141 --> 00:45:59,370
once you feel the vulnerability you,

1811
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,030
you,

1812
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:00,863
cause it'd be,

1813
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,450
it becomes real.

1814
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,180
Whereas when you look at someone
who has a broken leg and you go,

1815
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:06,620
oh,

1816
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:11,030
I can intellectually understand
that that person broke their leg,

1817
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,190
but I don't know what it feels like.

1818
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,020
Right.

1819
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,240
You know,

1820
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,380
if you've never broken your leg,

1821
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:16,370
you don't know that feeling.

1822
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:16,670
You're like,

1823
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:17,000
ah,

1824
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,481
fuck,

1825
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:19,160
I can't even stand on this stupid thing.

1826
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:20,090
Is that,

1827
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,170
that feeling where like,

1828
00:46:21,171 --> 00:46:21,411
okay,

1829
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:21,841
now what?

1830
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:22,670
What do I have to do?

1831
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:23,271
What do I have to do?

1832
00:46:23,271 --> 00:46:23,871
Tom would have to do,

1833
00:46:23,871 --> 00:46:25,280
and then the reality changes.

1834
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:25,671
Yeah.

1835
00:46:25,671 --> 00:46:30,671
And the reality of you having that head
trauma and trying to figure out like,

1836
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:33,560
there's gotta be a way
to get out of the swamp,

1837
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,150
this mental swamp.

1838
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,510
And I'm stuck in a let's
fucking make a game.

1839
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,250
Like let's do it.

1840
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,083
You like you're just,

1841
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,151
I mean,

1842
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,110
it makes sense to me.

1843
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:45,980
It be a person has been through a bunch
of surgeries and injuries and stuff.

1844
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:50,320
It totally makes sense to me because
there's a reality that every time I've

1845
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,650
really badly injured myself,

1846
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:53,200
like where I needed knee
surgery or something,

1847
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:54,034
there's like a,

1848
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,000
just an acceptance just goes,

1849
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:56,240
Huh,

1850
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,073
let's just go do it.

1851
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,120
Let's go do it because
now this thing's broken.

1852
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,950
And until that happens,

1853
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:01,850
there's a bunch of people will tell you,

1854
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:02,140
well,

1855
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,380
once you try rehabbing it,

1856
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,580
why don't you try doing this?

1857
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:04,731
Like,

1858
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:05,150
no,

1859
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:05,960
it's like,

1860
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,920
I don't think you get it.

1861
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:07,340
No.

1862
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,920
And a lot of times you'll have an
injury and you won't know if it will get

1863
00:47:09,921 --> 00:47:10,670
better.

1864
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,260
Um,

1865
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,180
W W if you'll be able to get back
to what you were doing before,

1866
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:18,800
which is actually where the name super
better comes from because I wasn't sure I

1867
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:22,190
would ever have the same
cognitive capabilities I had.

1868
00:47:22,191 --> 00:47:22,401
And I,

1869
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:22,821
at that time,

1870
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:23,320
I was using,

1871
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:23,481
you know,

1872
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:24,230
I was,

1873
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:24,410
you know,

1874
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:25,730
I had just gotten my phd,

1875
00:47:25,731 --> 00:47:26,930
I was doing research.

1876
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:27,470
I was,

1877
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,303
you know,

1878
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:32,650
I was to being able to have
an intellectual profession.

1879
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,610
Um,

1880
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,270
and so I,

1881
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:34,781
everyone's like,

1882
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:35,680
get better soon.

1883
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:36,430
And I'm like,

1884
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:36,910
well,

1885
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:37,541
what does that mean?

1886
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:41,440
That means get back to who
you were before this happened.

1887
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,700
And I didn't know if I would ever
be able to do any of that again.

1888
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:46,091
So I thought,

1889
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:46,181
well,

1890
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:47,020
I'm not going to get better.

1891
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,070
I'm going to get super better.

1892
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:48,940
I'll just be different.

1893
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,060
I'll be like this new
super version of myself,

1894
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:53,200
like Spiderman.

1895
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:53,441
Uh,

1896
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:53,741
you know,

1897
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:56,680
he got bit by the radioactive
spider and this concussions,

1898
00:47:56,681 --> 00:47:57,790
my radioactive spider,

1899
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,080
and I don't know who I'm going to be,

1900
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,060
but it'll be someone different.

1901
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,811
And,

1902
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:02,141
uh,

1903
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:03,730
and instead of just trying to,

1904
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,440
you know,

1905
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,700
because anytime you're having
an injury or an illness,

1906
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,430
you don't know who you're
going to be at the end of it.

1907
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,050
He might be back to normal.

1908
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:14,440
It might be different and you want it to
be the best different that it could be.

1909
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:14,891
Yeah.

1910
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:18,340
There's been many stories of people that
have gotten knocked in the head and all

1911
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:21,430
of a sudden had musical
house mathematical talent.

1912
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:21,630
Yeah.

1913
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,840
What are you hoping that that was going to

1914
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,000
the weirdest experience?

1915
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,870
Um,

1916
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,260
so I'm a very introverted
person by nature.

1917
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,130
I,

1918
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:30,963
you know,

1919
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,590
like if my phone rings,

1920
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:33,401
I won't answer it.

1921
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:35,530
Like even if you're my
friend or like your mind mom,

1922
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:35,951
like,

1923
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:36,041
oh,

1924
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,270
it's too much social interaction.

1925
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:38,021
Like I get anxiety,

1926
00:48:38,021 --> 00:48:38,854
I can't answer it.

1927
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:39,760
So,

1928
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,570
uh,

1929
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:41,740
that's been like my whole life.

1930
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,550
But,

1931
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,270
um,

1932
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,650
we,

1933
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,321
what we know about,

1934
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,060
like the difference between
introverts and extroverts,

1935
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,960
introverts tend to stimulate
themselves with internal thinking.

1936
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,440
They're always,

1937
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,820
they're always thinking and they don't
need other people to kind of get them

1938
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:55,654
excited.

1939
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,590
Extroverts respond much more
positively to external stimulation.

1940
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,553
It's like a,

1941
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,620
it's like they're just primed.

1942
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,330
If they see someone smiling at them,

1943
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:05,470
it's like a cocaine hit,

1944
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,280
you know.

1945
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,590
So when I had the injury I
couldn't think to myself anymore.

1946
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,640
I couldn't like entertain
myself with my own thoughts.

1947
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,700
And I became like this super extroverted
person and I started like calling

1948
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:19,180
everybody in my phone,

1949
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:22,120
like contact lists in
which people I would never,

1950
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,190
I mean we wouldn't even pick
up the phone and I'm like,

1951
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,380
please talk to me cause I couldn't,

1952
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,020
I couldn't literally cannot
be an introvert anymore.

1953
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,860
But that only lasted for like a couple
months and then my surgeon to get better.

1954
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,070
I went back to being
introverted and I still,

1955
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,300
today I,

1956
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,170
I try to keep some of that
because I actually discovered,

1957
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:42,030
wait,

1958
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:42,330
I,

1959
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,330
I really like,

1960
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:44,410
it's nice to talk to people.

1961
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,170
He does not actually a burden,

1962
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,080
you know,

1963
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,290
but,

1964
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:48,850
but that's,

1965
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:49,390
so that was,

1966
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:49,960
that was,

1967
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,880
that was one of the sort of super better,

1968
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,510
you know,

1969
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,650
changes for me is I realize and they were,

1970
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,090
you know,

1971
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,830
we know from psychological literature,

1972
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,170
extroverts really are happier.

1973
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,250
They live longer,

1974
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,510
they're psychologically healthier.

1975
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,080
It is,

1976
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,660
if you can convince yourself to be social,

1977
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,380
it's,

1978
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,370
it's really good for you.

1979
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,000
Um,

1980
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,830
the introverts just so have
a different brain chemistry.

1981
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:09,950
So their brains telling them,

1982
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:10,660
yeah,

1983
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,160
two people scary.

1984
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:12,520
Like,

1985
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,851
you know,

1986
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:13,840
too much stimulation.

1987
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,441
Uh,

1988
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:15,100
yeah.

1989
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,790
Well that's the,

1990
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:18,790
one of the weirdest things
about online interaction is it,

1991
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:23,791
it's kind of a combination of both
introvert behavior and extrovert bay.

1992
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,200
Cause even though you are
interacting with people,

1993
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:27,530
you're not seeing no,

1994
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:28,370
it's controlled

1995
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:28,960
and that's,

1996
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,390
it's,

1997
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,350
it's the face to face
can be really a daunting.

1998
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,520
Yeah.

1999
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah.

2000
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,781
Like you'd like the,

2001
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:36,614
just the,

2002
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,810
the energy that it takes.

2003
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,710
Yeah.

2004
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,161
I mean it's not,

2005
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,480
it's not the same thing as being,

2006
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,140
I mean,

2007
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,640
just cause you're introvert
doesn't mean you're,

2008
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,420
I dunno,

2009
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,100
like socially unable.

2010
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:46,490
Like,

2011
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:46,850
you know,

2012
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,240
you're not,

2013
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,080
you're not a misfit.

2014
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,391
Well,

2015
00:50:48,391 --> 00:50:49,170
obviously you,

2016
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,200
you're very capable of keeping
a regular conversation going.

2017
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,453
Yes.

2018
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,091
I mean,

2019
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:54,760
you're done.

2020
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,700
Then you can say you're an introvert,

2021
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:57,900
but you're easily,

2022
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,321
you know,

2023
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:58,850
you're easy.

2024
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:59,091
You,

2025
00:50:59,091 --> 00:50:59,281
you're,

2026
00:50:59,281 --> 00:50:59,611
you're like,

2027
00:50:59,611 --> 00:51:00,271
you're just talking.

2028
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:00,931
No problems.

2029
00:51:00,931 --> 00:51:01,490
You're not,

2030
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:01,680
yeah.

2031
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,690
I've had some introverts
on this podcast before,

2032
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:05,010
and then it's obvious.

2033
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:05,850
They're like,

2034
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,800
everything's an effort.

2035
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,610
Yeah,

2036
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,240
yeah.

2037
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,460
It's probably more of an
effort for me than it looks.

2038
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,380
Hmm.

2039
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,660
But I think it's more of an effort
for everybody then it looks,

2040
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,770
maybe that's a good point.

2041
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,663
Yeah.

2042
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,270
I think that I'm just,

2043
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,400
one of the issues with online interaction
is that you don't see the people and

2044
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:22,810
you know,

2045
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:23,021
you know,

2046
00:51:23,021 --> 00:51:23,380
you just,

2047
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,213
it's just like,

2048
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,220
my intention is it's kind of ambiguous.

2049
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:27,731
You know,

2050
00:51:27,731 --> 00:51:31,060
like you're write something or you
put something out there and it's a,

2051
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:32,500
it's not completely clear.

2052
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:34,300
Like if you say something,

2053
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:35,830
I get the tone.

2054
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,840
I can tell if you're being sarcastic.

2055
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:38,920
And I,

2056
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,250
if,

2057
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:39,440
uh,

2058
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:39,941
if someone,

2059
00:51:39,941 --> 00:51:41,260
if you say something mean to me,

2060
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:42,430
like we have to look at each other,

2061
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:42,671
I'm like,

2062
00:51:42,671 --> 00:51:43,504
fucking really?

2063
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:43,860
Yeah.

2064
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,550
Like in this weird thing to it.

2065
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,620
Whereas if you do that online,

2066
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:48,640
there's like none of that.

2067
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:48,910
Yeah.

2068
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,500
I think that there's,

2069
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:55,420
there's something very strange that's
going on in our culture right now with so

2070
00:51:55,421 --> 00:52:00,310
many people spending a giant amount of
their time only interacting with people

2071
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,150
through text.

2072
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,980
Absolutely.

2073
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,510
Well that's one of the areas of
research that I was diving into.

2074
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:06,721
So,

2075
00:52:06,721 --> 00:52:06,901
you know,

2076
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:09,330
cause I don't just know
research brain injury stuff,

2077
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:14,331
I typically research video games and how
they change how we feel and think and

2078
00:52:14,671 --> 00:52:14,941
act.

2079
00:52:14,941 --> 00:52:16,440
And what does that mean you're punched in?

2080
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,260
The field is called performance studies.

2081
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,730
So I was just basically
studying how people perform,

2082
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:24,810
um,

2083
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,730
in video games and as a
result of video games,

2084
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:28,860
sort of collaboration skills,

2085
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:30,810
they're sort of psychological performance,

2086
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:31,620
um,

2087
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,440
things like that.

2088
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:32,700
At,

2089
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,100
at Uc Berkeley it was where I studied.

2090
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:36,263
And uh,

2091
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,760
so one of the things that we know
that's happening in video games is that

2092
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:41,550
there's a really big difference between
playing a video game in the same room

2093
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:44,370
with somebody and playing online.

2094
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,930
And so like if we're playing call of
duty and I'm trying to kill you and if

2095
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:50,250
we're playing in the same room,

2096
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,090
we actually undergo really great,

2097
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:54,900
uh,

2098
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,380
it was kind of,

2099
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,640
they call it synchronization.

2100
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:57,750
So our heart rates,

2101
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:59,850
we'll sync up our breathing rates,

2102
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,690
sing GAAP,

2103
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,740
we get it's kind of mirror
neuron in process going on
where it's like blood flow

2104
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:06,900
is mirroring where it's flowing.

2105
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,960
The patterns of activation are
mirroring each other and all of that is

2106
00:53:09,961 --> 00:53:12,450
associated with more compassion,

2107
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:13,171
more empathy.

2108
00:53:13,171 --> 00:53:14,010
We like each other more.

2109
00:53:14,011 --> 00:53:14,970
We trust each other more,

2110
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,410
even if the game is violent,

2111
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,550
even if we're competing.

2112
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,360
Um,

2113
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,010
all of this happens
and it happens because,

2114
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,221
you know,

2115
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:22,380
when you were playing a game
with or against someone,

2116
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:24,900
you have to try to get in their brain
like what are they going to do next?

2117
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:25,411
What's next?

2118
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,060
Move.

2119
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,390
Um,

2120
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,430
and so your brain starts to mirror
what you think they're doing.

2121
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,040
So it's this,

2122
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,040
it's this really intense mind
body mirroring that goes on.

2123
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,000
What triggers the mirroring,

2124
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,760
the observance of the
character on the screen?

2125
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,580
Uh,

2126
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:40,941
well,

2127
00:53:40,941 --> 00:53:41,211
no,

2128
00:53:41,211 --> 00:53:41,760
it's,

2129
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,140
it's because it only works
if you're in the same space,

2130
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,200
physical space with them,

2131
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,120
but you're still looking at a screen.

2132
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,811
Yeah.

2133
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,330
Well you're trying to
think what are they doing?

2134
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,370
And there just something
about if you're the,

2135
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,480
you may think you're
looking at the screen,

2136
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,300
but there's also a general awareness,

2137
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,860
like when you're sitting next to someone,

2138
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,580
right,

2139
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,000
you're aware of sort of
what's going on and the,

2140
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:06,350
and cues that you're picking up,

2141
00:54:06,351 --> 00:54:07,520
body language cues.

2142
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:09,330
And if you'd like turn to look at them,

2143
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,120
you'll even just in a split second,

2144
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:13,190
you'll get this sort of
facial expression queue.

2145
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,413
Um,

2146
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,970
and that doesn't happen in online games.

2147
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,390
Um,

2148
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,830
so what we've just been measured.

2149
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:19,431
Oh yeah,

2150
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:19,581
yeah,

2151
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:20,090
yeah.

2152
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,500
So what we've seen is if you
take the same game and play it,

2153
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:24,950
you know,

2154
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,120
against somebody in the room,

2155
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,430
you wind up with these positive impacts,

2156
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,090
uh,

2157
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:29,790
like,

2158
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,020
you know,

2159
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:30,741
more compassion,

2160
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:31,520
more empathy.

2161
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,510
You like each other more.

2162
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,250
If you play the same game online,

2163
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,710
you're not able to see
their facial expression.

2164
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,810
You're not able to get the same,

2165
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:39,980
uh,

2166
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,510
sinking phenomenon.

2167
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,910
You actually dehumanize the opponent,

2168
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,930
you,

2169
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,250
your testosterone goes up,

2170
00:54:46,251 --> 00:54:48,350
you feel less empathy towards them.

2171
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,070
Um,

2172
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,150
and so it's one of the reasons
why in the book I talk about how,

2173
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:53,521
you know,

2174
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:57,410
unless you're actively trying to change
your personality to be more aggressive

2175
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,040
and you want to,

2176
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,431
I don't know,

2177
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:01,830
for some reason you feel like you
want to be kind of more of a have,

2178
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:02,960
it's like aggressive,

2179
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,520
hostile personality.

2180
00:55:04,521 --> 00:55:04,701
A,

2181
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:09,701
you should not spend more than half your
time trying to beat strangers online

2182
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,053
because of the,

2183
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,440
because it's just not

2184
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,793
after times,

2185
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,730
a lot of time,

2186
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,140
half your half your gaming time.

2187
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,180
Oh Jesus Christ.

2188
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,290
What are you recommending?

2189
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,430
24 hours in a day?

2190
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:21,900
No more than 12 hours.

2191
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:22,943
Killing strangers.

2192
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,421
And it actually,

2193
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:23,610
yeah,

2194
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,610
21 hours a week is where you start to
see the benefits of games reduce and

2195
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:30,120
negative impacts increase.

2196
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:31,740
So there's another public
service announcement.

2197
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:32,340
Um,

2198
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,173
what have you,

2199
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,820
have you done it in layers where you know,

2200
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:38,340
you like I used to do a land parties.

2201
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,920
My friends used to play quake lan parties.

2202
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,640
Um,

2203
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,600
and it's really fun.

2204
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:42,791
You know,

2205
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:43,920
there's a lot of camaraderie and stuff.

2206
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:44,370
Yeah.

2207
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,710
But if you put a barrier up,

2208
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,040
yeah.

2209
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,030
But during the same room or if they're
in a room that's right next door,

2210
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:54,420
but you know they're there and may be
can hear their voice or if you shut that

2211
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:55,530
door and you can't hear their voice,

2212
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,850
have you changed?

2213
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,710
Have they seen like what,

2214
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,000
what if the mirroring is consistent?

2215
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,530
Yeah.

2216
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,820
I'm the studies that I've seen show that
you have to be in physical proximity.

2217
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:09,480
So if there was a barrier
and we were unable,

2218
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:12,840
I was unable to look over and get those
cues from your body language or from

2219
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:16,140
your facial expression
that it would not happen.

2220
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:18,480
How'd your cubicle thing and
I can just like reach up.

2221
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:19,060
Yeah,

2222
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,230
yeah,

2223
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:19,651
yeah.

2224
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:20,011
Then you,

2225
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:21,120
then you probably would,

2226
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,840
I like,

2227
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,150
I liked this idea of this aging.

2228
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,460
The thing I'm really curious about is
with twitch and now youtube gaming is if

2229
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:29,860
you can watch somebody playing and,

2230
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,750
and now you're seeing their face,

2231
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:32,650
um,

2232
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,870
while they're playing a game.

2233
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:35,770
Um,

2234
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,730
studies have shown that watching someone
play a game that you know how to play

2235
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,060
will trigger the same mirror neurons
because your brain can kind of emulate,

2236
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:43,870
uh,

2237
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:44,591
if you're playing a game,

2238
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:45,490
I don't know how to play.

2239
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,420
I don't know if the controls,

2240
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:47,254
I don't know the goals.

2241
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,340
My brain will just be like,

2242
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:49,990
I don't know.

2243
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,320
Right.

2244
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,160
If I know how to play the game,

2245
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:51,340
like,

2246
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:51,820
oh,

2247
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,050
I know what she's trying to do.

2248
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:54,200
I know what a strategist.

2249
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,740
Yeah.

2250
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,330
Whatever it is,

2251
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,710
everybody knows what to do,

2252
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,460
can away from the ghost.

2253
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:57,641
Yeah.

2254
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:58,060
Yeah.

2255
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,870
So one thing I'm interested in
is if I can see someone's face,

2256
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,530
you know,

2257
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:03,363
while they're playing the game,

2258
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,001
they're playing a game.

2259
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:04,600
I know,

2260
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,860
could you get some of the benefits,

2261
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:10,420
but it would only be uni directional
because if you're like live streaming your

2262
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:10,780
game plan,

2263
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,613
you can't see me.

2264
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,390
So,

2265
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:12,880
uh,

2266
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,020
but it would be interesting since we
know that if you get this mirror neuron a

2267
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:16,740
fact,

2268
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,260
um,

2269
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,350
it makes people want to help each
other more like each other more.

2270
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:22,360
I'm like thinking like being a powerful,

2271
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,260
you know,

2272
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,260
twitch streamer or youtube game streamer
like could make you really cultivate a

2273
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:31,930
large community of people
who really want to help you,

2274
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,980
which put seems like,

2275
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,820
like if I were building an empire
of like a new kind of community,

2276
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:40,390
I feel like that would be what I would
be building because they would be really,

2277
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,380
um,

2278
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,150
it would be like a really tight bond,

2279
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,770
you know?

2280
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:44,940
That's fascinating.

2281
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:45,751
You know,

2282
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:48,930
this twitch thing has caught a lot of
people by surprise because I think a lot,

2283
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:53,130
no one would have ever thought that it
would be so popular to watch someone play

2284
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:53,860
video games.

2285
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,190
Right.

2286
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:57,970
And the mirror neuron thing helps explain
it because it's not like watching TV

2287
00:57:57,971 --> 00:57:59,080
where it's just passive.

2288
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,730
If you know how to play the game,

2289
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:05,970
your brain starts working to sort
of process it and anticipate,

2290
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:06,461
you know,

2291
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:07,510
what they're gonna do next.

2292
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,830
Trying to figure out what has,

2293
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,260
what decision lawmaker
or where they'll go.

2294
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,280
Um,

2295
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,330
and so you're actually getting a lot
of the same stimulation as if you were

2296
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:17,170
playing the game yourself.

2297
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:18,640
And that's the thing
people don't understand.

2298
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:19,290
Um,

2299
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,920
we see this with musicians too.

2300
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,760
If you know how to play a
musical instrument and you
watch somebody playing that

2301
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:25,780
same musical instrument,

2302
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,730
your brain starts to,

2303
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,983
you know,

2304
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,390
activate as if you are
playing it yourself,

2305
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,430
which is why it can be
more interesting for,

2306
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,791
you know,

2307
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:34,990
somebody knows how to play the piano,

2308
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:38,080
to watch someone else play the piano or
listen to someone else play the piano

2309
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,550
versus somebody who doesn't know.

2310
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,840
That totally makes sense.

2311
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,411
When a,

2312
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:42,280
I used to play quake,

2313
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:43,640
we used to watch these uh,

2314
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,523
things.

2315
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:44,780
Uh,

2316
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,031
they were,

2317
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:48,640
they call them demos and what it was
was a game that they would record.

2318
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:48,910
Yeah.

2319
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,760
And so you'd see it
through a player's eye,

2320
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:55,360
so you get to see how good a player
moves and then it would make you play

2321
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:55,780
better.

2322
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,240
You would do,

2323
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,820
would play better after you saw that.

2324
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:58,683
Absolutely.

2325
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,081
Yeah.

2326
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,280
They were really popular.

2327
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:01,930
Like demos were super popular.

2328
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:05,410
You would download them and you would
play them in game like in your game.

2329
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:05,770
Yeah,

2330
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:06,520
I remember that.

2331
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,270
Yeah.

2332
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,950
Do you remember that?

2333
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:08,380
Yeah.

2334
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,970
I was like into counter
strike a little bit.

2335
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,670
Well that's the case with athletics too.

2336
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:13,090
Um,

2337
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,660
a lot of people tell me that when they
watch like a really good basketball

2338
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:19,180
player play that it makes
them play better basketball.

2339
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:19,420
Yep.

2340
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,890
I know it's the case with pool.

2341
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,710
I played pool and when I watch
really good players play,

2342
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:28,250
like I can kind of emulate what they do.

2343
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,790
But if I feel like it's
not just like copying,

2344
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,500
but I kind of tune in.

2345
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,021
Oh yeah,

2346
00:59:34,021 --> 00:59:34,390
they're good

2347
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,770
because your brain is practicing it.

2348
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:36,080
I,

2349
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,220
I find that after a grand slam in tennis,

2350
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,280
it was because I'll watch me only reason
why I'm not watching tennis right now

2351
00:59:42,281 --> 00:59:43,990
is because we're here doing this.

2352
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:45,100
I like something going on.

2353
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,180
I had the u s open,

2354
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:50,770
my favorite player is playing
like literally right now
in your player Joe Willie

2355
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,090
Tsonga who I named my puppy after.

2356
00:59:52,091 --> 00:59:55,390
I have a dog named the Songa if
he's playing right now to get,

2357
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,920
get to the semis.

2358
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:57,730
Um,

2359
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,980
but no spoilers because I'm recording it.

2360
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:00,670
Um,

2361
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,510
but I know that,

2362
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,360
so I'll go like two weeks watching
hours and hours of tennis a day.

2363
01:00:04,361 --> 01:00:06,680
Then I go to play tennis and I'm better.

2364
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,810
I'm absolutely,

2365
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:08,380
I,

2366
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,400
I see the ball better,

2367
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:10,570
I get to it better.

2368
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,420
Um,

2369
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,390
I'm absolutely,

2370
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:12,590
She,

2371
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:16,060
because my brain has spent two
weeks mirroring everything.

2372
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:16,301
I see.

2373
01:00:16,301 --> 01:00:17,440
But if you don't know how to play,

2374
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:18,340
if you've never played,

2375
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,600
your body won't do it.

2376
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,560
So you have to have,

2377
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,610
you have to have a model for,

2378
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:24,360
for this to work.

2379
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,350
Totally makes sense.

2380
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:25,801
Yeah.

2381
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:27,060
Because like something like tennis,

2382
01:00:27,061 --> 01:00:32,061
like I've maybe played once in my whole
life when I was in my early twenties,

2383
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,820
so you wouldn't get as much benefit.

2384
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,050
I wouldn't get anything because
I'm not going to play again.

2385
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:37,551
I don't think.

2386
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,820
I just don't have time in the day.

2387
01:00:38,821 --> 01:00:39,654
But I,

2388
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,160
I totally understand that.

2389
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,540
That totally makes sense.

2390
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,540
I think that probably is the case with
pretty much everything that people do.

2391
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,040
It's one of the reasons why,

2392
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:47,670
uh,

2393
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:51,690
a sense of community amongst people that
are all involved in the same sort of

2394
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:52,150
endeavor.

2395
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:56,220
So important because you kind of push
each other and inspire each other and also

2396
01:00:56,221 --> 01:00:57,810
you kind of feed off of each other.

2397
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:58,590
Maybe one,

2398
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,720
like if we were all comedians,

2399
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,720
maybe you would have like a certain kind
of style that I don't have and I would

2400
01:01:03,721 --> 01:01:04,554
see your style go,

2401
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,011
oh,

2402
01:01:05,011 --> 01:01:06,720
Jane's got this crazy
thing she's doing well,

2403
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:07,620
that's Kinda cool.

2404
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,440
And then like maybe I would do something
that you didn't do and you're like,

2405
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:15,441
maybe I need to like be more this or me
more and sort of tune into how people

2406
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:18,450
are doing to the point where a lot of
comics when they're around each other,

2407
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:19,410
um,

2408
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:24,410
it becomes an issue sometimes because
they kind of mimic each other's personas

2409
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,200
or,

2410
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,590
or maybe just the cadence.

2411
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:27,020
Yeah.

2412
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,340
Thank you.

2413
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,080
Start picking up.

2414
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,201
Well,

2415
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:29,350
there's a guy named David towl.

2416
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:30,630
It's like one of the funniest guys ever.

2417
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:31,500
And uh,

2418
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,740
he's got a way of talking
that's really fun.

2419
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,850
And when he talks,

2420
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:40,851
like there's so many young guys that come
up that star talking like Dave a towel

2421
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,570
and it's like,

2422
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,690
it became an issue where there
was like all these little,

2423
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,060
like Patrice O'Neal Eastcom tell babies.

2424
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,081
There was all these,

2425
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:49,141
uh,

2426
01:01:49,141 --> 01:01:50,700
tell babies that were running around it.

2427
01:01:50,701 --> 01:01:51,600
But it really,

2428
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:55,500
they're just young comics
that admire is sorta Kate in.

2429
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:56,760
They're trying to do it too.

2430
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,940
And they were like super inspired because
they're young and they're just trying

2431
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:00,511
to make it,

2432
01:02:00,511 --> 01:02:02,190
and then to seeing this guy who's this,

2433
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:02,371
you know,

2434
01:02:02,371 --> 01:02:04,050
like fantastic comedian,

2435
01:02:04,051 --> 01:02:04,884
like,

2436
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,390
and then they don't even realize it,

2437
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:07,500
but they're just adopting it.

2438
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:07,690
Yeah.

2439
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:08,050
Yeah.

2440
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:08,231
No,

2441
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:09,340
that makes perfect sense.

2442
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:10,174
I mean,

2443
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,013
you just,

2444
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:11,890
uh,

2445
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:12,910
it becomes a template.

2446
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:13,230
Yeah.

2447
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,440
Nobody exists in a vacuum.

2448
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:14,710
Right?

2449
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:14,921
I mean,

2450
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:16,120
everybody sort of,

2451
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,010
there's the,

2452
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:20,190
everyone influences everyone
around to a certain extent.

2453
01:02:20,191 --> 01:02:24,150
We all want to believe that we're some
rogue independent operator that exists

2454
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:27,210
out in the fringe of society and lives
in a fucking wooden house in the woods

2455
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:27,690
somewhere.

2456
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,523
That sounds nice.

2457
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,421
It sounds nice,

2458
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:30,811
but it's a,

2459
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:32,650
it's a k it's a creation of fiction.

2460
01:02:32,651 --> 01:02:32,790
Yeah.

2461
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,211
Oh yeah,

2462
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:33,391
no,

2463
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:33,811
and it's funny,

2464
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:35,100
I some of the um,

2465
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:35,940
uh,

2466
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,511
someone I admire,

2467
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:37,270
Clive Thompson,

2468
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:40,140
he writes a lot about technology
for like wired and your times.

2469
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:40,671
Um,

2470
01:02:40,671 --> 01:02:42,930
and he had a book out recently about,

2471
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:43,081
you know,

2472
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:44,640
is technology changing our brain.

2473
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,590
And the opening chapter says,

2474
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:46,900
you know,

2475
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,700
newsflash,

2476
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,240
everything changes your brain.

2477
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,550
This sentence you just read,

2478
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,750
it changed your rain.

2479
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:52,190
Right?

2480
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:55,890
So I mean on one hand it's sort of
silly to look at research that says,

2481
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:56,210
Oh,

2482
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,050
games change your brain
like this or you know,

2483
01:02:58,051 --> 01:02:59,070
music changed everything like that.

2484
01:02:59,330 --> 01:02:59,730
Um,

2485
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:00,750
because everything you do,

2486
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:05,400
everything you're exposed to changes
your rain and you're making a memory or

2487
01:03:05,401 --> 01:03:05,820
your,

2488
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,680
your sort of activating a pattern.

2489
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:08,280
Um,

2490
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,560
so I mean like even this conversation,

2491
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,453
you know,

2492
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,890
congratulations like you
have changed my brain today,

2493
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:16,360
but this is just something to think about,

2494
01:03:16,361 --> 01:03:19,520
like a lot of responsibility and I
know how we interact with each other.

2495
01:03:19,521 --> 01:03:19,590
Yeah.

2496
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,423
It is.

2497
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:20,850
And,

2498
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:21,270
well,

2499
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:25,200
that's one of the weirdest things about
doing a podcast is how many people will

2500
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,590
tell me after they listened to
podcasts for our 500 episodes,

2501
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,171
dude,

2502
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:30,060
you changed my life.

2503
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,690
Oh yeah.

2504
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,200
Good.

2505
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,850
It's a lot of responsibility,

2506
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,640
but we really are changing
each other's lives.

2507
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:35,851
I mean,

2508
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:37,350
the podcast has changed my life.

2509
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,510
Just being able to talk to
all these different people.

2510
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,910
It's why it's important not to
have dip shits and your life.

2511
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,030
Because if you're around people that
are just constantly fucking up and

2512
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:47,760
constantly making the same
mistakes over and over again,

2513
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:50,190
like that pattern affects you too.

2514
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:50,670
Yeah.

2515
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,800
That pattern will creep into your mind.

2516
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:53,390
Yes.

2517
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:53,931
Well then say,

2518
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:54,351
you know,

2519
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:54,680
it's,

2520
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,190
it's,

2521
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:58,380
it's really good to try and yourself
with people who inspire you because they,

2522
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:01,160
they talk about having a cognitive
model for behavior change.

2523
01:04:01,161 --> 01:04:03,470
Like if you're trying to
get better in some way,

2524
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,400
uh,

2525
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,510
if you can visually,

2526
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:08,780
if you know somebody who's already done
it or doing positive things in their

2527
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:09,470
lives,

2528
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:09,950
it's,

2529
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:13,550
it requires less energy for your
brain to imagine yourself doing it.

2530
01:04:13,551 --> 01:04:13,671
Like,

2531
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:14,070
if you're,

2532
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,690
if you don't,

2533
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,060
if you're not trying to be anybody who's
trying to get healthy or trying to get

2534
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:18,170
fit or whatever it is,

2535
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,310
um,

2536
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:19,700
it's like,

2537
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,500
it's literally harder to imagine.

2538
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:25,880
And so it's like more exhausting for
you to try to imagine yourself getting

2539
01:04:25,881 --> 01:04:26,510
better.

2540
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,550
Whereas if you're surrounded
by people who are doing it,

2541
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,170
it becomes familiar to your brain.

2542
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:32,930
There's all sorts of examples
that your brain can call on.

2543
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:37,520
It literally takes less energy for you
to imagine yourself actually doing it.

2544
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:38,810
And weirdly,

2545
01:04:38,811 --> 01:04:41,630
they found at Stanford University using,

2546
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:41,960
uh,

2547
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,890
like avatars.

2548
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,820
If you can see an Avatar that
is designed to look like you,

2549
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,920
like doing the sort of
things you want to do,

2550
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,341
like,

2551
01:04:49,341 --> 01:04:49,521
you know,

2552
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:50,510
being really physically fit,

2553
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,950
like working out in the game world.

2554
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,850
If you just watch an avatar customer
design to look like you doing that,

2555
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:59,030
it lowers the cognitive
threshold for you to do it.

2556
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:01,130
And then you will do more in real life.

2557
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:01,460
You leave,

2558
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,120
you know,

2559
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:07,120
you will work out more or you'll spend
more time committed to those goals just

2560
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:11,900
by having watched the sort of mirror
version of yourself having done it.

2561
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,130
That's fascinating that,

2562
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,340
that's fascinating because that seems to
open up a whole new of possibility for

2563
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:20,190
people creating virtual realities.

2564
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:20,620
Yeah.

2565
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,000
Like virtual realities where you're,

2566
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:22,630
what,

2567
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,630
like one of the big things that they
say it's an important for progress in

2568
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:28,491
sports and,

2569
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,520
and in pretty much
anything is visualization.

2570
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,080
Visualize yourself doing things.

2571
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:33,610
It's a big thing with martial arts.

2572
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:34,341
They,

2573
01:05:34,341 --> 01:05:34,570
uh,

2574
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:35,410
take a lot of fighters.

2575
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:35,541
They,

2576
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:35,920
they,

2577
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,980
they talk them through their scenarios.

2578
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:39,200
They've,

2579
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,770
they will sit down and the close her
eyes and meditate and visualize a

2580
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,650
themselves getting out of bad situations,

2581
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:48,370
visualize themselves winning and do it
over and over and over again to the point

2582
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:52,060
where it becomes like a part
of this is your reality.

2583
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:53,290
Your reality is you win.

2584
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:53,580
Yeah.

2585
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,400
You know,

2586
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,400
it seems like if you could watch a
video of you doing all those things and

2587
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:01,960
artificially created you yup.

2588
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:02,861
Absolutely.

2589
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:05,020
Jumping higher than
you've ever jumped before.

2590
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:07,040
Did scoring and tennis or,

2591
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:08,083
yeah.

2592
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:08,781
So it's like,

2593
01:06:08,781 --> 01:06:08,980
it's,

2594
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:09,200
it's,

2595
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,570
there's a little bit of nuance
to it that's really interesting.

2596
01:06:11,571 --> 01:06:12,320
So,

2597
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,153
um,

2598
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,061
for example,

2599
01:06:14,061 --> 01:06:19,061
if you are like walking on a treadmill
while you're watching a custom avatar of

2600
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:20,960
yourself and the Avatar,

2601
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:21,231
you know,

2602
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:24,170
starts running faster
and is getting fitter,

2603
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,610
you will run faster,

2604
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:26,190
you will,

2605
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:26,961
you will work harder.

2606
01:06:26,961 --> 01:06:29,840
If you are engaged in an activity,

2607
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,733
it can really,

2608
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:31,780
uh,

2609
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,140
get you moving.

2610
01:06:33,141 --> 01:06:33,950
So it was like,

2611
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:37,130
it would be good to tie it to
when you're actually working out.

2612
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:38,060
Like it might not be,

2613
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,740
it might not last for,

2614
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,430
you know,

2615
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:44,270
I watched this movie today and a week
later I'm still feeling more powerful.

2616
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:46,010
You kind of want to do it in the moment.

2617
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,030
Um,

2618
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:50,270
are they the one study at
Sanford found for 24 hours?

2619
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:51,350
They were safe,

2620
01:06:51,351 --> 01:06:51,780
sort of,

2621
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,090
were more physically active,

2622
01:06:53,091 --> 01:06:55,580
like taking stairs or doing
more pushups or whatever.

2623
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,833
Um,

2624
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,793
but uh,

2625
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,640
but I do like the idea of
using it perfectly like that.

2626
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,400
The one thing they know is like
for positive visualization,

2627
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:05,151
I don't know if you've seen,

2628
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:09,940
there's been new research coming out
that you have to visualize the effortful

2629
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,900
action and not the outcome.

2630
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,490
Like if you're visualizing getting,

2631
01:07:13,491 --> 01:07:13,820
you know,

2632
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,650
lifted up on people with people shoulders,

2633
01:07:15,651 --> 01:07:17,090
like I'm the champion.

2634
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,260
Um,

2635
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:22,250
that actually seems to sometimes have a
counter productive effect because your

2636
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:24,500
brain can imagine it so vividly.

2637
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:27,380
You kind of feel like you've
already had that payoff and your,

2638
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,760
you put in less effort that does ms
studies for a few years at show this.

2639
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:32,870
Um,

2640
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:33,560
so,

2641
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,711
uh,

2642
01:07:33,711 --> 01:07:37,280
but if you're visualizing the effortful
activity that it takes to get there,

2643
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:38,360
you're picturing,

2644
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:38,631
you know,

2645
01:07:38,631 --> 01:07:41,360
here's what I have to do on game
day and you're thinking about,

2646
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:42,530
um,

2647
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:42,801
the,

2648
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:46,580
the things that require effort on
your part techniques or you know,

2649
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:46,870
the,

2650
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,350
the actions you're going to take.

2651
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,220
Um,

2652
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,150
that is helpful.

2653
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,040
So you just don't want to think about,

2654
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:52,581
you know,

2655
01:07:52,581 --> 01:07:53,690
I can't wait til they,

2656
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:54,643
you know,

2657
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,500
call me up and say that I won.

2658
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:57,170
Right.

2659
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,190
Whatever you have,

2660
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:58,911
you can't think about it.

2661
01:07:58,911 --> 01:07:59,180
Just,

2662
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,480
you have to be visualizing the things
that are going to require effort and

2663
01:08:02,481 --> 01:08:04,280
energy on your part.

2664
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:04,940
That's the,

2665
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:08,090
that's that seems to be the most help.

2666
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,190
It's so fascinating because like
just that statement right there,

2667
01:08:11,191 --> 01:08:13,770
that seems to be the most helpful.

2668
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:16,190
There's so much weirdness
and all this is so it's,

2669
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,630
it's like magic.

2670
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,130
Like what the fuck is going on?

2671
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:20,060
Like what the,

2672
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,680
with the visualization process,

2673
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,250
what's the mechanism like what,

2674
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,020
what,

2675
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,550
what is it an inspiration?

2676
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:27,380
I mean how much of inspiration,

2677
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:31,040
how much is inspiration
a factor in success?

2678
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,930
I would say probably gigantic.

2679
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:33,440
Right?

2680
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,270
So is that all right?

2681
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:35,103
I mean there's,

2682
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:37,930
there's so many different avenues I am,

2683
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:42,100
I focus on self efficacy as
what you're trying to increase.

2684
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:42,611
Uh,

2685
01:08:42,611 --> 01:08:43,880
as opposed to inspiration.

2686
01:08:43,881 --> 01:08:48,580
So self efficacy is when you feel like
you have the skills and abilities and

2687
01:08:48,581 --> 01:08:50,650
resources you need to achieve your goal.

2688
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,250
And it's,

2689
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:51,790
it's,

2690
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:52,990
it's different from self esteem.

2691
01:08:52,991 --> 01:08:53,800
Self esteem is like,

2692
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,041
Oh,

2693
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,180
I'm a good person United.

2694
01:08:55,181 --> 01:08:56,740
Sort of like myself.

2695
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,690
Self efficacy is very specific.

2696
01:08:58,691 --> 01:08:58,900
Like,

2697
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,450
if I have self efficacy
about running a marathon,

2698
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:04,330
it means that I have done and you know,

2699
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:06,130
at least a few 20 mile runs.

2700
01:09:06,131 --> 01:09:07,750
I know how hard it's going to be.

2701
01:09:07,751 --> 01:09:08,650
I've got my receipt,

2702
01:09:08,651 --> 01:09:09,071
I know how to,

2703
01:09:09,071 --> 01:09:09,371
you know,

2704
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:10,600
fuel during the Ron.

2705
01:09:10,601 --> 01:09:11,830
I know how much I hate to take sodium.

2706
01:09:11,831 --> 01:09:13,150
I have to take a different points.

2707
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,530
I know what the course looks like,

2708
01:09:14,531 --> 01:09:15,730
so I've got a mental plan.

2709
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:21,180
Having that sense of reasonable optimism
and focusing on visualizing what you'll

2710
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:28,381
do successfully that's focused on your
own skills and abilities that in all of

2711
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:31,240
the scientific literature is
linked to better outcomes.

2712
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:34,630
Whereas if you're imagining things
that are outside of your control,

2713
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:39,990
it just doesn't because how is it
might inspire you and maybe you'll,

2714
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:40,780
you know,

2715
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,440
get out of bed and put
more of an effort as you,

2716
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,000
you know,

2717
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,610
picture something good happening to you.

2718
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,270
But the,

2719
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:52,320
the mental model that seems to be most
powerful is when you're focusing on

2720
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,660
things that you have direct control over,

2721
01:09:55,661 --> 01:09:56,590
if that makes sense.

2722
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:58,110
Yeah.

2723
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,710
The self efficacy.

2724
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:03,330
Well,

2725
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:06,180
how much of all that is just a little,

2726
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,160
what you were talking about is just
focus is just thinking about what you're

2727
01:10:11,161 --> 01:10:14,190
doing and the more you think about what
you're doing and the more energy you put

2728
01:10:14,191 --> 01:10:15,480
towards what you're
doing makes you better.

2729
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,140
And how much of this is just mean?

2730
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:21,480
Is it possible that all these ideas of
just visualization is what you're doing

2731
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:24,570
is really just focusing more and
loving more what you're doing?

2732
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:26,270
I think that could be a big part of it.

2733
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:26,541
I mean,

2734
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:26,990
the,

2735
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,970
the focus attention it,

2736
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:29,840
you're,

2737
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,400
you're able to perform better,

2738
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:32,600
you learn faster.

2739
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:37,550
I think part of it is also something
to do with the dopamine system.

2740
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:38,570
Um,

2741
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:38,961
you know,

2742
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:40,100
in video games.

2743
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:41,503
So if some,

2744
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,090
so I've talked to lots of neuroscientists,

2745
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:44,780
um,

2746
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,350
for this book and um,

2747
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,980
a lot of them will say if you wanna
increase someone's self efficacy,

2748
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,420
you have them play a video game.

2749
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:53,930
Because I'm in a video game,

2750
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,260
you're constantly required to
take action and then wait to see,

2751
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:57,770
you know what,

2752
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,510
I try to fire my weapon.

2753
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:01,280
I wait to see if I shot successfully.

2754
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:03,110
I try to orient around an obstacle,

2755
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:03,711
I'm going to see,

2756
01:11:03,711 --> 01:11:08,000
I'm going to get information every time
that your brain expects information

2757
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:09,020
about your performance,

2758
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,780
it gives you a little dopamine
release and dopamine feels good.

2759
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,160
So you got excited.

2760
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:13,831
Um,

2761
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:18,660
but increased open mean also allows you
to pay closer attention and to learn

2762
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,530
faster,

2763
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,190
right?

2764
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:23,700
So anytime you're trying something
where you're constantly taking actions,

2765
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:26,700
getting feedback and you have
to kind of learn and improve,

2766
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:27,450
uh,

2767
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:31,950
you'll get all this dopamine going and
that is associated with the ability to

2768
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:33,060
build self efficacy.

2769
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,820
So I think that there is a,

2770
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:36,150
I mean,

2771
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:39,510
I think there's a neurochemical
process that's underlying this.

2772
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:40,320
It's not,

2773
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,430
it's not just,

2774
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,330
um,

2775
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:45,080
I mean it's not just a matter of,

2776
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,020
of what you think.

2777
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:50,700
It's also about changing what is going
on in your brain so that the brain is

2778
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:54,570
primed to learn faster to improve.

2779
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,620
And that's um,

2780
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:56,221
that's,

2781
01:11:56,221 --> 01:11:57,054
um,

2782
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,050
that's why,

2783
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:58,680
you know,

2784
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,370
that's why there seemed to be so many
cool applications for video games because

2785
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:07,371
if you can get a cancer patient who
feels really powerless and overwhelmed to

2786
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:13,410
play a video game about chemotherapy
and it starts building self advocacy and

2787
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:14,580
getting all the dopamine going,

2788
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,820
there was a clinical trial that showed
that kids who played a video game about

2789
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:18,654
cancer,

2790
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:23,900
we're for two to three months later
missing fewer doses of their medicine,

2791
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:26,370
taking more antibiotics,

2792
01:12:26,371 --> 01:12:27,570
they were more engaged,

2793
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,080
um,

2794
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,610
which leads to more cases of
cancer being going into remission.

2795
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:33,040
Right?

2796
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,280
But isn't that just more focus?

2797
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,700
Just focusing and thinking,

2798
01:12:36,701 --> 01:12:36,810
man,

2799
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:40,530
it's using it as a mechanism to
focus and think about your illness,

2800
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,100
focus and think about your recovery.

2801
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,980
It's focused with the dopamine hit and
the increased over mean is gonna it,

2802
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:47,460
it,

2803
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,950
it changes what's,

2804
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,810
well now we'll get really deep here.

2805
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,830
Um,

2806
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,660
every time that you consider a goal,

2807
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,090
your brain stops and says,

2808
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:57,930
is it worth it?

2809
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:01,350
Because your brain is trying to conserve
your body's energy and you know,

2810
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,161
they're the,

2811
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:03,270
your cognitive energy.

2812
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,991
And we'll say,

2813
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:04,320
if I,

2814
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,430
if I do this goal,

2815
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,360
am I,

2816
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,193
do I really want it?

2817
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:09,660
Am I going to put the energy to do it?

2818
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:13,020
And what researchers have found is the
more dopamine you have in your reward

2819
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:13,854
pathways,

2820
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,750
the more you focus on the positive
outcome and the less you think about the

2821
01:13:18,751 --> 01:13:19,650
effort required.

2822
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,870
So if I give you a bunch of dopamine hits,

2823
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,130
you're going to be thinking about,

2824
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,480
I might be cured someday.

2825
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,150
I don't care how many side effects
there are to this medicine.

2826
01:13:27,151 --> 01:13:28,500
I'm swallowing this pill,

2827
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:29,340
you know,

2828
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:29,621
and,

2829
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:33,480
and I'm going to do it because you're
focused on the positive outcome,

2830
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:36,780
not all of the other things that
stress you out about it or make you,

2831
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:37,680
you know,

2832
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,820
the nausea and the,

2833
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,270
the,

2834
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,470
the energy that it takes.

2835
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,000
And this is true if you're doing push ups,

2836
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:42,511
you know,

2837
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:42,780
like,

2838
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,820
do I really feel like doing
a hundred pushups right now?

2839
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,360
Um,

2840
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,950
if you have more dopamine going,

2841
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:48,630
you're going to be more likely to say,

2842
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:49,411
this is important to me.

2843
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,370
It's part of my training.

2844
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:51,240
Um,

2845
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,920
and if you are low dopamine,

2846
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:54,420
which is when you're clinically depressed,

2847
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,800
you have really load open mean.

2848
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,960
So everything seems too hard.

2849
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,411
Oh,

2850
01:13:58,411 --> 01:13:59,970
why am I going to bother
getting out of bed?

2851
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,680
There's like the effort required seems
so much more important than the goal.

2852
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:09,840
So there is a neurological underpinning
to self advocacy is sort of this

2853
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:14,841
combination of really wanting to achieve
your goal and having that increased

2854
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:16,450
attention so you learn faster.

2855
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:16,970
So there's,

2856
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:17,803
but you have to,

2857
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:18,520
it's,

2858
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:18,761
I mean,

2859
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:19,450
it's not,

2860
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:20,283
it's not,

2861
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,580
it's not just a matter of saying,

2862
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:22,450
I'm going to pay attention.

2863
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:27,250
Now you have to be priming your brain
to increase the dopamine and your reward

2864
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:27,910
pathways.

2865
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:28,320
Right?

2866
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,380
But the dopamine hit.

2867
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,930
What is the mechanism that
creates the dopamine hit?

2868
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,910
Is it just simply loving
what you're doing,

2869
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:34,744
you know?

2870
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:35,151
No,

2871
01:14:35,151 --> 01:14:35,250
no,

2872
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:35,401
no.

2873
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:36,234
It's gold.

2874
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:36,931
It's gold.

2875
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,400
It's anticipation.

2876
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,271
What specifically?

2877
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:40,530
It's anticipation of feedback.

2878
01:14:40,531 --> 01:14:41,530
So the fastest way for like,

2879
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:43,380
you want it to increase
your dopamine right now,

2880
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:46,980
I would say make a prediction about
something that's going to happen today.

2881
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:47,970
Um,

2882
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:48,930
it could be anything.

2883
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:49,640
I could,

2884
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,660
I predict that song go,

2885
01:14:50,661 --> 01:14:52,800
we'll win today and four sets,

2886
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:53,431
whatever it is.

2887
01:14:53,431 --> 01:14:54,900
You make a prediction about something.

2888
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:56,430
Every time you make a prediction,

2889
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:57,090
your brain's like,

2890
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:57,540
oh,

2891
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:58,373
I might be right.

2892
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,450
I'm going to m n and that'll feel good.

2893
01:15:00,451 --> 01:15:01,284
And if I'm not right,

2894
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,101
I'll learn something.

2895
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:04,320
Why did he lose in five sites or whatever.

2896
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,180
So I make a better prediction next time.

2897
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:07,740
That gives you a dope me.

2898
01:15:07,741 --> 01:15:09,180
And so in a video game,

2899
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,410
when you fire your weapon,

2900
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,180
you have predicted that it's going to
successfully shoot that guy over there and

2901
01:15:15,181 --> 01:15:17,160
you're waiting for to see on the screen.

2902
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,690
Did I miss or did I hit?

2903
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,160
That's why you get a dopamine hit.

2904
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,440
So every time you make a prediction,

2905
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,880
your brain jeers up to either
celebrate that you were right,

2906
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:32,060
Yay success or I got to learn so
that I can do better the next time.

2907
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,390
That's why I think I,

2908
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,071
you know,

2909
01:15:35,071 --> 01:15:36,000
I have friends,

2910
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:40,260
I have one friend in particular that
didn't grow up with any healthy sense of

2911
01:15:40,261 --> 01:15:41,880
competition and it's,

2912
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,230
he's actually talked about that.

2913
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,320
Like if there's one thing that
he could go back and do again,

2914
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:49,950
like he thinks his parents didn't really
instill any sense of competition in

2915
01:15:49,951 --> 01:15:50,101
him.

2916
01:15:50,101 --> 01:15:51,000
And he's one of those guys,

2917
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:51,790
if he's playing a game,

2918
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:52,740
it's not going his way.

2919
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:53,910
He'll pull the plug.

2920
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,300
Oh,

2921
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,440
he'll flip the board over.

2922
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:56,274
He's that guy.

2923
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:57,631
Yeah.

2924
01:15:57,631 --> 01:15:57,931
Right.

2925
01:15:57,931 --> 01:15:58,051
Well,

2926
01:15:58,051 --> 01:16:00,600
you know what's going on in the brain.

2927
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:01,291
So this is,

2928
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:02,160
you have this reaction,

2929
01:16:02,161 --> 01:16:07,161
but to him losing is just devastating
and write James or only if you can win.

2930
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,350
Right.

2931
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:08,501
Well,

2932
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:08,661
and,

2933
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:10,030
and it's probably what's going on.

2934
01:16:10,031 --> 01:16:11,260
It's his brain is saying,

2935
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:12,130
you know,

2936
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:15,520
it's starting to realize no amount of
effort is going to turn this around.

2937
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,320
And so he just walks away.

2938
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:17,531
No,

2939
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:17,960
there's no,

2940
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,201
well,

2941
01:16:18,201 --> 01:16:19,010
not only that,

2942
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:20,240
there's no,

2943
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,590
there's no history of figuring
things out and getting better.

2944
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:25,640
Right.

2945
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,300
Everybody who has ever started anything
and gotten really good at it and knows

2946
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:29,871
it in the beginning,

2947
01:16:29,871 --> 01:16:30,704
you suck.

2948
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:31,340
And it's some,

2949
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,360
it's kind of exciting.

2950
01:16:32,361 --> 01:16:32,750
Yeah.

2951
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,081
Like,

2952
01:16:33,081 --> 01:16:33,914
um,

2953
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,371
you,

2954
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:35,330
you pick something up,

2955
01:16:35,331 --> 01:16:36,740
say a tennis,

2956
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:37,340
you know,

2957
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,930
like if I started to playing tennis today,

2958
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,490
I don't know how to play tennis.

2959
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:44,990
I would suck and it would be exciting
because I would get my ass kicked on.

2960
01:16:44,991 --> 01:16:45,321
I'd be like,

2961
01:16:45,321 --> 01:16:45,621
okay,

2962
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:47,390
I have to figure this fucking thing out.

2963
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,280
Like what makes that ball spin like that?

2964
01:16:49,281 --> 01:16:50,570
How's that guy whacked that ball?

2965
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,021
Oh,

2966
01:16:51,021 --> 01:16:51,381
I see.

2967
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:51,591
He's,

2968
01:16:51,591 --> 01:16:52,040
no,

2969
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,750
he knows he's number crunching.

2970
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:54,171
He's gay.

2971
01:16:54,171 --> 01:16:55,000
He's like data.

2972
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,880
He knows he's got,

2973
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,410
he's chunking information.

2974
01:16:57,411 --> 01:16:59,210
He knows that if I move left,

2975
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:01,430
the ball's going to go there
and he's going to go here and,

2976
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:01,951
Huh,

2977
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:02,710
okay.

2978
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,340
And I don't have that.

2979
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:04,700
So,

2980
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,560
and that experience of getting better,

2981
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:06,891
I mean,

2982
01:17:06,891 --> 01:17:08,720
that's the basis for self efficacy.

2983
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:09,350
Um,

2984
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:10,183
so it's like,

2985
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,630
sometimes people ask me,

2986
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:12,681
like parents will say,

2987
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:13,670
what kids should my,

2988
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:17,180
what game should my kids be
playing for a learning experience?

2989
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,510
But I say every game is designed to be
a learning experience because you're

2990
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,380
supposed to be bad.

2991
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,290
And that's why games feel
so good is that you're,

2992
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,190
you're,

2993
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,390
every time you play a new game,

2994
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,620
you're figuring it out.

2995
01:17:27,621 --> 01:17:28,850
You're learning how it works,

2996
01:17:28,851 --> 01:17:29,690
you're getting better.

2997
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,890
That experience of constantly getting
better and proving to yourself,

2998
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,690
I can figure something out.

2999
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,680
I can improve,

3000
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:38,390
I can master something.

3001
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,230
Um,

3002
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:39,830
that's,

3003
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,560
I mean that's one of the reasons this
is a fundamental reason why people like

3004
01:17:42,561 --> 01:17:45,800
playing games and why they don't
play the same game forever.

3005
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,640
I mean sometimes you do if the game
that you can never master like chess or

3006
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:50,090
something,

3007
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:50,660
you know,

3008
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:51,740
but most people will,

3009
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,820
will really get into a game for a while
and then feel like they have stopped

3010
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,343
improving.

3011
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,400
And so the brain gets,

3012
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:59,090
you know,

3013
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,260
wants to keep learning,

3014
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:01,460
wants to keep getting better.

3015
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:06,590
The dopamine hits are only gonna come
if you aren't sure how to be successful.

3016
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,070
Right.

3017
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,570
So you have to play a new game.

3018
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:10,580
So why we don't play
Tic Tac toe is adults,

3019
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:11,090
right?

3020
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:11,420
Nope.

3021
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:11,601
No.

3022
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:12,890
Dopamine hits from tic TAC toe.

3023
01:18:12,891 --> 01:18:14,540
Cause you know exactly
what's going to happen.

3024
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:15,563
Yeah.

3025
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,860
Bullshit game and keep trying
to tell my five year old,

3026
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,080
it's going to be a draw
every time kids bullshit.

3027
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,590
Um,

3028
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:24,550
but there's,

3029
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:25,020
there's a,

3030
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:27,220
a lead ism attached to chess.

3031
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:28,900
Chess is the only game.

3032
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:30,490
It's considered a,

3033
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:30,750
a,

3034
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:31,960
a worthwhile pursuing.

3035
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:32,853
Now it's terrible.

3036
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:33,791
What is that?

3037
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:37,600
Because parents will tell kids that are
playing video games and they're wasting

3038
01:18:37,601 --> 01:18:38,150
their time.

3039
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:38,500
I know,

3040
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,310
but if you came home when your kid was
playing chess silently with his friend

3041
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,430
and they're just looking at the,

3042
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,081
he be like,

3043
01:18:44,081 --> 01:18:44,410
oh,

3044
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:46,060
my kid is up to a good thing.

3045
01:18:46,061 --> 01:18:46,290
Okay,

3046
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:46,741
sure.

3047
01:18:46,741 --> 01:18:47,210
I mean,

3048
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:50,460
first because Einstein play chess so well,

3049
01:18:50,461 --> 01:18:51,181
I think that's part of it.

3050
01:18:51,181 --> 01:18:51,361
Although,

3051
01:18:51,361 --> 01:18:51,571
you know,

3052
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:54,650
it's really interesting if
you read letters that he
used to write fucking hated

3053
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,210
chess.

3054
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:55,410
No,

3055
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:56,243
he loved it.

3056
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,520
But he wrote to people that he was
worried that he was addicted to it.

3057
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,500
He talked a lot about how,

3058
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,330
how he had this game addiction,

3059
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,700
which is fascinating when
you think about today,

3060
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:06,900
how many people worried about,

3061
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:09,030
I'm addicted to world of
Warcraft or whatever game.

3062
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:12,180
So even Einstein worried
about being addicted

3063
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,620
to his favorite game.

3064
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,050
It is real game addiction
is absolutely real.

3065
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:16,471
It is.

3066
01:19:16,471 --> 01:19:16,940
It is

3067
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,630
a real,

3068
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:18,463
um,

3069
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:18,980
uh,

3070
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:20,060
it is absolutely real.

3071
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,290
And uh,

3072
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,280
there are techniques for
breaking that pattern by the way,

3073
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:26,114
if you would,

3074
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:28,340
do you want it quick
technique for how to break?

3075
01:19:28,341 --> 01:19:28,610
Sure.

3076
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:28,940
Okay.

3077
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,250
There's a whole chapter in,

3078
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:34,220
in the Super Better Book about
the game addiction and how,

3079
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:35,571
how to stop it,

3080
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:36,404
how to reverse it.

3081
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:36,800
Um,

3082
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,240
and what tends to lead people into it.

3083
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,480
Yeah.

3084
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,870
Biggest that's my friend Duncan was on,

3085
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:41,750
uh,

3086
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:45,200
biggest addict I know to video
games always have me feel normal.

3087
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:46,690
Uh,

3088
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:48,520
the biggest predictor for,

3089
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:49,413
uhW,

3090
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:53,140
who will become addicted to games and
feel like it kind of gets out of control

3091
01:19:53,141 --> 01:19:57,610
spirals out of control is if they're
playing for escapist purposes to try to

3092
01:19:57,611 --> 01:19:59,350
block other feelings.

3093
01:19:59,351 --> 01:19:59,470
Like,

3094
01:19:59,470 --> 01:19:59,771
I have these,

3095
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,431
all these problems,

3096
01:20:00,431 --> 01:20:01,630
I'm going to play the game instead.

3097
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,080
I'm,

3098
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,980
I'm feeling anxious,

3099
01:20:02,981 --> 01:20:04,240
I'm going to play the game and said,

3100
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,170
um,

3101
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:07,050
so the way you reverse it is you,

3102
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:07,983
you have to,

3103
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:08,921
I mean,

3104
01:20:08,921 --> 01:20:10,470
I talk about it as playing to get better.

3105
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:13,530
You are instead of playing
to avoid something,

3106
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,370
you focus on what you're doing
that is making you better.

3107
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:20,040
Even if it's just to start
getting better at this game,

3108
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:21,330
then you focus on,

3109
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:21,721
you know,

3110
01:20:21,721 --> 01:20:23,070
why I'm playing with,

3111
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:23,933
you know,

3112
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:24,211
I,

3113
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:28,080
my friends is like improving
my relationships or I'm
focusing on strategy or

3114
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:30,090
building my teamwork
skills or whatever it is.

3115
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,020
You start to think about,

3116
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,190
um,

3117
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:35,640
other goals outside the game that
the game is connected to because the

3118
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:40,641
biological process of addiction is
the narrowing of goals that the brain

3119
01:20:42,181 --> 01:20:42,781
responds to.

3120
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:43,740
This is true for,

3121
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:45,630
for drug addiction.

3122
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:45,990
I mean,

3123
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:47,100
all forms of addiction,

3124
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:47,934
pornography,

3125
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,610
narrowing of goals at the brain response,

3126
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:50,991
right?

3127
01:20:50,991 --> 01:20:51,111
So,

3128
01:20:51,111 --> 01:20:51,321
you know,

3129
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:51,531
I said,

3130
01:20:51,531 --> 01:20:52,700
you get like this dopamine hit.

3131
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:56,240
When you anticipate something good in,

3132
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,620
in addiction,

3133
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:03,460
the brain starts to believe that the only
source of the next dopamine hit is the

3134
01:21:03,561 --> 01:21:04,610
thing you're addicted to.

3135
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:10,180
And you can't imagine other things that
are gonna make you feel that good or

3136
01:21:10,761 --> 01:21:11,660
feel that excited.

3137
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:12,411
And one of,

3138
01:21:12,411 --> 01:21:15,950
there's this great new book called
the biology of desire that lays a

3139
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:16,650
neuroscientist,

3140
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:18,770
kind of lays out all the
new thinking on addiction.

3141
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,810
And the way that you break,

3142
01:21:20,811 --> 01:21:25,010
one of the ways you break out of cycle
for any addiction is to start priming the

3143
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:30,011
brain to anticipate success
or pleasure from other things.

3144
01:21:30,981 --> 01:21:34,850
So you have to just talk about like
widening the scope of what is going to

3145
01:21:34,851 --> 01:21:35,870
provide that dopamine hit.

3146
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:38,060
So in game play you have to stop,

3147
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,380
um,

3148
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:44,380
you have to stop thinking about the
game as the only source of that,

3149
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,080
that,

3150
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,190
that good feeling.

3151
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:51,150
So you have to start thinking about other
goals that you have besides just the

3152
01:21:51,151 --> 01:21:53,930
sort of sense of relief that
the game is going to provide.

3153
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,040
Um hmm.

3154
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:55,710
So

3155
01:21:55,710 --> 01:22:00,270
that's something that they tell addicts
that are drug addicts use channel at

3156
01:22:00,271 --> 01:22:01,650
addiction into something else.

3157
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,970
So that's essentially what they're saying.

3158
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:03,691
They're saying,

3159
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:03,811
well,

3160
01:22:03,811 --> 01:22:05,730
you need to do is find something else,

3161
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:07,800
but that's positive that
you can get addicted to.

3162
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:08,190
Yeah.

3163
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:12,210
So you're seeking out that weird
chemical reaction in the mind,

3164
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:12,571
right.

3165
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:14,510
When you're stimulated by something else.

3166
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:14,940
Right.

3167
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,390
And instead of chasing
crack you'll chase exercise.

3168
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:19,020
Yes.

3169
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,920
But in what we're seeing with games,

3170
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,790
because games aren't inherently dangerous,

3171
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:25,250
you don't have to quit playing games.

3172
01:22:25,251 --> 01:22:29,390
And in fact it can be dangerous to just
go cold Turkey on games because it's

3173
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,060
like taking someone off an
antidepressant without tapering them.

3174
01:22:32,061 --> 01:22:35,090
Because Games have such
a powerful impact on our,

3175
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:36,400
our happiness.

3176
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,020
You know how the kids are
going to listen to this go mom,

3177
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,940
it's dangerous for me to quit this game.

3178
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:41,930
[inaudible] Jane,

3179
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,170
they're like suicide.

3180
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:47,370
I mean their cases of kids who have
killed themselves when their parents turn

3181
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:50,640
off the game and those kids would
have killed themselves over anything.

3182
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,490
I I think,

3183
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:56,010
I think it is likely related to,

3184
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,680
it's the same thing when you take
someone off and ended a precedent and the

3185
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:01,080
brain is no longer having that.

3186
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,073
Uh,

3187
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,533
it's like dope.

3188
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:04,410
You,

3189
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:05,170
you,

3190
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,560
you lose your ability to imagine.

3191
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,740
Is the term it positive?

3192
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,000
Is the term addiction?

3193
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:10,650
Like is that a flawed term?

3194
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:11,380
Like it,

3195
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:16,140
cause it seems like it's so
limited and so narrow in its scope.

3196
01:23:16,141 --> 01:23:16,290
We,

3197
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,310
we think of addiction,

3198
01:23:17,311 --> 01:23:19,140
we think of always on the heroin,

3199
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:19,741
you know,

3200
01:23:19,741 --> 01:23:21,780
like you just automatically think,

3201
01:23:21,781 --> 01:23:26,730
but really what is it that your brain
has locked into these pathways of

3202
01:23:26,731 --> 01:23:28,410
achieving desirable effects?

3203
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,470
Absolutely.

3204
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:29,890
Um,

3205
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:30,550
and that's,

3206
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:31,121
there's a lot,

3207
01:23:31,121 --> 01:23:31,540
I've,

3208
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:35,890
I've done some work with some
real real rotation centers,

3209
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:40,891
recovery centers for addiction where
they're starting to be more aware of this,

3210
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,460
the new sense of what addiction is.

3211
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:45,850
Um,

3212
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:46,990
but if people are interested,

3213
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:50,290
the book that just came out this year
about that the biology of desire does a

3214
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:53,770
really good job of
explaining it because it's,

3215
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:54,580
I mean,

3216
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:54,970
the,

3217
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,350
it's a pretty provocative argument.

3218
01:23:56,351 --> 01:23:58,330
It says that addiction is not a disease.

3219
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:59,290
It's,

3220
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:00,123
it's a fun,

3221
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,311
it's,

3222
01:24:00,311 --> 01:24:02,980
the brain is functioning
absolutely perfectly.

3223
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,990
It's just focusing on,

3224
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,780
it's like hyper focusing on one goal.

3225
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:12,550
But if you had that same brain chemistry
about running a startup company,

3226
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:12,761
I mean,

3227
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:17,020
Mark Zuckerberg was addicted
to his startup in the same
way that someone can get

3228
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:19,570
addicted to a video game
or addicted to a substance,

3229
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,280
you get hyper focused on one goal.

3230
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:22,140
It's your only source of,

3231
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,310
of pleasure and anticipation of,

3232
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,390
um,

3233
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:26,890
these positive feelings.

3234
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:27,971
So it's,

3235
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:29,380
the brain is working properly.

3236
01:24:29,381 --> 01:24:30,214
It's not broken.

3237
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:30,910
It's not,

3238
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:32,440
it's not a disease in that sense.

3239
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:33,100
It's that,

3240
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:33,430
uh,

3241
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:38,260
it has just gotten stuck on
a particular productive yeah.

3242
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:38,500
That,

3243
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,310
that is maybe ultimately not good for
you physically are not good for your,

3244
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,080
the life that you're trying to leave

3245
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,970
career a good rest for
your family life or,

3246
01:24:46,971 --> 01:24:47,370
yeah.

3247
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,800
I had a buddy that was addicted to,

3248
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:50,550
um,

3249
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,050
one of those role playing games,

3250
01:24:52,051 --> 01:24:52,884
trying to,

3251
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:54,990
I guess it was everquest and,

3252
01:24:54,991 --> 01:24:55,380
uh,

3253
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:55,950
he,

3254
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:59,400
he had this really profound statement
we were at the comedy store wants,

3255
01:24:59,401 --> 01:25:01,560
he was one of the managers and uh,

3256
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:02,430
he said,

3257
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:07,430
I am so good at making money in my online
life and so bad at it in my real life.

3258
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:10,471
Yeah.

3259
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:11,010
Yeah.

3260
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,210
And like he was like,

3261
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:14,220
he was sitting there like a broken man.

3262
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:14,821
And I'm like,

3263
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:15,211
how often?

3264
01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:17,250
He plays like eight hours,

3265
01:25:17,251 --> 01:25:17,641
nine,

3266
01:25:17,641 --> 01:25:18,474
10 hours a day.

3267
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,230
Every day.

3268
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:19,430
Yeah.

3269
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,280
I go every day.

3270
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:20,911
And he goes,

3271
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:21,211
yeah,

3272
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:21,701
I,

3273
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:22,170
um,

3274
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:23,130
I can't not play it.

3275
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,020
And then that's when he said that like,

3276
01:25:25,021 --> 01:25:25,350
um,

3277
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:29,820
it was like this rare break from
the game on during his free time.

3278
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:32,670
He wasn't working and he came down to
the comedy store to hang out and he's

3279
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:35,520
pasty white Pale like almost gray skinned.

3280
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:35,630
Yeah.

3281
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,210
Yeah.

3282
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:37,080
Cause he was just like,

3283
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:41,190
just drained mound Nurus sitting
in front of a monitor all the time,

3284
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,380
clicking and moving.

3285
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:42,690
Right.

3286
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:43,520
Yeah.

3287
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,350
And so it's like the
intervention for that,

3288
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:45,801
you know,

3289
01:25:45,801 --> 01:25:48,140
if you were to sort of
follow the guidelines,

3290
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:49,130
uh,

3291
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:49,550
of,

3292
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:52,850
of how you try and get people to sort of
focus on other goals is you would just

3293
01:25:52,851 --> 01:25:53,960
start by asking him,

3294
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,681
well,

3295
01:25:54,681 --> 01:25:56,300
why are you good at
making money in this game?

3296
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:56,750
What,

3297
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:57,350
what,

3298
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:01,410
what does it take in terms of
skill or commitment or reserve?

3299
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,090
What are you,

3300
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:02,601
what are you doing?

3301
01:26:02,601 --> 01:26:03,320
And,

3302
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,153
and,

3303
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,280
and start to think about
strengths and abilities.

3304
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:08,360
And then,

3305
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,193
um,

3306
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,590
when you are thinking about yourself
and what you're good at and what you're

3307
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:13,424
capable of,

3308
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,080
it kind of takes you out of,

3309
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:15,831
you own it.

3310
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:16,664
It's not the game,

3311
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:16,881
right?

3312
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:20,180
The game isn't making
you successful or happy.

3313
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,100
It's your own skills and abilities.

3314
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:23,930
And that seems to be,

3315
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:25,160
if you look at the scientific literature,

3316
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:28,580
just talking about what you own and what,

3317
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:33,610
what is a result of your
skills and abilities that
that helps you broaden that.

3318
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:37,640
So you realize you can
apply that elsewhere.

3319
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:39,170
There might be other venues.

3320
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:42,560
It's not the game that's giving this
to me and this is something that I own.

3321
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:43,723
Right.

3322
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,640
That's so hard to intellectualize.

3323
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:48,060
Now when you're in the grips of addiction.

3324
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,470
I know,

3325
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:48,920
I know.

3326
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,610
It's why this is just like questions in
my book that like literally you can ask

3327
01:26:52,611 --> 01:26:56,100
someone or you can ask yourself so that
you don't have to intellectualize it.

3328
01:26:56,101 --> 01:26:56,934
And we just do the,

3329
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:57,240
so the,

3330
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,580
there are a hundred quests in the book.

3331
01:26:58,610 --> 01:26:59,900
You just do what I do.

3332
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:00,651
What I tell you to do.

3333
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:02,330
They're all designed like
little game missions.

3334
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:03,080
Um,

3335
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:03,913
because it is,

3336
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:05,090
it is,

3337
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:06,650
it is hard to change your mindset.

3338
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:06,921
I mean,

3339
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:07,701
it's definitely hard,

3340
01:27:07,701 --> 01:27:11,840
but what we know from studies of all kinds
of mindset interventions is that once

3341
01:27:11,841 --> 01:27:12,381
you do it,

3342
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:12,951
it sticks.

3343
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:15,800
So unlike a lot of forms
of therapy or medication,

3344
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:17,810
you have to take this pill
for the rest of your life.

3345
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,550
You have to be in therapy for years.

3346
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,350
If you can do a mindset intervention,

3347
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:22,250
it's done,

3348
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,120
benefits are there,

3349
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:28,121
it's locked in and you can have a
five minute mindset intervention and,

3350
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,380
and instead of taking,

3351
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:30,771
you know,

3352
01:27:30,771 --> 01:27:32,480
prescription for the rest of your life.

3353
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:37,040
What I've found to mitigate my addiction
problems or my addictive tendencies is

3354
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,540
just do a bunch of different things.

3355
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:38,910
Yup.

3356
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:42,950
I have a bunch of different activities
that I do and the reason why I'm doing so

3357
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:44,690
many different things is
to keep from locking out.

3358
01:27:44,691 --> 01:27:44,800
Right,

3359
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,431
exactly.

3360
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:47,920
So you've like intuitively
figured that out.

3361
01:27:47,921 --> 01:27:48,160
All right.

3362
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:48,280
Okay.

3363
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,360
Well I figured it out from trial and
error over a long life of addiction.

3364
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:56,070
I grew up being addicted to
a bunch of different things.

3365
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:58,900
At first it was art and
then it became martial arts.

3366
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:03,580
And then as I got older it became
standup comedy and it became a pool.

3367
01:28:03,581 --> 01:28:06,670
I had a real problem with pool to a
point where my manager thought it was

3368
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:07,660
ruining my career.

3369
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,410
Oh my God,

3370
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:09,310
I was playing eight,

3371
01:28:09,311 --> 01:28:10,001
10 hours a day.

3372
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:10,840
I was playing in tournaments.

3373
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,160
All I want to do was play pool.

3374
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,430
I would go do my comedy sets and
then I go play pool till three,

3375
01:28:15,431 --> 01:28:16,480
four o'clock in the morning.

3376
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:19,420
And then I would get up in
the morning and go workout.

3377
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:20,081
I go,

3378
01:28:20,081 --> 01:28:20,790
uh,

3379
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:21,310
you know,

3380
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:23,440
go do my comedy and do the
same thing every night and all.

3381
01:28:23,441 --> 01:28:24,820
But all I was thinking about was the game.

3382
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:27,580
I was thinking about like
knocking the balls into the hole.

3383
01:28:27,581 --> 01:28:28,001
Like the,

3384
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:30,750
they're the dopamine effect
or whatever it is of,

3385
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:31,703
of winning,

3386
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,530
of or of being successful,

3387
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:36,910
of running out the table of having
the ball do what you want it to do.

3388
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:37,390
Yeah.

3389
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:38,890
And because it's so difficult,

3390
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,550
the reward is so much like
anything that's really,

3391
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:43,480
like if you play a game,

3392
01:28:43,481 --> 01:28:44,320
it's really easy,

3393
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,780
but when you win it doesn't mean anything.

3394
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,480
But when you play a game
that's really hard to do.

3395
01:28:49,481 --> 01:28:50,660
That reward is so

3396
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,360
fucking exciting.

3397
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:52,870
Yeah.

3398
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:56,500
But this is interesting cause like you
become a more interesting person as a

3399
01:28:56,501 --> 01:28:58,780
result of having all
the things that you do.

3400
01:28:58,781 --> 01:29:03,781
Like you're like this really unusual
that you have all of these things instead

3401
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:06,900
of being hyper focused on one aspect.

3402
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:07,531
Um,

3403
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,730
so it's probably,

3404
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:10,740
I mean it seems like a good strategy.

3405
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,290
I'm just a broad spectrum junkie.

3406
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:14,520
That might be,

3407
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,710
that could be like a recipe
for a good life though.

3408
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,170
I mean I,

3409
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,090
this is kind of independent,

3410
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:20,070
interested in that idea now.

3411
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,720
Like what you should that should,

3412
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:22,890
that should be like a thing,

3413
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:24,420
broad spectrum junkie.

3414
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:27,240
I mean it works right now,

3415
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:28,800
but it could go off the rails.

3416
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:29,341
Yeah.

3417
01:29:29,341 --> 01:29:30,174
Well you gotta keep,

3418
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:30,990
you gotta keep,

3419
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:35,250
you gotta keep that circle why it's
going off the rails several times in my

3420
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:35,880
life.

3421
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,241
But it's just,

3422
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:36,481
she was like,

3423
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:37,770
even I like with running,

3424
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:38,290
like I,

3425
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:41,040
I definitely use running
for my mental health.

3426
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:41,940
Um,

3427
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:45,510
and if I get an injury
that is really hard for me.

3428
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:49,350
I have to replace it
with something or else,

3429
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:49,651
you know,

3430
01:29:49,651 --> 01:29:51,150
you go into a depression.

3431
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:52,990
It's a big thing with Jujitsu guys.

3432
01:29:52,991 --> 01:29:56,530
It's very difficult for them to take the
time off before they go back and train

3433
01:29:56,531 --> 01:29:57,550
again once they get injured.

3434
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:57,940
Yeah.

3435
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:02,860
And I have a cup of chronic injuries
that I have because one particular of a

3436
01:30:02,861 --> 01:30:03,760
back injury,

3437
01:30:03,761 --> 01:30:05,890
there was a bulging
disc that I just would,

3438
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:06,820
I would ignore.

3439
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:07,150
Right.

3440
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:07,480
I would,

3441
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:07,810
I would,

3442
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:09,490
I would hurt it pretty bad.

3443
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:11,530
And then two weeks later
I'd be sparring again.

3444
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:12,010
Yeah.

3445
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:13,930
Because I was just needed that rush.

3446
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:14,150
Yeah.

3447
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:15,700
Until it got pretty chronic.

3448
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:18,820
And then I had to take a long stretch
off and really let it heal up.

3449
01:30:18,821 --> 01:30:19,420
But it,

3450
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,790
can you give me that perspective?

3451
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:21,780
It feels like,

3452
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,290
I mean,

3453
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:25,290
just hearing you say that makes me think
how really how important is for people

3454
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:28,890
to understand like how this
system works so that you can say,

3455
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:29,760
look,

3456
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,760
my brain's telling me to
go back and work out now.

3457
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:36,240
Even though my doctor said don't
do it and I can Google and it says,

3458
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:37,500
stay off it for six weeks.

3459
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:38,310
Um,

3460
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:41,190
and to understand your brain is telling
you that because it wants a dopamine

3461
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:41,910
hit.

3462
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:44,400
If you really want to
rehabilitate properly,

3463
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:48,420
you need to start doing other
things that produce dopamine hits.

3464
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:48,721
And that's,

3465
01:30:48,721 --> 01:30:49,021
I mean,

3466
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:51,030
fantasy sports for example.

3467
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:54,240
Do you get really into that for
the season that you're taking off?

3468
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:54,840
Um,

3469
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,730
because that's you're making predictions,

3470
01:30:56,731 --> 01:30:57,600
so that's really,

3471
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,750
that's not good work.

3472
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:00,263
It wouldn't work for you.

3473
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,960
No chance works for a lot of people
playing poker then not you need to be

3474
01:31:03,961 --> 01:31:04,770
active.

3475
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:05,380
Physically active.

3476
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:05,621
Yeah.

3477
01:31:05,621 --> 01:31:09,790
There there's has to be actual physical
movement and fucking that nervousness is

3478
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:11,740
a big part of my adrenaline junky thing.

3479
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:12,160
Yeah.

3480
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:13,180
It's actual nerves.

3481
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:15,310
It's like playing poker is,

3482
01:31:15,311 --> 01:31:16,840
it was never exciting to me.

3483
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:19,240
Even if like people are
gambling for a lot of money,

3484
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:23,830
whereas playing pool is extremely
exciting because there's the execution,

3485
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:25,300
the physical explanation of things.

3486
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:26,650
So you're going into flow state.

3487
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,250
Yeah,

3488
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,210
that's what that is,

3489
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:28,480
right?

3490
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,313
Too much.

3491
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:29,950
Well,

3492
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:33,310
I think my brain was wired with
martial arts and competing,

3493
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:36,250
which is extremely exciting,

3494
01:31:36,251 --> 01:31:40,070
but dangerous and thrilling
and the thrills or so high,

3495
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:45,400
like the thrills of competing or just
beyond anything that you can ever get from

3496
01:31:45,401 --> 01:31:47,740
something that's
nonphysical nonthreatening.

3497
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:48,760
It's,

3498
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:52,630
it's high level problem solving with
dire physical health consequences.

3499
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:53,290
Right.

3500
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:57,250
So there's all sorts of craziness involved
in it and the intensity and the focus

3501
01:31:57,251 --> 01:31:58,084
that you need.

3502
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:00,340
So you that guy on the skateboard

3503
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,241
really well then.

3504
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:01,500
Okay.

3505
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,071
Oh yeah.

3506
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:03,960
Two well that's what's
scary about it to me.

3507
01:32:03,961 --> 01:32:04,290
Yeah.

3508
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:07,620
That could have fucking easily been
me when I was 17 or 18 years old.

3509
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,200
I understand all that shit.

3510
01:32:10,201 --> 01:32:12,720
That's why one of the things that freaked
me out the most about those people

3511
01:32:12,721 --> 01:32:15,900
that are tight rope walking
and doing all the jumping,

3512
01:32:15,901 --> 01:32:19,080
those squirrel suits or they jump
off of cliffs and fly around.

3513
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:19,943
Yeah.

3514
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:20,951
That doesn't know.

3515
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:22,740
It freaks me out is that I get it.

3516
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:23,100
Yeah.

3517
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,120
That's what freaks me out.

3518
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:24,900
Yeah.

3519
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,171
Race,

3520
01:32:25,171 --> 01:32:25,951
car driving,

3521
01:32:25,951 --> 01:32:26,730
all that shit is like,

3522
01:32:26,730 --> 01:32:28,530
I understand what this guy's doing.

3523
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,970
He's feeding that monster in his brain
that needs to be shocked and scared and

3524
01:32:32,971 --> 01:32:36,000
thrilled and what's next and you know,

3525
01:32:36,001 --> 01:32:37,290
it's like you feel alive,

3526
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:40,120
not just feel alive but hyper.

3527
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:40,340
Yeah,

3528
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:40,910
yeah,

3529
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:41,270
yeah.

3530
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:42,710
Hyper alive in a very hot,

3531
01:32:42,711 --> 01:32:46,370
it's funny cause you were asking about
focus earlier and obviously when you go

3532
01:32:46,371 --> 01:32:50,180
into that like the intense state
where there is high stakes,

3533
01:32:50,181 --> 01:32:50,900
high risk,

3534
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:51,860
your attention,

3535
01:32:51,861 --> 01:32:53,390
it's so super focused,

3536
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,660
a time slows down and you're
able to see more process more.

3537
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:58,430
So that could be part of,

3538
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,640
I mean did you,

3539
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,950
you're interested in,

3540
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:06,200
in focus because that's a part
of that experience at high,

3541
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,490
which you don't get.

3542
01:33:07,491 --> 01:33:07,700
There's,

3543
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,560
I mean there's lots of highs
where you're not going to happen.

3544
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:11,990
That's kind of heightened
focus and attend.

3545
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:16,260
There's that and there's this state
of peace that's achieved when you've

3546
01:33:16,261 --> 01:33:20,940
overcome almost insurmountable
obstacles and fear and nervousness,

3547
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:22,290
everything else,

3548
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:27,680
like whatever weird problems
that you might be dealing with,

3549
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:28,740
with your personal life.

3550
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,780
They seem so inconsequential.

3551
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:31,291
Like,

3552
01:33:31,291 --> 01:33:31,830
uh,

3553
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:35,370
like when I would have like a
relationship problems or girl,

3554
01:33:35,371 --> 01:33:37,260
I was dating some craziness.

3555
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:38,094
We're about to break up.

3556
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,230
I would go spar and I would be like,

3557
01:33:40,231 --> 01:33:41,970
who gives a fuck?

3558
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:42,320
Yeah.

3559
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:42,571
You know,

3560
01:33:42,571 --> 01:33:42,730
and,

3561
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:43,351
and you know,

3562
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:43,690
I would,

3563
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:46,650
I remember one time having
this conversation with
this girl I was dating was

3564
01:33:46,651 --> 01:33:48,480
like so dramatic and nonsense.

3565
01:33:48,481 --> 01:33:49,080
I'm like,

3566
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,550
so then I guess we're breaking up.

3567
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:50,971
I mean,

3568
01:33:50,971 --> 01:33:51,804
like what,

3569
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:52,771
what are we going to do?

3570
01:33:52,771 --> 01:33:53,431
Like I fuck,

3571
01:33:53,431 --> 01:33:54,264
I can't do this.

3572
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:56,590
Like either we like each other
or we don't like each other.

3573
01:33:56,591 --> 01:33:58,980
Either they're going to hang out and
have fun or we're not going to hang out

3574
01:33:58,981 --> 01:33:59,341
anymore.

3575
01:33:59,341 --> 01:33:59,461
Like,

3576
01:33:59,461 --> 01:34:00,450
I don't want to do this anymore.

3577
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:00,720
Like,

3578
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:00,871
oh,

3579
01:34:00,871 --> 01:34:01,700
you're so cold,

3580
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,690
your early twenties.

3581
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:04,573
Yeah,

3582
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:05,100
sure.

3583
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:09,900
Fucking to do you really gain perspective
instead of wallowing around in this,

3584
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:15,050
because I think there's an addictive
aspect of relationships to breakup,

3585
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:16,850
makeup thing of the,

3586
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:18,420
the highs and the lows of like,

3587
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:23,220
there are some people that are
addicted to arguing in relationships.

3588
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:23,360
Oh,

3589
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:23,970
sure.

3590
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:25,800
Falling in love is an addiction.

3591
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:26,470
Oh yeah.

3592
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:26,850
I mean,

3593
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:29,070
it's literally the same process.

3594
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:31,110
It's the narrowing of
attention on one day.

3595
01:34:31,111 --> 01:34:33,510
The only that person gets you
that excited gets you that,

3596
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:34,350
um,

3597
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:35,790
the bunch of biological tricks.

3598
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:36,000
Yeah.

3599
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:36,391
Age too,

3600
01:34:36,391 --> 01:34:38,070
because your body's trying
to get you to breed.

3601
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:38,520
Yeah.

3602
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:39,420
And what's really,

3603
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:42,330
then you get the really problematic
relationships when that happens for one

3604
01:34:42,331 --> 01:34:43,380
person and not the other.

3605
01:34:43,381 --> 01:34:44,740
And that's why you get stalkers.

3606
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:45,410
Yeah.

3607
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:46,050
Well you get like,

3608
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:46,470
but it's like,

3609
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:49,410
it's why it's why somebody
seems you don't understand.

3610
01:34:49,411 --> 01:34:51,390
Even if you're dating and you
kind of liked that person,

3611
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,370
but they're already there down the road.

3612
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,480
They're like,

3613
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:55,463
they are there,

3614
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,251
they are in love,

3615
01:34:56,251 --> 01:34:57,084
they are addicted.

3616
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:01,430
And then your behavior might seem totally
crazy to me because I'm not there yet.

3617
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,020
And even though I liked you,

3618
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:06,320
because you're further along in that
process and that sort of narrowing of

3619
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:07,154
attention,

3620
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:07,910
uh,

3621
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:08,950
I freak out where it's,

3622
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:09,530
you know,

3623
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:11,900
maybe if I had waited a few more weeks,

3624
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:16,580
I might've been that I might've been far
enough along that it actually doesn't

3625
01:35:16,581 --> 01:35:17,330
scare me off.

3626
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:17,511
You know,

3627
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,520
like people who fall in
love at different rates.

3628
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:20,640
It's not,

3629
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,200
it's not totally though that you're a
crazy person and I'm a normal person and

3630
01:35:24,201 --> 01:35:25,460
therefore I shouldn't date you.

3631
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,630
It's just your further,

3632
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:29,420
the biochemical processes
look a little faster for you.

3633
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:30,643
Um,

3634
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:30,950
it was,

3635
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:34,310
I think like there are couples who break
up too soon because one of them came

3636
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:38,660
kind of cut further along in the addiction
process and the other what a weird

3637
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:39,494
way to look at it.

3638
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:40,770
But yeah,

3639
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:40,981
I mean,

3640
01:35:40,981 --> 01:35:43,860
and also it's like the same exact person.

3641
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:46,650
You could meet them six months
later and they're perfect,

3642
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,610
right?

3643
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:47,810
Yeah.

3644
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:50,420
Or you meet them right now because
maybe they have enough going on yeah.

3645
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:52,250
In their life that they
fall in love slower.

3646
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:52,790
Sure.

3647
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,011
Right.

3648
01:35:53,011 --> 01:35:57,110
Because you'll fall in love faster if
there's nothing else getting you excited

3649
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:57,900
in your day.

3650
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:58,220
Right.

3651
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:58,311
Well,

3652
01:35:58,311 --> 01:36:00,080
it's also that term fall in love.

3653
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:00,440
Like what,

3654
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,910
what exactly is going on there?

3655
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,020
Like what does that mean?

3656
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:03,350
Right.

3657
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:03,621
You know,

3658
01:36:03,621 --> 01:36:08,621
you're just sinking up
whatever personality aspects
that you have holes and

3659
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:12,710
square pegs in round holes and everyone's
trying to figure out where everything

3660
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:13,341
fits in.

3661
01:36:13,341 --> 01:36:16,160
And then there's also a weird thing where,

3662
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:16,820
uh,

3663
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,810
we've all had friends that alter who
they are when they start dating someone.

3664
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:21,090
Yeah.

3665
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:23,300
It's very strange to see too,

3666
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,230
you know,

3667
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:28,100
like they'll stop talking to some of their
friends or they change their behavior

3668
01:36:28,101 --> 01:36:29,960
pretty radically and you're like,

3669
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:30,321
Whoa,

3670
01:36:30,321 --> 01:36:30,730
what's going on?

3671
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:34,340
You're like fitting in to this
mold of the other person requires.

3672
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:34,760
Yeah.

3673
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:38,900
Like one person is either more dominant
or you're both like super fucking

3674
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:39,731
codependence.

3675
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:41,450
So you need each other all the time.

3676
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:42,323
Yeah.

3677
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:43,223
I have a friend.

3678
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,530
This motherfucker can't go
anywhere without his girlfriend.

3679
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,000
He doesn't do anything without her.

3680
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:47,740
I mean,

3681
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:48,190
Eh,

3682
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:48,930
Eh,

3683
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:50,810
w invite them over for a podcast.

3684
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:51,141
Boom.

3685
01:36:51,141 --> 01:36:51,974
Brings his girlfriend,

3686
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:52,551
you know,

3687
01:36:52,551 --> 01:36:53,540
come on over for the game.

3688
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:53,841
Oh,

3689
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:54,920
she's here to great.

3690
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:55,451
You know,

3691
01:36:55,451 --> 01:36:57,620
like he doesn't go to the movies,

3692
01:36:57,621 --> 01:36:58,820
didn't do anything like they were like,

3693
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:59,390
does he,

3694
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:00,180
is he happy?

3695
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,310
It's a fucking mess.

3696
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:02,533
He's a mess.

3697
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,590
But the two of them are a mess together
and it's like in escapable pair.

3698
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:07,453
Gotcha.

3699
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:08,333
Yeah.

3700
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:09,910
That may,

3701
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:10,743
they're happy,

3702
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:11,231
messy,

3703
01:37:11,231 --> 01:37:11,840
happy.

3704
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,400
Maybe.

3705
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:12,881
Maybe.

3706
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:13,680
I Dunno.

3707
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:14,230
I don't know either.

3708
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:14,700
Okay.

3709
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,360
Well,

3710
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,950
what is happiness?

3711
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:17,941
That's strange.

3712
01:37:17,941 --> 01:37:18,151
I mean,

3713
01:37:18,151 --> 01:37:19,380
it's like they're not depressed.

3714
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:20,550
They're not jumping off bridges.

3715
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:21,060
Yeah.

3716
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:21,390
You know,

3717
01:37:21,390 --> 01:37:21,841
the Bolton,

3718
01:37:21,841 --> 01:37:24,330
they're not shooting heroin
and that was all sounds good.

3719
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:26,251
Yeah.

3720
01:37:26,251 --> 01:37:27,030
Like what,

3721
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:29,670
what is it that makes people
addicted to each other?

3722
01:37:29,671 --> 01:37:31,920
Cause they most certainly
get addicted to each other.

3723
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:32,190
Yeah.

3724
01:37:32,190 --> 01:37:35,490
Like the feeling when someone breaks up
with you when you can't believe they're

3725
01:37:35,491 --> 01:37:35,701
gone.

3726
01:37:35,701 --> 01:37:36,180
Yeah.

3727
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:36,390
Yeah.

3728
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:37,161
Like that is like,

3729
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:39,540
I'll like someone's
stolen something from you.

3730
01:37:39,541 --> 01:37:44,130
Like they've stolen your happiness by
taking off and just simply leaving you

3731
01:37:44,131 --> 01:37:44,730
alone.

3732
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:45,390
Yup.

3733
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:46,050
Yup.

3734
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:46,620
You,

3735
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:46,981
they are,

3736
01:37:46,981 --> 01:37:50,290
they are a part of you like your whole,

3737
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:51,320
your,

3738
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:51,620
your,

3739
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:53,370
your whole is missing a slice.

3740
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:54,060
Yeah.

3741
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:54,960
Like the whole of,

3742
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,080
I know that

3743
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,140
it means all the
metaphors that people use.

3744
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,540
It really does feel that way.

3745
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,140
Yeah.

3746
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:00,910
Yeah.

3747
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:02,500
But isn't that a biological trick?

3748
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:03,550
Just to get us to breed,

3749
01:38:03,551 --> 01:38:06,670
like you stick around long
enough to make a baby and then,

3750
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,271
you know,

3751
01:38:07,271 --> 01:38:09,500
fall in love with the baby so
that you raise it and so that,

3752
01:38:09,501 --> 01:38:13,030
that baby can go and have a baby in the
sense of community that you have all

3753
01:38:13,031 --> 01:38:15,850
sorts of is addictive and
it keeps you together,

3754
01:38:15,851 --> 01:38:17,290
which ensures survival.

3755
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:17,621
Oh yeah.

3756
01:38:17,621 --> 01:38:17,741
I mean,

3757
01:38:17,741 --> 01:38:19,480
that's why cooperation feels good.

3758
01:38:19,481 --> 01:38:21,100
It's why kindness feels good.

3759
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:21,670
I mean,

3760
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:22,510
I'm still tricky.

3761
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,201
It is.

3762
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:23,800
And it's like,

3763
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,161
I don't know.

3764
01:38:24,161 --> 01:38:24,910
You can,

3765
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:25,151
I mean,

3766
01:38:25,151 --> 01:38:26,740
I'm a very practical person.

3767
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:29,890
I mean I think I try to
help people feel good.

3768
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,270
I want to feel good,

3769
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,470
know,

3770
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:33,760
cooperation and kindness.

3771
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:34,450
You know,

3772
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:39,190
those things help society
and help evolution and like
we're stronger together.

3773
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:39,880
Yeah.

3774
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,713
And it feels good.

3775
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:41,620
Uh,

3776
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,100
like that's,

3777
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,110
that's practical and you
and I don't mind that.

3778
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:44,830
And you know,

3779
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:46,120
evolution is kind of tricking me.

3780
01:38:46,121 --> 01:38:46,301
I mean,

3781
01:38:46,301 --> 01:38:47,140
I have two babies.

3782
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:50,410
I have a seven month old twin daughters.

3783
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:51,970
Uh,

3784
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:52,570
you know,

3785
01:38:52,570 --> 01:38:52,750
uh,

3786
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:53,020
if,

3787
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,880
if this is a trick of biology,

3788
01:38:54,881 --> 01:38:56,110
how I feel about them,

3789
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:58,210
I'm totally cool with that
because it feels good.

3790
01:38:58,450 --> 01:38:58,870
Yeah.

3791
01:38:58,870 --> 01:39:00,470
That's biology's trick to me.

3792
01:39:00,471 --> 01:39:01,480
It tells me it feels good.

3793
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,141
I like it.

3794
01:39:02,141 --> 01:39:02,471
Thank you.

3795
01:39:02,471 --> 01:39:05,680
Biology for giving me these
feelings I never have before.

3796
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:06,751
Yeah.

3797
01:39:06,751 --> 01:39:10,290
I mean you can kind of intellectualize
it down to the point where it's no longer

3798
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:11,250
enjoyable cause he's,

3799
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:16,260
it isn't life itself a trick in a sense
because it's really temporary no matter

3800
01:39:16,261 --> 01:39:16,621
what.

3801
01:39:16,621 --> 01:39:18,800
You can accumulate all the Audis and,

3802
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:20,970
and beautiful houses and boats you want,

3803
01:39:20,971 --> 01:39:23,070
but the end of the day it's over.

3804
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:23,791
You know,

3805
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:27,600
like you use the sunrises and sunsets
and you've got a certain amount of time

3806
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:28,434
and that's it.

3807
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,840
So you can intellectualize that
to the point where we're like,

3808
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:32,010
well then what's the fucking point?

3809
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:33,540
I'm just going to end it now.

3810
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:35,040
And some people do do that.

3811
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:40,070
They almost get to this thing where
they can't be in the moment because they

3812
01:39:40,111 --> 01:39:41,790
don't know how long the moment lasts.

3813
01:39:41,791 --> 01:39:45,120
And the anticipation of the
moment ending is just too freaky.

3814
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,320
So like fuck this,

3815
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:46,850
I'm out.

3816
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:50,190
It's sort of the same thing as my friend
who can't play the video game if he's

3817
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:51,660
going to lose and he pulls the plug.

3818
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:56,040
I mean really there's a lot of lot
of the same sort of qualities and

3819
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,720
characteristics of that kind of thinking.

3820
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:58,773
I was like,

3821
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:03,570
there's over intellectualizing or over
analyzing to the point where you can't

3822
01:40:03,571 --> 01:40:04,920
even enjoy what it is.

3823
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:08,360
I feel like I really want to work on
this friend of yours like a figure like

3824
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,920
video games therapy to like,

3825
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:12,680
well it sounds like an
interesting project EGOMANIAC.

3826
01:40:12,681 --> 01:40:15,110
You don't want to do it too much problems.

3827
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:16,080
I like by like I liked,

3828
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:16,271
they do.

3829
01:40:16,271 --> 01:40:17,940
Like how would you help
somebody who can't lose

3830
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:22,410
usually be so happy that you're trying
to help them because that means you're

3831
01:40:22,411 --> 01:40:23,244
talking about him.

3832
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:25,320
It's like you're focusing on him.

3833
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:28,170
It was a lot of awe but no,

3834
01:40:28,171 --> 01:40:28,861
I mean he's alive.

3835
01:40:28,861 --> 01:40:31,740
He lives in America is not an
Ethiopia living in a grass house,

3836
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:32,101
you know?

3837
01:40:32,101 --> 01:40:33,720
It's like he's lucky as fuck.

3838
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:34,380
Yeah.

3839
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:35,930
You got to think I,

3840
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:36,480
I,

3841
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,140
it's at a certain point
in time that there's,

3842
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:40,974
there's,

3843
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,020
there's levels to,

3844
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,870
to like happiness and harmony,

3845
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:50,070
the harmony that you achieve with the
environment that you find yourself in and

3846
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:55,071
the more chaos that you create and the
more problems that you create just to

3847
01:40:55,391 --> 01:40:56,980
solve those problems.

3848
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:57,631
It's got it,

3849
01:40:57,631 --> 01:41:01,840
that that energy keeps you from doing
something else and that energy is going to

3850
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:04,390
block you from the other pursuits.

3851
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:05,360
Yeah,

3852
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,200
absolutely.

3853
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:07,130
Yeah.

3854
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:07,311
I mean,

3855
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:11,600
you need to take committed
action towards positive things

3856
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,553
and in a sense,

3857
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:14,510
the entirety of your life

3858
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:15,483
is again,

3859
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,473
of course.

3860
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:17,553
Yes,

3861
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,513
it is.

3862
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:21,370
I have a kind of funny story about that.

3863
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:21,900
Um,

3864
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:22,090
you know,

3865
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:26,050
I did the Colbert report a few
years ago and when you did that,

3866
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:27,010
she'd break character.

3867
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:28,330
So when he comes,

3868
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:29,643
not,

3869
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:30,250
no,

3870
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:30,641
not well,

3871
01:41:30,641 --> 01:41:31,100
not exactly.

3872
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,630
He comes in the dressing room beforehand
and they don't do a pre show interview

3873
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:36,940
because they want you to be kind
of off guard and off balance.

3874
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:39,250
And he comes in and he says,

3875
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:39,461
you know,

3876
01:41:39,461 --> 01:41:40,390
have you seen the show?

3877
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:40,631
Okay,

3878
01:41:40,631 --> 01:41:42,670
I'm going to be in character and a,

3879
01:41:42,671 --> 01:41:46,210
I'm going to be really stupid and stubborn
and your job is to disabuse me of my

3880
01:41:46,211 --> 01:41:48,400
stupid and stubborn ideas.

3881
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:49,480
Um,

3882
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:49,841
and they said,

3883
01:41:49,841 --> 01:41:50,980
now let me ask you a question,

3884
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:53,043
uh,

3885
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:53,830
is,

3886
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:54,370
you know,

3887
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:54,851
his life,

3888
01:41:54,851 --> 01:41:55,570
a game.

3889
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:56,530
And I was like,

3890
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,393
is this,

3891
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:58,240
is he like,

3892
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,470
is he practicing,

3893
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,603
you know,

3894
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:01,990
is this like I am,

3895
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:02,140
I,

3896
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,960
are we practicing some kind of witty
rapport for the show or whatever.

3897
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,381
So I'm like,

3898
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:06,430
I'm trying to go into that mode.

3899
01:42:06,431 --> 01:42:06,791
And I'm like,

3900
01:42:06,791 --> 01:42:07,001
well,

3901
01:42:07,001 --> 01:42:07,211
you know,

3902
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:07,511
yes,

3903
01:42:07,511 --> 01:42:08,171
of course it is.

3904
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:09,004
And he's like,

3905
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,770
if life is a game and we
spend all our time playing it,

3906
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:13,600
why are we so bad at it?

3907
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:14,770
And I'm like,

3908
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:15,970
I'm like totally thrown off of Mike.

3909
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:16,900
Is he being like Phyllis,

3910
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:17,793
I don't like,

3911
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:18,191
anyway,

3912
01:42:18,191 --> 01:42:20,470
it turned out he was actually being
quite philosophical and he had like,

3913
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,910
he had all of these,

3914
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:22,331
you know,

3915
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:23,470
sort of thoughts about,

3916
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,333
you know,

3917
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:24,830
I mean,

3918
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:26,800
we've started mentioning philosophy books,

3919
01:42:26,801 --> 01:42:27,640
he'd ride and everything.

3920
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:28,210
And I was like,

3921
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:28,331
oh,

3922
01:42:28,331 --> 01:42:28,580
okay,

3923
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:28,990
this is like,

3924
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:29,823
not like a,

3925
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:30,791
not like a,

3926
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:31,271
you know,

3927
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,490
ready like banter practice.

3928
01:42:33,491 --> 01:42:34,001
He was like,

3929
01:42:34,001 --> 01:42:35,800
really thinking about that.

3930
01:42:35,801 --> 01:42:36,400
And I always,

3931
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,233
uh,

3932
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:38,140
I have an,

3933
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:42,400
I mean to return to that question and
try to come up with a better answer for

3934
01:42:42,401 --> 01:42:43,190
him someday.

3935
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:43,341
Well,

3936
01:42:43,341 --> 01:42:45,800
it's a complicated game and
there's no instruction book.

3937
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:47,180
That's why we're so bad at it.

3938
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:47,471
I mean,

3939
01:42:47,471 --> 01:42:50,120
it's not everybody's bad
and you run into people,

3940
01:42:50,121 --> 01:42:50,331
you go,

3941
01:42:50,331 --> 01:42:50,691
wow,

3942
01:42:50,691 --> 01:42:53,660
this person is a really
cool game going on.

3943
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:54,140
Yeah.

3944
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:54,973
You know,

3945
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:57,440
but it is just a game.

3946
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:02,480
And essentially what the problem
is that there's loaded words,

3947
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:05,000
like the word addiction is a loaded word.

3948
01:43:05,001 --> 01:43:06,110
It's a loaded term.

3949
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:08,810
I think the word game
is a loaded term too.

3950
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:13,520
It's a complicated series of events
that you're trying to manage.

3951
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:13,880
Yup.

3952
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:18,880
And you're trying to manage risk and
reward and benefit and then positive and

3953
01:43:19,131 --> 01:43:21,080
negative aspects of behavior.

3954
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:22,131
Essentially.

3955
01:43:22,131 --> 01:43:23,660
It's exactly the same as the game.

3956
01:43:23,661 --> 01:43:25,160
They're completely indistinguishable.

3957
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:25,550
Yeah.

3958
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:29,240
It's one of them is just
open ended and there's,

3959
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:29,721
you know,

3960
01:43:29,721 --> 01:43:31,310
there's no clear pathway.

3961
01:43:31,311 --> 01:43:35,120
It's a game that literally you're
standing in the middle of the universe,

3962
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,200
Bam.

3963
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:41,200
And especially in 2015 if you have the
means you can get on a plane and go to

3964
01:43:41,211 --> 01:43:42,680
another part of the game.

3965
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:43,251
You know,

3966
01:43:43,251 --> 01:43:45,980
you could just hop on
a plane and you know,

3967
01:43:45,981 --> 01:43:48,260
we were talking before
this podcast started about,

3968
01:43:48,261 --> 01:43:48,530
uh,

3969
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:49,550
the radio lab,

3970
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,860
a podcast that's today,

3971
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:52,611
um,

3972
01:43:52,611 --> 01:43:54,800
about that guy who was on my podcast,

3973
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:56,630
Cory Nolton and shot that Rhino.

3974
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:01,130
Like that's a guy who took the game
and decided to go to a fucking place.

3975
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:03,380
He totally doesn't belong or has never,

3976
01:44:03,381 --> 01:44:03,651
you know,

3977
01:44:03,651 --> 01:44:05,090
never is not born there,

3978
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,950
whatever shouldn't say doesn't belong,

3979
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:10,910
but a completely different area of the
game and he's doing something over there

3980
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:12,800
and everybody over on
this part of the game,

3981
01:44:12,801 --> 01:44:13,071
it's like,

3982
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:15,380
what the fuck are you doing over there?

3983
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:18,290
Like some guy gets on a boat and
decided to sail across the world,

3984
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:18,411
right?

3985
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:18,510
Like,

3986
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:18,801
Whoa,

3987
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:19,101
Whoa,

3988
01:44:19,101 --> 01:44:19,431
whoa.

3989
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:20,480
What are you doing?

3990
01:44:20,481 --> 01:44:20,870
Right?

3991
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:21,320
Well,

3992
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:24,670
he decided that he's going to go to a
different part of the board and he's going

3993
01:44:24,671 --> 01:44:28,520
to get in a boat and he's going to drink
rainwater and tried to catch fish and

3994
01:44:28,521 --> 01:44:30,120
travel across the fucking ocean.

3995
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:30,741
She's like,

3996
01:44:30,741 --> 01:44:31,381
people are playing,

3997
01:44:31,381 --> 01:44:31,490
right?

3998
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:32,510
Different kinds of games.

3999
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:34,370
So like the guy who wants to kill a rhino,

4000
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,420
that's a combat game and the person
who wants to sail around in the boat is

4001
01:44:38,421 --> 01:44:42,080
doing exploration and adventure
game and other people are doing the,

4002
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:42,860
you know,

4003
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:45,320
collection game where you
are acquiring resources.

4004
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:49,150
Everything that the Rhino guys
doing the collection game well,

4005
01:44:49,151 --> 01:44:49,301
yeah.

4006
01:44:49,301 --> 01:44:50,000
Weird way.

4007
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,181
Right?

4008
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:51,410
He's collecting bodies.

4009
01:44:51,411 --> 01:44:52,010
Yes.

4010
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:52,843
Yeah,

4011
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:53,470
yeah.

4012
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:54,303
Yeah.

4013
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:55,560
And I think the,

4014
01:44:55,561 --> 01:44:57,910
the guy who's on the boat is
doing the collection game too,

4015
01:44:57,911 --> 01:44:59,500
cause he's collecting accolades.

4016
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,370
You know,

4017
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:02,620
I've made it across the ocean.

4018
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:03,493
Oh right.

4019
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:04,680
Yeah.

4020
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:04,960
Yeah.

4021
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,210
The real way to do is go across the ocean.

4022
01:45:07,211 --> 01:45:08,050
Don't tell anybody.

4023
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:08,860
Right.

4024
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:10,270
Where are you bidding
for the last six months?

4025
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:11,230
You know,

4026
01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:12,100
just chilling,

4027
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:13,300
trying to find myself.

4028
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,010
Well you know,

4029
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:14,843
you were on a boat

4030
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:17,580
when Isaiah to training for a marathon.

4031
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:18,563
I was like,

4032
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,550
I'm not telling anybody because I don't,

4033
01:45:20,551 --> 01:45:22,920
I want it to like just internal.

4034
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:23,250
Yeah.

4035
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:24,170
I want it to be from,

4036
01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:24,721
well you know,

4037
01:45:24,721 --> 01:45:28,170
cause it's like this weird bias some
people have about renters that like they

4038
01:45:28,171 --> 01:45:31,290
brag about it a lot or like
they do it to like show off

4039
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:34,760
Gino who says that people
who wish they were running.

4040
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,410
Oh I really believe that.

4041
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:36,530
Yeah.

4042
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:37,520
Cause if you run,

4043
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,110
like I have my friend Cameron,

4044
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,040
Cameron Hanes,

4045
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,960
he's run two ultra marathons.

4046
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:42,970
Hey he'll,

4047
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:43,220
you know,

4048
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:46,280
post about it on his Instagram or he'll
show you his time or something like

4049
01:45:46,281 --> 01:45:46,620
that.

4050
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:47,251
But he's trying to,

4051
01:45:47,251 --> 01:45:47,810
like,

4052
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:52,100
he's an athlete and these sponsored by
a bunch of companies and part of his Gig

4053
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:54,920
is that he inspires people and
he really feels good about that.

4054
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:56,210
It'll be genuine thing that he does,

4055
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,860
takes people running up these mountains.

4056
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:00,290
But you'll see these people
at like bitch about it.

4057
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:01,300
Like this guy's running,

4058
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:03,170
he's run a hundred miles in 24 hours.

4059
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:04,490
If that's unimpressive,

4060
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:05,010
not worth,

4061
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:08,150
then you need to go look in the mirror
and find out what the fuck actually

4062
01:46:08,151 --> 01:46:08,984
impresses you.

4063
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:12,200
You post a picture of your
breakfast you can't get mad about.

4064
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:13,180
Yeah.

4065
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:13,520
Okay.

4066
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:14,430
Then yeah,

4067
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:15,620
my eggs.

4068
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,453
Yeah.

4069
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:18,230
Yes.

4070
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:19,063
I mean it's like,

4071
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:20,060
well,

4072
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:23,300
why do people get upset that you say
you're going to run a marathon and why

4073
01:46:23,301 --> 01:46:24,170
would anybody get upset?

4074
01:46:24,171 --> 01:46:25,490
It's hard to run a marathon.

4075
01:46:25,491 --> 01:46:27,440
You've got to run for three and a half,

4076
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:28,140
four hours,

4077
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:29,240
whatever the hell your time is.

4078
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:29,480
Yeah.

4079
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,190
That's up fucking long time.

4080
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:31,640
Yeah.

4081
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:35,570
It's hard for me to do 20 minutes on the
elliptical machine and not get bored.

4082
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:35,960
Yeah.

4083
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,300
I could keep going for a lot longer.

4084
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:38,750
Yeah.

4085
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:39,740
But at 20 minutes I'm like,

4086
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:40,221
fuck,

4087
01:46:40,221 --> 01:46:41,054
am I done?

4088
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,850
Jay is as Christ get this over with.

4089
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:46,400
When someone says they ran a marathon,

4090
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:49,310
you start to question your own resolve.

4091
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:50,363
Yes.

4092
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:52,350
Which is like one of the
reasons why they do it.

4093
01:46:52,351 --> 01:46:53,550
You're showing your score.

4094
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:53,910
Yeah.

4095
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:56,310
You're showing your game score
and people are getting pissed.

4096
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:56,670
Yeah.

4097
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:57,503
Too High.

4098
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:59,370
Fucking showing her highest score.

4099
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:00,240
But sometimes,

4100
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:05,310
sometimes I will post a terrible run
cause I like you don't want to be too

4101
01:47:05,311 --> 01:47:07,200
inspiring that people feel
like they can't do it.

4102
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,460
Like fuck those people.

4103
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:12,060
I'll do it slow run so
that people will see like,

4104
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,950
oh you're tricking you
into doing shitty scores.

4105
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:18,510
They're tricking you.

4106
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:19,643
That's true.

4107
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:20,730
So true.

4108
01:47:20,730 --> 01:47:21,880
Well there's definitely that.

4109
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:26,430
There's is a lot of people who when
someone will accomplish something I will,

4110
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:31,431
I'm fascinated by watching the observers
and one of the Instagram observers of

4111
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:33,720
the most fascinating cause
whenever I go to someone's page,

4112
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:34,830
someone's done something cool.

4113
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:37,470
Like you know my friend Cameron
running a hundred miles,

4114
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,860
I'll look at the,

4115
01:47:38,861 --> 01:47:39,061
the,

4116
01:47:39,061 --> 01:47:43,260
the negative comments and I go to their
Instagram page and they're almost always

4117
01:47:43,261 --> 01:47:43,951
blocked.

4118
01:47:43,951 --> 01:47:45,240
It's almost always private,

4119
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:46,291
like locked.

4120
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:46,651
Like you,

4121
01:47:46,651 --> 01:47:47,490
you have to,

4122
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:51,240
you have to be one of their accepted
friends on the comment on their pictures

4123
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,740
because they're hiding.

4124
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:53,190
Right.

4125
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:55,860
Cause they're not putting
themselves out there.

4126
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:56,070
Right.

4127
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:57,390
They're not showing their life

4128
01:47:57,610 --> 01:48:00,580
and which means they don't understand
the vulnerability involved.

4129
01:48:00,581 --> 01:48:01,330
Like if you were,

4130
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:06,010
if you had the experience of having
other people write on your stuff the same

4131
01:48:06,011 --> 01:48:07,330
way that you were doing on someone else,

4132
01:48:07,450 --> 01:48:09,010
you might not be doing that.

4133
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:09,321
Well,

4134
01:48:09,321 --> 01:48:10,520
they're playing the low,

4135
01:48:10,521 --> 01:48:12,080
they're playing tic TAC toe,

4136
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:12,450
right?

4137
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:12,560
Yeah.

4138
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,570
Or someone else's out there playing chess.

4139
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:15,020
Yeah.

4140
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:18,620
That's gotta be like the
new like zing my man.

4141
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,970
You're playing tic TAC toe.

4142
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:20,090
Yeah.

4143
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:22,550
That's like tic Tac toe
play a mother fucker.

4144
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:23,271
Yeah.

4145
01:48:23,271 --> 01:48:24,860
I mean it is kind of what it is.

4146
01:48:24,861 --> 01:48:28,760
If life is this really super complex,

4147
01:48:28,761 --> 01:48:33,350
open ended game where essentially if
you live in a free culture like we do,

4148
01:48:33,351 --> 01:48:33,530
you know,

4149
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:37,010
we're not living in North Korea where
you're assigned a job and if you don't cry

4150
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:38,180
when something happens,

4151
01:48:38,181 --> 01:48:38,361
you know,

4152
01:48:38,361 --> 01:48:39,180
you go to jail,

4153
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:39,530
you,

4154
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:39,951
your,

4155
01:48:39,951 --> 01:48:41,990
your game is essentially open ended.

4156
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:42,230
Yep.

4157
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:43,010
It's not,

4158
01:48:43,010 --> 01:48:45,560
that's one of the reasons why
when people get out of jail,

4159
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:49,640
they find themselves like
institutionalize is the word,

4160
01:48:49,641 --> 01:48:52,850
but they find themselves so
trapped in the game of jail.

4161
01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:53,140
Yeah.

4162
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,830
That's how their brain is wired.

4163
01:48:54,831 --> 01:48:59,210
It's really extremely difficult for
them to deal with the open ended game of

4164
01:48:59,211 --> 01:48:59,770
life.

4165
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:00,490
Yeah.

4166
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:00,910
Yeah.

4167
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:01,211
I mean,

4168
01:49:01,211 --> 01:49:04,750
even for UC it with when
someone graduates college,

4169
01:49:04,751 --> 01:49:08,980
kids who have been from the top colleges
who have been taught to play the game

4170
01:49:08,981 --> 01:49:12,640
of achieving and achieving in
this really rigid structure,

4171
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:16,630
and then they get out into the world
and nobody's telling them here,

4172
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:20,860
here are the things you have to do
to be considered a good student or be

4173
01:49:20,861 --> 01:49:21,694
successful.

4174
01:49:21,970 --> 01:49:23,170
And then they just lose it.

4175
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:24,520
It's too much.

4176
01:49:24,521 --> 01:49:24,880
Yeah.

4177
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,713
Because they don't,

4178
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:26,680
they are not,

4179
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:28,660
they have not been
directing their own game.

4180
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:29,561
Right.

4181
01:49:29,561 --> 01:49:30,394
It's like you,

4182
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,241
if you,

4183
01:49:31,241 --> 01:49:34,990
if you haven't been designing the game
now you have to suddenly acquire that

4184
01:49:34,991 --> 01:49:35,540
skill.

4185
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:38,930
It's also one of the problems that
some people have with career academics.

4186
01:49:38,931 --> 01:49:42,950
People that never participated
in the real world.

4187
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:47,390
They went from college to teach
in college and then they also,

4188
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:51,400
they require these rigid
standards of behavior and things.

4189
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:51,761
I know,

4190
01:49:51,761 --> 01:49:53,140
I heard your show about that.

4191
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:53,601
Yeah.

4192
01:49:53,601 --> 01:49:53,770
Dot.

4193
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:54,730
The Atlantic article.

4194
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:55,320
Awesome.

4195
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,110
Yeah,

4196
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:56,800
that is,

4197
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:56,921
well,

4198
01:49:56,921 --> 01:50:01,921
it's interesting because I've been
so steeped in psychology literature,

4199
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:03,370
um,

4200
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:04,280
and uh,

4201
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:07,330
a lot of the folks who play super
better are traumatized and they've,

4202
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,360
they've been through PTSD and it is
absolutely true that avoiding triggers

4203
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,150
prolongs the problem.

4204
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:16,481
I mean,

4205
01:50:16,481 --> 01:50:16,850
so I,

4206
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:17,261
I mean,

4207
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:20,860
I can look at the scientific literature
and say trigger warnings are actually

4208
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:21,460
not,

4209
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,121
they're not going to help.

4210
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:23,860
They're going to make
you weaker over time.

4211
01:50:23,861 --> 01:50:24,940
It's like we were talking about,

4212
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:25,750
you know,

4213
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:25,871
oh,

4214
01:50:25,871 --> 01:50:27,100
I'm so scared of the bad guy.

4215
01:50:27,101 --> 01:50:29,590
I have to avoid everything
that is a trigger.

4216
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:30,220
Um,

4217
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:31,720
we know that that's not true.

4218
01:50:31,721 --> 01:50:32,231
So when I,

4219
01:50:32,231 --> 01:50:32,471
you know,

4220
01:50:32,471 --> 01:50:33,430
when I hear about that,

4221
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,061
I,

4222
01:50:34,061 --> 01:50:34,301
you know,

4223
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:35,134
I wish,

4224
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:37,450
and I try to talk to people and I
tweet when that article came out,

4225
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:40,240
I tweeted about it and I have a lot
of people who follow me who are,

4226
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:41,463
you know,

4227
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:46,360
have PTSD and they're very conflicted
about whether they're supposed to avoid

4228
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:49,720
triggers and they like trigger warnings
cause they think it's going to keep them

4229
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:50,410
safe.

4230
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:54,520
But for everything we know is that you
need to get better at controlling your

4231
01:50:54,521 --> 01:50:55,600
reaction to the trigger.

4232
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,430
Avoiding it doesn't help.

4233
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:57,911
So I can,

4234
01:50:57,911 --> 01:50:59,680
I can see why that's so
frustrating to people.

4235
01:50:59,850 --> 01:50:59,971
Well,

4236
01:50:59,971 --> 01:51:00,061
the,

4237
01:51:00,061 --> 01:51:00,330
for the,

4238
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:04,410
one of the most frustrating aspects
of that article in particular was that

4239
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:08,020
what's going on in colleges today is it's,

4240
01:51:08,021 --> 01:51:09,240
it's a control issue.

4241
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,630
Yeah.

4242
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:10,210
It's,

4243
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:15,210
they're controlling behavior in such
an extreme way that they're there.

4244
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,540
They want to penalize people
for micro aggressions.

4245
01:51:18,541 --> 01:51:18,870
Right.

4246
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:20,760
Which is like you say something and I go,

4247
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:21,873
alright.

4248
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,930
Which is just a part of a fucking
human interaction with it.

4249
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:28,200
Like if I say something to you and
you give me a sarcastic response,

4250
01:51:28,201 --> 01:51:28,741
I have to decide,

4251
01:51:28,741 --> 01:51:29,280
you know what,

4252
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,230
I don't enjoy communicating
with her because she,

4253
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:33,360
she makes me feel bad.

4254
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:38,220
Or I have to say maybe I'm fucking
Douchey and maybe people react to me in a

4255
01:51:38,221 --> 01:51:42,690
negative way and I should think about
not what I want to say or how I want to

4256
01:51:42,691 --> 01:51:43,201
say things,

4257
01:51:43,201 --> 01:51:46,980
but rather how people might view what
I'm saying and how they take it in.

4258
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:51,120
And maybe I'm just an
ineffective communicator and
maybe what's going on here is

4259
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:51,570
just,

4260
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:51,871
you know,

4261
01:51:51,871 --> 01:51:52,530
there's,

4262
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:54,720
there's like two people playing soccer.

4263
01:51:54,721 --> 01:51:54,961
Okay.

4264
01:51:54,961 --> 01:51:57,210
They're both trying to hit the ball
and they collide into each other.

4265
01:51:57,211 --> 01:51:58,140
Who's fault is it?

4266
01:51:58,170 --> 01:51:58,351
It's,

4267
01:51:58,351 --> 01:51:58,740
well,

4268
01:51:58,740 --> 01:51:59,460
they're both the,

4269
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,440
it's just non smooth movement.

4270
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:02,010
Yup.

4271
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:02,581
And that,

4272
01:52:02,581 --> 01:52:05,400
that sort of interaction that you would
get when you're trying to hit a soccer

4273
01:52:05,401 --> 01:52:06,030
ball.

4274
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:08,790
It's very similar to the interaction that
you had when two people communicating

4275
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:09,550
with each other,

4276
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:12,330
your e the colliding people.

4277
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:16,290
One person is not necessarily totally
responsible for that collision.

4278
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:16,560
Yeah.

4279
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,780
They're both sort of responsible for it.

4280
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:19,733
And there's a,

4281
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:20,410
there's a,

4282
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:25,410
a whole dance going on with poor
decision making in the moment and lack of

4283
01:52:26,191 --> 01:52:30,720
experience and collisions and lack of
an understanding of the consequences of

4284
01:52:30,721 --> 01:52:31,554
those collisions.

4285
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:36,330
All that is a part of going to college
and all that is a part of growing up.

4286
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:39,780
And when you have people that are
shielding you from micro aggressions.

4287
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:40,390
Yeah.

4288
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:44,580
All that shit is just a part of being a
human and dealing with your hormones and

4289
01:52:44,581 --> 01:52:45,540
emotions and yeah,

4290
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:48,590
you're separated from your family for
the first time and now you're in Michigan

4291
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:51,710
and some fucking crazy university
and you've got some fat,

4292
01:52:51,711 --> 01:52:54,680
stupid teacher that's never even
existed outside of the real world.

4293
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:58,280
And they're dictating your
behavior patterns and telling
you you're not allowed

4294
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:01,520
to use a male and female pronouns anymore.

4295
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:02,120
And all this.

4296
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:03,400
I liked the teachers.

4297
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:03,950
I mean,

4298
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:04,550
you know,

4299
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,930
I have a lot of friends who are,

4300
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:07,120
who are,

4301
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:07,670
you know,

4302
01:53:07,670 --> 01:53:08,960
they teach at university,

4303
01:53:08,961 --> 01:53:09,980
so that was dry.

4304
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:11,300
I will remove the fat,

4305
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:12,253
stupid,

4306
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:13,280
well I'm just surprised.

4307
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:18,870
Let's say skinny smart
really yet or whatever.

4308
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:20,670
I'm fat,

4309
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:21,070
stupid.

4310
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:24,420
Does that even mean like physically
what I mean is just like this,

4311
01:53:24,421 --> 01:53:29,421
this bloated sort of lazy entity that is
creating this environment where you're,

4312
01:53:31,921 --> 01:53:34,310
you're establishing this artificial realm.

4313
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:36,060
So is looking at what's going on.

4314
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:41,090
This is not coming from instructors or
faculty that this is coming from the

4315
01:53:41,581 --> 01:53:43,440
students and some of the phenomenon.

4316
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:44,370
But it certainly,

4317
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:45,203
it certainly was,

4318
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:46,703
uh,

4319
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:47,663
I mean it,

4320
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:48,740
it,

4321
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,020
it's,

4322
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:50,550
this is definitely a younger phenomena.

4323
01:53:50,551 --> 01:53:52,860
It doesn't like something like
deeply entrenched people who came up.

4324
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:53,280
I mean,

4325
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,970
my professors are totally like friends
who are professors are totally weirded

4326
01:53:56,971 --> 01:53:57,750
out by it,

4327
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:58,740
don't know how to handle it.

4328
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:00,990
They're not creating that culture.

4329
01:54:00,991 --> 01:54:01,141
I mean,

4330
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:06,141
it's definitely something coming from
the students who have been raised in this

4331
01:54:06,751 --> 01:54:07,950
culture of,

4332
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:08,690
you know,

4333
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:09,000
uh,

4334
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,600
I mean it's that it's a very
protective culture and you don't,

4335
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:14,370
nobody should have their feelings hurt.

4336
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:15,150
Nobody,

4337
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:15,421
you know,

4338
01:54:15,421 --> 01:54:18,480
nobody should experience
failure or rejection.

4339
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:18,981
I mean,

4340
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:19,140
I,

4341
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:23,820
I feel like it's more from that culture
then from anything related to like

4342
01:54:23,821 --> 01:54:26,520
contemporary academia or faculty

4343
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:31,480
thing because isn't contemporary academia
academia overwhelmingly liberal and

4344
01:54:31,481 --> 01:54:32,314
progressive?

4345
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:33,851
Uh,

4346
01:54:33,851 --> 01:54:34,181
I mean,

4347
01:54:34,181 --> 01:54:34,960
I think so.

4348
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,550
I think on the political spectrum,

4349
01:54:36,551 --> 01:54:36,910
yeah,

4350
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:41,910
when you have something that's moving
in one very particular direction,

4351
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:46,820
oftentimes people will try to outdo
themselves or are not in control.

4352
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:47,130
I mean

4353
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:47,491
this is,

4354
01:54:47,491 --> 01:54:48,324
this is,

4355
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:52,650
I think the reason why a student culture
would have so much impact on this is

4356
01:54:52,651 --> 01:54:56,580
because universities are now like
business models and the customer is always

4357
01:54:56,581 --> 01:54:57,360
right.

4358
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,193
I mean that's not,

4359
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:01,290
the professor is not the one who is,

4360
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:02,153
uh,

4361
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:06,420
who is going to like the professors
more often than not resist.

4362
01:55:06,421 --> 01:55:07,950
It's really more at the level of,

4363
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:08,520
uh,

4364
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:09,353
the,

4365
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:09,770
the,

4366
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:12,750
the business side of a college
that is trying to make,

4367
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:13,380
you know,

4368
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:13,641
this,

4369
01:55:13,641 --> 01:55:14,474
uh,

4370
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:15,540
make,

4371
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:19,200
make this a good customer
experience for the student.

4372
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:19,891
I mean,

4373
01:55:19,891 --> 01:55:21,690
I think that is that
it's more of the divine.

4374
01:55:21,691 --> 01:55:22,620
I don't think the,

4375
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:26,730
the political affiliations
of faculty is not,

4376
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:27,150
I mean,

4377
01:55:27,150 --> 01:55:28,680
none of that is really what's going on.

4378
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:32,970
It's really more about the students pay
so much money for college now and they

4379
01:55:32,971 --> 01:55:37,280
expect lots of perks
and they expect their,

4380
01:55:37,281 --> 01:55:39,390
they're paying for a certain experience.

4381
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:40,170
Um,

4382
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:45,120
I think that is really where you're
seeing a lot of the friction come because

4383
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:47,100
that's particularly younger generation is,

4384
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:48,413
um,

4385
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:49,950
seems to be if you look at,

4386
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,240
you know,

4387
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:53,220
what a lot of the experts
are saying they want,

4388
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:57,900
they don't want the things that feel
painful or feel like failure or feeling

4389
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:58,763
stress.

4390
01:55:58,850 --> 01:55:59,031
Well,

4391
01:55:59,031 --> 01:55:59,691
if that's the case,

4392
01:55:59,691 --> 01:56:04,691
then why are they a pointing out all
these flaws and all these other people's

4393
01:56:04,881 --> 01:56:09,881
behavior to control them and flaws
in the way people express themselves.

4394
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:11,670
Flaws.

4395
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:12,400
Yeah.

4396
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:12,501
Well,

4397
01:56:12,501 --> 01:56:12,711
I mean,

4398
01:56:12,711 --> 01:56:13,410
it's,

4399
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:15,380
part of it is obviously
things need to change,

4400
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:15,771
right?

4401
01:56:15,771 --> 01:56:16,130
I mean,

4402
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:17,600
like what needs to change?

4403
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:18,790
For instance,

4404
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:19,450
I'm a woman.

4405
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:20,380
I play games.

4406
01:56:20,410 --> 01:56:22,420
If I log into an online video game,

4407
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:25,710
I don't want to be called a
comment every time I log in.

4408
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:27,410
Does that happen a lot?

4409
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:27,771
Yeah,

4410
01:56:27,771 --> 01:56:28,370
of course.

4411
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:31,040
And do you think that happens a lot
because of what we talked about earlier,

4412
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:35,000
where there's the interaction
of just dealing in text?

4413
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:39,620
This is a very strange and the interaction
without people being right there with

4414
01:56:39,621 --> 01:56:40,250
each other.

4415
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:40,820
Yes.

4416
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:41,091
I mean,

4417
01:56:41,091 --> 01:56:41,930
absolutely.

4418
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:42,840
Um,

4419
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,300
seems like totally unnatural,

4420
01:56:44,301 --> 01:56:44,570
right?

4421
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:44,990
Yes,

4422
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:45,381
yes.

4423
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:45,801
And people,

4424
01:56:45,801 --> 01:56:46,071
I mean,

4425
01:56:46,071 --> 01:56:46,460
I don't,

4426
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:47,630
that doesn't happen to me in real life.

4427
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:47,811
Right.

4428
01:56:47,811 --> 01:56:48,800
That's what I was going to ask.

4429
01:56:48,801 --> 01:56:51,020
Like how many people in real
life say those things to you?

4430
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:52,040
Nobody.

4431
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:52,220
Yeah.

4432
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,031
Like how bizarre,

4433
01:56:53,031 --> 01:56:53,301
right?

4434
01:56:53,301 --> 01:56:53,750
Yeah.

4435
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:55,460
All of a sudden you enter into this world.

4436
01:56:55,730 --> 01:57:00,560
So isn't that a function almost of the
world itself being completely unnatural,

4437
01:57:00,590 --> 01:57:04,490
more so than then the people
being any different in that world?

4438
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:04,911
I'm not sure.

4439
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:05,241
But I mean,

4440
01:57:05,241 --> 01:57:06,390
so all of those say

4441
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:10,820
there are things that people say and do
in everyday life that are legitimately

4442
01:57:10,821 --> 01:57:11,654
offensive.

4443
01:57:11,860 --> 01:57:12,590
Sure.

4444
01:57:12,590 --> 01:57:13,423
Uh,

4445
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:13,881
I mean,

4446
01:57:13,881 --> 01:57:16,230
I don't use the terminology
microaggressions,

4447
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:17,083
I don't use it,

4448
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:18,800
the trigger warning terminology.

4449
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:23,720
So I think we're like in this period
where on one hand things do need to change

4450
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:24,590
and some ways,

4451
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:25,311
you know,

4452
01:57:25,311 --> 01:57:25,421
you,

4453
01:57:25,421 --> 01:57:30,421
you have Nobel laureate scientist giving
speeches where they say that it's,

4454
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:34,370
he doesn't like to have women in the lab
because either they fall in love with

4455
01:57:34,371 --> 01:57:36,710
you or you fall in love with them
and then you can't work together.

4456
01:57:36,711 --> 01:57:37,580
I mean when some,

4457
01:57:37,581 --> 01:57:41,090
when a Nobel laureate says
that to a conference of,

4458
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:41,450
you know,

4459
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:46,160
young scientists that that's
not helpful I don't think,

4460
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:49,480
but I know that that was
taken out of context,

4461
01:57:49,481 --> 01:57:49,661
you know,

4462
01:57:49,661 --> 01:57:50,500
the full extent.

4463
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:55,810
I mean it was a joke and he was also
talking about his wife and because he met

4464
01:57:56,381 --> 01:57:57,970
his wife in the lab and,

4465
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:01,470
and he was also making
himself to be for his,

4466
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:02,860
it was a very self deprecating,

4467
01:58:02,861 --> 01:58:03,880
you didn't know the extent of it.

4468
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:05,110
I did read some sort of

4469
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:08,700
re reassessment of that.

4470
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:08,910
Yep.

4471
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:10,590
Dawkins printed the,

4472
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:10,910
uh,

4473
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:15,690
a full version of what he said
and it's very different also.

4474
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:16,980
Everyone is laughing.

4475
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,240
I read the full version.

4476
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:19,103
Yeah.

4477
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:19,983
Um,

4478
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:21,021
but so it's like,

4479
01:58:21,021 --> 01:58:23,030
so this is actually a
perfect example because,

4480
01:58:23,031 --> 01:58:24,140
so if he was joking,

4481
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:24,920
right.

4482
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:27,440
So his intentions are totally good.

4483
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:31,280
Is it possible that it's still
not helpful to make that,

4484
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:33,020
that kind of a statement?

4485
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:34,101
That's,

4486
01:58:34,101 --> 01:58:35,780
I think that's what
people are talking about,

4487
01:58:36,110 --> 01:58:36,790
right?

4488
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:37,610
Uh,

4489
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:38,240
when,

4490
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:38,600
if,

4491
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:42,520
if on one hand there's a lot of interest
trying to increase the number of women

4492
01:58:42,521 --> 01:58:43,870
in science and technology,

4493
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:49,350
is it possible that somebody would hear
that and still be kind of demotivated by

4494
01:58:49,781 --> 01:58:52,390
it or kind of have that sink in?

4495
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:53,440
So I think people are,

4496
01:58:53,441 --> 01:58:54,100
when they're,

4497
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:55,780
when we're discussing these things,

4498
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:57,100
uh,

4499
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:57,400
I,

4500
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,200
you don't have to police
other people's language,

4501
01:58:59,201 --> 01:58:59,980
but I think it's,

4502
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:04,210
I still think it's useful to
say that might not be helpful.

4503
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:05,521
Yeah.

4504
01:59:05,521 --> 01:59:05,850
The,

4505
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:06,481
there's a,

4506
01:59:06,481 --> 01:59:08,640
an article on the leak transcript,

4507
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:09,090
uh,

4508
01:59:09,090 --> 01:59:10,050
the leak transcript.

4509
01:59:10,051 --> 01:59:13,440
W w what happened was the
people that saw it thought it,

4510
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:13,861
like,

4511
01:59:13,861 --> 01:59:16,680
at least some of them
thought was funny and,

4512
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:21,500
but there were aspects of what he
said that we're probably Clum busy,

4513
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:21,870
right.

4514
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:22,920
Swanky or,

4515
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:23,431
you know,

4516
01:59:23,431 --> 01:59:26,880
he was trying to be funny and he's
really just sort of an odd guy who's a

4517
01:59:26,881 --> 01:59:27,600
scientist.

4518
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,140
Yeah.

4519
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:28,680
And,

4520
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:29,280
uh,

4521
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,380
people decided that this
is an awesome target.

4522
01:59:31,650 --> 01:59:31,861
Like,

4523
01:59:31,861 --> 01:59:32,690
let's go after it.

4524
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:33,021
Right.

4525
01:59:33,021 --> 01:59:34,140
And to make an example,

4526
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:35,560
which happens on the UN,

4527
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,140
I mean,

4528
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:38,620
the whole people get
shamed on the Internet.

4529
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,340
Now that's,

4530
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:40,550
that's what happens.

4531
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:41,690
Um,

4532
01:59:41,690 --> 01:59:42,523
I mean my,

4533
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:42,980
you know,

4534
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:44,900
I don't have any expertise in this area,

4535
01:59:44,901 --> 01:59:45,734
so it's probably not,

4536
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:46,730
you know,

4537
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:47,830
worth me know

4538
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:48,440
bound.

4539
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:52,310
The official quote he says is strange
as such a chauvinist monitor like me,

4540
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:54,560
has it been asked to
speak to women scientist?

4541
01:59:54,890 --> 01:59:56,900
Let me tell you about
my trouble with girls.

4542
01:59:57,590 --> 01:59:58,700
His trouble with girls,

4543
01:59:58,730 --> 02:00:00,350
three things happen when
they were in the lab.

4544
02:00:00,351 --> 02:00:01,340
You Fall in love with them,

4545
02:00:01,341 --> 02:00:03,650
they fall in love with you
and when you criticize them,

4546
02:00:03,651 --> 02:00:04,101
they cry.

4547
02:00:04,101 --> 02:00:07,280
Perhaps we should make separate
labs for boys and girls now.

4548
02:00:07,281 --> 02:00:08,150
Seriously,

4549
02:00:08,151 --> 02:00:12,350
I'm impressed with the economic
development of a second.

4550
02:00:12,351 --> 02:00:12,930
This was before

4551
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:13,763
not fair.

4552
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:15,560
Of course he,

4553
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:15,990
it was,

4554
02:00:15,990 --> 02:00:17,520
it was him joking.

4555
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:18,911
Yeah.

4556
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:19,661
But he's definitely,

4557
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:20,530
he's joking,

4558
02:00:20,531 --> 02:00:25,180
playing on stereotypes that girls
cry and girls can't handle criticism.

4559
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:25,540
I mean,

4560
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:26,370
I'm just saying,

4561
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,203
yeah,

4562
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:27,940
I,

4563
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:31,630
I'm not gonna say that I
think is totally fine to say,

4564
02:00:31,631 --> 02:00:32,464
hey,

4565
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:33,670
when you say these things,

4566
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:37,690
it might result in some girl thinking,

4567
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:38,583
wait,

4568
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:41,980
maybe I'm not going to be
a good scientist because,

4569
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:46,090
because people say that girls aren't
good in the lab or whatever it is.

4570
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:47,650
I wouldn't say it.

4571
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:48,533
That's yeah,

4572
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:49,713
I wouldn't say it.

4573
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:50,920
I try to be,

4574
02:00:51,130 --> 02:00:51,911
I tried to be,

4575
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:52,121
you know,

4576
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:55,330
even when we say things like
about people who play games a lot,

4577
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:56,260
you know,

4578
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:56,840
um,

4579
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:57,390
oh,

4580
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:58,510
they're wasting their lives.

4581
02:00:58,511 --> 02:00:58,691
You know,

4582
02:00:58,691 --> 02:01:00,130
why don't you go out
and do something real?

4583
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:01,210
Um,

4584
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:03,100
I don't think that's useful to say either.

4585
02:01:03,101 --> 02:01:04,480
I think that that's actually,

4586
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:06,190
uh,

4587
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:08,620
can be really damaging identity.

4588
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:09,591
Generalize,

4589
02:01:09,591 --> 02:01:09,801
you know,

4590
02:01:09,801 --> 02:01:10,090
men,

4591
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:10,640
yes.

4592
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:13,710
And women do that and girls aren't
good at being in the lab and it's,

4593
02:01:13,711 --> 02:01:14,120
it's,

4594
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:14,510
it's,

4595
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:15,321
it's damaging.

4596
02:01:15,321 --> 02:01:20,321
And I think now he understands that
a joke like that as innocent as a,

4597
02:01:20,901 --> 02:01:25,430
he might have intended it to be when
you're reading it in a text form,

4598
02:01:25,431 --> 02:01:27,740
especially in you taking
some of it out of context,

4599
02:01:27,741 --> 02:01:28,574
it can be,

4600
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,800
it can be a offensive,

4601
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:35,480
it can be hurtful for someone
who's considering like how
many girls were reading

4602
02:01:35,481 --> 02:01:38,000
that they were considering a
possible career in science.

4603
02:01:38,001 --> 02:01:38,540
One,

4604
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:40,220
I don't have to with
fucking people like this.

4605
02:01:40,221 --> 02:01:40,761
Like I don't want to,

4606
02:01:40,761 --> 02:01:41,870
I'm not gonna cry in your lab,

4607
02:01:41,871 --> 02:01:42,320
asshole.

4608
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,280
I just want to do work.

4609
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:44,240
I want to be a scientist.

4610
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:44,970
Yeah.

4611
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:48,570
So we don't need to like police
people to have this conversation.

4612
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:49,231
Right.

4613
02:01:49,231 --> 02:01:50,064
You know?

4614
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,420
So

4615
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:56,190
what does that sort of expose
in some ways it exposes a,

4616
02:01:56,940 --> 02:01:57,430
yeah.

4617
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:58,510
Prevalent attitudes,

4618
02:01:59,010 --> 02:01:59,440
um,

4619
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:04,440
that this guy who is this esteemed Nobel
winning scientist has this attitude,

4620
02:02:05,590 --> 02:02:05,831
you know,

4621
02:02:05,831 --> 02:02:08,440
that he thinks it's funny to joke
around about it and they're like,

4622
02:02:08,441 --> 02:02:10,570
even if he's not a sexist or a bad guy,

4623
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:15,700
him making this joke about himself
being some chauvinist monster and it's

4624
02:02:15,701 --> 02:02:16,090
become,

4625
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:19,900
one of the things is because his wife
is a prominent feminist and so he jokes

4626
02:02:19,901 --> 02:02:22,060
around about him being
a chauvinist monster.

4627
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:22,321
Yeah.

4628
02:02:22,321 --> 02:02:22,710
Yeah.

4629
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:23,300
You know?

4630
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:24,190
Well that makes sense.

4631
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:24,940
Yeah.

4632
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:25,870
I mean that's,

4633
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:29,320
it's all out of context and it's all also,

4634
02:02:29,350 --> 02:02:31,000
you're dealing with a guy who's,

4635
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,810
who's real focus is,

4636
02:02:32,811 --> 02:02:33,491
is research,

4637
02:02:33,491 --> 02:02:34,840
not social interaction.

4638
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:35,230
Right.

4639
02:02:35,230 --> 02:02:40,230
He's not like a nuanced speaker is not
a guy who is a carefully considered a

4640
02:02:42,941 --> 02:02:46,690
speaker who gets on stage and thinks
about everything and the impact of all,

4641
02:02:46,691 --> 02:02:46,931
I mean,

4642
02:02:46,931 --> 02:02:47,470
he,

4643
02:02:47,470 --> 02:02:50,320
like we were talking about like the
awkward interaction that people might have

4644
02:02:50,321 --> 02:02:51,154
in college.

4645
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:51,520
Well,

4646
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,090
this guy's awkward interaction is
him being forced to write a speech.

4647
02:02:55,091 --> 02:02:56,830
Like if he did this a bunch of times,

4648
02:02:56,831 --> 02:02:58,600
he'd probably get really way better at it.

4649
02:02:58,601 --> 02:02:59,830
And you have,

4650
02:02:59,831 --> 02:03:02,370
you sat down with him alone in,

4651
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:04,510
you guys were just talking
over a glass of wine.

4652
02:03:04,511 --> 02:03:06,640
Maybe you'd understand how
his brain works better.

4653
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:07,150
Yeah,

4654
02:03:07,150 --> 02:03:08,010
maybe I would have spoke.

4655
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:09,750
Yeah.

4656
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:10,090
If,

4657
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:11,600
if something offends you,

4658
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:15,380
it's more useful to have a conversation
about it then to just start.

4659
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:16,731
Yeah.

4660
02:03:16,731 --> 02:03:18,110
But it's fun to blog and shit.

4661
02:03:18,111 --> 02:03:19,880
All of this guy is this guy,

4662
02:03:19,881 --> 02:03:22,750
he's old and he's white
and he's famous or so.

4663
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:26,960
Well write a book about the neurochemistry
of outrage and because it's,

4664
02:03:27,090 --> 02:03:28,350
it's its own high,

4665
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:29,080
you know,

4666
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:30,220
it's recreational,

4667
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:31,470
recreational outrage.

4668
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:31,601
Yeah.

4669
02:03:31,601 --> 02:03:32,231
Without a doubt.

4670
02:03:32,231 --> 02:03:32,711
A real thing.

4671
02:03:32,711 --> 02:03:32,861
Right?

4672
02:03:32,861 --> 02:03:33,280
Yeah.

4673
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:33,430
Yeah.

4674
02:03:33,430 --> 02:03:37,930
And I think that that's what's going on
in colleges and that people are finding

4675
02:03:38,590 --> 02:03:39,460
when you're in college,

4676
02:03:39,461 --> 02:03:42,400
it's like when you were talking about
the addiction that people have to video

4677
02:03:42,401 --> 02:03:42,701
games.

4678
02:03:42,701 --> 02:03:45,310
And then one of the things that sort of
stimulates that addiction is if you're

4679
02:03:45,311 --> 02:03:47,020
trying to avoid things
in your regular lottery.

4680
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:47,170
Okay.

4681
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:47,531
Well,

4682
02:03:47,531 --> 02:03:48,760
if you're in college,

4683
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:49,150
the,

4684
02:03:49,150 --> 02:03:54,150
the overwhelming anxiety of being a
young person who has gone from being,

4685
02:03:54,850 --> 02:03:55,780
living with their parents,

4686
02:03:55,781 --> 02:03:56,591
going to high school,

4687
02:03:56,591 --> 02:04:00,580
now you're in college and you were just
a couple of years away from the cliff of

4688
02:04:00,581 --> 02:04:01,570
real world,

4689
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:04,780
like you're fucking sliding towards
it and you're trying to define it and

4690
02:04:04,781 --> 02:04:07,870
redefine it and change it
and establish yourself.

4691
02:04:08,170 --> 02:04:11,470
And then along the way comes
things that you can be angry at.

4692
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:11,651
Well,

4693
02:04:11,651 --> 02:04:13,930
you will point your fucking fury.

4694
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:18,520
There are really unmeasured are unbalanced
fury at those things where it doesn't

4695
02:04:18,521 --> 02:04:19,510
necessarily make sense,

4696
02:04:19,690 --> 02:04:22,480
but it makes sense to you because what
you're really doing is you're avoiding

4697
02:04:22,481 --> 02:04:24,620
the adjuncts have social anxiety of,

4698
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:25,211
of,

4699
02:04:25,211 --> 02:04:25,990
of uh,

4700
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:29,770
sexual rejection and all the,

4701
02:04:29,771 --> 02:04:33,790
all the shit that makes a
person feel weird things.

4702
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:36,790
And you channel that
towards micro aggressions.

4703
02:04:36,791 --> 02:04:39,030
Are you that towards someone treat,

4704
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:39,420
you know,

4705
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:42,720
deciding to address you with
a male or a female pronoun.

4706
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:43,261
You know,

4707
02:04:43,261 --> 02:04:43,771
there's like,

4708
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:46,890
there's a lot of weirdness
to being a person and that,

4709
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,670
that,

4710
02:04:47,670 --> 02:04:48,390
but you know,

4711
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:51,410
the last thing I want to
say about this is part,

4712
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:51,871
it is,

4713
02:04:51,871 --> 02:04:55,740
I think people are just trying
to make new roles for the game.

4714
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:56,620
Right.

4715
02:04:56,620 --> 02:04:57,031
You know,

4716
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:57,840
and,

4717
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:01,470
and when you're trying to change the
rules of a game that is really upsetting.

4718
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:02,520
If you're in the middle of the game,

4719
02:05:02,570 --> 02:05:04,380
you're playing a game and stuff is like,

4720
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:05,310
ah,

4721
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:06,060
wait,

4722
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:06,870
totally,

4723
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:07,860
can't do that now.

4724
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:09,091
She,

4725
02:05:09,091 --> 02:05:10,890
we've always been here and she,

4726
02:05:10,891 --> 02:05:11,111
yeah,

4727
02:05:11,111 --> 02:05:11,281
yeah,

4728
02:05:11,281 --> 02:05:11,610
yeah,

4729
02:05:11,610 --> 02:05:11,821
yeah.

4730
02:05:11,821 --> 02:05:12,091
It's like,

4731
02:05:12,091 --> 02:05:12,211
oh,

4732
02:05:12,211 --> 02:05:12,901
you're playing soccer.

4733
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:14,820
You can't kick the ball
anymore with your feet.

4734
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:15,500
Right.

4735
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:16,620
And you're in the middle of the game.

4736
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:17,060
Right,

4737
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:17,370
right.

4738
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:17,671
Right.

4739
02:05:17,671 --> 02:05:17,970
So,

4740
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:20,860
but it doesn't mean as
a game designer was say,

4741
02:05:20,861 --> 02:05:23,580
it doesn't mean that there isn't a
better game that actually could have

4742
02:05:23,581 --> 02:05:24,414
different rules,

4743
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:28,590
but it's really upsetting to be in the
middle of a game and have somebody say,

4744
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:29,190
wait.

4745
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:29,431
Right.

4746
02:05:29,431 --> 02:05:30,264
Those aren't the rules.

4747
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:30,900
So,

4748
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:31,231
you know,

4749
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:32,040
maybe we should,

4750
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:32,970
maybe we should.

4751
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:34,040
Um,

4752
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:34,580
I don't know.

4753
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:37,100
I don't know how to do
it better because I mean,

4754
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:37,521
look,

4755
02:05:37,521 --> 02:05:41,240
I'm a progressive person and I'm glad
that things are changing in society in

4756
02:05:41,241 --> 02:05:42,050
lots of ways,

4757
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:42,411
you know,

4758
02:05:42,411 --> 02:05:43,460
then I'm excited about

4759
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:43,851
like,

4760
02:05:43,851 --> 02:05:44,900
what makes you happy?

4761
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:45,650
What do you,

4762
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:49,060
what do you think is good about the
changes in society in a progressive?

4763
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:49,661
Well,

4764
02:05:49,661 --> 02:05:49,951
I'm,

4765
02:05:49,951 --> 02:05:52,330
I'm really glad that we
have marriage equality now.

4766
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:53,680
I'm really excited about that.

4767
02:05:54,010 --> 02:05:55,090
I'm glad that,

4768
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:55,810
um,

4769
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:58,630
I mean paternity and maternity leave,

4770
02:05:58,660 --> 02:05:58,991
you know,

4771
02:05:58,991 --> 02:06:03,460
becoming more people having
longer maternity leave and
the same length paternity

4772
02:06:03,461 --> 02:06:05,950
leave for dads as a new parent.

4773
02:06:05,951 --> 02:06:06,180
I,

4774
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:06,441
you know,

4775
02:06:06,441 --> 02:06:08,230
really excited to see
companies doing that.

4776
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:08,950
Um,

4777
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:09,580
and I like,

4778
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:10,031
I like,

4779
02:06:10,031 --> 02:06:10,780
you know,

4780
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:11,560
uh,

4781
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:14,290
I like that we're starting to
talk about income inequality.

4782
02:06:14,291 --> 02:06:19,291
I mean optimistic that there will
be changes in that direction.

4783
02:06:19,421 --> 02:06:20,680
And I think that,

4784
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:22,023
uh,

4785
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:25,480
I think the black lives matter
is hugely important movement.

4786
02:06:25,481 --> 02:06:26,201
I think so.

4787
02:06:26,201 --> 02:06:31,201
I think there's a lot of conversations
going on right now where people are angry

4788
02:06:31,241 --> 02:06:34,360
or have struggled or feel like
they've been playing a rigged game.

4789
02:06:34,690 --> 02:06:35,290
And,

4790
02:06:35,290 --> 02:06:35,800
uh,

4791
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:40,570
so it's not as long going to be pleasant
and not all the tactics are going to be

4792
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:42,730
effective or good either.

4793
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:43,893
But,

4794
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:44,550
uh,

4795
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:48,420
the general attitude is definitely
moving in a more progressive direction.

4796
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:49,201
I think so.

4797
02:06:49,201 --> 02:06:49,990
And somebody

4798
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:50,830
who has been,

4799
02:06:51,370 --> 02:06:52,000
you know,

4800
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,271
I've,

4801
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:53,410
I've had Twitter,

4802
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:53,950
you know,

4803
02:06:53,950 --> 02:06:58,240
hordes yelling at me because they thought
that I was breaking one of the new

4804
02:06:58,241 --> 02:06:59,740
rules of how we're supposed to,

4805
02:07:00,220 --> 02:07:01,210
like what did people yell at?

4806
02:07:01,211 --> 02:07:01,760
You know,

4807
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,310
one of the big instance I had was,

4808
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:04,173
uh,

4809
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,133
about,

4810
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:05,620
uh,

4811
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:08,350
my recommendations for
playing tetris after a trauma.

4812
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:12,250
So there've been multiple randomized
control studies now out of Oxford

4813
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:15,820
University showing that if you play tetris
within 24 hours of a traumatic event,

4814
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:18,160
it will reduce the flashbacks.

4815
02:07:18,161 --> 02:07:22,750
You have the severity of flashbacks and
other PTSD symptoms because it occupies

4816
02:07:22,751 --> 02:07:27,020
your brain and prevents your
brain from kind of locking in and,

4817
02:07:27,021 --> 02:07:30,280
and obsessive compulsive
way on the trauma.

4818
02:07:30,370 --> 02:07:30,611
Right?

4819
02:07:30,611 --> 02:07:31,120
So this is,

4820
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:34,630
I think this is incredibly important
advice that everyone should know.

4821
02:07:34,631 --> 02:07:36,190
Kind of like drop and roll.

4822
02:07:36,191 --> 02:07:36,401
You know,

4823
02:07:36,401 --> 02:07:37,390
if you catch on fire,

4824
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,470
you know what to do.

4825
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,340
Everybody should have tetris on their
phone and have it available to them.

4826
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:42,630
If,

4827
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:43,000
if,

4828
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,630
because I know having suffered
flashbacks from my own head injury,

4829
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:47,351
how,

4830
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:50,650
I mean I would have nightmares and beat
of which I was hitting my head and I

4831
02:07:50,651 --> 02:07:51,680
would feel it as if a real,

4832
02:07:51,681 --> 02:07:54,580
and I'd wake up and I'd be convinced that
I had hit my head in the middle of the

4833
02:07:54,581 --> 02:07:57,250
night and was going to have
this experience all over again.

4834
02:07:57,670 --> 02:07:57,940
Um,

4835
02:07:57,940 --> 02:07:59,230
just nightmares constantly.

4836
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:00,970
So I know how bad is
no one people to do it.

4837
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,500
When I started tweeting about it,

4838
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,720
people I got told that there needed to
be like trigger warnings on my tweets

4839
02:08:07,721 --> 02:08:11,710
because I was mentioning Ptsd and I
might make somebody think about like a

4840
02:08:11,711 --> 02:08:14,200
trauma that they experienced and um,

4841
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:15,610
while they're trying to change the game.

4842
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:16,000
Yeah.

4843
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,930
So it's like I under,

4844
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:17,830
I don't,

4845
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:18,221
you know,

4846
02:08:18,221 --> 02:08:18,550
I've,

4847
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:22,330
I've been on the other side of it where
people have said that I'm doing it

4848
02:08:22,331 --> 02:08:23,164
wrong,

4849
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:27,850
but at the same time I recognize there
are people who are suffering or angry or

4850
02:08:27,851 --> 02:08:31,480
they have been at a disadvantage
because of the way the game is rigged.

4851
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:35,980
And so I'm okay with there being like,

4852
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,920
we're all going to be uncomfortable
for awhile as these things change.

4853
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:40,270
And that's,

4854
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,170
you know,

4855
02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:46,170
so you're uncomfortable with being
unjustly accused of being insensitive when

4856
02:08:47,141 --> 02:08:50,980
you're bringing out the
scientific research that
shows that a game can help you

4857
02:08:50,981 --> 02:08:51,730
with trauma.

4858
02:08:51,730 --> 02:08:52,010
Yeah,

4859
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:52,430
I mean,

4860
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:52,900
I,

4861
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:54,110
I think I've,

4862
02:08:54,230 --> 02:08:54,730
I'm,

4863
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:55,940
I'm going to keep doing it,

4864
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:57,193
you know,

4865
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:00,860
but I understand that the people who
say it are hurting the people who,

4866
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:02,520
who are telling me that
I'm triggering them.

4867
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:03,780
So irrational.

4868
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:07,460
I think that all irrational behavior like
that should either be ignored or shit

4869
02:09:07,461 --> 02:09:07,790
on.

4870
02:09:07,790 --> 02:09:08,540
I really do.

4871
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:09,770
I just think it's dangerous.

4872
02:09:09,771 --> 02:09:11,420
I think it's dangerous
when it gets pointed out.

4873
02:09:11,421 --> 02:09:11,960
Like your,

4874
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,650
your science,

4875
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:17,090
you're pointing out the scientific
aspects of a very specific activity that's

4876
02:09:17,091 --> 02:09:18,140
very good for trauma.

4877
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:20,450
And they're saying that you
shouldn't talk about this now.

4878
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:21,650
That's nonsense.

4879
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:21,920
Well,

4880
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,840
that's why I still talk about it.

4881
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:24,200
Right.

4882
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:25,500
But I don't have to get
into a fight with them.

4883
02:09:25,501 --> 02:09:25,850
Yeah.

4884
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:25,941
No,

4885
02:09:25,941 --> 02:09:26,570
you certainly don't.

4886
02:09:26,570 --> 02:09:27,410
You should ignore them.

4887
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:27,710
Right.

4888
02:09:27,710 --> 02:09:28,543
Or Shit on them,

4889
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:29,810
depending on how you feel.

4890
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:30,190
Yeah.

4891
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:32,210
But I think that there's,

4892
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:33,800
there's definitely a,

4893
02:09:33,801 --> 02:09:38,690
I like how we're defining life as like a
giant game or is equal to a giant game.

4894
02:09:38,990 --> 02:09:42,950
Cause I think that that's what's
going on also with the reaction,

4895
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:45,080
the negative reaction
to progressive thinking.

4896
02:09:45,081 --> 02:09:46,010
Now like a,

4897
02:09:46,011 --> 02:09:47,660
I was tweeting something about,

4898
02:09:47,690 --> 02:09:48,470
um,

4899
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:49,730
this woman in,

4900
02:09:49,770 --> 02:09:50,120
uh,

4901
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:54,830
Kentucky that was trying to stop people
from getting gay marriage licenses.

4902
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:55,190
Yeah.

4903
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:55,640
And,

4904
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:56,150
uh,

4905
02:09:56,150 --> 02:09:56,983
I really,

4906
02:09:57,140 --> 02:09:59,990
I took a few days where I wasn't paying
attention to Twitter that much and I

4907
02:09:59,991 --> 02:10:02,870
didn't know that there was this
giant movement supporting this woman.

4908
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:08,090
And I went to Mike Huckabee's fucking
Twitter page and saw that this crazy old

4909
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:12,260
asshole was like saying that
there's a war against Christians.

4910
02:10:12,261 --> 02:10:16,880
And that like Hashtag religious liberty
and so it was like that doesn't have a

4911
02:10:16,910 --> 02:10:20,510
religious liberty doesn't mean you
enforce your religion on other people.

4912
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:20,711
Right.

4913
02:10:20,711 --> 02:10:22,010
But that's so crazy.

4914
02:10:22,011 --> 02:10:24,650
Yeah and there was so much blow back.

4915
02:10:24,651 --> 02:10:28,920
I got so many people tweeting at me
angrily tweeting at me for saying like,

4916
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:33,050
and I tweeted something about Ted Cruz
about how ridiculous his views are on

4917
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:37,220
marriage and like that he's probably gay
and I'm like if you've listened to the

4918
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:37,971
way that guy talks,

4919
02:10:37,971 --> 02:10:39,260
he's super feminine.

4920
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:42,290
Like there's like how many times we
have to see this where these men,

4921
02:10:42,291 --> 02:10:42,620
right?

4922
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:45,260
Because I have a bit that I used to do
my act that there's two types of people

4923
02:10:45,261 --> 02:10:46,250
that hate gay marriage.

4924
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:49,430
It's either you're really dumb or
you're secretly worried the decks are

4925
02:10:49,431 --> 02:10:50,030
delicious.

4926
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:50,840
Those are the people.

4927
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:53,480
And like this guy is like
there's something going on here.

4928
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:57,040
Why does he care so much about
two people that are in love that,

4929
02:10:57,230 --> 02:11:01,940
but watching the people that are angry
that the game is being redefined and

4930
02:11:01,941 --> 02:11:02,750
there was all this,

4931
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:05,210
it was all this Christian
stuff that was attached to it.

4932
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:05,660
Like,

4933
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:05,870
well,

4934
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:06,410
guess what?

4935
02:11:06,410 --> 02:11:09,710
Guess what else it says not to do in
the Bible it says not to get divorced.

4936
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:10,850
Like this lady,

4937
02:11:10,851 --> 02:11:12,950
the same lady has been
divorced three times.

4938
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,180
She's on her fourth marriage.

4939
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:16,490
Guess what else it says you're
not supposed to have tattoos.

4940
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:17,413
Okay.

4941
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:20,120
Those people were tattooed
with religious symbols on them.

4942
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:22,670
You've got a cross on your
arm and you tattooed it.

4943
02:11:22,671 --> 02:11:23,340
She fucking,

4944
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:27,020
you gotta read the whole book like crazy.

4945
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:29,300
Like the things that they choose and it,

4946
02:11:29,301 --> 02:11:29,781
what it is,

4947
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:30,950
is they trying to,

4948
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:34,310
they're trying to define the
world that they're playing in.

4949
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:34,580
Yeah.

4950
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:35,540
We're trying to define right.

4951
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:39,360
And I think it's important because
even though I might disagree,

4952
02:11:39,361 --> 02:11:39,930
I mean I,

4953
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:44,580
I vehemently disagree with people whose
perspective seem to be fueled by hate.

4954
02:11:44,970 --> 02:11:48,360
But I think it's important to still
try to have the empathy or the,

4955
02:11:48,690 --> 02:11:53,370
the mental insight to understand
why does this make them feel so bad?

4956
02:11:53,371 --> 02:11:54,480
I think what you just said,

4957
02:11:54,481 --> 02:11:57,450
and you have the feeling that you
thought you understood the rules.

4958
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:59,730
I mean religion is a set of roles.

4959
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:00,631
You thought you understood it.

4960
02:12:00,631 --> 02:12:00,900
You're,

4961
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:02,670
you're playing the game right.

4962
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:03,810
You're doing it right.

4963
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:04,890
Um,

4964
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:06,000
and it is,

4965
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:11,390
it is psychologically distressing to have
somebody else tell you were playing a

4966
02:12:11,791 --> 02:12:12,520
different game.

4967
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:12,850
Yeah.

4968
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:13,080
You know,

4969
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,010
your game sucks.

4970
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:14,940
Um,

4971
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:16,380
and you're not going to
go to play it anymore.

4972
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:17,543
Uh,

4973
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:18,850
I,

4974
02:12:18,850 --> 02:12:23,850
I try to understand where those feelings
are coming from because if you're going

4975
02:12:24,451 --> 02:12:25,890
to change people's minds,

4976
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:27,150
you know,

4977
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:28,140
you have to,

4978
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,660
I think you have to acknowledge
that they are in a real,

4979
02:12:30,690 --> 02:12:32,670
they are really in distress about this,

4980
02:12:32,671 --> 02:12:32,911
you know,

4981
02:12:32,911 --> 02:12:34,530
then I doing this just to be jerks.

4982
02:12:34,890 --> 02:12:35,723
I mean they,

4983
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:38,370
this is why change is fall to them.

4984
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:38,541
Well,

4985
02:12:38,541 --> 02:12:41,640
why are they in distress about something
that doesn't directly affect them?

4986
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,740
But it's because of what you just said.

4987
02:12:43,741 --> 02:12:44,430
Because it is,

4988
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:44,970
it is,

4989
02:12:44,970 --> 02:12:45,803
it feels,

4990
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:47,060
it's,

4991
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:49,650
they have committed to a framework,

4992
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:50,990
a set of roles and,

4993
02:12:50,991 --> 02:12:51,231
and,

4994
02:12:51,231 --> 02:12:51,750
and,

4995
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:52,500
and put,

4996
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:53,480
that's it.

4997
02:12:53,490 --> 02:12:54,091
Once you're in it,

4998
02:12:54,091 --> 02:12:54,924
you're in it and,

4999
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,531
and you know,

5000
02:12:55,531 --> 02:12:56,311
when you're playing a game,

5001
02:12:56,311 --> 02:12:59,760
you always try to stop the cheaters and
you protect the boundaries of the game.

5002
02:12:59,761 --> 02:12:59,981
That's,

5003
02:12:59,981 --> 02:13:02,370
that's a mindset you get
into and they're just,

5004
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,110
they think they're just doing it.

5005
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:07,730
What kind of country that was
established by Christian values.

5006
02:13:07,731 --> 02:13:08,120
Yes.

5007
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:09,590
The fucking games locked.

5008
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:10,040
Yeah.

5009
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:10,341
Okay.

5010
02:13:10,341 --> 02:13:11,540
You can't change the rules.

5011
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:12,231
That's,

5012
02:13:12,231 --> 02:13:13,650
it really does seem like we've,

5013
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:15,320
we've kind of touched on something here.

5014
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:15,770
Yeah.

5015
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:16,401
This is a,

5016
02:13:16,401 --> 02:13:19,010
this has been a really
good one for me was the,

5017
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:19,220
the,

5018
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:21,020
the overall looking at the,

5019
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:26,260
the whole existence as instead
of defining it by the word game,

5020
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:32,740
but looking at it with almost the same
sort of a attitude or approach that you

5021
02:13:33,061 --> 02:13:37,050
would look at a game is
a very beneficial good.

5022
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:39,120
It's worked for me.

5023
02:13:39,770 --> 02:13:40,100
You can,

5024
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:41,940
your eyes get big like saucers.

5025
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:42,571
Like you,

5026
02:13:42,571 --> 02:13:43,404
like you did it,

5027
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:43,861
you did it,

5028
02:13:43,861 --> 02:13:44,694
you scored,

5029
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:45,840
you made it happen.

5030
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:46,860
Yeah.

5031
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:47,460
I think,

5032
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:47,880
um,

5033
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:48,540
also,

5034
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:49,260
um,

5035
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:49,881
like the,

5036
02:13:49,881 --> 02:13:50,120
the,

5037
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:50,460
the,

5038
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:52,770
the ebb and flow of culture,

5039
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:55,020
like the things that are
seemed to definitely,

5040
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:55,943
even,

5041
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:59,520
even though I resist like this nonsense
about microaggressions and trigger

5042
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:00,630
warnings and stuff like that,

5043
02:14:00,631 --> 02:14:04,690
I'm very happy that things are moving
in the direction of acceptance.

5044
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:05,040
Yeah.

5045
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,030
Very happy that,

5046
02:14:06,031 --> 02:14:06,241
you know,

5047
02:14:06,241 --> 02:14:07,800
like you can be whatever
the fuck you want.

5048
02:14:07,801 --> 02:14:08,910
You just saw you're a woman today.

5049
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:09,391
Go ahead.

5050
02:14:09,391 --> 02:14:10,620
As long as you don't hurt anybody,

5051
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:11,573
who cares?

5052
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:13,050
This guy wants to wear
dresses and you want,

5053
02:14:13,051 --> 02:14:14,310
he wants you to call him Jane now.

5054
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:15,173
Fine.

5055
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:15,990
Okay.

5056
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:16,231
You know,

5057
02:14:16,231 --> 02:14:17,700
these two guys want to
get married to each other.

5058
02:14:17,701 --> 02:14:18,534
Terrific.

5059
02:14:18,570 --> 02:14:18,901
You know,

5060
02:14:18,901 --> 02:14:21,690
these two people want to stop
wearing makeup and they want to,

5061
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:22,650
what do you give a shit?

5062
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:23,400
Who Cares?

5063
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:24,090
Who Cares?

5064
02:14:24,090 --> 02:14:25,520
Or they want to dye their hair blue.

5065
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:26,393
That's fine too.

5066
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:31,490
Like eventually we'll all figure out
that we are all just unique individuals

5067
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:34,850
that are a part of giant,

5068
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:39,950
this gigantic super organism and the
most conducive way or the most harmonic

5069
02:14:40,471 --> 02:14:41,304
way,

5070
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:46,380
harmonious way for us to interact with
each other is to fuck with each other's

5071
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:46,831
path.

5072
02:14:46,831 --> 02:14:50,460
The least whatever path you're
on your way in your game,

5073
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:53,160
as long as it doesn't
negatively affect people.

5074
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:55,650
As long as you're not
a destroyer out there,

5075
02:14:55,651 --> 02:14:57,660
your path is to burn down
to the people's houses.

5076
02:14:57,661 --> 02:14:58,920
Your path is to steal.

5077
02:14:58,921 --> 02:15:00,780
Your path has to to hurt people.

5078
02:15:00,810 --> 02:15:02,160
As long as that's not going on.

5079
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:04,150
Why care and,

5080
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:07,110
and then ultimately once
that is established,

5081
02:15:07,111 --> 02:15:08,850
I think then we will focus on,

5082
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:09,271
okay,

5083
02:15:09,271 --> 02:15:12,000
well what are our rear real
issues are real issues?

5084
02:15:12,001 --> 02:15:13,590
Aren't gay people getting
married to each other?

5085
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:17,040
A real issues are the people that actually
are burning houses down the people

5086
02:15:17,041 --> 02:15:17,860
that are stealing.

5087
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:18,000
Yeah.

5088
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,460
Like these are the real
issues that people have.

5089
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,620
People that are not micro aggressions,

5090
02:15:22,621 --> 02:15:23,730
but actual aggressions.

5091
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:27,450
People that are actually committing
crimes against each other and why are they

5092
02:15:27,451 --> 02:15:28,020
doing that?

5093
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:28,141
Well,

5094
02:15:28,141 --> 02:15:29,340
what is wrong with their game?

5095
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,630
What happened to them?

5096
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:31,181
Like what,

5097
02:15:31,181 --> 02:15:34,180
what series of events have placed
them in this sort of position?

5098
02:15:34,181 --> 02:15:34,270
Yeah,

5099
02:15:34,270 --> 02:15:34,441
yeah,

5100
02:15:34,441 --> 02:15:34,660
yeah.

5101
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:35,411
Because it's not,

5102
02:15:35,411 --> 02:15:36,190
I mean,

5103
02:15:36,190 --> 02:15:38,530
people don't get into that in a vacuum.

5104
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:39,290
No.

5105
02:15:39,290 --> 02:15:41,660
I think that's also something you
realized once you have children.

5106
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:41,960
Yeah.

5107
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:42,950
Like you have now.

5108
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:45,230
And as a father,

5109
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:50,260
one of the things has changed radically
in my life is seeing people now.

5110
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:53,300
Like when I meet people,

5111
02:15:53,301 --> 02:15:56,270
I see them as babies that have grown up.

5112
02:15:56,630 --> 02:15:59,330
Like I don't see them as
being in a static state.

5113
02:15:59,331 --> 02:15:59,840
Yeah.

5114
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:00,500
You know,

5115
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:00,921
and it's,

5116
02:16:00,921 --> 02:16:02,180
it's very strange,

5117
02:16:02,181 --> 02:16:03,440
like even assholes that,

5118
02:16:03,441 --> 02:16:03,831
I mean,

5119
02:16:03,831 --> 02:16:04,940
I'd look at them and even go,

5120
02:16:04,941 --> 02:16:06,020
that guy's a fucking asshole.

5121
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:07,640
I think of them as like,

5122
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:10,100
what happened to that person?

5123
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:10,750
But you know,

5124
02:16:10,750 --> 02:16:11,583
that's like a,

5125
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:16,670
that's I practice Zen Buddhism and
that's like one of the big Buddhist

5126
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,730
meditations is to
picture people as babies.

5127
02:16:19,870 --> 02:16:20,360
Yeah.

5128
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:21,920
When you feel hate for somebody,

5129
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:26,780
try to visualize them all the way down
to throw little baby self and picture

5130
02:16:26,781 --> 02:16:30,430
what they look like as a baby and to
think about who they were when they were

5131
02:16:30,431 --> 02:16:33,940
that baby before all of
life happened to them,

5132
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:38,800
to make them into somebody
that has now triggered these,

5133
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:39,221
you know,

5134
02:16:39,221 --> 02:16:40,960
hate feelings of anger

5135
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:42,860
in the womb.

5136
02:16:42,890 --> 02:16:43,160
You know,

5137
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:47,840
I was talking to Michael Irvin famous
pro football player who's talking to me

5138
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:52,640
about kids that grow up
in horrible environments,

5139
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:56,930
dangerous volatile environments where
the mother has all this cortisol in her

5140
02:16:56,931 --> 02:17:01,931
brain while the child in the womb and
that the kid literally grows up like with

5141
02:17:02,271 --> 02:17:03,200
a short temper.

5142
02:17:03,230 --> 02:17:03,440
Yeah.

5143
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:04,260
They literally,

5144
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:05,960
they're developed out of the womb,

5145
02:17:05,961 --> 02:17:08,750
like constantly worried
about stress and danger.

5146
02:17:08,751 --> 02:17:09,190
Yeah.

5147
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:10,080
Hypervigilant.

5148
02:17:10,170 --> 02:17:10,600
Yeah.

5149
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:11,130
All of that.

5150
02:17:11,130 --> 02:17:12,300
I've had feral cats.

5151
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:14,850
I had a cat that was feral
at her raised and uh,

5152
02:17:14,851 --> 02:17:19,851
he was fucking terrified of everything
from the time he was a baby and a,

5153
02:17:20,110 --> 02:17:22,830
I've locked myself in a room with them
when he was a kitten because there's the

5154
02:17:22,831 --> 02:17:23,970
only way like bond with him.

5155
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:25,080
I stayed with him for like three,

5156
02:17:25,081 --> 02:17:28,560
I just put a bunch of books in the room
and cat food and the litter box and be

5157
02:17:28,561 --> 02:17:28,711
like,

5158
02:17:28,711 --> 02:17:29,101
you and me,

5159
02:17:29,101 --> 02:17:29,241
dude,

5160
02:17:29,241 --> 02:17:30,980
we're hanging out and
want to come near him.

5161
02:17:30,981 --> 02:17:31,814
And he'd be like,

5162
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:35,310
he just jumped on the walls and like
you'd never seen anything like a feral

5163
02:17:35,311 --> 02:17:35,910
kitten.

5164
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:38,370
I mean he was really little
to just a couple months old.

5165
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:39,460
And uh,

5166
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:39,640
when,

5167
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:39,900
uh,

5168
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:41,570
when I would get to them and pick them up.

5169
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:41,730
Right.

5170
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:44,160
He was talking [inaudible]
like finally somebody loves me.

5171
02:17:44,990 --> 02:17:45,823
Like,

5172
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:47,340
but then when you put them down,

5173
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:49,960
like the same cat would just be,

5174
02:17:49,970 --> 02:17:50,340
yeah,

5175
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:54,210
because his brain was programmed
from the time he was a little baby.

5176
02:17:54,230 --> 02:17:54,570
Yeah.

5177
02:17:54,570 --> 02:17:56,160
And there was not a lot he could do.

5178
02:17:56,161 --> 02:17:57,930
I couldn't say that cat's ass asshole.

5179
02:17:58,140 --> 02:17:58,291
Well,

5180
02:17:58,291 --> 02:17:58,441
no,

5181
02:17:58,441 --> 02:18:00,750
that fucking cat was born
under an apartment building,

5182
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:01,321
you know,

5183
02:18:01,321 --> 02:18:04,530
and his mom was like running away
from traffic and trying to eat rats or

5184
02:18:04,531 --> 02:18:05,610
whatever the fuck they could kill.

5185
02:18:05,710 --> 02:18:06,220
Yeah.

5186
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:06,341
Well,

5187
02:18:06,341 --> 02:18:09,840
I think this is one of the reasons why
game thinking is so powerful because you,

5188
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:12,660
this is zoom out and see the
bigger structure that it's,

5189
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:12,940
it's,

5190
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:17,590
there's always a bigger game and more
pieces in play and you're getting other

5191
02:18:17,591 --> 02:18:18,220
people's,

5192
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:18,551
you know,

5193
02:18:18,551 --> 02:18:20,270
strategies or actions or,

5194
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,233
you know,

5195
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:23,313
or the rules,

5196
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,100
you know,

5197
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:24,550
um,

5198
02:18:24,550 --> 02:18:28,060
and being able to zoom out
and see that makes you feel,

5199
02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:30,550
I think will you have more perspective,

5200
02:18:30,551 --> 02:18:33,310
more wisdom and maybe more
compassion for other people.

5201
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:33,931
That's awesome.

5202
02:18:33,931 --> 02:18:37,230
Why people like to rightly so criticized,

5203
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:38,190
very narrow minded,

5204
02:18:38,191 --> 02:18:39,540
small town thinking.

5205
02:18:39,570 --> 02:18:39,870
Yeah.

5206
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:41,640
Small little environments,

5207
02:18:41,641 --> 02:18:43,710
insulated environments that are very,

5208
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:44,760
you know,

5209
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:47,280
very critic criticizing or very,

5210
02:18:47,281 --> 02:18:47,491
you know,

5211
02:18:47,491 --> 02:18:47,791
just to,

5212
02:18:47,791 --> 02:18:48,690
just to have their,

5213
02:18:48,691 --> 02:18:52,890
their way set and they don't have a wide
variety of experiences they can draw

5214
02:18:52,891 --> 02:18:56,860
upon or they don't have a broad
nuanced view of the board that there,

5215
02:18:56,861 --> 02:18:56,970
yeah.

5216
02:18:56,970 --> 02:18:57,630
Playing on.

5217
02:18:57,630 --> 02:18:58,440
Yeah.

5218
02:18:58,440 --> 02:18:59,273
So this is like,

5219
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:03,030
this is giving me a lot of
what a food for thought about.

5220
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:03,391
I mean,

5221
02:19:03,391 --> 02:19:06,720
the links between social
change and gainful thinking.

5222
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:08,930
Yeah.

5223
02:19:08,930 --> 02:19:09,681
There's something there.

5224
02:19:09,681 --> 02:19:13,030
I think also as time is going on and uh,

5225
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:14,030
this is one thing,

5226
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:14,240
the,

5227
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:19,210
the positive aspects of social media
and of the Internet itself is that we're

5228
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:23,450
getting more and more information instead
of just accepting these preconceived

5229
02:19:23,451 --> 02:19:25,610
notions that we have about
different groups of people.

5230
02:19:25,880 --> 02:19:28,580
Now we're being to so much data,

5231
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:33,610
it's just inadvertently or a inarguably
changing the way we view those groups

5232
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:39,170
and that you are forced to like when you
see like this black lives matter thing,

5233
02:19:39,171 --> 02:19:42,380
you see all these peaceful protests
where these people are talking eloquently

5234
02:19:42,410 --> 02:19:44,780
speaking and showing video after video,

5235
02:19:44,781 --> 02:19:45,830
police brutality.

5236
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:46,670
And then I've had,

5237
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:51,050
I had a cop on Michael Wood who was a
Baltimore retired Baltimore police officer

5238
02:19:51,051 --> 02:19:51,950
that talked about,

5239
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:56,360
very openly talked about
the institutionalized racism
and about how they had

5240
02:19:56,361 --> 02:20:01,361
found a papers from the 1970s that we're
describing how to behave in certain

5241
02:20:01,671 --> 02:20:04,370
environments that were exactly
the same as what's going on now.

5242
02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:04,671
He's like,

5243
02:20:04,671 --> 02:20:05,960
this is a fucking system.

5244
02:20:06,300 --> 02:20:07,930
This is the,

5245
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:10,670
I don't think that attitude
existed just a few years ago.

5246
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:13,300
People are looking at all
that data now and they go,

5247
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:18,260
it's slowly coming around and
even the hard liners are dropping.

5248
02:20:18,290 --> 02:20:18,531
You know,

5249
02:20:18,531 --> 02:20:21,890
if they were at a 10 now
they're at an a or a seven,

5250
02:20:21,891 --> 02:20:22,940
well I fucking kid,

5251
02:20:22,941 --> 02:20:25,130
you need to get all caught
a school or something.

5252
02:20:25,131 --> 02:20:25,371
You know,

5253
02:20:25,371 --> 02:20:30,371
it's like everyone is sort of slowly
recognizing the pieces that are in play.

5254
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:33,500
It's a lot more complicated
then we want to,

5255
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:33,951
you know,

5256
02:20:33,951 --> 02:20:36,470
just narrowly sort of
define them and these,

5257
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:40,010
these really simplistic
terms where it's not simple.

5258
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:44,090
There's a series of interactions that
are going on all over the globe are human

5259
02:20:44,091 --> 02:20:45,740
beings are trying to find their way.

5260
02:20:45,741 --> 02:20:49,970
And they're also realizing somewhere
along the line that their parents weren't

5261
02:20:49,971 --> 02:20:51,950
these all knowing creatures.

5262
02:20:51,951 --> 02:20:53,240
Neither were their parents,

5263
02:20:53,241 --> 02:20:56,930
neither were the President
Roosevelt or fucking Abe Lincoln.

5264
02:20:57,110 --> 02:21:00,080
They were all people that were
trying to find their way as well.

5265
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:01,670
And this is a group effort.

5266
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,720
It's a group effort that's still going
on and it's not even remotely done.

5267
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:06,830
It's not even close.

5268
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:07,470
Yeah.

5269
02:21:07,470 --> 02:21:07,871
So it's okay.

5270
02:21:07,871 --> 02:21:09,640
So instead of seeing the bigger picture,
