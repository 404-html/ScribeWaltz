1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,430
Push the sucker right up.
Close three,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,150
two,
one.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,760
And we're live.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,750
What's happening man?
How are Ya?

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,650
I'm cool man.
There in La to meet you in person.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,740
I've seen in magazines seen you since 
man.

7
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:22,741
But like when,
when did you first burst onto the 

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:22,741
bodybuilding scene?
What year was that?

9
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:23,560
Oh,
is it reminiscent today?

10
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:27,010
First Time I came out here was 1992 
golds gym.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So I came from UK to do my first 
professional bodybuilding contests was 

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,931
called night of champions in New York 
and I got second place there and made a 

13
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:41,221
real big impact.
And the weeder company that used to be 

14
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,951
based out here with a flex magazine and 
muscle and fitness right down the 

15
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:43,951
street.
They used to be.

16
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,260
I don't think they are now.

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,570
Closed down.
There's a fence around it and 

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,570
everything,
but that's,

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,570
that's less than a mile away from here.

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,570
Yeah.
The,

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,820
the weeder officers are out there and 
you know,

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,980
we though it was a,
it was a big name and bodybuilding,

23
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:57,170
the magazines and everything.
So they flew me out here,

24
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,040
did my first photo shoot at Gold's gym?
Nineteen 90.

25
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,000
So 27

26
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,720
and I remember watching you in those 
magazines.

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,400
You were the first guy,
well,

28
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:12,401
you know what were the first guy,
but you were one of the first guys that 

29
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:12,401
I ever saw in a magazine that it was 
like,

30
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,580
gee,
how the fuck is that a person?

31
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,080
You were so big,
man Christ you were big.

32
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,670
That's funny.
Okay.

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,920
Because I look back at some of the 
pitches now me and I say what the fuck,

34
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,450
you know,
it's um,

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,660
and I came into the sport and I wanted 
to see what I could do.

36
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,700
I want it to like take it as far as it 
could take it,

37
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:34,980
you know?

38
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,270
Well,
you represented to me as an outsider 

39
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,730
looking in this insane determination,
you know,

40
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,950
like I've,
I felt like all the best guys,

41
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:45,680
whether it was arnold or you or Lee 
Haney,

42
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,860
all the top guys,
they always represented not just like 

43
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,630
the biggest and the most profoundly 
ridiculously muscular bodybuilders,

44
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,120
but also this extreme dedication that 
was required to reach that level.

45
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,960
Been around minute with martial arts and
everything.

46
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,570
And it kind of sport is the same thing.
What separates the guy that's first from

47
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,350
second,
from third or whatever,

48
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,740
you know,
you all got certain physical 

49
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:13,840
characteristics that help you in your 
sport and so on.

50
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,380
So you're all gifted up there.
So what can separate the guy from first 

51
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,600
and second and third?
It's,

52
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,040
it's all up there.
That's,

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,730
that's the key.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How did you develop your mindset?
Was it something that you always had or 

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,520
was it something that you developed as 
you were training?

56
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,020
I think there's something already 
already had and I kind of left home when

57
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:37,021
I was 16,
so it was out on my own on the street 

58
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:37,021
and uh,
you know,

59
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,410
you're either going to get smart and,
you know,

60
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,450
look after yourself or you're going 
gonna fall down.

61
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,480
There's nobody there to catch me.
So that was there from a,

62
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,480
from an early age I think.
And uh,

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I was just very determined to,
to this thing that I will be good at in 

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,570
order to change my life and change,
you know,

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,870
uh,
the projection of my life for the people

66
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,790
around me.
Um,

67
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,960
I always grew up on a housing estate in 
the UK.

68
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,220
I no education,

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,430
I was in a jail when I was 18,
so I had all that.

70
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,330
That was,
you know,

71
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,980
the people around me.
I was like,

72
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:10,981
I didn't want part of that future.
I wanted to do something else and I got 

73
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:12,070
this thing that was good at,
so I'm going to take it and run with it,

74
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:17,071
you know,
it's crazy how many people have similar 

75
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,801
stories like that where they were in 
just a terrible environment and they 

76
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:23,101
realized that they had a tough enough,
they had a smart enough and they had to 

77
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:23,860
get out of there and if not for those 
terrible situations,

78
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,070
who knows if they would have ever 
reached the levels of greatness that 

79
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,070
they can tell you from our point of 
view,

80
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,930
I don't think I would have done because 
I would be too comfortable.

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,240
If you're comfortable,
you're not going to put yourself through

82
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,450
that extreme kind of pressure and pain.

83
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,890
And uh,
you know,

84
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,350
I wanted to improve my life,
changed my life and uh,

85
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,130
through the sport.
Here I am sitting talking to you on this

86
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,480
show.
People are listening to me.

87
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,570
I've been all around the world thanks to
my sport.

88
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,580
So it's been great for me.
You know,

89
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,680
when you meet current bodybuilders,
are they like,

90
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,580
hey man,
what the fuck?

91
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,610
I couldn't be.
Not a gigantic huge Mr Hawkins your 

92
00:03:59,610 --> 00:03:59,610
regular size athletic looking dude.
Yeah.

93
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,100
Not really.
Maybe some of the younger guys that are 

94
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,100
coming into this now,
but you know,

95
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,240
people know me.
Um,

96
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,850
I was a professional bodybuilder.
That's what I did and I was the best at 

97
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,571
doing that,
but that kind of training and that kind 

98
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:15,880
of physique is not going to serve me 
now.

99
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,150
So I do training to be more functional.
My goals are more health related now.

100
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,510
Whereas before I was a young guy and I 
want it to be the best at this thing I 

101
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,510
was doing.

102
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,720
I put everything into that.
Um,

103
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,160
but you know,
that kind of physique.

104
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,160
It's not practical for everyday usage.
You know,

105
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,830
how to tie my shoelaces when it was 300 
pounds.

106
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,910
I'm sure.
Man.

107
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,440
And how tall are you?
Five.

108
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:38,890
10,
five,

109
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,520
11,
five.

110
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,560
11.
So like when you were that big,

111
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,710
you were just a ball of muscle.
Just a mass.

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,600
Yeah.
And 300 pounds.

113
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,950
I was 300,
3:10

114
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:52,420
in the off seasons.
Christ competing to 65,

115
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:56,700
but I mean to 65.
Lean as fuck the hydrated,

116
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,270
you know,
shared it.

117
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,310
So yeah,
that's,

118
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,160
that's all I did.
That was all I did.

119
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,860
I trained,
I eat asleep.

120
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,220
I studied.
That's just my mental focus was like 

121
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,710
lasered on that thing that was doing 
nothing else.

122
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,980
I wouldn't go to the movies,
I wouldn't go to dinner if I got home 

123
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:16,980
after 11 because I got to be in a bed at
11.

124
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,530
That was,
that was the regime that are live for,

125
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:24,531
for many years and that's why I was able
to beat other people that maybe it could

126
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,930
be argued they were more gifted than me,
but they weren't willing to do that.

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,670
So that's,
that's what it's all about.

128
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,560
Yeah.
That's what I had always read about you.

129
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:33,850
And that's what I did.
Like I said,

130
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,020
there was the impression that I always 
got like,

131
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:39,670
what you represented is the pinnacle of 
extreme dedication.

132
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,350
Yeah.
And study,

133
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,000
you know,
um,

134
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,130
we had no internet then.
Everybody's got coaches now and 

135
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,491
nutritionists.
The thing that appealed to me is this 

136
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,880
was an individual thing.
I had to learn about the training,

137
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,910
had to learn about the nutrition,
how to learn all this stuff myself.

138
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,940
And that was,
apart from the training,

139
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,540
that was part of it as well,
you know,

140
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,050
the learning part of it I enjoyed.

141
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,370
Was it hard to get good information 
because I'm sure there's a bunch of like

142
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,530
gym experts,
there's always these bro science guys 

143
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:08,530
that are hanging around giving you 
shitty advice,

144
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,881
like how hard was it to get the proper 
information when it came to the 

145
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:14,950
training.
I kind of sifted through it and uh,

146
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,420
was very influenced by a guy called 
Arthur Jones.

147
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:22,421
Don't know if you've heard of him,
but off Jones he invented the Nautilus 

148
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:22,421
machines.
And uh,

149
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,300
this guy was like a billionaire self 
made billionaire who's just was 

150
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,630
fascinated with the bodybuilding but had
no business interest in it.

151
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,240
So he just wanted to know.
He studied it and it was like,

152
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,460
what is it that causes muscle growth?
What is it?

153
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,580
And um,
he found it was the intensity of 

154
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,730
exercise and then there was another 
bodybuilder might men,

155
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,820
so went to compete in the Mr Olympia 
when the Mr Universe,

156
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,080
he took those principles and who used 
them and so I read all this stuff and it

157
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,540
was very logical,
it made sense.

158
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,140
And then I try to own the gym and it 
worked in the gym and if I trained more 

159
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,290
often or if I did more in the gym,
my progress was slow down or stop.

160
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,800
As soon as I cut back and I made the 
workout shorter and more intense,

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,920
my progress went.
So it was for me,

162
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:11,921
it was pretty early on.
I learned how to train properly and 

163
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,830
that's why I was competing.
I competed on a world championship after

164
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,620
18 months training,
which is pretty much unheard of.

165
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,710
That is pretty much unheard of now.
When you say shorter,

166
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:21,230
more intense workouts,
how did you regulate that?

167
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,660
Like that is,
that's a huge issue with martial artists

168
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,470
is overtraining or they want to do more 
work than everybody else.

169
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,290
They want to work harder than everybody 
else and they want a break in their body

170
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,940
down and showing up for the fight.

171
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,370
Exhausted.
Overtraining is a big thing.

172
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:39,371
Yeah,
and if you see the process for muscle 

173
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:40,070
growth is you go in the gym and it put 
stress on the muscle.

174
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:43,700
If you put stress that is not used to,
then it's going to react.

175
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:46,070
You're going to get growth,
but you need to recover from that first.

176
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
You don't go to the gym and grow and 
then recover later.

177
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,410
That's the way it works.
You Go,

178
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,390
if you've,
you know,

179
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,610
you give your body some stresses not 
used to,

180
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,460
you'll get a reaction,
but before we get the reaction,

181
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:01,190
you have to recover.
So if you're not allowing enough time to

182
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,150
recover,
you're just.

183
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
I use this analogy,
a seminars I do.

184
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,010
It's very simplistic,
but it gets the point across.

185
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,460
If you get a bit of sandpaper and you 
rub it across the palm of your hand and 

186
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:12,460
it's kind of bloody.

187
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,660
If you leave it and let it heal up,
what's going to happen?

188
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,330
The skin's gonna develop back a little 
bit stronger,

189
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,390
a little bit thicker than before because
it wants to protect against that stress.

190
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,930
So that's the process,
but if you go and you might get hand 

191
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,020
bloody and before it's healed up again,
you're going and rub it again.

192
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,450
What's happening?
You're not really getting any way.

193
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,980
Just going to have a bloody hand.
You know,

194
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,530
you think you're being tough,
but you're actually just being silly.

195
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,900
Yeah.
And it's a why are you going to the gym?

196
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,940
Right?
I'm going to the gym to get results,

197
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:42,941
so I'm going to do whatever it takes to 
get results and if it means training 30 

198
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,030
minutes once a week or it means training
10 hours a day every day,

199
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,330
whatever it takes.
I was willing to do it and I would have 

200
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,281
done it,
but I'm training 10 hours a day is not 

201
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:51,590
going to build your muscle.
It's just going to burn out.

202
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:56,130
So I was doing average 40 5:50
minute workouts probably four times

203
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,040
a week.
And everybody say,

204
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,750
oh,
that's it.

205
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,270
Whether I write on a piece of paper,
what the fuck is that?

206
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:03,990
That's nothing,
man.

207
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,010
I'm like,
okay,

208
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,070
well come and do it.
Come and do it and tell me if you want 

209
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,100
to do more when we're finished and 
nobody has ever said,

210
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,420
oh,
please come and do some more.

211
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,920
They're like,
that's it.

212
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,230
That's enough because every set by the 
warmup sets you've got to warm up and,

213
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,950
you know,
to be safe and everything.

214
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,570
But the set,
the real sets,

215
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:26,571
so I call them,
we're going to go to absolute failure 

216
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,990
and even beyond with forced reps,
with assistant as reps,

217
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,500
maybe extra negative reps,
which is,

218
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,510
um,
something that most people neglect when 

219
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,510
they lift weights,
they think,

220
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:35,510
you know,
I've lifted it.

221
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,750
All right,
well let it go down.

222
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,110
I've lifted it,
but they're neglecting the lowering part

223
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,130
of the weight and the negative.

224
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,200
So I get people to really slow that 
down.

225
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:48,201
So you're taxing that part as well.
And even at the end of the sit on some 

226
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:48,810
exercises with machines where it's 
practical.

227
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,380
So you know,
you can't curl anymore physically on the

228
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:53,640
positive,
on the contraction,

229
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,710
what your strength on the lowering is 
greater.

230
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,711
So if you did curls and you failed,
I could lift the weight to the top for 

231
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:01,800
you and you could lower it down for 
probably another three Reps.

232
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,180
so if you'd just gone to failure here,
you wouldn't have exhausted the negative

233
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,100
part of the Rep.
so my thing is the exhaust,

234
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:09,450
everything,
it's totally fucked.

235
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,250
You can't live,
you can't lower it,

236
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:16,251
you can't lift it,
it's total failure if you do that once 

237
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:18,150
and an exercise and then time to move on
to another exercise.

238
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,400
How did you develop your protocol?
Just trial and error.

239
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,180
Trial and error.
And you know,

240
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,100
I didn't invent this system of training 
as I said,

241
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,420
people there before me,
Arthur Jones might mentor,

242
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:32,421
I just taught what they did and refined 
it a little bit more for a competitive 

243
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,170
bodybuilder because Arthur Jones wasn't 
competitive bodybuilder.

244
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:39,171
People who trained weren't so his,
his routines were even briefer than 

245
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:39,360
mine.
But for a bodybuilder,

246
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:39,960
you know,
you've got,

247
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,850
you've got to work the side,
Dell,

248
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,350
you've got to work different aspects.
So,

249
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,700
uh,
I'd probably did a little bit more than 

250
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:48,700
they did.
Um,

251
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:48,700
so I adapted it to myself and my needs

252
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,850
now when you were at your height and 
when you're 265 pounds shredded and 

253
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,751
dehydrated and then 310 pounds in the 
off season you got,

254
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,910
it must be like used to looking at 
yourself like that.

255
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,500
Like was it hard to adapt to being me?
You still obviously a very fit guy,

256
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,770
but you're a normal size.
Like if I saw you I'd be like there's a 

257
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:10,770
normal fit guy.
Yup.

258
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,350
That's what I want to be in A.
I'm not training for bodybuilding 

259
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,950
because it's not what I want to do now.
Plus I got a lot of injuries from a low 

260
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:18,950
super heavyweight.
So I did,

261
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,631
I got a torn rotator cuff which is not.
I've tried out a couple of surgeries on 

262
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,530
that doesn't repair.
So you know,

263
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:30,531
I was trying to lift weights and 
continue to do and what I do because 

264
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:30,531
that's what I'm used to doing.
Right,

265
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:35,140
right.
And when you're familiar with doing 

266
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,140
something that you're reluctant to 
change to something else,

267
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,090
but I noticed my shoulder is getting a 
bit worse and my hips were getting,

268
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,290
you know,
I'm like,

269
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,870
hold on,
is this serving me now?

270
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,780
Why am I doing this?
Am I doing this just to try and maintain

271
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:48,960
something for other people what they 
think I should look like?

272
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,170
And I kind of came to the conclusion,
yeah you are because you're not,

273
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,340
you're not a bodybuilder in the morning,
not competing.

274
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,910
So if during this training is not really
benefit and humans maybe making your 

275
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,650
injuries worse,
you know,

276
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:03,070
when,
when you're 60 or something,

277
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,100
you're going to like lift your arms up 
or something like that.

278
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,420
So I'm thinking more practically.
And um,

279
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,080
I started doing yoga and I really fell 
in love with it.

280
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:14,980
It's amazing,
isn't it?

281
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:15,910
Yeah,
it's amazing.

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,380
It's physically,
it's amazing.

283
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,140
I got much more range of motion mobility
and then you've got the spiritual aspect

284
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,340
of as well.
So I'm actually the.

285
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,850
I was inspired to do yoga from a DMT 
trip predator,

286
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,770
a dmt trip.
And I came back and I was like,

287
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,350
my body's all fucked up this thing,
right?

288
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,710
Like I gotta fix some stuff here.
What should I do?

289
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:42,010
And I didn't even,
I vaguely knew what yoga was,

290
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,900
but I didn't really know what it was.
And I got to do something.

291
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:46,750
Got To do yoga or Tai Chee,
I don't know what it is,

292
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,110
but I started looking into it and then 
found a yoga teacher.

293
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:52,840
And I do that a couple times a week.
I find it's great.

294
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,960
Every time I do it I just think I should
do more on this morning.

295
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:58,240
And I got up this morning and did yoga 
class at 8:00,

296
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,420
Gold's gym and you know,
on an empty stomach,

297
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,570
just had some water and some tea and I 
fucking feel amazing or that from that.

298
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,480
Well,
it just,

299
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,390
to me it feels like it connects 
everything.

300
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,810
It connects all the tissue from the back
to the legs to the arms and the neck and

301
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,660
the core.
It strengthens all the connecting stuff.

302
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,880
Yeah.
And you get a flow going around.

303
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,320
That's the thing with bodybuilding,
because bodybuilding,

304
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,960
you're isolating the muscles right?
So you're isolating your bicep,

305
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:31,961
you're isolating the tricep,
isolating the deltoids and putting 

306
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,000
stress on those muscles to maximize the 
muscle size of those individual muscles,

307
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,230
which is great for bodybuilding.
But uh,

308
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,840
your body's function like that,
you know,

309
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,850
if you throw something,
you throw a punch or you know,

310
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,050
you don't use one muscle,
use the sea,

311
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,240
you know,
sits chain affects your whole body,

312
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,730
works together and bodybuilding.
You don't really do that,

313
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:55,090
you don't learn to do that.
So that's what I've had to relearn,

314
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,830
you know.
So when you exercise today,

315
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,050
like what kind of stuff do you do 
besides yoga?

316
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,140
I do yoga a do some cycling.
I live in Spain,

317
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,170
we've got some good hills there.
So I do because I like to push them and 

318
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:07,170
I can't push the whites anymore.

319
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,320
I can't get in that zone,
you know,

320
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:11,080
because because of my injuries,
so I got to do something else.

321
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,930
Yoga is a challenge,
you know?

322
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,940
And it continued to be like if I do that
until I'm dropped down dead 80 years 

323
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,570
old,
there's always more that I can do.

324
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,590
You know,
you can always do a bit more range or a 

325
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:24,590
bit more difficult pose.
So there's no,

326
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:24,990
there's no ceiling there,
you know,

327
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,320
uh,
with the bodybuilding I already been on 

328
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,320
the ceiling.
Yeah.

329
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,320
You know,
um,

330
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
I do cycling couple of times a week up 
and down the hill,

331
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:33,690
so that's like,
you know,

332
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,670
it's got almost like intervals because 
you do a hill,

333
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,350
it's intense and then you go flat and 
it's a bit easier.

334
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,110
So I enjoy doing that.
You move to Spain?

335
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Um,
well I lived in UK and I started 

336
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,370
visiting Spain because in Spain,
the south coast of Spain.

337
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,580
He's got a very brick,
a British community there and the 

338
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,180
weather is amazing.
It's like La Mar Bayer is like,

339
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,550
for me it reminds me a lot of la,
but a mini la without all the bullshit 

340
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,530
and the traffic about the crime and all 
that kind of stuff.

341
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,660
Uh,
so that's why,

342
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,970
that's why I moved there.
Oh,

343
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,980
that's nice.
Have you ever looked into anything for 

344
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:11,980
your shoulder,
like stem cells or things on them?

345
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:11,980
No,
I had,

346
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,240
um,
there was a new surgery now because what

347
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:19,241
happened,
I tore my supraspinatus a couple of 

348
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,740
times and because the end was badly 
frayed there to chop off the end,

349
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,920
so now it doesn't really bridge the gap 
to the Humerus,

350
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,220
so it needs a bridge and apparently 
there's a new surgery that they can,

351
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,110
uh,
make a bridge now.

352
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,250
Um,
but I went to see a surgeon and he's 

353
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,250
like,
okay,

354
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,250
what's three issues here?

355
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,600
Pain,
you have pain.

356
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,170
I'm like,
no,

357
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,910
I'm not really have range of motion.
Actually I got more range than the other

358
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:43,610
shoulder was a bit loose.
Um,

359
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,210
so the only issue with mine is strength 
and stability and he wasn't able to give

360
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:53,030
me 100 percent on whether the surgery 
would do that for me.

361
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,900
And I've had a bad six surgeries.
I had a tendon reattachment here about 

362
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,570
three on the shoulder,
had the hips and I'm like,

363
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,820
you know what,
unless you're going to tell me a hundred

364
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,820
percent that going through the 
inconvenience and pain of a surgery is 

365
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,360
going to give me what I need,
then I'm not going to do it.

366
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm just going to cope with this and I 
can't venture risk,

367
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,260
but so what,
like,

368
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,550
you know,
it doesn't really matter that much to 

369
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:17,550
me.
You can,

370
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,811
you do pushups or I can do some pushups 
but probably like 10 where before I'd do

371
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,680
like 100 or something so it's very 
weakened in stable.

372
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,570
So yeah,
if.

373
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:26,020
Sure,
if,

374
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,890
if I had a surgeon that says to me,
listen man,

375
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,130
we're going to do this and I guarantee 
your shoulders going to be stronger and 

376
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,951
more stable after it because you know,
you've got to sit with you in a sling 

377
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,170
for like six to eight weeks.
You can't shower properly,

378
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,030
can't dress and in and all this stuff.
So for me to go through that again,

379
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,740
I would have to have like,
yeah,

380
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:45,960
this is definitely going to help.
Then I would consider it until then I'll

381
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,910
live with it.
You know,

382
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,670
they're doing some pretty amazing stuff 
now with stem cells.

383
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,460
Yeah,
there with some tendon tissue.

384
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:52,790
So

385
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,060
yeah,
they can do a lot of soft tissue 

386
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,060
regeneration.
They're also doing it now.

387
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,691
The most recent things.
They're combining stem cells with 

388
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:04,210
platelet rich plasma that doing it 
together and they found that by doing 

389
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,351
the stem cells in the prp together,
it helps generate new tissue growth 

390
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,351
better.

391
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,351
Yeah.
No,

392
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,030
my wife,
she had a knee surgery and she had the 

393
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,030
PRP and the recovery was real quick.
So yeah,

394
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,240
it's nice it she had meniscus,
is that what it was?

395
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:14,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

396
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,820
So yeah,
if there's any surgeons out there that 

397
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,230
repair Dorian's shortened supraspinatus,
let me know,

398
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:21,410
man.

399
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,670
Now is your situation very similar to 
what a lot of bodybuilders face after 

400
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:28,420
they retire?
They just,

401
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:32,110
they're so much stress and strain on the
joints in the back and.

402
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,210
Yeah.
Well I'm Ronnie Coleman,

403
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:39,211
who is the Mr Olympia after me and he 
said be serious.

404
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,860
He did a lot of really heavy squatting,
which also when he was getting ready for

405
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:46,990
a bodybuilding competition and basically
doing power lifting,

406
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:49,960
which probably not a good idea.
Um,

407
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
so ron has a lot of problems with his 
discs in his back and I'm not sure of 

408
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,120
all the details,
but I know he's had a lot of fusions.

409
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:00,100
So his mobility and so on is going to be
limited.

410
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,220
And one fusion.
Yeah,

411
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,040
several.
So he can't turn his neck and his back 

412
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,230
to good.
And is that both of his hips replaced?

413
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,430
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

414
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,510
He's a young guy to hold.
Was Ronnie's?

415
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,800
No,
no run is like almost my age is probably

416
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,930
early fifties.
Yeah.

417
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,340
Why do I think he's younger than that?
He retired.

418
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,910
I'm thinking should I said 4,636?
He did.

419
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,560
We both were known to be very strong 
running more so than myself because they

420
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:29,340
did power lifting before.
So we moved some heavy weights and uh,

421
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,430
you know,
any sport man is that you're going to 

422
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:34,430
have some consequences.
Yeah.

423
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,530
No To ron if you fight and play 
football,

424
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,300
whatever and everything has its,
you know,

425
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,690
its downside.

426
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,310
But all things considering I think I'm 
doing pretty good.

427
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,980
I'm healthy and you know,
I got a dicky shoulder.

428
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:48,900
So big deal.
It's okay.

429
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,370
Yeah.
I'm telling you man,

430
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:55,371
if you just hang in there,
they're on their way to figuring 

431
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:55,371
something out for that.
Yeah,

432
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:55,371
that's,
that's almost what I'm thinking.

433
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:59,870
I'm thinking like don't do anything now 
because a few years time there'll be 

434
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:00,980
something that can really do the job.
So yeah,

435
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,450
I'll wait until then.
Yeah.

436
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,990
The last thing you want to do is get 
something.

437
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:08,991
Like,
I always tell that to my friends that 

438
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:08,991
are thinking about getting disks fused 
and like,

439
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:09,150
you know,
they're so close.

440
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,370
They're shooting.
They're shooting stem cells into the 

441
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,511
discs directly in regenerating tissue 
the same way they've been regenerating 

442
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:21,530
municipals,
tissue and tendon tissue and things 

443
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,291
along those lines.
I met a guy that trained out here many 

444
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,410
years ago in La and he told me they were
an I've seen before and after x rays of 

445
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:30,600
joints that are the joints destroyed.

446
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
He's got no cartilage,
so looking at replacement and these guys

447
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:35,490
have actually regenerated the tissue 
back,

448
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,670
but it's quite a lengthy process of 
traction,

449
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,730
like hanging upside down and hours of 
ultrasound just to push a ton of blood 

450
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,841
into that area.
Blood Supply and then you can heal it 

451
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,271
up.
You can actually regrow cartilage 

452
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:50,271
tissue,
but it's not.

453
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:50,790
Um,
it's not quick.

454
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,880
It's not on the protocol of the Medical 
Association.

455
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:56,730
So they basically push these guys out of
business with lawsuits.

456
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,330
Well,
you know,

457
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:02,331
there's a doctor that we've talked about
on the podcast before that recommends 

458
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:05,901
hanging from a bars for your shoulders.
It's one of the best things ever to 

459
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:10,080
alleviate pain and also to increase 
range of motion and reduce impingements.

460
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,420
Well,
I'll have to get in touch with this guy.

461
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,860
Yeah.
Well just for my,

462
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,180
for my back,
I got the inversion table and I do that 

463
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,290
a couple of times a week just to keep 
them ability there.

464
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,600
I know one of my discs,
l five five's a little bit warm,

465
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,690
but I don't do squats or heavy overhead 
stuff,

466
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,010
so I think it's going to be okay.
But yeah,

467
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:28,230
I still,
you know,

468
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,820
it's all about prevention.
Have you heard of the reverse hyper 

469
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:33,820
machine?
Have you seen that?

470
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:33,820
No.
No.

471
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,460
We have one in the back.
I'll show it to you,

472
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:38,910
but it's a creation of a west side 
barbell.

473
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,160
You know Louie Simmons,
crazy bastard.

474
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:46,161
Yeah.
Louie Simmons created this machine that 

475
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,020
when you lift your legs up,
it strengthens back and on the

476
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,540
down.
When it swings down,

477
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,560
it's active decompression,
phenomenal for disc issues.

478
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:56,320
It's like active decompression plus 
strengthening together.

479
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,360
I have one back here.
I love it so much.

480
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,940
Right there is like this.
You could see it up here.

481
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,380
It's.
We've talked about this so many times 

482
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,640
people would think this guy is like 
hired me to endorse this product,

483
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,920
but it's an amazing product.
That is.

484
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:13,921
Yeah.
It's the reverse of the hyperextension 

485
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:13,921
la,
so he can explain it.

486
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,150
Can hear the range of motion at the top.
Squeeze,

487
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,080
squeeze,
squeeze.

488
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,910
Really?
She drops her head.

489
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,710
Raise your hand.
Way Up.

490
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,870
Drops on the way down for a flagship in 
extension is fine.

491
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,100
This will absolutely help desk.
This is traction.

492
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,100
Motion Traction,
and got one of those

493
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,320
wife very fit,
so I'm sure she does a lot of lifting as

494
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:44,830
well.
So that was a world champion as well.

495
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:45,640
Enough failed.
You know,

496
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,760
it's so common for anybody that puts any
strain in their body to have usually 

497
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,000
five l and l,
four area on the.

498
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,050
On the bottom of the spine,
one of the things about bodybuilding is 

499
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,800
that in isolation,
when you're,

500
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,660
you're constantly isolating these 
things,

501
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,250
does that run the risk of like a 
weakening certain areas?

502
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:08,251
Like you have to be?
I would imagine very cognizant about 

503
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:08,251
balancing everything out.

504
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,820
Um,
I think,

505
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:12,040
uh,
like with bodybuilders,

506
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:17,041
a shoulder injuries is the most common 
because you've got the rotator cuff 

507
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,580
which is a small muscles and tendons 
which gives you the ability.

508
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,590
That's why it can move it around rather 
than being a hinge.

509
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,260
Um,
so what happens,

510
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,470
you know,
you get an strongly at altschool,

511
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,130
all these external muscles are getting 
bigger and stronger,

512
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,490
but these guys inside I'm not.
So eventually they get overloaded and 

513
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
you get some kind of issue there,
some kind of tear.

514
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,530
So when I'm training people now I give 
them a rotation exercises to strengthen 

515
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,590
those areas so that can avoid that.
But Hey man,

516
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,620
I started training.
The eight is like we didn't know 

517
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,640
anything and when I got an injury and 
are living in England as well,

518
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,680
there's no sports medicine doctors 
dealing with strength athletes or so on.

519
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,410
And so I just go to your doctor and he's
like,

520
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,730
how do you do that?
Lifting weights,

521
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,720
stopped doing that shit.
Why you left their wives,

522
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,610
take these pills and that's,
you know,

523
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,850
so,
so now we have much more information,

524
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,140
much more,
you know,

525
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,460
a sports therapist and so on.
So there's a lot more things available 

526
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,341
now and a lot more knowledge and 
information that we didn't really have 

527
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:17,341
back then.
You know,

528
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,610
that's,
that's the main thing,

529
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:23,611
you know,
collect some of the smallest supporting 

530
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,941
muscles.
I think when you're doing major 

531
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:26,941
bodybuilding exercises,

532
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:30,580
do guys now address that?
Do they do like a lot of rotation 

533
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,930
exercises?
A lot of rotation

534
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,740
in the gym than like,
you know,

535
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,940
if it did that back in the eighties,
people like what the fuck you're doing 

536
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,130
little wait time,
lift some weights.

537
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,130
But I see people doing it now and with 
the bands and everything.

538
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:45,220
So yeah,
people doing more preventative stuff.

539
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,190
It's fascinating

540
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,190
because there was guys like arnold who 
was kind of the original pioneers and 

541
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,720
then guys like you who came after him,
but you were still again,

542
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,540
pre-internet,
figuring things out on your own,

543
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,340
learning from the guys that came before 
you,

544
00:23:58,341 --> 00:23:59,870
but taking it to another level,

545
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,990
that was the beauty of it for me.
I never really liked team sports because

546
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:06,390
I just felt like this I sold was letting
me down here,

547
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:11,391
you know,
and I felt like that through my life as 

548
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:11,391
well.
I felt like,

549
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:12,600
like my parents didn't really,
you know,

550
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,430
like everyone's fucking letting me down.
Fuck this,

551
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:19,431
I'll do this myself.
And so I got to learn about the 

552
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:19,431
nutrition.
I learned about the training,

553
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,440
I got to do it,
I've got to pull it all into action and 

554
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,321
of course I had people supporting me,
but when I got on that stage it was win 

555
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:32,451
or lose.
I'm taking full responsibility for this 

556
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:36,260
and we don't really have that now.
And the guys don't learn anything 

557
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,020
because they've got coaches.
So what should I do?

558
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,750
Bus Do this,
do that and eat this and eat that.

559
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:41,850
Okay,
and you know,

560
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,640
the beauty of it's gone,
you're not learning anything anymore.

561
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,360
What if you fall out with the coach like
I was going to do next contest.

562
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,290
So is that like a big thing now?
Like there's like a series of coaches,

563
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,410
is it like MMA camps?
It's the same thing and it's like,

564
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,370
I dunno,
I think the guys a suckers because who 

565
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,040
is making the money here?
The coaches,

566
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,380
the coaches are making the money,
not the,

567
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:09,410
not the competitors.
The coaches are smart and I look at the 

568
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,781
coaches and I say,
who the fuck are you and what have you 

569
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:11,781
done?
You know,

570
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:12,720
what,
which contest if you actually want.

571
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,410
And most of them haven't done anything.
It's just all theory.

572
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,060
So I'm sort of the exercise 
physiologists,

573
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,120
just guys from the industry that,
you know,

574
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,860
they're,
they've trained a few people and they've

575
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,390
got a few results and uh,
it's more about the,

576
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,080
for me it's more about the insecurity of
the guys competing.

577
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,260
Like why don't you learn yourself and 
listen to your body.

578
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,510
And I used to make notes,
you know,

579
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:43,080
every week I'd write down my diet,
I'd write down every single workout that

580
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:47,550
I ever did from 1984 to 1997.
I have in a training log.

581
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,910
You should sell that.
I printed out all these little exercise 

582
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:53,880
books,
you know,

583
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:57,090
and like you can see the first one went 
on like 21 years old.

584
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:59,400
It's a bit childish with the comments,
what it's like,

585
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,450
you know,
I felt shit today.

586
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:03,240
This was a shitty worker.
Never fucking let this happen again,

587
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,320
you know,
all this stuff.

588
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:09,321
I'm talking to myself.
So I've got all this and then go back 

589
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:12,201
and look at it sometimes.
And it's weird because I can go back to 

590
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:16,380
1988 and I can look in my book and I 
look at that workout and I was like,

591
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,390
I was in this gym and I was training 
with this guy and I can't even remember.

592
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,760
Like I was like,
why do I was wearing.

593
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:26,970
And I can go back in time and remember 
just from those nodes.

594
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,410
Yeah,
like every workout.

595
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:30,060
As soon as I've got home and I finished,
I was like,

596
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:30,750
Hey,
bench press,

597
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:35,751
I did this,
and every month I would make notes and 

598
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:35,751
say,
okay,

599
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:39,830
this is what I'm doing now.
These are my goals for the next four 

600
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,830
weeks,
you know,

601
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,410
whatever,
like little goals,

602
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:42,540
like I'm going to put five pounds on my 
bench press,

603
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,880
but you do that every month.
Then the end of the month,

604
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:46,920
you've got your end of the year.
He got 60 pounds,

605
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:47,400
right?
So,

606
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,070
uh,
did all these things like,

607
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,640
you know,
a mental rehearsal,

608
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,160
visualization,
all this stuff.

609
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:56,930
I did it,
I just,

610
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,470
I kind of learned it.
Nobody,

611
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,700
nobody taught me.
So,

612
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,230
um,
that was one of the things,

613
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:06,231
goal setting,
writing and writing it down on a piece 

614
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:06,231
of paper just.

615
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:07,230
And that you can do this with anything,
your business,

616
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:12,231
whatever.
You're writing it down on a piece of 

617
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:12,231
paper,
you make a commitment,

618
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:12,231
it's fucking,
they're on a piece of paper everyday.

619
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:16,080
You can look at that and it just gives 
you a stronger mental vision.

620
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,910
And instead of saying,
right,

621
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,030
I'm going to win this contest in 18 
months time.

622
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Yeah,
that's cool you're going to win that 

623
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,180
contest,
but how are you going to get the.

624
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,180
It's like saying I'm going to sail to 
Australia.

625
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:27,990
Yeah,
it's a good idea.

626
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,310
That's cool,
but how are you going to get there?

627
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:31,020
If you've got a plan,
have you've got a map of like,

628
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,400
fuck,
you're going to go with no map,

629
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,570
you're just going to get lost,
you know?

630
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,440
So I found that very helpful and that's 
what I try to teach people as well,

631
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,060
you know?
Yeah.

632
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,070
I think writing down goals is huge and 
it's something that most people don't 

633
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,070
do.
Yeah,

634
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,680
I still do it now.
Like a daily thing.

635
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:46,440
This is what I got to do today.
Sometimes I won't get through it all,

636
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:47,850
but you know,
at least it's there.

637
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,530
I might put a couple of things off for 
tomorrow,

638
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:51,660
but I find it very,
very helpful.

639
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

640
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:54,690
And which I've written it down like,
you know,

641
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,640
like let's say a,
I don't know,

642
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,520
you want to stop drinking or something,
write it down.

643
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,670
I'm going to stop drinking alcohol,
sign it if I can put it there on your 

644
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,380
table.
It don't just have said that you've said

645
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,160
that you've made the commitment to put 
on a paper,

646
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,310
so you're gonna,
you're gonna let yourself down.

647
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,080
You're going to be a pussy,
you're going to be weak and you're going

648
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:13,590
to break that.

649
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,940
You made that commitment,
man,

650
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,740
you know,
it's there on a piece of paper.

651
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:17,560
So,
uh,

652
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,890
that's that strong.
Especially for the type of person like 

653
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,671
you dedicated focused guy.
Like something like that is just extra 

654
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:25,671
motivation in,
in a,

655
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:26,300
like a,
you know,

656
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,500
it's a scaffolding.
Yeah,

657
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,550
exactly.
Is there,

658
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,300
it's solid,
you know,

659
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,220
something.
Just say it casually.

660
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:34,410
I fucking committed to this.
I wrote it down,

661
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:35,070
you know?
Yeah.

662
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:36,560
I'm a firm believer.
I think you should,

663
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,200
at least for a week,
you know,

664
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,220
at least for your week,
set it down and have a little checkbox 

665
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,860
next to it and make sure you can look at
that.

666
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:44,640
Like,
I did this,

667
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,230
I got my workout in,
I got my,

668
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,310
my,
whatever.

669
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,250
Whatever you need to get done,
whatever you trying to slack off.

670
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,050
It's five things to do that I did for 
them.

671
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:56,640
I didn't do the fifth one because I 
smoked a joint with four to five.

672
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,190
Still that four out of five.
I would reward myself.

673
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,380
If you do write things down,
no,

674
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:06,381
you'll just get more done.
Even if you don't fulfill the entire 

675
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:08,850
even to get more done than than if you 
didn't do it 100 percent.

676
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:10,680
It's having a plan man and everything 
needs a plan.

677
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,570
If you want to get somewhere,
I'll use that analogy.

678
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:15,240
If you want to get somewhere,
if you're a captain on a ship,

679
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,890
you don't just get on the ship and say,
Hey Ho,

680
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:18,540
let's go silent and we're going to get 
there.

681
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,680
No,
you're probably not.

682
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
You need to.
You know,

683
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:25,440
you need a route to get there and you 
need to know what it takes to get there.

684
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,470
I'm going to do this.
I'm going to do this fight competition.

685
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,910
Yeah.
Cool.

686
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,280
But do you know what it takes to get 
there?

687
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,170
Right.
First of all,

688
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,640
this is what it takes.
Okay.

689
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,500
Are you prepared to do this?
Are you going to do this?

690
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,780
Yes or no,
and if it's yes,

691
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,890
go for it.
You.

692
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,980
If it's too much to

693
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,570
be honest,
I just don't fucking do it.

694
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:43,810
You know,

695
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,960
there was a time when you were a,
at the top of the heap where there was,

696
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:53,790
there was debate as to like what a 
bodybuilder should look like.

697
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:58,791
There was like the Frank Zane look,
which was like a strong obviously fit 

698
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:03,300
guy,
but much smaller and just symmetrical.

699
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,210
And then there was you that just came 
out like the fucking Hulk,

700
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,210
you then,
and then it was almost like overwhelming

701
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,700
for a lot of people.
And then there was this debate to try to

702
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:12,690
figure out.
Absolutely.

703
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Because when I look at a bunch of 
bodybuilders on a stage and they're 

704
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,960
trying to pick out who's number one,
who's number two,

705
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:20,610
I'm like,
I can't.

706
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,010
I mean,
I always assumed that it's like a lot of

707
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:25,140
other things,
like the deeper you are into it,

708
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:27,630
the more you can see the intricacies of 
it.

709
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,820
Whereas for me,
a person is not a bodybuilder.

710
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,440
I'm like,
they're all fucking huge.

711
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:33,840
Like how can you tell who's the best?

712
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh,
so it's a matter of um,

713
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,370
you know,
it's bodybuilding,

714
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,190
right?
Yeah.

715
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,710
So it's,
it's muscle size is a big factor.

716
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,510
It's not the only factor,
but it was a big factor.

717
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:45,630
If you look at the Mr Olympia is,
for instance,

718
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,230
in the era of Frank Zane and Frank Zane 
is a body that probably most people 

719
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,290
would look at and say,
fuck it.

720
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:53,780
Now that's,
that's it.

721
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,110
That's great.
And you know,

722
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,420
probably look at me and say it's too 
extreme.

723
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,100
Um,
but in the era of Frank Zane,

724
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,940
who was Mr Olympia was Arnold Arnold was
Mr Olympia.

725
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:08,130
You could,
you could argue that Frank Zane,

726
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:11,970
his buddy his is more aesthetic and 
nicer and prettier than Arnold,

727
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,060
but Arnold beach and why it just was 
bigger,

728
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,220
more freakishly impressed,
his bigger.

729
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,460
And uh,
Lee Haney was eight times Mr Olympia,

730
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,060
you could argue maybe Lila abroad or,
or somebody like that was better 

731
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,020
proportion and put together,
but he was much smaller.

732
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,380
So,
you know,

733
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,740
Frank Guy,
you would see the gym today like a 

734
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,551
regular dude.
There's a lot of regular duties under 

735
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:37,920
the,
a category now.

736
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,470
So you've got bodybuilding.
Um,

737
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,810
but you've got other categories now that
you didn't have.

738
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,020
So you've got men's physique,
which is more of this a type of 

739
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,281
physique,
they're looking for various theoretic 

740
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:52,281
tight waist,
everything like that.

741
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,130
And you've even got classic 
bodybuilding,

742
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,780
which is height over weight ratio.
So you know,

743
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,940
the guys are not that big.
So you've got different categories as a 

744
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,660
reaction to people not really liking the
direction that bodybuilding went and,

745
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,160
and uh,
yeah,

746
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:09,630
I'll take responsibility for it going 
the size root and um,

747
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,020
I had a nice physique when I started,
you know,

748
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,130
I had a nice physique,
had nice abs and everything,

749
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,050
but I'm like,
if I'm going to do this,

750
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:18,450
I'm going to do this to the Max and I'm 
going to see how far,

751
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,770
you know,
how big can I get,

752
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,720
how can I get,
how strong can I get?

753
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,780
I want to go to the Max and I don't want
people to say,

754
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,350
oh,
that's,

755
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,000
wow,
that's a nice physique.

756
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,240
I want people to say what the

757
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,460
fuck?
That's what I want it to do.

758
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,260
Well,
you succeeded in that.

759
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,050
You definitely succeeded.
Yeah.

760
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,330
The guy that inspired me to before that,
that

761
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:42,330
was Tom Platz.
I don't know if you're not with the 

762
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:42,330
fucking

763
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,280
freaky legs and you know,
he was the guy,

764
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,410
um,
when I started,

765
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,100
it wasn't Mr Olympia,
but he was very inspirational and um,

766
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,600
when he talked it was just full of 
energy and enthusiasm for the training 

767
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,760
and pushing the body to its absolute 
maximum.

768
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,460
And I remember Tom Platz saying,
you know,

769
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,460
when I walk out on stage in a 
bodybuilding competition,

770
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,820
I want to see those judges there with a 
pencil and the paper.

771
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,850
And I was just wanting to fucking drop 
that pencil and just say what the fuck 

772
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,990
is that?
We're so big.

773
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,040
His legs were so freakishly big like 
that guy had,

774
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:24,050
like,
nobody has really surpassed Tom Platz 

775
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,430
his leg.
I don't think to this day.

776
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,420
It's fair to say

777
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,660
now is that just,
it's weird because it's very rare that 

778
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,520
someone's known very specifically for a 
body part that we plats is known for his

779
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,380
legs.
What plats made a whole career on,

780
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,640
on the legs.
And uh,

781
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,400
not only the legs,

782
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,320
the passion he had for like pushing 
himself into the gym for the,

783
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,380
to the absolute maximum.
And that inspired me to do that and try 

784
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,440
and take it even further and that now is
missing.

785
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:54,260
That's not here anymore.
Now for me,

786
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,390
the bodybuilding and the fitness 
industry,

787
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,440
people are just really more concerned 
with the cosmetic,

788
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,830
the look and you know,
taking their pictures and putting them 

789
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,020
instagram and all this kind of stuff.
They're not really into as almost a 

790
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:10,990
spiritual side of it.
You know,

791
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
where you want to push yourself to that 
maximum and see how far you can go and 

792
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,330
how,
you know,

793
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,910
how far your mind can go into the pain 
and all that kind of stuff.

794
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,480
That's not really there anymore.
Well,

795
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:22,550
what's,
what's missing?

796
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,110
Like,
what's the element that's missing?

797
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,490
Like why isn't that near?
Um,

798
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,880
I dunno man.
I mean a collection of society in 

799
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,170
general.
People just want stuff like,

800
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,180
you know,
they want stuff easy.

801
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:35,930
Now.
You know,

802
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,000
everyone wants to be famous,
but the picture on Instagram,

803
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:40,100
you don't need to do shit.
Just be famous.

804
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,880
Go on.
Big Brother.

805
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:42,780
Be famous for nothing.
Nothing.

806
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,670
Yeah.
That's,

807
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,300
I don't know.
I think that's a reflection of the way 

808
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,300
things are perhaps in everything.

809
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,660
But what's the difference in the way the
bodybuilders approach it today?

810
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:56,661
I mean,
they're obviously doing something 

811
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:56,661
because there's still huge on.
They're still,

812
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,550
you know,
these giant guys that are lifting 

813
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,720
weights.
So what element,

814
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:02,100
if you look at the giant guys that have

815
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,350
whites now that don't look quite like 
myself and the guys from the nineties 

816
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,210
now the guys are just big everywhere.
The waste.

817
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:11,650
So huge.
Everything huge.

818
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Um,
and it's 20 years since I competed in a 

819
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,071
contest,
so I don't exactly know what the guys 

820
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:23,641
are using a lot more different to drugs 
and we use a lot more insulin and igf,

821
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:25,300
things like that.
So,

822
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,620
um,
I think what you're seeing in the big 

823
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,121
guys is somewhat systemic growth.
It's like they just got bit bigger 

824
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,820
everywhere and that doesn't look,
uh,

825
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,730
so appealing I think,
right,

826
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:38,410
when their guts extent.
Yeah.

827
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:42,240
So maybe the relying more on the 
chemicals and they don't really,

828
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,300
you know,
I haven't really heard anything from any

829
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:48,210
of the bodybuilding champions in the 
last 10 or 15 years.

830
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:53,211
I don't think I'm interesting or new or 
revolutionary in the training methods.

831
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,650
It just,
you know,

832
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,260
I don't really even talk about it that 
much now.

833
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,730
Everyone just does the same stuff.
Know.

834
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,650
Well,
it was at one point in time where no one

835
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:02,880
talked about it at all.
Right.

836
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:07,881
Like it was.
You would get the magazines and they 

837
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:07,881
would tell you to take creatine and you 
could look like me,

838
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:10,410
but everybody kind of knew who.
Everybody who knew.

839
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:13,870
People who knew people was somewhat 
Vienna circle.

840
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,070
Yeah.
I remember I started in the eighties and

841
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:22,071
I read the magazines and a few things by
Arnold and Mike Mansa where they kind of

842
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:25,500
admitted that use something,
but they've downplayed it.

843
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,580
Oh,
it's only for the last six weeks before 

844
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,841
a competition just to give us that last 
Polish and stuff like that and ask a few

845
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,280
guys in the gym.
And when I first started they were a bit

846
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,030
cagey,
like,

847
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,650
no,
no,

848
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:37,160
no,
no,

849
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,340
don't,
I don't do that.

850
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,670
And later on I found out they're all,
they're all doing it,

851
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:41,910
right?

852
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,170
Yeah.
Um,

853
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,680
and it was very much an inner circle in 
the gym.

854
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,730
Bodybuilders now everybody knows about 
steroids and now it's mainstream.

855
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,120
And guys take steroids now just for 
cosmetic reasons because they want to 

856
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,830
look bigger and harder and quicker.
Uh,

857
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,620
I just equate it to women having a 
botox.

858
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:04,110
So having some implants,
the guys want to look bigger.

859
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,210
I don't want to work so hard.
They don't want to,

860
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,410
you know,
they just want to quick,

861
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:12,411
right?
So you get guys coming to the gym and 

862
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:12,411
that just takes steroids pretty much 
straight away.

863
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:17,360
Um,
I don't necessarily learn how to train 

864
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,210
really properly.
Um,

865
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,750
and uh,
it's not just competitive bodybuilders 

866
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:23,750
now.
I mean,

867
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,390
it's everywhere.
It's everywhere.

868
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:25,950
It's mainstream.
You look at Hollywood,

869
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:27,660
you look at hip hop artists.
I mean,

870
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:28,440
come on,
they're all,

871
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,220
they're all doing a bit of juice,
man.

872
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:35,250
Look,
look at nearly 10 years ago and look at 

873
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:35,250
him now,
man.

874
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:35,260
He was just,
I haven't really been interested in La.

875
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,320
There's a,
there's a lot of them.

876
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,600
Nearly a cool J.
I mean,

877
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:40,690
you know,
they all,

878
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,950
they're all jack man.
I'm know it's not fully me.

879
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:46,680
I can see what's going on guys from 
Hollywood,

880
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,570
they want to get in shape quickly for a 
movie.

881
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:54,230
You know,
guys just want to look good on the 

882
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,230
beach.
Um,

883
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,230
it's,
it's,

884
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,020
it's everywhere now.
It's main course.

885
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,190
There's nearly damp.
No,

886
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,150
he's checked.
Yeah.

887
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,770
We saw a picture of a huge Jackman when 
he was preparing for Wolverine was doing

888
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:06,771
dead lifts and uh,
he was in his forties and someone was 

889
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:06,771
asking me,
do you think he's,

890
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:07,650
I guess,
yeah.

891
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,310
Well,
I mean,

892
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,180
how much did it get paid for the movie 
as well?

893
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,670
Fuck yeah.
Well No,

894
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,710
not only that,
like tip for a guy that is not really 

895
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,320
that kind of an athlete to all of a 
sudden look like that.

896
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Like you got to make some radical 
physiological changes and a couple of 

897
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,900
months like that was,
that's not even a good picture of man.

898
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,840
It's real good pictures of them checked.
But um,

899
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,740
I mean there's pictures of him from the 
movie too,

900
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,600
which just,
he's enormous.

901
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Like he just became an enormous guy.
What I'm saying is like how much did he 

902
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,250
get paid for the movie?
And my point is,

903
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,650
you know,
he got paid for that.

904
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,580
So maybe he took her little health risk 
or whatever.

905
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:45,520
You can debate that,
but he's getting paid for it,

906
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,920
but is it worth it if you're just doing 
it?

907
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:52,921
Just fucking look good on the beach and 
all look good for the girls or 

908
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:52,921
something.
Yeah,

909
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,260
I'm trying to put it in.
But here's the.

910
00:38:55,261 --> 00:38:56,080
Here's the thing,
man.

911
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,620
Once you get on that merry go round,
you don't want to get off.

912
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,730
That's the problem.
Right?

913
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:03,790
And you don't want to get off because 
you took some stuff.

914
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,130
You know,
you got bigger,

915
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:07,600
you getting more attention from the 
girls.

916
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:11,260
Now guys got more respect for you.
Your self confidence is up.

917
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,230
You don't,
you don't lose all that man.

918
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,540
Well,
speaking personally because what I took 

919
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:19,540
it for a competitive sport.
I'm going to stop that.

920
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,080
Stop.
That was it.

921
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:21,370
But that was my,
that's my question.

922
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:26,371
Like how did you just accept the fact 
that you were no longer a superhuman 

923
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:29,350
looking freak show of a man?
Now you became a regular man.

924
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,190
Was there a lot?
My whole thing was see if with 

925
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,300
bodybuilding competition,
uh,

926
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,860
I never showed my physique even in the 
gym with the guys that are trained with.

927
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,890
I was covered up all the time if I want 
to look at my physique and practice my 

928
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:46,890
poses and stuff,
I did it at home.

929
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,970
So on the street I always wore long 
sleeve.

930
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,100
I don't give a shit about anybody else.
Why is that?

931
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,370
Because I did it purely for competition.
But why did you cover it?

932
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:59,371
Why don't you just dress like with a.
because it's freaking wanted attention 

933
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:00,310
all the fucking time and I'm not 
interested in it,

934
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:05,311
you know,
I'm a quiet guy and I just wanted to go 

935
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:07,680
about my business and reveal this thing.
I've been working on [inaudible].

936
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,570
I didn't see it as being.
It's almost removed.

937
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:15,571
It's like a statue I'm working on so I 
wasn't tied up in like I was tied up in 

938
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,670
being Mr Olympia because that's who I 
was and that,

939
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,460
you know,
somewhat a,

940
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,460
a plane.
Um,

941
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,360
what the whole huge body and I didn't,
I didn't need that for,

942
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,890
for everyday use.
Well,

943
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,891
that sort of fits with this whole 
Spartan image that people had a view 

944
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:36,310
that you are the image of you was like 
this guy that was just doing work that 

945
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,500
other people weren't willing to do and 
some sort of quiet isolation somewhere.

946
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,830
So literally we're not as deep basement 
a basement in Birmingham,

947
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,530
England where,
you know,

948
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,720
it's not exactly a hotbed of 
bodybuilding activity,

949
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,440
no beaches or nothing.
It's an industrial city.

950
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,870
Um,
so I just locked myself away there and 

951
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:55,870
worked on this project and I love doing 
it.

952
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,430
I love just being in that tunnel,
you know,

953
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,780
seeing what I can do and obviously the 
further you get along,

954
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,150
the more difficult it is to make any 
kind of improvements.

955
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,780
But I was trying,
you know,

956
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,220
that's fascinating to look at it that 
way is almost like an art project.

957
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,150
There was a statue I was removed.
It was not my,

958
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,490
I wasn't like building this body so I 
could get,

959
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,730
you know,
admiring from the girls or the guys 

960
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,070
going to be.
I was already like a fit strong guy 

961
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,371
before I started.
So I didn't come from that place of 

962
00:41:26,371 --> 00:41:28,681
like,
I need to do this to make myself feel 

963
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:30,661
better,
I need to do this because I have some 

964
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:31,480
talent for it and I can change my life 
with this.

965
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:34,040
Maybe I didn't know it was going to be 
Mr Olympia,

966
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,560
but I just knew that if I put my energy 
into this,

967
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,360
something positive was going to come 
from it.

968
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,300
And after a few years I won the British 
Championship.

969
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,510
And because of that,
you know,

970
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,470
I was British champion.
I didn't have a car.

971
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,100
I went home to a one bedroom apartment 
with no furniture.

972
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,830
I didn't even have a proper bed.
I had a mattress on the floor,

973
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,590
I didn't have shit,
but I wasn't the British championship.

974
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,130
And because of that somebody put up the 
money for me to open a gym.

975
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Then I had a gym,
then it was making an income from my 

976
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,360
sport.
So even if it went that far,

977
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,730
it would have been worth it,
you know?

978
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,490
Wow.

979
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,580
Well,
I think that attitude is probably what's

980
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:11,090
made you like very healthy mentally 
afterwards,

981
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,210
what are separate from your body and 
that it was a project,

982
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,450
there was a paragraph

983
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,480
the way it was very tough because I was 
a sky or was Mr Olympia and this is 

984
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,160
solely been doing since I was 21 years 
old.

985
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:28,370
And then I got an injury.
So my exit from the sport was not 

986
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:32,451
calculated.
I told my tricep tendon on the left 

987
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:35,730
elbow and this had already won injury,
a bicep tear.

988
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:39,150
But I kind of handled that and it didn't
affect my training too much,

989
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,920
but this was almost a complete 
detachment that I have to repair.

990
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,480
And after that I just knew I couldn't,
I couldn't lift properly and like,

991
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,520
you know,
you can't compete with the rest of the 

992
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,520
world if you can't lift properly.
Um,

993
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,880
so I had to retire and then I was lucky 
in limbo as know who the fuck am I and 

994
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,860
what am,
what am I going to do with my life?

995
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,930
So it took me a few years to kind of 
slowly get back,

996
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,460
but it wasn't about,
Oh,

997
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:04,140
I've lost my muscles when I'm going to 
do.

998
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,080
Like it was more about,
you know,

999
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,910
I don't know what my role is in life.
I don't know who I am.

1000
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:13,970
It took me a long time to find that.
And I think a lot of athletes that 

1001
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,990
retired from sport,
they have the same same issues.

1002
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,730
It's a giant issue with fighters.
You,

1003
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:22,740
you know,
you've got this fucking tunnel that 

1004
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:22,740
you're in,
right?

1005
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,290
It's almost like being at war like 
stressful,

1006
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,930
but you know,
you've got this role and this,

1007
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:27,640
this thing that you just aim and for all
of them

1008
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,080
time and now it's gone.
Like what the fuck you going to do?

1009
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,970
Who are you,
what it's all about,

1010
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:37,971
you know?
So it took me years to kind of come to 

1011
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:40,770
peace with that.
But it wasn't about losing the muscles.

1012
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,730
It was about losing my goal and my focus
in my role in life.

1013
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:45,120
I think.

1014
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:45,770
Yeah,
the,

1015
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:50,810
for a lot of athletes it's the intensity
of life is all of a sudden reduce down 

1016
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:55,611
to a mundane normal guy and lows and 
mediums the time.

1017
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,630
Um,
but I turned it around because when I 

1018
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,550
was doing bodybuilding,
my life was very restrictive,

1019
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:04,710
like a fucking monk,
you know,

1020
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,960
I just had this regime and I didn't want
to socialize.

1021
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:09,520
I didn't want to do anything outside of 
that.

1022
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,940
So after some time I came like,
hey man,

1023
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,780
so you can't do that anymore.
What about,

1024
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:20,781
how about the thousand and one things 
you didn't do when you were doing that 

1025
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,360
because you couldn't.
Now you couldn't do all those things.

1026
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:26,770
You can go a do you know,
not eat all day if you don't want to eat

1027
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,390
six meals a day,
you can do what you want,

1028
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:33,391
you know.
So I started looking into some other 

1029
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:35,851
things was interested in,
I was always been interested in 

1030
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,331
wildlife.
So I started going a few safaris and 

1031
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:38,940
things like that and yeah,
slowly I realized like,

1032
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,850
Hey,
there's a million and one things you can

1033
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:43,980
do in life like this,
you know,

1034
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,240
get over this.

1035
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,730
So it's just a transitionary 
transitional period.

1036
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:48,240
Yeah.
But,

1037
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,260
um,
I can absolutely see why many athletes 

1038
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,260
struggle.
Uh,

1039
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,060
Frank Bruno,
who was,

1040
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,500
you know,
a boxer,

1041
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,530
well boxing champion from Uk.
I know he had a really hard time and 

1042
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,700
almost like he was world champion when I
was Mr Olympian.

1043
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,180
We've tried at the same time.
We both got divorced like everything 

1044
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:07,180
falls apart,
man,

1045
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:07,180
like,
you know.

1046
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Um,
and then you hopefully rebuild back to 

1047
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,480
something else.
Yeah.

1048
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:17,481
It seems that very few athletes have a 
smooth process into retirement and 

1049
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
fighters in particular,
they always come back when they 

1050
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,000
shouldn't.
Yeah.

1051
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,820
Well I know why they do that.
When I was a kid,

1052
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,190
I was always,
why is Ali coming back,

1053
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:27,010
man?
Like just,

1054
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:32,410
you know,
he's the greatest and now he's going to 

1055
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:32,410
get beat by some guy cause it's coming 
back.

1056
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,230
What do you miss the fucking adrenaline 
or whatever it is,

1057
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,300
if that,
you know,

1058
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,520
that all your focus,
all your soul,

1059
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:40,530
everything is going into that one point.

1060
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,320
And like it's,
it's tough to replace,

1061
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,300
but you've got to know when it's time to
step down.

1062
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:48,810
I think now when you did decide,
did you have a plan,

1063
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:53,811
did you write out a plan,
like how to step down because he wrote 

1064
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:53,811
out a plan for the rest of your life?
No,

1065
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:55,220
because it was,
it was like new.

1066
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,310
Tara was like that,
you know,

1067
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:59,850
it was like I didn't have a plan for the
injury.

1068
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,960
Yeah,
vaguely.

1069
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,380
I had an idea in my mind that I would 
like to open more germs when I finished 

1070
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,950
bodybuilding.
I'm actually,

1071
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:09,450
I didn't happen,
but um,

1072
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:15,050
I started my own nutrition company which
is still doing sports nutrition during 

1073
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:15,390
unites a sports nutrition.
So,

1074
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:21,060
um,
put a lot of energy into that and a 

1075
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,630
different things and being able to 
experience things in life that I shut 

1076
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:24,030
myself off with.

1077
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:28,200
So that's how I dealt with it and now I 
feel I felt great about it and I kind of

1078
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:31,740
look back and I can sit back and say,
you know what,

1079
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,060
I couldn't give any more to that thing.
I couldn't have given any more.

1080
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:38,370
So there's no regrets.
Like a lot of athletes,

1081
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,890
you know when you're young and you're 
there,

1082
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:45,891
maybe you don't really appreciate it so 
much and then when it's gone you're 

1083
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:45,891
like,
shit man,

1084
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:46,170
what if I'd done this?
What if,

1085
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:46,770
what if,
what if,

1086
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:47,890
what if,
you know,

1087
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,110
I don't have those.
What ifs?

1088
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:54,111
Man,
I did 100 percent even too much to the 

1089
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:54,660
point where I got injured,
so I'm,

1090
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,790
you know,
I'm happy with that.

1091
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,870
I can put that to rest.
That's a great lesson.

1092
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:00,630
That's a great lesson for young people 
coming up.

1093
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,200
If you just do all the work when it's 
over,

1094
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,240
it's so what you can do it man,
win or lose,

1095
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:09,030
you do what you can do and then you have
the self satisfaction,

1096
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:10,590
the pride to look back and say,
you know what,

1097
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,860
I fucking give it everything I had and 
no regrets.

1098
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:19,250
And that's the way I feel about it.
And I know there's a lot of my 

1099
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,370
contemporaries that compete against me.
I don't really feel like that.

1100
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,730
That's why a few of them are still there
in the fifties and the making comebacks.

1101
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's one of the most horrible things 
to see someone who's lived a life of 

1102
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,070
regret.
Yeah.

1103
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:29,980
This has

1104
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,990
just narrative and I don't like to see 
athletes coming back when they're not as

1105
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:38,230
you remember them at their best and 
they're coming back and the not so good,

1106
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:43,231
which I'm sorry,
but inevitably at 50 years old is going 

1107
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:46,951
to be the case.
Is there any body builders are doing 

1108
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:46,951
that now at 50?
Uh,

1109
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:47,940
yeah.
Kevin Love Ron who came second to me and

1110
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,890
Mr Olympia.
He made a comeback last year.

1111
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,710
Really?
Yeah.

1112
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,480
How do you look?
Uh,

1113
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,050
well,
it depends how I answered that question.

1114
00:47:56,051 --> 00:48:01,051
How did,
how did it look compared to previously 

1115
00:48:01,051 --> 00:48:04,320
not good at all?
How to look for a guy that's making a 

1116
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:04,320
comeback at 50 years old?
Yeah.

1117
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,880
Great.
But it's not a 50 year old guy looking 

1118
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,160
good contest.
This Mr Olympia as well.

1119
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,010
So,
um,

1120
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,430
you know,
just tried to make it come back within a

1121
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,540
year.
It doesn't take many,

1122
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,370
many years to get to that kind of shape.

1123
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,180
So I was the thing with bodybuilding,
you,

1124
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:28,310
you've got a thing called muscle memory,
so maybe it took me 10 years to get to 

1125
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:33,910
be 260 pounds ripped,
but now that information is in my DNA.

1126
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:39,270
It's there so I could theoretically not 
trained for 10 years.

1127
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,050
Lewis,
all that muscle,

1128
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,840
I'm probably get that back in six to 12 
months.

1129
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,590
Really?
Yeah,

1130
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,800
absolutely.
Well I've heard of muscle memory and I 

1131
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,820
know that it's a thing but it hasn't 
been physically isolated.

1132
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:54,220
What causes that or how it is in your 
DNA?

1133
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:00,060
I'm not really sure if they have or if 
they're interested enough to do to the 

1134
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,080
studies that's necessary,
but those of us that are in the sport,

1135
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:06,760
we know it happens.
I mean arnold did it like a 1974.

1136
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,880
I think Arnold was gonna retire,
but then it got this pumping iron movie 

1137
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,180
that everyone's familiar with.

1138
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,270
Um,
so the 1975 Mr Olympia,

1139
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:21,271
which the pumping iron and runs around,
he basically made a comeback for that 

1140
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:24,940
just just for the movie.
And previous to that he did a movie 

1141
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,191
called stay hungry with Sally Field and 
Jeff Bridges and I think he had to get 

1142
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:29,500
down to like 200,
200,

1143
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:32,800
10 pounds because the director didn't 
want them to be too big for that.

1144
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,160
So he came off the back of that and they
just put all the sides back on for the 

1145
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,320
Mr Olympia for pumping it.
Really?

1146
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:43,321
There's.
So the director made him sort of a 

1147
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:43,321
macy's himself.
Well,

1148
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:44,110
he still looked pretty big,
I guess for the average person.

1149
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,250
Yeah.
Oh Man.

1150
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:49,300
That's nothing compared to how he looks.
But next to Jeff Bridges.

1151
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,540
Yeah.
I mean he looks like a really big fit 

1152
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:54,660
guy that you'd see at the gym.
Look at Jeff Bridges.

1153
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,390
The dude abides.
I liked to do.

1154
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,940
I love that guy.
He's still around,

1155
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:05,941
man.
Still banging out great movies and 

1156
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:05,941
talking about how many great movies that
guy's been in.

1157
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:10,620
Absolutely.
What's the one where he's a country 

1158
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:10,620
singer.
That was great.

1159
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:10,780
Oh,
like,

1160
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:11,290
yeah.
Yeah.

1161
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,700
That was recent.
Yeah.

1162
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,410
God Damn it.
I saw that.

1163
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,250
That was a good movie.

1164
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:18,070
Yeah,
he,

1165
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,170
he's,
he's good at choosing roles.

1166
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,440
So when,
when a guy does get down to something 

1167
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,621
like that,
is it a matter of taking less steroids 

1168
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:31,381
working out last,
like your body just naturally starts to 

1169
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:31,381
shrink

1170
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:31,381
pure.
Uh,

1171
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:35,860
if you're taking steroids and you're 
stopped and you're going to lose a lot 

1172
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,520
of weight pretty quick and maybe just 
don't lift weights,

1173
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,130
play tennis,
do swim into something else,

1174
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:41,990
and your muscle mass,
it's going to go down.

1175
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:43,250
So I'm guessing that's what it is.

1176
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,520
Now.
When you first started bodybuilding,

1177
00:50:45,521 --> 00:50:48,220
how long did it take before you did take
something?

1178
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:54,130
After about 18 months I decided I want 
to do a contest and I knew the guys in 

1179
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:54,560
the contest.
We're taking stuff.

1180
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:57,050
So I just want to be on a level playing 
field with them.

1181
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,620
Um,
so like two months before my first 

1182
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,880
contest in which take a little ballot,
Debo,

1183
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,650
20 milligrams a day,
a day.

1184
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:11,600
That was the first thing I ever had.
And then narrowed to the contest,

1185
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:16,601
I switched to some Var and Prima Bolin,
but I mean 20 milligrams a day is like 

1186
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,860
fitness chicks take that.

1187
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,730
No.
Do they do,

1188
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,070
do take steroids,
right?

1189
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,830
Means paying hundred percent,
100 percent,

1190
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,200
even bikini chicks like skinny,
but because they want to look harder,

1191
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:34,480
they went a leaner and it's uh,
you know,

1192
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:39,350
I got girls that are fucking strippers 
and all kinds of chicks asking me,

1193
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,360
Oh,
I'm,

1194
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:42,560
I want to take this [inaudible] stuff.
You,

1195
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,670
you know,
anything about that.

1196
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,920
I'm like,
I do to you.

1197
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,720
Oh yeah.
The guy just told me it's gonna.

1198
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,850
Make me lean.
And everything

1199
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,400
said,
all right,

1200
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:53,970
let me explain what this is.
This is an anabolic steroid and anabolic

1201
00:51:53,971 --> 00:51:57,120
steroid is a derivative of testosterone,
which is a male hormone.

1202
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,540
So what they try to do is minimize the 
androgenic part of the testosterone,

1203
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:06,810
the male like and so you're left with 
more of the anabolic,

1204
00:52:06,811 --> 00:52:11,811
the building part,
but they can't completely minimize the 

1205
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:14,850
androgenic part.
So even though stuff like winstrol Lavar

1206
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,850
is less androgenic men,
testosterone is still derived from a 

1207
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,851
male hormone and if you take off,
you're still going to get the male side 

1208
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:26,841
effects,
which is pretty common in women's 

1209
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:26,841
bodybuilding and fitness and so on.

1210
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,000
It's common in athletics across the 
board.

1211
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,390
We see it in mma.
We see it in women in MMA as well.

1212
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,000
Look,
man,

1213
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:36,330
if you're a competitive sport,
a competitive athlete,

1214
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,100
you're going to do whatever you can do.
You know,

1215
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,150
so when I'm.
There was a study was done by a guy 

1216
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:48,111
called Dr Goldman and it's called 
Goldman's dilemma and he asked a bunch 

1217
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:53,361
of athletes.
I'm including the Olympic level 

1218
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:56,751
athletes,
so if I could give you a pill that would

1219
00:52:56,911 --> 00:53:01,911
guarantee you would win the gold medal 
or whatever the equivalent is in your 

1220
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:02,310
sport,
but you would die at like 40,

1221
00:53:02,311 --> 00:53:03,900
45,
would you take it?

1222
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,920
The vast majority of people said yes,
they would take it.

1223
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,950
That's the mentality you're dealing 
with,

1224
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,050
especially when when you're young man.
Yeah.

1225
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,090
You feel indestructable like nothing's 
gonna,

1226
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:15,630
you know?

1227
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,170
Yeah.
It doesn't seem real to write.

1228
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:20,810
It's like global warming will one day 
make the seas rise.

1229
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:22,130
Yeah,
but not right now.

1230
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:25,350
So fire up the fucking.
Now I want to fucking gold medal.

1231
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:26,310
That's all I'm interested

1232
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:26,940
in.
I'm not even.

1233
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,360
That doesn't even exist.
I'm here now on the fucking gold medal 

1234
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,060
and this is the mentality of the,
you know,

1235
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:38,061
the successful athlete and you know,
maybe it applies to everything or maybe 

1236
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:43,491
it was a fucking businessman if you said
you take this pill and you'll fucking 

1237
00:53:43,491 --> 00:53:43,500
make billions,
like would you do it,

1238
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:49,130
you know,
driven businessman of probably say fuck 

1239
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,130
it,
I'll do it if it's a solution that allow

1240
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,130
you to win.
Yeah.

1241
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,780
Yeah.
So that's what I did.

1242
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:54,540
I,
I consider that I did a calculated risk,

1243
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:00,210
you know,
as far as taking steroids with the 

1244
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,070
possible negative health effects,
which I tried to monitor.

1245
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:02,860
I had doctor's,
you know,

1246
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,550
blood test and everything like that.
So if something was going wrong,

1247
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:07,320
at least out of the,
you know,

1248
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,720
did you ever find anything wrong?
Now,

1249
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:14,750
some things were a little bit out of the
normal range when I was heavy and my 

1250
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,560
blood pressure went up,
like not sky high,

1251
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:17,290
but it was,
you know,

1252
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,410
40 over 90 1:50
over 90.

1253
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:24,410
So it was,
was edging up there but it was 300 

1254
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:24,410
pounds.
So,

1255
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,060
you know,
and um,

1256
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,090
couple of other readings were a little 
bit but nothing of great concern,

1257
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,190
you know?
Um,

1258
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:37,220
but that doesn't mean to say that the 
harmless because it's over a period of 

1259
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:37,220
time.
Right.

1260
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,110
And I equate it to smoking,
you know,

1261
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,400
um,
if you smoke for 10 years and then you 

1262
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,440
stop apparently after 15 or 20 years,
you're back to like,

1263
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,160
you know,
a guy that didn't smoke if you smoke for

1264
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,900
20 years,
25 years,

1265
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,080
and maybe it's a different story.
Have you ever seen Chris Bells 

1266
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,080
documentary bigger,
stronger,

1267
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,600
faster?
I haven't,

1268
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:58,620
no.
I'm,

1269
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,590
I think I'm due to speak with those are 
the brothers,

1270
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:01,900
right?
Yeah.

1271
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,190
Chris and I think I'll be going on the 
podcast at one point,

1272
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:06,800
but I actually haven't watched it.
No.

1273
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,530
Great guys,

1274
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:12,700
really great guys.
They both been on here a couple times 

1275
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,771
and very knowledgeable and Chris is a,
just did a great documentary called 

1276
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:18,680
prescription thugs to about the 
prescription drug industry and you know,

1277
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:22,970
getting people hooked on these pain 
pills but in bigger,

1278
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:23,750
stronger,
faster.

1279
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:27,740
One of the things that was fascinating 
about it was that he was going over,

1280
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,450
like we were told that this is going to 
kill.

1281
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,950
You were told that all these health 
negative health effects,

1282
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,250
he's like,
but where's the bodies?

1283
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,550
Where are the bodies like,
can you think about all the things that 

1284
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:39,550
kill people,
obesity,

1285
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,550
crushes,
human beings.

1286
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,640
I mean,
it is one of the number one causes of 

1287
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:45,640
death in America,
but yet it's looked at

1288
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,360
like smoking alcohol,
prescription drugs.

1289
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,060
Oh,
all those things.

1290
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:53,250
All these things that have been some 
deaths in bodybuilding,

1291
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,360
um,
uh,

1292
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,440
that may be attributed to steroids and 
there's been a couple that definitely 

1293
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,060
attributed to diuretics,
which is,

1294
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,670
you know,
diuretics,

1295
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:04,070
you lose a lot of water,
you,

1296
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,410
you can lose electrolytes,
potassium and sodium,

1297
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:12,830
which regulates your heartbeat.
So then you're playing Russian roulette 

1298
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,711
with a bit on.
A couple of people played that game and 

1299
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:15,711
lost.
So

1300
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:15,711
yeah,
that's an interesting thing to point out

1301
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:17,650
because the diuretic aspect is,
is critical.

1302
00:56:17,651 --> 00:56:21,250
When you see someone on stage and you 
see them shredded,

1303
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,860
those guys are basically almost dead,

1304
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,880
right?
I mean,

1305
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:30,030
you know,
like probably the least healthiest 

1306
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,490
fucking point you've been all year is,
is when you're looking like that on the 

1307
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:32,490
stove.
Amazing.

1308
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,390
You look amazing.
But I can tell you,

1309
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:35,890
you know,
you feel weak as a kitten.

1310
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,090
You don't feel real good at that point,
but you know,

1311
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,890
you do whatever you got to do what's 
required.

1312
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,090
Um,
996 when I was competing,

1313
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:50,110
they had actually a testing for 
diuretics because there was a couple of 

1314
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,470
deaths and the people in charge started 
getting concerned,

1315
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:58,310
you know,
this doesn't look good and that affects 

1316
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:58,310
your revenue.
And so,

1317
00:56:58,310 --> 00:56:59,710
um,
they don't attempt.

1318
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:04,711
They attempted steroid testing in 1990 
but it affected the guys look so much 

1319
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,910
that,
you know,

1320
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:12,930
once you've seen a guy like this,
so once you've seen a guy fight like 

1321
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:13,270
this or once you've seen a guy run this 
fast,

1322
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,780
nobody fucking wants to see anything 
slower than that or less than that.

1323
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,350
Right?
They want,

1324
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:23,370
it's just not interested.
So they realize that real quick like 

1325
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:23,620
fuck list with just forget about the 
steroid testing.

1326
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,590
And anyway,
steroid testing is like,

1327
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,560
it probably just makes it more unfair 
because the guy that's got more 

1328
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,490
information and like the clearance times
and all that stuff,

1329
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,050
they don't want to stop people from 
taking it,

1330
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,880
they're just going to take it and try to
avoid,

1331
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:42,150
get round the test and it's the same in 
all sports and I don't care if it's 

1332
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,750
fucking running,
riding Tour de France,

1333
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,270
whatever it is,
it's going on to some degree.

1334
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,630
What would the UFC has done and they've 
self imposed.

1335
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,940
This is,
they've hired Jeff Novitsky,

1336
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:57,180
the guy who went after Lance Armstrong 
and he's had to Usada and they just do 

1337
00:57:57,731 --> 00:58:01,090
random tests on our ended.
The punishments are terrible,

1338
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,280
like two year suspension.
I mean,

1339
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:06,310
I think first time you get pop,
first time for steroids.

1340
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,650
I think it's a two year suspension now 
for the UFC.

1341
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,520
And this is again,
this is self imposed.

1342
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:15,570
It's not even in Nevada state athletic 
commission or any other athletic 

1343
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:15,570
commissions in positions.
And uh,

1344
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:20,430
they've radically cut back on the amount
of people that are first of all caught 

1345
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,870
in second of all doing steroids.
They're just not doing it,

1346
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,580
but if you do real random testing you 
around.

1347
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,970
Yeah.
Then you have a better chance of 

1348
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,940
eliminating something.
It pisses athletes off because you 

1349
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,340
awaken these fighters up at 6:00
in the morning and they need the rest,

1350
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:38,560
but they take the blood,
they take the urine,

1351
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:43,561
see you go back to sleep and you know,
that way nobody can be safe and you've 

1352
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,050
seen a radical change and performances 
and some athletes have.

1353
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,710
People were suspecting of doing 
steroids.

1354
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:52,950
They changed the way they look like 
there's so many pre and Post Usada 

1355
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,870
pictures of people that post them on 
like twitter and facebook and stuff like

1356
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,790
that where they,
you know,

1357
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:59,500
in these groups where they talk about 
fights and like who's.

1358
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,800
You know what chaff cleats had been hurt
most by Usada.

1359
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,490
Yeah.
It's like,

1360
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,710
it's.
It's interesting because the more of the

1361
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:08,170
bigger guys or it's across the board,
it's bigger guys,

1362
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:13,171
but it's also epo,
like a lot of guys have been popped for 

1363
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:13,171
epo.
They've been popped for.

1364
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,640
What does that other side?
Mel Melatonin.

1365
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:17,320
There's another one,
God dammit,

1366
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,260
I'm trying to remember it,
but it's a similar thing to epo,

1367
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,170
EPO,
increase red blood cell count,

1368
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,900
so you get more oxygen,
which would give you more endurance.

1369
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,650
Yeah,
but that's,

1370
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:27,500
I mean that's giant in the sport.
Yeah.

1371
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:32,501
I mean physical size is not really that 
much of a consideration is very few guys

1372
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,800
that are really big and muscular.

1373
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:38,180
Well here's the thing with steroids.
I mean that can give you muscle size but

1374
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:43,181
it depends on your training,
but the training you're doing so it can 

1375
00:59:43,181 --> 00:59:47,801
also help with their insurance.
So just because the guy is not big and 

1376
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:49,280
muscular doesn't mean there's not 
benefit from steroids.

1377
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:53,090
You get runners and cyclists and like 
Lance Armstrong,

1378
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,550
Armstrong is like,
you know,

1379
00:59:55,551 --> 01:00:00,551
he was on a pedestal and then is 
demonized and is down here like let's 

1380
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,980
say the owner guy using a bit of 
testosterone or you know.

1381
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:04,980
No,
he was a,

1382
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:10,050
you know,
Bill Burr was a good friend of mine and 

1383
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:10,210
stand up comedian had a hilarious bit 
about it and he's like,

1384
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,490
are psychopath was better than you're a 
psychopath.

1385
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,130
You got a dirty sport.
He's like,

1386
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:17,470
we just have one psycho that was more 
psycho.

1387
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,190
You're psycho.

1388
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,750
And uh,
he had testicular cancer,

1389
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:21,470
right?
Yeah.

1390
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:26,590
So I'm assuming then you're not 
producing any testosterone,

1391
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,850
so you've got to have to put it in from 
outside.

1392
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,130
How much?
I don't know.

1393
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,180
Well,
they had it in the used to allow 

1394
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:35,430
testosterone replacement therapy for 
fighters.

1395
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:38,250
They don't allow that anymore because 
guys are abusing it.

1396
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:43,251
And also there was a questions of why 
they were losing testosterone in the 

1397
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:47,241
first place and one of the thoughts was 
damaged to pituitary gland because 

1398
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:49,410
that's apparently a big factor with 
fighters.

1399
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,920
Once they developed damage to the 
pituitary gland from head trauma,

1400
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,760
they start decreasing the amount of 
testosterone in their body produces.

1401
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,270
And so the thought was put it back in,
but other doctors are saying,

1402
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:02,520
well maybe you shouldn't be competing 
anymore.

1403
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:05,070
Maybe put it back in for general health 
and wellness,

1404
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,520
but you probably shouldn't be competing 
anymore if this is the way your body's 

1405
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:10,520
responding to head trauma.

1406
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,420
Yeah.
And it shouldn't really need replacement

1407
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:16,980
testosterone until you're like 40 or 
thereabouts,

1408
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,080
you know,
because it shouldn't be producing still.

1409
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,140
And there's ways to up it,
right?

1410
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:26,240
Even natural supplements to up it.
A despotic asset as long as,

1411
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,610
what is d aspartic acid despotic I said 
as a compound,

1412
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,330
I think it's from amino acids,
but anyway,

1413
01:01:33,331 --> 01:01:38,331
they've done studies on it that shows 
that it can raise your own natural 

1414
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:38,610
testosterone.
Some herbs,

1415
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:42,250
Tribulus Terrestris also has some,
uh,

1416
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:45,600
you know,
some studies to back that up.

1417
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,900
Also exercise,
right?

1418
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,990
Like high intensity exercise,
sprint,

1419
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:53,991
certain kinds of squats.
So how much it's going to make a 

1420
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:53,991
difference.
I don't really know.

1421
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:54,330
But yeah,
heavy,

1422
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,510
heavy exercise would raise the 
testosterone over normal baseline.

1423
01:01:57,511 --> 01:02:00,660
But once it gets to a certain age,
it starts declining.

1424
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,800
In any case,
you know.

1425
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:06,720
Now when you started taking stuff and 
you started off with d ball,

1426
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,670
what?
Like at the height,

1427
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,310
what was the craziest amount of shit you
were taken?

1428
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:15,040
The most stuff I took was in the off 
season when I was trying to real heavy,

1429
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:20,100
trying to build sized because I had to 
raise him that used to get ready for 

1430
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:24,980
contests and I was always known for,
like really coming in in shape.

1431
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:30,560
Um,
so I don't use so much stuff getting 

1432
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,380
ready for a contest you use more in the 
off season,

1433
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:34,890
so like a thousand milligrams of 
testosterone a week.

1434
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:40,100
Um,
some decker to rebel and maybe 500 

1435
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,641
milligrams and Debo maybe 40,
50 milligrams is average and growth 

1436
01:02:43,641 --> 01:02:45,960
hormone in the off season I saw a lot of
shit.

1437
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,610
It's probably about 30 percent of what 
guys are taken now.

1438
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,320
I think so based on what people are 
telling me,

1439
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:00,560
I mean I have people come to train with 
me that haven't even done a competition,

1440
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:06,380
let alone the Mr Olympia and they,
their stack is more than that because 

1441
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:06,990
they found it on the Internet.
I'm like,

1442
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:11,991
what the fuck?
You know why I just saw it on the 

1443
01:03:11,991 --> 01:03:13,970
internet somewhere.
This,

1444
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,060
I mean you go on the Internet and have a
look for Dorian yates stack.

1445
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,670
I mean I've been on there and it's,
I'm like,

1446
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,460
first of all,
50 percent of this stuff,

1447
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:25,140
I don't even know what it is.
Right?

1448
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:30,170
So I don't even know what it is.
And the rest of the stuff that I do 

1449
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:30,170
recognize,
like if you take this,

1450
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,080
you're going to get real health 
problems.

1451
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,840
So like is an issue,
right?

1452
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:38,010
I mean instantly taken too much insulin 
and you fucking kill over in a coma.

1453
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:43,630
Um,
I tried incident in the last couple of 

1454
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:45,620
years.
I was competing because there's a few 

1455
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,021
guys started using it and so on.
And I don't feel that I've benefited 

1456
01:03:48,021 --> 01:03:49,290
from it.
I got a bit bigger,

1457
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:53,040
I got more bloated,
the conditioning was harder to get.

1458
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,960
Um,
so for me,

1459
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,040
I didn't feel I get any benefit from it.
You can get bigger,

1460
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,980
but it's not the quality,
you know,

1461
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,960
it wasn't.
I was known for like Super Hot,

1462
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:06,600
grainy quality and I was,
I was losing a little bit of that.

1463
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,150
He was an insulin.
So that's my opinion.

1464
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:14,180
I wouldn't recommend,
I don't recommend it to people that are 

1465
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,840
trained with because it doesn't have any
real benefits and has,

1466
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,430
has risks go why,
you know,

1467
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,380
that's fascinating.
Like the quality,

1468
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:22,770
like what constitutes the quality of 
muscle that you looking for?

1469
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:23,650
Well,
I,

1470
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,630
I think,
uh,

1471
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:30,140
in my case I was known for muscle 
density so you could have a 20 inch arm 

1472
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,880
that's like got good volume.

1473
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,120
We have 20 inch on the,
it looks like a fucking block of steel.

1474
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,820
So how do you get that look how,
what's the difference?

1475
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,880
I think the differences in the training 
that I've trained very heavy and 

1476
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,630
primarily quite low reps compared to 
bodybuilders.

1477
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,360
I was working in six to eight,
six to eight,

1478
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:49,980
a little bit high on the legs,
10 to 12,

1479
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:55,430
whatever.
Everything I did was like six to eight 

1480
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,961
reps where most of the guys that do 
intend to 12 and they relying more on 

1481
01:04:56,961 --> 01:05:01,131
pumping,
just getting a lot of blood volume into 

1482
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:01,320
the muscle rather than overloading it.
Um,

1483
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,490
so I had a density in a powerful look to
my physique that the other guys,

1484
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:07,080
when they stood next to me,
uh,

1485
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:12,350
they didn't have that.
And that was just from really heavy 

1486
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:15,261
training I think.
So you get the density of the muscle 

1487
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:15,261
rather than just pumping it volume one.

1488
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:18,250
How did you figure out how to make that 
number like six to eight,

1489
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,100
like why not three to five,
like you know what I'm saying?

1490
01:05:21,101 --> 01:05:24,220
Like how did you arrive over over many 
decades.

1491
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:29,790
First of all,
people in the gym and also studies as 

1492
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,240
well.
Most studies would say for muscle growth

1493
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:34,540
you need to keep the muscle under 
tension from about a 40 to 60 seconds,

1494
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,390
which in most cases would be eight to 12
reps,

1495
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,130
so I went a bit lower like six to eight 
a that worked really well for me,

1496
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,200
but not on legs.
I went higher,

1497
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,560
10 or 12 on on the legs.
So just a bit of trial and error.

1498
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:52,990
We know I'm the lower reps will give you
more strength and more power without the

1499
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:59,820
hypertrophy of the growth of the muscle.
So that's ideal for fighters.

1500
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:05,240
I worked with a few fighters in the UK 
and I tried to explain this to them and 

1501
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,340
it's hard for them to grasp because they
think I'm in the ring.

1502
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,390
I'm doing a lot of,
you know,

1503
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,460
I need insurance.
Yeah,

1504
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:10,990
you do,
but you're already doing that.

1505
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,640
You're already doing that,
right?

1506
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:16,240
So if you want to get more power behind 
the punch,

1507
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,570
but you don't want to build muscle 
because if you build muscle,

1508
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:21,340
you put on weight and then you've got 
the white category.

1509
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:26,341
So whatever more power you got,
it's going to be negated by the fact 

1510
01:06:26,341 --> 01:06:28,300
that you fight fighting heavier guys.
So if you could stay the same weight but

1511
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:30,910
be more powerful and stronger with that 
building muscle size,

1512
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:32,470
uh,
that would be the key.

1513
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,800
And that's basically like power lifting,
low reps,

1514
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:39,550
three reps,
and then have a really long rest totally

1515
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,060
foreign to mma training.
You're going to do a bom,

1516
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:43,680
Bom,
bom,

1517
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,850
put it back and wait for three or four 
minutes.

1518
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,110
Yeah,
do it again.

1519
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:50,170
So you get that bar,
the power behind a punch,

1520
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:53,560
but without rest,
but without increasing your muscle size,

1521
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,080
you know,
because that would,

1522
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,260
you know,
if you,

1523
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:58,630
if you get more power behind your punch,
but you're going up a weight class,

1524
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:00,570
like so what,
you know,

1525
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,920
you want to stay in the same weight but 
be stronger.

1526
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,670
That would be ideal for a fighter.
So that seems counterintuitive for a lot

1527
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:09,130
of people because they assume that 
bigger muscles mean more power.

1528
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,140
Not necessarily.
I mean,

1529
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:13,960
bodybuilders have got a bigger muscles 
and power lifters.

1530
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,720
How lyft is going to lift more weight at
least for one or two reps,

1531
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:17,290
you know?
Yeah.

1532
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,790
They're training for that power boom.
Right.

1533
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:22,390
Same thing with weightlifting is a 
couple of reps,

1534
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:27,391
but very explosive and powerful.
That's hard for people understand 

1535
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:27,391
kettlebells as well.
Like,

1536
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:27,940
yeah,
throw it up,

1537
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:28,780
you know?
Oh,

1538
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,850
well that's the thing about kettlebell 
competitors.

1539
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:35,620
They'd not the biggest guys like they,
the internal musculature,

1540
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:37,780
the call.
There's a lot of the lifting,

1541
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:38,540
right?
Yeah.

1542
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:39,820
You know,
uh,

1543
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:44,110
if you're throwing a punch,
I mean who cares if you got huge biceps,

1544
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:46,240
it's like the internal,
right?

1545
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:51,290
It's terrible all the way up through the
call that's going to give you that 

1546
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:51,310
power.
So you've got to go.

1547
01:07:51,311 --> 01:07:55,240
He's like feed or I mean Elanco who?
I'm a huge fan of him.

1548
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,670
I like his fighting style as well,
you know?

1549
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,120
Uh,
I mean the guy looks like he's got arms 

1550
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,570
like sticks is it looks like he's got a 
pot belly,

1551
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,270
it looks out of shape,
but if I can hit like a baseball bat man

1552
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:10,330
early in his career,
he was bigger.

1553
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:15,730
Yeah.
You and he stopped training weights and 

1554
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:15,980
started training only sports specific,
which is,

1555
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:20,540
it's a very controversial subject 
because if you talked to modern strength

1556
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:25,541
and conditioning coaches,
they said it's absolutely the wrong 

1557
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:27,581
approach.
And if a door continued to do strength 

1558
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:28,000
and conditioning along with his martial 
arts training,

1559
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,110
he probably would have been able to 
prolong his career.

1560
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:34,400
But who the fuck knows if that's true?
That seems like a very,

1561
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,420
it's very hard to say what would have 
happened,

1562
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:43,780
but the modern approach seems to be,
do you have to consider strength and 

1563
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:49,301
conditioning as a huge part of any 
regimen in terms of like some of the 

1564
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:54,701
elite athletes focus primarily on 
strength and conditioning and camp and 

1565
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,470
not really unskilled work because they 
feel like they already know how to fight

1566
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,560
as well.
It's already the conditioning.

1567
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,120
It's all about,
um,

1568
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,500
I mean as far as the,
you know,

1569
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:06,950
the conditioning of their emotions and 
their ability to react is already there.

1570
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:12,070
It's just a matter of building the 
ultimate gas tank and having the body 

1571
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:16,421
that can perform and react as quickly 
and as fast and recover as fast as 

1572
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:16,421
possible.

1573
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:21,080
Well,
they've got the guys that hit the 

1574
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,080
hottest that not necessarily the most 
muscular though,

1575
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,080
that's

1576
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,550
some of them are like tyron Woodley,
who's the UFC welterweight champion.

1577
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:29,551
He's one rare guy that kind of violates 
the normal build of a professional mma 

1578
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:36,070
athletes because he's fucking jacked.
But he's also,

1579
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:41,190
he's also very smart in his approach.
Whereas like he's the consequences of 

1580
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:46,141
engaging with him or extreme because he 
has tremendous power so he can pace 

1581
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:52,031
himself more than like maybe some guys 
can because if you get in a firefight 

1582
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:56,341
with him,
like one shot from him put the lights 

1583
01:09:56,341 --> 01:09:57,550
out on you.
So he's got this ability to.

1584
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:02,610
And he's developed a very,
very interesting way of fighting where 

1585
01:10:02,861 --> 01:10:06,910
he just paces his bursts.
But it's bursts are so terrifying.

1586
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,720
Like when he comes at you,
when he can,

1587
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,760
when he does sprint your way so much 
faster than the average fighter and so 

1588
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,481
much stronger that I guess in his mind 
having all that muscle and he says it's 

1589
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:19,860
actually natural.
He just said he and his son.

1590
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:21,970
Is it genetic?
Yeah.

1591
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:27,090
My son is doing bodybuilding and uh,
you don't have a particularly good a 

1592
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,480
fried chicken and burgers and stuff and 
his like shredded all the time.

1593
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:36,590
It will.
Tyron son is jacked and he's a little 

1594
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:36,590
kid and he's parked on genetics are 
real.

1595
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,690
There's no denying.
It's like me.

1596
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,390
When I started I had already a physique,
had the ABS,

1597
01:10:40,391 --> 01:10:41,950
I was laying,
I had the shape.

1598
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:44,860
Everything was there.
Just that to get bigger.

1599
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:48,070
So jeans are a big thing as far as your 
body type.

1600
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:50,250
Oh,
is it insurmountable?

1601
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,760
Like if a guy has shit genes,
can he become like a jack?

1602
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,820
No,
no,

1603
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,770
no.
Whoa.

1604
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,800
It can get better.
Get better.

1605
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:03,230
But you can't be Lee Haney.
It's a rare individual that you know,

1606
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,360
couldn't get up.
And the Mr Olympia stage is probably 

1607
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,270
hundreds of thousands,
maybe millions of guys around the world 

1608
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:13,200
that in the gym training and maybe it 
would like to compete.

1609
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,880
Um,
what do you know,

1610
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:19,780
Kinda kinda everybody be a UFC champion.
Can everybody be a basketball player?

1611
01:11:19,781 --> 01:11:24,781
I know you need certain tools to start 
with and then you've got to work on that

1612
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:25,680
and build that.

1613
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,900
But at least for,
for athletes and fighters in particular,

1614
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:30,820
you see guys who don't have impressive 
physiques had,

1615
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:35,821
have incredible records and wound up 
doing really well with their skill and 

1616
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:37,970
their tactics and their mindset and 
their understanding of when to engage,

1617
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,780
when not to engage with bodybuilding 
dough.

1618
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,300
It's a very specific look if you are 
born with like slope,

1619
01:11:43,301 --> 01:11:45,490
shoulders and small hands and

1620
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:46,880
you're fucked,
right?

1621
01:11:46,881 --> 01:11:48,110
You need to,
first of all,

1622
01:11:48,111 --> 01:11:50,120
you need the frame,
the frame.

1623
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:51,470
You can't,
it's the bone structure.

1624
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:53,450
You can't do anything about that with,
with the training,

1625
01:11:53,451 --> 01:11:58,451
right?
So you need a relatively wide shoulders 

1626
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:02,320
to smaller hips.
You need the limbs to be proportional 

1627
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,530
for bodybuilding.
Um,

1628
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,680
most of the successful guys that tend to
have a little bit longer legs compared 

1629
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,801
to the torso because it just looks more 
authentic and makes the upper body 

1630
01:12:11,801 --> 01:12:12,920
looked more like that.
So that's a bone structure.

1631
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:16,640
You can't do anything about it that you 
need to be born with a bone structure.

1632
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,370
Um,
and then you've got muscle bellies,

1633
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,370
so you got the length of the muscle 
belly,

1634
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,250
which is genetic.
So if you've got a short bicep,

1635
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:30,910
you know,
used to tell you I'll go to the gym and 

1636
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:30,910
do preacher calls and we get along.
No,

1637
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,980
you have your muscle attachments are 
genetic.

1638
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,570
So the longer your muscle bellies are,
the more potential they have for volume.

1639
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:44,110
So somebody that's got uniformly long 
muscle bellies with a good frame and a 

1640
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:47,990
good metabolism that tends to have 
naturally low body fat.

1641
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:53,530
Then you're looking at somebody with 
potential to be a good competitive 

1642
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:53,660
bodybuilder.
If they don't have all those things,

1643
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:57,620
everyone can improve.
But are you going to go win contests?

1644
01:12:57,621 --> 01:12:57,950
No.

1645
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,920
Have you ever had a guy come to you and 
said,

1646
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,660
and I want to be a champion,
and you like kid,

1647
01:13:01,661 --> 01:13:02,080
you're fucked.

1648
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,930
Yeah.
Damn.

1649
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,590
I mean,
why?

1650
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:05,040
You know,

1651
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:10,220
Dorian Yates tells you you're fucked.
I don't say I try to be a little bit 

1652
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,380
more subtle than that,
but uh,

1653
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:12,760
I'm like,

1654
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:16,630
you know,
I don't,

1655
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,220
I'm not here to bullshit anybody.
So if somebody asks me,

1656
01:13:19,221 --> 01:13:20,360
I'm just going to tell him like,
yeah,

1657
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:21,840
you can improve man.
But like,

1658
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:26,890
you know,
you're just going to waste your time if 

1659
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:26,890
you're driven by a Mr Olympia because,
you know,

1660
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:27,590
I don't be rude,
but you just,

1661
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,030
you just don't have what it takes.
Like enjoy your training.

1662
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,640
Shouldn't be healthy.
You have fun in the gym.

1663
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,430
But yeah,
forgot about that because it's not going

1664
01:13:37,431 --> 01:13:39,140
to happen.
That's hard for people to hear though,

1665
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,470
but it's better than me blowing smoke up
their ass and saying,

1666
01:13:42,471 --> 01:13:43,130
yeah,
Oh yeah,

1667
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:43,990
you know,
yeah,

1668
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,350
pay me.
And Yeah,

1669
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:47,060
you can be.
You can have whatever you want,

1670
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:52,090
man,
because somebody else is going to tell 

1671
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:52,090
him that.

1672
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:52,090
Have you seen a guy that you thought,
man,

1673
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:53,640
I don't think so,
and then he became a great bodybuilder?

1674
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,390
No,
no,

1675
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:56,310
no.
Jesus Christ.

1676
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,260
I can pretty much.
I mean I've been around like,

1677
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:00,590
you know,
what,

1678
01:14:00,591 --> 01:14:05,591
a 35 years I've been in this guy man,
so I can see people and I've seen people

1679
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:11,570
probably with more potential than me.
Well they don't get anywhere because 

1680
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:12,100
they don't apply.
So it's,

1681
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,740
you know,
you've got to have the physical stuff,

1682
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:19,890
but the glue,
the thing that holds it all together is 

1683
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:20,860
this.
So I've seen freaks in a gym,

1684
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,160
but they,
you know,

1685
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:24,310
first of all,
they're not that smart.

1686
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,580
They don't really understand everything 
that's going on.

1687
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,150
Um,
and usually when somebody gets something

1688
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:32,920
real easy,
they're not,

1689
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:34,990
they're not really that hungry.
Right?

1690
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:39,520
So it's not necessarily always the guy 
with the most potential that,

1691
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:44,950
you know,
you can beat somebody with more 

1692
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,950
potential by being smarter and working 
hard,

1693
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,950
but it's,
you know,

1694
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:46,810
72 degrees,
right?

1695
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:52,110
Yeah.
That's what I've always said that like 

1696
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:52,110
you can get a guy who's the most 
dedicated,

1697
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,621
the most hungry wanted the most,
but when you're competing in basketball 

1698
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:56,640
against Michael Jordan,
yeah,

1699
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,800
you're kind of fucked because he wants 
it bad too and his genetics are just so 

1700
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,330
superior.
There's just no way around.

1701
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,920
So you can't equalize that.
Well,

1702
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:05,840
what are you going to do?
You know,

1703
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,750
I saw this thing in England recently.
Guy came over from the states,

1704
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,860
the real,
I don't know what his name was,

1705
01:15:11,861 --> 01:15:13,690
but it was a good martial arts.
It was a kickbox.

1706
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,520
He was dedicated.
It was lean and fit,

1707
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:21,120
and it came over to fight this gypsy 
fight or over in England and this guy's 

1708
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,780
like fat out of shape.
He turned up like 45 minutes late for 

1709
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:28,801
the flight because it had been drunk the
night before and he came in and it's 

1710
01:15:28,801 --> 01:15:31,510
just fat and it looked like shit and an 
for like half an hour.

1711
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:33,130
He's getting his ass kicked.
Well,

1712
01:15:33,131 --> 01:15:34,350
they're not thinking,
oh,

1713
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:37,630
he woke up and it kicked the other guy's
s.

1714
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,720
So this guy has been training,
has been dedicated as he's doing all 

1715
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,020
this stuff and this guy is the night 
before is getting drunk,

1716
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:45,940
but he still come in and kick the guy's 
us.

1717
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:50,940
So you know,
it probably just had more potential or 

1718
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:50,940
he had a hot head or something.
I don't know.

1719
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,810
There's a lot of factors involved in 
fighting.

1720
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,080
I mean his experience,
his ability to take punishment that some

1721
01:15:56,081 --> 01:16:01,081
of it is just inherent.
Like some people just have a like a 

1722
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:01,840
wider face,
stronger neck.

1723
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,460
They can take a shot better.
Yeah.

1724
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,600
There's oral genetic characteristics,
right?

1725
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:09,670
The ability to absorb punches,
it seems to be,

1726
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,140
or at least the variables seem to be a 
lot of it based on maybe you've got sick

1727
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:17,820
of bones or a shorter neck so your brain
doesn't rattle as much or something.

1728
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:22,830
Mark is a perfect example.
That is one of the best kick boxers of 

1729
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:25,741
all time.
And from New Zealand just to tank of a 

1730
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:25,741
man,
you know,

1731
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:29,700
five foot 10,
265 pounds just built like a brick 

1732
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,760
shithouse oh dude.

1733
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:35,760
Cro.
Cop had kicked him and he went down and 

1734
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:35,800
got right back up.
It's like nobody does a cro.

1735
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:37,630
Cop had cakes you.
That's a wrap,

1736
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:42,660
you know,
and he's one of the few guys that 

1737
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:42,660
survived it.
Well,

1738
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:43,660
I got a my friend,
my business partner from New Zealand,

1739
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:47,020
I don't know if it's true,
but he told me about Malcolm is I've got

1740
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:52,021
a brother and the dad used to get them 
in the back yard there and just like 

1741
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:55,600
knock the shit out of each other until 
they're like immune to getting hit.

1742
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:57,070
Yeah.
I don't feel it anymore.

1743
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:02,280
Well,
he's been knocked out a few times 

1744
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:02,280
recently like,
but you know,

1745
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:02,830
he's in his forties now.
It isn't it the case with fighters?

1746
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:03,870
I don't know.
I noticed that.

1747
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:08,871
Anyway,
you get a guy that's like seems to be 

1748
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:10,921
invincible,
then it gets knocked out and then after 

1749
01:17:10,921 --> 01:17:10,921
that he it like

1750
01:17:10,921 --> 01:17:12,740
chocolate down for instance.
Perfect example.

1751
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,230
Yeah.
Unquestioned.

1752
01:17:14,231 --> 01:17:14,720
What is that?

1753
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:20,300
Well,
your brain does not want to take that 

1754
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,971
kind of punishment anymore.
And with Chuck explained to me was that 

1755
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:27,260
when it gets to a point where your brain
realizes that you're too tough and 

1756
01:17:28,381 --> 01:17:33,090
you're just going to absorb this 
punishment and it just shuts itself down

1757
01:17:33,091 --> 01:17:36,360
to protect it.
And that's how he described it now.

1758
01:17:36,361 --> 01:17:39,180
And obviously that's not like a 
neuroscientist describing it.

1759
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,360
There's also the connective tissue that 
keeps the brain connected and inside 

1760
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,240
that it gets looser and more torn.
Have you ever seen connective tissue?

1761
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:53,241
It's almost like a,
like a strong version of cotton candy 

1762
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:54,150
is.
It looks like it's not.

1763
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:59,540
It's not the toughest stuff in the world
and it's not supposed to take that many 

1764
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:03,621
beatings in the wild.
If you had that many beatings over a 

1765
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:04,350
certain point that you'd be dead 
already,

1766
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:05,640
somebody would've already eaten you.

1767
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,920
But a MMA seems to be safer than boxing 
because you don't hit as many times

1768
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:14,850
sorta.
Yeah,

1769
01:18:14,851 --> 01:18:19,851
I would say probably overall safer.
But that's like saying motorcycle racing

1770
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:26,210
is safer than like going down hill and a
skateboard 60 miles an hour.

1771
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:28,470
You're kind of fucked all relative,
right?

1772
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:33,471
Yeah.
It's like the study that they did that 

1773
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,860
just came out this week on football 
players would show they did.

1774
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:39,861
They,
they did a test on 111 fighters are 111 

1775
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:44,721
football players.
One hundred and 10 had traumatic brain 

1776
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:44,721
injuries.

1777
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:48,550
I saw the movie account numbers called 
now with the brain damage was causing 

1778
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:52,280
the guys to be violent and kind of 
stuff.

1779
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:57,281
I mean,
they were saying that 87 percent of 

1780
01:18:57,281 --> 01:18:57,980
football players at all levels,
high school,

1781
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:00,070
college,
all,

1782
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:04,370
all levels have traumatic brain injury.
80 seven percent of what you're going to

1783
01:19:04,371 --> 01:19:08,810
do stop exact club football and stuff.
MMA like that's the question.

1784
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,550
Climb Kleiman like,
you know,

1785
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:13,340
everything's got its uh,
its risks,

1786
01:19:13,341 --> 01:19:13,910
right?
Every,

1787
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:15,410
every sport,
unless you do it like,

1788
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,330
you know,
moderately.

1789
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:22,930
If you do things in moderation that good
but could never be dorian yates in 

1790
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,410
moderation,
competitive sports or not,

1791
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,200
you know,
they're not the healthiest thing in the 

1792
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,200
world right now.

1793
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,200
No,
I mean,

1794
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,200
you're dealing.
Well,

1795
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,651
I mean,
I guess there's injuries involved in 

1796
01:19:34,651 --> 01:19:34,651
basketball,
right?

1797
01:19:34,651 --> 01:19:35,350
But you know,
you're not,

1798
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:37,630
you're going to lose your ability to 
think.

1799
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,000
But uh,
even like endurance sports,

1800
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:45,060
a marathon run and stuff like that,
these guys die younger than incidental 

1801
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,280
person.
Yeah.

1802
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:51,130
Because of the massive amount of free 
radicals that are producing,

1803
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:56,170
which is aging the cells from massive 
free radical from all this oxygen like 

1804
01:19:56,531 --> 01:19:58,270
uh,
so you know,

1805
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,140
you,
your agent,

1806
01:19:59,141 --> 01:20:04,141
if Salads,
you're wearing yourself out doing all 

1807
01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:04,141
this interference sports.
Um,

1808
01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:05,290
I think what's going to come out in the 
future,

1809
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:10,291
and I've been doing this myself and 
getting great results is very short 

1810
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:14,500
interval training now they've done 
studies with five minutes of cardio 

1811
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,020
workout and it's getting the same 
results as an hour.

1812
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,100
Well that's,
yeah,

1813
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,540
I do 10 minutes.
I do what I do a 90 seconds,

1814
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:22,510
like,
you know,

1815
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,110
moderate.
Then I do a 32nd all out sprint,

1816
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:28,380
whether it's on a cross trainer or a 
rower or kettle bells or whatever,

1817
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,960
get the heart rate right up,
like one 60 or something.

1818
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,570
And then go back down to do that a few 
times,

1819
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:38,571
like 10 or 12 minutes.
And my resting heart rate was pretty 

1820
01:20:38,571 --> 01:20:40,260
good for a bodybuilder.
I guess it was like 50 4:55

1821
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:43,050
in the morning.
I had it down to like low forties,

1822
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:48,051
45 in the morning and that's just from 
doing a couple of times a week or 10 

1823
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:50,400
minute workout and once a week I do a 
hard bike ride,

1824
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:53,570
but yeah,
absolutely because you want to get the.

1825
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:56,130
You want to get the benefits from the 
cardio exercise,

1826
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,620
which is a more efficient cardiovascular
system,

1827
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,380
but you don't want the negatives for 
that free radical.

1828
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,370
So if you can get what you're looking 
for in a 10 minute workout,

1829
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,750
what are you going to do?
An hour or two hours.

1830
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:11,870
I don't know if it would be useful for a
fighter because you're going to be in a 

1831
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:12,750
ring for all that long,
so you've got to condition yourself with

1832
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:14,650
that.
Just talking about for,

1833
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:17,430
for general health.
Wow.

1834
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,380
I've never even heard of such a thing.
Yeah.

1835
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:21,390
Interval training,
but 10 minutes,

1836
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:26,450
10 minutes.
They've done studies on the four and 

1837
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:26,450
five minute workout.
So that's.

1838
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:28,770
I think that's the future where you 
know,

1839
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:31,830
you want to get the benefit without the 
negatives.

1840
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,540
Do you think you could run a marathon 
right now?

1841
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,310
Could I run a marathon?
No.

1842
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,990
No,
I running is not.

1843
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,460
Not For me now.
Well not definitely not for you.

1844
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,210
When you're in your prime fast walking.
That's good.

1845
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,380
When you were in your prime,
how much endurance did you have?

1846
01:21:45,381 --> 01:21:47,540
Like if you had to do something,
if you had to go up a flight of stairs.

1847
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,500
We like to

1848
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:53,720
bad because I always did some cardio.
I did some cardio and stretching and so 

1849
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:57,140
it was a bit unusual for,
for bodybuilders because that doesn't 

1850
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,530
give you bigger muscles,
but I saw the other benefits of it 

1851
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:03,300
because if I got more efficient cardio,
like I'm training legs and back,

1852
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:08,301
stuff like that.
That's a huge amount of oxygen and you 

1853
01:22:08,301 --> 01:22:08,520
got to failure on squats or leg presses,
you know,

1854
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:11,340
that's a huge amount of oxygen.
So for me to recover from that,

1855
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,400
I needed a bit of a cardio so I was 
doing three or four times a week off 

1856
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,940
season every day getting ready for a 
contest,

1857
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,160
but it wasn't very intense.
It was more like moderate.

1858
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:24,900
I did like fast walking for an hour or 
do stationary bike for 45 minutes,

1859
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,140
sometimes twice a day.
So I was doing quite a lot of cardio 

1860
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,451
work,
getting ready for a contest rather than 

1861
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:32,451
starving myself.
Oh,

1862
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:36,250
I see.
I was bringing the calories down a 

1863
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:36,250
little bit and bring the activity of a 
little bit.

1864
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:36,930
So it was a bit of both.
A bit of calorie restriction,

1865
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:40,680
a bit of more activity,
more calorie burning

1866
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:44,830
now when you do in calorie restriction,
but you also have to keep all that mass.

1867
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:47,740
How did you contradictory goals?
Yeah,

1868
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,660
uh,
you know,

1869
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,400
training we can debate because I trained
with some mma guys in England,

1870
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:59,240
a bit of Jujitsu,
but mainly conditioning stuff and it's 

1871
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,990
fucking hard man.
It's hard training,

1872
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:05,991
right?
He's just a super hard cardio and then 

1873
01:23:05,991 --> 01:23:05,991
someone's trying to punch you in the 
face at the same time.

1874
01:23:05,991 --> 01:23:07,450
That's hard.
So we can debate about the training.

1875
01:23:07,451 --> 01:23:08,740
Which sport is harder?
Yeah,

1876
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:11,400
because I've done a little bit of both.
Um,

1877
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,680
but what's harder and bodybuilding is 
when you leave the gym,

1878
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,160
it's still with you and when you're 
getting ready for a contest,

1879
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:22,000
you're going to do more training and 
you're going to eat less.

1880
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,830
So most sports,
if you try,

1881
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,610
you can go train hard and then you can 
go home and eat with bodybuilding,

1882
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:29,740
you know,
two months before a contest,

1883
01:23:29,741 --> 01:23:34,741
you,
you're hungry all the time because 

1884
01:23:34,741 --> 01:23:34,741
you're trying to lose,
you're trying to lose,

1885
01:23:34,741 --> 01:23:36,730
slowly lose the body fat and maintain 
muscle.

1886
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,590
If you're trying to lose weight too 
quickly,

1887
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:41,440
your body will preferentially burn a 
muscle because it's like,

1888
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:44,290
what is an emergency store,
right?

1889
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:49,350
Your body doesn't want to give it up.
So you've got to like coax it out 

1890
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,350
slowly,
you know?

1891
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,600
Um,
but yeah,

1892
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:54,601
you're going to be hungry and you're 
gonna be tired for a couple of months 

1893
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:57,271
ago for a,
for a contest that isn't selling fun is 

1894
01:23:57,271 --> 01:23:57,271
not fun,
man.

1895
01:23:57,271 --> 01:24:01,830
It's,
it's a constant mental battle as well 

1896
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:03,280
because your body's telling you to eat,
you gotta eat,

1897
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:08,281
you gotta eat and at night you can't 
sleep properly because you got to sleep 

1898
01:24:08,281 --> 01:24:08,300
a little bit.
And then your body's like,

1899
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,850
internal alarm clock will wake you up if
I can stop and go eat and you're like,

1900
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,210
nope,

1901
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:18,400
I ain't doing that.
But how do you keep your body from 

1902
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:18,550
absorbing all that muscle because you're
carrying so much muscle?

1903
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:21,200
Is there a drug that you can take that 
keeps the mass?

1904
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,600
Well,
you know you're taking steroids which 

1905
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:26,600
are anti,
which are anabolic and anti catabolic.

1906
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,740
So that's going to stop you from losing 
muscle.

1907
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,080
However,
you know,

1908
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:35,370
if you restrict your calories too much 
or too much exercise and none of it,

1909
01:24:35,371 --> 01:24:38,550
you still going to burn muscle is just 
going to lower the chances of it.

1910
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:43,730
So you know,
you've got to stack everything in your 

1911
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:43,730
favor.
You've taken steroids is,

1912
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:48,440
you know,
try to keep the muscle mass and stop 

1913
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:48,440
losing it.
But if you do restrict too much,

1914
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,680
you're going to,
you're still gonna lose it.

1915
01:24:49,681 --> 01:24:53,640
So you need to like one or two pounds a 
week very slowly.

1916
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,730
Your body from going into the shock.
Yeah.

1917
01:24:56,731 --> 01:25:00,270
That's where a lot of fighters go wrong 
because they're starved themselves for a

1918
01:25:00,271 --> 01:25:02,300
couple of weeks and lose muscle.
The Lou strength,

1919
01:25:02,301 --> 01:25:05,640
I lose glasses in front of muscle and 
you know they're weaker.

1920
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:06,860
Yeah,
they fight very weak.

1921
01:25:06,861 --> 01:25:11,861
That's,
that's a huge issue and a lot of 

1922
01:25:11,861 --> 01:25:12,630
fighters are choosing to go up a weight 
class and they're having big success.

1923
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,450
Donald cerrone's,
great example that it's been quite a few

1924
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:16,350
fighters.
Oh,

1925
01:25:16,351 --> 01:25:18,630
you lose it.
You lose that weight very slowly.

1926
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:24,080
Not Depleting it down.
Know what kind of diet where you want 

1927
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:24,080
when you were competing

1928
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,870
for a high protein,
high protein,

1929
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:28,300
a off season.
There's still a lot of cops,

1930
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,820
major and fat and then getting ready for
a contest.

1931
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:35,821
The cops slowly come down,
but I was a big guy to 70 to 80.

1932
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:41,620
I was still eating probably 3,500
calories a day,

1933
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:46,780
which is probably more than eight now.
But you know when you're that big you,

1934
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,440
you're starving

1935
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,320
because what do you weigh now?
A way now to 30,

1936
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:51,700
something like that.
So yeah,

1937
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:54,430
all that extra mass needed to be fueled.
Yeah,

1938
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,870
exactly.
Now what,

1939
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:00,340
when you were in say like out of contest
now,

1940
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:04,160
what your goals were to put on muscle 
that you would eventually

1941
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,020
like you would get bigger and bigger 
every year.

1942
01:26:06,021 --> 01:26:07,050
That was one of the things it

1943
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:12,470
so yeah,
and then maybe there's certain areas 

1944
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:14,631
where you want to like work on at some 
point that's a bit behind so you put 

1945
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:18,801
more focus on that and a bit less on 
something else to try and keep the 

1946
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:19,170
balance.
Uh,

1947
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:23,410
it might sound strange now,
but when I first competed a,

1948
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:28,460
my first contest I lost to a guy called 
Mohammed bin Aziza and his back was just

1949
01:26:28,621 --> 01:26:33,621
like freaky thick.
It was like three d coming out and that 

1950
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:33,621
just stuck in my mind.
I'm like,

1951
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,240
fuck that.
I got to,

1952
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,260
I put a picture of him on my fridge at 
home.

1953
01:26:37,261 --> 01:26:41,010
I put a picture in the gym and a funny 
enough,

1954
01:26:41,011 --> 01:26:46,011
later on in my career I became known for
the guy with the best back kind of 

1955
01:26:46,011 --> 01:26:46,560
thing.
So,

1956
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,300
um,
yeah,

1957
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:50,100
it was inspired by other people to do 
that.

1958
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,440
So I worked on the back for a couple of 
years.

1959
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:57,550
What is the difference between the way 
you approach nutrition when you were 

1960
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,120
competing versus the way people do it 
today?

1961
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:04,480
Because so much changes in nutrition.
I mean it seems like every five or six 

1962
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,090
years like,
oh nope.

1963
01:27:05,091 --> 01:27:08,780
Low fats out now you go high fat,
high carbs around,

1964
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:11,570
now you go low carbs and it could change
back and forth again.

1965
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,480
I think the seven is like Arnold area,
Frank Zane,

1966
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:18,480
they'd go more low carbs getting ready 
for a contest,

1967
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:23,160
but then you lose sizemore quickly.
Um,

1968
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:26,660
why do you lose sizemore quicker that 
way because you get caught that ball do,

1969
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,300
you haven't got the energy.
So you know,

1970
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,810
your body can use the amino acid from 
muscle for energy.

1971
01:27:30,811 --> 01:27:34,380
So there's a balance there.
And also you lose the glycogen storage.

1972
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:39,280
It muscle is a 70 percent water and the 
water holds um,

1973
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:42,720
carbohydrates and the muscle glycogen.
So you lose that as well.

1974
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:45,740
So you lose that bit of volume when you 
lose the glycerin,

1975
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,360
you lose the water.
So shrink down a little bit.

1976
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,700
Um,
so my approach was more,

1977
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:52,140
it was high,
higher carbohydrates,

1978
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:58,640
especially in the off season,
getting ready for a contest to cut them 

1979
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:58,640
down,
but not,

1980
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,690
you know,
not zero and a fairly low fat.

1981
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:05,340
I think people now realize that fats 
more important and there's probably more

1982
01:28:05,341 --> 01:28:08,100
fat in the Diet than there was back 
then,

1983
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:09,270
uh,
which,

1984
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:14,670
which I think is healthy fats just got a
bad rap and it's bullshit,

1985
01:28:14,671 --> 01:28:14,910
you know.

1986
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:15,760
Well,
that's,

1987
01:28:15,761 --> 01:28:17,800
um,
we've talked about that several times in

1988
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:22,801
the podcast,
but there was a New York Times article 

1989
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:24,010
recently about how the sugar industry 
paid off scientists to fake results.

1990
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:29,430
And that was done in the,
I get the fifties or sixties and that's 

1991
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,660
haunted people to this day.
They think that fats are bad for you.

1992
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,170
They're essential.

1993
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:38,500
I may be wrong with the organization,
but I think it was World Health 

1994
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:38,610
Organization.
They,

1995
01:28:38,611 --> 01:28:43,611
uh,
basically submitted a study that showed 

1996
01:28:43,611 --> 01:28:45,870
how bad sugar was and some department of
the US government,

1997
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:50,850
which is getting a lot of money from the
sugar lobby basically said,

1998
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:54,000
I think you want to reconsider this,
you know,

1999
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:58,740
kind of like.
So that's where the whole fats are bad,

2000
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,540
you know,
low fat came from.

2001
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:06,200
I know back then how bad sugar is.
So I found it amusing when I first came 

2002
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:10,050
to the states in 1990 got all these low 
fat products.

2003
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,050
I've called my friends at homeland.
How fucked up this is,

2004
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:14,640
man.
They got low fat muffins.

2005
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,520
Of course the fucking low fat.
They're full of sugar,

2006
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:21,390
no fat,
low fat yogurt,

2007
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:23,690
low fat muffins.
It's fucking full of sugar.

2008
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,320
It's the worst thing you could have,
you know.

2009
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:30,321
So people thought they were being 
healthy but they've been misled and it 

2010
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:30,321
makes you fat.
Yeah.

2011
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:31,800
Nothing wrong with fats as long as their
natural,

2012
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:37,280
you know,
if you get the fats in baked goods and 

2013
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,500
all this shit,
you know that that's not good,

2014
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:42,060
but natural fats in animal products and 
coconuts and all that stuff,

2015
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,440
it's great.

2016
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:46,080
Now what would you use for 
carbohydrates?

2017
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:51,081
So you.
Did you have a preferred method or did 

2018
01:29:51,081 --> 01:29:51,081
you

2019
01:29:51,081 --> 01:29:51,860
complex stuff like a oatmeal was a big 
thing.

2020
01:29:51,861 --> 01:29:56,570
He was an oatmeal brown rice,
sweet potatoes and some fruit and fiber,

2021
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:58,810
vegetables.
Those are the main things that I use.

2022
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,140
Basic,
nothing fancy,

2023
01:30:00,141 --> 01:30:00,380
you know,

2024
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:05,560
did you mix your portions up and like a 
little tupperware boxes or something 

2025
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,170
like that so that you could know exactly
what to eat.

2026
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:11,290
I used to weigh my food like pretty much
all the time other than nate and 

2027
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:12,950
restaurants.
Very rarely and yeah,

2028
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:16,160
I used to pack them up in boxes because 
you know,

2029
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,750
you've got to have it all the time.
Right?

2030
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,300
Yeah.
So that was one of the things I did Miss

2031
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:25,310
Miss Mountain so relieved and I carried 
on a fucking plastic boxes around with 

2032
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:28,220
food and just go to a restaurant and eat
whatever I want and have an ice cream if

2033
01:30:28,221 --> 01:30:29,150
you will do.
Exactly.

2034
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:33,050
That must've been nice when you realize 
you could just just eat.

2035
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:38,440
Yeah,
I'm off season wasn't too bad because 

2036
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:38,440
I'm eaten good food,
but a lot of it.

2037
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,770
But yeah,
getting ready for a contest.

2038
01:30:39,771 --> 01:30:44,290
I mean that was a real mental test,
you know,

2039
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,500
because your whole body is telling you 
you got to eat man.

2040
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:49,010
Even at night I said,
you wake up,

2041
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:50,360
you got to eat.
No,

2042
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:55,361
no.
And I'm going to eat and when to watch 

2043
01:30:55,361 --> 01:30:55,361
MTV for half an hour from maybe fall 
back to sleep a little bit,

2044
01:30:55,361 --> 01:30:55,850
hopefully,
you know.

2045
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:57,620
Um,
so yeah,

2046
01:30:57,621 --> 01:31:00,770
the Diet thing,
I don't miss that at all.

2047
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,800
It was,
it was a tough mental challenge and I 

2048
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:05,800
did it.
And you know,

2049
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,590
whenever you get through a challenge I 
think it makes you stronger.

2050
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:08,250
But uh,
you know,

2051
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:10,010
I don't want to ever do that again.
Yeah.

2052
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:10,940
I can only imagine

2053
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,560
now when you give these seminars and he 
talks to these,

2054
01:31:15,561 --> 01:31:17,750
uh,
young bodybuilders that are coming up,

2055
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:23,170
how do you be.
You kind of have sort of a holistic 

2056
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:23,990
approach to life down there just about 
health and wellness and.

2057
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:29,500
But when you were coaching,
these kids are talking to these kids 

2058
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,780
about how to be successful and 
competitive body is a multiple time.

2059
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:34,700
Mr Olympia one of the greatest of all 
time,

2060
01:31:34,701 --> 01:31:39,701
if not the greatest.
You mean you can't have a holistic 

2061
01:31:39,701 --> 01:31:40,040
approach?
Kenya,

2062
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:40,140
you

2063
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:46,490
to me for bodybuilding advice,
and I don't have the body now 

2064
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:51,000
necessarily,
but I got all the information here that 

2065
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,180
I can put across to people for the 
training for the nutrition,

2066
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:54,280
but it's called specific,
you know,

2067
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,140
you want to be a competitive 
bodybuilder.

2068
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:59,320
This is what you got to do.
I'm not a competitive bodybuilder now.

2069
01:31:59,321 --> 01:32:00,070
My Diet and

2070
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,620
my training is geared towards what my 
goals are,

2071
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:06,550
which is functionality,
a health and wellbeing.

2072
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:08,050
And that's,
that's what I'm into now.

2073
01:32:08,051 --> 01:32:10,280
That's where I'm at.
I'm not a bodybuilder anymore,

2074
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:14,250
you know,
and buddy reduce or if anything and um,

2075
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,420
I,
I feel good man.

2076
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:21,421
I'll fucking get a suit from Hugo boss a
couple of months ago off the rack and 

2077
01:32:21,491 --> 01:32:26,491
this was like so happy I could just buy 
a suit off the rack before it had to 

2078
01:32:27,101 --> 01:32:30,080
have it made and if it go for a fitting 
and go for another fitting all that.

2079
01:32:30,081 --> 01:32:32,200
I'm sure if they looked at the 
measurements of paper,

2080
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:34,520
they were like,
what the flight suit suited for?

2081
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:35,410
What is this,
you know,

2082
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:38,440
was like this wide going down,
this is a wardrobe.

2083
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:39,580
What is it,
you know,

2084
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,560
so uh,
yeah,

2085
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:43,060
I look on the other side of it,
you know,

2086
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:46,200
the young guys coming up,
maybe they think less strange like,

2087
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:49,300
and asked me don't you dare look at 
pitches back and think wow,

2088
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:49,900
look like that.

2089
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:50,560
I'm like,
no,

2090
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,380
I don't look at.
I just look at that and I think wow,

2091
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:57,090
that was fucking extreme and what I did.
And that's craziness and credible,

2092
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:02,160
but does it always you as far as 
competition and let yourself like that.

2093
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:04,720
Sometimes when I look at those black and
white pictures,

2094
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:08,450
giant picture of Dorian Yates and is one
of those black and white pictures man.

2095
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:11,470
And that's just like hear you saying,
there it is.

2096
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,740
Look at that.
That's insane man.

2097
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:19,330
He couldn't really fit any more muscle 
onto that frame really.

2098
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:24,670
You know,
like I know I went to places and I did 

2099
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:25,690
things that other people,
you know in the gym,

2100
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:29,080
look at your fucking forearms while my,
here's the thing,

2101
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:32,110
forums.
I never did any training for forums.

2102
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:37,111
All that was just from gripping the ball
when I was doing back training mainly 

2103
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:42,270
and some bicep training and stuff.
So I had 19 inch forums and identity to 

2104
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:46,111
a single fucking exercise for them apart
from gripping onto that is so 

2105
01:33:46,111 --> 01:33:50,761
ridiculous.
Well that's a good pitcher but is not 

2106
01:33:50,761 --> 01:33:50,761
me.

2107
01:33:50,761 --> 01:33:55,590
I don't know how dare you Jamie,
pull up a non Dorian because somebody 

2108
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:59,350
put it on Google.
Put up that winches.

2109
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,530
Keep going to your right.
No,

2110
01:34:00,531 --> 01:34:00,850
no,
no.

2111
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,270
Down what you were.
Yeah.

2112
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,520
To right.
One more.

2113
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:04,480
That one.
Bam.

2114
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:09,481
So I trust it.
That's from the onstage pitcher from Mr 

2115
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,170
Olympia.
So what you can see,

2116
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:14,740
if you look on the legs,
you can see the thinness of the skin and

2117
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,380
the institute with the muscle underneath
like this.

2118
01:34:17,381 --> 01:34:22,381
No fat.
There's no water between the skin layer 

2119
01:34:22,381 --> 01:34:22,381
and the and the muscle layer.
Um,

2120
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:25,930
what body,
but what percent of body fat did you get

2121
01:34:25,931 --> 01:34:27,640
down to?
Well,

2122
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:32,641
I don't really know because I had 
skinfold calipers used to do full 

2123
01:34:32,641 --> 01:34:32,641
calipers.
And you're not accurate.

2124
01:34:32,641 --> 01:34:34,480
They used to get down to like three 
point five,

2125
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:38,260
probably like a month out.
But I know I got leaner after that,

2126
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:43,261
but it didn't really register because 
they're not that accurate after that 

2127
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:43,261
point.
So I don't know,

2128
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:46,210
maybe three percent,
but it's,

2129
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:51,420
you know,
nobody measures your body fat is what 

2130
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:51,420
you look like.
It's a visual thing.

2131
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:51,670
It's really what you look like in the 
mirror.

2132
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:56,671
But how did you know like how much water
to drink and when to back off and um,

2133
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:58,730
experience.

2134
01:34:58,730 --> 01:34:59,990
I didn't really,
uh,

2135
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:01,220
your fucking legs,
dude.

2136
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:06,280
I didn't restrict a water intake until 
like maybe 24 hours before the contest.

2137
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,440
Little your right leg there.
That's preposterous.

2138
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,990
Yeah,
that's a huge media.

2139
01:35:10,991 --> 01:35:13,080
Alice right over the knee.
The,

2140
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:17,540
that's a lot of sick work,
man.

2141
01:35:17,541 --> 01:35:22,541
That's like,
that's like I used to try and legs 

2142
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:26,890
pretty much once a week and for four or 
five days of every week I had trouble 

2143
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:31,280
sitting on the toilet.
Trouble moving around.

2144
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,990
I mean if I didn't,
I wouldn't be happy,

2145
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:34,700
man.
That's a field that fucking pain,

2146
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,460
pain in the ass,
pain in the leg just to sit down.

2147
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,130
But hey,
satisfying because you know,

2148
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:45,131
you fucking done some damage.
But if it's like that and the damage 

2149
01:35:45,131 --> 01:35:47,690
repairs itself to get slightly bigger 
and stronger bodybuilders,

2150
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,080
just an adaptation to stress,
you know,

2151
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:52,220
you put a certain stress,
your body's going to adapt to it.

2152
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:57,250
Fuck,
I need to get bigger and stronger so I 

2153
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:57,860
can handle this stress next time.
That's basically what it is.

2154
01:35:57,861 --> 01:36:02,180
So continually trying to stress yourself
like anything you want to get better.

2155
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:07,190
Katia,
go to express your cardio system so it 

2156
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:07,190
adapts.

2157
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:07,190
Yeah.
There's no other way,

2158
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:07,510
right?
To get that big.

2159
01:36:07,511 --> 01:36:09,760
I mean there's no shortcuts.
There's nothing you can do.

2160
01:36:09,761 --> 01:36:11,110
There's no easy route.

2161
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:12,410
Well,
I don't know.

2162
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:17,590
It looks like guys are looking for the 
easy route now because I don't see them 

2163
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:20,261
train that hard.
But then you don't see the quality of 

2164
01:36:20,261 --> 01:36:23,521
their physiques the guys a big now.
But you look at the quality is not the 

2165
01:36:23,521 --> 01:36:23,521
same.
It's not the same.

2166
01:36:23,521 --> 01:36:27,370
Not the same.
Can you just generally accepted in 

2167
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:29,321
bodybuilding in the nineties was the 
peak of competitive physiques as far as 

2168
01:36:30,141 --> 01:36:31,820
the standard and the depth of the 
standard.

2169
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:36,740
There was like six to eight guys on that
stage that were like really,

2170
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,210
like if you are off,
you know,

2171
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:41,060
there's places could change.
Now you've got one guy,

2172
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:42,170
Phil,
Phil Heath,

2173
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:47,171
who was the Mr Olympia and it's pretty 
like distance between him and the next 

2174
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:48,050
few guys.

2175
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:53,590
Now what is it though that it doesn't 
open the door for a current modern day?

2176
01:36:54,471 --> 01:36:57,240
Dorian Yates,
like some super dedicated person.

2177
01:36:57,241 --> 01:36:59,500
Me physiologically,
people can still do the same things that

2178
01:36:59,501 --> 01:36:59,960
you did.

2179
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:01,780
Yeah.
But um,

2180
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:08,130
things have changed since the nineties.
There's a lot more avenues that people 

2181
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,630
could choose to go down.
I was like doing a sport or in,

2182
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:15,720
for instance,
UFC that doesn't exist in the early 

2183
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,110
nineties.
I remember watching the first show on a.

2184
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,570
It was in New York.
I watched on TV the first,

2185
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:19,570
the very first one,
you know,

2186
01:37:19,571 --> 01:37:20,080
with,
uh,

2187
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:22,210
always crazy.
So you've got,

2188
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:25,540
you've got mma,
you've got crossfit and it got all these

2189
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:29,740
other competitions now in the,
in the bodybuilding arena,

2190
01:37:29,741 --> 01:37:32,170
that's not bodybuilding.
It's men's physique,

2191
01:37:32,171 --> 01:37:35,050
whether we're the board shorts and they 
got the nice physique and abdominals,

2192
01:37:35,051 --> 01:37:37,720
that kind of physique that most people 
aspire to have.

2193
01:37:37,721 --> 01:37:39,100
I guess.
A,

2194
01:37:39,101 --> 01:37:44,101
you've got classic bodybuilding,
so got a lot of different avenues and I 

2195
01:37:44,101 --> 01:37:48,031
think the interest in pure bodybuilding 
is a lot less than I made in the 

2196
01:37:48,031 --> 01:37:49,540
nineties.
Everyone wanted to be a bodybuilder.

2197
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:51,430
It was like hugely popular.

2198
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:53,200
Yeah.
What's interesting now,

2199
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:54,640
what is this Jamie?
What do you pull it up here?

2200
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:56,370
This a Mr Olympia from

2201
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,640
996 is myself,
Sean Ray in the middle and that's one of

2202
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:03,690
Coleman on the end who became a an eight
time Mr Olympia

2203
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,780
guys are on Jack also.
It's so hard to tell them like,

2204
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,200
I'm looking at this.
I'm like,

2205
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:15,460
fuck,
I'll call the guy on the end is the 

2206
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:18,030
best.
Well,

2207
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:23,031
it's also got to be hard for that tiny 
dude that's next to you decided to do 

2208
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:28,730
it.
It's always been unhappy because it got 

2209
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:29,220
been by me,
but a thing as he had a great physique,

2210
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,110
just like frank.
Zane had a great physique,

2211
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,810
you know,
if he was the same size as arnold,

2212
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:39,530
maybe it would have beat him,
but he wasn't in the same size as 

2213
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:39,790
arnold.
And same goes with a gentleman up there.

2214
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,270
Mr Shawn Ray.
He had a great physique,

2215
01:38:42,271 --> 01:38:44,100
but you know,
I was twice as big.

2216
01:38:44,101 --> 01:38:47,130
So big guy always beats a good little 
guy,

2217
01:38:47,131 --> 01:38:48,420
right?
Yeah.

2218
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:53,010
It's a crazy sport man.
Now what about the top guys today?

2219
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:58,011
Like you said,
Sean Heath is the number one guy to 

2220
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:58,011
them.
Phil.

2221
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:58,011
Hey,
I'm sorry.

2222
01:38:58,011 --> 01:39:00,420
Now there's so many different avenues 
now and a lot of them,

2223
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:05,520
a lot of people are going towards like 
the Internet route because you can make 

2224
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,141
a lot of money as like a,
an internet like famous person for being

2225
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:13,200
a bodybuilder.
Then you selling things and selling.

2226
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:16,230
There he is.
Phil Heath pretty jacked.

2227
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:18,950
Yep.
Phil Heath is,

2228
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:21,900
you know,
is not very wide in the shoulders,

2229
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,010
a weak point,
but has got huge,

2230
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:31,050
um,
long muscle bellies on the most of his 

2231
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,710
body as his pecs are not great,
but the rest,

2232
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:33,170
you know,

2233
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:37,050
the rest is a,
it doesn't really have any weak points,

2234
01:39:37,051 --> 01:39:42,051
so that's why he's is ahead of everybody
else and you just think there's just 

2235
01:39:42,051 --> 01:39:43,310
less people doing it now.
There's less

2236
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:48,340
people go into to competitive 
bodybuilder because there's a lot more 

2237
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:51,071
avenues and I think it's less popular 
now because it's almost like peeked out 

2238
01:39:51,071 --> 01:39:53,120
with myself and run in and gone down a 
little bit.

2239
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:55,960
It's like,
how do you know,

2240
01:39:56,070 --> 01:40:01,070
how do you surpass it?
Got to a peak and guys are trying to do 

2241
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:02,180
that so that they,
you know,

2242
01:40:02,181 --> 01:40:04,310
that they're trying to get big and 
they're getting big,

2243
01:40:04,311 --> 01:40:06,470
but they're getting big with a big waste
and everything as well.

2244
01:40:06,471 --> 01:40:11,471
So it's not the same.
It's not the same look as not the same 

2245
01:40:11,471 --> 01:40:11,471
quality.

2246
01:40:11,471 --> 01:40:11,960
That's got to be super dangerous,
isn't it?

2247
01:40:11,961 --> 01:40:14,720
When you see those guys,
those are enormous bloated bellies.

2248
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:16,550
That's a huge debate.
And the like,

2249
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,380
what is that?
What is it?

2250
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:21,830
I don't know,
internal organs that are

2251
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,370
initially,
uh,

2252
01:40:24,371 --> 01:40:25,720
that's what people thought,
right?

2253
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:28,200
And um,
I,

2254
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:30,610
my wife started getting little bloated 
around 96,

2255
01:40:30,611 --> 01:40:35,611
97,
maybe [inaudible] 97 when I was using 

2256
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:35,611
insulin.
Right.

2257
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:36,820
You got a little bloated and load 
standard.

2258
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:42,260
Um,
but when I retired it went down and I 

2259
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:42,430
actually in England because I was always
like,

2260
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:47,450
oh,
I'm taking steroids for this sport 

2261
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:47,450
because I'm a professional when I'm not 
competing,

2262
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,220
I'm not going to take them.
So stop taking them.

2263
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:52,110
And also I took growth hormone and that 
was the thing.

2264
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:57,300
A lot of people think hormone is going 
to increase the size of internal organs 

2265
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,240
and that's why guys are getting bloated 
waistline.

2266
01:40:58,950 --> 01:41:00,820
Uh,
so I went and had a real,

2267
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:06,240
I mean a battery of tests where they 
actually measure all your internal 

2268
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:09,340
organs and mine all totally normal.
Apart from my heart was a bit bigger and

2269
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:11,490
stronger,
but that's just normal athletic hot.

2270
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,440
Uh,
so that wasn't the case.

2271
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:19,860
So I perhaps it's,
I'm a fat this building up around the 

2272
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:25,591
internal organs or maybe it's just a lot
of water in the intestines and it just 

2273
01:41:25,591 --> 01:41:29,380
blows to the waste out of the short 
answer is the short answer is I don't 

2274
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:31,450
really know who's that guy in the far 
left a.

2275
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,160
that's like a turtle shell.

2276
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:35,720
There's not really a turtle shell.
Yeah.

2277
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:38,870
Jesus Christ.
So that could be insulin.

2278
01:41:38,871 --> 01:41:39,290
That can be.

2279
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:45,820
We only seen this kind of thing 
happening since the guys are using 

2280
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:47,780
insulin and igf,
which is insulin like growth factor.

2281
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:49,430
Wow.
Um,

2282
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,270
so yeah,
it's not a good look.

2283
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:52,190
It's not a,
you know,

2284
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,590
a turtle show.
Look,

2285
01:41:54,591 --> 01:41:56,260
it's so weird.
It literally looks like.

2286
01:41:56,261 --> 01:41:59,580
So it's like the guys that got big but 
everywhere systemic,

2287
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:00,710
like growth,
you know,

2288
01:42:00,711 --> 01:42:02,260
when you're training with weights,
you know,

2289
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:07,280
your major muscles are going to grow but
not around the waist can thicken a 

2290
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:07,430
little bit but not that much.

2291
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:10,560
Now when you got off of everything,
when you retired,

2292
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,240
what was the crash like?

2293
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,680
Well,
it wasn't something I was ready for.

2294
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:18,330
I had a lot of things going in my life.
I had a divorce,

2295
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:23,900
I had a,
somebody close to me pass away and um,

2296
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,140
you know,
retiring,

2297
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:30,470
so you know,
they say a death in the family or 

2298
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:32,631
divorce or retirement is like a major 
stressful event or how about an old 

2299
01:42:32,631 --> 01:42:36,060
fucking three at the same time while 
you're not while you're coming down from

2300
01:42:36,061 --> 01:42:37,890
steroids.
So yeah,

2301
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:40,800
I definitely suffered from depression 
and anxiety.

2302
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,860
Like I don't know what's going on,
like why do I feel like this?

2303
01:42:43,861 --> 01:42:46,650
I didn't even like now I know,
right?

2304
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:51,740
Because you fucking stopped cold Turkey 
because I'm extreme unlike I'm using 

2305
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:56,091
them because I'm doing this.
I'm stopped now and stop and I had no 

2306
01:42:56,091 --> 01:43:00,231
real help.
There was no real like this guy is now 

2307
01:43:00,231 --> 01:43:00,260
and especially in the states that,
you know,

2308
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:04,710
they specialized in patients that are 
using steroids and all the possible side

2309
01:43:04,711 --> 01:43:06,450
effects and coming off and all that 
stuff.

2310
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:11,660
I didn't really have any of that.
So I just went cold Turkey and after 

2311
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:16,341
about two years my normal testosterone 
was still not coming into the normal.

2312
01:43:17,371 --> 01:43:19,440
So then I went on the replacement 
therapy,

2313
01:43:19,441 --> 01:43:22,920
which is like twice a month,
a testosterone replacement,

2314
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:25,170
and then I felt normal again.

2315
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,950
So the,
the come down like you,

2316
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:33,010
you're taking this work.
What were you taking like right before 

2317
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:33,010
he stopped,
like what was the,

2318
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:37,840
do you remember?
Probably about a thousand milligrams a 

2319
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:38,420
week total of testosterone,
a total of every.

2320
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:40,550
All kinds of stuff.
Deep on everything.

2321
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:43,960
But if testosterone but have a deck or 
something like that and then

2322
01:43:45,110 --> 01:43:46,880
then stop and then,
you know,

2323
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:50,970
was it a gradual effect where your 
body's freaking out or was it like

2324
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:53,270
almost instantaneous?
Um,

2325
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:58,530
it was probably after a few months I 
started like noticing I wasn't feeling 

2326
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:59,710
too good,
funnily enough,

2327
01:43:59,711 --> 01:44:04,711
like sex drive didn't totally disappear 
and actually had my daughter was 

2328
01:44:05,831 --> 01:44:10,831
conceived while I was not on anything.
So I think they did trials with 

2329
01:44:10,831 --> 01:44:15,151
testosterone as a male contraceptive and
it was moderately effective but not 

2330
01:44:15,161 --> 01:44:17,080
enough that they would market it.
So,

2331
01:44:17,650 --> 01:44:19,330
um,
yeah,

2332
01:44:19,331 --> 01:44:22,090
probably like six to nine months it was 
really not,

2333
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:25,120
not feeling good at all.
And you know,

2334
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:28,450
there's a lot of factors there.
If I was still taking steroids,

2335
01:44:28,451 --> 01:44:32,080
but those things happened in my life 
would have felt as bad,

2336
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:33,700
I don't know,
probably not,

2337
01:44:33,701 --> 01:44:38,701
but there were definitely a lot of 
traumatic stuff going on at the same 

2338
01:44:38,701 --> 01:44:38,701
time.

2339
01:44:38,701 --> 01:44:39,070
Now,
was there any conventional wisdom in the

2340
01:44:39,071 --> 01:44:44,071
bodybuilding community of how to slowly 
cycle off or what the factors would be 

2341
01:44:44,801 --> 01:44:46,750
and how you could mitigate them?

2342
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:49,210
Not at that time now.
Twenty years on.

2343
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:54,270
I mean,
you can go on the Internet and find a 

2344
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:54,270
ton of information,
but,

2345
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:57,290
but not really.
Then the only thing is guys were using 

2346
01:44:57,290 --> 01:45:00,091
was atg,
which is like helps to Cheryl and 

2347
01:45:00,091 --> 01:45:00,091
testosterone.
Clomid,

2348
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:03,480
clomid and some natural stuff like that.
Um,

2349
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:07,120
I remember going to an endocrinologist 
and asking him like,

2350
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,220
you know,
what she'll do is she'll do acg and this

2351
01:45:09,221 --> 01:45:10,000
and that,
and he's like,

2352
01:45:10,001 --> 01:45:10,750
look at me.
And he said,

2353
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:12,850
you know what,
Dorian,

2354
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:15,640
you probably know more than me about 
this.

2355
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:18,880
Thanks for that.
Now you know,

2356
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:21,370
he's talking about this situation and 
somebody coming off steroids,

2357
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:22,480
he didn't know.
He didn't have a clue,

2358
01:45:22,481 --> 01:45:22,900
man.
Right.

2359
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:26,200
It's a different thing,
but now you've got guys out there,

2360
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:31,201
they'd have a whole.
I did a seminar and I'm in Canada and 

2361
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:37,110
Ben Johnson was there,
actually the guy that Olympic gold 

2362
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:39,571
medalist for awhile,
he was there with his doctor and has a 

2363
01:45:39,571 --> 01:45:43,401
couple of other doctors there and one of
the doctors told me that absolutely 

2364
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:47,260
every guy that was in the hundred meters
race tested positive every guy.

2365
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,920
Um,
but I think it was CBS was covering the 

2366
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:52,920
contest and they're like,
we can't fucking,

2367
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,790
you know,
kind of have every guy like,

2368
01:45:55,090 --> 01:46:00,090
yeah,
you've got to choose one and make sure 

2369
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:00,090
he's not American.
Really.

2370
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:01,540
That's the story they told me and I 
believe that man,

2371
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:06,790
there's definitely some real good 
evidence that they're all doing 

2372
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:06,790
something

2373
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:08,610
goat.
I felt felt bad for him and he was like,

2374
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:10,950
fucking demonized.
I remember all the newspapers.

2375
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:15,300
I remember my son went to school and 
they did a whole thing at school about,

2376
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,640
you know,
and it came home.

2377
01:46:17,641 --> 01:46:19,500
He must have fucking known.
His Dad was jacked up.

2378
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:21,980
Like,
like,

2379
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:27,130
uh,
the guy was cheating and you shouldn't 

2380
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:27,130
do that and all this stuff.
They told him at school and I was like,

2381
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:32,960
alright,
so not explained to you when you have 

2382
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:32,960
it,

2383
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,770
and he also had no recourse like Lance 
Armstrong today as a podcast.

2384
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:37,990
He's done a bunch of interviews.
He can tell his story and now you know,

2385
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:41,750
I mean I think there was a period of 
time where lance was demonized,

2386
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:47,080
but over time that is greatly subsided 
and people now recognize,

2387
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:52,601
no,
he literally was in a sport where 

2388
01:46:52,601 --> 01:46:53,400
everyone was cheating.
But is that cheating?

2389
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:55,380
Well,
if everyone's doing it,

2390
01:46:55,381 --> 01:47:00,381
is it cheaper?
Then the real issue I think was 

2391
01:47:00,381 --> 01:47:02,220
deception and lawsuits and saying that 
he didn't do it in suing people who said

2392
01:47:02,221 --> 01:47:06,180
he did and there was a lot of stuff that
wasn't exactly the smartest thing to do,

2393
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:11,480
but you're dealing with a cornered 
person who's a super competitive alpha 

2394
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,570
male trying to figure his way out of 
this mess that he's found himself in and

2395
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:20,250
this mass that exists systematically or 
systemically in this entire industry.

2396
01:47:20,251 --> 01:47:21,690
The entire sport that he's involved.

2397
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:23,680
Yeah,
I remember the um,

2398
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:28,960
there was a car that got stopped in the 
board or a few years ago and the Tour de

2399
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:29,680
France is going,
you know,

2400
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:31,840
France to someone across the border 
anyway,

2401
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:34,530
and it was a team call,
right.

2402
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:39,540
And they stopped the team car and it was
just full of apo and steroids and all 

2403
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:39,540
this stuff,
you know.

2404
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:42,220
So it's how well,
uh,

2405
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:44,380
when was the first Tour de France?
I don't know,

2406
01:47:44,381 --> 01:47:47,110
but I know environment,
one of the very early ones,

2407
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:49,340
uh,
the,

2408
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:54,510
the guy that was winning,
he died because it was using 

2409
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:54,510
amphetamines let back in whatever,
I don't know,

2410
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:54,760
19,
10,

2411
01:47:54,761 --> 01:47:56,530
19,
20 or something like that.

2412
01:47:56,531 --> 01:47:58,020
So,
um,

2413
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:00,700
it's there,
it's part of the sport.

2414
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:05,740
When I came into bodybuilding,
it's not like I invented steroids with 

2415
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:05,740
already there,
you know,

2416
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:10,410
my first Mister Olympia is in 1965.
Larry Scott was the Mr Olympia and 90 

2417
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:10,690
65.

2418
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,600
And he said he was using steroids and 
that was 1965.

2419
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:16,120
So when did this start being used?
I don't know,

2420
01:48:16,121 --> 01:48:19,390
but for sure in the early sixties,
1965,

2421
01:48:19,391 --> 01:48:21,310
they had steroids.
When did they invent steroids?

2422
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,990
Uh,
I believe,

2423
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,550
well,
you had testosterone.

2424
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:27,460
Testosterone was used in the Second 
World War.

2425
01:48:27,461 --> 01:48:30,670
The Germans were using that with the SS 
soldiers.

2426
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:34,750
Um,
so injectable testosterone was available

2427
01:48:34,751 --> 01:48:39,751
then steroids,
which are more refined version of 

2428
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:39,751
testosterone.
Um,

2429
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:43,000
I think late fifties.
How is it more refined in what way?

2430
01:48:43,570 --> 01:48:45,520
So you got testosterone is a male 
hormone,

2431
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,760
so it's basically 50 percent androgenic 
that's male,

2432
01:48:48,761 --> 01:48:52,780
like characteristics,
50 percent anabolic repair build.

2433
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:58,650
So they want it to take this and they 
want to this pot the anabolic and 

2434
01:48:58,871 --> 01:49:02,050
minimize the androgenic because that's 
what gives you side effects,

2435
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:05,890
prostate growth and all that stuff.
So they try,

2436
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,920
they refined it so that those effects 
are minimized and more of the anabolic 

2437
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:10,920
effect.

2438
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:15,570
That was the idea.
And as a guy called John Stigler I 

2439
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:19,171
think,
and because they found out the eastern 

2440
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:22,921
bloc,
they had their own at their own stuff 

2441
01:49:22,921 --> 01:49:23,830
called to rentable.
So a siegler invented,

2442
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:25,810
definable,
and I don't know,

2443
01:49:25,811 --> 01:49:29,110
don't quote me if I could be wrong,
but I think it was about 58 or something

2444
01:49:29,111 --> 01:49:30,460
like that.
He developed that for us.

2445
01:49:30,461 --> 01:49:33,040
Weightlifting team,
1958,

2446
01:49:33,041 --> 01:49:35,560
I think it was 58 years,
but before that you had testosterone,

2447
01:49:35,561 --> 01:49:39,040
so who knows what a.
When people started using it,

2448
01:49:39,041 --> 01:49:44,041
but for sure from the early sixties it's
been a part of bodybuilding and then 

2449
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:48,900
other sports and they used to be a 
disclaimer inside the steroid thing 

2450
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:53,680
saying anabolic steroids do not increase
athletic performance.

2451
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,880
That's hilarious.
Right?

2452
01:49:54,910 --> 01:49:57,970
So they stated this and they also told 
guys if you take this,

2453
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:00,040
your fucking balls are going to drop 
off,

2454
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,120
you're going to fucking die.

2455
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:06,390
You're going to get liver cancer.
So guys started using them and seeing 

2456
01:50:06,581 --> 01:50:07,900
that that's all bullshit,
right?

2457
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:10,320
So then they don't want to listen to 
anything.

2458
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:12,760
These medical guys you've got to say 
because you're aligned to us then.

2459
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:15,430
So you're going to be lying to us all 
the time.

2460
01:50:15,431 --> 01:50:16,450
Not necessarily.
So.

2461
01:50:16,451 --> 01:50:21,451
Yeah,
because you do have chances of side 

2462
01:50:21,451 --> 01:50:23,701
effects,
but if you could say it's been greatly 

2463
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:25,810
exaggerated and certain propaganda and 
deception,

2464
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:26,290
right?
Yeah.

2465
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:28,390
Just tell the fucking truth,
man,

2466
01:50:28,391 --> 01:50:30,080
and let them deal with it.
And uh,

2467
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:35,400
that's what I do because I saw all this 
stuff on the Internet about what I'm 

2468
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:40,350
supposedly doing and I thought young 
guys are going to read this and maybe 

2469
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:41,740
they're going to do it.
So I did an article in a magazine,

2470
01:50:41,741 --> 01:50:43,060
muscular development and I said,
here,

2471
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:46,110
this is what I did,
this is what I did in officer,

2472
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:50,100
this is what a different context and 
these are my opinions and you know,

2473
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:55,560
my honest opinion is like,
I don't think it's worth it unless you 

2474
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:55,560
know,
you're competing and so on.

2475
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:58,020
But ultimately it's up to you.
Let me give you the information.

2476
01:50:58,030 --> 01:51:03,030
What you do is up to you.
And I don't know if 70 percent of the 

2477
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:03,610
people like this is bullshit.
He didn't really,

2478
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:06,160
you must have talked much more than this
because I'm taking this.

2479
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:08,260
Actually I'm taking more than this and I
will look like,

2480
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:10,360
oh,
tough shit man.

2481
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:15,510
You know,
I know a lot of guys that take more 

2482
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:19,141
stuff than me.
Then I couldn't even compete in a 

2483
01:51:19,141 --> 01:51:19,141
contest.
I'm not even good enough.

2484
01:51:19,141 --> 01:51:20,710
Is there a certain amount where it 
doesn't help you?

2485
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:23,830
I think it gets to like,
the cup is full,

2486
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:24,640
right?
You know,

2487
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:28,240
it's just a matter of hard work is the 
cup is fallen more than that.

2488
01:51:28,241 --> 01:51:31,660
Isn't that going to help you anymore?
It's just going to increase your chances

2489
01:51:31,661 --> 01:51:34,010
of negative effects.
Um,

2490
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,430
so when I was an amateur,
it might,

2491
01:51:36,490 --> 01:51:41,490
my policy was always take as little as 
possible to get the maximum effect and 

2492
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:43,690
when that's not working then you can go 
up a little bit more,

2493
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:44,100
you know?

2494
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:49,520
Um,
but if you go a day one and just 

2495
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:49,990
throwing everything in,
the body's going to get used to that way

2496
01:51:49,991 --> 01:51:51,970
you're going to go,
where would you get steroids?

2497
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:53,350
Uh,
where,

2498
01:51:53,351 --> 01:51:57,460
where did I used to get them?
I mean when I got them in in UK was just

2499
01:51:57,461 --> 01:52:02,461
from the gym when I first started.
I mean people were bringing them in,

2500
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,840
trucks loads full from Europe and there 
was not,

2501
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:07,900
you know,
the authorities are not even aware of it

2502
01:52:07,901 --> 01:52:11,350
or concerned about it or anything.
Now the policy,

2503
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:16,530
at least in a UK,
and it depends on every country in 

2504
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:20,761
Europe,
but in uk it's perfectly legal to have 

2505
01:52:20,761 --> 01:52:22,750
steroids for your own use,
so you going to be driving your car with

2506
01:52:22,751 --> 01:52:27,751
a bunch of steroids on the fucking 
passenger seat and the police call you 

2507
01:52:27,751 --> 01:52:27,751
and you're like,
what's this?

2508
01:52:27,751 --> 01:52:28,270
Isn't my steroids?
Okay.

2509
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:34,110
For Your own personal use is selling,
making money and not paying your taxes.

2510
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:36,670
That's all they care about.
No.

2511
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,140
Well,
that's I think how it should be.

2512
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,730
You know,
as long as his education,

2513
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:44,731
as long as you're not lying,
but the problem is when you lie to 

2514
01:52:44,731 --> 01:52:47,521
people about the effects of things,
then they think you lied to them about 

2515
01:52:47,521 --> 01:52:47,521
pain pills.

2516
01:52:47,521 --> 01:52:48,800
You're find about all sorts of other 
stuff that is actually deadly.

2517
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:53,980
I think all fucking drugs should be 
legal and it should put money into 

2518
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:58,751
education and treatment and that's what 
they did in Portugal and the fucking 

2519
01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:00,560
results.
Write down,

2520
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:03,570
Glenn Greenwald actually post something 
today about that.

2521
01:53:03,571 --> 01:53:08,571
Showing how it's changed over time and 
gotten actually better since they have 

2522
01:53:08,761 --> 01:53:11,250
made,
especially in particular marijuana since

2523
01:53:11,251 --> 01:53:16,251
they've made marijuana.
Legal and started legalizing drugs and 

2524
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:20,250
in Portugal they've had far less 
incidences of people having like real 

2525
01:53:20,461 --> 01:53:20,950
issues,

2526
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:26,070
so literally and the money they use it 
to reeducate people and get them out of 

2527
01:53:26,651 --> 01:53:28,770
that cycle and try and get them back 
into society to,

2528
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:33,840
to get them a job and all that stuff is 
just going to punish people for doing 

2529
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,291
it.
How the fuck they ever going to get 

2530
01:53:37,291 --> 01:53:37,291
better?
Yeah.

2531
01:53:37,291 --> 01:53:38,180
Well there's also a problem with telling
people not to do something and they want

2532
01:53:38,181 --> 01:53:38,670
to do it.

2533
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,130
Especially when you're young.
This is a label.

2534
01:53:42,131 --> 01:53:43,090
Oh yeah.
Let me do it.

2535
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:45,850
Here it is.
You can fucking have it if you want,

2536
01:53:45,851 --> 01:53:48,700
but this is all the negative 
consequences.

2537
01:53:48,701 --> 01:53:51,790
And what do you want to do now?
People are choosing

2538
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,290
to do it.
The bodybuilders.

2539
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:55,110
Bodybuilders that died.
Um,

2540
01:53:55,480 --> 01:54:00,480
did any of them die from steroids or did
they die from complications involving a 

2541
01:54:01,031 --> 01:54:02,200
host of different issues?

2542
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,960
Well,
that's hard to say because there's been 

2543
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:11,331
quite a few of bodybuilders and mainly 
male and mainly the bigger guys.

2544
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,970
Well that has been a couple of women 
that have died from heart attacks.

2545
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:18,930
So did steroids contribute to that?
Possibly.

2546
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:20,230
What,
what,

2547
01:54:20,231 --> 01:54:21,330
uh,
what else were they doing?

2548
01:54:21,331 --> 01:54:22,530
You know,
the individual cases,

2549
01:54:22,531 --> 01:54:27,531
who knows with taking pain pills,
a antiinflammatories or they're doing 

2550
01:54:28,831 --> 01:54:31,120
recreational drugs.
There's a lot of,

2551
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,460
a lot of factors there.
Um,

2552
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,840
but I think would be probably fair to 
say that using steroids over a longterm 

2553
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:42,960
will probably increase your risk of 
heart disease perhaps.

2554
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:46,530
I think it causes some inflammation in 
the lining of the arteries.

2555
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:49,410
Can raise the blood pressure a little 
bit and so on.

2556
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:51,730
So yeah,
I,

2557
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:52,500
I,
uh,

2558
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,650
I compare it to smoking,
you know,

2559
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:57,210
probably not as bad though.
Yeah.

2560
01:54:57,260 --> 01:55:00,330
So the way I look at it as I smoked for 
10 years and then I stopped.

2561
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:01,310
So now

2562
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:06,020
quit stuff.
And now speaking of smoking good stuff.

2563
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,950
How did you get,
how did you find out about DMT and how'd

2564
01:55:09,951 --> 01:55:14,951
you get involved?
Because I read something about you 

2565
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:15,950
having these positive dmt experiences.
Wow.

2566
01:55:15,951 --> 01:55:18,720
How strange is it reading about,
you know,

2567
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:23,980
massive bodybuilder now getting into 
psychedelic drugs while I'm speaking 

2568
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:25,150
openly about that first time

2569
01:55:25,570 --> 01:55:27,070
did I asked her,
was on in Brazil.

2570
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:28,930
I met,
my wife was outside,

2571
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:32,140
she lived in Brazil,
so we went out to the Amazon and the,

2572
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:35,650
well this was like 10 years ago,
you know,

2573
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:39,580
so people weren't really not like now 
people know what I'll ask her is because

2574
01:55:39,581 --> 01:55:43,500
so much information out there yourself 
talking about I'm talking about is a ton

2575
01:55:43,501 --> 01:55:45,480
of stuff on the Internet.
Um,

2576
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:50,570
it wasn't so much then,
but I heard about it and I heard about 

2577
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:53,301
this.
It's a life changing experience and all 

2578
01:55:53,301 --> 01:55:55,371
that stuff.
So we were out in Brazil and we've got 

2579
01:55:55,371 --> 01:55:56,250
this guide and ask him for Ios Oscar and
he's like,

2580
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:02,630
bring me these two balls of brown stuff.
I don't even know to this day if it was 

2581
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:05,580
really Alaska,
but I just got really sick and didn't 

2582
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,560
see any great revelations apart from 
I've got this thing in my head.

2583
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,560
Stop poisoning yourself.
Well the night before I'd been out 

2584
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:12,560
drinking,
getting drunk and everything.

2585
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:15,570
So you know,
that was my experience with that.

2586
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:20,130
Then a friend of mine out out here in 
California actually I knew about dmt.

2587
01:56:20,131 --> 01:56:23,130
I used to live in Amsterdam and I read 
the DMT,

2588
01:56:23,131 --> 01:56:25,290
the spirit molecule and all that stuff.
So I knew about it,

2589
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:28,830
but I had no idea get the stuff away you
can get it from and everything.

2590
01:56:29,370 --> 01:56:31,560
So a friend of mine got it.
And uh,

2591
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:37,250
that was my first experience of like 
leaving the room,

2592
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:39,630
so to speak,
and the planet.

2593
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:45,360
And then since then I had to some very 
positive ios grew experiences,

2594
01:56:45,361 --> 01:56:49,990
but with a shaman and doing properly and
prepare in like five days of know,

2595
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:55,250
restricted diet and no sex and all these
kinds of things you do to prepare and 

2596
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:56,980
also afterwards,
um,

2597
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:02,600
so dmt is like blow the fucking doors of
your perception and realize that this 

2598
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,590
world we're in is like,
you know,

2599
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:06,360
it's nothing,
it's just a little illusion,

2600
01:57:06,361 --> 01:57:06,570
right.

2601
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:09,330
There's so much more outside of it.
Um,

2602
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:11,760
so there was that.
But with the DMT,

2603
01:57:11,761 --> 01:57:16,761
I think it's like you've got a computer 
with like so much storage space and 

2604
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:21,270
you've got,
it's like a thousand times more than you

2605
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:26,271
can retain.
So you see all this stuff and while 

2606
01:57:26,271 --> 01:57:26,271
you're there you're like,
I know everything.

2607
01:57:26,271 --> 01:57:28,050
Oh yes,
but when you come back,

2608
01:57:28,051 --> 01:57:30,540
how much of it can you hold onto,
you know,

2609
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,540
uh,
so you've sent it and that's like,

2610
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:34,230
makes you look at everything 
differently.

2611
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:39,650
What the Ios is over hours.
So I feel like from the Ios I actually 

2612
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:44,031
benefited more,
it was like going through therapy or 

2613
01:57:44,031 --> 01:57:44,430
something because it was much slower and
I couldn't digest it,

2614
01:57:44,431 --> 01:57:46,010
you know,
so um,

2615
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:48,510
but doing it with the Shaman,
uh,

2616
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:52,520
I did it with a guy called Gmo,
other Railo and his,

2617
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:57,530
one of the top guys in the world from 
Peru comes to Spain a couple of times a 

2618
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:57,530
year.

2619
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:59,010
So I did it with him and um,
yeah,

2620
01:57:59,011 --> 01:58:00,420
it's probably,
I don't know,

2621
01:58:00,421 --> 01:58:04,680
it's probably two or three years since I
did dmt because I sat down one day and I

2622
01:58:04,681 --> 01:58:07,440
said,
actually I fasted for three days before,

2623
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,420
so I'll be like,
just in the zone.

2624
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:10,950
And I said,
right,

2625
01:58:10,951 --> 01:58:12,990
I'm going to sit down.
I got my dmt here,

2626
01:58:12,991 --> 01:58:17,991
I've got my vaporizer here.
I'm going to fucking smoke as much DMT 

2627
01:58:17,991 --> 01:58:18,720
as I possibly can to like,
like,

2628
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:21,840
you know,
to like gone and pass out.

2629
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:27,290
So I had that experience and since then 
I just don't feel any need to do it.

2630
01:58:27,591 --> 01:58:29,190
I don't think there's anything more I 
can take from it.

2631
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,780
I've had many people tell me the same 
thing.

2632
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:35,230
They had such a profound breakthrough 
experience that they're like,

2633
01:58:35,231 --> 01:58:35,950
okay,
I get it.

2634
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:39,550
Yeah.
I had a crazy one in around 2000,

2635
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:40,930
I want to say like two,

2636
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:45,340
eight or nine or some point that.
And I took a long time off.

2637
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:48,160
I didn't do it again till like five 
years later maybe.

2638
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:50,200
It was pretty intense man.
I mean the,

2639
01:58:50,201 --> 01:58:54,610
the Ios was nice because it comes in 
Nice and subtle and you go through hours

2640
01:58:54,611 --> 01:58:56,570
of this thing.
But DMT is like,

2641
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:59,550
last time I did feel very anxious when 
you'd like,

2642
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:03,020
like it's almost like you're leaving 
your body and you know,

2643
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:07,080
so you get that bit of anxiety,
but once you go,

2644
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:09,190
oh yeah,
that's cool.

2645
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:11,500
But if you've done it more than one time
in a day,

2646
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:13,580
like multiple times in a night.
No,

2647
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:15,370
I just,
you know,

2648
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,560
just blasted it as far as it could go.
And that was it.

2649
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:21,810
I've done it several times over the 
course of a few hours and uh,

2650
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:24,760
you know,
you are more comfortable letting go that

2651
01:59:24,761 --> 01:59:27,910
way and some sort of a strange way,
but it never gets less alien.

2652
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:29,540
Oh,
he had a,

2653
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,250
I'm not gonna mention his name,
I don't know his name,

2654
01:59:31,251 --> 01:59:34,670
but we had an experience,
me and my friend a few months ago,

2655
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:36,240
um,
uh,

2656
01:59:36,290 --> 01:59:38,780
that I'd never seen before because 
usually people take dmt,

2657
01:59:38,781 --> 01:59:43,781
they very calm and sit in the chair and 
you'd go off and you might start 

2658
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:43,890
laughing,
but you know,

2659
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:44,960
you don't move much.
Right.

2660
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:47,900
And this guy,
he just like freaked out,

2661
01:59:47,910 --> 01:59:51,260
like it wasn't for 10 minutes or half an
hour on.

2662
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:55,920
My friend was a former MMA fights used 
to fight with shamrock.

2663
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:57,920
So we're hitting in a wrestling 
techniques.

2664
01:59:57,921 --> 02:00:00,800
So we had to hold this guy on the floor 
to stop him from hurting himself because

2665
02:00:00,801 --> 02:00:03,440
it was totally freaking out.
So I could see the guy was going through

2666
02:00:03,441 --> 02:00:06,380
some,
something traumatic from the past.

2667
02:00:06,381 --> 02:00:08,480
So today I messaged them,
I say,

2668
02:00:08,481 --> 02:00:10,070
hey,
did you ever find out what the guy,

2669
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:10,640
what,
what,

2670
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:11,750
what was that?
You know,

2671
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:13,550
because it was,
he said,

2672
02:00:13,551 --> 02:00:15,320
yeah,
it was from his birth.

2673
02:00:15,990 --> 02:00:18,000
What's his,
from his birth when he was born,

2674
02:00:18,001 --> 02:00:20,050
he had the cord around his neck.
Oh Geez.

2675
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:25,430
And then he went back and relive this 
and so that had been in the back of his 

2676
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:26,850
mind all his life,
subconscious,

2677
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:30,900
subconscious as a huge effect on us,
but we don't know it's there.

2678
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:34,020
So now he opened that box and let it out
and that's gone now,

2679
02:00:34,021 --> 02:00:34,070
you

2680
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:37,080
know,
so it can be therapeutic.

2681
02:00:37,081 --> 02:00:39,070
A,
I thought this guy's like,

2682
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,760
oh,
he's going to be.

2683
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:41,820
But when it came back,
it was like,

2684
02:00:41,821 --> 02:00:43,000
Hey,
I'm like,

2685
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:44,220
you're good.
He's like,

2686
02:00:44,221 --> 02:00:44,730
yeah,
I'm good.

2687
02:00:44,731 --> 02:00:46,530
I'm like,
do you know what just happened?

2688
02:00:46,531 --> 02:00:47,100
He's like,
no.

2689
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:47,730
I said,
good thing.

2690
02:00:47,731 --> 02:00:49,620
We filmed at them and go home and watch 
this.

2691
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:53,040
I had a friend of freaked out too.
He freaked out.

2692
02:00:53,070 --> 02:00:55,260
He threw up,
took his shirt off.

2693
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:57,420
I was running around saying a bunch of 
crazy shit.

2694
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:58,500
And then,
uh,

2695
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,760
after he came down,
you know,

2696
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:01,860
we calmed him down and took like 10,
15 minutes.

2697
02:01:01,861 --> 02:01:03,500
He goes,
okay,

2698
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:08,510
well obviously I'm a work in progress,
but never forget that,

2699
02:01:09,990 --> 02:01:13,320
but did he know what it was that was 
troubling him so much?

2700
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:15,660
Well,
he had a bad childhood for sure.

2701
02:01:15,661 --> 02:01:18,010
Everything is like most of our shit is 
from that,

2702
02:01:18,011 --> 02:01:20,490
right from the developing years?
No,

2703
02:01:20,491 --> 02:01:21,240
for sure.
Yeah.

2704
02:01:21,241 --> 02:01:24,750
I mean in especially like real traumatic
ones,

2705
02:01:24,751 --> 02:01:29,751
abuse being beaten by his Stepdad and 
the punches fucked up shit that was just

2706
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:32,490
haunting him,
but he,

2707
02:01:32,491 --> 02:01:34,290
you know,
helps you to come to terms with that.

2708
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:38,570
Especially the Ios because it's longer.
I felt like the first time I did Iowaska

2709
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:40,070
properly with Shaman,
I felt like

2710
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:44,120
I was a different person.
The next day I felt it was done 20 years

2711
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:49,121
of fucking therapy or something and just
a lot of stuff I'd worked out in my 

2712
02:01:49,121 --> 02:01:49,760
mind.
I could even see other people's point of

2713
02:01:49,761 --> 02:01:52,540
view on things and that I couldn't see 
before.

2714
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:53,890
That's huge.
Right.

2715
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:58,920
Seeing other people's point of view,
especially a guy like you who's so 

2716
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:02,371
determined and goal oriented and just 
cut out all the bullshit and get it 

2717
02:02:02,371 --> 02:02:02,371
done.

2718
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:07,430
Yeah.
It can be a little insensitive to other 

2719
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:07,430
people's feelings around it because it's
just like

2720
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:11,910
nothing keep up my way.
That's a male thing in particular.

2721
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:12,800
Right.
And then,

2722
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:18,060
and it's like,
and bodybuilding and intensity and 

2723
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:22,341
competition and then being the best,
arguably the best ever and just fucking 

2724
02:02:22,650 --> 02:02:23,970
finding every day.

2725
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:30,330
A couple of weeks ago it was like that.
You don't see yourself as other people 

2726
02:02:30,330 --> 02:02:30,330
see you.
So what do you mean?

2727
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,550
He said like,
I remember when I was a kid,

2728
02:02:34,150 --> 02:02:35,700
first of all the size,
you know,

2729
02:02:35,790 --> 02:02:38,220
it was fucking huge,
but it's your persona.

2730
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:41,430
You might've said to me something very 
like normal,

2731
02:02:41,431 --> 02:02:42,510
like a,
you know,

2732
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:44,780
you know,
whatever.

2733
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:45,960
What are you doing with a dog?
Like,

2734
02:02:45,961 --> 02:02:47,190
just something normal.
I said,

2735
02:02:47,191 --> 02:02:47,820
no,
I'll be like,

2736
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:53,930
because just your,
your presence made me feel like the 

2737
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:53,930
inner

2738
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:58,500
right.
That's got to be weird when you're a 

2739
02:02:58,500 --> 02:02:58,500
little tiny kid and your dad's a 
gorilla.

2740
02:02:58,500 --> 02:02:58,500
Yeah,
I remember he did a

2741
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:00,760
it.
It's a kickbox and right.

2742
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:04,690
So he got his black belt when I was 
about 11 or something like that and that

2743
02:03:04,691 --> 02:03:09,691
was my thing.
I used to take into kickboxing and pick 

2744
02:03:09,691 --> 02:03:09,691
him up and he's like,
Dad,

2745
02:03:09,691 --> 02:03:11,170
can you just,
can you wait outside?

2746
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:16,600
I'm like,
what do you mean you want me to come in 

2747
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:16,600
and like,

2748
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:16,600
just wait outside,
like,

2749
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:17,080
you don't want to come.
It's like,

2750
02:03:17,081 --> 02:03:22,081
yeah,
but everyone's like freaking out and 

2751
02:03:22,081 --> 02:03:23,941
looking at you and it's got to be nice 
to have like know I'm fucking coming 

2752
02:03:24,521 --> 02:03:27,580
inside man.
Semi anonymous and crowds now.

2753
02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:28,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

2754
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,720
Unless someone's a hardcore bodybuilding
fan.

2755
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:33,160
Well that's the thing,
uh,

2756
02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:38,330
not necessarily slow because uh,
because of the interviews I did on 

2757
02:03:38,330 --> 02:03:39,450
London Real,
um,

2758
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:45,260
and I've talked about ios gear and dmt 
and spirituality and reality and all 

2759
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:49,221
this stuff.
I get so many people coming up to me 

2760
02:03:49,221 --> 02:03:51,180
like they're not from the gym.
I get housewives that young kids.

2761
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:54,450
Like it's almost like you're the guy 
from London Real,

2762
02:03:54,451 --> 02:03:55,870
you're the guy that,
you know.

2763
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:00,880
So I got a whole bunch of other people 
that appreciate what I'm saying about 

2764
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:03,540
spirituality about reality and life.
And they're like,

2765
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:04,560
fuck man,
what'd you said?

2766
02:04:04,561 --> 02:04:07,970
That really helped me and I got so many 
letters and emails and stuff,

2767
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:08,820
people,
you know,

2768
02:04:08,821 --> 02:04:11,910
like they just took something away from 
what I was saying.

2769
02:04:11,911 --> 02:04:15,390
So I mean that's,
that's really why I do these interviews.

2770
02:04:15,391 --> 02:04:18,690
It's just trying to help the whole 
general vibe and the,

2771
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:21,340
you know,
put it out there and um,

2772
02:04:21,390 --> 02:04:26,390
there's a whole consciousness awakening 
revolution going on now and I'm just 

2773
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:28,440
want to push some dominoes,
you know,

2774
02:04:28,930 --> 02:04:31,140
like create that effect.
And then,

2775
02:04:31,141 --> 02:04:32,640
you know,
if you touch one person,

2776
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:38,270
they touch somebody else and it's like 
the butterfly wings flap here and the 

2777
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:38,270
other side of the as a,
you know.

2778
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:39,860
Yeah.
It really or something.

2779
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:42,430
It does seem to be working in that,
in that regard,

2780
02:04:42,431 --> 02:04:42,590
right?

2781
02:04:42,970 --> 02:04:44,110
It is,
it is the time,

2782
02:04:44,111 --> 02:04:46,790
man.
It's the time is so many people that are

2783
02:04:46,791 --> 02:04:50,050
more aware now than like 20 years ago,

2784
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:51,080
isn't it?
Kind of like,

2785
02:04:51,081 --> 02:04:52,650
I mean,
there's parallels to bodybuilding,

2786
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:53,310
right?
It net.

2787
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:58,580
When Arnold first started doing it,
there was very little information for 

2788
02:04:58,580 --> 02:05:02,781
Harley and you guys got to see what they
did and build upon that and more 

2789
02:05:02,781 --> 02:05:04,560
information came out and now because of 
the Internet,

2790
02:05:04,561 --> 02:05:06,890
there's so much information,
too much information.

2791
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:09,570
People are aware more of what it's all 
about.

2792
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,520
Well,
with Psychedelics,

2793
02:05:11,521 --> 02:05:13,080
I mean 20,
30 years ago,

2794
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:18,090
there's so much ignorance and so little 
understanding of and also so little 

2795
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:20,160
understanding,
especially when it comes to something as

2796
02:05:20,161 --> 02:05:25,161
extreme as dmt.
There's still a giant percentage of our 

2797
02:05:25,161 --> 02:05:25,161
population doesn't even know what it is.

2798
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:27,710
Yeah.
They should all take it.

2799
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:31,520
Especially the fucking politicians.
I'd like to get those politicians,

2800
02:05:31,550 --> 02:05:33,780
man,
I'm fucking get them in a room and force

2801
02:05:33,781 --> 02:05:37,850
them to take dmt and then see how 
they're going to behave afterwards,

2802
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:43,120
how they're going to look at the world 
and treat people after they've had that 

2803
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:43,120
experience.
I don't.

2804
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:46,400
I don't think it can be a,
you know,

2805
02:05:46,401 --> 02:05:50,390
so self centered and unfeeling as most 
of them are.

2806
02:05:50,630 --> 02:05:51,980
After you've had that experience.

2807
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:54,850
I think that any breakthrough 
psychedelic experience,

2808
02:05:54,851 --> 02:05:58,130
whether it's silicide been or LSD or 
DMT,

2809
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,120
they all pretty much,
you know,

2810
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:03,030
ego dissolving roads to the same place.

2811
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:06,800
Terence Mckenna used to say that DMT is 
the center of the Mandala.

2812
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:12,100
The way I describe DMT is it's like 
mushrooms times a million plus amens and

2813
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:17,520
then it just seemed so titanic.
Lee Bizarre that there's like,

2814
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:20,180
I've tried to describe it to people,
but I always say,

2815
02:06:20,210 --> 02:06:21,730
look,
I'm going to tell them what to do it.

2816
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:23,350
I'm going to give you some bullshit

2817
02:06:23,470 --> 02:06:26,680
or because you can't.
It's no,

2818
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:30,040
we don't have the words to put it into 
words,

2819
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:31,200
you know,
you can attempt to.

2820
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:35,530
I went to this place was not a place,
but I don't have the word for it.

2821
02:06:35,560 --> 02:06:39,250
The places everywhere is like.
And there's colors,

2822
02:06:39,251 --> 02:06:44,251
there's numbers,
the shapes and people think things and 

2823
02:06:44,251 --> 02:06:44,950
this is like everything is all one 
fucking thing.

2824
02:06:44,951 --> 02:06:49,570
And what I noticed is like my breath was
connected to it.

2825
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:54,600
I don't know how it happened,
but I was in the trip and I went like 

2826
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:54,820
that.
And the whole thing moved.

2827
02:06:55,110 --> 02:07:00,110
I really let me try this then and then 
the whole thing moved and then there was

2828
02:07:00,491 --> 02:07:04,330
music playing and the music was part of 
the thing as well.

2829
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:06,370
Like the thing,
I don't even know what to call it,

2830
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,560
the thing that place,
I don't have a word,

2831
02:07:08,561 --> 02:07:08,800
you know,

2832
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:14,160
we played a bunch of these shaman and 
the Shaman who grids is the last time I 

2833
02:07:15,611 --> 02:07:20,611
did it and the Shaman [inaudible] like 
literally made the DMT images dance like

2834
02:07:21,070 --> 02:07:26,070
they had figured out a way with these 
sounds and songs to integrate these 

2835
02:07:27,131 --> 02:07:30,910
beats into dmt trips.
And as you would take these trips,

2836
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:36,130
these shamans had figured out the right 
sounds and songs how to make

2837
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,940
the trip more intense and sort of guided
in a strange way.

2838
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:42,370
What I had with um,
with a shaman,

2839
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:47,371
with the Ios guy.
He comes around and sings these arrows 

2840
02:07:47,371 --> 02:07:51,460
and like changes tone and then it goes 
deeper base in his chest and it's like,

2841
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:54,760
it's,
it becomes part of it,

2842
02:07:54,761 --> 02:07:58,330
you know.
And I was even moving in voluntarily.

2843
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:02,260
I was my arms going up,
my body was moving and it's like I'm not

2844
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:07,261
doing this.
I don't know even know how it's 

2845
02:08:07,261 --> 02:08:07,261
happening.
It's like somebody picking my arms up in

2846
02:08:07,261 --> 02:08:07,261
a move and I was,
you know,

2847
02:08:07,261 --> 02:08:11,230
started dancing around with this 
becoming part of this rhythm.

2848
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:12,070
Wow.

2849
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:16,710
I had an experience once one of the 
first times ever did dmt where I saw the

2850
02:08:16,711 --> 02:08:18,690
difference between negative and positive
thinking.

2851
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:24,020
Like I started thinking negative and 
there was all this like black and dark 

2852
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:25,590
green and like these,
uh,

2853
02:08:25,650 --> 02:08:30,650
threatening shapes and colors and then 
something recognized what was going on 

2854
02:08:33,391 --> 02:08:37,560
in my brain that the shapes and images 
were connected to negative thinking.

2855
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:41,880
And I relaxed in the shapes kind of like
settled down.

2856
02:08:41,881 --> 02:08:46,881
And then I started thinking positive.
Like I heard all these expressions of 

2857
02:08:46,881 --> 02:08:51,801
love,
but like you're hearing it but you're 

2858
02:08:51,801 --> 02:08:53,841
not really hearing it.
It's like the thoughts are getting into 

2859
02:08:53,841 --> 02:08:56,421
your head.
Like someone's trying to say it without 

2860
02:08:56,421 --> 02:08:56,790
using words.
And then I started thinking positive and

2861
02:08:56,791 --> 02:09:01,410
from those dark images blossom these 
like beautiful,

2862
02:09:01,411 --> 02:09:06,411
like geometric flowers and colors and 
impossibly spectacularly beautiful 

2863
02:09:07,081 --> 02:09:08,280
images.
And I was like,

2864
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:09,300
oh.
And I,

2865
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:14,400
I,
I recognized in my mind there is an 

2866
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,560
actual thing that happens when you think
negatively and an actual,

2867
02:09:16,561 --> 02:09:19,770
it's not just some sort of affect the 
program,

2868
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:20,820
they're in a program,

2869
02:09:22,050 --> 02:09:27,050
your thoughts,
the program's coming towards you and 

2870
02:09:27,050 --> 02:09:27,870
your thoughts and it's interacting with 
the program.

2871
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,670
Yeah.
And that's why conflict,

2872
02:09:30,330 --> 02:09:33,270
interpersonal conflict between people 
can be so negative.

2873
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:36,690
It's not just as simple as you and some 
person getting into an argument.

2874
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:41,990
It's those dark images and those 
negative forces becomes a part of your 

2875
02:09:42,211 --> 02:09:42,780
system.

2876
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:46,400
I had exactly the same thing,
so,

2877
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:50,150
but it was almost like a tunnel.
I was in this tunnel and it was the same

2878
02:09:50,151 --> 02:09:50,490
thing.

2879
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:52,710
Yeah.
Oldest

2880
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:56,340
images around and scary and everything.
And I was like,

2881
02:09:57,320 --> 02:10:01,110
I instinctively I knew to be very 
relaxed and I started laughing like,

2882
02:10:01,111 --> 02:10:01,500
fuck you.

2883
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:04,920
And not even real.
You're not even real.

2884
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:06,270
And when I said that

2885
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:09,010
it went away and I just got this thing 
that came into my head.

2886
02:10:09,230 --> 02:10:11,690
You have just been in the valley,
um,

2887
02:10:12,910 --> 02:10:17,910
was a cold.
The Valley of the shadow of death is 

2888
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:17,910
sin.
And the Lord's prayer,

2889
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:20,290
I think though we walk through the 
Valley of the shadow of death,

2890
02:10:20,291 --> 02:10:22,720
I fear no evil because God's bought 
aside.

2891
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:25,570
I vaguely remember from school or 
something,

2892
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:31,020
but I got this thing that you were there
and you're in the valley of the shadow 

2893
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,010
of death and because you like,
fuck you would like,

2894
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:32,890
ah,
it's not even,

2895
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:35,750
it just,
it just disappeared.

2896
02:10:35,751 --> 02:10:37,310
And then it went to somewhere really 
nice.

2897
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:38,450
Wow.

2898
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:41,310
Yeah.
I just wonder how much his real,

2899
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,420
you know,
it's,

2900
02:10:42,430 --> 02:10:45,300
it's such a hippie thing to say like,
how much is real?

2901
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:46,800
I don't know.
You know,

2902
02:10:46,801 --> 02:10:51,801
I've been having these thoughts a lot 
lately about how much of how much of 

2903
02:10:51,961 --> 02:10:54,810
live do you manifest,
how much of life is real?

2904
02:10:54,811 --> 02:10:59,811
Because it's such a bullshit thing to 
think it's such a hippie thing to think 

2905
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:00,450
and so many people that say that are so 
annoying.

2906
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:02,330
Yeah.
But scientists are saying the same thing

2907
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:04,650
now.
Quantum physicists saying,

2908
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:07,870
uh,
it was a fingerstick names.

2909
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:10,370
Profess at guides know if you're 
familiar with him.

2910
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,860
Professor Gates.
And uh,

2911
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:17,920
he said that they've broken down reality
into the smallest level and it's a 

2912
02:11:19,041 --> 02:11:21,020
computer code.
Yes.

2913
02:11:21,021 --> 02:11:26,021
I've seen that gun code.
It's a specific computer code of Zeros 

2914
02:11:26,021 --> 02:11:28,250
and ones.
And it was invented in the 19 forties by

2915
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:28,520
something.

2916
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,110
Yeah,
I've seen that guy being interviewed.

2917
02:11:31,470 --> 02:11:34,890
We actually talked about it with Neil 
degrasse Tyson and he,

2918
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,150
I tried to get him to sort of break it 
down and explain.

2919
02:11:39,390 --> 02:11:44,390
But what it is is essentially that when 
you break reality down to the smallest 

2920
02:11:44,611 --> 02:11:49,611
level,
it mimics a self-correcting computer 

2921
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:50,670
code.
Not just not just a computer code,

2922
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:53,160
but a computer code.
That self correcting,

2923
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:58,400
which is right there.
I just said a bunch of noises that I 

2924
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:58,400
don't even understand.
You know,

2925
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:58,530
it's just,
it's gone beyond

2926
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:04,100
now you're getting a spirituality and 
science coming together because the 

2927
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:05,160
scientists are saying what spiritual 
masters,

2928
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:08,610
they're already telling us that we live 
in an illusion and everything is inside.

2929
02:12:08,611 --> 02:12:13,611
Not outside.
That was saying that thousands of years 

2930
02:12:13,611 --> 02:12:13,611
ago.
But some of it is real,

2931
02:12:13,611 --> 02:12:15,420
like you have to work hard or you don't 
get results,

2932
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:16,590
right?
Like your,

2933
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:21,790
your hard fast,
pragmatic reality of being the best 

2934
02:12:21,790 --> 02:12:24,690
bodybuilder in the world revolves around
actual work,

2935
02:12:24,691 --> 02:12:25,620
real results

2936
02:12:26,210 --> 02:12:28,550
in this,
in this reality and this program,

2937
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:30,580
but also to do physical stuff.
Yeah,

2938
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:34,160
probably there was a lot of mental shit 
going on there too.

2939
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:36,170
Absolutely.
The work was being done,

2940
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:38,540
but also there was probably a lot.
It's

2941
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:43,570
all day.
I mean that's all I thought about like 

2942
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:43,570
literally all fucking day.
So you know,

2943
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:47,510
I had to have the physical goods to make
it happen.

2944
02:12:47,511 --> 02:12:49,590
I could dream about being basketball 
player all day.

2945
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:52,760
It probably wouldn't help me because I'm
not built to be a basketball player,

2946
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:55,790
but those thoughts were just going out 
all the time.

2947
02:12:55,791 --> 02:13:00,791
And I was a kid in Birmingham,
industrial city in England and I was 

2948
02:13:02,031 --> 02:13:04,700
thinking I'm going to go to America and 
I'm going to be a bodybuilder.

2949
02:13:04,701 --> 02:13:07,340
And everyone around me was like the fuck
you took.

2950
02:13:09,010 --> 02:13:09,890
Um,
so yeah,

2951
02:13:09,891 --> 02:13:14,891
that was those thoughts all the time.
So I think it's like a holographic 

2952
02:13:14,891 --> 02:13:17,540
program.
We're in what we influenced it,

2953
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,790
we interact with it,
with our thoughts.

2954
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:24,140
That's kind of where I'm getting at now 
in some way,

2955
02:13:24,230 --> 02:13:29,230
and the guys that were spiritual masters
like Buddha or the guy that called Jesus

2956
02:13:31,741 --> 02:13:36,741
and all that know that apparently did 
things that were called miracles because

2957
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:41,550
they were outside the box,
outside the physical reality we live in.

2958
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:43,590
How can they walk on water that's not 
possible,

2959
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:49,260
but if you are so advanced that you 
really knew it was a program,

2960
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:54,480
then you can like heck the program and 
that's how they able to do it.

2961
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:56,940
They're kind of remove themselves out of
the program.

2962
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:00,690
Yeah.
How can you.

2963
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,730
How can you,
you know,

2964
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:03,570
how can guys levitate or.
Well,

2965
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,610
yeah.
Well,

2966
02:14:05,611 --> 02:14:06,900
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

2967
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:12,050
See that's the thing.
There's no evidence whatsoever that 

2968
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:12,050
anybody actually can levitate.
Well,

2969
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:15,450
people have witnessed people doing it,
but I have witnessed is a lot of.

2970
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:18,620
We'll set some weird shit.
The problem with people saying things as

2971
02:14:18,621 --> 02:14:23,621
they might have literally seen that,
but it doesn't mean it wasn't a 

2972
02:14:23,621 --> 02:14:23,621
hallucination.
And then again,

2973
02:14:23,621 --> 02:14:26,810
it doesn't mean that a hallucination 
isn't an alternative

2974
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,930
reality.
What is it,

2975
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:34,360
you know,
people say you elucidate when you take 

2976
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:35,670
lsd or dmt or just elucidating hio or 
you're just seeing more stuff

2977
02:14:35,690 --> 02:14:37,940
that you can't normally see because now 
you've shifted your,

2978
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:39,140
your,
uh,

2979
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:40,310
your vibration,
you know?

2980
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:41,100
Yeah.
Well,

2981
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:46,280
one of the things that I tried to 
explain to someone about dmt that have 

2982
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:50,901
kind of used over and over again since 
then is that I felt like I met with the 

2983
02:14:51,841 --> 02:14:56,841
divine force of the universe,
like have or he divined forest,

2984
02:14:57,270 --> 02:15:02,270
maybe my puny little brain can only 
comprehend this level of divinity and 

2985
02:15:03,151 --> 02:15:08,151
that maybe perhaps it was something even
more profoundly more powerful and 

2986
02:15:08,151 --> 02:15:11,340
knowledgeable and wise past that,
but I wasn't ready to perceive it.

2987
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:16,520
Then maybe there's levels to that,
that it's fractal just like everything 

2988
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:16,520
else.
And someone said like,

2989
02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:16,970
well,
you know,

2990
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:18,940
how do you know that wasn't a 
hallucination like a.

2991
02:15:18,941 --> 02:15:20,070
well,
it could have been,

2992
02:15:20,071 --> 02:15:25,071
but here's the deal.
Whether or not it was or wasn't the 

2993
02:15:25,071 --> 02:15:28,431
experiences the same.
Like if you really go into some other 

2994
02:15:28,431 --> 02:15:31,461
dimension in God or you take a drug in 
which you experience going to another 

2995
02:15:33,031 --> 02:15:36,330
dimension and meeting God,
it's still the same experience,

2996
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,740
the exact same experience.

2997
02:15:37,750 --> 02:15:42,750
And why?
Why is everybody's experience kind of 

2998
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:42,750
similar,
right.

2999
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:44,200
To have a whole totally different 
fucking illusion.

3000
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:49,320
No one seems to think it's no big deal.
No one that I know who's ever done dmt 

3001
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:49,610
is like,
hey,

3002
02:15:49,930 --> 02:15:54,930
it's no big deal.
You're not going to be the same 

3003
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:54,930
afterwards.
You know,

3004
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:54,930
you get your,
your perspective.

3005
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:57,340
Is it going to a different point of view
is going to be different.

3006
02:15:57,460 --> 02:16:00,270
And uh,
it can only put.

3007
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:03,680
I've never,
I don't know anybody that's done dmt.

3008
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:06,710
And then they've said that was not a 
positive experience.

3009
02:16:06,711 --> 02:16:09,410
I didn't get anything from that.
Every fucking body.

3010
02:16:09,411 --> 02:16:12,260
I know it was said that lot.
Wow,

3011
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:16,830
the fuck,
where am I?

3012
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:20,120
That's like,
what are noises that come from my mouth?

3013
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:21,730
And nobody's like,

3014
02:16:23,170 --> 02:16:28,170
nobody's ever said to me that even the 
guy that I saw that looked like he was 

3015
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:32,901
getting raped by the devil because 
that's that guy getting raped by the 

3016
02:16:32,901 --> 02:16:32,901
download.
I didn't see that,

3017
02:16:32,901 --> 02:16:34,730
but I saw his eyes and that's how I 
imagined somebodies eyes with

3018
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:39,430
like that was happening.
So he looked like

3019
02:16:41,070 --> 02:16:44,900
an absolute terror is all I can say,
absolute terror.

3020
02:16:44,901 --> 02:16:48,180
So in this guy's eyes for like 20 
minutes,

3021
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:49,530
but when it came back it was like,

3022
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:51,350
oh,
this is the guy that was.

3023
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:52,760
He didn't even know.
I'm like,

3024
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:54,290
you okay dude.
Yeah man,

3025
02:16:54,291 --> 02:16:56,700
that was fucking great.
Like,

3026
02:16:58,990 --> 02:17:01,280
do you know what happened?
It was great.

3027
02:17:02,030 --> 02:17:04,340
Okay,
you need to watch this video when you go

3028
02:17:04,341 --> 02:17:05,520
home because we fell into man.

3029
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:09,150
I had a friend,
my friend Doug Stan hope and he's talked

3030
02:17:09,151 --> 02:17:14,151
about this many times on stage.
I got him high on Dmt at my house and 

3031
02:17:14,151 --> 02:17:18,531
uh,
he's the only guy that I've ever got 

3032
02:17:18,531 --> 02:17:20,721
high on dmt that I worried about because
he fell over on the couch and started 

3033
02:17:20,721 --> 02:17:22,800
moaning and like foam was coming out of 
his mouth.

3034
02:17:23,190 --> 02:17:26,070
He was,
but he's so unhealthy.

3035
02:17:26,490 --> 02:17:29,250
He smoked cigarettes.
He drinks constantly.

3036
02:17:29,310 --> 02:17:30,990
And I was like,
oh my God,

3037
02:17:30,991 --> 02:17:33,990
did I break my friend that I was really 
worried.

3038
02:17:33,991 --> 02:17:38,991
I was like,
maybe I should have considered the fact 

3039
02:17:38,991 --> 02:17:38,991
this fucking guy doesn't really

3040
02:17:38,991 --> 02:17:38,991
take care of things.
Uh,

3041
02:17:38,991 --> 02:17:40,220
I think when your system's kind of 
toxic,

3042
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,170
you don't get the best.

3043
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:43,200
Oh,
he came out of it.

3044
02:17:43,201 --> 02:17:45,270
He got great results.
He came out of it.

3045
02:17:45,271 --> 02:17:50,271
It was a fantastic experience for him.
He came out of it with all these 

3046
02:17:50,271 --> 02:17:51,210
revelations.
We had great conversation about it,

3047
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:56,660
but in the moment he was like,
and I was like,

3048
02:17:59,070 --> 02:18:00,990
oh no,
I've killed him.

3049
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:06,100
Oh,
this guy was like spasm him and kicking 

3050
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:08,591
him.
And my friend had to hold him on the 

3051
02:18:08,591 --> 02:18:08,591
floor to stop him smashing the furniture
in the south.

3052
02:18:08,591 --> 02:18:09,230
So.
Wow.

3053
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:12,110
And it was like thinking he was being 
chosen 10 minutes.

3054
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:13,370
Oh Gosh.
15,

3055
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:15,680
20.
Oh God.

3056
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:17,700
I was like,
I was starting to get concerned.

3057
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:20,660
Like Jesus Christ,
half an hour later he came out of it,

3058
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:25,690
but he's glad he did it.
Now that he couldn't see himself at the 

3059
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:25,960
time.
Know.

3060
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:29,770
Do you ever a float a flotation tank?
Yeah,

3061
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,700
I did it once.
And you know,

3062
02:18:31,701 --> 02:18:33,200
funny enough,
when I was a kid,

3063
02:18:33,201 --> 02:18:38,201
I read Frank Zane,
Frank Zane was doing flotation tanks 

3064
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:38,201
back in the seventies.
Yeah,

3065
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:42,621
those Samati tanks.
So I always wanted to do it and I saw 

3066
02:18:42,621 --> 02:18:46,451
this place when I was over in England.
So I went in there and I said to the 

3067
02:18:46,821 --> 02:18:48,290
guy,
like talking about it,

3068
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:49,400
I said,
listen man,

3069
02:18:49,401 --> 02:18:51,800
let me ask you a question.
I said,

3070
02:18:51,801 --> 02:18:53,600
is it good to smoke weed before you go 
in there?

3071
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:55,410
And he's like,
I'll tell you the truth.

3072
02:18:55,411 --> 02:18:56,450
He said,
a lot of people come here,

3073
02:18:56,460 --> 02:18:58,190
they smoke weed outside before they come
in.

3074
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:03,520
He said,
but the first time I think it should 

3075
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:03,520
just go with nothing and see how it 
goes.

3076
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:08,250
And I'll be honest,
I was in there for like an hour thing 

3077
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:08,690
after 40 minutes,
I just got really fucking bored.

3078
02:19:11,660 --> 02:19:13,460
I thought to myself,
I meditate every day,

3079
02:19:13,461 --> 02:19:13,780
every day.

3080
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:15,170
Uh,
so I was like,

3081
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:17,630
this is like,
don't fail.

3082
02:19:17,631 --> 02:19:20,210
This is any better than major in my 
meditation.

3083
02:19:20,211 --> 02:19:23,330
I just getting kind of the same thing.
So really I wasn't,

3084
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:26,540
I wasn't blown away by it.
Like I expected to be to be honest,

3085
02:19:26,541 --> 02:19:27,320
but then,
you know,

3086
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:28,310
done dmt

3087
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:30,470
and I'll ask her and asset and 
everything.

3088
02:19:30,471 --> 02:19:34,090
So maybe my expectations were too high.
Um,

3089
02:19:34,130 --> 02:19:38,030
I always give the same advice I give.
I say don't smoke weed the first time,

3090
02:19:38,031 --> 02:19:42,590
just go in and experience it,
but my thoughts are that isolation tanks

3091
02:19:42,810 --> 02:19:47,810
and the isolation tank experience is 
something that it takes time to really 

3092
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:52,181
fully relax and settle in and there's 
layers to the onion and you got to go 

3093
02:19:52,221 --> 02:19:54,800
deeper and deeper and peel those layers 
away.

3094
02:19:55,010 --> 02:20:00,010
And I've done it so many times.
I have one in my basement and so I've 

3095
02:20:00,010 --> 02:20:00,560
done it so many times now that when I go
in,

3096
02:20:00,561 --> 02:20:03,980
I can slide right in almost immediately.
But I'll tell you this,

3097
02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:09,140
I rarely go in sober.
I almost always go in high as a kite and

3098
02:20:09,380 --> 02:20:12,800
edibles preferably or the best way to 
really.

3099
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:18,160
I can have full blown psychedelic 
experiences in the tank on edibles,

3100
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:20,600
full blown visuals.

3101
02:20:20,810 --> 02:20:22,610
Well,
going into the jungle,

3102
02:20:22,611 --> 02:20:26,000
experiencing the center of the universe,
like intense,

3103
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:29,670
intense stuff because the relaxation,
the,

3104
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:34,680
the,
the fact that you are the only 

3105
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:37,031
information you're taking in is there's 
a mild feeling of the water on your 

3106
02:20:37,371 --> 02:20:42,371
body,
very mild that you have to think about 

3107
02:20:42,371 --> 02:20:43,340
to be aware of and occasionally you'll 
touch the sides of the tank and you have

3108
02:20:43,341 --> 02:20:48,341
to kind of write yourself.
There's no some water gets in there or 

3109
02:20:48,341 --> 02:20:48,341
something,
but other than that,

3110
02:20:48,341 --> 02:20:50,120
I don't rub your eyes,
get salt dries as a bad one,

3111
02:20:50,390 --> 02:20:51,340
but other than that,
you're,

3112
02:20:51,341 --> 02:20:54,000
you're experiencing no sound,
no,

3113
02:20:54,010 --> 02:20:57,440
no visual input,
and in the absence of that visual input,

3114
02:20:57,441 --> 02:21:00,230
I think all those other thoughts become 
more powerful.

3115
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:05,530
So whatever the effect of marijuana is 
an irregular body when you're just 

3116
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:06,530
hanging out,
sitting around.

3117
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:12,250
That effect is intensified in a big way 
when you're in the back and try that 

3118
02:21:13,041 --> 02:21:18,041
next time,
but when you're in town I can hook it 

3119
02:21:18,041 --> 02:21:18,041
up.

3120
02:21:18,041 --> 02:21:18,041
Alright,
cool.

3121
02:21:18,041 --> 02:21:18,041
If you want,
how many,

3122
02:21:18,041 --> 02:21:18,260
how many times are you in town for?
How long you in town?

3123
02:21:18,261 --> 02:21:23,261
For a we're on a hips so Thursday 
evening and go to vegas to do a 

3124
02:21:23,261 --> 02:21:24,950
competition that.
Well they have them in Vegas too now.

3125
02:21:25,010 --> 02:21:27,950
They have everywhere to make.
When I first started doing the tank,

3126
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:33,010
I first.
My first experience I think was in the 

3127
02:21:33,010 --> 02:21:35,681
early,
early two thousands and I got my first 

3128
02:21:35,681 --> 02:21:35,840
tank in 2003 because when I bought my 
house,

3129
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:39,050
one of the reasons why I bought it is it
had a basement and I was like,

3130
02:21:39,051 --> 02:21:42,740
I want a place to put the tank.
And because I had done the tank a couple

3131
02:21:42,741 --> 02:21:45,600
of times at this place called soothing 
solutions in Burbank.

3132
02:21:45,620 --> 02:21:47,000
Yeah.
If you've got it there and you can do it

3133
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:52,001
every day then oh it's the best.
I'll do it at night and I get home from 

3134
02:21:52,001 --> 02:21:55,331
a comedy show and I'll say I need to 
process my thoughts and go over my 

3135
02:21:55,331 --> 02:21:59,171
material and I'll climb in that tank and
just take off to the center of the 

3136
02:21:59,171 --> 02:22:02,150
universe and figure things out and also 
makes me reconsider like how my thoughts

3137
02:22:02,151 --> 02:22:02,240
are.

3138
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:04,960
Be like one of the things about comedy 
is you know,

3139
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:10,060
you have an idea and you've got to try 
to figure out a way to get that idea 

3140
02:22:10,060 --> 02:22:11,220
into people's minds and sometimes it's 
the wrong way.

3141
02:22:11,221 --> 02:22:15,170
Like sometimes it's too abrupt or too 
corrosive or it's too,

3142
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,790
it's just not,
it's not,

3143
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:20,020
it's not smoothly getting into people's 
minds,

3144
02:22:20,021 --> 02:22:25,021
so you have to like really consider it.
So that idea of seeing other people's 

3145
02:22:25,531 --> 02:22:27,930
perspectives like that we were talking 
about earlier,

3146
02:22:28,170 --> 02:22:33,170
that's huge with standup comedy and one 
of the best ways to kind of get out of 

3147
02:22:33,170 --> 02:22:37,071
your own way for me is to explore things
in the tank because in the absence of 

3148
02:22:37,071 --> 02:22:41,721
any physical input,
he kind of stopped thinking of your body

3149
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:46,910
and your brain and you as an individual 
as like the captain of the ship and all 

3150
02:22:48,391 --> 02:22:51,300
the other things start to become more 
and more.

3151
02:22:51,710 --> 02:22:56,710
You've got more room to us.
Well that's the idea is like you and I 

3152
02:22:56,710 --> 02:23:00,441
are having this conversation,
but one of the reasons why I like to do 

3153
02:23:00,441 --> 02:23:00,441
it in this room with no one else here 
but us.

3154
02:23:00,441 --> 02:23:01,860
So there's no distractions,
right?

3155
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:03,990
But if there was a guy in the other room
with a Jackhammer,

3156
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:06,180
it would fuck us up.
We'd want to get out of there.

3157
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:11,240
Right?
We want to it go over here so we can 

3158
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:11,240
talk more quietly in the gym.
You want to go to the gym?

3159
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:14,601
You want to be sure.
That's why a lot of guys put headphones 

3160
02:23:14,601 --> 02:23:14,601
on,
right?

3161
02:23:14,601 --> 02:23:14,970
You just want to fucking grind and get 
in your own head.

3162
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:18,330
Well,
in life itself,

3163
02:23:18,331 --> 02:23:23,331
like while we're sitting here,
your chair is sending signals to your 

3164
02:23:23,331 --> 02:23:23,331
ass.
You don't have your hands on the table.

3165
02:23:23,331 --> 02:23:24,660
It's all data in the tank.

3166
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:27,420
There's nothing.
And in the absence of sensory input,

3167
02:23:27,421 --> 02:23:32,421
I believe that your brain become 
supercharged and I think you can 

3168
02:23:32,421 --> 02:23:33,000
consider things in a much more clear 
way.

3169
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:35,340
I think you have more resources.
As I said,

3170
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:40,550
I find the same with meditation.
It's like when I've tried to explain to 

3171
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:40,550
people,
as I said,

3172
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:42,300
it's almost like I feel like it's slowed
down my thought process.

3173
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:46,650
So now when I have thoughts,
I see them coming in and I'm like,

3174
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:51,660
don't wanna act on this thought or not.
Whereas before I already acted on it 

3175
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:52,220
before it was,
you know,

3176
02:23:52,221 --> 02:23:57,221
I recognize that that's a huge problem 
as being a reactionary person and 

3177
02:23:57,221 --> 02:24:01,760
constantly dealing with input coming in 
and the like instinctively batting it 

3178
02:24:01,951 --> 02:24:06,840
away or stay stressed and anxious.
You are always going to react like that.

3179
02:24:06,841 --> 02:24:11,130
So you need to get rid of all that and 
people know that.

3180
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:16,140
I think that's one of the reasons why 
people have a real problem with 

3181
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:18,711
president trump.
One of the real problems we have with 

3182
02:24:18,711 --> 02:24:22,011
them like this,
the guy that argues with people on 

3183
02:24:22,011 --> 02:24:22,100
twitter gets mad and it was nail on the 
wwe.

3184
02:24:22,510 --> 02:24:24,360
Wasn't that perfect training to be the 
president.

3185
02:24:24,361 --> 02:24:26,550
But that's fun.
That's silly to me.

3186
02:24:26,551 --> 02:24:28,470
I mean that's the same thing,
man.

3187
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:32,280
You're performing familiar.
That's just what,

3188
02:24:32,281 --> 02:24:33,870
uh,
you know,

3189
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:36,360
the president,
how much power does it really have?

3190
02:24:36,361 --> 02:24:41,361
How much influence or is it just a,
just a pantomime that destruction for 

3191
02:24:41,361 --> 02:24:45,741
people.
But that was before he was president 

3192
02:24:45,741 --> 02:24:46,680
when I'm reacting to is like him 
tweeting things today,

3193
02:24:46,681 --> 02:24:49,020
like shitting on people,
insulting people.

3194
02:24:49,290 --> 02:24:52,410
Like when you're the fucking president 
of the United States,

3195
02:24:52,411 --> 02:24:57,411
he the leader of the free world.
You can't be going on twitter and just 

3196
02:24:57,411 --> 02:24:59,790
insulting people,
putting out that conflict energy that we

3197
02:24:59,791 --> 02:25:03,300
were talking about for what reason?
If people recognize whether they know it

3198
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:08,301
or not,
inherently they know that this is not 

3199
02:25:08,301 --> 02:25:09,090
the way to lead.
This is not the way to be above it all.

3200
02:25:09,091 --> 02:25:12,150
This is not the wise person that we want
at the top of the hill.

3201
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:14,640
Setting the standards for all the people
who have a.

3202
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:19,050
which was your alternative.
There's no alternative,

3203
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:24,400
but you go,
I don't think there should be a 

3204
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:24,400
president and I've said this a million 
times.

3205
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:24,400
I just think there's too much power.
Does

3206
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,960
the president really have.
I mean you had to Obama,

3207
02:25:25,961 --> 02:25:30,961
right?
He said it was going to close down 

3208
02:25:30,961 --> 02:25:30,961
Guantanamo Bay.
Yeah.

3209
02:25:30,961 --> 02:25:31,030
Great.
But it didn't happen.

3210
02:25:31,570 --> 02:25:33,070
I don't want to know why did he want to 
do it,

3211
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:38,400
but he couldn't because other people are
really in control or maybe they want to 

3212
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:38,400
do

3213
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:38,400
bullshit.
I'm like,

3214
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:38,840
why?
They shouldn't do it.

3215
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:42,440
There couldn't be a bunch of factors.
I don't know,

3216
02:25:42,630 --> 02:25:44,880
but I think maybe you go there with good
intentions,

3217
02:25:44,881 --> 02:25:48,250
but there's other people that pull us,
pull the strings and you know,

3218
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:49,620
presidents,
just a front guy

3219
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:54,920
in that sense.
One of the things about trump being so 

3220
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:57,090
bold and so egotistical,
I think that's probably a positive,

3221
02:25:57,091 --> 02:26:02,091
is that he's resisting the deep state.
He's resisting all of these other 

3222
02:26:02,091 --> 02:26:06,381
outside influences.
Any so wealthy that he has the financial

3223
02:26:06,571 --> 02:26:11,571
power to insulate himself from these 
other people that are like him.

3224
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:12,430
Well,
I,

3225
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:14,750
you know,
I got friends in the states and that was

3226
02:26:14,751 --> 02:26:16,120
the feedback that I got.
The,

3227
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:21,140
the guys that liked trump,
they liked him because I felt that it 

3228
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:21,140
wasn't gonna be controlled by the,
you know,

3229
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:22,240
the big money,
uh,

3230
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:27,760
the,
the guys that own the Federal Reserve 

3231
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:29,681
and,
or pulling the strings on the military 

3232
02:26:29,681 --> 02:26:29,681
and all that stuff.
But I don't,

3233
02:26:29,681 --> 02:26:32,150
I don't think you can have,
I don't think you can beat those guys,

3234
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:34,430
you know,
control the money system,

3235
02:26:34,431 --> 02:26:35,300
the control,
everything.

3236
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:37,820
It's a mess.
I think I like your idea.

3237
02:26:37,821 --> 02:26:38,960
We need to get them all fucked up.

3238
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:43,120
So let's get hillary stoned and make a 
real nice,

3239
02:26:43,121 --> 02:26:44,500
cool lady.
And she would just go,

3240
02:26:44,501 --> 02:26:49,501
I have cancer.
I confess is a picture of a deer that 

3241
02:26:53,291 --> 02:26:55,180
was on the side of the road that was 
dead.

3242
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:57,250
And you know,
those one of those comic memes.

3243
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,590
And it said,
what did this deer know about?

3244
02:26:59,591 --> 02:27:04,591
Hillary Clinton seems to be dangerous to
know too much about Hillary and Bill 

3245
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:10,920
Clinton.
People were killed just in the last 

3246
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:11,860
couple of weeks that committed suicide.
A lot of people know this shit,

3247
02:27:11,861 --> 02:27:12,540
right?
So like,

3248
02:27:12,590 --> 02:27:17,590
we've got this fucking psychopath.
Well we've got this idiot guy that but 

3249
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:20,510
maybe is a better alternative than the 
psychopath.

3250
02:27:20,511 --> 02:27:25,160
So let's go with the orange guy with the
orange guy because he's,

3251
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:27,440
you know,
his not part of this cabal.

3252
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:30,500
And maybe he's gonna he's gonna change 
things for the better.

3253
02:27:30,501 --> 02:27:35,501
So that's why people went with him.
I believe because he was seen to be not 

3254
02:27:36,501 --> 02:27:40,070
controlled by the same forces,
if you like the,

3255
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:40,910
you know,
the Clintons,

3256
02:27:40,911 --> 02:27:42,020
the bushes,
the fucking,

3257
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:44,000
all these people,
they're on the same club.

3258
02:27:44,001 --> 02:27:44,240
Right.

3259
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:46,100
Well,
it just seems that change,

3260
02:27:46,220 --> 02:27:48,830
especially change over our culture,
you know,

3261
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:53,860
over a civilization happens in these 
like slow ticks to the right or ticks to

3262
02:27:54,201 --> 02:27:59,201
the left,
moving in a good direction or a bad 

3263
02:27:59,201 --> 02:28:01,560
direction is so.
It's so slow to change and like,

3264
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:05,840
so when something like this comes around
that is perceived to be a negative thing

3265
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:10,160
and it's perceived to be a negative 
thing moving in a terrible direction and

3266
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:12,680
quite rapidly.
It scares the shit out of people.

3267
02:28:13,170 --> 02:28:15,520
Well,
that's the feedback I get now.

3268
02:28:15,521 --> 02:28:16,680
If people over here,
they,

3269
02:28:16,750 --> 02:28:17,780
they're concerned,
you know?

3270
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:23,850
Well of course not.
I don't think it makes that much who is 

3271
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:23,850
president.
So it's just a,

3272
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:27,410
it's just a fucking side show to 
entertain people came distracted.

3273
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:29,210
Do you think that's on purpose?
I got all.

3274
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:30,980
Yeah,
that old emotional like,

3275
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:32,070
oh,
trump is a,

3276
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:37,320
uh,
it's like it's just bullshit is a 

3277
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:39,980
pantone.
Mine is just to keep you distracted and 

3278
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:40,550
I keep you entertained,
just like football and everything else,

3279
02:28:40,551 --> 02:28:42,710
like don't look over here,
look over here.

3280
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:43,830
So magicians trick in.

3281
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:46,720
Wow.
Wow.

3282
02:28:47,170 --> 02:28:52,170
I like to think that way sometimes.
Then other times I think it's probably 

3283
02:28:52,170 --> 02:28:55,351
just too complicated for anybody to 
really orchestrate and we're just 

3284
02:28:55,351 --> 02:28:58,471
reacting to these wants and needs and 
human instincts and all a variety of 

3285
02:28:58,871 --> 02:29:03,871
factors that have been set in motion,
like the momentum of these things that 

3286
02:29:03,871 --> 02:29:07,741
have been set in motion forever and 
people trying to profit and people 

3287
02:29:07,741 --> 02:29:07,741
trying to figure out how to control 
various factions of it,

3288
02:29:07,741 --> 02:29:11,410
but the idea of like one person or one 
group pulling the strings,

3289
02:29:11,950 --> 02:29:15,460
it's not as clear cut as that,
but I find it less and less plausible.

3290
02:29:15,490 --> 02:29:20,490
Yeah.
This is a small group that controls 

3291
02:29:20,490 --> 02:29:20,490
that.
The debt.

3292
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:25,580
It's not even money instead.
So if your control that then it can 

3293
02:29:25,580 --> 02:29:26,500
control pretty much everything,
right?

3294
02:29:26,610 --> 02:29:30,040
Isn't everybody in debt is every country
in debt is in China in debt to.

3295
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:31,270
So who.
Exactly.

3296
02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:36,610
That's fair.
If everybody is in debt to everybody,

3297
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:42,120
like,
is that really dead fucking front money 

3298
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:42,240
and put a number on a thing and you 
know,

3299
02:29:42,580 --> 02:29:45,130
you owe us x amount,
let's just cancel a debt.

3300
02:29:45,580 --> 02:29:46,120
Yeah,

3301
02:29:46,770 --> 02:29:51,770
no,
that's why they distracted with things 

3302
02:29:51,770 --> 02:29:51,780
like we've got to go after medical 
marijuana like that jeff sessions guy.

3303
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:54,090
He's,
he's the ultimate distraction.

3304
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:57,930
It's going to start crying,
kind of versus like,

3305
02:29:58,530 --> 02:30:03,530
that's a huge thing in the evolution of 
consciousness and it's getting more 

3306
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:06,990
available and more accepted and uh,
the so many layers to it,

3307
02:30:06,991 --> 02:30:08,850
man.
It's like medically,

3308
02:30:09,390 --> 02:30:11,220
it's amazing.
Spiritually.

3309
02:30:11,221 --> 02:30:14,000
It's amazing.
It's a hemp plant.

3310
02:30:14,001 --> 02:30:18,540
Can fucking supply what you know.
Henry Ford built the model t ford out of

3311
02:30:18,610 --> 02:30:19,980
Hamp Hempcrete,
right?

3312
02:30:20,370 --> 02:30:22,230
Not only that,
it's way stronger.

3313
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:26,010
So why is it with a hammer?
He hits the fenders and rust.

3314
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:28,080
It's lighter,
you know,

3315
02:30:28,081 --> 02:30:30,420
everything.
He filled it with ethanol as well.

3316
02:30:30,450 --> 02:30:31,630
So did you ever see you see

3317
02:30:31,630 --> 02:30:36,010
them make that a video where they have 
him hit the hammer against the offender?

3318
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:39,800
It's like the first model t they had met
fenders.

3319
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:44,860
They had made them out of hemp and he's 
whacking it with a fucking hammer and 

3320
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:49,920
hammer.
The people don't understand if you've 

3321
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:52,081
never experienced it,
the hemp stalk the actual stock of the 

3322
02:30:52,081 --> 02:30:55,471
tree itself.
It'll get very big and thick and it's 

3323
02:30:55,471 --> 02:30:57,100
extremely hard,
but extremely light.

3324
02:30:57,130 --> 02:31:00,270
It's not like any other wood is light 
light wiring.

3325
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:04,450
It's fucking hard like oak,
but light like Balsa Wood.

3326
02:31:04,451 --> 02:31:06,010
Look at this.
That is hemp.

3327
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:11,220
So he's banging his hammer against this 
fucking car and it's not even making a 

3328
02:31:11,831 --> 02:31:16,831
dent.
So tell me why it didn't build the car 

3329
02:31:16,831 --> 02:31:16,960
out of because of William Randolph 
hearst.

3330
02:31:16,961 --> 02:31:21,961
That fucking cunt.
William Randolph was the guy who owned 

3331
02:31:21,961 --> 02:31:24,060
hearst publications.
He also owned a bunch of paper mills and

3332
02:31:24,061 --> 02:31:26,070
he's the guy who demonized him.

3333
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:31,100
He's also the guy that was the 
motivation for Orson Wells to make the 

3334
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:33,750
movie Rosebud.
You are the movie citizen Kane Rather.

3335
02:31:33,751 --> 02:31:37,770
He was in the oil and steel industries 
as well.

3336
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:42,800
It has to do with a lot of things,
but a big part of it was William 

3337
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:46,310
Randolph hearst because they had a cover
of popular science magazine that was 

3338
02:31:46,310 --> 02:31:49,851
like hemp.
The new billion dollar crop and they 

3339
02:31:49,851 --> 02:31:52,821
made that because there was a.
There was a device that was invented 

3340
02:31:52,821 --> 02:31:54,900
called the decorticator and what a 
decorticator was.

3341
02:31:54,901 --> 02:31:59,901
It was a machine that allowed you to 
effectively process the hemp fiber 

3342
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:02,370
without the use of slavery.
See,

3343
02:32:02,371 --> 02:32:07,371
for years and years they had used 
slavery to process hemp and hemp was 

3344
02:32:07,371 --> 02:32:11,481
what they used for canvas.
That's why I can have the name canvas 

3345
02:32:11,481 --> 02:32:11,680
comes from the word cannabis.
That's.

3346
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:15,180
That's literally Lamont.
He wrote the declaration of independence

3347
02:32:15,181 --> 02:32:17,580
on him,
so the first drafts on hemp paper,

3348
02:32:17,581 --> 02:32:18,990
it's a far superior paper.

3349
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:21,330
Then wood pulp paper.
Well,

3350
02:32:21,331 --> 02:32:24,840
when they had come out with this article
in popular science magazine,

3351
02:32:24,841 --> 02:32:26,280
hemp,
the new billion dollar crop,

3352
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:31,520
they were essentially saying that hemp,
because of the decorticator now hemp 

3353
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:33,270
would replace Wood for paper for all 
these other things,

3354
02:32:33,271 --> 02:32:35,280
so I don't need to destroy the forest 
animal.

3355
02:32:35,490 --> 02:32:39,390
William Randolf hearst not only owned 
these newspapers,

3356
02:32:39,391 --> 02:32:44,391
but he also owned these paper mills and 
he owned these forests and he decided to

3357
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:50,160
combat this competing industry with 
propaganda.

3358
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:55,340
So they started printing these stories 
about how these black people and 

3359
02:32:55,340 --> 02:32:57,990
Mexicans were taking this wild drug.
Marijuana women.

3360
02:32:58,020 --> 02:33:00,300
Exactly.
And then everybody was like Jesus.

3361
02:33:00,360 --> 02:33:03,030
So when the.
When Congress first made marijuana,

3362
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:08,060
first of all,
marijuana was not even the word for 

3363
02:33:08,060 --> 02:33:11,331
cannabis.
Marijuana was a word for a wild Mexican 

3364
02:33:11,331 --> 02:33:12,600
tobacco that had nothing to do with it.
As Mexican.

3365
02:33:12,750 --> 02:33:15,960
It was the exactly careful danger,
danger to the cross,

3366
02:33:15,961 --> 02:33:17,410
the border around ones.

3367
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:21,960
And so they people responded to this and
they,

3368
02:33:22,110 --> 02:33:27,110
when they made it illegal,
they didn't even understand that they 

3369
02:33:27,110 --> 02:33:27,110
were making cannabis.
They didn't notice to understand.

3370
02:33:27,110 --> 02:33:31,071
They were making the,
the commodity hemp illegal like to this 

3371
02:33:31,071 --> 02:33:34,020
day until recently on it.
We sell hemp protein.

3372
02:33:34,170 --> 02:33:37,110
When we first started on it several 
years ago,

3373
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:42,320
we had to buy all of our hemp from 
Canada because even though it's not 

3374
02:33:42,320 --> 02:33:44,520
psychoactive,
it was illegal still to grow in America.

3375
02:33:45,140 --> 02:33:48,240
It's so stupid.
It's just so tied,

3376
02:33:48,241 --> 02:33:50,220
technically stupid.
But the,

3377
02:33:50,221 --> 02:33:52,080
you know,
there's a,

3378
02:33:52,081 --> 02:33:55,170
there's a crack in the dam now that you 
kind of stop it,

3379
02:33:55,171 --> 02:33:58,370
man.
That bowl was rolling now and people are

3380
02:33:58,530 --> 02:34:00,240
waking up to the benefits,
you know,

3381
02:34:00,250 --> 02:34:05,250
how many states you're gotten in us now 
that's legal is quite a few medical and 

3382
02:34:05,250 --> 02:34:08,790
I think there's something like,
what is it like nine recreational,

3383
02:34:08,791 --> 02:34:10,470
Nevada,
Massachusetts,

3384
02:34:10,471 --> 02:34:12,030
California,
Oregon,

3385
02:34:12,031 --> 02:34:15,480
Washington state,
Washington,

3386
02:34:15,481 --> 02:34:17,500
DC that I say that already.

3387
02:34:17,970 --> 02:34:21,940
Um,
I don't know.

3388
02:34:21,941 --> 02:34:26,170
I mean the other ones there are main 
Alaska,

3389
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:28,420
Colorado,
of course.

3390
02:34:28,930 --> 02:34:31,690
Yeah.
So how many of them legalized canvas?

3391
02:34:31,691 --> 02:34:32,320
One,
two,

3392
02:34:32,321 --> 02:34:32,860
three,
four,

3393
02:34:32,861 --> 02:34:34,150
five,
six,

3394
02:34:34,151 --> 02:34:35,380
seven,
seven,

3395
02:34:35,381 --> 02:34:40,381
legalized.
And then jurisdiction with medical 

3396
02:34:40,381 --> 02:34:40,570
decriminalization that there's a lot of 
funky,

3397
02:34:40,571 --> 02:34:45,571
weird shades too,
that there's more than three shades 

3398
02:34:45,571 --> 02:34:48,640
there.
You just make it illegal across the 

3399
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:48,640
board.
Well,

3400
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:49,330
it takes time,
man.

3401
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:54,600
The amount of money.
What's fascinating is the amount of 

3402
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:56,731
money that is coming in and that's 
affecting it because these people are 

3403
02:34:56,731 --> 02:34:58,630
getting into Colorado.
The was massive.

3404
02:34:58,740 --> 02:35:02,590
Put it back into the school systems and 
the metal giving people tax refunds.

3405
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:07,650
Sorry,
we made too much money tax at 39 

3406
02:35:07,650 --> 02:35:07,650
percent.
And everybody's like,

3407
02:35:07,650 --> 02:35:08,710
okay,
nobody gives a shit.

3408
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:10,780
I read that in,
in Nevada,

3409
02:35:10,781 --> 02:35:12,850
in vegas that literally running out.
Oh yeah.

3410
02:35:13,460 --> 02:35:14,050
Urgency.
Oh,

3411
02:35:14,390 --> 02:35:14,890
that's right.

3412
02:35:17,350 --> 02:35:22,350
Yeah.
Well I hope not because I'm going there 

3413
02:35:22,350 --> 02:35:22,350
Saturday.
Oh,

3414
02:35:22,350 --> 02:35:22,350
they'll get you some.
I'll hook it up.

3415
02:35:22,350 --> 02:35:26,100
I know people,
Nevada declares marijuana state of 

3416
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:28,591
emergency to avoid $100,000,000
tax shortfall because they wanted the 

3417
02:35:28,591 --> 02:35:33,091
money from the marijuana because they 
were making so much money in taxes 

3418
02:35:33,091 --> 02:35:34,780
because I think,
I think Nevada has 39 percent as well,

3419
02:35:34,781 --> 02:35:36,880
right?
They had a 39 percent tax rate.

3420
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:39,670
If it's 15 for recreational,
only 15.

3421
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:41,300
Really think so.
Well,

3422
02:35:41,301 --> 02:35:42,910
they fucked up.
They should've went 39.

3423
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:47,940
Nobody gives a shit.
It's still five bucks for when you're 

3424
02:35:47,940 --> 02:35:47,940
buying it.
I don't know if this,

3425
02:35:47,940 --> 02:35:48,460
the works are getting texts too for what
they sell.

3426
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:50,240
Recreational marijuana tax

3427
02:35:50,330 --> 02:35:52,600
fingers.
The bowl was all in as not going to stop

3428
02:35:52,601 --> 02:35:53,470
now.
And uh,

3429
02:35:54,340 --> 02:35:59,340
so many people out there have cured 
cancer as well about using the 

3430
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:02,671
concentrated oil and stuff.
I got a couple of friends that have 

3431
02:36:02,671 --> 02:36:03,550
cured their own concept from changing 
the Diet,

3432
02:36:04,430 --> 02:36:09,430
uh,
go into a plant based alkaline diet and 

3433
02:36:09,430 --> 02:36:10,660
taking the cannabis oil.
And the doctors are like baffled.

3434
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:12,550
Yeah.
So there's that.

3435
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:15,370
And that's a powerful thing.
If somebody kills a concert,

3436
02:36:15,371 --> 02:36:20,371
they're going to tell everybody.
I tell everybody they know all their 

3437
02:36:20,371 --> 02:36:20,540
family and it's just a matter of time.
Yeah.

3438
02:36:20,910 --> 02:36:24,370
They just had something on the,
on a mainstream,

3439
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:29,400
which I was surprised a mainstream a 
news show in England where they had this

3440
02:36:30,131 --> 02:36:32,440
case of this kid who was in hospital is 
dying from.

3441
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:34,030
Can't remember what it was.
But anyway,

3442
02:36:34,031 --> 02:36:39,031
just the point is his mother was 
sneaking in the cannabis oil and he got 

3443
02:36:39,761 --> 02:36:44,761
cured for that.
And then they did this whole thing on 

3444
02:36:44,761 --> 02:36:44,761
the breakfast tv about how the,
you know,

3445
02:36:44,761 --> 02:36:48,790
the kitchen was got rid of his constant.
Now what I noticed,

3446
02:36:48,791 --> 02:36:50,410
they still,
you know,

3447
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:53,320
the obviously told to say this or that,
you know,

3448
02:36:53,321 --> 02:36:55,300
there's told this whole story about the 
kid is like,

3449
02:36:55,390 --> 02:37:00,390
you know,
it's kind of gone now because his mom 

3450
02:37:00,390 --> 02:37:00,390
was sneaking in the cannabis oil and 
wow,

3451
02:37:00,390 --> 02:37:00,610
we need to look into this.
But,

3452
02:37:01,150 --> 02:37:02,950
but we must state everybody.
People,

3453
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:05,920
we must tell you that we must,
you know,

3454
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:07,420
it's not a cure.
Right?

3455
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:13,120
What the fuck you're talking about?
The kids killed while you're talking 

3456
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:13,120
about,
it's not a cure,

3457
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:14,060
but it's obviously something they've got
to state,

3458
02:37:14,450 --> 02:37:16,040
you know,
because it's actually illegal to

3459
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:18,170
claim that you can cure cancer.

3460
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:20,690
Well,
it's illegal to possess the marijuana,

3461
02:37:20,691 --> 02:37:25,691
so it's illegal probably to use it as a 
treatment even though it's effective,

3462
02:37:25,701 --> 02:37:27,740
you have to say it's not a cure.
Exactly.

3463
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:32,780
Under the influence of the 
pharmaceutical drug companies that will 

3464
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:35,591
come down.
I mean there's pharmaceutical drug 

3465
02:37:35,591 --> 02:37:35,591
companies that advertise on these 
networks,

3466
02:37:35,591 --> 02:37:40,090
which becomes a huge problem because of 
their advertising abilify and fucking 

3467
02:37:40,090 --> 02:37:42,560
Welbutrin and all this different shit 
that they're selling.

3468
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:48,010
They're not going to be interested in 
you telling positive stories about 

3469
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:50,030
abandoning all pharmaceutical drugs.
Then taking natural remedies,

3470
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:53,730
of course not as competent it.
So what they're trying to do now is make

3471
02:37:54,170 --> 02:37:59,170
you know,
slightly different versions of it that 

3472
02:37:59,170 --> 02:38:02,101
the complaintant a swan company,
I think at Gw pharmaceuticals and UK.

3473
02:38:02,850 --> 02:38:03,480
What?
Guess what?

3474
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:06,360
It doesn't fucking work when you do 
that.

3475
02:38:06,450 --> 02:38:11,450
No,
so I'm laughing at them and waste all 

3476
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:11,450
your fucking money.
The plant is perfect as it is,

3477
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:14,550
as a perfect balance is it's.
It works as it is,

3478
02:38:14,551 --> 02:38:19,551
so,
but they can't trademark you trademark 

3479
02:38:19,551 --> 02:38:19,551
it,
so you want to change it a little bit to

3480
02:38:19,551 --> 02:38:21,180
create something can trademark and make 
tons of profit off.

3481
02:38:21,181 --> 02:38:23,550
But guess what?
Because it ain't working.

3482
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:24,720
Yeah.
Once you.

3483
02:38:24,750 --> 02:38:26,850
Once you change it,
it doesn't work the way it's supposed to

3484
02:38:26,851 --> 02:38:27,090
work.

3485
02:38:27,650 --> 02:38:30,020
It's all people trying to control shit.
You know,

3486
02:38:30,021 --> 02:38:34,370
it's people that are trying to control 
how much agriculture you could sell.

3487
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:39,600
I mean that's what it is.
It's agriculture with marijuana really 

3488
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:42,491
is a psychoactive agriculture.
It's plants like the idea that you tell 

3489
02:38:42,491 --> 02:38:43,000
someone they can't grow tomatoes

3490
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:45,260
in their backyard.
It's fucking bananas close.

3491
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:49,280
It's a plant that grows from the ground 
exactly as it is.

3492
02:38:49,490 --> 02:38:51,560
God fucking made plant grows from the 
ground.

3493
02:38:51,561 --> 02:38:52,820
How?
How can that be illegal?

3494
02:38:52,910 --> 02:38:53,080
Right?

3495
02:38:53,110 --> 02:38:55,180
So if you have tomatoes in your 
backyard,

3496
02:38:55,181 --> 02:39:00,181
everyone knows tomatoes have lots of 
vitamins are healthy for you and you 

3497
02:39:00,181 --> 02:39:00,181
know one who would say,
oh,

3498
02:39:00,181 --> 02:39:00,370
you can't do that.

3499
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:04,580
I go to the Chinese have been using hubs
so thousands of years.

3500
02:39:04,581 --> 02:39:06,830
Sure.
Marijuana is just the same thing.

3501
02:39:06,831 --> 02:39:08,060
It's just,
it's the mother of all

3502
02:39:08,460 --> 02:39:10,620
the fucking top,
uh,

3503
02:39:10,930 --> 02:39:15,930
you know,
sometimes people get confused about 

3504
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:15,930
like,
Oh,

3505
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:15,930
you know,
you're supposed to be healthy.

3506
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:17,070
Is supposed to be an athlete.
What'd you doing?

3507
02:39:17,071 --> 02:39:18,930
Smoking marijuana.
I'm like,

3508
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:21,690
this is the fucking healthiest thing I 
do every day.

3509
02:39:21,930 --> 02:39:23,920
I got like 40 tablets here.
Yeah,

3510
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:25,870
I got fischels.
They got vitamin C,

3511
02:39:25,890 --> 02:39:28,440
got resveratrol,
I got her herbs,

3512
02:39:28,740 --> 02:39:31,150
I got everything in know.
Well,

3513
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:36,200
guess what?
More powerful than all those fucking 

3514
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:38,481
things together,
although they're beneficial is my 

3515
02:39:38,481 --> 02:39:38,481
cannabis oil I take every day.
This is like,

3516
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:41,790
I don't know if you're familiar with a 
guy called Bob Melamede.

3517
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:43,930
Dr Bob Melamede,
his,

3518
02:39:44,010 --> 02:39:49,010
uh,
studies a free radical is a human 

3519
02:39:49,010 --> 02:39:49,010
biologist,
I think.

3520
02:39:49,770 --> 02:39:53,700
And he states that a cannabis is the 
most powerful antioxidant,

3521
02:39:53,701 --> 02:39:56,610
most powerful anti aging substance on 
the planet.

3522
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:59,010
Period.
That's it.

3523
02:40:00,090 --> 02:40:05,090
So I,
I consider it a health supplement and 

3524
02:40:05,090 --> 02:40:05,090
yeah,
I get high enough.

3525
02:40:05,090 --> 02:40:08,730
It's a health club too.
And there's also ways you could take 

3526
02:40:08,730 --> 02:40:08,730
that are non psychoactive.
You know,

3527
02:40:08,730 --> 02:40:09,980
people that take cbds or I take this 
stuff.

3528
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:11,820
Charlotte's web,
hemp oil.

3529
02:40:11,850 --> 02:40:13,810
Take this everyday.
That's a high cbd.

3530
02:40:13,811 --> 02:40:13,960
It's

3531
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,020
fantastic.
That makes you feel good.

3532
02:40:16,021 --> 02:40:19,170
It alleviates aches and pains is good 
for anxiety.

3533
02:40:19,171 --> 02:40:22,380
It's good for mental clarity.
It's just great for your body.

3534
02:40:22,381 --> 02:40:25,020
It's just some.
It's an essential oil for your body.

3535
02:40:25,150 --> 02:40:29,320
I got my left knee.
The cartilage is gone.

3536
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:31,200
Uh,
the shoulders,

3537
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:36,260
you know,
not only the supraspinous that's gone 

3538
02:40:36,260 --> 02:40:36,260
the,
you know,

3539
02:40:36,260 --> 02:40:36,760
when I go for a scan,
they're like,

3540
02:40:36,790 --> 02:40:39,520
oh,
didn't know you had your shoulder is the

3541
02:40:39,521 --> 02:40:42,010
arthritis is really bad.
You must spend a ton of pain.

3542
02:40:42,011 --> 02:40:43,480
I'm like,
nothing.

3543
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:48,960
I don't have any pain.
I don't know if that's down to my kind 

3544
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:48,960
of issues,
but it definitely,

3545
02:40:49,390 --> 02:40:50,890
definitely a factor in the,
you know,

3546
02:40:51,310 --> 02:40:56,310
I'm sure it's a factor.
Do you think also a factor is mental 

3547
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:59,131
toughness because of the fact that you,
your understanding of pain is probably 

3548
02:40:59,131 --> 02:40:59,131
way different than that.

3549
02:40:59,131 --> 02:41:00,850
How you perceive pain,
you know,

3550
02:41:00,851 --> 02:41:04,570
like you're not going to dwell on it the
way that advertising is not a big deal.

3551
02:41:04,580 --> 02:41:06,380
I'm,
I live with that every day from,

3552
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:11,410
from training,
and actually look forward to it in a 

3553
02:41:11,410 --> 02:41:11,410
way.
Yeah.

3554
02:41:11,410 --> 02:41:11,710
So probably my perception of pain is 
like,

3555
02:41:12,470 --> 02:41:14,800
is less than everybody else's,
but for sure,

3556
02:41:14,940 --> 02:41:16,000
you know,
when I'm asleep,

3557
02:41:16,001 --> 02:41:18,040
if you had to reel arthritis,
I mean it's going to wait.

3558
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:19,600
You're going to get paid.
I don't get anything.

3559
02:41:19,630 --> 02:41:23,060
So something I'm doing is helping.
Um,

3560
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:25,210
yeah.
I consider cannabis to,

3561
02:41:25,211 --> 02:41:27,610
they'd be the most powerful health 
supplement you can take.

3562
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:33,540
I'm better than all the other stuff,
but I still take all the other stuff as 

3563
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,720
well because I'm stuck in all the odds 
in my favor,

3564
02:41:34,721 --> 02:41:34,980
you know?

3565
02:41:35,270 --> 02:41:40,270
Yeah.
I mean I think it's really important 

3566
02:41:40,270 --> 02:41:41,020
guys like you that are going against the
grain explaining your position and,

3567
02:41:41,050 --> 02:41:46,050
and also you as a respected professional
athlete where people will listen to you 

3568
02:41:46,461 --> 02:41:46,940
and they go,
oh,

3569
02:41:46,941 --> 02:41:51,941
well this guy is such a straight shooter
about steroids and about training and 

3570
02:41:51,941 --> 02:41:52,580
about injuries and all these other 
things.

3571
02:41:52,970 --> 02:41:54,260
He's not going to lie about this.

3572
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:59,400
Well,
the people have just been had this 

3573
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:01,440
misinformation for so long,
so strong in that brain is like,

3574
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:04,870
it's hard to change.
So a change that you know,

3575
02:42:04,871 --> 02:42:07,060
especially if you don't have any 
experience with a soft,

3576
02:42:07,090 --> 02:42:12,090
like this fucking drug.
Like I dunno if somebody put on the 

3577
02:42:12,090 --> 02:42:13,870
instagram,
I can't believe you ate smokes weed.

3578
02:42:13,960 --> 02:42:16,270
I just fucking hate lazy stoners.

3579
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:22,680
That's a pretty strong reaction man.
Like you hate somebody because they're 

3580
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:27,041
smoking a fucking lazy calling you lazy.
It's hilarious.

3581
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:33,400
It's like an ally that I need to smoke 
weed to stop me from doing too much 

3582
02:42:33,400 --> 02:42:35,170
fucking.
This is a slow me down.

3583
02:42:35,190 --> 02:42:38,130
So like a normal level.
Why listen yet

3584
02:42:38,220 --> 02:42:43,220
it,
it can fucking slow you down and you 

3585
02:42:43,220 --> 02:42:46,000
know,
you can sit and smoke fucking weed all 

3586
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,900
day and sitting in the couch and watch 
TV and eat pizzas if you want like you 

3587
02:42:47,900 --> 02:42:51,000
know,
but if you're smart you use it when it's

3588
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:52,830
the time to use it.
And I like,

3589
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:58,000
uh,
sometimes I like to smoke a little bit 

3590
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,480
of cardio because it opens my broncos 
and I get a better fucking will count or

3591
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:05,550
it's generally in the evening when I'm 
relaxing or if I want to do something 

3592
02:43:05,550 --> 02:43:08,460
creative like I'm writing or something.
It helps me like think a little bit,

3593
02:43:08,730 --> 02:43:13,730
um,
but there will be times when it's 

3594
02:43:13,730 --> 02:43:13,730
appropriate and times when it's not

3595
02:43:13,730 --> 02:43:13,850
appropriate and that's it,
you know?

3596
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:15,730
No,
I completely agree.

3597
02:43:15,970 --> 02:43:20,970
I just think that it's a lot like what 
we're talking about earlier with fats 

3598
02:43:20,970 --> 02:43:24,391
and sugar,
that there's this misinformation that 

3599
02:43:24,391 --> 02:43:27,241
continues forever.
It's like once you get an idea in your 

3600
02:43:27,241 --> 02:43:27,241
head,
oh,

3601
02:43:27,241 --> 02:43:28,300
low fat is good,
high fat is bad,

3602
02:43:28,480 --> 02:43:31,720
and then somewhere along the line you 
realize that that's bullshit.

3603
02:43:31,721 --> 02:43:34,540
Like what you might realize that you 
might do the research,

3604
02:43:34,541 --> 02:43:37,150
you might go into the article and then 
look at the studies and go,

3605
02:43:37,151 --> 02:43:38,230
wow,
this is insane.

3606
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:43,231
And how did this happen?
And go into the New York Times article 

3607
02:43:43,231 --> 02:43:43,231
about the sugar industry,
bing.

3608
02:43:43,231 --> 02:43:45,370
But once you get to a certain point in 
time,

3609
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:50,320
you realize like most people are not 
going to do all this.

3610
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:52,310
They're not going to look into this.
They're not going to get.

3611
02:43:52,330 --> 02:43:57,330
So most people are going to hear what 
they heard when they were little 

3612
02:43:57,330 --> 02:43:58,840
marijuana is for losers.
Marijuana makes you lazy.

3613
02:43:59,050 --> 02:44:04,050
You're going to be a lazy stoner.
I don't want to be that marijuana is 

3614
02:44:04,050 --> 02:44:04,050
bad.
Like jeff sessions,

3615
02:44:04,050 --> 02:44:08,700
the fucking guys on record saying,
good people do not smoke marijuana.

3616
02:44:09,730 --> 02:44:11,650
Dude.
You're talking about millions of people.

3617
02:44:11,651 --> 02:44:13,210
You're saying none of them are good 
people

3618
02:44:13,590 --> 02:44:14,280
generally.
Is it?

3619
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:18,280
That is a thing of the people that smoke
marijuana are generally nicer.

3620
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:23,600
Kind of more thoughtful people and 
realize that in some way we're all 

3621
02:44:24,671 --> 02:44:25,600
connected.
We're all,

3622
02:44:25,810 --> 02:44:30,590
we're not fucking independent,
so how's that better

3623
02:44:30,890 --> 02:44:32,180
thing?
Because he doesn't smoke pot.

3624
02:44:32,210 --> 02:44:33,270
That's the problem.
Oh,

3625
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:35,480
we need to fucking hold him down and 
make him smoke pot.

3626
02:44:35,660 --> 02:44:37,490
That's what we need to do.
But he'll freak out.

3627
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:43,120
Apparently Joey Diaz gave pauly shore 
some stars of death on his podcast and 

3628
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:44,270
now polly won't release the podcast.
He's like,

3629
02:44:44,271 --> 02:44:45,260
hide it,
burn it,

3630
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:47,180
burn it with fire,
kill it,

3631
02:44:47,900 --> 02:44:48,890
kill it like a demon.

3632
02:44:49,730 --> 02:44:54,730
I mean,
cannabis is so good that when you smoke 

3633
02:44:54,730 --> 02:44:59,411
it,
which is full of fucking tall and 

3634
02:44:59,411 --> 02:45:00,080
costage ins and everything in smoke into
your lungs,

3635
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:01,580
it doesn't even damage your lungs.

3636
02:45:02,090 --> 02:45:07,090
Yeah.
I think it's supposed to be a different 

3637
02:45:07,090 --> 02:45:07,090
type of smoke though,
like the smoke that you get,

3638
02:45:07,090 --> 02:45:09,050
it's probably harsh,
but it doesn't have the same,

3639
02:45:09,470 --> 02:45:11,510
but the properties of it don't have the 
same.

3640
02:45:11,650 --> 02:45:16,650
Like the,
the issue apparently with tobacco in 

3641
02:45:16,650 --> 02:45:16,650
particular,
like just regular tobacco.

3642
02:45:16,650 --> 02:45:21,071
If you're smoking,
a regular rolled cigarette of hand 

3643
02:45:21,071 --> 02:45:21,170
rolled tobacco,
just pure tobacco.

3644
02:45:21,180 --> 02:45:22,280
No,
no.

3645
02:45:22,281 --> 02:45:25,700
Uh,
other bullshit ingredients is not as bad

3646
02:45:25,701 --> 02:45:27,920
for you as a cigarette,
but still bad.

3647
02:45:27,950 --> 02:45:31,520
I've got a ton of chemicals in this.
Hundreds of chemicals by the way,

3648
02:45:31,521 --> 02:45:33,320
approved by our government.
They're like,

3649
02:45:33,321 --> 02:45:34,480
yeah,
pour it in there.

3650
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:36,430
It's good.
It must be good,

3651
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:41,440
man.
It's going to get people to throw it in 

3652
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:41,440
there.

3653
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:42,910
Government govern what government's 
meant is your mind.

3654
02:45:43,010 --> 02:45:48,010
But marijuana smoke has been shown to be
an expectorant actually can clear the 

3655
02:45:48,010 --> 02:45:49,440
lungs of certain issues.
It

3656
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:54,160
highlights the Broncos as opposed to the
backhoe is closing them all the time.

3657
02:45:54,690 --> 02:45:59,690
Um,
I don't know if you're familiar with a 

3658
02:45:59,690 --> 02:46:01,531
study that was done here at Ucla.
I believe a guy called Donald Tuscan.

3659
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:05,440
He did it over 20 years.
It was a properly funded study.

3660
02:46:06,330 --> 02:46:11,330
While I was at properly funded,
because it was funded to look for 

3661
02:46:11,330 --> 02:46:14,081
negative results,
so the purpose of this study was to 

3662
02:46:14,081 --> 02:46:16,340
prove that smoking cannabis damages your
lungs just like cigarettes,

3663
02:46:16,341 --> 02:46:21,341
right?
So the followed three groups over 20 

3664
02:46:21,341 --> 02:46:23,831
years,
cigarette smokers only or tobacco 

3665
02:46:23,831 --> 02:46:27,790
tobacco and marijuana together and 
marijuana only and to tobacco smokers 

3666
02:46:28,221 --> 02:46:29,900
over 20 years,
of course,

3667
02:46:30,050 --> 02:46:32,630
loss of lung function,
a lot of cancers,

3668
02:46:32,631 --> 02:46:37,631
all the stuff we already know.
The middle group was way less and the 

3669
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:43,150
marijuana group smoker,
like daily smoking over 20 years was no 

3670
02:46:44,121 --> 02:46:47,600
increased cancer.
There was no loss of lung function,

3671
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:53,230
in fact,
that had a slight increase in lung 

3672
02:46:53,230 --> 02:46:54,920
function as compared to nonsmokers

3673
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:59,110
other exercise and taking big tokes.
That's what he gets

3674
02:46:59,220 --> 02:47:01,500
because you're taking in,
but not only that,

3675
02:47:01,980 --> 02:47:05,100
because the cannabis is dilating the 
broncos all the time.

3676
02:47:05,101 --> 02:47:07,320
If you keep dialing and keep dialing and
keep dialing,

3677
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:12,340
it's going to get more.
You know it's going to get more 

3678
02:47:12,340 --> 02:47:12,340
functional.
Well,

3679
02:47:12,340 --> 02:47:15,831
it makes sense.
I mean just it's counterintuitive to a 

3680
02:47:15,831 --> 02:47:15,831
lot of people that think that's 
negative.

3681
02:47:15,831 --> 02:47:20,140
It's bad for you.
So I just see it as a super health 

3682
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:20,140
supplement.
I don't see anything negative.

3683
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:23,670
I don't see it as a drug.
Just the plant and yeah,

3684
02:47:23,910 --> 02:47:26,250
you get high and you feel good.
So what's in your life?

3685
02:47:26,251 --> 02:47:29,820
It's silly shit.
Good for you.

3686
02:47:29,821 --> 02:47:30,060
Right?

3687
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:35,640
I agree.
And I think that people are starting to 

3688
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:35,640
understand that more now than when we 
were kids for sure.

3689
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:40,480
Yeah.
I used to smoke when I was a teenager 

3690
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:40,480
and in England we mix it with tobacco or
this,

3691
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:42,500
just until I came here.
I don't know,

3692
02:47:42,501 --> 02:47:46,460
like people smoke it pure.
I don't mix with tobacco now because I'm

3693
02:47:46,461 --> 02:47:48,800
realizing the weed is good and tobacco 
is bad.

3694
02:47:48,801 --> 02:47:53,801
Before I didn't know both.
Probably bad for you and I'll give a 

3695
02:47:53,801 --> 02:47:53,801
shit,
you know?

3696
02:47:53,801 --> 02:47:54,130
Yeah.
How did that get started in England?

3697
02:47:54,131 --> 02:47:55,420
Because every time had been over 
England.

3698
02:47:55,630 --> 02:47:56,490
They do that too.
They're like,

3699
02:47:56,500 --> 02:47:57,940
do you make sure we'd.
With tobacco it's was like,

3700
02:47:57,941 --> 02:47:58,840
what?
Yeah,

3701
02:47:58,841 --> 02:48:00,190
I don't know man.
That was like,

3702
02:48:00,460 --> 02:48:02,860
that's how it was always done that way 
when I grew up.

3703
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:07,960
Um,
I grew up in Birmingham as a ton of 

3704
02:48:07,960 --> 02:48:07,960
Jamaicans,
you know,

3705
02:48:07,960 --> 02:48:10,330
so the Jamaicans were the guys that 
brought the weed and,

3706
02:48:10,331 --> 02:48:15,331
and stuff like that,
but even they used to mix with tobacco 

3707
02:48:15,331 --> 02:48:15,790
and a lot of people smoke cash.
So how she got to,

3708
02:48:15,970 --> 02:48:17,130
you got to Mexico,
you know,

3709
02:48:17,150 --> 02:48:17,890
with something.
Right.

3710
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:22,920
So people mentioned it with tobacco,
but I think last time I smoked tobacco 

3711
02:48:22,920 --> 02:48:27,370
was probably like eight,
nine years ago when I became educated 

3712
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:27,370
and I was like,
wow,

3713
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:28,690
this cannabis is really good on its own.

3714
02:48:28,870 --> 02:48:31,480
A lot of people in America,
they take a cigar,

3715
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:33,850
they take out the,
the tobacco.

3716
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:36,220
Yeah.
And they make a blunt out of it.

3717
02:48:36,221 --> 02:48:40,770
But you're taking in tobacco and belief 
and he gives you this weird high.

3718
02:48:40,910 --> 02:48:45,910
Yeah,
because you're getting that nicotine 

3719
02:48:45,910 --> 02:48:45,910
buzz,
like a head buzz,

3720
02:48:45,910 --> 02:48:48,530
but you're also inhaling in a way that 
you don't do with cigars.

3721
02:48:49,130 --> 02:48:51,320
You don't.
Usually you puff it out,

3722
02:48:51,321 --> 02:48:51,590
right?
Yeah.

3723
02:48:51,591 --> 02:48:53,100
You,
you get the tobacco,

3724
02:48:53,101 --> 02:48:58,101
it gets into your body from your mouth,
but you don't really inhale deep into 

3725
02:48:58,101 --> 02:48:58,101
the.
I like to use it,

3726
02:48:58,101 --> 02:48:58,110
the

3727
02:48:58,150 --> 02:49:02,010
hemp papers and also I vaporize extract 
as well.

3728
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:04,080
Yeah,
like dabbing Nicole here.

3729
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:06,450
Um,
so I do that.

3730
02:49:06,510 --> 02:49:07,690
I find,
I don't know,

3731
02:49:07,691 --> 02:49:12,691
I find it a bit different between 
smoking weed and Dab in the extract 

3732
02:49:12,691 --> 02:49:14,700
smoking weed.
I find it a bit more relaxing.

3733
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:20,030
Dabbing the extract is like,
I'll do that before I go on a bike ride 

3734
02:49:20,030 --> 02:49:20,030
or

3735
02:49:20,030 --> 02:49:20,030
cardio or something.
And I'm like,

3736
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:25,010
man,
they don't get tired,

3737
02:49:25,640 --> 02:49:26,840
don't get tired.
I know,

3738
02:49:26,841 --> 02:49:28,130
right.
Isn't it amazing?

3739
02:49:28,250 --> 02:49:29,270
Uh,
you can,

3740
02:49:29,330 --> 02:49:30,830
you know,
whatever you do in running.

3741
02:49:31,460 --> 02:49:36,460
First of all it's,
it's dilating your bronco so you can 

3742
02:49:36,460 --> 02:49:39,011
deliver more oxygen.
But I think also it's the mental thing 

3743
02:49:39,011 --> 02:49:42,131
they like get in that zone and perceived
pain is less.

3744
02:49:42,770 --> 02:49:45,020
Discomfort is less.
So you just keep,

3745
02:49:45,230 --> 02:49:46,590
just keep going.
Yeah.

3746
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:47,870
Um,
yeah.

3747
02:49:47,900 --> 02:49:52,900
One of the guys in Brazil,
like all smoke before the do Jujitsu 

3748
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:52,900
because it helps to be relaxed,
right?

3749
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:53,570
When you're doing that,
you know,

3750
02:49:53,571 --> 02:49:54,890
want to be all tense all the time.

3751
02:49:54,920 --> 02:49:57,830
Not just relaxed but also singularly 
focused.

3752
02:49:57,940 --> 02:49:58,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

3753
02:49:58,730 --> 02:50:02,690
It's America to giant percentage of 
people smoke pot for the Jujitsu.

3754
02:50:02,710 --> 02:50:03,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

3755
02:50:03,860 --> 02:50:04,880
It's a big,
big thing.

3756
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:10,100
Bought bodybuilding as well.
Really mean I'm the only one that talks 

3757
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:10,100
about it because all those guys are like
scared,

3758
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:14,970
like uh,
it's going to be viewed negatively or 

3759
02:50:14,970 --> 02:50:15,580
their sponsors are gonna like,
you know,

3760
02:50:15,610 --> 02:50:17,500
drop them or something like that.
Yeah.

3761
02:50:18,230 --> 02:50:20,740
Well I can tell you like half the guys 
on the Olympic stage,

3762
02:50:20,741 --> 02:50:24,880
they'll stone us because it helps you 
relax after training.

3763
02:50:24,910 --> 02:50:26,170
You can't drink.
Right.

3764
02:50:26,470 --> 02:50:31,470
You know,
because the calories and if you're 

3765
02:50:31,470 --> 02:50:31,470
drinking the next day you're not going 
to perform so well.

3766
02:50:31,470 --> 02:50:35,761
I mean you can get totally fucking high 
tonight and you can go in a gym tomorrow

3767
02:50:35,861 --> 02:50:40,861
morning.
One hundred percent have a negative 

3768
02:50:40,861 --> 02:50:40,861
effect.
Right?

3769
02:50:40,861 --> 02:50:40,861
Zero.

3770
02:50:40,861 --> 02:50:41,380
Do you remember the Arnold?
I'm sure you do.

3771
02:50:41,381 --> 02:50:46,000
Arnold is numero uno token on a little 
one though.

3772
02:50:46,150 --> 02:50:48,490
I mean that was.
People were like,

3773
02:50:48,520 --> 02:50:52,630
what is he doing back then it was almost
like he was getting drunk or something.

3774
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:57,680
Yeah.
People didn't even think about it and he

3775
02:50:57,681 --> 02:50:58,880
was the only one.
It wasn't.

3776
02:50:58,910 --> 02:51:01,340
He wasn't passing it around other 
people.

3777
02:51:01,341 --> 02:51:03,530
He was the only one on camera smoking.
Yeah,

3778
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:08,590
they look guys,
we'll probably schedule on the smoke on 

3779
02:51:08,590 --> 02:51:08,590
camera,
you know?

3780
02:51:08,590 --> 02:51:08,590
Yeah.
Well,

3781
02:51:08,970 --> 02:51:10,700
it's still viewed negatively,
you know,

3782
02:51:10,701 --> 02:51:11,470
like,
uh,

3783
02:51:11,810 --> 02:51:16,810
an athlete say he smokes marijuana,
he's risking maybe losing is a 

3784
02:51:16,810 --> 02:51:19,660
sponsorship and uh,
uh,

3785
02:51:19,710 --> 02:51:21,180
I don't give a shit.
I don't have sponsors.

3786
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:22,610
I'm independent.
So you know,

3787
02:51:22,750 --> 02:51:24,710
a bit more free to speak out.

3788
02:51:25,180 --> 02:51:27,130
Well,
the crazy thing to me was the nfl,

3789
02:51:27,670 --> 02:51:32,670
the nfl saying that these guys can't 
smoke pot and they suspend them for 

3790
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:36,280
smoking pot.
Meanwhile it's okay to run full speed at

3791
02:51:36,281 --> 02:51:41,281
each other and smash into each other and
the massive amount of damage that's 

3792
02:51:41,281 --> 02:51:42,010
doing,
that's,

3793
02:51:42,370 --> 02:51:44,260
that's not,
that's not a problem,

3794
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:49,680
but the problem that would actually help
with brain injuries because a lot of 

3795
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:49,680
studies,

3796
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:52,020
you know,
with Alzheimer's and stuff like that,

3797
02:51:52,130 --> 02:51:56,190
that's very protective on the brain.
So maybe it could have helped them.

3798
02:51:56,200 --> 02:51:57,810
If anything I would definitely wouldn't 
hurt.

3799
02:51:57,811 --> 02:51:57,830
No

3800
02:51:57,890 --> 02:52:00,020
harm them.
And even if it's just cbd oil,

3801
02:52:00,021 --> 02:52:03,890
it's a neuroprotectant canabinoids yeah.
Yeah.

3802
02:52:03,891 --> 02:52:04,730
It's,
I mean,

3803
02:52:04,731 --> 02:52:09,731
we living in an age where information is
leaking out there and people understand 

3804
02:52:09,731 --> 02:52:14,461
things more today than they ever did 
before where there's still a massive 

3805
02:52:14,461 --> 02:52:14,461
amount of ignorance that you have to 
combat,

3806
02:52:14,461 --> 02:52:14,820
but it's,
you know,

3807
02:52:15,400 --> 02:52:17,530
it's a head of 10 years ago.
Yeah,

3808
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:18,070
right.
And,

3809
02:52:18,071 --> 02:52:19,840
uh,
I live in Europe,

3810
02:52:19,860 --> 02:52:24,730
although I live in Spain now and in 
Spain it's not legal,

3811
02:52:25,390 --> 02:52:26,500
but it's,
um,

3812
02:52:26,860 --> 02:52:31,860
it's legal to grow in your house for 
your own use is legal to smoke in your 

3813
02:52:32,171 --> 02:52:34,330
house for your own use.
So what's happened is,

3814
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:37,420
um,
these collectors are being created,

3815
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:39,580
so,
all right,

3816
02:52:39,581 --> 02:52:43,240
so I can smoke in my own private 
residence and I can grow whatever,

3817
02:52:43,330 --> 02:52:45,450
let's say three plants for myself.
I'll get bullied.

3818
02:52:45,970 --> 02:52:48,820
So what if there's 100 of us now in this
collective,

3819
02:52:48,821 --> 02:52:51,580
in this club.
So now we can grow 300 plants.

3820
02:52:51,581 --> 02:52:56,581
And so that's how it is.
It's supposed to be nonprofit 

3821
02:52:56,581 --> 02:52:56,581
organizations.
Um,

3822
02:52:56,581 --> 02:52:59,440
so when you go and you buy your weed,
you're not technically buying a weed,

3823
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:02,980
you're contributing to the upkeep of the
collective.

3824
02:53:03,220 --> 02:53:03,940
That makes sense.

3825
02:53:03,970 --> 02:53:05,300
So that's how it works.
Uh,

3826
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:09,100
and then uh,
in Holland it's um,

3827
02:53:10,180 --> 02:53:14,590
tolerated they call it technically is 
not legal is tolerated,

3828
02:53:14,591 --> 02:53:17,330
so the console in the coffee shops there
and whatever,

3829
02:53:17,360 --> 02:53:22,360
and Amsterdam,
so those two countries a little bit 

3830
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:25,651
ahead,
but everywhere else is still still not 

3831
02:53:25,651 --> 02:53:25,651
legal.
Like in UK where I come from,

3832
02:53:25,651 --> 02:53:30,330
it's not legal,
but the police have already stated then 

3833
02:53:30,330 --> 02:53:34,700
going to arrest people for smoking weed 
because they're considered a waste of 

3834
02:53:34,700 --> 02:53:35,380
their time.
Um,

3835
02:53:35,470 --> 02:53:38,470
so any major city in England,
you go walk down the street,

3836
02:53:38,471 --> 02:53:43,471
you can smell weed.
People just walk down the street and 

3837
02:53:43,471 --> 02:53:43,471
smoking weed.
If the police are there,

3838
02:53:43,471 --> 02:53:43,471
they might say,
hey,

3839
02:53:43,540 --> 02:53:44,140
you know,
come on,

3840
02:53:44,170 --> 02:53:46,960
put that out.
But that's as far as it goes.

3841
02:53:46,961 --> 02:53:49,300
So technically it's still illegal,
but it's kind of like,

3842
02:53:50,020 --> 02:53:51,700
you know,
the police are not,

3843
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:53,410
they don't care about it unless you're 
selling it.

3844
02:53:53,750 --> 02:53:58,750
I think Canada is set to essentially 
legalize it nationwide and think that's 

3845
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:03,940
the most recent revelation from Canada.
They're essentially ready to just kind 

3846
02:54:04,271 --> 02:54:06,200
of has always been a pretty good weed 
country.

3847
02:54:06,201 --> 02:54:06,860
Right?
Yeah.

3848
02:54:06,890 --> 02:54:08,300
Well,
the Vancouver in particular,

3849
02:54:08,600 --> 02:54:13,600
there's a great documentary about the 
marijuana industry and it's impact on 

3850
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:17,231
Vancouver.
It's called the union fantastic 

3851
02:54:17,231 --> 02:54:19,901
documentary.
Just showing how ridiculous it is and 

3852
02:54:19,901 --> 02:54:22,721
how inexorably tied marijuana is to 
their entire economy in Vancouver.

3853
02:54:22,850 --> 02:54:23,240
I mean,
it's,

3854
02:54:23,780 --> 02:54:28,780
the money that comes in from marijuana 
is just a gigantic portion of their 

3855
02:54:28,780 --> 02:54:29,340
economy and it's all this.

3856
02:54:29,730 --> 02:54:34,700
So that's why Colorado setting such an 
example of making so much money,

3857
02:54:34,701 --> 02:54:39,701
like we got to be other states looking 
at it like a think fucking Detroit 

3858
02:54:39,701 --> 02:54:40,670
should get on that.

3859
02:54:40,700 --> 02:54:42,170
Trying to fuck.
Yeah.

3860
02:54:42,290 --> 02:54:43,580
Yeah.
Detroit's a mess.

3861
02:54:43,581 --> 02:54:45,260
Right.
And coming back with like,

3862
02:54:45,261 --> 02:54:46,940
um,
handmade stuff,

3863
02:54:46,941 --> 02:54:51,941
there's a bunch of things like different
industries and different small 

3864
02:54:52,221 --> 02:54:55,280
businesses are starting to emerge in 
Detroit that are kind of very,

3865
02:54:55,340 --> 02:54:57,260
very promising.
But yeah,

3866
02:54:57,261 --> 02:54:58,550
that would be a huge factor.

3867
02:54:58,980 --> 02:55:00,820
Now there's a huge industry out there,
uh,

3868
02:55:01,150 --> 02:55:03,070
not just grow in the,
all the other.

3869
02:55:03,230 --> 02:55:05,870
I come here and it's like I'm a kid in a
candy shop.

3870
02:55:05,900 --> 02:55:10,900
You know,
you got chocolate and it's like tells 

3871
02:55:10,900 --> 02:55:13,970
you how much thc is in each square.
We've got breast brave man,

3872
02:55:14,810 --> 02:55:16,760
you got butter,
you've got cakes,

3873
02:55:16,761 --> 02:55:18,500
you've got everything man,
and I'm like,

3874
02:55:18,730 --> 02:55:21,050
yeah,
you're careful with those cakes though.

3875
02:55:21,380 --> 02:55:22,010
Yeah,
well,

3876
02:55:22,011 --> 02:55:23,690
edibles.
I always tell people,

3877
02:55:23,691 --> 02:55:28,691
be careful with edibles because if 
you're smoking a joint and you take a 

3878
02:55:28,691 --> 02:55:32,471
couple of puffs,
it's going to hit you pretty much 

3879
02:55:32,471 --> 02:55:33,380
immediately to your brain,
so you're going to feel it and you're to

3880
02:55:33,390 --> 02:55:38,390
decide whether you want to smoke some 
more on that or maybe you want to just 

3881
02:55:38,390 --> 02:55:40,400
put it down right and chill,
but when you eat it,

3882
02:55:40,980 --> 02:55:42,860
it's going to take 45 minutes to an 
hour,

3883
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:44,630
so hit your system and you don't know 
what,

3884
02:55:45,620 --> 02:55:48,740
how strong that's going to be and if 
it's too strong,

3885
02:55:48,741 --> 02:55:49,970
which most of the time it is.

3886
02:55:49,970 --> 02:55:54,970
If you're not experienced then you're on
that fucking ride and you can't get off 

3887
02:55:56,360 --> 02:55:59,990
hours and it can be pretty unpleasant,
mean like too much thc.

3888
02:55:59,991 --> 02:56:04,991
For somebody that's not used to it,
you can feel very paranoid and very 

3889
02:56:04,991 --> 02:56:06,110
uncomfortable.
You can feel nausea,

3890
02:56:06,111 --> 02:56:09,800
she might vomit.
You're going to get low blood sugar a.

3891
02:56:09,801 --> 02:56:14,801
all this stuff is not going to be a nice
experience and probably then you're 

3892
02:56:14,801 --> 02:56:14,840
going to have a negative view of 
cannabis.

3893
02:56:14,841 --> 02:56:15,740
Like,
fuck that shit.

3894
02:56:15,741 --> 02:56:19,140
I'm not going anywhere near that again.
Um,

3895
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:24,250
so unless you're experienced,
I would just say stay away from edibles 

3896
02:56:24,250 --> 02:56:25,820
or like just have a small piece and wait
a fucking hour.

3897
02:56:25,821 --> 02:56:27,500
Don't,
don't be tempted to like,

3898
02:56:27,650 --> 02:56:28,670
oh,
I don't feel anything.

3899
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:31,460
I'll take another one,
then you're going to be fucked.

3900
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:34,580
That's great advice.
Go stepped gingerly.

3901
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:36,050
Yeah,
go very slowly.

3902
02:56:36,051 --> 02:56:38,810
And the edibles because it takes time to
digest it.

3903
02:56:38,810 --> 02:56:41,330
Time to get into the bloodstream and 
time to feel it.

3904
02:56:41,480 --> 02:56:45,500
So most people will eat some and say,
I don't feel anything.

3905
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,170
I don't have another one.
And then,

3906
02:56:48,110 --> 02:56:48,810
you know,
it's,

3907
02:56:49,190 --> 02:56:52,220
I've seen it happen so many times that 
it's too late.

3908
02:56:52,360 --> 02:56:57,360
Yeah.
And it's not going to be over in five 

3909
02:56:57,360 --> 02:56:57,360
minutes.
You're going to have hours of that.

3910
02:56:57,360 --> 02:56:57,360
Like,
you know,

3911
02:56:57,360 --> 02:57:00,500
and then they just to say that's,
that's kind of stuff is bad as you know.

3912
02:57:00,510 --> 02:57:01,910
It's horrible.
It's fine.

3913
02:57:01,940 --> 02:57:04,610
That's the beautiful thing.
Even after a horrendous,

3914
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:09,640
terrifying,
nothing bad can happen to you 

3915
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:12,400
physically,
you might vomit as like the worst thing 

3916
02:57:12,400 --> 02:57:13,160
that could happen,
but you got to be careful because I read

3917
02:57:13,161 --> 02:57:14,090
the other day,
right,

3918
02:57:14,780 --> 02:57:19,780
that uh,
there is a level at which cannabis can 

3919
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:23,531
kill you.
So you've got to be careful that you 

3920
02:57:23,531 --> 02:57:26,711
don't smoke 628 kilos cannabis in 15 
minutes because if you do that,

3921
02:57:28,521 --> 02:57:29,450
that could be toxic.

3922
02:57:29,450 --> 02:57:34,450
That could be lethal.
Someone out there is going to try to 

3923
02:57:34,450 --> 02:57:34,450
prove you wrong.
Yeah.

3924
02:57:34,450 --> 02:57:35,150
One point five fucking tons in 15 
minutes.

3925
02:57:35,151 --> 02:57:36,920
If you're going to hail that,
like good luck to you.

3926
02:57:37,010 --> 02:57:42,010
I think that's actually the ld 52,
which means liesel lethal dose for 50 

3927
02:57:42,010 --> 02:57:44,570
percent of the population.
Fifty percent of the population are most

3928
02:57:44,571 --> 02:57:49,571
definitely pussies survive that anyway.
I mean I couldn't smoke a fucking,

3929
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:53,720
I dunno in 15 minutes.
How much could you smoke?

3930
02:57:53,721 --> 02:57:55,850
Like five grams or something.
Like,

3931
02:57:56,420 --> 02:57:57,070
I don't know,
in the.

3932
02:57:57,400 --> 02:58:02,400
You could do more than that,
but in a vaporizer you can get pretty 

3933
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:02,400
deep.
But yeah,

3934
02:58:02,400 --> 02:58:03,870
you're not going to get anywhere near 
620.

3935
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:08,880
I don't know why that came at 628.
Six hundred and 27 or 600.

3936
02:58:09,331 --> 02:58:10,260
Twenty nine.
I Dunno,

3937
02:58:10,410 --> 02:58:13,020
it's theoretical anyway because no one's
ever died from it.

3938
02:58:13,060 --> 02:58:14,010
No one's ever died from it.

3939
02:58:14,010 --> 02:58:19,010
So like what other substance?
Kenya not die from it.

3940
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:22,020
Even water is you have too much water.
You drown.

3941
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:27,200
Right?
So I mean this is pretty harmless 

3942
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:27,200
fucking substance.
If there's no,

3943
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:29,320
there's no feasible toxic level.
Alright,

3944
02:58:29,400 --> 02:58:30,630
600,
28 kilos.

3945
02:58:30,631 --> 02:58:32,800
I'm taking the piss like,
you know,

3946
02:58:33,330 --> 02:58:36,330
I couldn't smoke that in my lifetime.
How often do you smoke pot?

3947
02:58:36,580 --> 02:58:39,240
Every day.
Damn Day man.

3948
02:58:39,241 --> 02:58:44,241
Gentlemen,
every day I take my vitamin C everyday 

3949
02:58:44,241 --> 02:58:44,241
as well.
Fish oil.

3950
02:58:44,241 --> 02:58:46,490
The rest of us are at all,
like all antioxidants.

3951
02:58:46,530 --> 02:58:48,630
I said daily thing man.
I might go,

3952
02:58:48,660 --> 02:58:53,660
I go sometimes with not smoking for a 
week or two just because I want to have 

3953
02:58:53,881 --> 02:58:56,070
the discipline to,
you know,

3954
02:58:56,220 --> 02:58:59,460
to say I don't need to do this everyday,
but I fucking luck to do it everyday.

3955
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:02,100
So why not,
you know,

3956
02:59:02,580 --> 02:59:04,540
I hear you man.
And we're not.

3957
02:59:04,550 --> 02:59:09,550
You know,
I don't get up in the morning and smoke 

3958
02:59:09,550 --> 02:59:09,690
when I got shit to do because it might 
not help me do that stuff,

3959
02:59:09,750 --> 02:59:12,350
but if I'm working out or if I'm going 
to lie on a beach,

3960
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:13,350
I'm going up the mountains.

3961
02:59:13,350 --> 02:59:14,430
Yeah.
I'll take a joint with me.

3962
02:59:14,431 --> 02:59:15,570
One.
Why not?

3963
02:59:16,340 --> 02:59:19,140
It just enhances everything.
You know,

3964
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:23,960
enhances you.
Your experience enhances food and sex.

3965
02:59:24,040 --> 02:59:26,880
Enhances music.
You're preaching to the choir,

3966
02:59:26,881 --> 02:59:27,590
man.
I know.

3967
02:59:27,650 --> 02:59:28,240
I know.
You know,

3968
02:59:28,690 --> 02:59:31,020
other people are listening.
I know what I'm saying.

3969
02:59:31,021 --> 02:59:32,880
I'm saying I'm with you.
Yeah.

3970
02:59:33,300 --> 02:59:33,990
No.
Uh,

3971
02:59:33,991 --> 02:59:35,910
I mean I couldn't agree more.
Listen man,

3972
02:59:35,911 --> 02:59:39,240
we just did three hours.
I crazy can went quick like that.

3973
02:59:39,780 --> 02:59:44,780
Yeah.
I wouldn't say that like an hour and a 

3974
02:59:44,780 --> 02:59:46,401
half or something.
Anything else to say to the people 

3975
02:59:46,401 --> 02:59:46,401
before we wrap this bitch up?
A.

3976
02:59:46,460 --> 02:59:49,680
I hate to be the guy that goes on.
Chet chosen promotes things,

3977
02:59:49,681 --> 02:59:52,230
but I'm going to have to do this.
Please do.

3978
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:57,440
Yeah.
Am going to be in Vegas on Saturday and 

3979
02:59:57,440 --> 02:59:57,930
we got a thing called swiftly the,
uh,

3980
02:59:58,260 --> 03:00:00,160
the date.
Actual date.

3981
03:00:00,161 --> 03:00:01,710
Saturday is 29.
Ninth.

3982
03:00:01,930 --> 03:00:02,150
Okay.

3983
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:07,180
I'm going to be in Vegas,
we've got a competition called Super 

3984
03:00:07,180 --> 03:00:11,090
League and this is for bodybuilders 
slash strength athletes and it's 

3985
03:00:11,611 --> 03:00:13,980
somewhat functional because,
you know,

3986
03:00:15,750 --> 03:00:19,650
you get a bodybuilder on stage and the 
general public look at that and say what

3987
03:00:19,651 --> 03:00:24,651
the fuck is this like strange and maybe 
a product of just taking drugs and they 

3988
03:00:24,651 --> 03:00:28,701
don't appreciate the work that goes into
that and how strong and athletic some of

3989
03:00:28,891 --> 03:00:31,860
these guys can be.
So this competition is,

3990
03:00:32,190 --> 03:00:34,560
has two rounds.
The first round is lifting,

3991
03:00:35,010 --> 03:00:40,010
so you get judged on eight different 
exercises you score a maximum of 12 reps

3992
03:00:40,171 --> 03:00:42,090
at.
So um,

3993
03:00:42,091 --> 03:00:44,550
there's that and then there's the 
physique round,

3994
03:00:44,910 --> 03:00:46,560
but it's,
it's done by computer,

3995
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:50,010
so it scans various areas of your body 
and gives you a score on that.

3996
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:57,140
Sounds a bit complex.
But if you want to go on superleague 

3997
03:00:57,140 --> 03:00:57,140
live,
it's got explain everything.

3998
03:00:57,140 --> 03:00:59,230
Have you been doing this for?
This is going to be the first one.

3999
03:00:59,360 --> 03:00:59,860
Ah,

4000
03:01:00,030 --> 03:01:05,030
and uh,
we weren't sure like what reaction we 

4001
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:07,500
get with the first one,
but it's been off the fucking hook and I

4002
03:01:07,501 --> 03:01:12,501
think we're going to get a new breed of 
athletes that are maybe not purely 

4003
03:01:12,501 --> 03:01:14,220
physique bodybuilders as like the Mr 
Olympia.

4004
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:16,480
We've got guys coming from power 
lifting,

4005
03:01:16,510 --> 03:01:21,510
we've got guys coming from bodybuilding,
there's a lot of guys out there in the 

4006
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:22,170
gyms around the world that are fucking 
athletic,

4007
03:01:22,171 --> 03:01:24,540
strong,
freaky guys and girls.

4008
03:01:24,690 --> 03:01:29,690
We've got both categories that maybe 
don't want to compete in a bodybuilding 

4009
03:01:29,690 --> 03:01:33,381
competition for various reasons or they 
do want to compete in a bodybuilding 

4010
03:01:33,381 --> 03:01:35,070
competition and they want something 
alternative to do.

4011
03:01:35,071 --> 03:01:40,071
We've got a competition between a team 
la and team Atlanta as well.

4012
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:43,410
And we've got interest for the roll this
out internationally.

4013
03:01:43,411 --> 03:01:43,800
So

4014
03:01:44,430 --> 03:01:46,770
keep your eye on that man.
People go to it.

4015
03:01:46,771 --> 03:01:47,250
Where,
what

4016
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:53,260
superleague alive.
And the contest is in the city Athletic 

4017
03:01:53,260 --> 03:01:54,020
Club,
German in Vegas,

4018
03:01:54,021 --> 03:01:56,060
which is like the biggest German Vegas.

4019
03:01:56,100 --> 03:02:01,100
Okay.
And so the website for it would be 

4020
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:03,740
hopefully live or superleague.live.
I'm not sure what superleague live.live,

4021
03:02:04,111 --> 03:02:04,800
something like that.

4022
03:02:06,350 --> 03:02:11,350
And uh,
I'm going to be there Sunday and a lot 

4023
03:02:11,350 --> 03:02:11,410
of other people from the,
from the sport and

4024
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:13,610
on invite Joe Rogan.
If you've got spare time.

4025
03:02:13,611 --> 03:02:15,770
I'm actually going to be at the UFC 
Saturday.

4026
03:02:15,771 --> 03:02:20,771
It's in Anaheim,
so unfortunately it's a good card.

4027
03:02:21,200 --> 03:02:24,680
Very excited about it.
Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier.

4028
03:02:24,910 --> 03:02:26,570
Oh Great.
And that's in Vegas as well?

4029
03:02:26,630 --> 03:02:31,630
No,
that's out here in Anaheim on a cowboy 

4030
03:02:31,630 --> 03:02:31,630
cerrone and Robbie law.
It's a great car.

4031
03:02:31,630 --> 03:02:32,870
It actually,
it's one of the best cars in a year.

4032
03:02:32,900 --> 03:02:37,640
I'm just joking.
So I would do whatever you want folks,

4033
03:02:37,641 --> 03:02:39,380
but superleague is going to be awesome.
I'm sure.

4034
03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:41,420
Listen man,
it was an honor and a pleasure.

4035
03:02:41,421 --> 03:02:42,830
I really,
really appreciate you having me on.

4036
03:02:42,831 --> 03:02:43,510
It's been A.
Yeah,

4037
03:02:43,550 --> 03:02:45,740
like three hours has gone like nothing.
Like nothing.

4038
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:47,750
I'm sure we could talk for fucking 24 
hours,

4039
03:02:47,751 --> 03:02:49,700
but I bet we could.
It's time to smoke a joint.

4040
03:02:49,810 --> 03:02:51,020
I agree.
Alright.

4041
03:02:51,021 --> 03:02:52,340
Alright everybody.
Thank you brother.

4042
03:02:52,550 --> 03:02:54,200
Appreciate it.
See you guys tomorrow.
