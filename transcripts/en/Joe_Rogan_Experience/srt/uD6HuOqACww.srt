1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,840
Okay,
sorry,

2
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:01,350
sorry,
sorry.

3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,210
Just a lot of people have to communicate
with.

4
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,350
You already started.
Joe,

5
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,100
here we go.
You'd already,

6
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,770
but did you really go?
Hold on.

7
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,890
Here we go.
This is how slow type you dirty bitches 

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,001
and you know what I type so bad is 
because I don't want to admit that I 

9
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,720
need glasses.
I need reading glasses.

10
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,670
I've old man eyes.
No http and people say Joe,

11
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,500
do you write all that crazy lines before
the actual.

12
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:27,660
Yeah,
to do them all myself.

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,661
I'm like a pro sneakers.
Oh my God.

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,620
Sneakers reference.
That's great.

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,950
How did you bust that out for me?
You do have a lot going for you.

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,490
We're going to get to that reference 
wise.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,260
Do you have any flashlights at your 
house?

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:47,600
Amy?

19
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,280
Dude,
this is the commercial he's.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,580
He's easing into it.
Have zero flashlights.

21
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,540
Are you guys promoting flashlights or 
flashlights?

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,740
Oh,
that's nice.

23
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,060
Well,
it's one of our sponsors.

24
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,380
Very embarrassing situation.
Yeah,

25
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:05,240
that's a totally different group ever.
Craving of pocket pussy like a.

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,910
well,
the tug and pull method and the 

27
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,840
flashlight where you put you take the 
actual flashlight out of it and it's 

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,541
like this big fleshy thing and you tuck 
it inside of you and then you pull it 

29
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:19,261
out slowly and it feels really good.
It's kind of like anal beads for your 

30
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:19,261
vagina and it's the second use of the 
fleshlight,

31
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:24,240
but you want to make sure you don't take
the whole thing in there because it 

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,240
could probably get stuck telling me 
less.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,660
Fascinating.
Tell me amy schumer

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,030
being silly.
Goose.

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,910
We have two commercials.
This what we do.

36
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:34,911
One of them was for the flashlight.
That really is a sponsor for our 

37
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:34,911
podcast.
We have one here.

38
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:34,911
I'd like to know.
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,150
I would have brought you one if I 
thought you were curious.

40
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,580
There was a gift bags.
Should I should start hooking that up?

41
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:40,020
Right,
right.

42
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,370
I had a boyfriend and she'd get together
if like I'd be into him getting that and

43
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,420
I was like,
I don't see how that would benefit me at

44
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:46,660
all.

45
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,820
Oh,
why would you?

46
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,150
Maybe.
So you could watch them.

47
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,220
Fuck something else.
So

48
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,230
crazy.
I was like,

49
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:53,430
I'm cool.
You could do it.

50
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,730
Maybe he can just fuck that thing and 
you spit on him.

51
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,530
Maybe that's what he's looking for.
That's what he wanted.

52
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:02,531
Yeah.
He going to make more time for us or 

53
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,240
what's that phrase?
While he's doing it like that kind of a 

54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,161
dude,
but I will never know minded that you 

55
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:09,161
never know.
I tried to find out.

56
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,230
Anyway,
if you go to Joe Rogan.net,

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,710
click on the link for the fleshlight,
entering the code name Brogan.

58
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:20,711
You will get 15 percent off the number 
one sex toy for men and our sponsor 

59
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:26,021
forever.
From the beginning of the podcast when 

60
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:26,021
we were scrubs,
when we like,

61
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,980
if this is like we've come so far,
but we have a room.

62
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,050
We have an actual space now with 
cameras,

63
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,230
but from the beginning of the podcast,
these guys were with us when nobody was 

64
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,230
watching,
reading,

65
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,480
listening,
whatever.

66
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,910
So they remain.
They remain.

67
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:40,490
Our pumps are our sponsor.
They're cool and it's a good product.

68
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,030
It sounds embarrassing.
Yeah,

69
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,360
it's a good product.
I don't love it.

70
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,180
I like it.
It's a good inanimate object,

71
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,470
but I don't feel love for it.
Don't be creepy.

72
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,530
I wish you were twilight zone.
I feel like it's possible.

73
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:59,531
I those real dolls know.
Have you seen those where they have 

74
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,070
communities of real dolls dudes like get
their real

75
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,340
dolls together and hey man,
my girl a girl though.

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
She didn't know that happened but

77
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,180
I made fun of it on my website once and 
I'm in a blog and then some guy emailed 

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,970
me his reality and as to why he has the.

79
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,600
Oh yeah,
it was really sad or the best.

80
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,050
Well it could've been,
it could've been troll.

81
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,860
Could have been in trouble,

82
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,870
but it didn't seem like it was.
He was one of the guys that was in the 

83
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,230
community that was a.
I was making fun of him because they had

84
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:30,320
all the dolls and their dressing them 
and shit and I'm like,

85
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,280
Hey,
what the fuck are you.

86
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,380
You guys are crazy.
And they were,

87
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,590
well then a lot of these guys are either
disfigured or something really wrong 

88
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,761
with them and so it is very sad.
It's a fucking what I should.

89
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,430
He rolled the dice with fucking a 
disfigured guy.

90
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,480
Some something like one little thing 
fucked up,

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,060
but what if he had a lot of things like 
that.

92
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,580
He can't be like all out,
like he's to be like one charming,

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,600
like a weird board or something 
somewhere.

94
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,290
Do something extra.
I think it has to be something missing.

95
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,940
A limb is gone that way.
Like everyone thinks I'm so nice and,

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,640
and I'll be kind of like grossed out 
while we're fucking but up.

97
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,190
But like get into it.
I think.

98
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,650
Hm.
Would the gross style part the benefit 

99
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:22,650
you?

100
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,190
I like that.
I like watching porn like that.

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,830
Like where I'm like,
would this make me puke?

102
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,460
Like what I throw up on this dude.
So I now,

103
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,120
this is how I'm finding my target demo.
I just like,

104
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,370
if you're disfigured,
you want to make me puke?

105
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,350
Yeah.
Come on down to the funny bone,

106
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,470
blah,
blah,

107
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,630
blah.
Amy Schumer,

108
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,640
you crazy.

109
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,310
We're still doing commercials.
Blue tonight doesn't seem like it,

110
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:49,670
right?
Yeah.

111
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:54,671
The cameras or anything of the flow.
That's the beautiful thing of the flow 

112
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:57,971
of this show.
We're also sponsored by [inaudible] Dot 

113
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:57,971
Com,
o n n I t,

114
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:02,141
makers of Alpha brain,
the cognitive enhancement supplement 

115
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:02,970
that I show you right here.
Vitamins for your dome.

116
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,730
She saw you take pills.

117
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,070
Oh yeah,
yeah.

118
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,090
You take them for real.
Yeah.

119
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:11,230
It gives you like,
it's not like as a prominent is like say

120
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,850
adderall or something like that,
but it would,

121
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,540
it would,
it does,

122
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,880
is it enhances the way your brain 
functions.

123
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,580
Anybody's interested in at Google,
the Google,

124
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:23,581
the word nootropics.
That's the best way to get information 

125
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:26,371
on it and try a bunch of different stuff
out before you ever even think about 

126
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:27,520
buying Alpha brain research.
Nootropics getting,

127
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,340
get involved in looking at what it is.
It's,

128
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,180
there's a bunch of studies about it,
you know,

129
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,100
a lot of them were done on people with 
Alzheimer's.

130
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,420
Um,
you know,

131
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,450
people whose brains weren't functioning 
until Wednesday morning and it helped 

132
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,571
them.
Various companies have a nootropic 

133
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:45,880
formulas.
Don't necessarily go out and buy Alpha 

134
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,821
brain,
but I'm telling you that we use it and 

135
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:47,821
then it's awesome.
I like it.

136
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:51,630
And if you don't like it,
you order it and it doesn't work for 

137
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:51,630
you,
you don't even have to return it.

138
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,510
You get 100 percent money back 
guarantee.

139
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,480
We try to make it as easy as possible 
for your first order.

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,190
Can I have more than that?
Because some people stole

141
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,840
it or something.
Dragons came.

142
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,980
Brian,
what was the story again?

143
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,740
How did it go?
It dragon's cave.

144
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,770
It was a troll who came over the 
mountain with a battleaxe and came into 

145
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,420
town and took all the Algebra and then 
put it on Ebay or something.

146
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,320
No,
no,

147
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,690
Joe.
You took my Alpha brain the other day.

148
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:16,691
And so I noticed I didn't tell anybody.
He just gives it to me.

149
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,970
Any launders sells on Ebay.
It's been him the whole time.

150
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,630
Uh,
yeah man.

151
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,750
That's my new theory.
I'm make like three bucks every time.

152
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,040
It's an awesome deal.
Anyway,

153
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,150
we also have a bunch of different cool 
supplements that are available.

154
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,480
All of them that I find to be effective.
If I didn't think they were effective,

155
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,410
I wouldn't promote them.
One hundred percent.

156
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,030
That's the truth.
Get into it,

157
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,430
check it out.
If you want to try alpha brain,

158
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,550
go to Joe Rogan.net,
click on the Alpha brain link and during

159
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,890
the code name Brogan,
and you get 10 percent off all orders,

160
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,900
not just the first one is money orders 
in the future.

161
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,820
All right,
benches,

162
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,610
Amy Schumer's start the music now.
The podcast officially begins.

163
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Joe Rogan podcast all day does a very 
mild version of the song.

164
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,140
They're like,
you weren't trying to hurt amy Schumer's

165
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,360
protecting,
protecting.

166
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I think that was.
I think that's exactly what he's doing 

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,360
because you find her cube.
I didn't want to start over.

168
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,980
You love her.
You love her already.

169
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,120
Looking at you already adjusting your 
behavior back.

170
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,660
That's some serious respect is usually a
blows your fucking eardrums out.

171
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,760
Silly and it's needed and then he gets 
silly with the fade out,

172
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,720
you know,
because he fades it out the entire wall.

173
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,450
Wall Wall Wall.
Go on for like minutes,

174
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,930
but not with you.
He's trying to be like really 

175
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,700
unobtrusive and really sweet and 
collages of pictures together.

176
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,130
You're making him the best.
You making them the best.

177
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:53,050
Brian,
he can be a job for real.

178
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,960
If it wasn't for you here,
I think you're making Brian the best.

179
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,660
Brian,
he can possibly a better version of you,

180
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,380
Brian,
for real.

181
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,670
Bring out the best in you.
Don't run away from this trend to troll.

182
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,410
Marry Yo.
I'm not trying to troll you.

183
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Women don't do that.
That's one of the things that he's 

184
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,500
playing a practical joke on me right 
now.

185
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,880
Guys.
This is going to sound totally 

186
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,160
ridiculous,
but you know how guys will sometimes get

187
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,330
divorced and the woman will get half a 
guy shit and then people will say,

188
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Oh man,
that's fucked up that she never told a 

189
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:24,600
joke or she never,
you know,

190
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,510
made one point.
You know,

191
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:30,511
how the fuck did she get half his money?
But the combination of people sometimes 

192
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,910
sometimes a woman will come into your 
life and she's such a bad ass bitch and 

193
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,400
you want to impress her so much.
You will be a better person.

194
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,890
Well,
I think the flip side of that is I think

195
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:46,891
what,
what chicks do not me know when you 

196
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,790
start dating somebody,
like I'll just like,

197
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,180
I'm the.

198
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm like super cool new girl.
Just sweep the crazy end of the rug for 

199
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,530
a couple months.
I'm like,

200
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:58,560
you don't need to see this.
You don't need to meet my mom,

201
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,210
who I'm becoming.
And then,

202
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:00,810
uh,
you know,

203
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:04,080
the truth comes out eventually,
but I think you're like the best version

204
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,030
of yourself at first and then you can't 
help.

205
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:11,031
But that's why I always tell the guys,
you should be the you who you're 

206
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:11,031
pretending to be when you're trying to 
get laid.

207
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:12,540
If you do that day,
that day,

208
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,770
that guy,
be that guy.

209
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,900
It is possible to be that guy.
It's fucking hard to decide and work on.

210
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:22,680
It might be the you that you pretend to 
be when you're trying to get laid.

211
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,810
I think vitamin D or something,
you got to do squats,

212
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,760
deadlifts,
watch doesn't give you a kettle bells,

213
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,500
Sean,
big fucking heavy ones.

214
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,390
50 pounders,
70 pounders.

215
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,090
You've got to really work the spine and 
the core,

216
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,820
all that is part of it.
You gotta keep your core engaged.

217
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,740
For sure.
My inner core.

218
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,530
So I think that Amy Schumer is like your
Muse,

219
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,410
is what I'm saying.
You know that she's hilarious.

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,590
You know that she's talented as fuck,
so when you're around her,

221
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:57,591
you've got like this guy,
crazy respect because you're also 

222
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:58,290
physically attracted to her.
Like there's a lot going on here.

223
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,450
This is the best thing.
You feel the same way.

224
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,870
There's a lot going on here,
Brian.

225
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,220
This is.
It's not bad,

226
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,630
but I know that's true.
It is so ridiculous.

227
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:21,261
I know what I want to do.
I'll get you pictures of you in the 

228
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:21,261
woods near my house where the outline 
is.

229
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,270
Oh,
let's go out near the near my house 

230
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,281
because there's been four mount line 
sightings sightings.

231
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,750
The attacks are usually on dogs and a 
lot of rabbits get fucked up and the 

232
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,290
occasional deer,
if they catch a deer,

233
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,330
they'll basically fuck up anything.
So they try to avoid people as much as 

234
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,711
possible,
so it's really weird that they've seen 

235
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,760
for or at least one four times in the 
course of it might be the same one.

236
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,850
Most likely you ever watched.
I survived and the mountain lion one's 

237
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:53,010
really fucked me up.
Just like they scalp you,

238
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,800
they're horrific.
They're so dangerous.

239
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,090
You don't even have any idea of how 
strong they are when you see one.

240
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,450
There was one when I was in Colorado,
they had a stuffed one like this.

241
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,230
They have this crazy,
a wildlife exhibit place where,

242
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:07,830
uh,
there,

243
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,840
there was this guy taking care of like 
all these different tigers that were 

244
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:12,990
from zoos and all.
So it was like a big,

245
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,490
huge area filled with big cats,
but they had a stuffed mountain lion and

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,010
it was like 200 pounds,
a hundred 50,

247
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,580
200 pounds.

248
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,980
But it's,
when you look at the dimensions,

249
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:25,610
that's what it freaks you out.
You see the width of its paws.

250
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,620
It's wrist is like twice the size of a 
man's.

251
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,990
There are enormous risks.
And then you look at the bones of the 

252
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,510
pause and you look at the fucking head,
all of it designed to fuck shit up.

253
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,700
Big Cat as big as a person.
This is essentially what it is.

254
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,920
It's a big man,
but it's a cat.

255
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,570
Two hundred pounds.
Fucking the one I saw and I survived.

256
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,630
The woman was trying to save.
Her husband had the and she was jamming 

257
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,720
a pen into the mountain lions and it 
wasn't even reacting.

258
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,760
It was just like,
what?

259
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,180
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yeah.

260
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,230
You'd have to break that thing.
Are you scared to be outside of your 

261
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,600
house?
I pack heat.

262
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,750
You know what I do when I go outside.
Some of the Times I go outside to take a

263
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,090
leak just to put my mark around the 
house.

264
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,560
That's not weird.
In my underwear with a gun in my 

265
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,980
underwear.
Just tucked the gun in my underwear.

266
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,900
See I just pooping little coffee cans 
inside my house and then they just put 

267
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:26,900
them.

268
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,580
We should have more secrets for me to 
start now.

269
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,090
It'll just be a job.
I don't really walk around.

270
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,720
I'm just fucking around,
but I did when I was hiking in Colorado.

271
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:43,721
I did always use to bring on just for 
that very reason just for the mountain 

272
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,660
lion reason.
Most likely it never happens,

273
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:46,070
but fuck.
If it does happen,

274
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:47,700
wouldn't it be nice to do it?
Shoot that count,

275
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,900
those posters that say like,
just make yourself bigger,

276
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,360
but you got to do something wild killer 
is looking at you.

277
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,490
I'm going to throw my friend at the 
mountain lion and I'll go get help or 

278
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,970
playing dead me.
Just push the south park.

279
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,060
When the actors had to save the world 
record,

280
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:20,070
it was just human shield.
Oh,

281
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,340
well,
mountain lions eating your asshole.

282
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,330
You remember that?
That thing we talked about a while back 

283
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:32,330
where I said if you ever get attacked by
a lion,

284
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,890
I would take like a piece of paper and 
try to throw it.

285
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,450
Like if it was a real cat and you were 
like,

286
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:36,350
Oh,
you're stupid,

287
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,650
but somebody posted this amazing 
documentary of this guy and you've 

288
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,360
actually seen it before where he gets 
really close to dig this.

289
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,390
These,
this line is male lion and this girl 

290
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,521
lion and he's holding a toilet paper 
roll and the whole time he's just 

291
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,000
holding it like in his right hand and 
then like at the cat starts coming up to

292
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:53,820
him.
He's just like,

293
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
like about the throat,
the toilet paper roll and the cat just 

294
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:58,840
kind of like,
looks over to the right and like,

295
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,780
like just like jerking off the cat right
now.

296
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,940
Just kinda know.

297
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,440
But then at one point like he got really
close and the,

298
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,480
the,
the guy who was going to use that to 

299
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,050
throw it in the opposite direction,
he said that that would be like his only

300
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,880
chance to survive.
It was that little toilet paper.

301
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,270
Oh my God.
If I could find the video,

302
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,920
I'll try to find out if anyone knows 
what I'm talking about.

303
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,200
If I was to distract him with toilet.
But yeah.

304
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,790
Yeah.
I,

305
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,630
we have to watch this video.
I hope somebody tweets me because you'll

306
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,750
freak out.
Wow.

307
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,700
Because they've never seen anything like
it before.

308
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,210
It's because then their instincts and 
their instincts are still a cat.

309
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,340
Like where live you throw anything out 
of cat,

310
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,500
you know?
It will be like,

311
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,140
what the fuck's that?

312
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,300
We should kill all caps.
I love my cats and everything,

313
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,480
but I know the only reason why I love 
them is because of the size difference.

314
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,340
You know,
I'm way bigger than him.

315
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,650
She wanted to fuck around.
If she wanted to fuck around and try to 

316
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:50,650
kill me,
I could snap her neck.

317
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,880
Do you know what I'm saying?
Makes you love something.

318
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,550
Well,
no.

319
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,340
That's why she loves me.
I'm big enough,

320
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,980
but if the roles were reversed,
my cat would eat me.

321
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,180
Yeah,
for sure.

322
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,710
Should have cats.
I don't.

323
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,890
They're like abusive relationship is 
totally.

324
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,110
When they need something they're like,
hey,

325
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,670
it's me.
And then when they're like,

326
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:10,550
fuck off.
You can't have a cat and a pet mouse.

327
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,070
You just can't have it.
Do you have.

328
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,220
Can't have it a pet mouse?
Yeah.

329
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,710
No,
I do have cats.

330
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,870
I have two cats.
What are their names?

331
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,420
You don't need to know.
I'm interested in personal,

332
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,790
creepy shit with my.
Here's that video.

333
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,080
Sure.
Here's that video.

334
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,100
SPAZZ and Oliver not touching it.
Oh,

335
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,480
this is insane.
As he faces the kingdom,

336
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,060
just an ordinary.
Oh my God,

337
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,440
this guy's so that he's going to throw 
it at his head.

338
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,880
It creates a diverse look at that thing.
None of them have guns either.

339
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,630
Let's look at this shit.
Look at the size of this thing.

340
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,770
I don't know what you're saying.
You're talking.

341
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,800
It gets intense.
Oh my God.

342
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,970
For the audio listeners is a bear versus
a line man.

343
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,760
Big Man with A.
Yeah.

344
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,710
You got some questionable life choices 
when you've got a ponytail.

345
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,950
Anyway,
it is a bear verse.

346
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,370
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

347
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:18,390
Oh my God.
Look at the size of this thing.

348
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,780
It gets intense here for a second.
Jesus Christ.

349
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,450
It doesn't even need this creepy music 
like it's just intense.

350
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,160
That is a big killer.

351
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,810
A big wild killer flips its tail around 
sign that he was.

352
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,900
My potential danger remains both 
threatening with that line or that dude.

353
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,940
I think I'll take my chances.
Oh my God,

354
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:41,130
this is terrifying.
Can you imagine that?

355
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,040
Look at the size of its arms.
Just look at that thing.

356
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,220
It's beautiful.
It's horrifying.

357
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:50,120
At the same time,
the idea of that thing,

358
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,540
looking at you,
my 600 pound fucking monster,

359
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:59,541
that just kills things every day in 
Africa at Jesus fucking Christ.

360
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,840
The second line,
second line,

361
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,970
second line,
the back of,

362
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,780
Oh my God,
Oh my God,

363
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:14,500
this guy's alone with the two of them.
This guy in Narnia beyond the limits.

364
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,100
Oh my God,
he is fucking up here.

365
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,230
This is where it gets fucked up.
Crazy,

366
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:20,910
right here.
Didn't seem scared.

367
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:22,810
Is he just that cool?
Stoned?

368
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,350
Yeah.
They put my bags and he's on meds.

369
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,540
Just dropped him in a field or a good 
luck.

370
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,140
Here's a ball of paper.
Look at that thing like,

371
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,490
God,
this is like a fucking werewolf movie.

372
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,090
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

373
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Oh my God.
This insane.

374
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,220
It's walking away.
Oh my God.

375
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,470
And then that is it.
Oh my God.

376
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,570
I walked away.
Jesus Christ.

377
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,390
That's terrifying.
But yeah,

378
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,330
so my paper theory is totally legit.
Wow.

379
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Brian read bids theory.
So if you're getting attacked by a 

380
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,370
tiger,
get some paper,

381
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,100
crinkle in the ball and then it right 
before it attacks you,

382
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:16,130
just like you're going to throw it.
It's um,

383
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,970
is it the big,
the emotion of it?

384
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,630
Like you're throwing something white and
they don't know what the fuck it is.

385
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Fuck.
I think it's just a hack into the brain 

386
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,160
of a cat or a feline that for some 
whatever reason,

387
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,640
they they that crinkly noise that,
that ball,

388
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,100
that what's the in your hand type thing?
It doesn't know what it is,

389
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,210
so it's just spazzes out like,
what the fuck this.

390
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,850
So lucky cats are stupid as fuck.
I was so lucky.

391
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,540
Toilet paper distracts them.
Oh,

392
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,550
that was scary.
That was one of those things.

393
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,560
We need those shitty blurry youtube 
style video who still absolutely 

394
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,630
terrifying.
There's got to be an hd version of that.

395
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,980
Oh yeah man,
man.

396
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:57,981
Versus wild pride.
A male lion and it's off the road.

397
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,220
Is it the animal planet?

398
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,750
So it was like an animal planet DVD 
that's available.

399
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,730
Yeah man.
Versus what it says,

400
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:08,731
man vs wild pride and I don't know if 
that's reverses wild prod Jesus Christ.

401
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,940
I want to know that guys deal with that 
dude who's taken.

402
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,670
Well,
you know,

403
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,790
he's another one of those dudes.
Those wild.

404
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,980
I'm going to get close to animal dudes 
that have been popping up a lot lately.

405
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,210
We should really say rest in peace if he
is dead because he's probably as.

406
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,670
That looks like an old video and he's 
doing that kind of shit.

407
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:28,960
He's probably not even alive anymore.
He was on his last leg

408
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,080
I think.
I guess Steve Irwin Sorta started that 

409
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,080
all off,
you know,

410
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,460
because he was like real wild animals.
The crocodile hunter dude.

411
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,860
He would get like right up to him and 
you know.

412
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,900
And what was the one with the black 
bear?

413
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,070
What was that movie?
Oh,

414
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:46,580
grizzly man.
It was a brown bear was.

415
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,040
Yeah,
the brown bears are the big ones.

416
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,370
Have Black bears out that dangerous 
black bears are.

417
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,450
They don't really attack people as much 
or kill people as much.

418
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,300
It's the bigger bears and brown bears.
Yeah.

419
00:19:56,301 --> 00:20:01,301
He was that dude who lives in Alaska and
they said that he was essentially death 

420
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,900
by bear.
I mean he suicided himself.

421
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,350
He wanted to do that as suicide by bear.
He just stayed late,

422
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,730
you know,
that's supposed to be there.

423
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:12,731
The bears that are awake are super 
dangerous because they can't kill 

424
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:12,731
anything.
So you're not fat enough to hibernate,

425
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:12,740
you know?

426
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,120
And so they'll,
they'll eat anything.

427
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:15,670
They eat babies,
they were eating babies,

428
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:20,671
so he caught the meeting babies and uh,
he's still stuck around for a girl.

429
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,080
I always think about his girlfriend.
Yeah,

430
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,580
absolutely.
She died after she tried to help him.

431
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:32,360
Apparently the video is,
there was a cap over the camera,

432
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:36,800
but the audio is there of the whole 
event and it's like six minutes long.

433
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Yeah.
Because he only played like the very 

434
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,240
beginning of that,
right?

435
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,500
No,
they didn't play any of the audio of the

436
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,350
attack.
The in the,

437
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,820
in the movie,
his ex wife or his ex girlfriend,

438
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,830
whatever it is,
is listening to it.

439
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,070
She's listening to the audio and she's 
the one who decides at her and Werner 

440
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,070
Herzog,
the,

441
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,580
the,
the guy who's director,

442
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,910
they decided not to release it,
but it's a long audio too.

443
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,920
It's like,
bears don't kill you.

444
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,700
They just eat

445
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,250
and eventually you die.
It's a completely different deal than a 

446
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,311
cat.
You're way better off getting killed by 

447
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:12,311
cats.
Cats,

448
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:12,311
cats kill you.
Well,

449
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,840
they kill you.
The first thing I'm going to do is grab 

450
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:16,840
a hold of your neck.
And they gonna kill you.

451
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,470
That's their instinct.
Harris just hold you and start eating.

452
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,100
Was there any proof that the wife of 
that bear dude didn't have a penis,

453
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:25,400
right?

454
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,240
Those,
yes.

455
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:28,370
She was a real woman.
She was sad,

456
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,130
you know,
some,

457
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,810
some women get roped up with guys and 
they can't find a man.

458
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:35,720
So they find some guys doesn't want to 
believe that he's gay.

459
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:37,370
So he's living in the woods with bears 
and shit.

460
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,040
He was crazy obviously getting,
you know,

461
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,370
I mean like as gay as you can get.
And I think,

462
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,690
you know,
for some dudes the,

463
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,120
the desire to stay in the closet is so 
strong.

464
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,330
It leads to be so fucking crazy.
They're willing to go live with,

465
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,400
you know,
and he had this whole thing always 

466
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,400
protecting.
I'm protecting these bears.

467
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,110
Does the forest department want to help 
them now?

468
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,210
Does that.
Sheriff Department went to help them now

469
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,180
the wildlife you fuck you,
you motherfucker.

470
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,500
And he was like yelling and screaming at
the camera and point at them and then he

471
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,590
would

472
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,450
like,
like,

473
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,550
like reconstitute himself,
clean himself up,

474
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,950
get back in and do it again.
And do another take on it.

475
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:12,780
He did it.

476
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,920
Dick

477
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,630
Probably.
I think that would have certainly helped

478
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:23,631
him.
I think he was eight and he had this 

479
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:23,631
crazy thing where he was like walking,
holding the camera,

480
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:24,630
talking about if he was just gay,

481
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,390
if I was gay,
so I could just go to.

482
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,210
Yes.
Yeah,

483
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:29,830
I could do it.
You know,

484
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:33,140
you go to a rest stop.
But oh well not gay.

485
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,750
It's just,
it was the most obvious.

486
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:37,820
I'm gay,
like cry for help.

487
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,000
It was really sad.
It was sad because that's.

488
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,710
It's fucked up that it's fucked up to 
dudes.

489
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:45,050
Get stuck in that closet situation,
man.

490
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,970
You know,
that's a terrible place to be.

491
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:50,030
To pretend your whole life to be one 
thing when you really.

492
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:52,420
You could just say you another and 
everybody will still love you.

493
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,580
You know?
It's like you don't have to like.

494
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,590
I know.
I know dudes that are in the closet 

495
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,590
today.
Tommy Thompson.

496
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,720
Bird growing thought we weren't going to
talk about that on the air.

497
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,920
Dick,
dare you.

498
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,770
Oh,
we'll edit it.

499
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,110
I think we're doing it live on ustream 
right now.

500
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,710
Fuckhead,
how dare you fucking.

501
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,470
Oh yeah,

502
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,400
they don't really fuck.
They just start to fuck and they come 

503
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,571
prematurely all over each other.
They were actually becomes burden and 

504
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:25,680
Tom Fucking,
they're so hot for each other in the 

505
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:25,680
idea of them fucking.
It's so hot.

506
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,100
They never.
They never get it inside.

507
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,480
No.
They just come close to the.

508
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,980
They're trying to be less.

509
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,120
Hey,
just so that they could have gay sex.

510
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,880
There's so gay.
They can't even actually consummate.

511
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,560
No,
no.

512
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,260
They just,
they just,

513
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,060
they just start twitching and coming on 
themselves.

514
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,130
Great to think about.
I'm like

515
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,090
picturing bird's family,
like what?

516
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,940
His family is totally down.
Don't worry anybody's cool.

517
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,210
The coolest burt's kid.
You got to know what the fuck is up.

518
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,290
This craziness in the world.
They're ready for anything.

519
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,450
It's probably best for him that they 
running the house.

520
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:03,590
Could you imagine if he were in the 
house?

521
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,140
You know,
it's crazy.

522
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,000
I could just picture those girls.
Making them dress up for a tea party.

523
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,420
Of course.
I'm sure he does.

524
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:14,421
All that stuff works.
You have to do all this stuff when you 

525
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:14,421
have kids.
Bert Kreischer,

526
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,130
he's uh,
he's uh,

527
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:20,131
another one of those dudes that I think 
the Internet is perfect for,

528
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,780
you know,
like people get to see the.

529
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,480
No,
when you get your hero,

530
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,910
like when he's on podcasts,
you know,

531
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:28,710
you get,
you get the total,

532
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,010
you know,
when he's not stuck on,

533
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,710
like if he's,
if he's doing let him or something,

534
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,780
he's always hilarious.
But he stuck to like seven minutes.

535
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,080
He can get to really know them.
The experience to Albert Christchurch 

536
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,080
brands.

537
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,210
Amy Schumer,
how long have you been doing comedy?

538
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,760
Seven and a half years.
You,

539
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:46,930
uh,
you did that Charlie Sheen Bros.

540
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,780
And that's when I really,
uh,

541
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,190
that's when I found out about you.
I've heArd your name before.

542
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,620
People say you really funny.
I don't want to pull your head up.

543
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:57,160
I don't want to,
to go.

544
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:57,810
Uh,
you know,

545
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,850
guys always.
Every now and then someone will have 

546
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:02,850
this conversation when you see like a 
really funny check,

547
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,370
you know,
like,

548
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,540
oh,
there's another one.

549
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,860
So because you know how it is with 
comedy,

550
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,380
you know,
comedy,

551
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,940
there's lIke I'd say dudes,
it's hard enough to do comedy,

552
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:15,820
to be a dude,
but to be a woman just to,

553
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,900
to get over this societal boundary of 
you being the one talking,

554
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,730
I think it's way more difficult for a 
woman.

555
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,770
I think it's weighed more difficult for 
men,

556
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:28,771
especially meatheads and insecure guys 
to accept the fact that a woman's 

557
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:33,211
onstage talking and then your subject 
matter is obviously going to be more 

558
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:34,780
not,
I wouldn't say more restrictive,

559
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:37,990
but it's more difficult for you to get 
out certain things,

560
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:40,700
especially sexual stuff and you know,
and,

561
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:43,030
and,
and certain things about judgments and,

562
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:48,031
and politics because people are 
reluctant to take the opinion of a 

563
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:48,031
woman.

564
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,910
A lot of people are,
it's way harder I think for a chIck to,

565
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,960
to make it and be a standup.
So when you see a bad motherfucker come 

566
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,550
along like yourself,
you know,

567
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,750
I always get,
I'm always very impressed because um,

568
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,010
I know that it's harder for a woman to 
do than a man.

569
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,500
And when I heard john and charlie sheen 
row,

570
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:05,440
so I was like,
holy shit,

571
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:09,490
this chicken is fucking funny.
You had some really funny lines.

572
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:11,320
I was like,
oh shit.

573
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,800
You know,
I generally a like a lot of times 

574
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:16,800
roasts.
I go,

575
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:16,800
oh,
okay.

576
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,130
You're just being mean.
You're being mean to each other.

577
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:19,720
And sometimes it's funny and sometimes 
it's just,

578
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:20,980
whoa,
this is like some weird,

579
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:21,220
creepy

580
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,520
shit that guy's been storing about this 
dude.

581
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,230
You know It's gross,
right?

582
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,980
The way you did it was awesome.
And the fucking exchange.

583
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:31,680
You've got him with Mike Tyson.
Can we play that?

584
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,010
Can we play that?
We got to play that.

585
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,240
If we can,
if we could find it.

586
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,560
If brian could find it,
he'll put it up.

587
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:42,590
Because it was so funny.
Mike tyson was trying to go back and 

588
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,010
forth with you and you just handled him.
You handled

589
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,380
Mike Tyson.
Mike tyson used to beat a boxer.

590
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,830
It was really fun.
It was like when I watched that,

591
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,540
that was like in retrospect,
I was like,

592
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,430
jesus,
that just happened.

593
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:57,620
Like I just like,
man,

594
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,930
he just manhandled Mike Tyson in a 
verbal,

595
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:03,710
in the white girl bubble enough still to
be like,

596
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,750
he won't come over here like I'm going 
to be a.

597
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,140
But it was like afterwards,
I was like,

598
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:12,870
holy shit,
you shouldn't assume that.

599
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:18,050
Take a joke.
I mean he's away calmer version of Mike 

600
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,870
Tyson and he was back in his fighting 
days,

601
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,700
but what?
But he's a scary guy.

602
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,080
Was still like,
yeah,

603
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:27,081
there were some uncomfortable moments 
still where you like Pretend to be like 

604
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:27,081
he was gonna hit someone and you're 
like,

605
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,460
that's not funny to anybody,
but you will.

606
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,080
They'll laugh at it.
That's the problem.

607
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:36,081
If he has least fake punches at people,
people will laugh to out of uncomfort 

608
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,030
and no one's going to be like a,
you know what michael,

609
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,420
that makes me uncomfortable crossing a 
line mind.

610
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:41,970
But you know,
you used to be a professional fighter,

611
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,740
right?
I'd like to talk about my boundaries.

612
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,390
He's like,
yeah,

613
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:46,290
you just have to be like,
oh,

614
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:51,291
that was awesome.
I'm going to leave a couple minutes 

615
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:51,291
early.
Let them grab your dick.

616
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,770
He grabbed my dick the whole night.
You gotta let them,

617
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,220
as long as he's not squeezing it,
squeezing it,

618
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,070
and then you might want to call them

619
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,870
nothing but now.
But uh,

620
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,320
that was like,
afterwards I was like,

621
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:02,810
I can't believe that just happened,
but he did a great job.

622
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,870
I think he did even better than what 
they made it look like.

623
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,620
The wrIters are all kind of sweating if 
he was going to be able to deliver.

624
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,940
But I thought he like nailed it.

625
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,060
Yeah.
Well,

626
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,190
what did you think that he was going to 
be able to do?

627
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,810
You just thought,

628
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,710
well,
I,

629
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:18,500
I didn't know the writers who had been 
working with him were kind of like,

630
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,660
oh,
we hope he was like the wild card.

631
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:25,661
Like he might just bug out,
like say be completely incoherent 

632
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:30,190
because they had like a concept for him 
that he was going to speak really 

633
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,930
intelligently and spout poetry and you 
know,

634
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,030
and uh,
but he did a great job.

635
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,350
Well,
he used,

636
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,050
that's what he mean.
He was like a weird sort of a,

637
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,490
a kind of almost like a ghetto 
philosopher when he was a young guy 

638
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:44,840
because he would like mess up words and 
stuff,

639
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:48,740
but he would quote you all sorts of 
crazy things like he was,

640
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,070
he's a scholar on boxing history,
you know,

641
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,070
and when he was a young guy,
he wasn't a,

642
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,030
an inarticulate guy,
you know,

643
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,190
I mean,
I don't know how much has changed,

644
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:01,800
but there's an inevitable decline in 
your ability to function after getting

645
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,190
punched you in the head.
Yeah.

646
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,100
It's inevitable.
There's a certain amount,

647
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,160
you know,
certain amount you eat and no one wants 

648
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,200
to admit that or accept that,
but then that is a fact.

649
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,490
To be totally honest,
I felt the only sort of remorse I felt 

650
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,940
that night was,
was for him because it was like,

651
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,300
he's for sure brain damaged and it felt 
like,

652
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,840
oh,
I think you fucking had to do what you 

653
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,941
had to do,
girl with crocodiles and you poked in 

654
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:32,080
the eyes and ran.
He didn't see me coming.

655
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,790
Yeah.
Did you have,

656
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:34,570
you found a brian?

657
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,450
they're all a bunch of fake ones.
Oh really?

658
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,020
Yeah,
like like it's just like,

659
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,970
like screenshots and.
Oh,

660
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,270
it been like copyright.

661
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,270
Some comedy central comedy central is.
Well,

662
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:51,530
why woUld you want to have a bunch of 
people watch it and see how funny those 

663
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:51,530
roasts are?
Yeah,

664
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,961
pull those clips down.
Fucking body spray or the site.

665
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,240
Is it because they want to sell more 
dvds?

666
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,620
Is that what it is?
They want you to add stuff,

667
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,670
but they probably have a month somewhere
on their website,

668
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,040
deep under commercial,
so there's.

669
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,810
It's so archaic that we're thinking it's
so dumb.

670
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,310
They don't understand that.
Yeah.

671
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:11,260
The more people that would watch those 
videos,

672
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:13,180
the more people would watch those 
roasts.

673
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,790
It's that simple.
If 100 million people watched the video,

674
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:16,330
I'm like,
oh my god,

675
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,040
this is awesome.
And then another roast is coming on.

676
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,610
Boom,
they're gonna.

677
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:19,320
Want to watch it,
right?

678
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,160
It's this weird thinking that you don't 
want it.

679
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,040
Anything good to be available for free 
online.

680
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:29,050
You fucking silly assholes.
How much do you spend spend in 

681
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,211
advertising?
They have fucking tied all of the 

682
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:33,340
commercials,
all over sitcoms,

683
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,800
and yet they're not willing to let 
things be free online.

684
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,960
Do you not undErstand?
That's the same thing and this one,

685
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,990
you don't have to pay for the crazy ass 
holes right here.

686
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,310
Here is a clip.

687
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,610
Have a it,
so be sure.

688
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,630
Yeah.
Where are you?

689
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:50,000
Turn girls were just making out with 
each other.

690
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,390
It was what?
What are you doing?

691
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,210
That is.
Hold on.

692
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,390
that's you having the other podcast 
going on in the background.

693
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:56,430
That was sam tripoli's voice

694
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,010
that hurts everybody's feelings.
Her saying,

695
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,540
no,
this is every week.

696
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,580
It's impossible for him to not do this.
Brian,

697
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:08,350
just be where everything's wonky.
Every audio clip,

698
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:09,760
it's.
It's part of the charm of the show.

699
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,130
You to accept it.
It's perfect in its imperfection.

700
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,330
They are nice dress sweet lady.
One of the waitresses of the seller made

701
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:21,010
that really?
Oh wow.

702
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:22,200
That's cool.
She's a

703
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,380
no,
I'm asking.

704
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:29,381
I couldn't understand a fucking word.
He said your voice sounds like a girl 

705
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:32,810
crying.
Every time you speak.

706
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:37,811
Do you give yourself an erection?
hey mike,

707
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:42,260
here's something you'll never hear.
Great tattoo.

708
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,810
Oh shit.
You have a lower back tattoo on your 

709
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,621
face then don't know whether to be 
scared of it or finish on it.

710
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,970
Look at that face.
It's so.

711
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,390
It's so dark and wrinkly and constantly 
getting pounded.

712
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:11,240
It's like patrice,
his grandmother's asshole after a gospel

713
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:16,241
brunch.
I'm just assuming she raised you.

714
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,910
Does that make you feel bad knowledge 
producers dead?

715
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,130
No.
No.

716
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:29,760
He was proud of me.
He was my.

717
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,120
He was my good friend.
I love patrice and I wanted larry.

718
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,320
I wanted him to think I did a good job 
and I know he did.

719
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,650
We hung out a like at the after party 
and was like,

720
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:40,840
he was proud of me,
you know,

721
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,750
you did a good job.
the trees.

722
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,690
So you know,
like it doesn't matter what,

723
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,100
do whatever.
Patrice,

724
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:47,390
when I heard he was going to be on the 
day,

725
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:48,350
so I was like,
oh shit.

726
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,600
That kicked me into the next gear.
I was like,

727
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,670
that's cool.
Oh I,

728
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,770
yeah,
he's one of my favorite comics.

729
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:55,490
I was like,
shit,

730
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,620
I can't phone in even a second.
He'll be like,

731
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:02,621
he'll call bullshit.
He'll call bullshit on everything and 

732
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:02,621
anything.
Yeah,

733
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:02,780
it was fun.
It was fun.

734
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,320
Yeah.
It's just.

735
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:09,730
But no,
I didn't feel bad about anything but 

736
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:09,730
that,
uh,

737
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,120
that,
that fucking launched.

738
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:16,121
You write that comedy central thing as 
far as airports and I got a corporate 

739
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:16,310
gig,
like,

740
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,840
you know,
it must be,

741
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,700
you must be getting a lot more standard 
work now.

742
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:24,701
Now I'm getting more on the road.
I'd probably make a like maybe twice 

743
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:25,880
what I was making on the road before,
but I think that's great.

744
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,260
Yeah,
totally,

745
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:29,510
totally.
Look at that one video.

746
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,270
Isn't it amazing?
It still doesn't seem worth it.

747
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,160
No.

748
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,870
I mean good.
But just being on the road like I'm 

749
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,870
like,
it.

750
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:40,870
No.
Oh,

751
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,660
you know what you gotta do what you 
bring your friends.

752
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,770
You.
That's what I'm doing now.

753
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,270
I bring a ari shaffir or joey diaz are 
terrible.

754
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,790
Hey,
I love it.

755
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,960
I love it.
Yeah.

756
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,130
No,
it makes such a difference.

757
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,630
It's a night and day.
It goes from being a chore to being a 

758
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,340
great fun.
But what I also realized,

759
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,350
I've always stayed in the shittiest 
hotels,

760
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:02,540
you know,
but now now seeing a nice hotel,

761
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,400
the road is a whole different 
experience.

762
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:09,610
It was like he didn't want to touch the 
sheets and paired with some assholes 

763
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,410
that they'll be headlining comedy.
Kind of just say no to condos.

764
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,920
Like that's the only time I use that.
I'm a girl on the road.

765
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,740
I'm like hotel rooms.
I had,

766
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,320
I've seen comedy condos.
It not,

767
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:26,321
not hotel rooms,
but in comedy condos where they don't 

768
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,350
have doors on the rooms with dudes.
Yeah.

769
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,780
Like I've,
I've put in my time on the road.

770
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,130
It a dark days.
Yeah.

771
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,130
Comedy store.
No,

772
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,280
that's the darkest condo in the earth.
Oh,

773
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,600
I've heard of condo.

774
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,130
More uncomfortable post-coital moments 
have occurred.

775
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,560
Tablet where you walk in,
you feel the uncomfort of,

776
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:50,561
of roads,
stank road hacks and whatever.

777
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:56,010
Poor,
lonely fuck allows those road hacks to 

778
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,010
stick their dick inside of them.
And crabs,

779
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,190
ness.
Oh god.

780
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,450
I can say never again.
No comedy condos.

781
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,420
That's my friend.
I bring my friend with me now.

782
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,310
The next one is phoenix.
Phoenix was a dark line to the tempe,

783
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,630
tempe improv.
That was joey diaz.

784
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:11,960
His haunt back in the dark days of joey 
diaz.

785
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:14,420
He would pull the fucking Shades closed.
You wouldn't even hear him.

786
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,460
You couldn't call him.
He wouldn't answer his pager.

787
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,660
There was nothing going on with joey 
diaz for hours come out to do this show.

788
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,450
Look like a vampire look alike.
bela lugosi.

789
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,110
Yeah,

790
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,560
I've been furious.
I,

791
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:31,830
I've been in condos where the,
I heard the feature at getting fucked 

792
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:31,830
and I was laying there.
They were getting fucked.

793
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,370
I was like trying to save you.
You heard him reading some hurt,

794
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:41,371
hurting,
getting fucked while you were getting a 

795
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:41,371
guy or a girl.
Guy.

796
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,740
Girl.
Guy was the feature.

797
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:48,741
Was fucking like a girl.
one of the waitresses to be specific 

798
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,540
where they allowed all the things that 
were they allowed.

799
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,320
I was like,
yeah,

800
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:53,820
I,
I gave them my blessings.

801
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,870
Enjoy you guys.
Go for it.

802
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,550
Did you guys like my new opener?
Oh,

803
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:01,130
nevermind.
Yeah,

804
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,400
it was awful.
And then,

805
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,700
um,
it was,

806
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:04,950
it loud was,
it was loud.

807
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,600
I felt like it was his way of saying 
like,

808
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,620
I'm the headliner.

809
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,790
That's hilarious.
You felt like that?

810
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,470
I did.
I mean that could have been winter.

811
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,490
So funny,
like even just a guy getting laid will 

812
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,291
be like a message.
I felt like he was sending me a message 

813
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:19,460
trying to get laid.
That is the.

814
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,380
Why would you assume that the thing that
men want more than anything else in life

815
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:28,381
is to get laid.
Why would you assume that him getting 

816
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:28,381
laid would be anything other than maybe 
getting laid little

817
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:32,410
comics?
Egos are bigger than their cox for sure.

818
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,740
For sure.
I think it would be more like waitress.

819
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,790
No one under any circumstances would 
have wanted to bang this girl.

820
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,260
Oh.
I think it would be more like,

821
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:46,261
hey,
I'm being loud because I want you to 

822
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:46,261
know that if you want to join us,
you can be a little of that.

823
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,000
Second of all you.
You say that,

824
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:54,490
but the guy was fucking guy and I'm sure
he wasn't the first seeing even though 

825
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,160
she was not a virgin.
Yeah.

826
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:57,470
Even though like you would say girls 
like not really pretty.

827
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,540
Just willing for a lot of guys better 
than masturbation were pathetic,

828
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,740
pathetic creatures.
I don't know.

829
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,790
Oh yeah.
You don't understand what it's like to 

830
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:09,790
have a dIck.
I don't know.

831
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,751
I talked to um,
talked to chaz bono because she's 

832
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:14,190
starting to make sense now during 
shooting up the testosterone.

833
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,020
She's totally making sense these days.
Yes.

834
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,810
She can like really talk about that shit
now.

835
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:21,350
What's fascinating because she really 
has gone from both extremes where he.

836
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,030
No,
no.

837
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,350
I mean talking about like,
what's,

838
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:29,410
what's annoying and,
and then the sexual urges that come on 

839
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,830
because of testosterone.
Men go blank.

840
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,320
They get sad.
They don't get to know what's going on,

841
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,440
but I don't know,
like I've dated guys and I've been the 

842
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,110
one in a couple of relationships where I
was always initiating sex.

843
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Oh no,
I feel like it's a super charged on my 

844
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,170
own.
Yeah.

845
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,970
I don't have a dick,
so I'm not like,

846
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,930
it's not brushing up against stuff by 
accident.

847
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,910
I'm getting excited,
but uh,

848
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,010
but I don't know.
Uh,

849
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,650
I dunno.
I feel driven by sex.

850
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:58,130
Do you think you're driven by success?
Like to get sex?

851
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,220
No.
No,

852
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,400
no,
I'm not driven by success.

853
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,160
I feel like sexually driven like a lot 
of the time.

854
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Right.
What I was saying is that if a guy like 

855
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,400
is,
is getting laid,

856
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,980
most likely that's just getting laid 
like comes razor you would,

857
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,760
but you would think that they were 
trying to send a message to you.

858
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,980
I'm the headliner

859
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,200
loud.
He was like very.

860
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,510
Everything he did that weekend was 
really annoying.

861
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:31,511
Like he was trying to,
he would like take his coffee on stage 

862
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:32,420
and do a lot of crowd work and just.
And then you'd be like,

863
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,920
stick around,
you're going to enjoy amy.

864
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,190
Like it was like so annoying

865
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,360
that.
I don't know.

866
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,450
I thought that was an extension of those
things.

867
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,450
Doing a lot of crowd work.
Like when you're not a headliner.

868
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,300
Oh,
I'm sorry.

869
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:47,150
I thought you said he was the headliner,
the headliner.

870
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,450
Oh,
I was confused because I thought you 

871
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:52,450
were saying by him being loud,
it was his way of saying I'm the head.

872
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,770
no,
like he was saying like I should be 

873
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:57,770
headlines.

874
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:57,770
Oh,
trying to alpha me.

875
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,130
Always total miscommunication.
Oh,

876
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,150
I would see that.
I could totally see how like middle 

877
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,150
acts,
whatever.

878
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,150
Yeah,

879
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,150
yeah.
No,

880
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,430
I was,
I was headlining and he was all weekend 

881
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:08,430
trying to assert himself like in the 
green room.

882
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,170
Changing shit.
Please make sense.

883
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,650
I don't have the energy.
I'm just like,

884
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,430
you know,
you're just like trying to feel good and

885
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:17,380
be positive and whatever on the road.
And then

886
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,610
so he would like try to put on the tv 
what he wanted to watch.

887
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,420
Like if you were watching.

888
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,290
Yeah,
he'd be like big base,

889
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,040
some baseball game.
I was just like,

890
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,750
oh,
oh really?

891
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,530
Yeah.
And I don't want to get into like a.

892
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,980
Yeah,
into an ego battle.

893
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,930
Yeah.
Drive fucking will

894
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,290
dude.
Something like working for women,

895
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,040
that's for sure.
Yeah.

896
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,640
And especially like ego saying

897
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,450
I try to be sensitive to that shit 
though.

898
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,750
Know I just want to be treated like you 
would treat.

899
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,510
But I,
I definitely get treated differently,

900
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,090
uh,
expectation wise on the road.

901
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,260
But like,
because I'm a girl,

902
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:56,261
they'll think there's some expectation,
like not necessarily that I'm going to 

903
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:00,400
hook up with them,
but that I'm a girl so they'll come in 

904
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,311
the green room.
Like this past weekend this guy was 

905
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:03,311
talking to me like,
uh,

906
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:03,311
just letting me know like,
hi,

907
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,700
I'm from here and did it and I was like 
[inaudible] [inaudible],

908
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,570
like why would you do that to intel?
Would you do,

909
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,780
would you come in the greenroom and 
trying to like paint your picture and 

910
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:15,170
give me your bio and

911
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,360
he's,
how is he doing this?

912
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,980
You say you feel like when a guy does 
this,

913
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:23,981
he does this,
he doesn't like respect to would a male 

914
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:23,981
comic,

915
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:27,060
like I would like to be treated like a 
comic,

916
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,700
like you would treat the headlining 
comic while I'm on the road.

917
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,070
Right.
But they treat me like a,

918
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,130
like a girl and,
and guys are confused like how they 

919
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,440
usually are with chicks.
That's what,

920
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,070
how they treat me.
But I think I should be treated like I'm

921
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,190
the headliner that weekend,
just speaking to me like I'm working 

922
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,270
with you rather than like throwing me 
anything

923
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,960
and you're not even trying to like 
dominate them.

924
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:52,960
You just don't try to dominate you.
You don't want them just getting weird.

925
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:53,020
Yeah.

926
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:58,310
Yeah.
I just want them to treat me like 

927
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:58,310
normally and like they would treat any 
comedian

928
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,690
because there's some comics who won't 
even share a green room with,

929
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,120
wIth the,
the middle and the opening act.

930
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:03,590
Like they'll,

931
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,710
it might get to that point just because 
of how much like bullshit.

932
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,950
We've had problems in the past with guys
that we didn't know when we did that 

933
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,061
maximum comedy tour.
I remember we kicked that guy out in 

934
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:19,971
boston.
There was just super douchey talking 

935
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:20,400
shit about everybody while they're on 
stage.

936
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:23,190
Talking shit about me got really,
really drunk.

937
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:26,150
He was just a creepy ass hole.
And he was uh,

938
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,800
you know,
we,

939
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,770
we did,
we had like,

940
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,170
I know I don't remember what town was it
in boston,

941
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,100
but it might not have been boston.
It seems like it would be.

942
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,360
It adds up.
It might not have been though,

943
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:36,550
I don't

944
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,430
remember because I don't remember the 
guy's name,

945
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:41,400
but it was one of those things where 
there was in each town,

946
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:46,401
they had a different opener.
A local guy would come up and most of 

947
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:47,400
them were fucking really good.
Thompson was hilarious.

948
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:48,780
That's why I met tom.
He,

949
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:49,260
he,
uh,

950
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:50,790
opened up in phoenix.
Anyway,

951
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,820
this dude just got hammered and it was 
just.

952
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,100
And I said to brian,
I think I said to you,

953
00:41:56,101 --> 00:42:01,101
I said,
this is the last time I'm going to work 

954
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:01,101
with somebody.
I don't know.

955
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:01,101
It's not worth it.
You should just bring some sorenson

956
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:02,980
friends too.
Um,

957
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm not rolling like that.
We can be,

958
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,330
but it's like,
you know,

959
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,310
but you know,
you can work out deals with clubs,

960
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,880
especially with amy schumer.
You need a god damn podcast.

961
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:14,660
That's what you need.
Yeah,

962
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:15,530
you do.
That's what you need.

963
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,710
This is the number one promotional tool 
for a standup comic because they're 

964
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,490
really going to get to know you.
How else besides this kind of format,

965
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,000
how the fuck else is anybody get to 
totally get to know you exactly.

966
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,580
Um,
I just want,

967
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,640
I think I just want people to get to 
know me that I want to get to know me 

968
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:32,860
really well.
What about your standup?

969
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,940
My standup is becoming more and more me,
but it's just sort of an amplified 

970
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,670
version that whatever truth I want to 
get out there.

971
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,520
So no,
you're.

972
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,260
I mean that's not true.
You're right.

973
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:44,530
Like I do want to shows and stuff.
Right.

974
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:49,531
You know,
just sort of to promote the comedy as 

975
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:49,531
well,
right?

976
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:49,531
Yeah.
Yeah.

977
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:49,531
Yeah.
So,

978
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:51,430
but,
but in terms of people really knowing me

979
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:52,960
and like my personal shit.
No,

980
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:55,610
they don't have to know your porsche.
You reveal what you want to be.

981
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,130
I know what you're talking about.
Like I get what you're saying,

982
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,070
weird.
The national enquirer type shit,

983
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:00,140
like

984
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,050
personal life or if you're one of those 
weird purple that offers up every little

985
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:04,620
single detail.

986
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,510
No,
I understand what you were saying.

987
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,180
Yeah.
That,

988
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:12,080
that would make sense.
I feel like really intimidated by the,

989
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,430
like all this technology should here and
like I don't even know how I would the 

990
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,440
first step of starting to talk to that 
guy to ever see brian again.

991
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,980
Are you living in New York city?
Yeah.

992
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,250
How often are you in la?
Uh,

993
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,850
almost never.
Oh really?

994
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,160
You need to move to la.
You got to move on here.

995
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,220
Check this out.
70 five degrees I live is whether space 

996
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,780
your yard.
You don't want a yard and dogs and 

997
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,791
puppies.
You know what if I like had a dude that 

998
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,971
I loved and like we had a rabbit farm 
and I'm here in blue by,

999
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,710
you know,
Olivia Newton,

1000
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,340
john or linda ronstadt,
whatever.

1001
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:54,310
Yeah.
I'm hearing in the background while 

1002
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:54,310
you're telling me that I don't know the 
songs,

1003
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:54,630
but uh,
that sounds good.

1004
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,430
Linda ronstadt?
No,

1005
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,760
I don't know.
Blue by you.

1006
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,610
Beautiful song bro.
Yeah.

1007
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,830
I just,
I would live here in linda ronstadt,

1008
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,230
blue bayou for her because I want to 
hear the story.

1009
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,300
I want to hear your.
You're going to belittle my dreams right

1010
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:08,730
now.
I'm not.

1011
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,470
Just want a little background around

1012
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,270
music to your dreams.
So cold blooded.

1013
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,260
Do you have it,
brian?

1014
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:20,060
Yeah.
Just hit it real quick and I want you to

1015
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:25,061
tell me a horrible person who wants to 
tell me what the right relationship 

1016
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:31,001
would be that would make you want to.
Don't fuck with man.

1017
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,160
Stop

1018
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:37,450
crying.
Please don't fuck with my dreams right 

1019
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:37,450
now.
look at.

1020
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,070
This is a beautiful voice,
but it's a little sad since I left my 

1021
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:40,800
baby behind.

1022
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,270
Oh,
I know this song.

1023
00:44:44,271 --> 00:44:45,350
It's so sad.

1024
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,920
Very sad.
So tell me.

1025
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,190
I just want a guy who listens.

1026
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:55,610
There's a huge rod knows when to tell me
to shut the fuck up.

1027
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,720
and when?
Tell me that my mom's account so far.

1028
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:01,700
I'm like,
what you're saying?

1029
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:06,790
Can you get that camera out of my face 
or you fried?

1030
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,630
Fuck.
Oh my god.

1031
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,230
Wait,
I thought it was like blue bayou on.

1032
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,680
Okay.
Okay.

1033
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,950
I thought you were saying blue by you.
Uh,

1034
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,830
yeah.
I don't.

1035
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,070
I don't want to do this anymore.

1036
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,410
Yeah,
it's dark star.

1037
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:28,550
What is the law?

1038
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,560
Oh,

1039
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,440
was the last time you ever stayed in los
angeles?

1040
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,070
A couple months coming on your for a 
couple of months,

1041
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:37,660
like if I've,
I'm working on something.

1042
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:42,220
But you find it is because your friends 
are all back east or moved here.

1043
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh,
they did?

1044
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:45,130
I don't have any friends in New York 
really?

1045
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,460
Well I have like two friends,
but that's.

1046
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:50,170
What is it that you love so much about 
New York?

1047
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,070
I don't know.

1048
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,360
Okay.
I think pose.

1049
00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:00,010
Is that what I sound like brian?
Really fucking that you might be the 

1050
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:05,890
worst impression that's ever walked the 
face of the earth from wilson.

1051
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,650
I'm the next bank kellyanne though.
Listen to my amy schumer.

1052
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:18,250
It's fucking on point.
It's like hearing myself.

1053
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,650
Um,
I,

1054
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,660
uh,
so what is it?

1055
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,440
Excuse me.
Brian.

1056
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,060
Don't mock right.
Wonderful.

1057
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:30,061
and talented guest just because she's 
clearly too much for you to handle you 

1058
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:31,240
at the beginning of the show.
She was making you a better person.

1059
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:36,241
You've gone through a full relationship 
cycle and now you've become the bitter 

1060
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:39,331
guy at the end of every relationship 
that mocks his girlfriend and she's 

1061
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:39,490
packing her shit.
I just don't get New York.

1062
00:46:39,491 --> 00:46:40,780
I'm sorry.
I just don't get all right.

1063
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,830
I need that moment.
Seems like the scariest moment in a 

1064
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,690
relationship where you're packing up and
he's mocking you.

1065
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,130
You know?

1066
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,750
He's like saying like mocking shit 
boxes,

1067
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,650
would you?
Well this is happening right now.

1068
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,590
This is that moment.
You've got a full relationship cycle.

1069
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,360
And brian's like,
okay,

1070
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,320
you're leaving.
Okay.

1071
00:46:59,350 --> 00:46:59,740
He's like,
yeah,

1072
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:02,110
well I just have a fucking problem with 
people like New York.

1073
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:07,410
You know,
it's always the beginning in the first 

1074
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:07,500
match.
You if you were like stressful.

1075
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,610
I really love New York.
it's pretty amazing times square.

1076
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:13,960
How do you fuck with that?
Now he's like,

1077
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:15,230
totally over me.
He's like,

1078
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,060
fuck New York,
whatever.

1079
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,600
You guys have gone through a full 
relationship cycle.

1080
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,330
brian kinda let the girl like New York,
bro.

1081
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:26,920
I don't see why you're so creepy.
But yeah,

1082
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,940
like I like it there,
you know,

1083
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,010
because I feel like people in

1084
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:35,010
la,
a lot of them are playing at an identity

1085
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,980
a whereas people in New York,
like if there's like an old rich mean 

1086
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,840
jewish chick on the upper east side,
like that's really who she is.

1087
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Right?
People here like buy an outfit and 

1088
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:48,920
they're like,
this is who I like,

1089
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,200
you know,
not everybody,

1090
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,850
uh,
my best friends live out here.

1091
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,990
Uh,
and they're not like that,

1092
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:53,280
but

1093
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,530
I don't really know what you're saying.
They'll do.

1094
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:56,750
The vast majority of people that you 
encounter,

1095
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,180
the higher percentage of them are more 
fucked up.

1096
00:47:59,181 --> 00:48:00,740
And I'm like,
yeah.

1097
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:02,720
And I'm like angry going into any 
restaurant.

1098
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:04,400
Like everyone's looking around and 
everybody.

1099
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:08,360
It's just a totally different vibe.
I don't think it's all of the people.

1100
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:09,160
It's just like,
look,

1101
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,490
you know,
when I say about cops,

1102
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,130
like most cops are cool as fuck I,
the,

1103
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:17,450
the cops that I run into.
Most cops are good guys that are working

1104
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:20,060
on really tough job,
but there's a certaIn percentage,

1105
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:21,440
whatever it is,
one or two percent,

1106
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:26,441
10 percent.
And will you make the number up where 

1107
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:26,441
they're just fucking cunts.
They're just constant.

1108
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:27,860
But there would be concept.
They were construction workers.

1109
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,080
They would be counted if they worked at 
the grocery store.

1110
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,180
They just shitty human beings.
So you think the percentage for la is.

1111
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,160
Well,
it's because of the fact that this is a 

1112
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,160
magnet for people that want showbiz,
fame,

1113
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,830
what it is.
I mean,

1114
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,650
I can tell many people that come here 
with a pr,

1115
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,210
not a real dream,
but like,

1116
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,830
well I wish,
you know,

1117
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:47,780
and it's like they don't do anything 
about it.

1118
00:48:47,781 --> 00:48:52,781
right.
But they came here initially to become 

1119
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:52,781
famous.
You,

1120
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:54,530
you'll meet them at flower stores,
you'll meet them in this,

1121
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,660
this women people

1122
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,360
like I don't like those people.
And I,

1123
00:48:57,361 --> 00:48:59,490
and I,
I have like a weird,

1124
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,510
um,
my,

1125
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,680
like,
what I want from this stuff is I'm 

1126
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,850
confused by it because getting 
recognized and all that stuff is not.

1127
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,700
I haven't experienced it as being fun.
I like,

1128
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,790
I've gotten upgraded.
Sometimes there's perks,

1129
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:20,060
but I like anonymity in New York.
No one gives a shit if you are the most 

1130
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:24,411
famous person.
I feel like you can ride around the 

1131
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:24,411
subway and people generally leave you 
alone.

1132
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:26,700
I'm jew because nobody gives a shit 
there.

1133
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:28,620
I don't know,
I just like it more there.

1134
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,800
So you think people give a shit?
They're less than they give a shit here.

1135
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:36,830
That's what I do,
so that's what you want more people who 

1136
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:36,830
just don't give a shit about famous.

1137
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,080
Yeah.
Or about seeing someone famous or.

1138
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,410
And it's weird because it's like I want 
to reach as many people as I can.

1139
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:43,940
Like that's the goal,
but I don't like.

1140
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,530
I'm like,
I don't like,

1141
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,650
hey,
you're

1142
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,010
right.
I see what you're saying,

1143
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:53,011
but you're going to get that anywhere.
You're going to get that in New York 

1144
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:53,011
city.
You're going to get that anywhere.

1145
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:53,050
It feels like he become.
I hear what you're saying.

1146
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:53,740
Yeah.
Well if you,

1147
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:58,770
if you've lived there for a long time 
and the one thing that I definitely got 

1148
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:02,461
when I first came here,
I was going to totally move back to New 

1149
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:05,010
York after my first sitcom was canceled 
because I didn't like the vibe out here 

1150
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:08,371
at all and I was.
It was my first time ever working with 

1151
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:11,100
actors ever in my whole life.
I did this really bad sitcom on fox 

1152
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,600
called hardball was written by these two
guys that were brilliant writers.

1153
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:15,640
They work for the simpsons and married 
with children,

1154
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:20,790
but then fox got ahold of their sitcoms 
just to stuck cox in phase shot sockets.

1155
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:27,900
Fucked

1156
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,750
his ears.
It just really,

1157
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,390
it was like when the,
the,

1158
00:50:31,391 --> 00:50:36,391
the,
the brilliant vision that they had Jeff 

1159
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:37,700
Martin and kevin curran where the guys,
the brilliant vision that they had,

1160
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:42,750
it became like a,
just this thing that had been fucked to 

1161
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:42,770
death.
It was covered in combo,

1162
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,930
like a glazed donut,
sodomized.

1163
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,900
I always tell everybody this is because 
no one can believe how bad it was.

1164
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,490
These guys,
first of all,

1165
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:51,380
the guys who originally wrote it,
we were really funny,

1166
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,420
really funny guys.
And the pilot was funny.

1167
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,210
It could have been funny.
It could have been a decent show,

1168
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,510
but when they gave it to some guy who 
used to work on,

1169
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,780
um,
coach and he was like,

1170
00:51:01,781 --> 00:51:02,390
you know,
one of those.

1171
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:07,930
And then I,
I know those fucking robot shows where 

1172
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:10,700
it's like you could just plug it into 
your computer.

1173
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:11,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1174
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,940
And it would be it real easy to make 
that show.

1175
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:19,030
And one of the lines was,
I was on a desk with this girl and I 

1176
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,310
like,
we're about to have sex,

1177
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,820
and the,
the coach opens up the door and uh,

1178
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:23,930
uh,
I go,

1179
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:26,120
do you mind?
And he goes,

1180
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,590
yes,
I mind,

1181
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:32,150
that's,
that's my daughter.

1182
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:34,760
You're attempting to,
that's my desk.

1183
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,800
You're attempting to defile.
It's what he says.

1184
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,200
And I say,
I'm not defiling the desk,

1185
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:42,350
I'm defiling her.
That was actually a line.

1186
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,910
And they were like,
approved.

1187
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,140
That was like,
yes.

1188
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,530
Done.
Moving onto the next line.

1189
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,600
That was,
we actually said that with the cameras 

1190
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:52,600
on,
you know,

1191
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:52,630
that's how bad the show had gotten.
It was,

1192
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,650
it was death.
So I,

1193
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,720
I was ready to pack up.
I fucked up and got a lease because I 

1194
00:51:59,720 --> 00:51:59,720
thought this was going to go.
Yeah.

1195
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,270
So I had a lease for a year and I still 
had an apartment in New York,

1196
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:03,770
but I was like,
what the fuck am I going to do now?

1197
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:08,450
And I just like leave this spot on here.
And then I wound up doing another sitcom

1198
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:10,490
afterwards,
but I was ready to go and it was my,

1199
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,450
my thing was just dealing with actors.
It was just dealing with the.

1200
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:17,510
Did they're delusional.
I really liked New York actors.

1201
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,270
Well all of them though,
you know,

1202
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:24,770
I mean I'm sure if you.
It's like my comps and everything else.

1203
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,220
Most actors I think are fine,
but it might be like 30 percent of them 

1204
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,450
that you just fucking can't communicate.
But I've found that it was the same 

1205
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,000
essentially in new yorkers.
It wasn't a,

1206
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,490
I just think,
well it's the,

1207
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,140
they're,
they're hitting the hive.

1208
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:42,200
The way girls dress for auditions is 
different.

1209
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,570
Like I always look like shit.
I looked like newly homeless.

1210
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,900
I walk in the room they like are looking
at me like is she unit parked cars and 

1211
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,100
they're all like perfectly flawless.
A dress cool.

1212
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,380
And I get to be like nonthreatening 
girl.

1213
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:59,381
They all talked to in the waiting room.
But in New York it's like I look like 

1214
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:03,671
the other girl,
they all talk to you and when everyone 

1215
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:04,940
asks me questions like,
do you know where the bathroom is?

1216
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:05,720
I think they think I'm weird.

1217
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,800
The level of like cap beauty up here is 
very,

1218
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:14,801
very hard.
Like when you go to nice places and you 

1219
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:17,681
see girls and they'll have perfect tows 
and expensive shoes and expensive bags 

1220
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:18,720
or they look famous.
Glow.

1221
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,450
Yeah.
Um,

1222
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:24,451
yeah.
There's a lot of girls in la that are 

1223
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:24,451
hot as fuck that look like that.
Like that.

1224
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,670
And that's one of the things,
the commodity of like,

1225
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:27,180
you know,
if you're.

1226
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:29,040
All you're selling is what you look 
like.

1227
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,360
Good.
Fucking luck.

1228
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,280
Good luck out here because that's worth 
a nickel.

1229
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,910
And we age.
Yeah,

1230
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,480
it's 10 years ready.
It hard.

1231
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,670
You met her a year selling need that 
guy.

1232
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,690
That's why have you frozen your eggs 
here?

1233
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,220
Yeah,
my eggs are frozen.

1234
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:45,840
All of them.
Not all of them.

1235
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:48,690
You got to save a few for live rounds.
It's too late.

1236
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:53,691
I'll follow them out.
Which is the idea is that in case you 

1237
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:56,451
know,
you wait too long and then your boxes 

1238
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:56,451
dry.

1239
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:56,451
Yeah.
You know,

1240
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:57,180
this way you'll have to move up your 
eggs.

1241
00:53:57,181 --> 00:53:57,840
What's.
No,

1242
00:53:57,841 --> 00:53:59,850
there's no eggs left.
They all fall out,

1243
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:02,400
fall out of your body.
You still got to suck them out early and

1244
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:03,630
freeze.
Hold on,

1245
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:04,650
let me write this down.
Do you guys,

1246
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,610
did you know that you're productive and 
nice from joe and brian?

1247
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,760
Do you know the girl ethical terms?
Like suck out those eggs.

1248
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,330
do you know girls out here?
I actually store their body fat also,

1249
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:20,410
uh,
to be used later as physicians in their 

1250
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:20,410
face.
Yeah.

1251
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,470
Like,
no,

1252
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,860
no,
don't do anything with your lips ever.

1253
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,920
Yeah.
It's unfortunate that someone trick 

1254
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,221
girls into fucking with their lips the 
same way they did with their tents 

1255
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:34,830
because the tents worked because guys 
really don't care what a guy,

1256
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:38,380
what a girl has faked it.
So even though we know that there's like

1257
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:43,850
a bag of water under the skin that's 
making them pop out like that was so 

1258
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:44,280
fucking stupid,
but any,

1259
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,600
any movement and change the direction of
this shape better.

1260
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,600
It's like a egyptian hieroglyph thing.
It's like for whatever it is,

1261
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,910
it's the shape of the woman's body,
even though you know it's horseshit,

1262
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,480
but that is out the door with the lips.
When it comes to the lips though,

1263
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:01,510
we don't like that.
Well,

1264
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,950
you can't apply the same principles to 
tits as you can to lips.

1265
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:09,951
And that's what they try to do.
They tried to make the lips crazy and 

1266
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:10,590
puffed up thinking I'm just going to go 
with it the way they go with tits.

1267
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,760
But they didn't.
They went,

1268
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:12,120
whoa,
whoa,

1269
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:12,480
whoa,
whoa,

1270
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:13,680
whoa.
This is lips.

1271
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:18,060
You can't do lips the way you do tits.
Tits on crazy and outrageous.

1272
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:20,170
And guys,
I eat what's up like that you're doing,

1273
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,250
but you get all fish face on dudes and 
they get creeped out.

1274
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,110
There's something about the lips.

1275
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:27,550
Yeah.
I saw a chicken the gym the other day.

1276
00:55:27,551 --> 00:55:29,080
She was blow drying her hair.
She was like,

1277
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,500
not elderly,
but she's getting up there and she 

1278
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:34,610
clearly had implants and they were,
they had like the,

1279
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:39,620
you know,
the ellis diversity of her skin wasn't 

1280
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,180
holding up,
so the implants that kind of fallen,

1281
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,860
so her nipples were up top and it,
I was just,

1282
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:46,330
I couldn't,
I couldn't stop looking.

1283
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:51,540
I was just like.
And she was just blow drying her hair 

1284
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:51,540
like naked.

1285
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:51,800
Oh,
maybe it was her way of warning.

1286
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,780
Maybe girls would just like to take on 
rugged lesbians and it's like a,

1287
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,880
like a fad and the only way to find 
them,

1288
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:01,580
it's just going to let those rocks hang 
out in the bathroom.

1289
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,760
YeAh,
just a girl just looks like she's had a 

1290
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:06,760
hard life and she's,
you know,

1291
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,020
that's like a guy just fetishize.
People are in a weird shit.

1292
00:56:09,021 --> 00:56:14,021
That's true.
Maybe there's some lesbians that are 

1293
00:56:14,021 --> 00:56:14,050
only into running into girls that have 
had hard lives and so like,

1294
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:19,060
you know,
their tits are all fucked up scars and 

1295
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,060
shit and they look at you like what's 
up?

1296
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,860
And the next thing you know you're 
eating,

1297
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,020
you're eating box in the handicap stall.
Proceed.

1298
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,270
No arms.
Okay.

1299
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,200
No arms,
horrible implants like rock implants.

1300
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:34,670
I don't know,
I wouldn't want anything fake on 

1301
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:34,670
anybody.
This is a weird thing that dogs not just

1302
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,100
became accepted but fucking shot up.

1303
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,650
But I've seen girls that have got them,
like they,

1304
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:39,280
they,
um,

1305
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,370
they had babies and then their boobies 
got all dehydrated.

1306
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,680
You know,
they became pancake boobies and then 

1307
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,070
they got their breast implants and they 
felt better.

1308
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,240
Yeah,
I mean,

1309
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,370
whatever.
It's,

1310
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,500
it's no,
that does make it look better.

1311
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:54,880
I know.
It's stupid.

1312
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:56,620
It doesn't seem like it should make 
sense,

1313
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,300
but it totally works.
It's a trick.

1314
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,640
It's like the dumbest magic trick of all
time.

1315
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:06,790
What's on my shirt?
I can't know what's under there.

1316
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,320
It's a bag of water.
Yes.

1317
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,310
But meanwhile I'm like,
ooh,

1318
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,140
I like big cars.
Big real titties to a man.

1319
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,710
Just that's the shape of it that is on a
mud flap,

1320
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,050
you know,
gets our testicles to tingle.

1321
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,990
It doesn't have to be actually real.
it's like a symbol.

1322
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:25,690
It's so.
It's so iconic and the man's mind.

1323
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:31,220
This is the man's mind.
This isn't just your mind like from 

1324
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:31,220
talking to people like guys.
By the way,

1325
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,971
first of all,
there's no way I could know if it's an 

1326
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:38,790
everybody's,
but it sounds like you've talked to 

1327
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:38,790
other people about.
Well,

1328
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:39,460
do I think that's why fake tits work?
That's.

1329
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,670
That's why I mean that shape the 
hourglass shape of a woman,

1330
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,670
there's a reason why that is like an 
iconic shape.

1331
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,920
the hour glass shape.
Whereas for a man,

1332
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,820
I mean women like guys with nice bodies,
but there there's no like shape that you

1333
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:54,940
could put up that represents a man's 
body to a woman.

1334
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,270
I think every woman is really as a 
different taste in men,

1335
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:03,271
men's bodies,
but I think for dudes it's pretty 

1336
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,570
classic hourglass big tits shape.
That'S on the back.

1337
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,030
waifs though.
Those guys are broken.

1338
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,120
They're broken.
They have broken balls or one of them 

1339
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:12,120
doesn't work.
Right?

1340
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,690
What if it was suicide?
I want to hear that.

1341
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:18,691
Of course,
the chick that was his that's on sports 

1342
00:58:18,691 --> 00:58:19,270
illustrated like I love her body.
Like kate upton.

1343
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:24,271
Upton.
Kate upton is a hero on our message 

1344
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:24,271
board.

1345
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,430
She's hot as fuck.
Whenever there's a thread on the message

1346
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:32,431
board for one of our podcast,
if the podcast goes astray and the 

1347
00:58:32,431 --> 00:58:35,530
subject of the podcast become something 
that they're not interested in at all,

1348
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,110
it didn't start posting kate upton 
pictures.

1349
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,690
It's all kate upton.
It's hilarious.

1350
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:46,250
It's really funny.
So if like a guest like says something 

1351
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:46,250
stupid or they don't want to listen to 
them anymore,

1352
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,551
it just becomes a photo festival.
Fuck she is.

1353
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,760
She's not.
She's got she's meat.

1354
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,570
I don't like skinny girls.
I mean I like I'm.

1355
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,070
We can be friends,
but I'm saying I'm.

1356
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't find that attractive.
Right.

1357
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:04,000
Everybody's different.
Some chicks like black guys,

1358
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,260
right?
Right.

1359
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,090
A lot of black guys like fat white 
girls,

1360
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,940
right?
A lot.

1361
00:59:07,941 --> 00:59:09,490
A lot of white guys,
like chinese girls,

1362
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:14,491
like everybody's allowed to.
You're allowed to look like your wife's 

1363
00:59:14,491 --> 00:59:17,810
whatever you want.
I saw something today that reminded me 

1364
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:18,430
of one thing I definitely don't like,
and that's flat assets.

1365
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,440
Man's flat man asks,
would you see what I think saw?

1366
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,430
I saw somebody

1367
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,140
stocking something at a store that I was
at and I just sat there and saw her,

1368
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:28,940
but the lInens and things.
Wait a minute,

1369
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,770
did you see someone who was on there

1370
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:34,150
balcony who was naked?
Who paparazzi took photographs off?

1371
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:34,900
No.
Okay.

1372
00:59:34,901 --> 00:59:39,540
Because at ariadne from the ufc,
paparazzi took photographs of her.

1373
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:45,060
Yeah.
they were on her balcony and she was on 

1374
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:45,060
her balcony naked and they were like,
you know,

1375
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:48,340
from a long way away wIth a high powered
lens and they took pictures of her naked

1376
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:51,320
and put them all over the series.
Yeah.

1377
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:54,020
What made you,
why?

1378
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,320
How did that come up at it?
Some guys were saying that she had.

1379
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,630
Oh,
her buttocks with less than impressive.

1380
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,480
She's a beautiful girl,
but you know,

1381
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:06,481
look,
guys have to realize there's a big 

1382
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,251
difference between what girls ask 
normally looks like and a girl's ass 

1383
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:09,880
looks like when she's posing for photos,
when chicks are just walking around,

1384
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:14,881
like dudes like naked.
They don't even know that people are 

1385
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:14,881
watching.

1386
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:18,230
Harassing pucker their assets is fine.
This was actually imagine a 12 year old 

1387
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:21,950
boys asked,
who is this person,

1388
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,400
this person that was,
uh,

1389
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,230
a stocking something at the store.
Was that in her?

1390
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:31,400
I just had to sit there and listen to 
what you just said.

1391
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:34,280
This person that was stocking something 
at the store.

1392
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:36,230
What do you,
what are you saying her?

1393
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,720
I thought it was a young boy stocking 
it.

1394
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:43,900
That's how bad her as well.
So I sat there and just kept on staring 

1395
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,630
at.
There was no ass at all.

1396
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:46,520
Like,
you know what you're talking about.

1397
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,770
Just a woman.
Random woman's just like trying to bring

1398
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:49,670
you your latte.

1399
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:52,820
This chicken starbucks?
No,

1400
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:56,000
he's talking about someone who's in the 
audience and someone is buying something

1401
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:58,790
at starbucks right now I'm talking about
employee stock.

1402
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,540
Oh jesus.
Brian.

1403
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,340
I've said it four times.
I know you said stop.

1404
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,480
I thought you said stalking.
You knew what I meant.

1405
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:11,270
I didn't know you meant stocking item.
I'm just like.

1406
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,700
I'm like,
what Is he talking about?

1407
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:16,220
The employee was stalking someone.
What the fuck?

1408
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,560
And you're watching him stock them and 
they have a flat ass went.

1409
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:22,850
What kind of crazy conversation that was
listed,

1410
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,520
it was like one of those

1411
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:28,550
spanish things where you know,
you say the wrong word and they want to 

1412
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:28,550
shoot,
you know,

1413
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:28,550
no brand.
No,

1414
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,420
no,
but if you know what I'm saying,

1415
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,350
you think you know the language.

1416
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,810
Use the word correctly.
This led to one of those.

1417
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:35,510
Those fucking.
Yeah,

1418
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,550
that was bang castello first.
first.

1419
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,830
This person has a small ass.
Yeah,

1420
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:43,550
it was.
It was.

1421
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,290
It was.
Not only was it flat,

1422
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,170
it was like one of those indented 
assets,

1423
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:51,170
but it was so small at this chicken 
that,

1424
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:51,960
that right there.
I,

1425
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:56,970
I,
I don't know if I can date her because 

1426
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:56,970
to me it looks like a deformations.
Like I see her and I'm like,

1427
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:57,770
this would hurt

1428
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:01,220
me less if I haven't seen your ass,
but I've seen.

1429
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:01,320
Yeah.

1430
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,360
Oh my.
Yeah.

1431
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,810
My ass is horrible.
Everyone's a critic.

1432
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:07,430
No matter what asked is horrific.
Yeah.

1433
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,750
there's no way he should be talking 
about anybody's ass ever.

1434
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,960
maybe that's why he's so upset because 
he.

1435
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:14,230
It's something that he sees himself,
sees me.

1436
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,180
It's like A mirror.
It's like man in the mirror.

1437
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:16,900
Michael jackson

1438
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,500
it.
That is what it is by you.

1439
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:24,240
Just.
We learned a lot about ourselves today.

1440
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:31,130
I've been told by many of my ex 
girlfriends here do our podcasts on a 

1441
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,030
permanent basis.
Please.

1442
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,770
Yeah,
you should.

1443
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,360
You can live in a studio.
we can make you famous for real.

1444
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,910
You're a monster.
You're hilarious.

1445
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:44,660
I'm going to move here.
You guys were throwing It out as a 

1446
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,740
hypothetical.
That's fine.

1447
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,110
I'm not throwing it out as a 
hypothetical.

1448
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,560
Totally.
Sarah will have you on every week.

1449
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,380
You got a couch,
you got a bathroom for number one,

1450
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:55,470
so you can do through number two spots 
at the ice house everyday.

1451
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:58,650
I think you know what?
Every radio show that's ever existed,

1452
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,590
they always try to stick a woman on the 
show that goes,

1453
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,070
oh,
we need to balance it out.

1454
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,650
We're going to balance it out.
Men,

1455
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:08,690
men resistant like opie and anthony,
call them holes like it's like a radio 

1456
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:08,690
host that.
Those guys were awesome.

1457
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,750
They're right.
They're right,

1458
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,110
but you are different.
You.

1459
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,420
You actually would bring.
Oh,

1460
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:17,100
funny female perspective to a podcast.
You should totally be doing one thing.

1461
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,310
I know what you mean though.
It's like,

1462
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,770
okay,
let's find the least unbearable girl.

1463
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:28,070
I hope she knows when to not.
It's usually she's hot and you know 

1464
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,701
she's sassy.
You know she can hang with the guys and 

1465
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:32,070
we could call and we could call it your 
step.

1466
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:32,820
Mom's house.

1467
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,230

1486
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:53,061

Amy schumer.
Do you want to join the desk squad?

date natasha and then they broke up and 

1491
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:13,130
I love her.
I love him more though.

1492
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,140
You know what I'm saying?
He's a free man.

1493
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,040
Know him,

1494
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,060
but if He could pay my billS.
I don't know.

1495
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:24,530
he could help you a little because I'm 
willing.

1496
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:29,530
I'm willing.
I just heard natasha on a adam corolla.

1497
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,490
It was really funny.
She's very funny and that dunkin and her

1498
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:34,620
are cool with.
Yeah,

1499
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:39,660
they're going to be fresh.
I don't feel like you have to pick team 

1500
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,500
right away.
Like they're gonna be friends right 

1501
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:43,500
away.
Totally amicable.

1502
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:43,500
I think it's great because they're both 
adults.

1503
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,331
You fucking child still feelings for 
somebody you don't want is you want to 

1504
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:49,500
fuck them again.
Yeah.

1505
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,580
You want to fuck them again,
so just don't see them.

1506
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,780
Especially when you haven't seen him in 
awhile.

1507
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,710
Yeah,

1508
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,030
we got a problem.
Yeah.

1509
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:03,210
You know what?
The human body is a strange fucking 

1510
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:03,210
thing.
you know,

1511
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,391
when you,
when you had moments with someone and 

1512
01:06:06,391 --> 01:06:06,391
then all of a sudden you're in front of 
them again.

1513
01:06:06,391 --> 01:06:06,610
And especiallY when no one's around,
you know,

1514
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:07,610
if you like,
you know,

1515
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,020
you,
you,

1516
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,660
you,
uh,

1517
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:13,950
just for whatever strange reason,
just run into them somewhere and all of 

1518
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,370
a sudden you're standing face to face 
and you want to give him a hug.

1519
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:17,320
And so then you do.
And then the other thing,

1520
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:19,360
now what's up?
We broke up for a reason,

1521
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,440
but the chemicals in your body or like,
why does my penis starts going?

1522
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:30,310
We used to fuck her.
Right?

1523
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,670
We could do it again.
Remember,

1524
01:06:32,671 --> 01:06:33,690
this was fun,
right?

1525
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:35,490
I thought it was right,
right?

1526
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,900
yeah.
And then if you just keep,

1527
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,370
keep doing that over and over again,
you'll never get out of relationships.

1528
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,670
So my thing is don't talk.
Don't be at the same place.

1529
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,680
I've had buddies that will break up with
the same girl six,

1530
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,900
seven times because they will always get
together and

1531
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:52,420
just fucking is so good.
Then they just feels like home and 

1532
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:52,790
you're happy to not be fucking a 
stranger.

1533
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,590
You've got to be fucking the stranger.
And then on top of it it's,

1534
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,580
well,
it's nOt even that.

1535
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:59,880
It's this weird thing that happens when 
you break up and then you make up.

1536
01:06:59,881 --> 01:07:00,360
Like the makeup

1537
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,740
was like,
it's reallY intense,

1538
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:04,560
especially if you're convinced that 
you're never going to make up.

1539
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:08,310
Like if you have insulted each other,
I said crazy shit to each other,

1540
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:13,860
you know?
And then people get in like patterns 

1541
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,360
like,
and you can recognIze those patterns 

1542
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:17,360
when you start dating someone because 
they'll try to pull that shit on you.

1543
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:17,360
You know,
they'll look,

1544
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,720
you insult you and they'll say something
creepy to you and you're like,

1545
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:20,860
whoa,
what the fuck is this?

1546
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:26,130
It came out of nowhere.
What came out of nowhere because that's 

1547
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:26,130
just how they rock it.
like every relay,

1548
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:28,060
every relationship they get in,
it's like starts off real good,

1549
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:33,061
get real close to each other and then 
get fucking nasty with each other and 

1550
01:07:33,061 --> 01:07:33,061
then

1551
01:07:33,061 --> 01:07:36,890
cover and then recover and I only had 
one relationship where we got nasty to 

1552
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:42,351
each other.
Since then it's been pretty smooth 

1553
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:42,351
sailing in and out.

1554
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:46,370
That is the worst.
There's no darker feeling than someone 

1555
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:47,700
who you used to like tell I love you and
used to make out with them and use the,

1556
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:52,790
you know,
if you have sex with them and then all 

1557
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:53,730
of a sudden you like elena and each 
other and angry words and they're saying

1558
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:56,180
insulting shit to you take back.
You're lIke,

1559
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,320
whoa,
I only had one like that.

1560
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,630
It's been since then.
I don't.

1561
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,730
I refuse to participate in that shit.
No,

1562
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:07,850
I haven't had a relationship like that 
since I was in my twenties and when I 

1563
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:08,830
went to the last one that did happen,
I,

1564
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,510
I clearly remember saying,
all right,

1565
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,520
this is never going to happen again.
I can never allow myself to get in this 

1566
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,290
of a situation where we're,
every time I'm around this person,

1567
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:23,291
there's some sort of like an argument or
debate or jockeying for position,

1568
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:26,540
you know,
there's a weird jockeying of power.

1569
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:30,320
Sometimes it goes on in some 
combinations of relationships.

1570
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:31,460
You know,
it's like you,

1571
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,570
maybe you,
your,

1572
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,810
your confidence triggers the weirdest 
parts of some guy,

1573
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,960
you know.
Have you ever had that happen where 

1574
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,851
like,
the guy is probably pretty cool with a 

1575
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:42,851
lot of people,
but then he gets her up.

1576
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:46,740
Think like you being a comic and being 
smart and quick like those two.

1577
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:52,070
That's,
that must be like issues with some 

1578
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,070
dudes.

1579
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,540
Um,
guys who aren't comics.

1580
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:57,570
Have you date guys?
Weren't comic's comic really fucked up.

1581
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:59,200
Huh?
Tom?

1582
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:00,430
Too fucked up.
No,

1583
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,790
I was saying to brian like,
I,

1584
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,330
I don't make statements like that.
I'd love to thank like.

1585
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,190
I'll never date a comic fan.
I dunno.

1586
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:11,460
I dunno.
It's like it's nice to be with somebody 

1587
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:11,460
who speaks your language.
That does help.

1588
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,980
But do you want to date someone as 
fucked up as you really don't think I've

1589
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:15,160
met him.

1590
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:20,290
It's just seems like,
it seems like you always have to follow 

1591
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:20,310
you,
fuck with somebody you work with,

1592
01:09:20,311 --> 01:09:24,810
you're going to pay in the end comedy 
clubs.

1593
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:26,040
It's like working at a place,

1594
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,250
doing your,
you know,

1595
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:31,010
your onstage doing your shit and you're 
like kind of doing,

1596
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:34,910
you're not persona but whatever,
like she do on stage and then.

1597
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:37,880
But then like seeing somebodY that makes
you so vulnerable and you can't,

1598
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,400
you can't like,
you know,

1599
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:41,780
in good conscience.
Keep up that facade when you're like,

1600
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:44,810
you know,
you just want to go home and cry.

1601
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:48,500
Sucks.
I've only dated one like abusive,

1602
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:50,690
crazy,
crazy asshole and yeah,

1603
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:51,380
I really,
I was like,

1604
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:52,610
I'll never do this again.
I never did.

1605
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:53,120
But we brought it up.

1606
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:58,100
Was it your first black guy?
I've yet to go to the dark side.

1607
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,650
my new year's resolution though,
I feel like the,

1608
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,640
I,
I hope that I fuck a black guy

1609
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:07,550
this year because my professional,

1610
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,460
but it's just like,
I don't know,

1611
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:11,290
I feel racist that I've never been with 
a black guy.

1612
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,650
Like why hAven't I?
Well,

1613
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:13,720
I asked my therapist,
I'm like,

1614
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,610
does that make me racist?
And she's like,

1615
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:16,830
no,
but I think she was just trying to make

1616
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,880
you feel.
There's this guy that joe wants you to 

1617
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:21,880
hook you up with.
His name is rampage.

1618
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,041
He's a really nice favorite video chain 
while you fucked,

1619
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,230
but you could probably.

1620
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,830
We're a chest protector and you'd be 
fine.

1621
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:27,990
For me,

1622
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,100
that's what I want.
I want like a brother,

1623
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:32,650
like I want to feel his ankle bracelet 
when we're fucking.

1624
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,200
We need like a ton of lube,
but just for his elbows.

1625
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Coconut lotion.
I think it's hobos dark girl.

1626
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,070
Chance you went down weirdo lane.

1627
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,920
I went down racist land.
I'm not.

1628
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,730
No,
I don't.

1629
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:52,740
I like,
I really did make that as my new year's 

1630
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:52,740
resolution,
but I don't.

1631
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:52,740
I don't know if it's going to happen.

1632
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:57,250
Yeah,
I know people that are comics and only 

1633
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:57,250
day complex and it never works out.

1634
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,110
it's just like not a good idea.
It's like high school.

1635
01:10:58,111 --> 01:10:59,970
You're at the same shows every night.

1636
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:00,700
Well,
not only that,

1637
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:03,130
I think it's better in life and in my 
opinion,

1638
01:11:03,131 --> 01:11:06,370
to experience things from when,
when you're close with someone,

1639
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:09,990
whether they're friends or whether 
they're coworkers,

1640
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,530
whatever,
when you,

1641
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:12,820
when you're really close with someone 
you're experiencing life,

1642
01:11:12,821 --> 01:11:14,040
when you communicate with them

1643
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,820
through a different perspective in a 
completely different perspective.

1644
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So if you're dating someone that has 
like a completely different set of 

1645
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,731
interests in a completely different set 
of desires and like someone who sees 

1646
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:25,731
life from,
you know,

1647
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:28,020
a totally different viewpoint than a 
performer.

1648
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,970
Like you're going to get your,
you'll,

1649
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:34,980
it'll,
I think it will broaden your 

1650
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:34,980
perspective.
I think you'll get,

1651
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:40,100
I think when you date people that are 
outside of your line of show business or

1652
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,030
even any line of work,
I would think if you're,

1653
01:11:43,031 --> 01:11:44,070
you know,
you're limited.

1654
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:49,540
Yeah.
If you're like a ceo and you're only 

1655
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:49,590
date ceo checks and you'd get together 
and have some ceo sex,

1656
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:55,050
what kind of line are you staying on?
They started to feel very incestuous,

1657
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:03,200
like just talking about like hear what 
quinton's said tonight,

1658
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:07,230
like right after time.
We fucked today before the laughter died

1659
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,890
and I was just like,
whoa,

1660
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,540
this is too close to home.

1661
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:14,730
Like when does the work stop and the so 
no,

1662
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,960
but right now when I'm talking what one 
of the greatest comedy cds of all time,

1663
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,750
fucking unbelievable.
We couldn't help it.

1664
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:20,740
Fuck,
we're so psyched.

1665
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,640
And folks who don't know if you don't 
know this,

1666
01:12:22,641 --> 01:12:27,641
is this a cd?
When dice clay was at dice clay by the 

1667
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:31,641
way,
wants to do the podcast and I got his 

1668
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:31,641
number.
I want to call.

1669
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:33,930
He doesn't have a cell phone and he 
doesn't have a voice mail at home.

1670
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,150
He just has a phone.
If you call him,

1671
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:37,320
you either get me.
Oh,

1672
01:12:37,321 --> 01:12:38,160
you're getting me.

1673
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:41,730
No,
it doesn't.

1674
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,360
It doesn't have an answering machine if 
he doesn't answer the phone.

1675
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,730
That's it.
I love it.

1676
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:48,960
I love it.
I love it.

1677
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:52,560
And when he was huge,
when he was at the top of the heap,

1678
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,490
he put out a cd,
two cd recording,

1679
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,980
a double album of him bombing.
He went to.

1680
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:06,490
You went to danger fields completely 
unannounced and you've gotta understand 

1681
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:06,490
folks wouldn't.
When this was happening.

1682
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:11,060
When dice put the cd out,
dice was feeling comes dice clay was the

1683
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:16,221
biggest,
most explosive standup comedian of all 

1684
01:13:16,221 --> 01:13:19,941
time.
I always say that there was no guy who 

1685
01:13:19,941 --> 01:13:20,520
had more success and he doesn't get a 
lot of credit because it was like really

1686
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,700
juvenile for several for whatever 
reason.

1687
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:25,800
For some people it's like not good.
I'll tell you what,

1688
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:29,580
I fucking love dice clay,
especially when I was a kid,

1689
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,500
when I was with my girlfriend when I 
was,

1690
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:33,060
when we were like 19,
18,

1691
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:38,061
19,
and we're listening to a cassette of 

1692
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:38,061
andrew dice clay.

1693
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:41,000
We were fucking howling laughing waY 
before I ever thought I would ever do 

1694
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,640
stand up comedy,
but I remember thinking,

1695
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:46,730
this guy is fucking hilarious.
He just was going for every single 

1696
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:51,360
fucking thing going for us.
He's a fucking genius.

1697
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:53,380
And norton security guy,
kenny,

1698
01:13:53,381 --> 01:13:54,190
you know?
sure,

1699
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:59,270
sure.
Be dices guy and the stories that he 

1700
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,840
tells us even more,
he's fucking crazy.

1701
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,610
So this is what he does.
He's the.

1702
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:07,110
He's on top of the world.
He goes to danger fields to shows up and

1703
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:10,200
he does an album with him with no 
material at all.

1704
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,100
He just went up

1705
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:16,030
and just talk shit for like two hours.
Ruined every audience member,

1706
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:21,860
blocked people.
Maybe there were like four people left 

1707
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:21,860
to be in,
I don't know,

1708
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:26,340
crazy.
It was a complete cd of non comedy and 

1709
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,410
he sold it and there were still some 
funny moments.

1710
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,030
There was a guy named,
there's a guy named Mike Donovan who was

1711
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:37,200
boston legend and when I was coming up,
he was one of the guys that I really 

1712
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:37,600
admired and he was crying,
laughing,

1713
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:42,850
counting dice,
doing nixon while he was eating the 

1714
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,470
girl's ass.
He's like,

1715
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:49,610
he's like,
I'll do mixing in that ass is nixon 

1716
01:14:51,951 --> 01:14:56,951
impression,
and Mike Donovan was crying tears for 

1717
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,400
fears in the back room of the comedy 
connection,

1718
01:14:58,401 --> 01:15:00,530
crying,
tears recounting it,

1719
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:04,160
talking about how great that cd is.
Especially for a comic,

1720
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:06,530
for any up and coming comic.
Man,

1721
01:15:06,531 --> 01:15:10,340
you must get the day the laughter died.
You must get that

1722
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:16,210
start and you will want the crowd to 
like you and then you get a healthy like

1723
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:20,080
hatred of the crowd and then an 
indifference creeps in,

1724
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:24,310
but that's where I am now.
Just total indifference.

1725
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:30,370
It's like ugly guys and girls,
ugly guys and girls have this thing 

1726
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:30,370
where they,
they love the girl,

1727
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:31,970
but the girl doesn't love them back.
So every time they see an ugly,

1728
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,460
a pretty girl,
they have this feeling of pain inside of

1729
01:15:34,461 --> 01:15:36,590
them that,
that connection with rejection.

1730
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,800
So it's not that the crowd is terrible,
it's just in the beginning we're all 

1731
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,581
terrible.
So we grow to hate the crowd because so 

1732
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:45,581
many times they punished us

1733
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:47,500
for the truth,
for the truth,

1734
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:51,280
and then we love them,
but it's not satisfying enough.

1735
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,560
Well,
we have to get good enough to be better 

1736
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:56,560
than them to sort of guide them along.

1737
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:56,880
Right?
BuT.

1738
01:15:56,881 --> 01:16:01,290
And then they're listening to my comedy 
journey.

1739
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,100
No,
I think,

1740
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,920
you know,
I honestly believe that there's a lot of

1741
01:16:04,921 --> 01:16:09,921
comics that develop this sort of hate 
for their audience and it's really 

1742
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:13,161
strange and I think the only thing that 
makes sense is they connect it with bad 

1743
01:16:13,161 --> 01:16:16,371
feelings.
They connect their audience with some 

1744
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:19,650
reflection of how they've put out their 
own energy and their own personality and

1745
01:16:19,651 --> 01:16:22,650
how people responded to that and then 
their own material,

1746
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:23,250
you know,
when,

1747
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:26,280
when,
if they've had bad sad or if they've had

1748
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:26,850
like,
you know,

1749
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,940
bad things happen in the crowd and they 
associate that,

1750
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:32,580
that bad feeling with everyone that 
comes to see them.

1751
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:35,370
And so they developed.
I've met a lot of old guys that had been

1752
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:38,550
in the business for a long time and like
I don't give a fuck with these people.

1753
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,560
One or I'm going to feed them what I do.
They like it or they don't like it and 

1754
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:43,560
the show is over.
All right folks,

1755
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,111
get the fuck outta here.
And they really do develop that sort of 

1756
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:48,111
defense mechanism.
Um,

1757
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:50,730
I try to be exactly the opposite.
I try to,

1758
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,350
I,
I buy now,

1759
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,180
I have like,
when I do shows,

1760
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,100
people come out that know me,
like it's there,

1761
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:58,440
it's my crowd.
So what?

1762
01:16:58,441 --> 01:16:59,370
It's my crowd.
It's like,

1763
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:00,810
it's way easier.
It's just like,

1764
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,980
no,
we're just going to have fun,

1765
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:02,370
you know,

1766
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,280
I feel like very open when I go out 
there and like,

1767
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,470
just like when I meet someone like in 
life,

1768
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:10,220
I give them the benefit of the doubt and
uh,

1769
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,430
and I'm,
I'm into it but it.

1770
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:17,470
But I don't,
I feel like I don't need anYthing from 

1771
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:17,470
them right now where I am.
I'm not like,

1772
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:23,140
I'm not like pleased,
laugh or please like me and I'm not 

1773
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,140
like,
I don't know.

1774
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:23,660
I don't feel scared at all.

1775
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,700
Youth as a,
as an intelligent person,

1776
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:28,550
when you were involved in this sort of a
bizarre line of work,

1777
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:33,730
there's,
there's self analysis that comes along 

1778
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:36,701
with creating new material and a lot of 
times you start looking at this weird 

1779
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:36,890
relationship that you have to this 
strange group of people.

1780
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:42,200
Like I'm seeking their approval and then
I'm doing this and I'm changing who I 

1781
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:42,200
am.
You know?

1782
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:42,200
And there's,
there's a weird,

1783
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,570
like there's a,
there's a weird thing that goes back and

1784
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:49,571
forth when you're an intelligent person 
and you're analyzing anything where you 

1785
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:51,590
sort of insisting on the approval of 
Mass amounts of people,

1786
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,800
which is what your comedy is totally 
more so than like music.

1787
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,430
Yeah.
BuT like,

1788
01:17:56,431 --> 01:17:59,820
okay,
but before you were saying about being a

1789
01:17:59,821 --> 01:18:03,420
chick and uh,
that it might limit the subject matter.

1790
01:18:03,421 --> 01:18:04,300
You Can talk about that.

1791
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,230
I did want to say limit what I said is,
makes it more difficult.

1792
01:18:07,231 --> 01:18:12,231
I think I'm more impressed when a chick 
can skirt the issues of sex or politics 

1793
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:13,080
or,
or any,

1794
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:14,960
any position of authority or,
or,

1795
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,830
or someone who makes sense.
Yeah.

1796
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:21,890
Because guys don't want to hear a girl 
makes sense that they haven't figured 

1797
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:21,890
out.

1798
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:27,200
That makes total sense.
But that's what I feel like I've been 

1799
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,111
doing like onstage about sex stuff.
I'm talking about the,

1800
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:35,720
like the girl,
the female experience and not for the 

1801
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,751
sake of shock and not for the sake of 
I'm making anybody uncomfortable or you 

1802
01:18:39,061 --> 01:18:44,061
know,
trying to belittle or alienate the 

1803
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:44,061
dudes.
It's not like that.

1804
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:44,061
I,
I,

1805
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:48,650
and I think that I've found a way to 
like make it acceptable for people to 

1806
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:48,650
digest.

1807
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:50,420
I bet you have your smart,
you can do it.

1808
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:52,530
It's not impossible,
but it is,

1809
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,620
it's more difficult

1810
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:54,550
but,
but in that way,

1811
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,510
what I'm my reason for saying that,
I was like,

1812
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:00,230
so I'm paying attention to the 
experience of the audience is having,

1813
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:02,510
like if they're not laughing and not 
with me,

1814
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:03,410
I'm not going to be like,
well,

1815
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:04,880
I don't care.
This is the path I'm on.

1816
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,220
I'm fed by that and I really react to 
it,

1817
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:09,560
but I just don't feel like,
like,

1818
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,640
uh,
you know,

1819
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:12,150
I just,
I don't know where I used to.

1820
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,870
If a joke didn't work,
I would sorta just tap dance to the next

1821
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:16,040
one and be like,
maybe this will.

1822
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:17,270
And that just,
you know,

1823
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:22,271
that I think just from bombing so hard,
so many times the fear leaves you 

1824
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:24,360
because he was lived out all your fears 
on stage.

1825
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1826
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:28,860
The moments of deep bombing

1827
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,360
right now people are like kate upton,

1828
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:36,650
but it's true the bump bombing moments 
or clarity moments.

1829
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,140
But I think that that's where people 
develop the,

1830
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,180
uh,
the bad relationship with the audience.

1831
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:46,320
I think that's,
it's like a guy with an ugly dude with 

1832
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,671
pretty girls just so used to getting 
rejected that you folk these bitches 

1833
01:19:48,671 --> 01:19:48,671
will,
you always lose,

1834
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,330
will go to a strip club.
Yeah.

1835
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,320
I think that's it.
It's a natural thing for people.

1836
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,150
I loved your,
uh,

1837
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:58,400
one of the videos that were,
are you or how you dealt with,

1838
01:19:58,401 --> 01:19:59,050
uh,
that the,

1839
01:19:59,070 --> 01:19:59,870
uh,
female heckler,

1840
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,880
um,
you,

1841
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:02,780
uh,
you were like,

1842
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:04,760
I'm not,
you just like really explained the truth

1843
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:05,120
to her.
Like,

1844
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:06,050
I'm not,
I think you were like,

1845
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,160
I'm not your boyfriend or like,
I'm not trying to fuck

1846
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,640
you.
Like you.

1847
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,830
I'm not gonna act like what you're 
saying is interesting.

1848
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:12,780
Not,
not that those were your words,

1849
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,850
but I learned.
But I learned from that.

1850
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:15,600
I was like,
oh,

1851
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:18,420
like the absolute truth is like the 
funniest shit.

1852
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,620
Like you,
you didn't like insult her whatever.

1853
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:25,290
You were just like,
here's the situation I didn't have.

1854
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,360
I was like,
you're not fascinating to me.

1855
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:32,890
Like there's an.
I'm not going to pretend like you're 

1856
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:32,890
interesting.
Like the guys that want to bang you,

1857
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,910
like just shut up.
I had a woman in vegas a couple of weeks

1858
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,700
ago that was in vegas to the one I think
you're thinking of.

1859
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,570
Which vegas?
They just go the deepest.

1860
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:42,370
Is it usually on meth or eCstasy or 
something?

1861
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:47,371
Last advil there on flying.
Flying knows what the fuck they're doing

1862
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:50,970
in vegas.
There was a girl last time were there.

1863
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,240
She stood up for like 10 minutes for 10 
minutes.

1864
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:56,070
She was like standing up in the 
audience.

1865
01:20:56,071 --> 01:21:00,170
Why I destroyed her.
Totally exaggerating on the 10 minutes,

1866
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,060
two minutes.
She was just going to the bathroom.

1867
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:08,420
But no,
she was standing up for a long time 

1868
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:08,420
screaming and yelling at me.
She was just crazy.

1869
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:09,410
She was just pretty.
And uh,

1870
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,490
you know,
and she just thought for whatever reason

1871
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:15,180
she just couldn't be running this room.
I think they're just confused.

1872
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,200
She's into coyote ugly too.
Anytime she thought she could just stand

1873
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:21,780
up and start a revolution.
Starts flair bar tending

1874
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:24,140
about

1875
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,700
somebody play devil went down to the.
Yeah.

1876
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,260
Do a little bit of this in the audience 
that night,

1877
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,470
joe.
Or it's riverdale

1878
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,070
saying,
you're like,

1879
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,590
that's not what I'm here.
For whatever reason,

1880
01:21:35,591 --> 01:21:40,591
she just really,
really wanted to be the center of 

1881
01:21:40,591 --> 01:21:43,141
attention.
So it's just caused this massive 

1882
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:43,141
commotion.
Talk to them like I talked that I like,

1883
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:44,230
I would talk to a toddler.
I'll be like,

1884
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:46,870
do you feel like you need attention 
right now?

1885
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:48,170
Yes.
That's important.

1886
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:49,750
Like,
do you need it to be from me?

1887
01:21:49,751 --> 01:21:52,800
Or maybe the people you're With at your 
table could maybe.

1888
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,390
Where does,
what led you to this deficit?

1889
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,480
Can you check this?
So looking at this one thing of 

1890
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:00,700
behavior,
what is the,

1891
01:22:00,701 --> 01:22:03,610
what is the catalyst which started this 
sauce with his childhood molestation?

1892
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:08,611
Let's talk about your dad.
Leave you somewhere and never come and 

1893
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:09,400
get you.
Or what can we do right now by dogs?

1894
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:14,420
Or I'll just like,
I'll move the mic and I'll just say 

1895
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:14,420
like,
don't talk to me anymore.

1896
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,330
And I just go back.
It's like,

1897
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:20,380
because I think the way that it is a 
struggle also for me is I go on stage,

1898
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:24,570
I look like very amish,
uh,

1899
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,600
like I look not threatening and I think 
people react even no matter what age 

1900
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,040
they are.
Like I'm a substitute teacher.

1901
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:34,960
Here we go.
Mrs randle's not here like America.

1902
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:38,780
I look like an american dollar pie.
I like apple pie.

1903
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,330
You'd have like the best tasting apple 
pie time step,

1904
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,320
right?
If I looked at her and I said,

1905
01:22:44,321 --> 01:22:46,600
that bitch is by,
we've got some awesome album and I go up

1906
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:47,990
and I'm like,
my posts either

1907
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:50,110
that.
So

1908
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:51,020
they think it's like,
you know,

1909
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,790
step teachers swipe to sort of assert my
authority right away and be like,

1910
01:22:54,791 --> 01:22:57,040
this is how this is this,
this house is going to go,

1911
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:59,260
you know,
that's hot though.

1912
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,760
I mean that.
I bet.

1913
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:06,080
I think I would have imagined that the 
guys would be or like scared

1914
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:07,120
of this guy.
I don't know.

1915
01:23:07,121 --> 01:23:10,120
I don't,
I don't get hit on very often.

1916
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:15,300
Or like if I get hit on it,
it'll be a guy coming up after the show 

1917
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,180
who will listen to my stuff and I do a 
lot of stuff up being like easy.

1918
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:21,000
So they'll,
I've had a guy come up and he just like,

1919
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:22,960
assume that they're like going home with
me.

1920
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:24,940
LIke I've,
I've had a guy come up and be like,

1921
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,290
hey,
so I'm a marine.

1922
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:30,780
And like I drove two hours to get here.
So I'm just saying,

1923
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,870
yeah,
it's safe and a knife.

1924
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:34,830
I'm like,
okay,

1925
01:23:34,831 --> 01:23:37,480
like thank you for signing the cd.
And I'm like,

1926
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:38,080
okay,
thanks.

1927
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:39,250
And he's like,
whoa,

1928
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,570
whoa,
where are we going?

1929
01:23:40,571 --> 01:23:41,770
And I'm like,
oh no,

1930
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:44,440
like you're a stranger.
Like where are we going?

1931
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:45,050
Yeah.
Or,

1932
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:50,310
But no chicks,
chicks just as much as guys aren't our 

1933
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:51,250
handsy with me and are like,
let's go somewhere.

1934
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,070
Where's the next location for jesus 
christ?

1935
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,650
Do they want to party with you or do 
they want to have sex with you?

1936
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,470
What would this church.
I hope both.

1937
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:03,550
I can only hope both girls want to hang 
out,

1938
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,380
but they're all like.
And if it's like a couple,

1939
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:07,150
they'll be like,
I don't hog amy,

1940
01:24:07,151 --> 01:24:07,880
I want eat,
you know,

1941
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,120
and they're like,
the girls are pansy.

1942
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,470
Cause you know,
they feel like,

1943
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:13,480
I'm sure everybody feels like they're 
your friend,

1944
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:17,020
they know you,
they want you to like them and they want

1945
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:18,590
you to know that they get it.

1946
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:22,180
They get so funny.
So yeah.

1947
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:23,860
So a guy.
Yeah,

1948
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,090
definitely.
I have to,

1949
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:30,300
like,
I did the show at foxwoods and this guy 

1950
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:30,300
was like,
can I,

1951
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,390
can I,
can I take a picture where I'm 

1952
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:33,520
pretending like I'm,
I'm gonna grab your boobs.

1953
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:34,180
And I was like,
whoa.

1954
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:35,470
And I was like,
no,

1955
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:37,510
um,
but let's take a normal picture.

1956
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,910
And he wrote on facebook.
He was like,

1957
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:45,660
that comment.
She left me and I wrote back to him and 

1958
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,870
I was like,
like that's the only time I ever have or

1959
01:24:47,871 --> 01:24:50,170
ever will write back to anyone who 
writes something rude to me.

1960
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:52,500
I like,
I like black,

1961
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:55,300
I like the block button on twitter,
I'm happy.

1962
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,630
But uh,
that guy,

1963
01:24:56,631 --> 01:24:59,740
I was like,
why did you feel like that was okay?

1964
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:04,741
Like I said,
let's take another picture and usually 

1965
01:25:04,741 --> 01:25:04,741
go.
Just thought you'd be like,

1966
01:25:04,741 --> 01:25:05,540
limb vanilla would have done it,
and I'm just like,

1967
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:12,720
I'm on the road by myself.
Usually like I want some inbred fucking 

1968
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,660
weirdo to be like,
oops,

1969
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:15,220
sorry.
I grabbed them by accident

1970
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:18,470
pretending to grab your tits.
How fucking crazy.

1971
01:25:18,471 --> 01:25:19,550
It's weird.
I'm just like,

1972
01:25:19,551 --> 01:25:20,850
no,
I don't want that.

1973
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:27,200
I grabbed him.
He just picked me up for a picture.

1974
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,940
I had a guy asked me if he could pick me
up.

1975
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,060
I want to feel safe.
Can I carry you?

1976
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:37,670
What did you want to do?
It kind of carry you in the picture.

1977
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:39,080
The fuck out of here,
Man.

1978
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:42,230
Why would you want to carry me?
That's so weird.

1979
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,220
Oh,
it was so weird.

1980
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,510
It was a big guy too.
I was like,

1981
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:49,511
hey,
you're like lefT to fight for that 

1982
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:53,561
position,
so let's come up with something else 

1983
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:55,750
here.
We get to the point where you're 

1984
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,750
actually carrying me.
We're going to have to.

1985
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,060
We're fighting you crazy asshole.
Trying to pick me up.

1986
01:25:56,061 --> 01:25:58,340
we'll have no boundary here.
And then what?

1987
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,890
Next thing you know,
it's never enough.

1988
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:05,980
It's never enough,
so he's another was the average person 

1989
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:09,731
would never ask.
They could pick you up and carry you 

1990
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:09,731
over.
Ask.

1991
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:13,280
Don't usually,
if it's an artist first time you've ever

1992
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:18,281
met them,
even though you know that they're a 

1993
01:26:18,281 --> 01:26:18,281
person that you've seen on television or
on a band or whatever,

1994
01:26:18,281 --> 01:26:20,190
you have just met them.
You crazy ass.

1995
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:25,290
All three seconds of facetime with you

1996
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:26,460
in,
uh,

1997
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:31,461
in sacramento.
This chick got thrown out of a show 

1998
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:33,590
because she was talking and drunk and 
loud and she got up one at the 

1999
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,590
punchline.
This is the shit.

2000
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:35,280
And she was like,
amy,

2001
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:39,330
are you going to let them do it like 
you're a stranger bitch?

2002
01:26:39,331 --> 01:26:42,510
Like she thought I was going to be no 
barbara or whatever.

2003
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:43,140
I was like,
yeah,

2004
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:46,530
get her outta here.
Crazy drunk asshole shit.

2005
01:26:46,531 --> 01:26:47,370
You're going to let them.

2006
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:50,940
I always wonder too,
when people go off in the audience,

2007
01:26:50,941 --> 01:26:53,130
so occasionally I will always wonder 
what are they on,

2008
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:58,430
you know,
in this day and age I always wonder 

2009
01:26:58,430 --> 01:26:58,440
about like,
what kind of weird prescription shit are

2010
01:26:58,441 --> 01:27:00,990
they drinking?
At the same time,

2011
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:04,660
because some people did a complete 
disconnect from reality,

2012
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,230
absolute utter disconnect from

2013
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:08,230
we are,
it'll be like,

2014
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:10,090
they're not trying to be mean,
they're trying to,

2015
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,500
like,
they think they're helping

2016
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,040
and they'll even tell you afterwards I 
helped you.

2017
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,440
I hope that show.
He went great.

2018
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,880
We were playing off of each other,
right?

2019
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,690
No,
uh,

2020
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:23,110
I had a guy,
the punchline atlanta over new year's.

2021
01:27:23,111 --> 01:27:25,930
He was like yelling and he was like,
I said something like,

2022
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,000
like,
I'm not a lesbian.

2023
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:30,610
I mean I've caught a finger but I'm not.
And so.

2024
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:33,010
And he's like,
yes you are,

2025
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:34,660
you've,
you'll fuck anybody.

2026
01:27:34,661 --> 01:27:39,661
And I,
and he and I don't think he was trying 

2027
01:27:39,661 --> 01:27:39,661
to lash out.
I think he was trying to be like,

2028
01:27:39,661 --> 01:27:40,530
I know your whatever.
Right.

2029
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:42,370
But uh,
but then everybody's like,

2030
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,200
woo.
And they put the lights on and it's like

2031
01:27:44,201 --> 01:27:47,580
they wanted me to like,
trash this guy and uh,

2032
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:50,640
so I did know,
but you know,

2033
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:55,710
it's lights on him.
They put the lights on in the crowd so 

2034
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:56,360
that you could see him there.
Yeah.

2035
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,690
Oh wow.
Did you ever ask them to do that?

2036
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,560
I don't think so.
They put the video online.

2037
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,990
It's not good.
Wait a minute.

2038
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,130
Wait.
Why did they do that?

2039
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,770
That's their solution.
Turn the lights on here.

2040
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:07,600
You can see him now.
He's the victim.

2041
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,940
You can go after him and I don't want to
do that.

2042
01:28:09,941 --> 01:28:12,310
I want to do like my,
my jokes that I'm working on.

2043
01:28:12,311 --> 01:28:17,311
You know,
that is rather not have the interaction 

2044
01:28:17,311 --> 01:28:17,311
at all.

2045
01:28:17,311 --> 01:28:17,311
Yeah.
That is a problem.

2046
01:28:17,311 --> 01:28:22,110
You know,
especially when it becomes really funny 

2047
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:22,110
too.
Then the crowd thinks it's a really good

2048
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:22,110
thing that had happened than someone 
else.

2049
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,190
Favorite part that they enjoy that look 
with the trash,

2050
01:28:24,191 --> 01:28:29,191
that fucking idiot.
So I could see how the club would be 

2051
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:29,191
like,
oh,

2052
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:32,611
this'll be fun,
but there's other clubs that won't even 

2053
01:28:32,611 --> 01:28:33,070
allow it to get to that.
I love those clubs like gotham,

2054
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:36,850
gotham polices that they don't fuck 
around that.

2055
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:40,240
Places are all ex cops running that 
fucking savages.

2056
01:28:40,241 --> 01:28:45,241
TheY grabbed you guys alone.
They are where they're waiting to 

2057
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:47,260
pounce.
Those guys are professional,

2058
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,360
New York.
Amy's.

2059
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:50,820
No.
All right.

2060
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:52,690
Well,
have a signal the other animals,

2061
01:28:52,691 --> 01:28:55,090
they don't fuck around there waiting to 
hurt someone.

2062
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,630
Those guys are beautiful places.
Perfect.

2063
01:28:58,631 --> 01:29:00,250
It's perfection.
Now you have to go there.

2064
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:02,070
Why are we like no?
You know,

2065
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,260
I love god.
I love god and that's where I started.

2066
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,680
What,
what the hell aM I doing in New York?

2067
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:08,820
Not doing that,
brian.

2068
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:10,680
What am I doing?
I remember haTton theater,

2069
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:13,830
the manhattan theater.
Fancy pants.

2070
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,230
Fancy on the bitch.
Ain't no shit

2071
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,620
Moving on up.

2072
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,820
Well,
I love doing clubs just as much.

2073
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,440
But uh,
yeah,

2074
01:29:24,441 --> 01:29:27,410
I think more someTimes even,
but to do both,

2075
01:29:27,411 --> 01:29:32,411
right?
It's when you can't do five shows or 

2076
01:29:32,411 --> 01:29:32,411
can't do like a whole weekend,
you know,

2077
01:29:32,411 --> 01:29:33,290
like thursday,
friday,

2078
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:34,730
saturday,
sunday.

2079
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:36,130
And if I can't do that,
uh,

2080
01:29:36,131 --> 01:29:38,630
I have to do like a theater.
I don't want,

2081
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:43,960
you know,
I get bummed out if I can only do like 

2082
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:43,960
one show at a town,
only 200 seats or something like that.

2083
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:46,250
but those are the best shows,
right?

2084
01:29:46,251 --> 01:29:46,630
Don't you think?

2085
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:49,070
200,
10 days because then I might fill it.

2086
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,890
You'll listen.
I'm telling you,

2087
01:29:51,891 --> 01:29:54,170
if you had a podcast,
he'd be packing clubs everywhere.

2088
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,570
I've heard you stand up.
You're fucking hilarious.

2089
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,600
Hilarious doing.
Stand up as you are rose.

2090
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,470
Thank you.
You'd be killing them.

2091
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,240
Oh my god.
A podcast.

2092
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:03,080
Yeah.
I'm tony.

2093
01:30:03,081 --> 01:30:06,290
Could step.
This is my podcast.

2094
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:08,780
I wouldn't know the first thing to say.
I'd be just start talking.

2095
01:30:08,781 --> 01:30:10,390
Start talking shit.
Or come on out.

2096
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:13,730
You could be the hole on our show.
We could introduce you.

2097
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:16,620
You could totally be my homie schubert,
aka the.

2098
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:21,710
That's squat.
Whole valentine's day.

2099
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:25,290
Yes.

2100
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,560
So beautiful.
What's beautiful?

2101
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:30,020
Because you're here.
Thank you.

2102
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:32,730
Bounce so well.
There's a fake butthole in that table.

2103
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:34,270
By the way.
We're right in front of you.

2104
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,120
You amy.
There's the little brown thing.

2105
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:39,330
No,
the little rubber thing right there.

2106
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:40,110
Oh,
this isn't.

2107
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,270
It's thanks for telling me to fake 
asshole.

2108
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:46,590
Like I would be concerned that this was 
perhaps a real asshole just had wandered

2109
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:49,290
away from it.
So this is an african americans asshole.

2110
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:54,310
Is it just because of february or switch
out the asshole when we do some porn 

2111
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:57,240
star podcast here and when girls have a 
gaping asshole,

2112
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,130
they use that to like plug it during the
day.

2113
01:30:59,131 --> 01:31:01,360
So they're assholes.
Just not like mouth breathers.

2114
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,740
Shut the phone,
you know,

2115
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:05,700
because sometimes if they get it doesn't
smell right.

2116
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:08,580
You're not tricking me with this.
You just making this up be crazy.

2117
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,820
Asshole.
Have you seen this asshole?

2118
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:12,520
No,
I have not.

2119
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:13,790
May I please?
Thank you.

2120
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,990
Enjoy.
Silly.

2121
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,070
Please enjoy.

2122
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,860
Do you know will sasso joe?
He's a very strange,

2123
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,660
very strange that someone would want to 
have in your hand.

2124
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:28,560
Yeah,
I guess.

2125
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,330
I guess when dudes just sit around 
finger and go,

2126
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:35,320
that could be her ass be somebody's.
First of all,

2127
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,280
I would brush,
brush up against her.

2128
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,360
Barely

2129
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:43,730
just letting my fingers.
Just let her know I'm here saying what's

2130
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:45,930
up?
You want to back up?

2131
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,510
You can it up.
You feel a little pressure?

2132
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:52,020
Is that your booty hole pressures?

2133
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,140
If you had the feeling to just back up 
and just.

2134
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,380
Everybody's different.
Everybody's different.

2135
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:59,990
You put your finger on some girl's 
asshole.

2136
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:01,420
So then they clamped down and go,
whoa,

2137
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,240
whoa,
whoa,

2138
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:03,940
asshole.
Every.

2139
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:05,320
Almost every guys.
Well,

2140
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,500
wouldn't you rather that than a guy back
on grab that second thing?

2141
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:11,920
I think so,
yeah.

2142
01:32:11,921 --> 01:32:13,390
You don't want a guy who's like super 
good.

2143
01:32:13,391 --> 01:32:15,320
That's how I feel today.
When you get older.

2144
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:20,370
When I get older,
I'm going to see be fisting any dude 

2145
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:20,370
that will let me.
The stoke.

2146
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:23,110
The fires were old speed board or 
whatever.

2147
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:25,120
I can in his ass.
Little brown assholes.

2148
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:28,000
Disturbing.
It might not be a total.

2149
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:31,870
I mean it's what I mean total.
I don't know.

2150
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,960
I mean that's a black asshole blast.
Just a really tan person too.

2151
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:39,730
It's not necessarily black.
No one's.

2152
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:39,970
That

2153
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,230
chick that I pulled it out of was a.
It was a black.

2154
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,910
Well thanks brian.
He didn't pull this out of some girl.

2155
01:32:45,911 --> 01:32:48,510
It was not an actual real doll play 
hole.

2156
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:51,810
It's a real dolls,
but holding version of a real downer.

2157
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,190
But isn't,
isn't a real dog.

2158
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,420
You can fuck.
It's butthole.

2159
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:59,630
Yeah.
You can pick different attachments in 

2160
01:32:59,630 --> 01:32:59,630
it.
Oh,

2161
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:02,331
you can.
But this skin is what the real dollars 

2162
01:33:02,331 --> 01:33:02,331
may not have.
Yeah,

2163
01:33:02,331 --> 01:33:02,580
that's not as good as flashlight.
No,

2164
01:33:02,581 --> 01:33:05,790
it's not.
It has a patent technology,

2165
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:06,090
joe

2166
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:09,030
the market.
Oh,

2167
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:09,970
way better.
Yeah.

2168
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:12,630
Fleshlight feels way closer to vagina.

2169
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:13,550
Yeah,
absolutely.

2170
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:14,120
Pretty good.
Close.

2171
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:17,720
That's why you get you buy any kind of 
fake vagina as a guy and it's like,

2172
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,390
it's a joke.
It's like fucking a barbie doll chunk.

2173
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,690
Like that data piece where they make 
barbie dolls out of like the carpet in a

2174
01:33:23,691 --> 01:33:24,280
certain way.
That's what it.

2175
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:29,310
It feels like.
Can you make the fleshlight tighter if 

2176
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:29,310
you want?

2177
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:31,180
Yeah,
it was pretty tight.

2178
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,980
It just stretches around your dick.

2179
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:34,960
Yeah.

2180
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:36,410
Okay.
Do you know what I mean?

2181
01:33:36,411 --> 01:33:39,120
So for the most part,
most people are

2182
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:40,570
imagine.
Maybe,

2183
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,720
maybe not.
Oh,

2184
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:44,950
thank you everyone.
We meet me.

2185
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:46,720
Wow.
This is great.

2186
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,180
Very touchy subject with men and women.
Oh yeah.

2187
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:51,580
The asshole.
China's something taken over.

2188
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,040
Some artificial shit for,
for years.

2189
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:59,041
Dudes.
How to live with girls riding equipment 

2190
01:33:59,041 --> 01:33:59,170
and stick and sedans inside of their 
bodies.

2191
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:05,030
And now it's your turn.
Now it's finally you're the men sexual 

2192
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:05,710
revolution.
Turn around right now.

2193
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:08,500
I wasn't scared of all that shit.
I've never dealt with any of that.

2194
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:13,530
I mean I've had a vibrator,
but how do you feel about this crazy 

2195
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:13,530
rick santorum,
asshole.

2196
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,940
Not to like skew your judgement in any 
way you thought.

2197
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:16,780
Maybe I'd be like,
whoa,

2198
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:17,520
whoa,
whoa,

2199
01:34:17,521 --> 01:34:18,070
whoa,
whoa,

2200
01:34:18,071 --> 01:34:18,850
whoa,
whoa.

2201
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:23,230
I love santorum now.
Apparently like he's not even into birth

2202
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:28,231
control.
He thinks that women shouldn't have 

2203
01:34:28,231 --> 01:34:30,811
birth control and that the states should
be able to decide whether that was my 

2204
01:34:30,811 --> 01:34:31,690
way of saying you're pulling out and 
putting it all over his wife's stomach.

2205
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:36,710
Yes.
Because you thInk he's a tech guy or do 

2206
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:36,710
you think.
I don't believe that he feels like that.

2207
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:41,491
He believes anything that he's saying.
You feel like he's just completely to 

2208
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:42,220
plan a game,
don't.

2209
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,710
what do you think it could be gay.
He just go straight to fat.

2210
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,730
Yeah.
When I went over.

2211
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:51,840
So it's really religious bears.
When someone's super,

2212
01:34:51,841 --> 01:34:54,400
super religious and they want to lie,
like

2213
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,970
they want to either challenge gay 
marrIage or control gay or whenever they

2214
01:34:58,971 --> 01:35:02,720
want to get real freaky with like 
controlling sex and morality issues like

2215
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:04,280
that.
I almost always go gay with them.

2216
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:08,690
Almost always one are uncovered as being
wildly gay.

2217
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:11,540
Yeah.
It sounds like a crazy thing to say.

2218
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:12,560
Like,
you know joe rogan,

2219
01:35:12,561 --> 01:35:13,670
you're an asshole for saying that.
No,

2220
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:18,671
I'm not.
You know why I'll tell you why because 

2221
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:20,920
I'm not.
I'm not saying that you shouldn't be 

2222
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:20,920
religious.
I'm not saying that.

2223
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,010
I know a lot of people were all that is 
super benefited them,

2224
01:35:22,011 --> 01:35:24,350
especially people that have had 
substance abuse issues.

2225
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:29,650
You cannot say that christianity or 
religion and having a good church and a 

2226
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:31,040
good association of community 
association to that belong to.

2227
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:33,650
That's religious and false religious 
tenants that it couldn't help.

2228
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:34,750
They're like,
yeah,

2229
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,380
but for,
you know,

2230
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,870
for a lot of people they're just too 
fucking stupid.

2231
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,070
Yeah.
It gives somebody hope and it helps them

2232
01:35:42,071 --> 01:35:42,580
out.
I'm like,

2233
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:43,330
god,
do it,

2234
01:35:43,331 --> 01:35:48,331
but,
but if it's just because you're 

2235
01:35:48,331 --> 01:35:48,790
borderline retarded and somebody told 
you to believe it and you do,

2236
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:52,990
then I guess I don't really know what 
I'm saying.

2237
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:54,940
What do you saying?
I don't know.

2238
01:35:54,941 --> 01:35:55,770
I just think,
um,

2239
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:58,540
I don't want to blame the pot,
but uh,

2240
01:35:58,541 --> 01:36:00,850
I just like don't even really remember 
what we're talking.

2241
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:04,730
Do you like the breadsticks and salad at
olive garden?

2242
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,140
Brian?
You had to.

2243
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,360
Is that what we were talking about when 
you're there you are talking about black

2244
01:36:10,361 --> 01:36:10,700
eyes.

2245
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,490
Oh yeah.
You guys.

2246
01:36:12,491 --> 01:36:13,040
I'll tell you later.

2247
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:18,010
Personal threeway mind stump right 
there.

2248
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,630
We were driving and we were following 
you.

2249
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,950
You will that we.
Yeah,

2250
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,770
because there was a brIef moment where 
I,

2251
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:25,240
I,
w,

2252
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:26,730
you know,
as you having a conversation,

2253
01:36:26,731 --> 01:36:28,710
it's sorta like you tossing a ball back 
and forth to each other.

2254
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,800
I took them off.
You have the ball and I completely 

2255
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,270
forgot what I was saying.
When I gave you the ball in the sewer,

2256
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,520
you,
you sort of threw the ball back to me 

2257
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:40,520
and I am like,
I'm not sure you can have it again.

2258
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,510
And then you said,
I don't know what we're talking about.

2259
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,410
Just like,
damn,

2260
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:46,350
I should have kept that ball and I 
wasn't paying attention.

2261
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,720
Yeah.
Brian's like watching reruns of stanford

2262
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:50,940
and you don't want to be the koby bryant
of podcasts.

2263
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:53,280
You want to push the ball off as much as
possible.

2264
01:36:53,281 --> 01:36:54,480
It's very important.
Yeah.

2265
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:56,550
It's a beautiful moments.
Rape joke.

2266
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:58,980
I'm gonna.
Opt out.

2267
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:01,530
Do I love you?
I love you.

2268
01:37:01,531 --> 01:37:04,350
Move here.
Move here.

2269
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,330
Come on.
We're going to be besties.

2270
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,240
I stopped doing my rape joke.
I can't do it anymore.

2271
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:11,910
People were getting mad in the audience 
that had been raped.

2272
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:13,110
Yeah.
You should not be.

2273
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,980
That's not a funny thing to talk about.
It's like murdering babies is not fun to

2274
01:37:16,981 --> 01:37:17,940
talk about either.
Yeah.

2275
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,650
They don't have to tell you.
I beg to differ

2276
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,590
subjects.
I just.

2277
01:37:22,591 --> 01:37:25,110
I can't.
I can't find a way to make cancer funny,

2278
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:26,550
but everything else I think is pretty

2279
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:27,680
well.
It depends.

2280
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,930
It depends on who's getting raped when 
dudes are getting raped.

2281
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:30,860
It's hilarious.
That's great.

2282
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:33,650
Especially assholes.
What a bad rape.

2283
01:37:33,651 --> 01:37:36,690
I mean men are getting raped by other 
meaner men.

2284
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:38,630
Song sister,
right?

2285
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:43,010
For that reason.
That was the rape.

2286
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:44,360
I was like,
yes.

2287
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:49,470
Laska rape show on television was odd.
They don't make them like based and 

2288
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:50,540
that's a different way of owning a guy 
raping them.

2289
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:55,100
That's a whole other level raping 
someone when you're in a cage together,

2290
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,240
like they just

2291
01:37:56,550 --> 01:38:01,550
impose themselves on you so much that 
they sexually impose themselves on and 

2292
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:02,150
they make you suck their dick.
Oh,

2293
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:05,420
they not in your mouth.
They didn't even.

2294
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,950
They just wanted to show you that they 
could do that.

2295
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,990
Few.
Imagine how horrific that must be.

2296
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:12,560
The [inaudible].
The moment you become a fiction,

2297
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,620
it's what you want it to happen,
but what if you.

2298
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:18,270
You have to got beats the fuck out of 
you.

2299
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:21,540
The best way to not get the fuck beat 
out of you is to suck as deck.

2300
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:26,541
Let them fucking yes.
Not going to take that much tIme out of 

2301
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:26,541
your day.
Tibet and rape ceremonies.

2302
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:32,370
Yeah.
Your tie you to a stick and a bunch of 

2303
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:32,760
guys that raped free tibet means betting
that up.

2304
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:39,390
I'm getting that bumper sticker meeting.
Meeting adjourned.

2305
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:40,000
He's actually

2306
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:43,420
and saying a tibetan.
I'm a vulture,

2307
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,630
vulture funeral funeral where they tie 
you.

2308
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,180
You're dead body to a stake and then the
vultures come down and eat you.

2309
01:38:48,181 --> 01:38:51,750
It's fucking wild and watches like your 
family members,

2310
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:56,890
your family in.
a lot of times the voltage will leave 

2311
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:57,540
the head on last,
so a lot of the photos of you see it.

2312
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:02,690
It's just like a skeleton,
like almost at exactly from disneyland 

2313
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:02,950
and then a person's real head attached 
to extend.

2314
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:08,060
Not only the high level guys,
the high level guys take it to the next 

2315
01:39:08,131 --> 01:39:12,480
level and they bring haMmers and then 
they smash up the head and they smash up

2316
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:17,481
the bones and then they step back again.
The vultures come back and they'll 

2317
01:39:17,481 --> 01:39:20,580
acTually devour the smashed up bones.
That's when you're taking a deep.

2318
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:25,990
That's when you're taking it super deep.
When you're hitting your friend's head 

2319
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,910
open with a fucking hammer and they 
opened them up to at knives.

2320
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:32,010
They're like,
open the meet up to get the vultures to 

2321
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:32,550
start.
I was actually talking to this mom.

2322
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:37,790
I'm on the phone with my mom and now 
he's telling her about why didn't my 

2323
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:37,890
suspicious that you're telling a lie?
No.

2324
01:39:37,891 --> 01:39:40,350
I said,
I will call.

2325
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:45,680
I will call her,
I'll call her right now live if you 

2326
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:45,680
don't believe me,
but no,

2327
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,351
I swear to god I was driving over 
telling her about this and then she's 

2328
01:39:48,351 --> 01:39:48,351
like,
you know,

2329
01:39:48,351 --> 01:39:51,770
this is like the most disturbing thing 
my mom's ever heard in her life because 

2330
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:53,220
she doesn't have like internet as much 
as people,

2331
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:58,221
you know,
so like I'm telling her this and she's 

2332
01:39:58,221 --> 01:39:58,221
like,
I have to sit down.

2333
01:39:58,221 --> 01:39:59,790
Really just the idea of tolerance you 
did today on the way here.

2334
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,560
Oh,
you should tell her to fucking go to the

2335
01:40:01,561 --> 01:40:04,410
link to make it go to the line and then 
just email it to her.

2336
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:06,150
Hey mom,
this is new place.

2337
01:40:06,151 --> 01:40:07,550
I'm thinking about moving into.
We're back.

2338
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:09,600
What do you think?
And she'll just look at that length.

2339
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:10,950
She sounds like a real bitch.

2340
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,060
I think she's spotting.

2341
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,950
Say that while you're wearing your 
cougar mentor.

2342
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:23,370
I could sent it.
Cool to you.

2343
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:26,790
Do you remember the cougar in,
in austin?

2344
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:27,870
Austin,
Texas.

2345
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:29,700
Uh,
you know,

2346
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,380
the accidental cougar?
Oh yeah,

2347
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:33,690
yeah.
Do you want to tell that story?

2348
01:40:33,691 --> 01:40:35,520
No,
I think we've told a million times,

2349
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:37,980
but pretty much are you,
are you talking about the strip club?

2350
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:39,750
Yeah,
the one when you didn't know.

2351
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:45,570
So there is this waitress that was 
really flirty with me at the strip club 

2352
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:47,130
and I was blackout drunk and you're 
like,

2353
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:48,380
he wants me to get jealous.
Yeah,

2354
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:49,320
yeah.
Well he is,

2355
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:54,910
you know,
she wasn't enough and don't worry about 

2356
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:54,910
it,

2357
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:58,310
but she was pretty high.
She was pretty hot though.

2358
01:40:58,311 --> 01:41:03,311
And so she was like being really flirty,
like massaging my back and everything 

2359
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:06,581
like that and I was just wasted.
And then she stopped massaging my back 

2360
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:10,031
and I'm just fucked up.
And then suddenly this other waitress 

2361
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:13,190
comes up to me or a stripper or I don't 
know who it was or just an older lady.

2362
01:41:13,191 --> 01:41:14,710
She was a patron,
a patron.

2363
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:17,810
I was just like an old lady that he hung
out at strip clubs,

2364
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:20,020
you know,
like creepy older ladies.

2365
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:23,870
They smoke cigarettes and I don't know,
like face of an ugly angel.

2366
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:26,890
And uh,
and she,

2367
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:31,930
I thought that was this girl tried to 
kiss me on the cheek or something like 

2368
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:35,471
that.
And I thought it was that hot waitress 

2369
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:37,350
and I just closed my eyes and just 
started like frenching her and then 

2370
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:39,050
joe's recording it on his phone.
And then,

2371
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:41,390
I don't know,
it was this way before.

2372
01:41:41,391 --> 01:41:44,420
You could record things in your.
No you do because I recorded it on a,

2373
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:45,070
on a,
on a,

2374
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:49,420
on a camera camera camera.
He recorded on the camera and then then,

2375
01:41:49,421 --> 01:41:51,050
um,
a whatever.

2376
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:55,330
I like backed out and notice it wasn't 
hurting everyone that was around me look

2377
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:57,500
like a ghost.
LIke everyone was just like,

2378
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:58,360
why does it go?

2379
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:00,450
What?
It was like,

2380
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:04,500
it was october and brian was happy as a 
pig in shit.

2381
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:08,990
He was sitting back with his arms 
stretched pie.

2382
01:42:08,991 --> 01:42:11,370
I'm drunk,
stoned as fuck.

2383
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:16,580
He's just oblivious to the world.
And he had this huge smile on his face 

2384
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:19,060
and then the waitress comes over and she
was really cute and brian said something

2385
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:24,070
funny.
He laughed and he clapped his hands 

2386
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:24,070
together and we were all having a good 
time.

2387
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:29,200
And brian kicks back and he's literally,
he's so hammered and like fucking 

2388
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:34,041
nickelback is playing really loud.
His head is leaning Back and the girl 

2389
01:42:34,711 --> 01:42:39,450
comes over and kisses his cheek and 
she's a fucking old biker lady.

2390
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:44,510
Like an old roast.
She had short chyna,

2391
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:47,650
golden girls.
the older one that was the.

2392
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:50,700
The cougar.
She was wearing a vance.

2393
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:55,470
Blanche blanche.
She seems like the cutest one.

2394
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:57,810
anyway,
so she was.

2395
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,340
She was.
She was like late,

2396
01:42:59,430 --> 01:43:01,990
late fifties,
right when you say late,

2397
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:04,230
late,
late fifties.

2398
01:43:04,231 --> 01:43:08,010
Old biker lady sits down next to brian.
Cuddles with them,

2399
01:43:08,011 --> 01:43:11,220
rubs up agaInst him.
He like puts his hand on her.

2400
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:15,510
She kisses his neck,
he turns to her and it's like watching a

2401
01:43:15,511 --> 01:43:17,220
deer get hit by a train.

2402
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:25,260
Oh my god.
It was horrendous when she stuck out her

2403
01:43:25,261 --> 01:43:27,900
weathered cigarette,
great tongue.

2404
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:31,970
It was like a fucking appendage and in 
the movie predator it was like something

2405
01:43:31,971 --> 01:43:36,971
you expect come out of it's mouth.
She was tongue and brian and oh,

2406
01:43:37,491 --> 01:43:40,620
it's so nasty.
And wHatever tattoos that she had on her

2407
01:43:40,621 --> 01:43:43,740
head long been ballooned by the mother 
time.

2408
01:43:43,741 --> 01:43:47,220
TaSmanian devil shooting a basketball or
something.

2409
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,110
Oh,
they were making out.

2410
01:43:48,150 --> 01:43:49,780
They were making out and I'm filming 
this,

2411
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:50,910
I'm filming it,
and I'm going,

2412
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,040
look,
what

2413
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,590
the fuck is brian?
So the video is like,

2414
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,870
look,
look what the fuck his brains doing.

2415
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:59,320
Hear me.
You know?

2416
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,040
It's like,
yeah,

2417
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:02,840
and then the next day I'm like,
dude,

2418
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:03,830
did you get that video?
And goes,

2419
01:44:03,831 --> 01:44:05,330
dude,
I deleted it for you.

2420
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:13,780
We watched it.
I knew that it was too good and it was 

2421
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:15,260
going to get out.
I knew it was devastating.

2422
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:19,520
It would have been devastated.
I would love to see no today.

2423
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:21,260
I agree.
But eight years ago,

2424
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:22,540
whenever the fuck it was,
I,

2425
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:24,350
I say you weren't really ready for that 
yet.

2426
01:44:24,351 --> 01:44:26,040
I would love to.
It would have been devastated.

2427
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:30,740
I had that on my fucking mind.
You'd wake up and shit,

2428
01:44:30,741 --> 01:44:33,300
your pants and cold sweats.
You just wake up thinking about it.

2429
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:34,930
JusT shit your pants.
Oh,

2430
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:39,760
that woman was horrific.
That would be so awesome to have seen in

2431
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:41,330
the shining.
When jack nicholas says,

2432
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:43,440
making out with the woman at all.
So it turns into an old lady out,

2433
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,470
oh,
that's what it was like,

2434
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:45,880
huh?

2435
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:49,820
That's sad that you did little buddy,
you know I love.

2436
01:44:49,821 --> 01:44:51,440
You know I want to.
I want to see.

2437
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,460
I didn't want to see it again.
I went almost reenact it,

2438
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:57,380
live with it.
I felt bad.

2439
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,510
I felt bad.
Everybody was going to attack you.

2440
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:04,010
I'm on a cougar hunt show.
You're just here to protect him.

2441
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:10,510
She was a snuffaluffagus rocker chick 
trying to ruin my game with the cougar,

2442
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:18,680
but there's somewhere out there.
There's someone who wants to suck her 

2443
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:18,680
feet.
Yeah.

2444
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,400
There's some dude who wants to suck 
those.

2445
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:24,430
DrIed out.
Old fucking calloused heart and cracked 

2446
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:25,160
feet.
He wants to suck on them.

2447
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:26,600
There's somebody out there,
man.

2448
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:28,310
hey man.
Pretty nice.

2449
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:34,060
Was that like,
was that like hispanic or like bread?

2450
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:39,080
Like southern southern guy.
So awful.

2451
01:45:41,970 --> 01:45:46,970
Have you seen the book of mormon?
Do you go to like plays and stuff like 

2452
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:46,970
that?
Is it.

2453
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:47,160
Is it just amazing?
It's coming here to los angeles.

2454
01:45:47,161 --> 01:45:48,390
Finally,
for folks who don't know,

2455
01:45:48,391 --> 01:45:50,670
it's the matt stone and trey parker.
A musical.

2456
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:53,190
Awesome.
It's coming to los angeles.

2457
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:57,630
I think so how the fuck those guys have 
time to do that?

2458
01:45:57,631 --> 01:45:59,150
Man,
that's ridiculous.

2459
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:03,420
There's some people that like put out 
like the workload is just.

2460
01:46:03,421 --> 01:46:03,980
It's.
So

2461
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:08,020
you're one of those 85,
you're like jamaican.

2462
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:09,550
No,
these easy jobs.

2463
01:46:09,551 --> 01:46:14,551
Everything I have,
I figured out a way to just to fake it 

2464
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:19,740
crest on,
on crest secret.

2465
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:25,510
Super manly,
rugged fucking fucking fucking.

2466
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:32,810
Just everything I do.

2467
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:39,390
It's super easy.
It's all like skating through.

2468
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:44,420
I Mean comedy is the only thing that's 
difficult because you have to write 

2469
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:44,420
material,
but then once you got it down,

2470
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:45,810
once you have your set down,
it's super easy.

2471
01:46:45,811 --> 01:46:48,540
You know that they're really.
The only difficult thing about comedy is

2472
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:49,500
writing new stuff

2473
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:52,540
on the shit that the travel,
but that's just.

2474
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,200
I'm telling you,
your travel will be so much different if

2475
01:46:55,201 --> 01:47:00,201
you had a podcast and bring your friends
just hanging out in California,

2476
01:47:02,191 --> 01:47:04,830
smoke a lot of weed and just do shows 
here locally.

2477
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,080
Do podcasts.
Yeah,

2478
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:09,510
come on,
get in there,

2479
01:47:09,511 --> 01:47:14,511
girl.
This is a scene in the movie we decided 

2480
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:16,870
that fucking New York,
New York can suck it and you throw all 

2481
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:20,151
your stuff in a bag and that's what I'm 
saying right before you leave New York 

2482
01:47:20,151 --> 01:47:20,930
and he kicked the door.
Shut up,

2483
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:26,110
listen your plane.
Next thing you landed like in the movie 

2484
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:29,071
snatch you.
Remember when the dude has to fly back 

2485
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:29,071
and forth from london to New York.
I'm so mad.

2486
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:31,110
I got some fucking diamond deal that's 
going on and pop.

2487
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:35,370
Sammy the pretty women,
but like in reverse,

2488
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:39,460
so like a month from now I'll just be 
like a hooker pants list straight.

2489
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,740
Like,
no,

2490
01:47:40,741 --> 01:47:45,741
I don't need money.
I don't need money or the greyhound 

2491
01:47:45,741 --> 01:47:45,741
station is,
but it really.

2492
01:47:45,741 --> 01:47:45,741
I'm like,
okay,

2493
01:47:45,741 --> 01:47:48,630
can I have some money to the street in 
my underpants?

2494
01:47:48,631 --> 01:47:52,770
Just state your brown.
When I first joined to New York,

2495
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,390
I'm not going to start shitting myself,
brian,

2496
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:56,160
jesus christ.
I'm just not.

2497
01:47:56,161 --> 01:47:58,350
I don't have a job.
I remember when I first got to New York,

2498
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:00,810
there was an area of New York,
uh,

2499
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,270
jimmy norton would know where it is.
He'd be able to share it.

2500
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:06,200
I'm sure he knows where it moved to.
He probably does.

2501
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:09,660
There's an area that was like near the 
shipyards and shit.

2502
01:48:09,661 --> 01:48:14,661
It was like a real creepy area and you 
drive through and there was hookers 

2503
01:48:14,661 --> 01:48:16,110
everywhere.
It was like night of the booker.

2504
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:21,150
It was 42nd.
Although seattle,

2505
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:26,010
seattle,
again inside jokes.

2506
01:48:26,011 --> 01:48:28,470
This motherfucker with the inside jokes 
there was.

2507
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:33,970
It was so bizarre because it was like,
like it was only shipyards and hookers 

2508
01:48:35,161 --> 01:48:36,630
everywhere.
It was a dream.

2509
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:41,660
Really weird village.
People are actually there that that's 

2510
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:41,660
that.
That's a real place.

2511
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:43,410
There's a lot of people that have never 
experienced that.

2512
01:48:43,411 --> 01:48:45,340
They don't know if there's spots where 
they.

2513
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:49,050
There was all these,
they've decided hookers or just going to

2514
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:54,710
amsterdam,
like on a streets in new orleans is the 

2515
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:59,091
scariest place like that that I've for 
hookers really from what I've seen and I

2516
01:49:00,571 --> 01:49:02,160
went to college in baltimore,
like I saw some,

2517
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:07,370
some shit for sure,
but new orleans I saw the scariest shit 

2518
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:10,221
I've ever seen with hookers and stuff.
I would've never thought that baltimore 

2519
01:49:10,221 --> 01:49:12,050
was like a hardcore sort of a place like
the wire.

2520
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,420
The wire is real.
Are you going to New York?

2521
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:18,360
I grew up in New York and as in the city
constantly.

2522
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:22,080
Nothing ever happened in Baltimore.
I got robbed every way imaginable.

2523
01:49:22,081 --> 01:49:25,020
My car held up at gunpoint.
Our apartments.

2524
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:27,080
Christ like.
Yeah,

2525
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,130
it's fucking.
It was nuts there.

2526
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:32,610
I don't know if it's better now,
but I love baltimore,

2527
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,070
but it's.
You don't want to go to central booking.

2528
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,080
Yeah.
Baltimore.

2529
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:39,270
They used to have a comedy club there.
You start in improv.

2530
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,040
Do you remember doing.
Oh,

2531
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:42,940
speaking of that.
Oh shit.

2532
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:47,870
He's in baltimore this sunday.
I think it's called the comedy factor.

2533
01:49:47,871 --> 01:49:49,060
Yeah,
I remember that.

2534
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:51,120
I just remembered that.
Yes,

2535
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:56,170
We're a Washington dc ass.
I was just saying like,

2536
01:49:56,171 --> 01:49:57,660
don't go to baltimore and like,
fuck,

2537
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:01,100
I'm going there this sunday and shot at 
and don't forget this.

2538
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,410
You want to see my comedic?
Yeah,

2539
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:03,650
stylings.
Oh yeah,

2540
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:05,700
so you're going to be wearing baltimore 
the sunday.

2541
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:09,260
I think it's called the comedy factory 
at.

2542
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:10,740
Is that the old improv?

2543
01:50:12,090 --> 01:50:13,350
It's like,
right.

2544
01:50:13,351 --> 01:50:15,540
If it's not in the actual spaces right 
next to it,

2545
01:50:15,630 --> 01:50:16,870
that's where the improv used to be.
Yeah,

2546
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:19,250
because I know the power plant,
so yeah,

2547
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,370
that was a fun last spot.
That was fun.

2548
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:26,530
That was coming up when I was in school 
and we were just little horrors one 

2549
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:26,590
around there.
That's what it seems like.

2550
01:50:26,591 --> 01:50:30,480
It's a block away from gay street,
which is like the strip club porn.

2551
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:34,260
That was fun.
Fun place to go to college for sure.

2552
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:35,970
That's where a boy,
john rollo is.

2553
01:50:35,971 --> 01:50:38,130
Shout out to john rollo.
Listens to the podcast.

2554
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:43,131
He's from baltimore.
We got john rollo to weird accent that 

2555
01:50:43,131 --> 01:50:43,131
baltimore accent.
so fucking.

2556
01:50:43,131 --> 01:50:44,490
It's sort of city,
but it's sorta country.

2557
01:50:44,491 --> 01:50:47,980
It's not cute.
It ain't cute.

2558
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,080
Do you think it's bad?
Just kidding.

2559
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:50,220
Please come out sunday.

2560
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:56,730
Everything you do is art.
Everything you do is our miracle.

2561
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:00,030
Come out sunday.
My elbow support me.

2562
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,860
Do you have an album?
Yeah.

2563
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,610
How can people get it?
Itunes,

2564
01:51:03,730 --> 01:51:05,350
itunes.
It's called cutting.

2565
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:06,580
Cutting.
Oh,

2566
01:51:06,581 --> 01:51:09,370
nice.
I love the album cover.

2567
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:11,600
I might buy right now,
but that.

2568
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:12,330
Okay.
How about.

2569
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,960
What's that about?
Buy my album,

2570
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:15,340
the album covers.
Awesome.

2571
01:51:15,341 --> 01:51:20,341
What is it?
It's her baking cupcakes and she has a 

2572
01:51:20,341 --> 01:51:20,890
black guy.
She's dressed up like,

2573
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:25,920
oh,
this is the one where the lady didn't 

2574
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:25,920
want to do the makeup.
She didn't want to do that.

2575
01:51:26,230 --> 01:51:28,880
Wow.
Because she thought that you're.

2576
01:51:28,881 --> 01:51:31,390
You're making fun of violence?
I think so,

2577
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:36,391
but like that's my favorite thing to do.
Like my sister and I used to go to 

2578
01:51:36,391 --> 01:51:38,980
rangers games and I would wear it brace 
and I'd put two black eyes on her and 

2579
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,390
people be like,
what happened?

2580
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:39,930
I'd be like,
oh,

2581
01:51:39,931 --> 01:51:43,170
we got into sewing with each other.
It's awesome people.

2582
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:45,180
One time we saw jon hamm,
like,

2583
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:50,550
oh,
we forgot that we had fucked ourselves 

2584
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:50,550
up and he was staring at us.
We were like,

2585
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:51,330
john,
he was into our shit and then we're,

2586
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:55,040
we're all your feet the fuck up.
Yeah.

2587
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:56,970
We get worse and worse.
Every game.

2588
01:51:57,180 --> 01:52:00,810
Like we would try if we got our hands in
crutches and we would do anything.

2589
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:06,260
We just thought it was so fucking funny.
People were horrified by us.

2590
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,120
Is that okay?
Got you into stand up comedy,

2591
01:52:08,121 --> 01:52:10,160
like just be a joker like that.
I think so.

2592
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:11,690
I've been a dick,
had my whole life.

2593
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:15,260
I've been a worthless dick my whole 
life.

2594
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:18,620
I always had saturday detention.
Did you have that?

2595
01:52:18,621 --> 01:52:20,030
You know,
like the breakfast club shit?

2596
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:25,400
Yeah,
it was me and all the kids that didn't 

2597
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:25,400
speak english.
I didn't have,

2598
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,330
we didn't have saturday detention and 
regular detention all the time.

2599
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:27,770
Yeah.
Did you,

2600
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:31,490
did you make it snow like from your 
dandruff onto a picture?

2601
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,080
Do.
I don't know.

2602
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:36,630
Andrew fund to a picture.
You dirty tickets.

2603
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,960
I'm not going to move here anymore.
That I was talking about the fiscal 

2604
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,930
february that you know,
we were there on saturday.

2605
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:52,420
Important to you and nobody else.
I have no idea what a fucking alisha,

2606
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,070
alisha,
alisha for.

2607
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:57,040
Yeah.
You remember she used to like,

2608
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,180
she was the of your hair and make it 
snow.

2609
01:52:59,650 --> 01:53:01,160
Uh,
because of our direction.

2610
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:03,490
It was like go as disturbing thing for 
that movie.

2611
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:05,820
That was the dandruff.
Like I think she.

2612
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:11,150
Yeah.
And it was a joke that was snowing on a 

2613
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:11,150
house that she drew or something.
Oh,

2614
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:13,520
I'll show you that.
That part,

2615
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:18,610
I don't remember that.
I don't think that was important plot 

2616
01:53:18,610 --> 01:53:21,410
point.
I don't know if I actually watched that 

2617
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:21,410
whole movie all the way through.

2618
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:25,460
Yeah,
that's one of those movies I probably 

2619
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:26,751
watched like 20 minutes and then shut it
off and then went back and watched the 

2620
01:53:26,751 --> 01:53:26,770
other 20 minutes.
Another time.

2621
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:28,310
I probably never finished it.
you don't,

2622
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:29,910
you don't like those movies?
I don't know.

2623
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:34,920
It's never ended them.
They used to frustrate me when I was a 

2624
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:35,220
kid when I was a kid,
when those movies were coming out.

2625
01:53:35,221 --> 01:53:40,221
All those 16 candles is a very weird 
time in my life because I,

2626
01:53:40,301 --> 01:53:45,301
I would get annoyed at any,
any like feel good.

2627
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:48,870
Like I,
if I saw where it was going,

2628
01:53:48,871 --> 01:53:50,940
I couldn't enjoy it.
I had to like,

2629
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:55,970
I,
I couldn't enjoy any sort of a horse 

2630
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:55,970
shit.
Sort of

2631
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:58,800
happy ending any kind of movement it was
concocted.

2632
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:01,050
Those movies had some really dark shit 
though,

2633
01:54:01,230 --> 01:54:02,310
I'm sure.
Really?

2634
01:54:02,370 --> 01:54:03,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

2635
01:54:03,930 --> 01:54:05,290
The guy,
the guy that was right.

2636
01:54:05,330 --> 01:54:10,330
but I mean like I just,
if you saw like the happy ending coming 

2637
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:10,330
at you,
if I saw any,

2638
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:14,730
if I just felt like it was written,
I felt like I was just like really 

2639
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:14,730
super,
super critical to the writing.

2640
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:14,730
Yeah,
I could,

2641
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:20,060
I wouldn'T,
wouldn't even leave and enjoyed like 

2642
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:20,060
comic book movies

2643
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:20,160
back then.
But that movie is like a.

2644
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,380
And you're the nerd and you're the,
you know,

2645
01:54:22,381 --> 01:54:23,450
it was very.
Yeah,

2646
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:24,540
it was really like,
yeah,

2647
01:54:24,541 --> 01:54:27,090
this is the bad boy.
The bad boy.

2648
01:54:27,091 --> 01:54:32,091
Like in that movie,
his dad was like putting cigarettes out 

2649
01:54:32,091 --> 01:54:32,091
on him and it was.
Right.

2650
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:32,970
Well That's.
Yeah,

2651
01:54:32,971 --> 01:54:35,310
that is really talented girl.
Molly ringwald was like,

2652
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:40,910
yeah,
like I remember thinking it was really 

2653
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:40,910
dark out.
She was kind of vilified just for having

2654
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:45,501
tits.
Like she was doing something to 

2655
01:54:45,501 --> 01:54:45,540
everybody just by having boobs.
Oh,

2656
01:54:45,541 --> 01:54:46,980
here's,
maybe if I saw it again,

2657
01:54:46,981 --> 01:54:48,300
it just showed him like.
But I was,

2658
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:48,990
I just remember.

2659
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:54,190
So I,
I had really like super critical taste 

2660
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:54,190
back then.
It was a what?

2661
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:54,660
Yeah.
What did you like?

2662
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:57,420
Why would.
I was very critical about myself at this

2663
01:54:57,660 --> 01:55:02,660
point in my life and so I was really 
critical about like everything I saw on 

2664
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,200
tv and the movies.
It was just a weird time for me.

2665
01:55:04,201 --> 01:55:04,860
I was like,
oh,

2666
01:55:04,861 --> 01:55:06,270
the movie fucking sucks.

2667
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:08,640
Were you like a comedy nerd?
Nick did you know

2668
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:12,930
I became a comedian before that.
I was the only.

2669
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:15,790
I was a richard pryor nerd,
you know,

2670
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,700
we'd listen to richard pryor tapes.
So my girlfriend.

2671
01:55:17,701 --> 01:55:18,780
Yeah.
But then,

2672
01:55:18,790 --> 01:55:19,380
uh,
uh,

2673
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:24,920
I,
I really started doing it because I'm 

2674
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:25,980
friends talked me into it and because 
somebody described to me sam kennison,

2675
01:55:26,230 --> 01:55:31,230
the first sam kinison bid that I ever 
heard was done for me by a girl in 19 

2676
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:31,230
year old girl

2677
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:32,580
I know worked with,
you know,

2678
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,640
I don't know why I know this story,
but I do know the story.

2679
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:38,520
I should've just pretended like I didn't
know.

2680
01:55:38,730 --> 01:55:41,630
I probably told him on the podcast.
So you must have told him on the toilet.

2681
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,300
Sorry,
brian.

2682
01:55:42,810 --> 01:55:43,560
I,
we did.

2683
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:43,860
Yeah.

2684
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:46,910
Even hearing in the parking lot.
Yeah.

2685
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:48,260
Yeah.
She was.

2686
01:55:48,261 --> 01:55:48,710
So,
it was.

2687
01:55:48,711 --> 01:55:51,240
So it was such a funny bit that this 
girl wasn't even a comedian,

2688
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:53,280
did the bit in the parking lot.
I was like,

2689
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:58,340
wow man,
I wish I could come up with something 

2690
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:00,171
that funny that was like,
she did it enough justice that you fell 

2691
01:56:00,171 --> 01:56:00,171
in love with him just through her 
quoting.

2692
01:56:00,171 --> 01:56:00,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

2693
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:05,511
She acted it out and she was hot.
It was really ridiculous because she's 

2694
01:56:05,511 --> 01:56:06,940
lying on her stomach in the parking lot 
and she's like,

2695
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:12,020
oh,
you mean life keeps fucking in the ass 

2696
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:12,020
dad.
Oh.

2697
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:13,150
And I was like,
wow.

2698
01:56:13,151 --> 01:56:14,860
And he's like a short fat guy that's 
doing this.

2699
01:56:14,861 --> 01:56:16,120
She's like,
he's wearing an overcoat.

2700
01:56:16,121 --> 01:56:18,370
It's hilarious.
I was like,

2701
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:19,990
wow,
I got to check that guy out.

2702
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:23,680
Like she's making me laugh by doing an 
impression of the guy,

2703
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:27,450
you know,
that's when you know your shit's good.

2704
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:31,980
Did the girl was pretty good.
She was super cool.

2705
01:56:31,981 --> 01:56:33,500
I probably couldn't do kinison isn't 
any,

2706
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:38,510
just especially that one.
Blinding can try and help me in the 

2707
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:39,510
parking lot.
She was just so,

2708
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:44,540
such a preposterous scene.
She's talking about getting fucked in 

2709
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:48,261
the ass.
Being a corpse is a for folks who don't 

2710
01:56:48,261 --> 01:56:50,781
know what the bid is.
Kennison had a joke about homosexual 

2711
01:56:50,781 --> 01:56:53,841
necrophilia tax that we're paying for a 
couple hours undisturbed with the 

2712
01:56:53,841 --> 01:56:55,860
freshest male corpses.
They had been arrested for it.

2713
01:56:55,861 --> 01:56:59,390
So he had this whole bit about the guy 
being on a slab like,

2714
01:56:59,391 --> 01:57:00,600
oh,
well I guess that's it.

2715
01:57:00,601 --> 01:57:02,790
Now I'm dead.
I'm going to go be with jesus.

2716
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:04,950
And then he starts rocking back and 
forth like,

2717
01:57:04,951 --> 01:57:05,790
hey,

2718
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:11,040
it feels like that in my ass.
You mean live keeps rocking the house 

2719
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,040
even after you're dead.

2720
01:57:13,310 --> 01:57:16,550
So fucking great bits.
This girl's doing this on her stomach in

2721
01:57:16,551 --> 01:57:18,080
the parking lot.
And I'm like,

2722
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:20,180
oh my god,
this is hilarious.

2723
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:21,980
She nailed it.

2724
01:57:22,850 --> 01:57:26,230
So I wonder where she is now.
Was probably married bunch of kids.

2725
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:34,180
Her pussy is dragging on the floor.
Just I can still do the.

2726
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:45,030
Oh god.
That was when I worked at that health 

2727
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,030
club.
That was a,

2728
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:46,330
a really important moment for me is 
that,

2729
01:57:46,331 --> 01:57:47,770
uh,
when I was like 18,

2730
01:57:47,771 --> 01:57:49,810
19 years old,
I worked at the boston athletic club.

2731
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:54,010
I got to see bobby or did you know he is
famous hockey player.

2732
01:57:54,490 --> 01:57:59,490
I'd never seen anybody that had had like
more than 10 knee surgeries.

2733
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,920
I'd never seen like a professional 
athlete whose knees had been destroyed 

2734
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:05,560
and I got to watch this guy like walk 
around.

2735
01:58:05,561 --> 01:58:10,561
He's a,
he's a legend in like boston legendary 

2736
01:58:10,561 --> 01:58:14,371
hockey player,
like one of the greatest hockey players 

2737
01:58:14,371 --> 01:58:14,371
of all time and the poor guy could 
barely walk.

2738
01:58:14,371 --> 01:58:15,460
And I remember thinking like,
fuck man,

2739
01:58:15,461 --> 01:58:17,170
that can.
you have to think about that when you're

2740
01:58:17,171 --> 01:58:22,171
18 years old,
you're spry and you're all fucking 

2741
01:58:22,171 --> 01:58:22,430
bouncing around like a little rabbit.
You don't think that like your,

2742
01:58:22,490 --> 01:58:25,630
your legs can get so fucked up that you 
could be like one of the greatest hockey

2743
01:58:25,631 --> 01:58:30,631
players of all time and still you've 
taken so much damage and so many 

2744
01:58:30,631 --> 01:58:34,351
surgeries that you know,
you're hobbling along and agony 

2745
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:34,351
everywhere you go.
Wow.

2746
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:35,650
Dark shit.
It's weird.

2747
01:58:35,651 --> 01:58:37,750
I just,
I was talking to this guy plays football

2748
01:58:37,751 --> 01:58:40,330
and I was like,
you'll probably like,

2749
01:58:40,331 --> 01:58:40,870
don't you?
I,

2750
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:41,970
I was like,
don't you guys

2751
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,300
die young?
And he was like,

2752
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:44,860
yeah,
yeah.

2753
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:45,810
Well,
and I was like,

2754
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:48,490
I regretted it after I said it,
but I just,

2755
01:58:48,491 --> 01:58:50,030
it was a really legit question.
Like,

2756
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:52,810
like you just,
you have a choice,

2757
01:58:52,811 --> 01:58:54,910
like there's enough research and with 
internet and stuff,

2758
01:58:54,911 --> 01:58:58,570
you know now like you are,
you are really fucking yourself up.

2759
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:00,410
It's so weird.
Yeah,

2760
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:02,220
that's a tough gig.
You know,

2761
01:59:02,221 --> 01:59:05,880
any,
any guy that chooses to use his body for

2762
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,490
any sport,
you know,

2763
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:12,560
anything.
We try to Make a living just off your 

2764
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:13,380
body or like a ballerina athletic 
environment or like fuck yourself.

2765
01:59:13,381 --> 01:59:15,570
how many,
how many guys get to be baryshnikov?

2766
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:17,710
How many dudes are like,
I am going to be the next punished.

2767
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:23,370
Meanwhile these bins are against 
thousands of them and no one gives a 

2768
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:23,370
fuck.
It's like,

2769
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:23,460
who's going to be the next lance 
armstrong?

2770
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:26,160
Guess what?
Nobody knows about that.

2771
01:59:26,161 --> 01:59:29,640
Go go into that fucking bike racing.
Trying to get famous were like,

2772
01:59:29,641 --> 01:59:31,110
hey asshole,
we don't need to ride bikes.

2773
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:31,560
Okay.

2774
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:34,930
I just got a cortisone shot in my hip.
I like running,

2775
01:59:34,931 --> 01:59:35,860
like I run,
run,

2776
01:59:35,861 --> 01:59:37,180
run,
and I just,

2777
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:38,920
all of a sudden my body was like,
no,

2778
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:39,880
stop,
stop.

2779
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:40,800
One second.
You know,

2780
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:42,240
that's just a pain thing.
That's the.

2781
01:59:42,241 --> 01:59:43,330
You,
you're still injured.

2782
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:44,500
Yeah,
I know.

2783
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:47,620
I know because I started running again 
for like three days.

2784
01:59:47,621 --> 01:59:50,010
I ran like,
like I used to and uh,

2785
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:52,750
and it came,
the pain came back,

2786
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:55,450
like I hadn't even gotten the shot and 
then I haven't run since then.

2787
01:59:55,451 --> 01:59:56,800
So it's been,
it hasn't hurt me.

2788
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:58,770
Were you having the paints in your ship?
Yeah.

2789
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:00,460
Ran under the lake.
it's a muscle in my hip.

2790
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:02,290
Oh,
it's a muscle in your short muscle.

2791
02:00:02,291 --> 02:00:07,291
Yeah.
I went and got x rays and a bit scary 

2792
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:10,201
shit.
I know people who have had hip 

2793
02:00:10,201 --> 02:00:10,201
replacements.
That's fucking dark.

2794
02:00:10,201 --> 02:00:11,200
No,
the x rays looked totally fine,

2795
02:00:11,201 --> 02:00:13,260
But he was like,
do you want to shadow cortisone?

2796
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,990
I was like,
okay.

2797
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:19,380
And uh,
I was so excited that my hips didn't 

2798
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:19,380
hurt.
It still doesn't.

2799
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:19,990
It still doesn't.
So I just,

2800
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:21,210
it doesn't hurt now.
But,

2801
02:00:21,211 --> 02:00:22,540
uh,
when I was running again,

2802
02:00:22,541 --> 02:00:22,870
it did.

2803
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:27,950
What if you have to get an iron hip?
That'd be crazy because I'm not getting 

2804
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:29,550
a hip replacement or a hip.
You know what they do?

2805
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:33,660
they saw off the end of your bone where 
your socket is.

2806
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:38,820
They literally saw it off and then they 
screw this fucking spike that goes deep,

2807
02:00:39,661 --> 02:00:40,260
deep,
deep,

2808
02:00:40,261 --> 02:00:43,320
like a foot into the bone with an 
artificial.

2809
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:45,410
I don't know if it's a foot.
It's about it.

2810
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:46,400
My.
I didn't measure it.

2811
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:51,440
Don't get crazy on the internet,
but they screw this fucking long pipe 

2812
02:00:51,630 --> 02:00:56,630
into the bone and then it's an 
artificial hip socket that's on the top 

2813
02:00:56,630 --> 02:00:56,910
and sometimes it doesn't line up so 
good.

2814
02:00:56,911 --> 02:01:01,911
Like one leg might be just slightly 
bigger than the other leg because of it 

2815
02:01:01,911 --> 02:01:05,360
and when you're walking you have this 
little fucking hits to your stroke that 

2816
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,061
you'll never get away with.
Like you'll never walk normal for the 

2817
02:01:08,061 --> 02:01:08,850
rest of your life unless you want them 
to open you up and resize it again.

2818
02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:14,770

artificial everything in the future.

2821
02:01:19,641 --> 02:01:24,641
They.
They made a titanium bone for a woman 

2822
02:01:24,641 --> 02:01:27,131
who had some sort of bone cancer and she
lost her jaw and they created her a 

2823
02:01:27,131 --> 02:01:30,851
titanium jaw and apparently it functions
just like the regular jaw that's better 

2824
02:01:30,851 --> 02:01:35,231
than her old inserted in place.
It's slightly heavier than the old job 

2825
02:01:35,231 --> 02:01:35,820
fuck is going on.
Oh,

2826
02:01:35,821 --> 02:01:40,821
that's actually a person's jaw that 
they've all added a safe environment.
