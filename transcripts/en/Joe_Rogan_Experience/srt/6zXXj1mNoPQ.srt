1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,421
Boom,
boom,

2
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:00,901
boom,
boom,

3
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:03,030
boom.
Four three,

4
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,103
two,

5
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,753
one

6
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,250
oh and the sweet,
sweet sound of amplified voices.

7
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:13,520
And my man shooter Jennings,
Gee man,

8
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,560
you look like you're supposed to wear
sunglasses.

9
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,210
Some dudes wear sunglasses,
you know,

10
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:18,830
like pitch,
get those sunglasses off,

11
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,380
but you,
you look like you're supposed to be

12
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:24,530
wearing sunglasses.
There is a point in time when I moved

13
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:25,364
here,
uh,

14
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,480
I remember well for a while they were a
prescription.

15
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:31,970
So I had an excuse for a long time that
I went back to contacts.

16
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:35,540
But there was a point in time when I,
I remember turning to my friend,

17
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,490
I was like 21,
and I was like,

18
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,270
I think I'm just going to keep them on
all the time and then it'll just be a

19
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:43,430
thing.
And that way I can just,

20
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,570
if I have to close my eyes and nobody
will notice or if I'm stoned,

21
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,460
nobody will notice.
When people get super famous like Jay z

22
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,880
famous,
they were um,

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,050
inside everywhere,
just so people don't catch a glimpse of

24
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:56,000
their eyes handed him a demo tape.

25
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,210
Can you start out like a scrub wearing
them then?

26
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,310
Then it's weird if you take them off,
you know.

27
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,400
Well it's a different thing in the black
community to um,

28
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,010
like a real cool black artist is just a
loud,

29
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,260
they're just allowed.
They can just do it.

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,280
Right,
right.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,970
I mean I'd be disappointed if like I saw
Bob Dylan out somewhere and he wasn't

32
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,460
wearing them like Christoper retires and
all the time.

33
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,110
Yeah,
good fade too.

34
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,520
It's like black,
Brown,

35
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,780
white Kinda.
Yeah,

36
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,640
he fits right.
The fuck and conor Mcgregor,

37
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:24,040
he can wear them indoors.
Oh yeah.

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,660
Some dudes can where I'm endorsed by
warm and doors,

39
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:31,130
I'd be a Douche bag plus the kind of
where I where like you know,

40
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,190
fucking sport ones.
I have a couple pairs of those that look

41
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:36,230
cool.
Cool ass aviator tiny.

42
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:38,990
These are in Porsche's.
My Dad used to wear a porsches in like

43
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:41,720
9.9 I ran across their purple ones and I
was like,

44
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,540
I bought like four pairs and I keep
breaking them in is my last one.

45
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,910
Those are very dope.
Those are porsche design.

46
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,830
They make some dope shit.
They do.

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,970
I just used to think that they only made
cars and then uh,

48
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,560
I felt they make phones.
Did you know anything like a phone?

49
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh yeah,
I saw it.

50
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,690
I've never don't they make,
didn't they make a blackberry for a

51
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,030
minute?
They think maybe made a blackberry and I

52
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:05,330
think they made another phone recently.
I would love to get one of those.

53
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,970
But it's a weird little design chop they
have.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,890
It is a walway phone.
I'm,

55
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm saying it wrong apparently people
correct me.

56
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,960
Huawei,
Paul.

57
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,290
While ways a Chinese company that
actually just got busted because their

58
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,040
newest advertisement,
it shows them taking selfies,

59
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,540
but there aren't really taking selfies.
They use only a super high end dslr

60
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:31,460
camera that to take the photo and
they're passing it off as if these

61
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,410
people were just holding it up,
taking selfies.

62
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,780
It's on a fucking tripod,
the whole deal.

63
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,180
You get a photo of that,
look at that look,

64
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,580
look,
look guys holding it up as if he's

65
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,190
taking a selfie.
But meanwhile there's a fucking

66
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,810
professional doom the tripod.
But he's making it look like he took

67
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:50,210
that picture.
Who busted then?

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,150
Ah,
I think the woman in the photo busted

69
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:58,010
them cause I think she took pictures or
had someone take pictures of the photo

70
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,380
shoot.
Yeah.

71
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,010
You gotta look on her

72
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,780
face like that too.
She's really,

73
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,430
come on.
Wow.

74
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,110
Way Burmese.
Meanwhile,

75
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,450
here's what's stupid about that.
They don't have to do that.

76
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,580
Those goddamn things take amazing
selfies.

77
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,380
That's a great phone.
Like the,

78
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,280
the newest,
latest smartphones.

79
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,580
They take incredible selfies.
I know,

80
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,920
but people never satisfied with the
truth.

81
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,010
This is why people,
gorgeous women.

82
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,600
We'll put those fucking crazy cartoons.
They'll selfie filters on.

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,460
Yeah,
they're beautiful.

84
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,560
And then they'll,
they'll turn themselves into a cartoon.

85
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,200
Like you don't get it.
Like you're supposed to have pores,

86
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,780
right.
We don't mind pores.

87
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,530
I don't mind the wrinkles in your skin
when you smile.

88
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,330
I don't mind.
You know,

89
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:40,820
the,
the,

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,780
the bubbles of saliva on your teeth.
Okay.

91
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,120
Would,
and people are getting this weird state

92
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,680
of mind where they think they're so,
you know,

93
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,930
they,
they said there's an epidemic of girls

94
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:54,220
like insta models that are actually
getting surgery to try to look like they

95
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,660
look in their selfies.

96
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,920
Oh my God.
You know,

97
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,860
speaking of instant models,
I just listened to David spades audio

98
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,420
audio book,
which I thought was great.

99
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,510
The uh,
I guess what polaroid guy in a snapchat

100
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,730
world or whatever and there's a lot of
chapters that deal with the incident.

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,180
I don't even realize,
I didn't even realize this is the thing

102
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,900
like adding dude,
I am so out of the loop with,

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,160
with,
do you go to instagram?

104
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,720
Do you,
do you like pay attention to it?

105
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,640
He just post pictures occasionally.
Man,

106
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,810
I,
I,

107
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,120
I'm not really good at paying attention
to any of it.

108
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,960
Twitter from day one I kind of was in
and I'll go in and out,

109
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:29,440
but it's hard for me to actually keep up
and care about it.

110
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:33,130
Like I hate posting pictures of myself
and my manager Adam is here.

111
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,120
He's always like,
dude,

112
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,600
if you're going to post something on
Instagram,

113
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,120
just make sure you're in it or
something.

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,940
Cause I'm always like taking pictures of
other people can listen to that dude.

115
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,050
That's ridiculous.
You can't,

116
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,530
you're not supposed to be in every
picture you take.

117
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,460
That's crazy.
I know,

118
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,300
but I'm,
I'm,

119
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm bad at it and I'm very bad at caring
about other people's pictures too.

120
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,610
And it's like,
like my wife will be like,

121
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,190
I just posted on instagram so I got to
go like it.

122
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,040
Oh,
that's annoying you to talk to her

123
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,800
about.
Her pictures are good.

124
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,060
So I'm,
I'm sure they're great,

125
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,900
but God damn do I have to double tap
each and every one of them just give you

126
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,700
the nod.
It looks good now we'll see.

127
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,500
See,
it's easy to throw that off and see.

128
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,440
My daughter is now,
he's 10 now as an instagram account and

129
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,240
if I'm not liking them,
I feel horrible.

130
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,330
I'm like,
I've got my wife's already like him.

131
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,680
I'm like,
yeah,

132
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,090
I think that's a lot of pressure for a
kid.

133
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,320
It will serve as are all pictures of
these lol dolls that she's obsessed with

134
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:26,500
anyway.
And slyly slime was a new one,

135
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,131
Huh?
Yeah,

136
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,870
it's crazy.
Fucks all that comment by the way.

137
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,630
It's fidget spinners out.
Yeah.

138
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,110
I just find out,
I mean my son got so obsessed with

139
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:38,020
fidget spinners and my daughter,
but really my son to the point where

140
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:41,770
like they were spending some time in New
York and I'd be gone up there and we

141
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:44,200
walked down the street and like every
fucking vendor,

142
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:47,260
every newsstand stand,
every like pretzel place had like fidget

143
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:50,530
spinners and like I'd have to buy it,
you know,

144
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,250
it'd be like,
he'd be like,

145
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,140
Ooh,
that one has a skull on it and be like,

146
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:55,870
okay,
and it's like 10 bucks and then to spend

147
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,210
just a right,
that guy in sense to manufacturer in

148
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,280
Taiwan,
he was like an 18 year old kid who came

149
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,580
up with that and he wanted to be an
entrepreneur and he made that.

150
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,710
Now he's like a billionaire.
How did he figure that out?

151
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,190
Like I want to talk to that dude.
Go,

152
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,500
hey man,
shit damn on the show.

153
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,101
Yeah.
Don't,

154
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,740
don't give out the secret,
but what the fuck is next?

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,750
I didn't see slime coming either.
My daughters have fucking gallons of

156
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,330
glue and and,
and,

157
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,090
and chargers.
Yeah.

158
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,850
Just yesterday,
my daughter and son were making slime

159
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,800
with it and I'm,
I was saying the same thing.

160
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,310
I'm like,
man,

161
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,310
I mean we had like ectoplasm slime and
nickelodeon slime when I was a kid and

162
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,980
like all but it was not like this.
All of a sudden it's like,

163
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
uh,
I can't believe it.

164
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:42,380
And you watch the commercials for glue.
They have glow in the dark glue and

165
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:45,140
they're like showing a kid making slime
with the elmer.

166
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,930
No.
Talk about an unexpected boost for

167
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,760
elmers chat.
They must have jumped.

168
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,750
He wants to jump on tide.
They came up timers between tide pods

169
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:58,751
and the slime tides like fucking real.
What people really eating detergent

170
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,850
real,
I guess that seems like it would be

171
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,870
unbelievably bad for your body to eat a
detergent.

172
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,610
We used to huff like Scotch guard when
we were kids or Potpourri.

173
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,020
I mean maybe it's a smell.
Markers.

174
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,210
Yeah.
I used to love the smell of like a good

175
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,440
sharpie,
like a fat one.

176
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,660
Do the thing in school for you where
they grab you and they,

177
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,390
they pull you up and then you almost
pass out and then they let you go.

178
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,600
And we used to do that in elementary
school where they,

179
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,450
yeah.
What was the,

180
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,120
how'd that work?
I think I would get behind these.

181
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,090
You pick it up and then she told you or
some shit.

182
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,100
Yeah,
until you can't basically breathe.

183
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,470
You're almost suffocating and then let
you go and then you're like,

184
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,490
hi.
Hi.

185
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,980
Hi.
Yeah,

186
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,550
I don't know.
The kids are always trying to,

187
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,320
well,
even monkeys,

188
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,041
man.
I mean,

189
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,370
animals try to change their state,
you know,

190
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,800
they,
they,

191
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,840
they,
they think it's just a natural thing.

192
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,730
The creatures tried to change your
state,

193
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,520
change your state of consciousness.
Even little kids.

194
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,360
But I wonder about that slime stuff
because I genuinely,

195
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,420
genuinely worry.
Like people I don't think had been

196
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:07,421
dealing with large volumes of glue and
detergent like that with the physicals

197
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,680
too.
That's another one.

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,640
Oh yeah.
Borax is,

199
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:11,120
yeah.
That's fucking toxic.

200
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,120
You think gets in your skin is an organ.
People don't realize that.

201
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,360
You don't think about that when you
spray it on all the different shit that

202
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,210
people put on their bodies.
Like I think about that when I use

203
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,260
sunscreen.

204
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,030
I'm like,
what is this stuff right here?

205
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,280
You're blocking your pores with some
Goo,

206
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,010
some good.
Well,

207
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,770
it's also your,
your skin's absorbing it.

208
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,890
Like,
um,

209
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,480
like when you go in that isolation tank,
that's one of the best ways to absorb

210
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:36,410
magnesium because of the epsom salts.
Like when you float around in the tank,

211
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,730
the epsom salts,
you know,

212
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,860
your,
your body absorbs magnesium from talking

213
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,380
about altered states.
Yeah,

214
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,290
yeah,
yeah.

215
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,780
Have you done that before?
I still haven't done dmt.

216
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,310
We had that conversation.
That's right.

217
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,730
We haven't had a conversation about how
the fuck have we only done one other

218
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,300
podcasts together.
That's ridiculous.

219
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,420
You know,
we live in the same town.

220
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,440
I know.
I know.

221
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,590
We went,
we had a great dinner.

222
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,520
It was dirty.
It was fun.

223
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:57,480
My mom.
Yeah.

224
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,860
That was really fun.
Yeah.

225
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,780
I got the Great Mrs Rogan out.
Yeah,

226
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,160
that's right.

227
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,220
It was fun.
We had a good time.

228
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,730
Do that.
Places the shit a place like you go back

229
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,900
in time.
That is my,

230
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,930
that is the spot where if they,
I feel like I've made it in this town.

231
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,810
If they know me by name there and I can
always get a spot at the bar.

232
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm close.
They know me by name,

233
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,440
but I don't always have a spot at the
bar.

234
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,190
Um,
you can,

235
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,840
I don't think anybody always gets a
spot.

236
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,700
The Pars Woods does.
Oh,

237
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,800
does he?
I bet he's got a giant Dick.

238
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,230
I here.
Sweet.

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,110
I bet it seems like it.
I finally met him there.

240
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,140
I had the balls to walk up to him one of
the recent times and I was like,

241
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,310
hey man,
you know,

242
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,170
you just got to walk up with the Hillary
Clinton joke.

243
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,490
I love video drowned.
He's a Republican now.

244
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,530
Yeah,
but he's,

245
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,363
he's,
he's,

246
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,690
he's funny.
I mean,

247
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,680
regardless of what side you're on,
he is just always on fire with that and

248
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,290
he,
he likes doing it just to aggravate

249
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:49,891
people.
Yeah.

250
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:52,830
Well he see,
it seems like he's done with the whole

251
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:54,070
acting thing,
right.

252
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,010
He,
I said he invested in apple in the 80s

253
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,050
and he's fine with being blacklisted.
Really?

254
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,280
Yeah.
That's what he said.

255
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,350
He bought it.
Made a tweet or something like that.

256
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,780
The investment in Apple.
Yeah.

257
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,780
Interesting.
Yeah.

258
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,880
That's how weird is that?
You can just say,

259
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,560
I think this company is going to kick
some ass.

260
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,910
We by piece.
Yeah.

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,420
I think you'd get a piece of a company
and then they become the apple.

262
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,900
Apple apparently has a more than a
trillion dollars now.

263
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,020
I know that and then insane.
That's kind of dangerous.

264
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,110
Anybody to have that kind of influence
though with these phones and shit.

265
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,910
It's like that's pretty,
pretty dangerous.

266
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,460
I kind of trust them with data though.
I feel like even with they're trying to

267
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:33,720
deal.
Yeah.

268
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,840
Well Google has a weird trying to deal
to,

269
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,910
will they also have secret servers in
North Korea and shit?

270
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,880
Yeah.
Well I mean they just have servers set

271
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,300
up and all these other countries.
All of that up danger cause I didn't

272
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,990
trust any of them.
What are they doing in north?

273
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,070
I don't know.
Dick Pics Rovers full of,

274
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,480
I think there's all kinds of networks
that had been going on for years that

275
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,260
are involved in shit.
I think I like I was,

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,790
I,
I tell my friends or my drummer

277
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,280
specifically I talked to,
but I was like,

278
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:04,060
man,
I think I like,

279
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,350
I'm not a rich guy,
but like I think that there's a point of

280
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,290
money that I would be,
I would like to know the threshold in

281
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,200
which you get past that and then like
the Saudis and then all the,

282
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,440
all these people start coming in wanting
a part of you and then you start selling

283
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:16,830
your soul.

284
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,870
Like whatever that is.
If it's 5 million bucks,

285
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,790
I just got to stay right there.
That would be,

286
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,180
I don't want to get richer than that.
Once you have influence,

287
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,100
I think it's,
it becomes a scary world.

288
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,430
So I like,
I think there's a lot of concern with

289
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,720
people wonder whether or not someone's
been like,

290
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,750
I've been accused of being approached
like that of my cia acid or that I,

291
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,670
here's a big one.
I think really the flat earth.

292
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,470
Oh,
the flat earth people,

293
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,251
they think that,
uh,

294
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:45,370
I've been approached to talk about the
earth being round to be around round

295
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,370
Earth shill.
Jamie started selling tee shirts.

296
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,350
Round Earth Shale.
James got round earth.

297
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,840
She'll tee shirts and he
sells@youngjamie.com man,

298
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,010
I mean around

299
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,420
or the shield shell is like saying like,
you know that the Reptilian people went

300
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:01,180
to you to be a human shill.
All someone told me that,

301
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:03,700
someone told me that they believe that
there's reptilians underneath the earth

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,300
and that they have a car.
They've carved tunnels through the

303
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,300
ground with laser beams and to have like
a network of tunnels they use,

304
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,120
they,
they travel amongst us,

305
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,280
waiting for their time to expose
themselves.

306
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,420
People believe like you see someone like
safe.

307
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,010
You live in an apartment building and he
tried by a dude's house,

308
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:21,970
got a fat house.
You Go,

309
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,230
wow,
that guy's got a fat house.

310
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:24,550
I wonder,
wonder who he knows.

311
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,540
I wonder if he's like he's in with the
mob or maybe he's deep with the

312
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,560
Democrats or maybe he's the bankers or
Cusco.

313
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,500
Who's he?
Who does he know?

314
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,630
Because you always think of like someone
like being like at a level where you're,

315
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,950
you're you like they sit you in a room
and they give you some communications

316
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:45,160
that you're not supposed to expose to
the rest of the world.

317
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,761
Right.
Well,

318
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,580
I mean there is again,
what I,

319
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,120
what I was saying about the threshold of
money.

320
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,130
There is a point and you know it's there
in which in,

321
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,720
I mean Google started with a couple of
dudes who were like,

322
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,940
we got this idea.
There was before that there was a thing

323
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:00,820
called web crawler.
That was kind of the first experience

324
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
of,
of me of a search engine that I'd ever

325
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,620
experienced.
Whether there was netscape navigator,

326
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:06,850
wasn't,
wasn't one of those,

327
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,330
netscape navigator was a,
was one of the first Brazil's browser.

328
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,860
Yeah,
there was a mosaic and netscape

329
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:14,260
navigator,
but there was a way to search that was

330
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:19,150
web crouther.
Lycos came later who came later,

331
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,320
but there was web crawler.
Danielle who and like us and then Google

332
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,410
never ask jeeves.
Yeah.

333
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:26,980
Cool.
Yeah.

334
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,670
Asked Jesus real thing has.com is still
there.

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,833
It's still there.

336
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,930
It's still there.
But,

337
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:32,980
uh,
but like,

338
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:35,500
you know,
you gotta look a couple of dudes in an

339
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,281
office,
Hey,

340
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,770
we got a web search and then all of a
sudden they're,

341
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,390
they've got con,
I mean,

342
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:45,450
Amazon has cia contracts that's known
because they use their servers to do

343
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:46,810
things.
You got,

344
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:48,760
you got to look,
Amazon has like super,

345
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,850
super secure servers,
but there's still been hacked.

346
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,420
They're as secure as anyone else's.
They just have,

347
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,130
once you make that,
I think it's the,

348
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:00,580
maybe it's 500 million,
there's gotta be a mark.

349
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,230
Yeah.
There's a number of ways in which people

350
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:03,880
start approaching you and saying,
hey man,

351
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:07,210
you've got too much influence.
Would you like to join our group and

352
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,310
we'll support you and you'll make a
billion.

353
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,500
Ooh.
And she's level.

354
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,330
Yeah.
I was in Italy.

355
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,340
I just got back and uh,
we,

356
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:17,260
uh,
took a boat from um,

357
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,350
uh,
from the Amalfi coast,

358
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,730
took a boat from a mall free to Capri,
which is an island house.

359
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,160
Gorgeous Matte.
But when you're there,

360
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,660
you see the crazy yachts.
Like Steve Jobs has a yacht.

361
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,120
Wow.
That he had built before he died and now

362
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:37,390
his family owns it.
Leo Dicaprio and Bella Hadid and his,

363
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,220
his yacht looks like an apple store.
It's the craziest thing.

364
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:42,551
I mean we,
we,

365
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,070
we drove right by it.
Yachts are weird too because they're

366
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,080
worth like a hundred million bucks,
but you could basically look,

367
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,450
drive up and smack it like no one has
done.

368
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,250
There's,
it's weird.

369
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,840
I mean that's how pirates work,
right?

370
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,650
You can just hop onto the,
throw a grappling hook up and they climb

371
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,630
on top of your yacht,
but we're driving by,

372
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,510
he's got smack it.
He's kind of,

373
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,500
there it is.
That's it.

374
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,180
Wow.
It's a floating apple store that I don't

375
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:10,730
want to have to deal with that and the
maintenance and everything.

376
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:13,700
I'm fine.
I would rather just just first class it

377
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,630
and a and go to,
you know,

378
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,320
go on a trip and maybe rent that yacht
for like,

379
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,190
if I had the money to do it,
even renting that I would be like a half

380
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,790
a million dollars a week.

381
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,550
Oh fuck that.
I'll just get a boat and go up to it and

382
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,160
write it on.
The difference between the experience in

383
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,440
a boat,
that big and an experience at a boat

384
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:33,620
that's like a fraction of that science
is not that different.

385
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,200
Like that's pretty fucking awesome.
But ultimately it's like a Ho like

386
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,890
that's there.
You get a good impression of what it's

387
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:40,724
like.
It's,

388
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,860
it doesn't,
it doesn't really do it justice in an

389
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:46,160
image because it's so,
it's so modern,

390
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,091
right?
Like,

391
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:47,691
uh,
when you,

392
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,970
when you get near it,
it's so strange looking.

393
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,133
Yeah.
I mean,

394
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,890
again,
it'd be awesome to party on that for

395
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:57,800
like a week.
It'll be the best of it would suck.

396
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,180
Look at that boat that just pulled right
up.

397
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,950
Hey Man.
Yo Steve,

398
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,300
my fucking eye pads,
bro.

399
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,050
Dude,
my fucking ipad just broke.

400
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,670
I mean,
I don't know man.

401
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,410
He,
did he ever ride it?

402
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,461
No,
he,

403
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:16,490
he shit the bed before he wrote it.
You know what's really fascinating,

404
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,260
I read something about he died of
pancreatic cancer and one of the things

405
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:25,820
he did was he drink fruit juice every
day and we used to think the fruit juice

406
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:26,810
is really good for you,
right?

407
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,340
You're drinking fruit now they say,
no,

408
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,183
no,
no fruit.

409
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,450
It was really good for you.
But drinking fruit juices is kind of an

410
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,460
unnatural state.
There's no fiber in that.

411
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:38,600
So you're just drinking straight sugar
and now they say that drinking like a

412
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:43,580
glass of fresh squeezed orange juice has
the same sugar as drinking a can of

413
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,320
soda.
So you really,

414
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:48,990
your body doesn't differentiate much
between chemicals and soda though

415
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,900
chemicals are not good,
right?

416
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,420
Some chemicals,
but some of them,

417
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,220
they're innocuous.
Like you could drink,

418
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,090
like I was reading something about like
diet coke,

419
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,460
like someone was saying like Diet Coke
give you brain cancer.

420
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,550
And that's her saying that it prevents
cancer.

421
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,310
What they're there.
There was an article I read recently

422
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:11,120
that was saying that they thought that
Diet Cola is actually helped it.

423
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,780
They flipped their a script on that too.
They have a little fast talk at the end

424
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:15,614
of it.
It's

425
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,730
dot spots.

426
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,190
Those fucking,
first of all,

427
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:26,420
that fast talk shit should be illegal.
I don't know why that's not illegal.

428
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,660
Remember they used to do that at the end
of those goddamn commercials,

429
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,550
they hire somebody who talks like a
carnival barker.

430
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,560
Whole commercial like that.
That'd be awesome man.

431
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,950
Yeah.
Make it all ineffective here.

432
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,430
What does that,
um,

433
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,810
could die.
Coke help curb colon cancer's return.

434
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,940
What?
Diet coke?

435
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,630
Who fucking see new study shows that
Colin can,

436
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,890
here's the problem,
man.

437
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,770
Fucking studies dude.
Studies are a problem because you,

438
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,820
you can get like there was a study
posted recently.

439
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,300
It was a,
a questionnaire that showed that people

440
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:04,010
who eat higher carb diets live longer,
but it's,

441
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:08,190
it's basically a questionnaire that over
20 something years of like what you eat

442
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,100
and then the people who died,
like there was all sorts of problems

443
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:13,710
with it.
Like they didn't exercise as much.

444
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,860
They were fatter than the people who ate
more carbs.

445
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,080
And also you're asking people to
remember what they ate,

446
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,510
which is like very,
very ineffective.

447
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,820
And then the same cup,
the same place,

448
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,120
put out a study,
um,

449
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,300
really recently that showed the exact
opposite effect.

450
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,710
And so it's like,
well,

451
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,670
what the fuck if I'm just a regular guy
who barely has time to read the paper

452
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,850
and I read a study every now and then,
it's basically like what you catch,

453
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,230
you can catch some second ausas found
that about half of the benefit appear to

454
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:46,140
be due to people switching from regular
to diet sodas.

455
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,890
Oh,
so the colon cancer was really just,

456
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:52,530
you stopped drinking coke.
Coke was giving you colon cancer.

457
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,620
So now diet coke,
coke prevents colon cancer.

458
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,620
It's really,
no coke gives you fucking colon cancer.

459
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,750
Right?
It's so hard to know.

460
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,760
It's so hard to know,
man.

461
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,180
I try to keep up.
I cannot,

462
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,760
I try now.
That's the problem with the Internet and

463
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,830
everything.
Back in the day when we just didn't know

464
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:10,380
shit at,
seems like things move smoother,

465
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,921
you know?
Yeah.

466
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,140
But you remember like,
people thought all kinds of goofy shit.

467
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:14,940
Like thought most of your diet should be
bread.

468
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,110
I would that food pyramid and took his
rib out is on deck now.

469
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,180
But that was her.
That was a rumor back in the day.

470
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,290
The city,
no,

471
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,180
I met him.
He might do,

472
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:25,440
might actually do that.
Yeah.

473
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,191
Um,
yeah,

474
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:28,290
that was one.
How about here's the granddaddy of all

475
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,530
rumors,
Richard Gere and that dribble terrible.

476
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,380
Everybody knew that.
How is that possible?

477
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,690
I want to drum up your ass.
Ho It's possible.

478
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,230
My Buddy Steve did his residency in
Miami.

479
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,790
He's a ophthalmologist and he told me
that they pulled all kinds of things

480
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,130
that a dude's buts and you know,
those uh,

481
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,050
kind of fic lightening,
uh,

482
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,330
those thick a light bulbs that look like
a,

483
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,890
like a tree,
like a Christmas tree,

484
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,820
right?

485
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

486
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,390
Some dude shoved one of those up,
his asshole and it broke watch,

487
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:57,791
uh,
the,

488
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,410
who is America yesterday?
I haven't watched a single episode of,

489
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,330
I love it.
I love that show by the way.

490
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:04,290
I'll do that.
You know,

491
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,330
there was a lot of,
there was a lot of talk about it and not

492
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,130
think it was great what he did.
I mean,

493
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,260
all he did was he set up people to,
to show the ugly people if,

494
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,090
if they had it.
But I did not see that episode.

495
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,410
Please.
A genius man,

496
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,420
man.
I went real quick story.

497
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,610
I was like,
there's a band called Hell Down Glory

498
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:23,580
that I've loved for years and the lead
singer and lead were virgil.

499
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,810
They live in Reno.
And so he took me to Reno on the,

500
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,570
I'd been Rena before,
but he took me on the hell bound glory

501
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,970
tour of Reno,
uh,

502
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:35,550
which was him going to different bars
and shit.

503
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,830
And he took me to this guy's house and
it was,

504
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,140
it was a friend of his lived down the
street and they was like,

505
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:43,680
their garage was open and a bunch of
people hanging out playing vinyls in

506
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,150
this dude and drinking,
you know.

507
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,860
And at some point this guy was like,
hey,

508
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:47,860
I got show you something.

509
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,940
And he reached into his ceiling light.
He had like one of these but not what

510
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:52,830
the,
the uh,

511
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,830
uh,
clouds on it.

512
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:57,370
It was just a regular like light and you
pull out and he had up in there,

513
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:02,430
he had an x ray that he pulled out and
it was an x ray of a woman's vagina with

514
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:07,510
a flying v Guitar neck that the head
stock in,

515
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,670
in it.
It was an x ray of that.

516
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,650
So it got stuck.
I mean,

517
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:14,370
I don't know how,
I mean with the fucking tuning pegs and

518
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,340
everything,
but it was,

519
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,390
it was a,
so,

520
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,180
you know,
you know,

521
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,670
oh,
can you believe coming out?

522
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,481
Yeah.
I mean,

523
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,890
how can we,
going in

524
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,420
woman's vagina is remarkably flexible
thing.

525
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,140
They make babies,
babies come out of their bodies.

526
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,790
Yeah.
But I mean that's a whole hormonal

527
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,710
thing.
Their body sets up for nine months to

528
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,521
let happen.
I mean,

529
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,860
just sticking,
maybe she really loves music.

530
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,870
Oh Man.
Maybe she really,

531
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:43,570
really,
really loves hair metal and went there.

532
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,810
Maybe it's just a giant fan of slayer
wants that once that guitar in her body.

533
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,930
Woo.
But my friend Steve said he,

534
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,270
they pulled all kinds of things out of
people's bodies and uh,

535
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,590
he said he saw he was in Miami and he
said that it was during the cocaine days

536
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,320
when I met steering the cocaine days.
Like they ended,

537
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,060
oh yeah,
that's over bro.

538
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,950
That's like,
so 1980.

539
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,000
Uh,
but he was there during the eighties,

540
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,130
seventies and the 80s.
That's when I met him.

541
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,580
Okay.
I was in high school when I met him.

542
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,030
Um,
so I think I was 15 or 16.

543
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:22,330
Where'd you go to high school?
Newton south high in Newton,

544
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,070
Massachusetts.
A suburb of Boston.

545
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,710
How'd you meet him?
A taekwondo.

546
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,940
And he was,
uh,

547
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,980
he was,
uh,

548
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,200
doing his residency for ophthalmology
and uh,

549
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,000
I was a young high school kid who was
competing and so it's all,

550
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,050
I was over there every day.

551
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,340
So if you came there,
he saw me.

552
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,650
And um,
he,

553
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,551
uh,
he,

554
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:47,551
so he was doing his residency in Boston.
He was a,

555
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,760
he was finishing it up in Boston,
but he had done some of his work before

556
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,170
that in Miami.
So this was,

557
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,740
I graduated in 85 so he was probably
Miami,

558
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:57,910
like 80,
81,

559
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,350
somewhere around.
Then he just got back.

560
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,330
He showed me all kinds of pictures,
dude.

561
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,190
Wow.
This is back before the Internet.

562
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:06,010
I got to see brains,
people's brains hanging out.

563
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,780
You showed me some photos of bullet
holes with a polaroid or something.

564
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,070
Take question.
I Dunno.

565
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,200
I don't remember.
Dubious.

566
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,670
Dubious there.
Well,

567
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,970
people were dead.
You know,

568
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,180
the brains,
they were dead.

569
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,210
I didn't get to see like the,
the light bulb up the asshole.

570
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,470
He didn't have to pay.
Hey man,

571
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,130
stay still while you're screaming.
Yeah,

572
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,973
yeah,
yeah.

573
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,030
But uh,
distract him.

574
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,550
But he legitimately did have some photos
of some atrocious things,

575
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,910
but he said it was just to go from being
a medical school school student to doing

576
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:44,281
your residency in Miami and just seeing
just crazy amounts of violence.

577
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,740
He said it was just insane.
Like if you seen cocaine cowboys,

578
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,660
I have not.
Oh my God.

579
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:51,800
Billy Corbin,
who's been on the,

580
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,630
maybe made two of the most amazing
documentaries ever.

581
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,810
That's about the blow air on cocaine.
I mean,

582
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:01,460
uh,
the movie blow and all that.

583
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,470
George [inaudible],
George hung or whatever.

584
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,951
Well,
no,

585
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,860
it was,
how about Grizelda Griselda Blanco.

586
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,800
Who is this a bad ass bitch from
Columbia?

587
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,840
Was she from Columbia?
Bogota?

588
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,260
Yes.
That was the Miami Shit when I think I

589
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:17,410
saw part of that documentary,
but I always wanted to watch it.

590
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,560
Oh,
it's so good.

591
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,191
It's so,
he's getting,

592
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,530
just got two of them,
so if you,

593
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:22,740
you do it,
you got to fucking get together.

594
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,310
Docent,
cocaine cowboys to why?

595
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:28,160
Fuck around with a crazy,
hard to remember a cql name,

596
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,650
but a cocaine cowboys one and two.
Oh my God.

597
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,970
It's that.
There was one year where everyone who

598
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:42,350
graduated from the police academy either
was murdered or went to jail.

599
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,090
Every single graduate.
Wow.

600
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,180
Was either killed because they had a
part,

601
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:51,920
a part of the cocaine business or a,
they went to jail for being corrupt.

602
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,330
Wow.
All of them.

603
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Wow.
There's more pay.

604
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,120
I don't know if this is true,
please google this.

605
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,610
There.
There were at least at the time,

606
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:06,440
more banks per capita in Miami than
anywhere else in the country because it

607
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:09,770
was all use to launder cocaine money.
Wow.

608
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,790
Yeah.
No Bullshit,

609
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,660
man.
Again,

610
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,940
man,
you get that level of money as he

611
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:17,330
started getting banks and stuff.
I'm just saying those two documentaries,

612
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,890
I can't say enough good things about
them.

613
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,360
They're so good.
It sounds exhausting.

614
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:23,060
Not the documentaries,
but the actual business of doing it.

615
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,580
Well.
That's why you need coke and new coke

616
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,410
while you were in that sense,
get high on your own supply,

617
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:29,090
man.
That's the only way to keep up with the

618
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:30,720
young kids.
I mean,

619
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,060
if you guys,
Rick Ross,

620
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,740
which one?
The real one or the fake one?

621
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,980
The rapper freeway.
Ricky.

622
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,520
No,
no,

623
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:37,870
no,
no.

624
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,120
Yeah,
the real Rick Ross.

625
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,711
I know.
I know.

626
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:40,544
There's the freeway,
ricky.

627
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,810
Yeah,
that's the one you want to ask.

628
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:44,750
You don't want to ask the wrapper.
The wrapper was a prison guard.

629
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,700
Do you know that?
Yes.

630
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,930
Yes.
Well,

631
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,740
you know freeway,
ricky who's been on the show a couple

632
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,230
times,
sued to get his name back and just to

633
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:58,340
keep his dude from using his name
because he was actually Rick Ross.

634
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,230
That's his actual fucker.
Ne Story.

635
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,850
I didn't know he was on your show,
Dude.

636
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,640
He's been on twice.
Rick Ross freeway.

637
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:09,641
Ricky was the guy who was selling all
the cocaine that paid for the contras

638
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,010
when the contracts are fighting the
Sandinistas in Nicaragua and that whole

639
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,530
aura north shit course freeway.
Ricky was the one who was selling all

640
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:20,660
the coat to these people.
He didn't know how he's getting these

641
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:21,231
coke.
He didn't know.

642
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,970
He was actually getting it deep,
deep,

643
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,970
deep state telling you,
I'm telling you to find the threshold.

644
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,610
And he learned,
he learned how to read and it's a great

645
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,970
style.
Ricky learned how to read in jail and

646
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:39,971
then learn how to become a lawyer in
jail and then realize they tried him for

647
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,541
a,
they did.

648
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:45,060
They hit him with three strikes,
but they hit him with two charges at the

649
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,400
same time,
which is not how three strikes work.

650
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,430
So you went to jail for life and then
got released for time for time served

651
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,010
because they tried him incorrectly.
Oh right.

652
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:58,200
It's okay.
Just one of be strikes was in exactly

653
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,390
one of his strike.
There were there were at the same time,

654
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,730
you can't do that.
It has to be like you go to jail,

655
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:04,140
you come out,
you go to jail again,

656
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,480
you come out and go to jail again and
go,

657
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:07,290
all right,
you're a criminal and then they keep you

658
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,670
in jail.
That was a high idea,

659
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,420
which is fucked up man.
Hey,

660
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,450
what's it like sitting across the table
from him?

661
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,430
He's a very nice guy.
Very smart guy.

662
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,110
He was a tennis player,
man.

663
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,600
Played tennis in Compton.
Yeah.

664
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,310
Couldn't fucking read men,
couldn't read,

665
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:24,330
played tennis and Compton and was just
seeing all these people around him that

666
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:25,800
were making crazy amounts of money.

667
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,140
Wow.
And is a real calm,

668
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,660
nice guy.
And that's one of the reasons why he did

669
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:34,570
so well said.
He wasn't this crazy buckwild do drive

670
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,720
and rolls royces,
throwing money out the window.

671
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,390
He wasn't that guy.
He was like the cool,

672
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,330
calm,
collected John Wick sort of character

673
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,230
that kept his shit together,
you know,

674
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,890
and everybody respected him because of
that.

675
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,890
He just was like,
you mean the same reason why he learns

676
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:53,160
how to be a lawyer while he's in prison?
He's a systematic,

677
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,470
you know,
intelligent dude who just had a shit

678
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:56,720
education,
you know,

679
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,950
just grew up in a very bad,
scary,

680
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:03,090
dangerous environment and you know,
didn't even learn to read until the guts

681
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:05,580
in jail in Lincoln,
the history of the Iran contra

682
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:09,540
conspiracies on lake got cocaine.
He was the guy that figured out how to

683
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,100
sell this shit and wow.

684
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,140
It was selling coke and didn't even know
who he was selling it for.

685
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,230
Didn't know that the people he was
selling it for like the,

686
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,490
the,
the contacts that he had were directly

687
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,490
supplied by the Oliver North,
the Bush and yeah.

688
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,150
Wow.
Interesting man.

689
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,510
Wow.
I used to have oliver north for

690
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:29,970
president t shirt.
I wore it just to piss people off.

691
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,090
I didn't even know what it meant.
I was like 17 or something.

692
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,560
Shit.
Oh man,

693
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:35,750
that's not,
ah,

694
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,240
yeah man.
It's a,

695
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,600
the whole thing is crazy that this rick
Ross guy,

696
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,470
the rapper was actually a prison guard.
There's a photo of him was fucking

697
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,600
prison guard uniform on.
Wow.

698
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,260
I mean I like him a lot.
I ran across the web.

699
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:51,330
Are,
do I liked that big songs a lie on

700
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,490
what's the big st the better now the big
single,

701
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,150
I don't know.

702
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,150
I do one big one that I've sang before.
What's the record with a Dell is a lie

703
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:01,320
on it.
That was a record that I loved.

704
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,410
What's his big hit?
Me and Manton hanging out a lot and we

705
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,460
listened to Rick Ross all the time.
That's like really?

706
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,310
Yeah,
because gets to get together.

707
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:10,780
Do Code.
I mean,

708
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,100
I mean the nights,
right?

709
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,601
Uh,
no.

710
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,030
A bit like a that,
yeah,

711
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,350
like I liked the rick Ross guy that was
going to come in,

712
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,750
but he wouldn't do it on camera.
It was weird.

713
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,130
Like you wouldn't do it after he wanted
to do it.

714
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,830
They'll do it at a certain time of
night.

715
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,120
But so here's the thing,
man.

716
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:30,180
Some of that shit is publicists cause
I'll tell you the same thing happened

717
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:33,390
with Liz phair who I'm a giant fan of
hundred percent.

718
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,040
I've been a fan of Liz phair for Andrew
and exile in Guyville was fucking

719
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,650
fantastic.
Fucking loverage record and evil empire

720
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,280
at the same time at the record store

721
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,210
in Nashville,
Tennessee.

722
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:45,790
That Reggie's machine and Exxon guy.
Totally.

723
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,060
My wife also miss who we went near with
WHO's listing.

724
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,920
She loved Liz phair too at the time she,
she came and we got high together.

725
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:54,970
She's like,
you can get high here.

726
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:55,421
I'm like,
yeah,

727
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:58,050
I don't have a boss.
Alex Jones got high as fuck on high.

728
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,850
That was fucking awesome.
He's trying to come back on and I just

729
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,500
don't know if I could do it.
Oh come on,

730
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,260
let him come on.
They're fucking socks up them down.

731
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:08,320
They are shutting them down.
But the problem is he still on trial

732
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,110
this,
this whole trial that's going on with

733
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:14,440
the Sandy Hook and all that shit has to
be resolved for us.

734
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,800
But it doesn't mean like Bill Maher
respect to Bill Maher.

735
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,530
I respect him for saying he gets to
speak to,

736
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,640
he was on his show and people were
clapping and cheering that he was pulled

737
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,770
off of these networks and pulled off of
everything.

738
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,550
He's like,
look,

739
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,400
this guy has said crazy lies about me is
what Bill Maher said.

740
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,590
He said to the guy said crazy lies about
me.

741
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,570
He goes,
but he still gets to talk like this is

742
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:37,660
what America is about.
Free speech means all speech.

743
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,880
But see like,
here's what I don't understand.

744
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:43,150
Like Alex had me on many times and he
supported my record.

745
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,740
Black ribbon sort of Cayman.
Yeah.

746
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,450
You've been on the Alex Jones show many
times.

747
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:48,130
I've been,
I've been on it three times.

748
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:49,720
Where you ever sober?
Yeah.

749
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:51,010
Every time.
Yeah.

750
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,350
Every time.
Doesn't show sober.

751
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,161
I've never,
I,

752
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:54,640
it was never a situation.
Well,

753
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:56,020
the first time I was,
uh,

754
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,710
we have the black ribbons record that I
did as Steven King and stuff like,

755
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:02,860
so when that record came out,
nobody would support the record.

756
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,010
So Alex and things on your record.
Yeah,

757
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,650
older record from what I do,
he plays,

758
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,740
he plays a Dj or a radio talk show hosts
that comes in and out of the record.

759
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,580
Um,
Stephen King.

760
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,320
Yeah,
as Stephen King.

761
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:21,940
So like when I did that record,
Alex Jones is the only person that would

762
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:23,380
support the record.
He put it,

763
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,260
he,
he debuted the whole record on his show

764
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,660
and then I went,
it was on for two hours by phone and

765
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:32,320
then I went in and was on his show in
person,

766
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,750
uh,
about just the music business.

767
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:37,300
That's all we were talking about and
like kind of how things were.

768
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,630
And then later I was on for bitcoin
discussion kind of,

769
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,970
um,
by skype or something.

770
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,730
But I will say this in his defense in
all of this,

771
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,950
I just think that like,
dude,

772
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,180
that guy has been saying things,
conspiracy theories about all kinds of

773
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,100
things.
What do you want?

774
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,360
Call him that or not?
They'd like forever.

775
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,690
And like now the,
the situation is like so volatile that

776
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:03,850
like they're going to,
you know,

777
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:04,750
the sandy hook thing.

778
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,310
All right.
So like they definitely caught fucking

779
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,810
Anderson Cooper having the green screen
and it's probably because they had

780
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,740
another person.
They're talking to the mom and then they

781
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,200
know what happened.
There's a video of Anderson Cooper

782
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,830
interviewing one of the moms from Sandy
Hook and he walked,

783
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,550
he leans a little too far forward and
his nose disappears and it's probably

784
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:29,551
because they had a standing report or
talking to the mom and what Anderson

785
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,200
Cooper was then like,
uh,

786
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,030
put in via,
you know,

787
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,260
whatever crane and like you kind of need
to see that is there,

788
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:40,340
I mean,
I know this is where we're propelling,

789
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,540
but my point is,
is like,

790
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,310
and I'm not,
I mean sandy hook,

791
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,280
I remember where I was when I heard
about sandy hook and it was horrific.

792
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:48,590
And I don't believe for a second that
there's like,

793
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,360
it's all fake or anything like that.

794
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,800
But like Alex's thing has always been
that I remember watching him go to

795
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:58,820
Bohemian Grove and when we did the
fucking record on,

796
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,100
this is back when nobody was paying
attention to them.

797
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,010
It just certain small group.
But I remember we did the black ribbons

798
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,500
record and we took a clip of the
laughing.

799
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,680
He went,
he snuck into Bohemian Grove and film

800
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:13,340
the ceremony and there like a scene
where they were not a scene.

801
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,030
I get the scene in his film,
but there's a part of that where they're

802
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,310
doing the ceremony and they have this
light.

803
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,220
It's like Disneyland when you go well
look to our God.

804
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,700
Yeah,
yeah.

805
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,400
But it's like,
it's done in a way where it's like

806
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:29,240
Disneyland when you watch like the
ferries fly around the castle.

807
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:34,241
Like there was a whole thing where there
was like a laugh that happens at the end

808
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:36,020
of the MOLEC thing or whatever.

809
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,330
Or the big Al and the,
and the funeral pyres drove.

810
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:40,730
So druids,
right.

811
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:43,940
So like I used a part of that,
but I remember watching that documentary

812
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:44,690
and he,
you know,

813
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,260
his deal has always been so over the top
where like you go,

814
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,820
he's like,
where are the,

815
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,250
he like,
go to the local people aren't near

816
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,150
Bohemian Grove.
He's like,

817
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:55,400
we're looking for where the Satan,
it's go to go do the thing,

818
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,500
you know?
And it's obviously at this point,

819
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,770
it's not like people who are knowingly
satanist.

820
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,520
It's like really old fat rich guys that
go there and there's probably hookers

821
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:08,240
and all kinds of shit because that's
what happens at big rich things,

822
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,410
especially in the nineties I mean,
so he get away with it.

823
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:12,770
You're right.
And so like now with all this,

824
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:16,640
and they're crucifying him,
especially pointing especially the Megan

825
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,480
Kelly thing,
and I just feel bad for it.

826
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,840
I mean,
especially the Manga because that was

827
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:23,240
clearly a hidden piece with Alex because
like they,

828
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,270
she buddied up to him and then then
focus that piece on the sandy hook

829
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:29,870
thing.
You know,

830
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:32,900
they had their talk in her defense,
how could she not?

831
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,770
Of course she's got us if you're going
to come,

832
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,490
if I was going to come,
but if I came here with the,

833
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,450
with the intention of like just talking
to you and then all of a sudden you were

834
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:45,284
like,
hey,

835
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,330
on this day on this thing,
when you did this thing,

836
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:50,030
like you focused on this one thing,
now it'd be like,

837
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,370
Oh man,
like this is a hit piece.

838
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:52,761
Like,
yeah,

839
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,910
but you're a musician and he's,
this is what he does.

840
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,840
I know my friend,
he's been my friend since 1999.

841
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,410
I get more shit from being friends with
Alex Jones and anything in my life

842
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,460
because actually,
you know what I'm just saying like,

843
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:09,910
I'm sure I'll get hit for this,
but the point is,

844
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:12,910
is that point check checker twitter,
I'm ready for it.

845
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,150
I don't,
you know what,

846
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,340
I don't have time to check it maybe next
year,

847
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,570
but like,
um,

848
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,640
but the reality is I just think that,
and I'm not even here from like the side

849
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:25,520
of the political point of view is this
is this,

850
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:29,960
watch this video was the video.
It says d quality Anderson Cooper's

851
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,700
disappearing,
knows Greenstein clip debunked.

852
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,860
See that?
Hold on.

853
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,780
Do you see what it says was debunked?
Which means happens.

854
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,623
Uh,

855
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,531
hold on,
let,

856
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:41,430
I'm sorry,
wasn't bad.

857
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,950
Quality video right here.
It'll play about three seconds.

858
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:45,090
Then there's a,
it,

859
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,950
there's a weird part on his nose that
happens.

860
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,300
But to say it's a green screen,
I would just,

861
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,930
I would tell the same,
the same people that are looking for

862
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:54,540
conspiracies and everything.
They use this to say that the space

863
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,070
station didn't exist.
Right,

864
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,140
but hold on.
Stick right around right there.

865
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,090
Hold on some and you can't even really
see it.

866
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,400
It's something really happened to those
super quick.

867
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,460
It looks like it was.
It was just like a digital glitch.

868
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,590
That's it.
No,

869
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,140
that's not it.
And this is what they said.

870
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:13,760
I couldn't find it anywhere else.
The other piece he leans forward is no,

871
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,240
look,
here's what I think.

872
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,790
I think that they had a stand in because
he couldn't be there,

873
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,710
but hold on.
You might be wrong,

874
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,390
right?
I could be.

875
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,470
This is,
we're talking about several years ago

876
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,150
you might have been fucked up memory
this.

877
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,630
Let's try to find the video that said he
was there all week shooting from the

878
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:29,460
exact same location.
Maybe it was,

879
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,560
maybe I'm wrong.
Got You.

880
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,510
They got to you.
Shooter Jennings.

881
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,850
I would say the same thing.
You know,

882
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,760
you make more than a hundred thousand
dollars a year.

883
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,640
Dude knocks on your door and starts
talking to you about conspiracy.

884
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,400
Well,
if you make it $34,000 a year,

885
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,320
you look at people to make 100,000 like
damn,

886
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,840
you had to pick all my fucking bills and
he gets to that hundred thousand dollar

887
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:53,550
level.
Well you got to sell out son.

888
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,420
But that's how people look at it.
But there is a threshold.

889
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,640
There is a threshold.
I remember when I was broke,

890
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,910
I had an a suburban.
I wasn't broke but it was,

891
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,520
I was doing it right but I had a
suburban and some guy and I got into a

892
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:08,100
fucking road rage situation on the
highway and he goes,

893
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,590
you fucking rich asshole.
I go rich [inaudible]

894
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,890
driving a fucking suburban man.
Like what is rich to you?

895
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:22,830
Rich is driving a suburban fine ma'am.
I have that like I already had the rich

896
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:26,710
thing because people thought that I was
rich because my dad,

897
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,510
which I never really,
I never was.

898
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:31,090
I mean he was supportive of me,
but once I got here it was,

899
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,980
I was Kinda on my own and I liked that.
But then then once I talk about bitcoin

900
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,060
with you,
like fucking five years ago or whenever

901
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:38,660
it was,
I was here three years ago and

902
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,431
everyone's like,
oh,

903
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:42,820
you gotta be rich now.
Cause that was like I can not rich coin.

904
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,350
Yeah.
But I mean look,

905
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,640
what's the point up til like seven grand
now.

906
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,580
Yeah.
It went up to 19 zero seconds.

907
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,670
Keep going down.
It hadn't dropped very much below six

908
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:53,890
grand.
But I mean when I was here with you it

909
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,600
was like less than a grant.

910
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,350
But um,
you know what I'm trying to say about

911
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:03,700
this is not like I'm not validating his,
this Anderson Cooper thing,

912
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,290
but that dude has always been fishing
for things like that and it's always

913
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:12,400
been his gig and it's been as Gig from
columbine.

914
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,970
It's been as Gig from all of this.
And I understand that the passion and

915
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:19,540
the emotion involved with the children
that died in sandy hook.

916
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:22,090
And I have no,
I'm not defending him on that deal.

917
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,420
But at the same time,
that's always been this guy's Gig.

918
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,360
I feel like dad is where he legitimately
fucked up.

919
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,630
I don't think if you take,
you take away,

920
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,050
I got to defend him.
I just can't say to fucking fuck up.

921
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:35,980
Yeah,
but this

922
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,880
is a silly fuckup he's saying that for
sure it was a fake,

923
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,210
but did he say for sure it's a Aa did
people sent me the clip?

924
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,270
They sent me the clip of him saying that
it was 100% fake.

925
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,610
He thought it was fake.
So he said it,

926
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,970
but he thought it was fake.
Yeah,

927
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,900
he thought it was a,
he thought it was a false flag.

928
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,280
So he said it.
I mean,

929
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,970
but that's part of them.
That's a part of the conspiratorial

930
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:59,380
thinking.
That's a real problem.

931
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,210
It's like saying,
you know,

932
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,480
he said some shit about me.
He said said some shit about me and it's

933
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:07,870
100% not true.
He said that the post your interview

934
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:09,940
with them,
I don't remember.

935
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,040
I think it was post,
it was post.

936
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,520
He said that the government threatened
my family to stop talking about

937
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,260
conspiracy theories.
No,

938
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,060
no.
Nobody threatened my family.

939
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,850
No one zero never happened.
Did Not happen.

940
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,250
It is fake.
It is a lie.

941
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,110
Someone told it to him,
I guess,

942
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,610
or he says someone told to him.

943
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,250
Okay,

944
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,560
it didn't happen.
There's so,

945
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,870
that's me.
I understand,

946
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,880
but he's,
you understand like how frustrating that

947
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:37,350
is.
This is a minor thing.

948
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:40,440
Someone him lying,
not lying.

949
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,420
Okay,
somebody,

950
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,690
he said,
someone told him,

951
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,490
I believe he's telling the truth,

952
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,890
but it's not true.
He could have fucking called me.

953
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:49,840
He's got my number man.
Call me.

954
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,320
So he didn't even bother calling me
[inaudible] about to go live from

955
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:54,154
Austin,
Texas.

956
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,860
I need to know did someone threaten your
family?

957
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,500
Stop talking about the moon landing and
big foot sturgeon.

958
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,360
Same Magic to fucking imagine that going
to threaten you to,

959
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,080
you got to stop talking about big foot
man.

960
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,210
I'm like,
well no,

961
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:07,781
I,
I found,

962
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,150
I did a show.
This is a well documented,

963
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,860
I've talked about it a hundred times in
the podcast.

964
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,570
I did a show called Joe Rogan questions,
everything and during that show,

965
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,200
over a period of six months,
I fucking question a lot of shit

966
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,930
legitimately,
but I did it with researchers.

967
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,080
We had the staff,
we had producers,

968
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,320
we went and we actually went to like
these places where these people are

969
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:37,870
claiming to see you fo's who went to
these places where people are claiming

970
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:40,630
to be able to uh,
what does that shit they do?

971
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,080
Remote viewing.
Remote view.

972
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,720
Yeah.
We talked to those guys.

973
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,960
Great movie.
We talked to all these people and I

974
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:50,650
found a real,
a clear thread through all of it that I

975
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:54,370
documented in my 2014 comedy central
special where I said,

976
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,820
here's what you don't find.
When you go looking for bigfoot black

977
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:01,870
people,
what you do find is unfuckable white

978
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:05,740
dudes,
you will more likely define big foot.

979
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:09,370
Then you are black people out looking
for big wholesale alien abductions

980
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:11,590
probably can.
It's dudes you can't get laid and they

981
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:13,920
go looking for hidden mysteries.
It need that.

982
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,000
This is a real big part of it.
I know.

983
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,930
My point is from doing that,
show it,

984
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:24,010
it's soured me off conspiracy theories.
Conspiracy theories were fun for me and

985
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,770
me and my,
especially Eddie Bravo mean Eddie Bravo

986
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:30,220
would get high and we'd watched
documentaries on flying rods and all

987
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,700
this ufo documentaries and all the
other,

988
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,130
the the,
the fucking

989
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,070
Zachariah sitch and she love it.
I love that.

990
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,630
I love that stuff.
But here's the thing,

991
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,060
I used to watch a,
a chariots of the gods all the time to

992
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:44,120
get it all falls apart under scrutiny.
It all of it,

993
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,360
all,
all of it.

994
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,500
It's fun,
but it falls apart if you're being a

995
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,900
serious person.
And if you really being honest about

996
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,880
what you actually know,
this is the problem.

997
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,350
It's like the saint and the parallels,
like that comparison comparing to Alex

998
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,670
Jones,
saying that my family was threatened.

999
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:00,710
It's the same thing.
My family was never threatened.

1000
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,090
No one ever threatened me.
So,

1001
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:04,460
but he's saying this on the radio.
Why is he saying it?

1002
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,360
Because someone told him and he may be,
he believes it and he also thinks it's

1003
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:11,210
fun to say.
It's the thing to say if you're really

1004
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:13,580
into conspiracies,
but this is the problem with these

1005
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:14,690
fucking conspiracies.

1006
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,380
They say things they don't know are true
and they say,

1007
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm like,
they're true now.

1008
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,890
This is fine.
If you just hold on,

1009
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,620
it's fine if it's not an issue.
If you're talking about the Illuminati,

1010
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,630
if you talking about your kid getting
shot,

1011
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,870
if your kid's dead and someone says,
hey man,

1012
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,160
this fucking Tom Smith on the radio
saying you're full of Shit.

1013
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:38,090
You're a crisis actor and your kid's not
dead me and you're crying every night.

1014
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:41,030
You wake up in the middle of night
crying because some fucking guy,

1015
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,360
but you are a little bit,
I'm just visiting this right to be Alex

1016
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,180
Jones.
I and I defend that as well

1017
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,020
for being David.
I'll coat one time I would have David

1018
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,120
Allen Coe do.
I played a show with David [inaudible].

1019
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,690
This is not any,
let's get sandy hook out of this because

1020
00:42:56,691 --> 00:43:00,980
I'm not trying to talk about this.
Let's make some defending the right of

1021
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:02,150
people to be who they are.

1022
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,430
And I love David Alinka is music and all
that,

1023
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,460
but I played a show with David Onco one
time and my dad always would tell me

1024
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:11,450
these things about him.
You know,

1025
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:12,200
he,
he really,

1026
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,410
he liked David and everything,
but there was always kind of a little

1027
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:18,830
distance of like,
there was a showman ship part of him and

1028
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:21,290
they're like a good example of this,
again,

1029
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,790
distancing from sandy hook.
But a good part of it was that when,

1030
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,610
when David Allan Coe,
we did a show with him one time my mom

1031
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:31,220
was over on the side of the stage of me.
I was opening for him.

1032
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:34,190
This is many years ago before I even had
a first record out or anything.

1033
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,390
Um,
and David Onco did a sh,

1034
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,530
you know,
we did our song,

1035
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:44,590
our set and then he played and he was
onstage and he performed a song my mom

1036
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,040
wrote called storms never last.

1037
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,320
So my mom's over on the side of the
stage and we were talking.

1038
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,350
He and my mom are watching it and he's
singing it with his wife and stuff.

1039
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,250
The next night I'm opening up for him
and he goes on stage and he goes,

1040
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,330
last night,
Jesse culture was right in the front row

1041
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,980
when I sang this song with my wife and
she was crying and like I'm sitting

1042
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:09,710
there going,
I was here and she was not crying.

1043
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:11,970
She was standing as you called it.
She was not on the front row.

1044
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,591
Right,
right.

1045
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:14,330
My mom just killed her,
wrote this song,

1046
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:18,410
storms never last teasing and,
and that's his character.

1047
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:22,190
That's who he is.
All I'm saying here with like,

1048
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:27,170
I'm as forgiving about him lying to the
audience because that is what he's doing

1049
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,520
at the moment.
It's his.

1050
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,590
I could sit there and go,
you know what,

1051
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,310
you're,
I'm going to take you in the back.

1052
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,440
We're going to talk,
I'm going to tell this audience tomorrow

1053
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,101
night.
He's a liar.

1054
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:36,510
He's a piece of shit.
Fuck him.

1055
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,910
I'm not going to do that because it's
David Allen Coe.

1056
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:40,350
He's done.
You just sit it on the show,

1057
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:44,270
which is,
I'm not much larger audience heading the

1058
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,090
millions and millions of pieces of shit.
I'm just saying I do character,

1059
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,450
but why would I do that to him?
Because it's like,

1060
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:53,220
you know,
I just feel like,

1061
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,240
look man,
the Times that I met Alex,

1062
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:57,180
the Times I've been around him,
yeah man,

1063
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:01,410
his Gig is this and he got called out
for a specific thing.

1064
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,770
Yes,
it involves the lives of children and

1065
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:05,430
everything that I understand that I'm
not,

1066
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:10,410
I'm not at all sympathizing for those
family or for him versus those families.

1067
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,400
But I'm just saying,
I just think that like at the moment

1068
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:18,810
everything is so hot with this and it's,
and it's kind of exhausting and it's the

1069
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,280
Internet is the reason for it.

1070
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,520
And in my opinion,
because I think that like all of the

1071
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,800
years that have come along,
the mass amount of people that have

1072
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:28,890
migrated to social media,
the way that the integrated

1073
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:31,620
conversations happened,
the way that that stuff ends up on the

1074
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:35,940
news now,
like aol chat rooms in fucking 1998 that

1075
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,910
shit did not end up on CNN.
People were not listening to those,

1076
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,590
that the best thing to get,
the closest you could get to fucking tv

1077
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:46,890
was to catch a Predator when you were on
that at that time.

1078
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:49,110
You know?
And I feel like at this point in time,

1079
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,000
people need,
again,

1080
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,950
not those families there lawsuit.
That's fine.

1081
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,790
That's their thing.
But,

1082
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,060
but I just feel like people need to
lighten up a little bit.

1083
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,690
In the sense of,
uh,

1084
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,340
I just think that the social media thing
is very hazardous and I think that

1085
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,560
people's faith in all of it,
it doesn't have to do with,

1086
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:13,620
with fake news and it doesn't have to do
with Russian bots and all this shit.

1087
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,290
I just think that like Alex Jones is a
casualty because he's always been,

1088
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,690
what do you mean by it doesn't have to
do with fake news and Russian by,

1089
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:25,560
I mean that like teachers always excuses
for all the reasons why people

1090
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:26,550
understand you.
That's real,

1091
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:29,910
right?
I believe that of course fake news is

1092
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,853
real,
but

1093
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,670
there's like,
there's,

1094
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,780
there's an NPR document.
No,

1095
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:36,261
no,
no.

1096
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:40,740
I'm a radio lab podcast about Russian
troll farms.

1097
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,630
It's fucking fascinating.
It's really interesting.

1098
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,520
I mean,
these people show up at work and their,

1099
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:50,521
their basic job is to put propaganda out
on instagram and social media and

1100
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:53,940
twitter and comments.
And I agree on that stuff.

1101
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,690
I agree.
But,

1102
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,250
but let's,
let's get out of it.

1103
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,720
Let me,
let me tell you an example.

1104
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,010
Uh,
what I,

1105
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,550
what I have seen of this,
I run a bulletin board system called

1106
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:05,850
bits sunrise,
which is like old technology that used

1107
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:07,720
to be modems used to dial into
Baltimore.

1108
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,540
It systems.
You can tell net into it.

1109
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,400
Tell net is a port port 23 is the telnet
port.

1110
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:19,850
Well dvrs also share port 23.
So dvrs like to have yards like your,

1111
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,300
your TV connected to storing your not
all,

1112
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,200
not all.
Yeah.

1113
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,740
Will you,
if you record a show on a weekly basis,

1114
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,400
it is.
There is an open port.

1115
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:32,920
It's not always 23 on the units,
but it's shared with,

1116
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:36,730
with the telnet port.
So during the election,

1117
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,880
during the months up to the election and
the months after the election,

1118
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:42,850
I would say four months,
five months leading up five months after

1119
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,840
on my bolt.
This kind of technical when it,

1120
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,700
when I'm trying to explain this to,
but uh,

1121
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,350
uh,
when you,

1122
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,380
when you tell net into a computer you
use for mine,

1123
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:58,900
you would tell them that end and it
would give you a log in you,

1124
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,460
it has a picture this drawn and you,
you put your name and your address or

1125
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:05,020
your password and you log in.

1126
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,680
Well,
during the five months leading up to the

1127
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:11,080
election and the five months afterwards,
I was getting every day,

1128
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:15,580
probably all day long,
10 or 20 connections that were coming in

1129
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:16,840
and they were just,
uh,

1130
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,000
uh,
wouldn't say a Bot.

1131
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,570
They were like,
they were scripts that were trying to

1132
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:27,080
log into dvrs and trying to log in to,
um,

1133
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,060
like Ip cameras that you can control and
everything like that.

1134
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,310
So I was watching for,
for that about a year period.

1135
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,000
So let me pause you here.
So you're saying that these bots,

1136
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:40,870
we're trying to control dvrs and cameras
that people have on their television.

1137
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:43,870
They were just testing and 90% of them
were coming for China.

1138
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,170
10% of them are coming from maybe Russia
and other places,

1139
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,060
but 90% China,
Korea,

1140
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,980
because you can look at the Ip
addresses.

1141
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:54,130
So what are they testing for the test?
All their flaws and they're trying to do

1142
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,340
is they would try,
they would be looking for a Lennox

1143
00:48:57,341 --> 00:48:59,380
login,
which would be like um,

1144
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,150
you know,
login again,

1145
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,170
like if you were to tell net or ssh into
a device like that,

1146
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,940
the first thing that would get was a
login and usually it's root is the

1147
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:10,774
controller.

1148
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:16,050
And so they were just trying to find,
they were just just blindly mass blindly

1149
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:20,950
going to Ip addresses in trying to hack
into them route and then they try

1150
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:23,020
password.
Then they try like this.

1151
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:24,400
They tried that,
they tried the black,

1152
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,200
you know,
so the Russian Bot thing,

1153
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,810
I understand that,
but I don't think it was a coordinated

1154
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:31,240
effort.
I think that like all during that whole

1155
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:33,850
time I was watching my computer,
like I have,

1156
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,490
it's kind of,
I'm getting real nerdy here,

1157
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:41,140
but it's like I have these games that
like in that people play and like once

1158
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:42,730
you get past the 13th,
14th,

1159
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:45,370
15th node,
which essentially means like once

1160
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,530
there's 15 people playing at the same
time,

1161
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,790
then the game stop working.
So I would be having to deal with these

1162
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:54,550
Chinese and Russia thing,
Russian and all these,

1163
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,370
all of them just mass trying to just
break in.

1164
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,130
And it was because of the dvrs and
because the Ip cameras,

1165
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:05,080
like they were really literally trying
to hack your system to just do whatever.

1166
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:08,620
I don't know what the purpose was,
but like I watched it and it was,

1167
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,800
it was China mostly.
I mean Russia was a small amount and I

1168
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:16,210
think that all those countries all the
time or have people that are constantly

1169
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:20,230
trying to uh,
hack and interact with these,

1170
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,180
uh,
with our shit.

1171
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,410
I mean,
it's just a thing,

1172
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,640
you know,
there's that as well.

1173
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,960
There's that as well.
Yeah.

1174
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:28,130
But I think all of there's that as well.

1175
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,070
But there's also people that are
absolutely trying to influence

1176
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,290
elections.
They're absolutely trying to influence

1177
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:37,550
our system and that they're trying to
manipulate political parties and they're

1178
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:40,400
trying to start descent.
And this is one of the things that's

1179
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:44,420
really fascinating about this,
a radiolab podcast where they talk about

1180
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:47,840
how these Russian troll farms literally
set up protests.

1181
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,390
They hired people to pretend to be
Donald Trump,

1182
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,170
and they hired people to pretend to be
hillary and put her in a cage and have

1183
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:55,520
people chanting,
lock her up.

1184
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:00,790
Like this is all manufactured descent
and manufactured outrage that there

1185
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,870
they're strategically promoting.
I mean,

1186
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,680
that's fascinating to me.
But here you've got to think,

1187
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,460
pause for a second.
You got to think Russia is we,

1188
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,690
you're talking about a giant place.
Okay.

1189
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,840
So to pretend that what's happening with
these people hacking into dvrs and web

1190
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,520
cameras is all that's happening.

1191
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,850
So,
but you're saying what you're exposed to

1192
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:27,851
that you witnessed as small example of
what happens when people are exploiting

1193
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:31,040
vulnerabilities in systems.
But that doesn't mean that's the only

1194
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,180
thing that's going on.
No,

1195
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,860
I'm not saying that at all.
I know you're not,

1196
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,230
but I want to clarify.
There's a lot of things that are going

1197
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:37,790
on.
There's a lot of things that are going

1198
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:41,830
on because people are dealing with these
new technologies and these cases terms

1199
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,620
and which way?
Well,

1200
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:45,810
with the Russian hacking elections thing
like,

1201
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:48,110
and I don't like to get political
because I don't really fuck,

1202
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,470
you don't have to get political.
Look at it objectively looking at it

1203
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,850
like a system.
Like look at it like this,

1204
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:54,650
look at it like you have a body.
Okay.

1205
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:59,900
And your body has an immune system and
your body's immune system is constantly

1206
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:02,180
under threat of all sorts of different
things.

1207
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,890
You,
you fucking touch a door knob,

1208
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:06,200
you wipe your nose.
There's a lot of shit going on.

1209
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,530
Right?
This is very similar if you just looked

1210
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:13,160
at it objectively to what happens
whenever you have a server on the

1211
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:14,220
Internet,
when you,

1212
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,610
we need,
you hear about the Republican Party

1213
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:20,480
getting hacked into or you know,
different people's emails getting

1214
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:23,050
exploited by,
you know,

1215
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,160
someone from outside.
That's a hacker.

1216
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,070
What is that?
Well that's they're trying to find a way

1217
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,630
through the system.
It's just natural thing.

1218
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:30,800
If you put up a wall,
people go,

1219
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,090
hmm,
how do I get past that wall?

1220
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,700
You know,
if you make $34,000 a year and a guy

1221
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:36,560
makes $1 million,
what does that guy know?

1222
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,100
There's,
this is a natural thing that happens.

1223
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,130
How is this any different?
Like I guess what I'm trying to ask

1224
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,350
about this,
it's like when I was watching that

1225
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:48,620
happen with my system,
it's like how is this any different than

1226
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:52,400
what is going on for the last hundred
years?

1227
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,660
Cause he comes.
Okay.

1228
00:52:53,661 --> 00:52:55,910
Because it's new because no one has been
able to get it.

1229
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,263
I don't know.
It's new.

1230
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,020
No one has been able to get into your
folders before.

1231
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,130
No one's been able to get,
no,

1232
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,030
no.
One kid sitting in Czechoslovakia who

1233
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:08,660
has a computer has been able to figure
out how to turn your Webcam on and watch

1234
00:53:08,661 --> 00:53:10,430
it beat off.
This is a new thing,

1235
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,920
but we didn't have a Webcam to beat off.
It doesn't matter for,

1236
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,240
but you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1237
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,980
This is a new thing.
This is a new thing.

1238
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,260
So because this is a new thing,
I feel like for some reason,

1239
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,780
but it is human nature thing.
It is human nature.

1240
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,390
But I don't understand what your point
is.

1241
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,860
Well,
I guess what I'm asking here is,

1242
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,753
is,

1243
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,530
is in,
in the way of the,

1244
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,810
I just feel like the Russian Bot thing
is,

1245
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,280
was all of that,
I feel like the Russian bots is,

1246
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:37,080
is a,
is a term for people who don't

1247
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,780
understand computers in a way,
and they've,

1248
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,500
they've just kind of thrown that out
there as a political device sometimes.

1249
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,440
I think that Russia,
China,

1250
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,280
Korea,
like every other fucking country that is

1251
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:55,281
enabled in a way in which they're so far
ahead technologically was involved in

1252
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,660
all kinds of fucking fuckery.
And there's still involved in it.

1253
00:53:58,661 --> 00:54:01,530
It will still do that.
During the election it was fucking a

1254
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:02,670
hundred times.
Sure.

1255
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,410
But,
uh,

1256
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,310
you know,
I'm just,

1257
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,900
I just,
it's hard for me,

1258
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,270
you know,
back circling around to the Alex Jones

1259
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:12,180
thing,
all of this new technology,

1260
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:17,181
all of the people who are awake woke
facebook on facebook.

1261
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,340
They know you're an angel,
you're woke on facebook.

1262
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,570
So wake,
you know,

1263
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:24,570
it's like a,
I felt bad for fucking childish Gambino

1264
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:27,060
that he had a song that had stay woke
and it,

1265
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:30,990
because immediately that song that that
was what an amazing song and it was a,

1266
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:34,140
it was that that term became dumb
immediately.

1267
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,510
But I,
but I just feel like,

1268
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,390
um,
all of this that's happening,

1269
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:42,150
all of this talk,
all of the him getting banned,

1270
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:47,151
all of this stuff,
it's all this kind of like effect of the

1271
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:52,950
world instead of being out in the world.
Everyone has,

1272
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,710
has,
has gone to this point where it's,

1273
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:56,670
you know,
these groups,

1274
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:59,670
these really rich groups,
Google and facebook and twitter and all

1275
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:03,630
this and everyone has,
has gone to this central point and other

1276
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:06,990
lynching people,
whether or not you agree with Alex

1277
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:07,950
Jones,
whether or not you like him,

1278
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:11,040
whether or not I think he's being
launched in the situation right there.

1279
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,830
So I get,
I get that there's all these people that

1280
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:16,530
are doing all these different nefarious
things.

1281
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:20,000
This has been going on forever and now
they're using new systems to do that.

1282
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,360
They using the internet and all these
open pipes and these connections that

1283
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,500
they can make trick is that the public
is there.

1284
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,600
They've gotten them to go to this a one
arena.

1285
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,290
That is my problem with it.
Is it like as much of a nerd and a

1286
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,460
technology person?
I am.

1287
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:35,910
I like,
I hate that people have instead of

1288
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,820
really,
I mean I'm sure they have their own

1289
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:43,320
lives but like the fact that we have
become so centralized to these small

1290
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:48,321
groups of Internet companies like social
media and things and then now look,

1291
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,730
it's on both sides man.
I mean Alex Jones is getting lynched.

1292
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,990
Harvey Weinstein,
whatever.

1293
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:57,240
I know he's,
he's a very different things,

1294
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,890
but every,
everyone is a very,

1295
00:55:58,891 --> 00:55:59,461
very,
very,

1296
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:02,010
very,
very different than not defending him.

1297
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:04,050
But I understand how you made this
behavior,

1298
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:07,540
but the connection is the fast
connection as people were just attack

1299
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,660
the findings.
The minute it look,

1300
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,590
those people could have suits against
Harvey Weinstein,

1301
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,060
Stein Steen,
and we can know about it.

1302
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:17,420
Of course we knew about it because the
Wall Street Journal or what,

1303
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,470
whoever,
or New York Times who were in that thing

1304
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,630
was a new yorker.
Yeah.

1305
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:23,600
The new,
yeah.

1306
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,270
But

1307
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,900
I guess my point is,
is,

1308
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,120
you know,
I mean,

1309
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,490
I,
I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion,

1310
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:35,491
but I just feel like that the
centralization of society into social

1311
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:41,491
media is resulting in a lot of things
that are very ugly.

1312
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,160
And I think that the Russian Bot thing,
the Chinese hackers thing,

1313
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,770
the Alex Jones issue,
the me too movement,

1314
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:51,830
all that stuff,
which I,

1315
00:56:51,831 --> 00:56:53,590
I'm,
I'm behind all the people that,

1316
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,730
that were hurt.
I'm not,

1317
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:58,030
I'm behind the sandy hooks people on
behind the people who had the bad

1318
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,360
experiences in Hollywood.
All that.

1319
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,120
What are you proposing?
What are you saying?

1320
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:04,120
I'm just saying that I think that,
that it's unhealthy.

1321
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,990
I think that social media thing has
become too centralized.

1322
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,740
There needs to be decentralized,
uh,

1323
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,090
sort of centralized because there's all
your kids in groups.

1324
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,000
They are instagram.
I mean,

1325
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:17,980
it's 100% centralized.
I mean,

1326
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:20,320
it's owned by a group,
several groups.

1327
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,840
It's several,
uh,

1328
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,510
you know,
everyone's kind of going to Mcdonald's

1329
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:30,310
to have these conversations as opposed
to it being something that is a little

1330
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:31,660
more healthy.
I just find,

1331
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:35,740
I just think that that people,
I think Alex Jones should have always

1332
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:39,070
been able to be crazy in his world.
And he was always nice to me.

1333
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,450
And you,
you said he's your friend.

1334
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,490
Like,
you know what the problem with Alex's,

1335
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,260
he needs someone sitting right next to
them.

1336
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,690
Someone like me,
someone who when he talks and he said

1337
00:57:47,691 --> 00:57:48,790
something crazy,
go wait a minute.

1338
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,630
Wait,
how do you know that?

1339
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,700
And he goes,
well we have the documents will show me

1340
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:54,010
the documents.
Well the documents don't say that.

1341
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,330
Well you know,
the problem is,

1342
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,220
or they are definitely trying to
influence.

1343
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:57,941
And he'd go,
yeah,

1344
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,190
they probably are.
But if you leave them alone,

1345
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,050
if you leave them alone and just let
them rant.

1346
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,670
By the way,
he's doing six hours,

1347
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:08,140
eight hours of radio a fucking day.
And he's definitely likes to drink.

1348
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,550
So he's doing six hours of radio a day.
At least three of them are drunk and

1349
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:17,020
he's fucking fill in time and screaming
and no one can say anything to him.

1350
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,810
And he's the fucking man over there.
That's also part of the problem.

1351
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,810
He's got a bunch of these other people
that are around them all the time and

1352
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:26,110
there conspiracy theories as well.
But there are 28 and you know,

1353
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,570
and then you know,
they're hanging out with Alex Jones and

1354
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,390
it goes on rants and no one interrupts
them.

1355
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:34,570
It's abroad argument with all of it
because I agree.

1356
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:36,910
But he was always,
he was always transmitting.

1357
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:37,840
He was always like,
Hey,

1358
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:41,380
show me where the Satanists are going to
worship it took to sacrifice children.

1359
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,130
That's fine.

1360
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,300
But I get it.
I think what happened is now the idea is

1361
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:48,280
that he's influencing people
politically.

1362
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:50,740
Like the whole,
you know the whole uh,

1363
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,550
Podesta pizza gate,
that all that stuff was scared the shit

1364
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:58,210
out of people when that guy showed up at
that pizza place and fire off around and

1365
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,010
you know,
and then they want up arrest them and

1366
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:02,210
they really thought there was a dungeon
in the basement where again,

1367
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,960
kids centralizing in social media is the
cause for a lot of these reactions.

1368
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:11,961
Is that centralizing and social media or
is that people exciting people to go and

1369
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:14,710
take action against something that may
or may not even be real?

1370
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,920
If you are you allowed to yell out fire
in a crowded theater,

1371
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,900
right.
This is what ultimately the problem,

1372
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,250
right?
It's not whether or not he believes in

1373
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:26,030
Bohemian Grove,
which is real and be proved it on video

1374
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:28,760
back when they had vhs tapes and I
watched it.

1375
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,850
I mean I've known Alex since 99 or 98 I
think maybe I've known for a long ass

1376
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:39,971
time and that this is a very big
difference between then and what's

1377
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:44,390
happening now is as far as the reach and
influence and I think people are sort of

1378
00:59:44,391 --> 00:59:48,140
panicking about reach and influence and
what it means and how to mitigate it,

1379
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,260
how to change people,
how to stop people from going into pizza

1380
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:54,140
places and shooting them up because they
think that something that they heard

1381
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:56,930
online is true.
There's a lot of stuff that people hear

1382
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:59,540
online that isn't just not true.
You know,

1383
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:03,230
the lizards underground or the fucking
earth land flat and there's a lot of

1384
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:05,030
stuff that's just nonsense.
So it's,

1385
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,550
it's hard to separate.
Here's what I think.

1386
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,030
I think we are going through an
adolescent stage as a,

1387
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,080
as a being,
as an evolving being.

1388
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:20,380
And I think our bodies and our minds and
our consciousness are becoming

1389
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,280
synchronized with technology.
And along the way,

1390
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:28,310
like right now we are in this chaotic
screaming,

1391
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:29,960
sweating,
crying,

1392
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,740
pissing shitting,
state of chaos.

1393
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,790
And we are looking to figure out how to
stop the bleeding.

1394
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:40,280
We're looking to shove thumbs into
dykes,

1395
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:45,610
dykes meaning like dams and we're
looking to try to figure out a way to

1396
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:49,250
stop the bleeding.
We're trying to put patches and bandaids

1397
01:00:49,251 --> 01:00:51,740
on things.
We're trying to manage the chaos.

1398
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:54,890
We're trying to figure out what,
and this is a stage that we're going

1399
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:56,690
through because this,
hold on a second.

1400
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,960
This is a new thing.
This is a new thing for human beings.

1401
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,970
The ability to communicate widespread
over millions and millions of people

1402
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:09,890
instantaneously is a new thing.
So people have say that never had say

1403
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:11,480
before,
they have influenced it,

1404
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:12,440
never had an influence before.

1405
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,200
They have their ability to contribute
and they might not have thought these

1406
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:19,820
things through and these things catch
fire and they run through dry forest

1407
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:23,180
like a goddamn tornado of,
of,

1408
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:25,980
of,
of flames that you see on CNN when the

1409
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,040
Mendocino fire up in northern
California,

1410
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,890
this is,
this is what happens with ideas because

1411
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:34,250
there's no way to contain them and they
don't know what's right or what's wrong.

1412
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:38,360
I think that what we're going through
from the period of 1994 the period of

1413
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:43,130
2018 is like a crazy fire in the middle
of a hurricane.

1414
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:47,450
It's like everything is nuts and no one
knows how to stop it and no one knows

1415
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:50,870
what to do and what do we do?
We get together and shelters and we

1416
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:53,870
fucking give people water and we tried
to stop the fire and take away

1417
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:55,910
everyone's lighters and that's what
we're doing right now.

1418
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,660
We're trying to take away lighters.
We trying to stop people who start fires

1419
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:04,580
and this is what's happening with Alex
and it's not that Alex is a bad guy,

1420
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,120
is that he has,
he's by himself eras.

1421
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:13,810
It's irresponsible to say that you know,
for sure a fact that these parents from

1422
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:16,520
sandy hook or crisis actors and their
kids never died.

1423
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,530
It's irresponsible.
And he didn't think it was irresponsible

1424
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,100
when he was doing

1425
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,610
it because he's probably caught up in
what he does and he's caught up in the

1426
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:26,730
wave of ad libbing just like you and I
are ad living.

1427
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:29,100
We didn't even talk about what the fuck
we're going to talk about.

1428
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,640
Right.
Turned on and where we had a couple of

1429
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:33,720
drinks.
You're,

1430
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:35,670
what you're saying there is very red.
I don't mean to cut you off.

1431
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,623
It's okay,
but,

1432
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:40,800
but what you're saying there is very
smart because to me,

1433
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,750
uh,
you know,

1434
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:43,590
it is,
it's,

1435
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,310
you're right.
He,

1436
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:50,130
he has always been doing this and it
just point in time his reach has grown,

1437
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,410
right.
And he's now there's a wind behind him.

1438
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,830
He used to be it.
Oh,

1439
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,610
in Seattle.
It was raining every day and he had a

1440
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:59,550
little patch of dry newspaper,
like that shit on fire and everybody go,

1441
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,660
ah,
Alex is crazy.

1442
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:01,441
Yeah,
no,

1443
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:02,250
I agree.

1444
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,180
I think,
I think,

1445
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,660
I think what I'm trying to articulate,
and I'm not doing as well as I wanted

1446
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:09,180
to,
but I think what my problem is,

1447
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:12,990
is the synchronization of consciousness
is what I'm not into.

1448
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,570
I think that I think,
you know,

1449
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,490
just like you have a Rut of people who
believe that,

1450
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,020
uh,
you know,

1451
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:26,880
they now believe that the sandy hook
thing is fake and they're calling the

1452
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:30,900
families because of this conversation.
This is where that lawsuit is really

1453
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:35,250
coming from because the other people,
but then you also have another side of

1454
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:35,981
it.
And it could be,

1455
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:39,540
as you know,
back in the day when they said that Paul

1456
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,360
Mccartney was dead,
but they got harassed,

1457
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:47,390
but it was on such a small level because
there was no way to just email Paul

1458
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,580
Mccartney and,
or email and say,

1459
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:53,760
you're not the real public mccartney.
You're fucking dead.

1460
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,940
Not just that.
There was no way to exchange these ideas

1461
01:03:56,950 --> 01:04:01,260
amongst people real time on facebook all
day long,

1462
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,090
which is the centralization that creates
these rivers and in these ruts that

1463
01:04:06,091 --> 01:04:09,420
people who don't know what to do and
they fall into one rut or another and

1464
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:11,250
they kind of become this,
this,

1465
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,090
this kind of streamline thing.
So I think the way you just described it

1466
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:16,710
as is very,
um,

1467
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,670
articulate essentially thing.
Matt is a new thing when we are in a

1468
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:22,500
really exciting time.
But why,

1469
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:24,660
why I say that?
Because they used to say that about the

1470
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,910
printing press.
They used to worry about that with the

1471
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:28,650
written word.
They used to worry about that with

1472
01:04:28,651 --> 01:04:30,960
everything.
The distribution of information is not,

1473
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,110
it's not whether or not it's healthy,
it's just a part of what the,

1474
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:39,150
this being does with this being does is
constantly search for innovation and

1475
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:39,900
novelty.

1476
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,120
That's what,
that's what the human being does.

1477
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,690
But like I guess,
I guess yes,

1478
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:47,160
but it was looking at your phone over
there,

1479
01:04:47,161 --> 01:04:48,300
man,
you got to fucking iphone.

1480
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,730
Don't you think you could go to the
people making an iphones and go,

1481
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:52,020
hey bro,
we're good.

1482
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:52,861
Yeah.
Yes.

1483
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:53,880
Is it,
and this is stop.

1484
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:55,290
You can stop.
It's not,

1485
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,510
we're not good.
These mother fuckers are ready to come

1486
01:04:57,511 --> 01:05:01,980
out with the iphone 11 then like the guy
you're not going to stop been at the web

1487
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,220
was invented hyperlinks.
And the idea was that if someone went to

1488
01:05:06,221 --> 01:05:07,290
hog dude,
this is just,

1489
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,910
oh I'm in,
I'm in.

1490
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,950
So like the guy invented the web stolen
the time and I should know his name.

1491
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,650
Gore mother fucker hover,
right.

1492
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,000
It was funny.
Think you lie.

1493
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,300
So this cat,
this cat a,

1494
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:24,130
all he wanted to do was make it
basically we're like medical documents

1495
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,870
where you would,
where you would say like,

1496
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:28,900
you know this guy had a brain transplant
and then brain transplant will be

1497
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:32,200
underlined and you clicked on that and
it would take you to a link that

1498
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:35,620
explained brain transplants and that
would be worldwide.

1499
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:41,010
So the Internet is decentralized and the
web is decentralized to some degree.

1500
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,900
Okay.
Now Google coming in with search

1501
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:45,730
engines,
like that's focusing points.

1502
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,650
What scares me is those people being
like facebook being the avenue in

1503
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:53,770
whichever it be talks like I,
I should scare you is a weed I just

1504
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:57,340
handed you holy Shit.
I took two hits and I'm not even here

1505
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:01,600
anymore.
I'm an anti yet I am very high.

1506
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,790
That's a blunt.
That's legit.

1507
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,540
It took two hits.
I liked a little bit louder.

1508
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:10,240
I'll fuck around here in California Sun.
But you know what I mean?

1509
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:13,840
Like I just have a problem with the
centralization of the companies owning

1510
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,820
the avenues in which get taught.
I right,

1511
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:17,290
I'm right.
I'm right with you on that.

1512
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,240
I think we need more youtube.
I think we need more venues for people

1513
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:24,430
to distribute,
distribute information.

1514
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,750
But I also think we need more love,
more compassion.

1515
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,060
There's so much hate and anger towards
each other.

1516
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,220
I feel like I'm going to get dark nailed
here on this because I'm not,

1517
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,510
I am not.
It's part of the nervousness about doing

1518
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:39,550
a live show right after Bush while you
were talking.

1519
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:40,890
I would say,
um,

1520
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:41,651
well,
I mean I'm not,

1521
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:44,710
I'm very nervous right now.
I have a fucking drink.

1522
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,170
But,
but I would say five.

1523
01:06:46,171 --> 01:06:47,110
It's,
I'm very nervous.

1524
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,360
I would say that.
Um,

1525
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,210
oh,
this is one of those ones were there.

1526
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:51,240
That's,
yeah,

1527
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,370
it's tobacco,
tobacco and some shit that was grown on

1528
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:56,800
Mars.
You know,

1529
01:06:56,801 --> 01:07:01,801
Armstrong groups we man,
see I again,

1530
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,260
again,
it was just like there was a point when

1531
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:07,150
you're trying to make sense right now.
This is part of the problem,

1532
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:07,841
right?
I know.

1533
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:09,550
This is why I wanted us to get here and
we're getting,

1534
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:12,400
we're getting super serious about topics
that are very,

1535
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:15,520
that mean a lot to people and we don't
really know enough about it.

1536
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,260
I just,
I just feel like,

1537
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:20,080
I just wish that there weren't,
like,

1538
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,220
again,
I just,

1539
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:24,760
I feel like there's reps that have
people have to fall in to communicate

1540
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:27,620
and there and there are ruts that are
owned by these companies that,

1541
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,690
that are very fucking rich and varied.
Here's the thing too.

1542
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:33,790
These companies didn't see this.
Like I'm libertarian,

1543
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,120
I'm not either way.
And just in the sense I'm not really

1544
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:38,740
that,
I don't even fucking know what that is.

1545
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,820
All I know is I don't believe in
trusting anybody who,

1546
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,950
who says,
Hey,

1547
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,870
I'll take care of you.
Come this way.

1548
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:49,450
Just don't worry about a thing.
And they're the ones making all the

1549
01:07:49,451 --> 01:07:50,410
money.
And it's like,

1550
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:53,830
that's how the Internet has become.
It used to be a wild west of

1551
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:56,920
information.
Emails are fucking information that is,

1552
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:00,280
that's me communicating with you and no
one else seeing it.

1553
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,070
That's beautiful.
And I think the idea of twitter and

1554
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:05,590
facebook and all that,
it's fantastic when it first started,

1555
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,650
but at the this point in time,
it's gotten so big,

1556
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,920
if it doesn't break up into something
where people figure out that they are in

1557
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,050
control of the Internet,
not these other people.

1558
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:15,980
That's what it bothers me.
Okay.

1559
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,470
So what bothers you?
Is it someone comes along and says the

1560
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:20,030
people aren't in control of the
Internet,

1561
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:21,950
so it's not like a free market.
The free,

1562
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:23,003
hold on,
sorry.

1563
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,520
It was a free market.
It's a free market.

1564
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:27,890
A guy like Alex Jones,
you'd say this guy is preposterous.

1565
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:31,130
I'm not listening to him anymore.
When it's not a free market is when

1566
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,330
youtube collapse.
Well,

1567
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,300
I dunno if they collaborate.
If they just all agree.

1568
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,910
I don't know if they all agree,
but they just all decide everyone's

1569
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:40,370
going to take them off.
Facebook's gonna suspend him for 30

1570
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:41,840
days.
Twitter's going to suspend it for a

1571
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:43,640
period of time.
Youtube is going to remove them.

1572
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,880
All these people are going to take vimeo
jumped on ship and they pulled them off

1573
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:48,110
too.
So this,

1574
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:53,111
this becomes an issue like what is it
that causes you to get removed?

1575
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:58,160
What is it and should we be really clear
on that or is this just a whim because

1576
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:01,310
this is a really important thing.
If we really are fucking with free

1577
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,490
speech we have to be very careful on
what we decide.

1578
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:09,770
Is is a valid reason to pull people off
of our airways?

1579
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:14,930
Because if you have stuff on your
airways that's far more vile and you let

1580
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,780
that stay up because it doesn't have the
same reach,

1581
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:20,810
like what is your criteria?
It doesn't have the same influence.

1582
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,270
It doesn't have the same political ties
to it.

1583
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:25,970
Like,
what is the reason why you're pulling

1584
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:29,420
one thing off and not another thing?
Is it because of the popularity issue?

1585
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:34,660
Have you searched your trillions of
fucking hours of footage for offensive

1586
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:37,250
speech,
content,

1587
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:40,940
ideas,
disinformation,

1588
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,000
what have you,
what have you really done to mitigate

1589
01:09:44,001 --> 01:09:49,001
this issue or are you acting on this
because it's a social hotspot issue

1590
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:51,710
right now,
which it most certainly is and most

1591
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:52,670
certainly should be.

1592
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,820
I really think that Alex needs a guy
right next to him.

1593
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,670
He really like,
I understand this and I did a show

1594
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:01,400
together and Howard Stern,
man,

1595
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,200
no,
not the same comparison.

1596
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:05,960
I guess Howard's but listen man,
let's do him every day.

1597
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:07,880
But sometimes I want to be like,
dude,

1598
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,790
are you kidding me?
But that's also part of his charm,

1599
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:14,180
part of his charm and she creates
descent in arguments and you want to get

1600
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:17,060
mad and you want to either he's
opinionated well,

1601
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,760
but how it's turns very responsible.
He's a different guy.

1602
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,320
It's not,
it's not the same thing.

1603
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:24,260
I'm not trying to compare Alex to him.
I'm just saying that sometimes I feel

1604
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,990
the same way about it.
About him and it had to feel that way

1605
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:31,130
about us right now.
This is quit cutting fucking Giorgio

1606
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:33,050
moroder tribute records and do a country
record.

1607
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:34,910
You know,
and I do a country record right now and

1608
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:35,301
they're like,
oh,

1609
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:36,020
it's kind of corny.

1610
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,080
No.
Uh,

1611
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,070
now I got a record coming by the way.
I'm sure you do,

1612
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,770
Dude.
I told you I wake up the Triscuit deca

1613
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,500
phobia every morning.
In fact,

1614
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,170
that's the Stephen King.
I will,

1615
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:50,210
uh,
I'm going to fucking set it so people

1616
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:52,370
know I'm not bullshitting.
I'm going to set my alarm.

1617
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:54,590
What time's it right now?
It's two oh five.

1618
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:59,510
I'm going to set my alarm for two oh
five two oh five perfect.

1619
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:03,320
Five triscuit,
decorative phobia.

1620
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,330
You know,
I also just,

1621
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:08,240
just along with what you're saying is
it's like,

1622
01:11:08,241 --> 01:11:08,871
you know,
Oh,

1623
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:11,630
it is two oh five guy.
It has to be free.

1624
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:14,220
Hold the whole sentence.
No,

1625
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,480
it's two.
Oh.

1626
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:20,220
Oh Oh you're a cathode ray light or
clock is things bullshit.

1627
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,690
Oh,
it just turned two oh six.

1628
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,990
Come on pitch.
Why don't you go on?

1629
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,240
Hmm.
Try it.

1630
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:32,900
Thinks I'm retarded.
Let's go with 2:08 PM that's fact.

1631
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,100
That's why we give ourselves a little
buffer.

1632
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,900
No,
I just feel like,

1633
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,670
you know,
and I fucking,

1634
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:41,620
this topic could be,
we know we're not,

1635
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,800
we're not qualified to have this
conversation,

1636
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,220
but no one is.
Yeah.

1637
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,160
So it's just,
as long as we're honest about how we

1638
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:48,090
feel about things.
Look,

1639
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,800
I didn't go,
oh you guys are off.

1640
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:51,390
You guys are off.
They were a little off.

1641
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,700
I believe.
I believe in protecting children's

1642
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,390
innocence in a certain way that I,
I agree with youtube not allowing porn

1643
01:11:57,391 --> 01:11:58,171
and stuff like that,
you know,

1644
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:01,440
because like my kids look at youtube all
the time,

1645
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,470
but what about twitter,
twitter or loss?

1646
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,090
A certain amount of porn.
Sometimes we flipping through my time,

1647
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,560
my phone down,
I gotta go Yo Kendra la slow at town.

1648
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,840
Yeah.
Nice call out.

1649
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:13,951
Yeah,
I mean,

1650
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:15,110
you know,
it may as well have like,

1651
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:20,270
I believe if Isis,
if Alex Jones and if the unboxing of the

1652
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:23,880
Lolz can exist,
what does that mean?

1653
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,240
Like oils,
my daughter,

1654
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:28,080
these toys,
lls,

1655
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:31,770
shopkins and things like that where they
show videos of them are the slime videos

1656
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:34,980
of doing this,
like youtube and those kinds of things.

1657
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,670
I just think that there is a certain
level of like,

1658
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,500
just ignore it.
If you don't like it.

1659
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,960
Well it's not your thing.
The lawsuit thing.

1660
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,440
Totally.
That's out of this context a little bit.

1661
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,500
He went too far with that big difference
between something that you might find

1662
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:51,990
gross and something that changes
culture.

1663
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:56,220
I think what they're worried about is,
do you remember when Jim Acosta did

1664
01:12:56,221 --> 01:12:56,820
that?
Uh,

1665
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,070
he went to that trump rally and they
went crazy on him.

1666
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:00,653
Do you remember that shit?

1667
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:02,220
I don't know.
Is it a recent thing?

1668
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:07,110
Weeks ago?
This is CNN anchor who is reasonably

1669
01:13:07,111 --> 01:13:10,380
self righteous,
but he's in a difficult situation.

1670
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,900
He's,
he has to challenge the president of the

1671
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:16,500
United States who is also a famous
celebrity billionaire guy.

1672
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:20,370
What's his name on buildings?
I mean this literally is Rosebud.

1673
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,810
This is,
this is the tale of citizen Kane.

1674
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,530
I mean,
this is someone with an ungodly power

1675
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:31,890
and influence and this gym,
and I'm not standing up for Jim Acosta.

1676
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,470
I'm just going to say,
just put yourself in that guy's

1677
01:13:34,471 --> 01:13:36,450
position.
What a crazy spot.

1678
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,360
You're yelling out.
Questions at the president of United

1679
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,980
States who also happens to be Donald
Trump.

1680
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:45,981
You think like you're on acid the world.
The world has gone into a vortex of

1681
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:51,210
crazy and you're the guy by some fucking
freak of chance,

1682
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:54,180
whether you're Jim Acosta or don lemon
or,

1683
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,630
or fill in the blank.
Everyone up,

1684
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,480
it went off.
You heard it,

1685
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,550
he hit the button.
I accidentally hit the button to do this

1686
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:07,470
correctly,
but it mean if you're one of those

1687
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:09,000
fucking people,
I'm going to hold this picture.

1688
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:10,800
It was the weed.
Oh Shit.

1689
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:11,634
I've got to that off

1690
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:15,610
for a few seconds ago.
If you're one of those fucking people

1691
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:19,240
and that's your job,
and we expect them to handle that.

1692
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:24,310
That's probably like being beyonce and
the rock on steroids,

1693
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,850
you know?
But,

1694
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,410
but in a negative way,
it wouldn't be those two because those

1695
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:33,490
are like very beloved celebrities.
Like very few people are as beloved as

1696
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:37,160
the rock or beyonce.
They're pretty much universally beloved,

1697
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,520
the person uniquely so they're so loved
and so deserving of that love.

1698
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:46,420
Uh,
but if you're a guy like who's a like a

1699
01:14:46,421 --> 01:14:48,220
real like Takashi six,
nine,

1700
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:51,130
that kid like you imagine the hate that
guy gets all day.

1701
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,950
Now imagine what's that?
He said six.

1702
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:59,010
He's a rapper listening
every morning I wake up,

1703
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:04,390
see my friend.
I hope this doesn't get off pulled off

1704
01:15:04,391 --> 01:15:06,120
of youtube.
Alex,

1705
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,300
can we do that whole thing?

1706
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:15,490
Shooter Jennings Bitch recognize.
Oh you brought an album delivered.

1707
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,260
We can sign off.
Oh beautiful.

1708
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,080
I love it.
Thanks Adam.

1709
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,050
You got some bad ass.
It's

1710
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,620
fucking music.
Thanks.

1711
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,420
You really do.
I love your music and you know,

1712
01:15:29,421 --> 01:15:31,490
one of the things I love about your
music is like,

1713
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,830
um,
it's all different man.

1714
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:37,400
You got some straight up country,
put the o back in country.

1715
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,400
You got to that,
you've got that,

1716
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:43,190
that whole album man.
This is like a bad ass country album,

1717
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,740
you know.
But like with this twist,

1718
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:50,980
like a respectful country album that
also has a lot of like modern wickedness

1719
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:52,580
to it.
You know,

1720
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,400
I appreciate that was the point.
Like when we were,

1721
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,780
when we were doing the first record,
it was me and Ted Wrestle camp.

1722
01:15:59,781 --> 01:16:02,900
He still plays with me and Leroy pal who
doesn't play with me anymore,

1723
01:16:02,901 --> 01:16:04,520
but he played on that record.
He played guitar.

1724
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,280
Brian Kaylin was a drummer.
We started doing our shit.

1725
01:16:07,281 --> 01:16:09,980
Like our idea was we were living here,
you know,

1726
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:12,800
I just,
I had 2003 we started recording the

1727
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:16,070
first record and I had met her three
years ago and we were like,

1728
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,520
our whole thing was like,
we like rock music because it sounds

1729
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:20,150
cool.

1730
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:22,100
And we like Dylan and we like,
you know,

1731
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:23,840
even,
I wasn't even smart enough to like Dylan

1732
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:26,240
then we were like into fucking,
you know,

1733
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:31,010
Bowie and I was,
I can't came for the nine inch nails

1734
01:16:31,011 --> 01:16:32,870
side get it.
That's how I got into music.

1735
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,430
We kind of talked about that near the
show.

1736
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,510
But,
uh,

1737
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:40,160
like by that time the idea was like,
can we make country music?

1738
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:44,000
We like the old stuff but have it sound
cool and why can't we bring in like the

1739
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:48,200
stuff that raw that's cool about rock
and why can't you go psychedelic and why

1740
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:51,320
can't you kind of push the limits that
way.

1741
01:16:51,321 --> 01:16:54,530
And we were just dumb and trying to do
it that way.

1742
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:56,510
And Dave Cobb,
who produced this record,

1743
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,510
we met,
we met that back then and he produced

1744
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:02,000
the first record and he was the same
way.

1745
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,870
We were like more Beatles stones,
Bowie kids musically in the,

1746
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:09,710
in the amount of records we listened to,
you know,

1747
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,960
obsessed over pink floyd and stuff,
you know,

1748
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,860
then we were a country.
So we were kind of trying to blend those

1749
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:17,630
two back then.
I,

1750
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:18,800
you know,
but we were just,

1751
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,770
just trying and starting and doing weird
shit.

1752
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:26,300
And then after a while just evolving.
Um,

1753
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,190
yeah,
but the album would be totally

1754
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,860
different.
Like you don't give a fuck dude.

1755
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,670
It's about the guy who invested in apple
in the eighties

1756
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:39,020
you just,
you just do your music,

1757
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,950
man,
you do your music and whatever you're

1758
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:44,390
into right now is like what you do.
It's really interesting,

1759
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:44,830
like,
oh,

1760
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:45,720
I appreciate that.
And that,

1761
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,940
I mean,
I've listened to,

1762
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,660
I've listened to every one of your cds
and there's only a few of them that are

1763
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:52,280
even similar,
you know,

1764
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:53,360
similar to each other.

1765
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,580
They're all,
they're all,

1766
01:17:54,581 --> 01:17:56,870
all your albums,
I guess you can say albums again.

1767
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:01,160
These two cause became cd for awhile.
But who the fuck gets a CD old man.

1768
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,280
And then it's like,
I can't say online playlist.

1769
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,500
You newest online playlist.
They're like,

1770
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:09,290
what do I say about your newest stems?
Our playlist man.

1771
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:11,600
Audio release.
Yeah man.

1772
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,830
Uh,
no.

1773
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,230
You know what's black ribbons happen
man?

1774
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:20,231
I did the first record and that was kind
of my take on country and our take as a

1775
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:24,350
band and Dave cobb and then,
but before that record came out,

1776
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,840
we started recording the second record
and I was like,

1777
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,810
the first song I wrote was a song
electric Rodeo.

1778
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,830
And we,
and I was like,

1779
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,680
I wanted to go heavy.
I wanted to like,

1780
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:38,890
just really show up and like do this
kind of hard rocky sounding.

1781
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:40,970
And what I mean by that is like,
you know,

1782
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:44,300
fucking we're into Zeplin and shit,
like nineties music.

1783
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,860
It was like,
uh,

1784
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:47,250
you know,
seventies ship.

1785
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:50,360
But it was like hard rock,
crazy effects.

1786
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:53,030
Immigrants saw kind of going crazy.
But with the song,

1787
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:56,690
the country songs there.
And I always felt if electric rodeo got

1788
01:18:56,691 --> 01:19:00,590
considered a country record when it came
out and charted than I felt we,

1789
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,700
like we had done our thing.
But it did come out and it did chart.

1790
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:09,050
But once we came out with that,
we had universal who had been behind us

1791
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:12,800
and they had basically been the,
the people that worked at universal had

1792
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:17,801
been kind of in my opinion and their
opinion duped because Tony Brown and Tim

1793
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:23,810
to Blah,
who believed in me and we had done this

1794
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:28,370
record without a deal and I sent it to
Tony Brown cause I knew I just as a kid

1795
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:32,090
had met him and him and my dad had done
business and I liked him and there was,

1796
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:35,240
he had made me feel like he liked me.

1797
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:38,450
So I sent him this record after me and
the band.

1798
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:42,590
And Dave did the record and uh,
they believed in me and they signed it

1799
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:46,970
and he kind of like remixed our first
song so they would play it on radio.

1800
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,400
And Tony was a big producer,
still is.

1801
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:53,630
I mean he produced the first bunch Steve
Earle records and he played piano for

1802
01:19:53,631 --> 01:19:55,870
Elvis.
Like he and he was our label heads,

1803
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:57,830
so he kinda remixed it.
So we get on radio.

1804
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:02,390
So I'm thinking they like me cause we
have like kind of a 20 number 24 yet.

1805
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:04,250
So I'm like,
I'm going to hit him with some good shit

1806
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:06,180
now.
And then I hit him with what I thought

1807
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,040
was a good shit and they said,
this is

1808
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,660
not what we signed up for.
We are out,

1809
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,790
you're out.
And I never got played on radio again.

1810
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,713
So,
you know,

1811
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,810
that's all stuff that's on them,
dude.

1812
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,470
I know.
It's the reason why your music is so

1813
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,470
well.
It's just good.

1814
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,690
I mean I like,
I like a lot of great music and your

1815
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:24,030
music is great,
but it's also that you,

1816
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:26,850
you're clearly coming at this from an
artist perspective.

1817
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:30,060
You're not a marketing genius by any
stretch of the imagination,

1818
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,090
right?
Your Dad's fucking waylon jennings dude.

1819
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:38,070
I mean you have the end of all ends.
You're dad is like a super legend,

1820
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,930
you know?
I mean these are super,

1821
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:43,440
super legend,
but you choose to legitimately carve

1822
01:20:43,441 --> 01:20:45,450
your own path in this the wildest of
ways.

1823
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:49,440
It's really interesting how you do that
and I think that thoughtfulness that

1824
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:52,680
allows you to be free like that is also
what allows you to explore these like

1825
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,520
complex issues like censorship or bit
coin or any of these things that are

1826
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:57,031
like,
whoa,

1827
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:58,800
this is like,
this is some heavy stuff.

1828
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,060
Like you've,
you're,

1829
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:03,210
you're,
you have a you of a curious approach to

1830
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:07,110
these things and in a,
in a an ability to express who you

1831
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:08,340
really are,
right?

1832
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:10,230
Which is what,
what comes out in your music.

1833
01:21:10,231 --> 01:21:13,350
It's not like your image,
you're just doing what you really feel

1834
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:16,890
when you're writing it.
That I think that's a,

1835
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:20,910
that's a big part of a community that's
a big part of being a person.

1836
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:23,430
Like let some person uniquely be
themselves.

1837
01:21:23,431 --> 01:21:26,130
And I think there's,
this is one of the real issue with

1838
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:31,110
social media as people are so terrified
of expressing themselves because they're

1839
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,170
terrified of the hate they get back.
But then they get addicted to attacking

1840
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:37,470
other people that are failing or other
people that are making mistakes.

1841
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,410
And that I get,
I think this again goes with this whole

1842
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:42,600
fucking chaos thing that we're talking
about before.

1843
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:46,560
I mean I think we're in the middle of a
storm right now and I think that your,

1844
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:50,250
your take on Alex Jones and Bill Maher's
take on Alex Jones and what we're saying

1845
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:51,720
here about them,
it doesn't,

1846
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:56,370
it like it doesn't in any way negate
arguments that you shouldn't say some of

1847
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:58,620
the things he's saying we agree with
you.

1848
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:02,490
But we also say human beings,
we have to figure this out together.

1849
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:07,610
And if you start conflict and one great
way to start conflict is to ban and to

1850
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:12,060
take people down popio call people in
Nazi that aren't really a Nazi,

1851
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,480
like decide that someone's an outright
white supremacists when they're really

1852
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:17,370
not at all.
There are liberal and a Democrat and you

1853
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:19,410
know they are,
you're saying crazy things you could to

1854
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:21,510
try to demonize people and slot them
into groups.

1855
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:26,720
We have to reject that with every fiber
of our being because this is tyranny.

1856
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:32,280
This is the type of group tyranny that
although it's not connected to a network

1857
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,930
like the fucking,
you know,

1858
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:37,350
the KKK or the Democrats or the
Republicans,

1859
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,400
it's still this chaotic group.
Think thing that happens.

1860
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,880
What we decided to go after people and
stop being compassionate,

1861
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:48,450
stop being just a human being who
recognizes that other human beings are

1862
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:51,480
flawed and they make mistakes and they
do stupid shit,

1863
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,950
but as soon as you oppose them so
vehemently for something that really

1864
01:22:55,951 --> 01:23:00,000
should be treated with curiosity and
compassion and maybe a little bit of

1865
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:04,650
understanding and mockery instead of
that there's this anger and this vitriol

1866
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:08,200
that we just have to put a curb on
shitty thinking.

1867
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,600
I agree.
It's kind of like new Roman Colosseum,

1868
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:12,220
social media,
and it is in a way,

1869
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:14,380
but it's also,
it's fighting each court,

1870
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:17,620
cheering it on.
The court of public discourse is massive

1871
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:18,190
now.

1872
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:20,650
It just opened up a gate.
It was a little trickle.

1873
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:23,470
It was like that fucking border patrol
station in Mexico.

1874
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:25,180
It's hard to get in the country,
Bro.

1875
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:28,450
If you want to do,
be that guy or risks his life in the

1876
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,490
middle of August and take your family
through the fucking desert with a couple

1877
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:33,550
of jugs of water and you're going to
walk and hope you find a job.

1878
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,920
You know?
That's what it used to be like,

1879
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:38,800
hey,
this is like is the walls came down and

1880
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:41,680
they changed the law and everybody said,
go ahead in.

1881
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:46,920
And everybody's in Wa and the end and
down to people going down to up and

1882
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:48,700
down.
Just opening it up.

1883
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:50,680
It's getting crazy.
See,

1884
01:23:50,681 --> 01:23:53,200
this is what everybody's afraid of and
this is what,

1885
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:55,690
this is what's happening right now with
information.

1886
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,970
This is what's happening for the very
first time ever,

1887
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,080
but between this period of 1994 and 2018
it's been this inevitable change in the

1888
01:24:04,601 --> 01:24:08,290
way people are able to express
information and who gets to express

1889
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:09,124
information.

1890
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,560
You know,
they'll question the legitimacy of

1891
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:15,610
someone who becomes famous to the
Internet but not famous through NBC.

1892
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:18,400
He made it.
He's on NBC.

1893
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:21,310
Meanwhile,
this guy is just talking to his Webcam.

1894
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:24,310
He has 30 times as many people paying
attention to him.

1895
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,800
Why is he wrong?
Why is the incorrect?

1896
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:30,040
Because he didn't go through your
established channels that have existed

1897
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:33,130
with WHO's your gatekeepers?
Oh guys like Harvey Weinstein.

1898
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:36,430
Where your gatekeepers bitch,
get the fuck outta here.

1899
01:24:36,431 --> 01:24:40,120
You don't get to dictate what's
interesting or what's creative or what

1900
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:42,940
sounds good.
What kind of music people like.

1901
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:46,780
It used to be that if you like rock,
you didn't like country when I was a

1902
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,060
kid.
You are a loser if you like kiss,

1903
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,320
right dude,
you,

1904
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:52,640
you,
you would get like categorize.

1905
01:24:52,641 --> 01:24:55,810
I had to hide some music that I liked
and kiss was one of them.

1906
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,270
I told,
I told Paul,

1907
01:24:58,271 --> 01:25:02,680
Stanley didn't seem to appreciate that.
I told Gene Simmons ones too.

1908
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:03,341
I was like,
dude,

1909
01:25:03,341 --> 01:25:04,930
I'm sorry.
But it was true.

1910
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:09,040
I was loyal back when it was uncool to
like kiss and then it turned around and

1911
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:12,160
became super lawyer of Eddie Bravo has
to save story.

1912
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:15,160
We both were like embarrassed to be
kissed fans,

1913
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:17,680
but meanwhile,
now I fucking love kiss.

1914
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,610
I love kiss,
but I,

1915
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,520
you know,
I also,

1916
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:24,370
I also love Willie Nelson.
You know,

1917
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:26,740
I love listening to all kinds of
different shit.

1918
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,490
It doesn't connect mutually exclusive.
Like for me,

1919
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:32,980
I didn't,
I grew up with my dad and had country

1920
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:36,190
came along.
Like once I started living life and I

1921
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:38,920
started appreciating the songs,
you know what I mean?

1922
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:41,920
Uh,
like when you started actually kind of

1923
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:44,470
understanding the words and all that,
and like you,

1924
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,570
it just,
it hits you like,

1925
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:47,610
Oh shit,
this,

1926
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,790
this shit is like the heavy shit.
It's like there's some deep,

1927
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:54,100
deep fucking emotions to country songs.
I mean,

1928
01:25:54,101 --> 01:25:58,210
Johnny Cash just as lyrics alone,
like some of his songs are fucking

1929
01:25:58,211 --> 01:25:59,950
phenomenal men.
Yeah.

1930
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,520
They're phenomenal.
Yeah.

1931
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,890
You know,
you know what one always blows me away

1932
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:04,040
on

1933
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,140
cash is the man in black still to this
day,

1934
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,680
the lines like uh,
you know the uh,

1935
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:13,040
what is it to the thousands that died
thinking that the Lord we're on their

1936
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:16,370
side and then Harris to the hundreds of
the are tens of thousands that died

1937
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:19,610
thinking that we were all on their side
like that verse and everything.

1938
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,620
I was looking at it,
I forgot to look it up.

1939
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,660
Hey,
would you mind looking up who wrote the

1940
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:26,120
man in black?
Sorry to ask you that.

1941
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:29,000
But I've been dying to know that because
I wanted to know if Shel Silverstein was

1942
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,010
involved or if it was just Johnny Cash
at wrote it.

1943
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:33,350
But that's such a beautiful song,
dude.

1944
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:36,650
How about um,
well folsom prison blues.

1945
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:37,760
All right,
of course.

1946
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,400
Fantastic.
But how about God's going to cut you

1947
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:41,270
down?
Oh,

1948
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,560
that's miss.
These favorite,

1949
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,320
that's a song.
I love that song.

1950
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,720
That's a song they like chills you to
your bone.

1951
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,550
Yeah.
Cause he was an old,

1952
01:26:49,551 --> 01:26:52,030
old man.
We did three songs like the,

1953
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,680
Oh my God,
that's,

1954
01:26:53,681 --> 01:26:54,514
it.
Has that right?

1955
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:56,330
The big kind of like,
yeah,

1956
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,650
Jesus Christ.
That's good.

1957
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:59,330
That one.
And the man comes around.

1958
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:02,930
Those two were really spoken to her.
Oh yeah.

1959
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:05,570
Riddick that Shel Silverstein.
That's why I was wondering.

1960
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:07,760
Yeah.
Shell wrote that Shell's like the

1961
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:11,660
forgot.
He's the guy that brought like the New

1962
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:16,370
York sense of humor and,
and really cultured writing style,

1963
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,210
like the kind of hunters Thompson world.
He's the link between that and country

1964
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:22,040
music for sure.
Shel Silverstein,

1965
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,230
I got to be around him a couple times
when I was young.

1966
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,890
He wrote it.
He though cash wrote the signature song

1967
01:27:27,891 --> 01:27:29,910
man in black.
That's good.

1968
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:32,570
Social conscience behind his wardrobe
choices.

1969
01:27:32,571 --> 01:27:35,390
Just so we're reminded of the ones who
are held back.

1970
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,970
In fact,
he took to black simply because it was

1971
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:41,230
easier to keep clean on long tours.
Yeah.

1972
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:43,130
Look at that.
Early in his career,

1973
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:46,970
a fellow acts teased him about it,
calling him the undertaker.

1974
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,490
Oh Shit.
He was the undertaker for the undertaker

1975
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:51,400
was the undertaker.
Yeah.

1976
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,330
These lyrics could really,
I mean,

1977
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:56,030
there this time right now,
seriously.

1978
01:27:56,270 --> 01:27:58,880
He was a monster man.
Johnny Cash some monster.

1979
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:00,050
Yeah,
he was cool as fuck.

1980
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,340
He's a monster.
Just had a,

1981
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,980
uh,
he just had this energy about him.

1982
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:07,700
Are those like colace zero [inaudible]
that's a,

1983
01:28:07,701 --> 01:28:08,720
it's a,
um,

1984
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:13,550
I like doctor Stevie,
a flavored beverage so it doesn't have

1985
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:16,020
any calories.
It's free guilt,

1986
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,600
free mouth,
pleasure,

1987
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,153
mouth,
pleasure.

1988
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:20,660
Um,
he had a,

1989
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:24,470
he had songs that were,
there's so many of them that were just,

1990
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:28,220
if you think about the time that he was
riding them and to come up through the

1991
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:31,220
son scene and Elvis and all that,
that was a weird thing.

1992
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,080
He came in through Memphis.
Yeah.

1993
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,240
Yeah.
He's a beast man.

1994
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,580
No question.
And it seemed like he kind of died on

1995
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:39,440
his own terms.
He died like a man.

1996
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:42,530
He died after June died.
It was like right after June died.

1997
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,660
That was also the way he was handling it
too,

1998
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:45,920
you know?
Yeah.

1999
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:47,930
I wouldn't do that.
Nine inch nails song.

2000
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,093
Yeah.
Hurt.

2001
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:49,641
Yeah.
Yeah.

2002
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:51,160
That was awesome.
That was intense.

2003
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,820
Intense.
How I see it.

2004
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:54,200
You see if you give us and the
mushrooms,

2005
01:28:54,201 --> 01:28:56,530
the first time I saw that video,
I was in my room,

2006
01:28:56,660 --> 01:29:00,170
my old here in La and the star gun
house,

2007
01:29:00,171 --> 01:29:01,950
that was the pink house over

2008
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,950
by the Tom Cat Theater on Santa Monica
Boulevard.

2009
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:05,820
You know what I'm talking about?
And,

2010
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:07,410
and uh,
no Harris Nude,

2011
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,900
the place where you can go in there.
Oh,

2012
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,100
I heard where's it and take pictures of
women.

2013
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:14,440
It's Santa Monica and Gardner.
Anyway,

2014
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:16,500
this little pink house we had over there
and uh,

2015
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,870
I was watching that video on mushrooms
and I was like,

2016
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:21,420
fucking Goddamn,
like,

2017
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:25,620
let me see this.
You find it.

2018
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:31,440
Find the year 2000.
When did he,

2019
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,910
when did Johnny die?
I think 2005 or three.

2020
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,670
No,
it was like three of those.

2021
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:42,680
And I was living in this apartment on
beverly by the Beverly Center and it was

2022
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:44,900
like a,
I remember that when that happened.

2023
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:45,753
Say three,
Jamie.

2024
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:48,310
Yeah.
Um,

2025
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:52,500
I saw him there.
I got to be random a lot when I was on

2026
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:56,490
the road when I was like,
I'm the first high women record came

2027
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,290
out.
I was F six,

2028
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:00,960
five and we all went on the road.

2029
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,540
And so like Willie's daughters,
amy and Paula,

2030
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:06,780
we're out and no,
actually maybe they were out.

2031
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,370
I think there are the cost drivers in a,
they had the Christian and said their

2032
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:14,070
family and then we went again for high
women too.

2033
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:16,020
But the one,
we were like five year olds.

2034
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:19,770
Uh,
I wish we could play music on this show.

2035
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,750
Oh,
play the highway man song.

2036
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:26,820
Oh Man.
Johnny [inaudible] that man a star ship.

2037
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:31,470
I flew with damn space bar vide and
what?

2038
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:34,730
I rushed to the other side,
man.

2039
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,870
Oh man,
that was,

2040
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:39,300
that was a great fucking album.
It was a great song.

2041
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:41,260
I have those guys all together.
Yeah,

2042
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,740
it was cool to shit snellman produced
that record.

2043
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:45,660
It was,
it was phenomenal shit.

2044
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:49,710
I fly a star ship that's Jimmy Webb
wrote that,

2045
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:50,611
who wrote,
you know,

2046
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:53,730
by the time I get to phoenix a
Galveston,

2047
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:58,820
he wrote a macarthur park,
but he wrote all that motherfucker of a

2048
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:02,250
songwriter and that sounds kind of about
reincarnation.

2049
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,680
It's like the,
his original songs,

2050
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:08,750
but one person who lived through these
different lives and then he ends up at

2051
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,080
simple drop or rain.
Yeah,

2052
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:13,140
Star ship and he was a highway man.
Fuck.

2053
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:15,660
It's amazing.
That's what we're scared.

2054
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:17,670
We're scared of being a single drop of
rain again.

2055
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,010
I had scared.
It'd be so much fun.

2056
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,510
I don't know dude.
I'm having a good time.

2057
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:26,080
I know it wouldn't be easy just to fall
for five seconds for sure.

2058
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,550
For sure.
Absolutely.

2059
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,280
And under the next forever.
How about that?

2060
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:32,010
I bought for billions of years.
How about you go back to me in a single

2061
01:31:32,011 --> 01:31:33,750
cell organism,
you start from scratch,

2062
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,140
go through and you're like,
no way you did it.

2063
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:40,110
It doesn't matter what matters is the
moment.

2064
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:45,350
And that's an impossible concept to
grasp for people who collect stamps and

2065
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,270
a bunch of shit.
Your whole it up in your house because

2066
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:52,080
you're trying to put like some sort of
rigidity to this.

2067
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:55,530
Uh,
if it theory of world that we live in,

2068
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:58,010
you try to put some structure to this
and it doesn't,

2069
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,980
he forgets to enjoy it and I

2070
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,090
think that is part of the point or
earlier too is it's just like,

2071
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:05,080
man,
everybody,

2072
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:08,560
it gets wrapped up.
You said you were talking about when you

2073
01:32:08,561 --> 01:32:10,450
were just afterwards,
but you were talking about it.

2074
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:14,470
Everybody gets sucked up into a,
all these different,

2075
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:19,500
you know,
fucking confrontations all the time and

2076
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:21,910
it's like,
and it takes all of your attention.

2077
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:27,030
Like I think the reason that alums
aren't listened to like they used to be

2078
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:29,260
because we used to have so much time,
man,

2079
01:32:29,261 --> 01:32:31,540
he used to sit in your room and that's
all you had.

2080
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,710
And now there's this constant focus.
It's like there's a way,

2081
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,000
and I think the only answer is there's
going to have to be some established

2082
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:44,260
decentralization of the Internet,
the returns it to the form in which all

2083
01:32:44,261 --> 01:32:47,350
can exist digitally as they do
physically,

2084
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,520
just like we do now.

2085
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:51,850
And we're going to have to figure it out
as this design.

2086
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:52,661
It's coming,
dude.

2087
01:32:52,661 --> 01:32:55,060
I don't think anyone's going to be able
to stop it.

2088
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:55,840
No.
Reg,

2089
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,780
one of the things that's interesting is
that the people at the very top of the

2090
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,180
heap,
um,

2091
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:04,270
we always thought were the proponents of
free speech.

2092
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:05,910
We,
we always thought that the,

2093
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:10,540
the repressive people where the right
wing conservative people that wanted to

2094
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:15,310
stop progress and stop nudity and people
smoking pot and you know,

2095
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:18,160
and Tipper Gore wants a bad rap music.
I remember all that.

2096
01:33:18,161 --> 01:33:21,000
That's what we always thought.
It's actually Tipper Gore was Democrats.

2097
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:24,870
That's a very bad analogy.
Tipper Gore was Al Gore's wife Tipper

2098
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:26,200
Gore put this,
but she had to speak.

2099
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:27,400
She had the stickers.
Stickers.

2100
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:30,610
Yeah.
Explicitly or not some fucking old

2101
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:32,500
school ice tea and blew her wig.

2102
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:39,660
But we always that that's a bad example
because she wasn't democratic it sample,

2103
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,900
but it is an example of like forget
about Democrats or Republicans.

2104
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,690
It's basically people in power trying to
control other folks.

2105
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:47,651
This would be this,
this,

2106
01:33:47,651 --> 01:33:49,420
this has been going on forever,
right.

2107
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,030
It's just what people do.
But we always thought of it as being the

2108
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:54,220
conservative ones that were like the
most,

2109
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:58,630
the the most into suppression of free
speech,

2110
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,150
you know,
stop people you're swearing stopped the

2111
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:03,640
knew that he stopped the pornography.
It was always thought of as being a

2112
01:34:03,641 --> 01:34:06,640
conservative thing.
But I would argue like today it's almost

2113
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:11,641
like your behavior is more restricted on
the left than it is even on the right.

2114
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:15,670
The right is seemed to be more relaxed
in terms of like what they're willing to

2115
01:34:15,671 --> 01:34:18,580
let people do.
But the left is like putting up all

2116
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:22,410
these boundaries for like what people
can and can't say doing.

2117
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:24,340
Don't do,
like Tom sent me this,

2118
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:25,910
a Thompson,
Laura sent me this um,

2119
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:30,100
photograph of a,
some sort of a sketch comedy group where

2120
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:34,090
they were trying to figure out what you
can and can't do today and like what,

2121
01:34:34,091 --> 01:34:38,710
what is okay to do in a sketch?
And it was a lot of it was about gay

2122
01:34:38,711 --> 01:34:42,760
people and Trans People.
And can you be a Wa a straight CIS man

2123
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,710
playing a trans person,
all caps?

2124
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:48,400
Absolutely not.
Can you be assist purse or can you be a

2125
01:34:48,401 --> 01:34:51,910
trans person playing a CIS person?
Yes.

2126
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:54,850
All caps.
You could do whatever you want.

2127
01:34:54,851 --> 01:34:58,100
If you're a trans person who's a woman,
you can play

2128
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,250
a man and that's totally cool.
But if you're a shooter jennings and you

2129
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:02,084
go,
you know what man,

2130
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:04,880
I just think it would be cool.
Do a movie where I play a chick.

2131
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,880
No chance buddy.
You're not allowed to make believe in

2132
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:10,130
that way.
You can't make believe in a certain way.

2133
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:14,510
They're basically saying your,
your thoughts are not allowed to go down

2134
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:16,730
these roads.
There is no way you could manage this

2135
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:21,731
respectfully and with with enough
people who are crazy.

2136
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:26,240
But this is my point.
These people exist and they're on the

2137
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:29,240
left now.
They're like super inclusive,

2138
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:31,880
you know,
super worried about diversity,

2139
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,660
super worried about,
you know,

2140
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:38,630
people of color and there's all these
like gain weird words thrown around game

2141
01:35:38,631 --> 01:35:41,000
words.
I wish George Carlin was alive.

2142
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,140
He would have a heart attack.
No,

2143
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,920
I just want to tell him again.
You'd bring them back to life.

2144
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:49,130
Tell him again with a hard day.
He would say what's similar to what

2145
01:35:49,131 --> 01:35:50,210
you're saying,
what I'm saying?

2146
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:51,560
I think,
but probably better.

2147
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,110
He would just tell he'd be so,
yeah.

2148
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:56,630
I just want to know.
I guess it would die to know what he

2149
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:58,100
would say.
This is,

2150
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:01,550
I mean to fucking,
to use the title of my tour.

2151
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:05,450
These are strange times,
legitimately strange times stranger than

2152
01:36:05,451 --> 01:36:07,280
we've ever experienced before as a human
race.

2153
01:36:07,281 --> 01:36:08,200
I think.
Yeah.

2154
01:36:08,201 --> 01:36:08,841
Oh,
I think so.

2155
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:09,830
I think we're on the,
uh,

2156
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,920
beginning of it.
That's the fucked up thing is I think

2157
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:15,860
that like the Cha,
the Internet is the thing,

2158
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:19,010
the Lynch pin that change society in
such a way,

2159
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,730
like you said,
the adolescent phase is what dorm do

2160
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:25,490
these dorm of fame.
It's a God damn hailstorm.

2161
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,640
You ever seen those hail storms when
they hit those Ohio backyards and fuck

2162
01:36:28,641 --> 01:36:32,510
up the pool and everybody's in Scott
screaming and you're hearing the house,

2163
01:36:32,511 --> 01:36:34,130
like it's getting attacked by rocks.

2164
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:36,860
That's what it is.
It's one of those hail storms of

2165
01:36:36,861 --> 01:36:38,810
information,
you know?

2166
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:39,740
Yeah,
man,

2167
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:42,320
there's never been anything like it.
It's good.

2168
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,540
That's good.
But we just gotta be nice to each other.

2169
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:46,250
We're all together in this thing
together.

2170
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,720
That's the thing too,
man.

2171
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,310
And people are nice.
Other people,

2172
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:51,170
a nice back.
This is the thing.

2173
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,030
We've got to realize that if you're
nice,

2174
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:55,160
other people would be nice to,
we've got gotta be nice to each other

2175
01:36:55,161 --> 01:36:57,620
and that includes online,
you know,

2176
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,740
and,
and then we've got to be nice about all

2177
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:03,890
the other things in the world.
There's just so much that has to be

2178
01:37:03,891 --> 01:37:06,410
thought of it.
Someone has to be so much that it has to

2179
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:08,960
be thought of.
Not with this idea that you're going to

2180
01:37:08,961 --> 01:37:11,150
live forever because a lot of like the
way we behave,

2181
01:37:11,151 --> 01:37:14,810
it's almost like we think we're going to
live forever instead of having the short

2182
01:37:14,811 --> 01:37:17,680
trip where you're just like kind of be
like,

2183
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:22,010
is friendly with people pot and this is
also something that should be projected.

2184
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:23,930
Right.
I should projected you should project

2185
01:37:23,931 --> 01:37:25,610
that.
We should all get that idea out there so

2186
01:37:25,611 --> 01:37:26,800
that we all agree like,
yeah,

2187
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:27,530
yeah,
yeah.

2188
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:29,360
It was just fucking,
we could do this.

2189
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:32,090
Like even competition.
It doesn't have to be that kind of

2190
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:35,120
conflict.
Even if your neighboring businesses,

2191
01:37:35,121 --> 01:37:37,160
you can be friends and everybody will do
well together.

2192
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,540
There's a lot of people,
man,

2193
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:43,190
this is not a time we have to control
everything and everyone and nor should

2194
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:46,470
you want to.
It's like a big giant summer camp like

2195
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:50,420
life is just one piece of it.
That's a good way to describe it,

2196
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:52,130
dude,
and they have their own summer camp

2197
01:37:52,131 --> 01:37:52,964
that's going to happen,
you know,

2198
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:54,710
or are on their way at the beginning of,
yeah,

2199
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,070
these counselors ain't controlling

2200
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,600
shit.
People are finger banging each other out

2201
01:37:58,850 --> 01:38:01,810
houses,
so it gives gay,

2202
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,900
right.
You can't let a bunch of 14 year olds

2203
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:07,170
run around the forums together.
Fuck every four years.

2204
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,680
The head counselor changes some guy.
It's like last time I was like,

2205
01:38:10,681 --> 01:38:12,030
Oh,
we love that guy and this guy.

2206
01:38:12,031 --> 01:38:12,864
It's like,
no,

2207
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:15,360
nobody from the other neighbor camps are
coming in.

2208
01:38:15,361 --> 01:38:16,194
You're like,
okay.

2209
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:20,100
We vaguely knew when I was in boy
scouts,

2210
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:23,520
we vaguely knew that there was a
potential that one of these camp

2211
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:27,630
counselors might molest you.
Like people knew.

2212
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:30,630
You don't know about him with them.
No one ever did.

2213
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,610
But there was that thought when we were
like,

2214
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,730
I guess I was 13 or something like that
and I was in the boy scouts.

2215
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,740
There was that thought like,
hey man,

2216
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:41,970
this could go fucking sideways anytime
we're in the woods with some dudes,

2217
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:44,220
they want to be in the woods with kids.

2218
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:47,100
Like how well did they vet these people
see different.

2219
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,090
Really,
I have to look at this,

2220
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:52,260
write me that.
Are these people like legit boy Scout,

2221
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:55,290
you know,
instructors or whatever they'd be who

2222
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:57,000
really want to show everybody the way
the woods?

2223
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:58,140
Yes,
most likely.

2224
01:38:58,141 --> 01:38:59,460
They're an,
it's amazing,

2225
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:03,390
amazing experience for young men,
but just as human beings,

2226
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:08,160
anytime you get human beings,
anytime you get a certain group of human

2227
01:39:08,161 --> 01:39:10,800
beings and you leave them alone with
large groups of kids,

2228
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:14,580
Yo,
you gotta be super careful with what

2229
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:18,660
their motives are and how they handle
pressure and how they deal with conflict

2230
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,690
and how they deal with sex.
You know,

2231
01:39:21,691 --> 01:39:23,000
like what do you,
you know,

2232
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:25,440
you ever molested?
Tell me when you were molested,

2233
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:26,320
what happened?
You know,

2234
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,710
like these are,
these are,

2235
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,820
right.
It's a weird issues when you're talking

2236
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:32,520
about dealing with children,
dealing with them.

2237
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,510
The youngest ones are eight and 10 they
had see mine mind 70 10 yeah,

2238
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:39,810
I mean it's just,
it's a weird time when you're watching

2239
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:43,620
little human beings evolve and develop
and you know,

2240
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:44,883
it's her,
most of it.

2241
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:46,110
Let it go to,
you know,

2242
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,430
like for me,
and I know for what the analogy you just

2243
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:53,610
had was perfect.
It is really like summer camp.

2244
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,460
But it's funny how it like,
you know,

2245
01:39:56,461 --> 01:39:59,730
from the day you're born,
the day after somebody else's stem

2246
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,610
summer camp starts at,
it kind of kind of generationally goes

2247
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:07,611
on forever and you kind of like realize
that you're stuck in this like movie in

2248
01:40:07,771 --> 01:40:09,810
which that you have to try and do the
best.

2249
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:12,720
You know?
Like for me it's like do the best with

2250
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:15,840
like your family,
the people you love and then like have

2251
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:18,870
the most fun and do like do the most
damage in a good way.

2252
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,130
Like they,
by the way,

2253
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:22,770
all the people out there in the summer
camp counselors that are mad at me right

2254
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:23,430
now,
this is now,

2255
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:25,790
I'm not saying you're worried about
that.

2256
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:30,840
You feel bad that the vast majority of
your awesome,

2257
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:35,880
we're just talking about just in general
human beings is the sheer numbers of

2258
01:40:35,881 --> 01:40:38,700
human beings.
If you get a certain number of people,

2259
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,430
there's a certain percentage of those
people that are going to be a problem.

2260
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,110
You know,
this is the problem with cops.

2261
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:44,640
It's not,
it's not.

2262
01:40:44,641 --> 01:40:47,010
The cops are bad people.
So when you say fuck cops,

2263
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:48,900
you're crazy,
you're going to need cops.

2264
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,640
Okay.
If something goes wrong at four o'clock

2265
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:51,990
in the morning,
you want the more,

2266
01:40:51,991 --> 01:40:54,040
and who has the courage to stand there
with

2267
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,140
a bulletproof vest and shoot at the bad
guys?

2268
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,070
It's the,
it's the,

2269
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,140
you know,
sam a Sam,

2270
01:40:59,141 --> 01:41:00,850
what's his name from three billboards,
you know,

2271
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,780
it was such a good role.
You know,

2272
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,430
I'm talking about that movie three Zam.
Who's in Sam?

2273
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:08,080
Uh,
comedy.

2274
01:41:08,081 --> 01:41:09,510
So great.
Yeah,

2275
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,350
he was,
he did not see that workers guide from

2276
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:12,131
the gallon.
Oh,

2277
01:41:12,131 --> 01:41:12,961
Sam Elliot.
No,

2278
01:41:12,961 --> 01:41:13,301
no,
no,

2279
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:14,081
no,
no.

2280
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:16,060
We loved not Sam Elliott.
Yeah,

2281
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,130
that's a good one though.
Sometimes the gardens,

2282
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:23,190
you know what else he was in hitchhikers
guide to the galaxy was a great movie

2283
01:41:24,491 --> 01:41:28,000
called Joshua.
He was a z,

2284
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:32,960
Z fod beeblebrox.
I read over and Jimmy Three Bobo,

2285
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,893
they'll words.

2286
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,690
He's,
that role is amazing.

2287
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:39,550
And he's,
he is the moon.

2288
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:40,550
Did you ever see that?
Oh yeah.

2289
01:41:40,551 --> 01:41:41,560
I love it.
We always kid.

2290
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:43,180
Did you,
have you met buoys kit?

2291
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,830
No,
the Dunkin Jones.

2292
01:41:44,831 --> 01:41:46,060
I've never met him,
but he's,

2293
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,950
he's awesome.
That movie was awesome.

2294
01:41:47,951 --> 01:41:49,810
Is that what it's called?
The Moon?

2295
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:51,730
Yeah,
that was great.

2296
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,260
I met him because he was dating,
uh,

2297
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,680
Leslie Bibb.
Yeah,

2298
01:41:56,980 --> 01:42:00,880
they were dating back then when I worked
with her in a movie.

2299
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:01,870
Uh,
I did,

2300
01:42:01,871 --> 01:42:03,010
uh,
Kevin James Movie,

2301
01:42:03,011 --> 01:42:05,820
zookeeper with her.
I was her ex boyfriend who a douche bag.

2302
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:08,530
I saw that fun,
fun movie do.

2303
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,370
She's super cool man.
You want to talk about someone?

2304
01:42:10,371 --> 01:42:13,420
It's funny that girl [inaudible] nights
with her,

2305
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:14,290
they hang out.
Oh,

2306
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,840
that makes sense.
She's super fucking cool.

2307
01:42:16,841 --> 01:42:21,250
Really smart too.
But I'm at Rockwell.

2308
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:24,760
That was the thing that I really got to
me like a dude,

2309
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,630
that movie.

2310
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:27,730
Yeah.
I mean it's fucking amazing.

2311
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:30,700
That movie moon.
It is a movie.

2312
01:42:30,701 --> 01:42:32,920
This is,
this is how unusual this movie is.

2313
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:35,260
There are no other actors.
I know.

2314
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,600
It's amazing.
Sam Rockwell through the whole movie and

2315
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:40,860
it's a march and didn't,
didn't Martian fields emotion feel like

2316
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:42,850
kind of like a diet and then when you
saw it,

2317
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:47,950
well I felt that way even though I
didn't cause it was different because it

2318
01:42:47,951 --> 01:42:51,740
was more about the hazards of
colonization and without the

2319
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:55,420
psychological align with this movie,
I can't give anything away because it's,

2320
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:58,660
this movie is a mind fuck at the end.
It's great.

2321
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:01,210
It's a mind fuck the whole way.
It's a mind fuck.

2322
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:02,651
I said,
Jeez,

2323
01:43:02,651 --> 01:43:05,380
Diet Martian I or I thought the Marsha
was the diet man.

2324
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,050
Maybe I thought it was just another,
well listen man,

2325
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:12,220
this is nothing wrong with like doing a
take on someone colonizing another

2326
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:12,610
planet.

2327
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:14,300
We have to be real careful about that.
No,

2328
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:15,010
no,
no.

2329
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:17,680
Was,
it was a book and everything just for me

2330
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:20,410
in my,
in my eight year old movie going and

2331
01:43:20,411 --> 01:43:22,000
seeing in person,
I was like,

2332
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:22,870
man,
it's,

2333
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:24,370
it's good.
But when like moon,

2334
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:27,380
I know there's a problem with,
uh,

2335
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:29,830
people are scared to do those fucking
space movies,

2336
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,550
do some more goddamn space moves the
plane over here.

2337
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:38,700
I Watch Alien Covenant Again Five Times.
Actually every plane flight I take,

2338
01:43:39,671 --> 01:43:43,050
I already have them downloaded on this
fucking iphone and I watched promethium

2339
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:44,920
and that back and forth.
You should go to jail.

2340
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,110
Alien Covenant on it.
I know,

2341
01:43:47,111 --> 01:43:48,370
but you know what?
I got it.

2342
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:51,630
It's there.
I don't have to add the Internet and I

2343
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,900
have to pay for it.
If it's on thing I'll watch it but like

2344
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:55,010
you ever used an apple TV.

2345
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:56,580
We stream.
We fall into that too.

2346
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:00,530
That's incredible work.
What a lot of work takes two swipes.

2347
01:44:00,531 --> 01:44:01,364
I know,
I know,

2348
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,270
but look,
I feel like that that alien covenant was

2349
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:13,110
such a fucking good good.
They like canceled or something.

2350
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:16,400
I heard that he was had another one
alien awakening which is supposed to

2351
01:44:16,401 --> 01:44:21,401
deal with the time before after per meet
the US and into alien.

2352
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:25,160
Kevin's supposed to be the ship ride or
whatever and I'm like and that they were

2353
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:28,640
going to shut it down and crazy.
I here's what happens when we get to a

2354
01:44:28,641 --> 01:44:31,250
certain level of money.
When you're investing in those kinds of

2355
01:44:31,251 --> 01:44:33,780
films threshold.
There's a threshold and though,

2356
01:44:33,781 --> 01:44:38,781
because there's so expensive to make,
there's so much CGI and so much chaos

2357
01:44:39,561 --> 01:44:44,510
and special effects and an alien
covenant had a great fucking plot too.

2358
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,650
I mean everything was great that it was,
there's so many twists and turns and the

2359
01:44:48,651 --> 01:44:50,000
aliens were terrifying.

2360
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:52,970
They explained them.
I mean there was so much to it.

2361
01:44:52,971 --> 01:44:57,410
It was read a fucking good.
The finger on the pipe prometheus's for

2362
01:44:57,411 --> 01:45:00,950
a lot of people was less than than what
they wanted.

2363
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:02,840
That's how it wasn't.
There was a bad movie.

2364
01:45:02,841 --> 01:45:04,780
I really liked it.
I thought it was fantastic.

2365
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:07,320
They were setting some shit up and it
didn't do that well.

2366
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:09,470
And we are spending,
I don't know how much the fuck they

2367
01:45:09,471 --> 01:45:11,120
spend on those movies,
but they're super,

2368
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:12,500
super expensive.
It's one of them,

2369
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:15,680
I mean aliens to as James Cameron,
like blade runner level shit in my

2370
01:45:15,681 --> 01:45:18,950
opinion in the sense where like at first
it doesn't seem like it's a massive

2371
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:22,590
thing,
but it's just like for life it's that me

2372
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,640
is fantastic.
And the question that it opens and the

2373
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:30,080
second piece where I got to shout out to
blake judd cause he said,

2374
01:45:30,081 --> 01:45:32,060
hey man,
you're going to see it but you're going

2375
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:34,680
to leave and you're going to be mad
because you can have way more questions

2376
01:45:34,681 --> 01:45:35,390
than before.

2377
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:37,250
And then I told the same thing to sturge
Joel.

2378
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:38,770
He was like,
I'm about to go see covenant.

2379
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:39,590
I was like,
dude,

2380
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:42,510
you're going to be mad.
I wasn't mad at all.

2381
01:45:42,511 --> 01:45:43,790
No,
I'm just saying cause I want to see the

2382
01:45:43,791 --> 01:45:45,260
next one.
I want to know more.

2383
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,150
Right.
You still don't know the engineer thing

2384
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:49,570
they see did,
that was just one of their planets like

2385
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:52,850
our planet and they seated and they went
there.

2386
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:55,100
So you're like,
the next one should,

2387
01:45:55,101 --> 01:45:57,110
or,
or at least like the finishing story

2388
01:45:57,111 --> 01:46:00,530
they said they wanted make it world war
of the worlds kind of thing where it was

2389
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:05,060
like all of a sudden these people
descend and it's the two opposing kind

2390
01:46:05,061 --> 01:46:08,360
of parties,
which is the David side and then maybe

2391
01:46:08,361 --> 01:46:13,040
us extending onto the engineer's planet
like finally and it's all of a sudden

2392
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,570
these two opposing forces,
you know,

2393
01:46:14,571 --> 01:46:16,400
so like I think that's brilliant
writing.

2394
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:19,400
It's fucking fantastic.
When you got to realize is that movie

2395
01:46:19,401 --> 01:46:23,660
the original alien?
It goes back to 1979 with sigourney

2396
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:27,310
weaver when she was as hot as the
surface of the sun.

2397
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:31,430
They got the she running shit.
She's the original feminist Superhero

2398
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:35,870
Gorney weaver,
[inaudible] original Badass woman in

2399
01:46:35,871 --> 01:46:37,640
movies,
fucking up monsters.

2400
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:40,430
She's the original.
All these other movies that came

2401
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:42,920
afterwards though the whether they're
fun,

2402
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:45,590
you love em resident evil type shit or
who was that?

2403
01:46:45,591 --> 01:46:49,710
Kate beckinsale chick was a vampire.
I saw those underworld,

2404
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:50,130
all those

2405
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:53,970
super bad ass chicks in movies.
They all,

2406
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,860
oh,
sigourney weaver.

2407
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:57,960
She was believable,
man.

2408
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,040
She's a scientist,
a scientist or whatever the fuck her job

2409
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:05,610
was on that space ship.
And she was the only one who lived that

2410
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:06,510
movie.
Spoiler,

2411
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:11,540
it's 1979 trudeau has seen it.
But in that movie they were worried

2412
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:14,010
about artificial intelligence.
That's amazing.

2413
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,600
Hr,
Giger designed all that.

2414
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:18,090
She had this space chalky it you stop
and think about,

2415
01:47:18,091 --> 01:47:22,650
they were worried about artificial
intelligence back in 1979 and that's

2416
01:47:22,651 --> 01:47:27,150
like when you talk to Elan Musk,
it's like one of his primary concerns.

2417
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,370
No,
he's supposed to do the podcast.

2418
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:33,270
I was in his physical presence at the
UFC,

2419
01:47:33,271 --> 01:47:35,040
but I didn't get a chance to communicate
with them.

2420
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:38,190
He was with his lady,
but we had been going back and forth

2421
01:47:38,191 --> 01:47:39,660
through email,
so it was extra weird.

2422
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,020
Um,
but I,

2423
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:41,790
I'm,
I'm working,

2424
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:43,560
you know,
when I'm doing the commentary,

2425
01:47:43,561 --> 01:47:44,610
man,
I'm trying to be,

2426
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:46,200
I don't want to suck.
People get mad at me.

2427
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:49,350
I tried to do my best.
I've tried to focus.

2428
01:47:49,351 --> 01:47:52,740
I can't go,
yo eat these fights are crazy,

2429
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:56,970
bro.
There's no really real room for that.

2430
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:59,940
But he's worried about artificial
intelligence more than anything.

2431
01:47:59,941 --> 01:48:02,430
And I mean this,
you're talking about a super genius.

2432
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,070
It has an electric car company,
a rocket ship,

2433
01:48:05,071 --> 01:48:07,520
companies drilling holes under the
fucking ground.

2434
01:48:07,521 --> 01:48:09,180
He sells flame throwers.
I mean,

2435
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:12,090
get the fuck out of here.
This is the guy that's worried about

2436
01:48:12,091 --> 01:48:13,980
artificial intelligence.
We should be paying attention.

2437
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,610
And if you go back

2438
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:18,090
too,
by the way,

2439
01:48:18,091 --> 01:48:19,200
there was an article,

2440
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:21,530
well,
I want to say it was the La Times that

2441
01:48:21,531 --> 01:48:26,000
compared elan musk to Donald Trump.
It was like one of the most click baity

2442
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:26,834
articles.

2443
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:28,780
They're fighting for their lives out
there.

2444
01:48:28,781 --> 01:48:30,550
Man.
These fucking journalists,

2445
01:48:30,551 --> 01:48:33,610
they're fighting for their lives,
good for them.

2446
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:36,820
They've got to get those clicks,
got all tangled up in this thing.

2447
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:39,070
Um,
your chain man,

2448
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,113
uh,
I'm,

2449
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:45,250
I love guys who are crazy and ambitious
and make shit like Elan Musk,

2450
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:47,950
whatever is happening with them.
The fact that he's like,

2451
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:48,731
oh,
whatever,

2452
01:48:48,731 --> 01:48:50,320
I'll figure it out.
Let her just let it go.

2453
01:48:50,321 --> 01:48:52,240
Get it yourself out.
That's what's amazing.

2454
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:54,280
As soon as you let it go,
that's how high you are.

2455
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:58,770
And you thought you were tangled,
you ain't tangle like an example free

2456
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:00,700
bro.
You got to break free and these change.

2457
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:02,170
Um,
no,

2458
01:49:02,171 --> 01:49:03,700
I just like guys,
you know what,

2459
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:06,970
I'll talk about spiritual for a minute.
I have to shout out to my,

2460
01:49:06,971 --> 01:49:07,804
uh,
uh,

2461
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:08,591
the,
the,

2462
01:49:08,591 --> 01:49:10,510
uh,
block tronics crew.

2463
01:49:10,511 --> 01:49:11,980
My,
my antsy artists,

2464
01:49:11,981 --> 01:49:15,970
I was talking about computers and bbs is
in block tronics or a antsy artists

2465
01:49:15,971 --> 01:49:16,180
group.

2466
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:17,600
They're great.
That sturgeon,

2467
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:23,610
it's so cool to watch him come up and
he's like,

2468
01:49:23,801 --> 01:49:27,760
got this kind of angle it like,
it's makes me,

2469
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:31,420
I just love watching him on your show
and I just have to say us hanging out

2470
01:49:31,421 --> 01:49:35,890
and everything all these years later,
he just has a sense where I feel like,

2471
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:38,350
wow,
there's a rocket ship in this universe

2472
01:49:38,351 --> 01:49:42,340
and we kind of speak the same language
and it's like a cool vibe.

2473
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:46,330
Um,
kind of having another dude out there

2474
01:49:46,331 --> 01:49:48,700
who,
who has the same sensibilities and like

2475
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:51,880
when we hang out,
you and me and him and everything,

2476
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:54,340
I feel like it's,

2477
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,400
you know what I mean?
Like,

2478
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:57,590
I know what you mean about a mother
fucker.

2479
01:49:57,650 --> 01:49:58,380
Yeah,
no,

2480
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,390
I'm honored to be his friend too.
Yeah.

2481
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:02,180
Yeah.
I'm honored to be your friend too,

2482
01:50:02,181 --> 01:50:03,790
man.
For Real.

2483
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,750
I'm honored to be your friend and you
took me.

2484
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:08,780
I came to go see you play and you took
us in and then Dave Chappelle played

2485
01:50:08,781 --> 01:50:09,410
right after.
You're like,

2486
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:10,071
Oh yeah,
hey,

2487
01:50:10,071 --> 01:50:10,791
uh,
my friend,

2488
01:50:10,791 --> 01:50:15,200
Dave's going to do a thing and then you
killed it and then he killed it and that

2489
01:50:15,201 --> 01:50:16,034
was crazy,
man.

2490
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:19,040
That was awesome.
We're all lucky to know each other like

2491
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:21,530
it's fun.
It's fun to know cool people,

2492
01:50:21,770 --> 01:50:23,900
but a sturgeon has got some new shit
coming out,

2493
01:50:23,901 --> 01:50:25,360
man.
She shared some stuff with me,

2494
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:29,360
sent me some,
some images and explain what he's doing.

2495
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:31,520
I can't wait to hear it.
It sounds fantastic.

2496
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:35,270
It's going to be a why he sent me
[inaudible] can't see you can't say

2497
01:50:35,271 --> 01:50:36,020
nothing about it.

2498
01:50:36,020 --> 01:50:41,020
I'm on fucking here.
I accidentally leaked the title of his

2499
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:46,240
last album I accidentally gave.
He sent it to me in advance and I put it

2500
01:50:46,461 --> 01:50:49,070
up on instagram and I said this new
sturgill Simpson Shit.

2501
01:50:49,071 --> 01:50:51,510
It's off the charts.
Yes I did.

2502
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:53,510
I didn't know.
And then he's like,

2503
01:50:53,511 --> 01:50:54,560
dude,
you fucked up.

2504
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:57,800
Oh No.
And he was laughing.

2505
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:58,880
He thought it was fine.
It looks like it.

2506
01:50:58,881 --> 01:51:01,280
Just let people know about some of the
awesome early,

2507
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:04,700
but I was listening to it in the gym and
a while I was listening to us in the

2508
01:51:04,701 --> 01:51:07,190
middle of sets and I was like,
God damn,

2509
01:51:07,191 --> 01:51:08,260
this is good.
And then I just,

2510
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:11,300
I got to instagram this shit and like
instagram that I didn't know.

2511
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,190
Hey,
that's cool dude.

2512
01:51:13,191 --> 01:51:14,660
You did the same thing with my old
records.

2513
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:15,493
You're like,
you put a,

2514
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:18,650
you put a picture of it up of your,
you just like screen grabs.

2515
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:19,640
Yeah,
no,

2516
01:51:19,641 --> 01:51:20,690
I like to do that,
man.

2517
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:21,920
I was listening.
She ate it.

2518
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:22,701
Oh,
hey man,

2519
01:51:22,701 --> 01:51:24,290
I appreciate your music for real.
Thanks.

2520
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,060
I was,
uh,

2521
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:28,160
in um,
Italy and I was about to workout.

2522
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:29,360
And then you know how you just,
you know,

2523
01:51:29,361 --> 01:51:31,310
you have those I phones without that
little,

2524
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:33,080
um,
the cord with a button.

2525
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:33,943
You could press the button.
Oh,

2526
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:35,840
you start playing whatever you got on
your iphone.

2527
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:38,300
It just goes right to Kool moe dee.
I go,

2528
01:51:38,301 --> 01:51:42,220
we'll work.
You know that song I go to work but at

2529
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:45,410
band I'm going to work like a boxer.
You know?

2530
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:46,700
It's like,
it's a great,

2531
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:51,050
like I go to work song some about to
work out and this fucking song comes on

2532
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:53,060
almost like the universe is letting you
know,

2533
01:51:53,061 --> 01:51:55,040
look dude,
just,

2534
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:57,530
just don't try to think this through too
much.

2535
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:01,700
Just press that button.
The songs there,

2536
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:03,610
I don't know why it's there.
You don't know why it's dairy that

2537
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,810
stopped thinking about it.
Right.

2538
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:07,310
But it's there right when you needed it,
that songs there.

2539
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:11,690
But at bat I go to work and then you go
to work it like it's weird.

2540
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:12,830
This is it.
This is theater.

2541
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:15,330
This whole thing is theater in some sort
of strange whatever cat.

2542
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:17,030
Yeah,
there's some,

2543
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:19,970
there's some part of life that's
seriously theater,

2544
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:21,710
right man.
I mean it,

2545
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:22,663
it,
it,

2546
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:27,120
to me the older I get,
I just feel like the more appreciative

2547
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:30,540
for,
for like my dumb herself for having

2548
01:52:30,541 --> 01:52:32,880
gotten through it without more damage
being done.

2549
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:35,670
So at this point I'm,
you know,

2550
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:41,180
like I just really appreciate everybody
who puts an effort into the city into

2551
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:42,540
life.
You know what I mean?

2552
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:44,940
So you're like,
you feel like somebody is doing good.

2553
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,190
It's like you,

2554
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:47,630
you just,
I don't know.

2555
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:51,890
It's like you and this show and how like
you've had this awesome career and then

2556
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:55,400
I only met you the first time when I
came on this show and I like smoked pot

2557
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:57,530
in the parking lot and I was like kind
of out of it.

2558
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:58,641
And I was like,
oh.

2559
01:52:58,641 --> 01:53:00,230
And I came here and didn't bring a
record.

2560
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:03,220
That's why this time I was like,
I had to make sure we had a record by

2561
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:04,190
record.
It's called shooter.

2562
01:53:04,191 --> 01:53:05,690
It's out now.
I have to say something.

2563
01:53:05,691 --> 01:53:08,540
I didn't talk about it all,
but John Hensley,

2564
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:09,920
Mary,
my manager back then,

2565
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:13,160
he called me and said,
you didn't even talk about the record

2566
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:14,060
once.
And I was like,

2567
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:15,140
shit,
I don't know man.

2568
01:53:15,141 --> 01:53:16,560
We just got talking.
And it was,

2569
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:18,140
I mean,
that's how it is with you,

2570
01:53:18,141 --> 01:53:19,850
you know?
But I love doing that with you because

2571
01:53:19,851 --> 01:53:21,890
it's like I'll go down the rabbit hole,
man,

2572
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:26,540
I'll be on the algae at all and I think
people are scared to do that.

2573
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,060
I think don't use anything wrong with
having thoughts.

2574
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,310
I said we've got to stop yelling at
people.

2575
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:34,380
Gotta stop yelling.
I think this,

2576
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:36,440
there's the anger that we expressed
towards each other.

2577
01:53:36,441 --> 01:53:40,760
Forces anger and return when it's not
always necessary.

2578
01:53:40,761 --> 01:53:43,520
Sometimes it's necessary.
Sometimes you see Nazis in

2579
01:53:43,521 --> 01:53:46,090
Charlottesville and you've got to go,
hey you dumb fucks.

2580
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:49,340
Like are you out of your fucking mind?
You really want to categorize people by

2581
01:53:49,341 --> 01:53:52,670
race.
This is 2018 you've got to stop.

2582
01:53:52,671 --> 01:53:56,360
This is some stupid shit.
I think the positive look at all of that

2583
01:53:56,361 --> 01:53:59,900
is the numbers of those kinds of insane
people have dwindled to a point cause I

2584
01:53:59,901 --> 01:54:03,650
remember when I was a kid and there
would be like still clan people and

2585
01:54:03,651 --> 01:54:05,990
stuff and that's just the argument for
free speech.

2586
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:09,970
The argument for free speeches.
Ultimately it'll figure it out and

2587
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:11,030
analysis out.

2588
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:12,440
Yeah,
it does.

2589
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:16,970
I think it does and it doesn't totally
because let's just be completely honest.

2590
01:54:16,971 --> 01:54:20,600
Some people do a terrible job raising
children and these children go out into

2591
01:54:20,601 --> 01:54:23,060
the world and they're just causing
damage everywhere they go.

2592
01:54:23,061 --> 01:54:27,650
They're on fire and they just run it
through dry bushes their entire life,

2593
01:54:27,651 --> 01:54:30,620
right?
They're creating chaos and it's from the

2594
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:34,170
what set them off when they were young,
how they evolve.

2595
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:39,390
They expect everyone to have like the,
the same starting point and be judged on

2596
01:54:40,701 --> 01:54:42,590
your emotional behavior,
your,

2597
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,810
your impulsiveness,
your,

2598
01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:45,644
your,
your,

2599
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:49,160
you know,
dishonesty or your discipline to be

2600
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:53,060
judged on those as if you all started
from the same spot on the board is just

2601
01:54:53,061 --> 01:54:54,530
crazy,
right?

2602
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:57,050
It's just crazy.
And this is part of what we do.

2603
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:01,670
We judge based on results only and when
we see someone to fucked up,

2604
01:55:01,671 --> 01:55:02,361
we don't go,
okay,

2605
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:05,330
what happened to this person that made
them so fucking crazy,

2606
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:05,750
right?

2607
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:09,380
Like is it really their fault or Zeros?
A series of events that lead to you

2608
01:55:09,381 --> 01:55:11,960
being who you are right now.
And maybe we should remap it.

2609
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:14,990
Maybe we should remap it and just look
at it in a different way and say,

2610
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:15,840
look,
look,

2611
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:18,710
we definitely don't want that result
again ever.

2612
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:21,260
Right.
We've got to figure out why you got to

2613
01:55:21,261 --> 01:55:23,660
that result.
What made you break into the bank and

2614
01:55:23,661 --> 01:55:25,190
put a gun in someone's face?
I mean,

2615
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:26,510
how did you get there?
That's true.

2616
01:55:26,511 --> 01:55:28,570
It's like Manson said in the bowling for
Columbine.

2617
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:29,391
He said,
they said,

2618
01:55:29,391 --> 01:55:31,670
well would you say to the columbine
killers?

2619
01:55:31,671 --> 01:55:32,670
And he said,
I would ask,

2620
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:36,620
I would ask them their opinion cause it
seems like nobody asked them their

2621
01:55:36,621 --> 01:55:38,120
opinion.
You know what I mean?

2622
01:55:38,121 --> 01:55:40,370
So like yeah,
I asked him what the fuck happened.

2623
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,780
Yeah.
Are they both dead?

2624
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:42,680
They're both dead,
right?

2625
01:55:42,681 --> 01:55:43,511
Yeah.
Can,

2626
01:55:43,511 --> 01:55:45,660
it's tough to ask them their opinion.
I mean it's like,

2627
01:55:45,661 --> 01:55:46,610
you know,
make a love song,

2628
01:55:47,030 --> 01:55:49,790
but you know,
the reality is someone who,

2629
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:53,700
who broke like what made you break.
We've all broken in little ways in our

2630
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:57,750
lives and sure all lived through it and
we all appreciate other people who have

2631
01:55:57,751 --> 01:56:00,210
done the same thing.
And when you get to a point when you get

2632
01:56:00,211 --> 01:56:05,040
old enough where you realize you can
watch when someone is having a moment

2633
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:07,890
that they can't make it through,
that you've kind of been through in ways

2634
01:56:07,891 --> 01:56:09,720
you kind of find it,
you know?

2635
01:56:09,721 --> 01:56:13,440
Those are the kinds of people that I
like that that will go and talk to that

2636
01:56:13,441 --> 01:56:16,380
person because they can see that and I
think that you're absolutely one of

2637
01:56:16,381 --> 01:56:19,080
those kinds of people because I've
actually had conversations with you when

2638
01:56:19,081 --> 01:56:22,680
we were backstage at the fucking comedy
store or wherever we were wounded that

2639
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,040
night happened.

2640
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:25,080
We had a conversation,
I don't quite remember the whole thing,

2641
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:28,050
but it was about music and about
listening to music and it's like you're

2642
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:31,690
a compassionate dude and people who
that's,

2643
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:35,850
that's all it's about compassion.
It's about compassion and stability.

2644
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:39,720
It's about recognizing the best times
come when we're nice to each other.

2645
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:43,230
If you go to a bar and there's a bunch
of strange dudes you never met in your

2646
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:47,340
life and an hour later you guys are high
five and then laughing and hugging each

2647
01:56:47,341 --> 01:56:50,760
other and you're buying rounds,
that's a great time.

2648
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,850
Or you can go to a bar and someone wants
to get a dick wave and competition.

2649
01:56:53,851 --> 01:56:55,740
Next thing you know you got hit in the
back of the head by a chair.

2650
01:56:55,741 --> 01:56:57,090
That's possible too,
right?

2651
01:56:57,390 --> 01:57:00,030
You know both things are possible.
You know when one feels way better.

2652
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:02,160
The one that feels way better is the one
where you meet,

2653
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:05,790
meet a bunch of new friends and then
these guys you never met before and now

2654
01:57:05,791 --> 01:57:09,690
your buddies and then you realize like I
just ran into a fucking bunch of awesome

2655
01:57:09,691 --> 01:57:12,240
dudes who are now some of my favorite
people ever.

2656
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:14,630
And if I didn't go out that night,
who knows what would've happened?

2657
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:18,300
Just randomly ran into a group of
amazing people and change the course of

2658
01:57:18,301 --> 01:57:20,430
your whole life.
That's possible too,

2659
01:57:20,431 --> 01:57:22,590
man.
But we got to be that friend at the bar.

2660
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:25,050
We got to be that new friend.
At the bar and the more people it's

2661
01:57:25,051 --> 01:57:26,340
possible to do that,
man.

2662
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:30,060
And I think a lot of it is just the way
we think of each other.

2663
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:32,910
There's a,
there's a problem in our operating

2664
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:37,440
system or we have a ultra competitive
operating system and things we shouldn't

2665
01:57:37,441 --> 01:57:39,480
be competitive in.
There should be.

2666
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:43,500
Then I think part of the reason is we've
lost a lot of competitiveness in life.

2667
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:47,550
I think people were competitive in life
in ways where there's fighting for their

2668
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:48,660
survival,
right?

2669
01:57:48,661 --> 01:57:51,870
They're fighting neighboring tribes the
most brutal and primitive of days.

2670
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:52,800
Azure media.
Yeah.

2671
01:57:52,801 --> 01:57:55,530
And then as things changed and move
forward,

2672
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:59,580
that got less and less physical and more
and more mental in the body got

2673
01:57:59,581 --> 01:58:02,700
frustrated and I think this is part of
what's happening along the way.

2674
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:05,460
And then people started looking for
competition in business.

2675
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:07,410
You ever hear like Weirdo business guys
talk,

2676
01:58:07,411 --> 01:58:09,590
we're going to fucking stuffed our
contract right up there.

2677
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:13,150
They get all crazy.
Like they're starting a war man.

2678
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:16,980
You know,
like super hyper hyped up business guys.

2679
01:58:16,981 --> 01:58:19,650
Got My competition has always been
disparaging me,

2680
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:21,810
which you know,
all those jerks about my past,

2681
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:25,380
you know,
they get fucking so that they want to

2682
01:58:25,381 --> 01:58:28,270
kill the competition.
Those people are weird bed.

2683
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:30,930
They're weird.
They're focusing on it the wrong way.

2684
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:33,600
There's some some dinosaur shit.
Yeah,

2685
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:34,420
yeah.
That's,

2686
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:37,230
well that's the money thing.
That's like if you're in the money game,

2687
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:39,180
yeah.
But you don't have to do that to be in

2688
01:58:39,181 --> 01:58:40,380
the,
even in the money game,

2689
01:58:40,381 --> 01:58:41,920
you don't have to do that anymore.
Like I,

2690
01:58:41,950 --> 01:58:42,740
yeah,

2691
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:43,600
you're right.
But I mean,

2692
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:45,790
but if you do,
you know what I mean?

2693
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:48,670
Like you do something you love,
you pursue angles.

2694
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:53,200
Like you chose to pursue lots like
similar to me where it's similar in this

2695
01:58:53,201 --> 01:58:55,630
way.
Like you've chose to pursue all these

2696
01:58:55,631 --> 01:58:59,290
little different angles of the universe
that are in the entertainment business,

2697
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:02,950
but they are also like things you love
like the UFC and then,

2698
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:05,380
and then you know all the different
little,

2699
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:08,860
I mean you've,
you've had so many different little

2700
01:59:08,861 --> 01:59:13,060
angles that you've occupied land up here
where you get to just talk about all

2701
01:59:13,061 --> 01:59:15,340
this shit that you love.
It doesn't make sense.

2702
01:59:15,341 --> 01:59:17,200
Even to me,
I wake up in the morning,

2703
01:59:17,201 --> 01:59:19,990
like today I wake up,
I go and work out and I'm sitting there

2704
01:59:19,991 --> 01:59:20,950
going,
what am I doing?

2705
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:24,340
I'm just looking at this place shopping.
What's fucking awesome?

2706
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:24,850
It's crazy.

2707
01:59:24,850 --> 01:59:28,330
Like honestly,
I wake up in the morning like,

2708
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:30,580
how'd this happen?
You have an archery thing.

2709
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:33,820
I would have old computers and that wall
and I would have like a pinball machine

2710
01:59:33,821 --> 01:59:36,430
and a bunch of old arcade games.
I have my own taste,

2711
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,440
but like you got,
honestly,

2712
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:39,370
it's,
it's a,

2713
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:42,860
it,
you have found your path and,

2714
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:46,160
and it's awesome and you're
compassionate and you're here and you,

2715
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:48,190
you weren't in it.
If you were in it for the money,

2716
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:52,120
you'd be somewhere else.
You're in it for what you like to,

2717
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:54,370
didn't even know what I'm doing.
I don't know why minute you're talking

2718
01:59:54,371 --> 01:59:58,260
for me right now.
[inaudible]

2719
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:01,150
second warning,
you're going to be a great dad and then

2720
02:00:01,151 --> 02:00:03,970
you're going to go do what you love to
do and come home and,

2721
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,910
and that's awesome.
I just do what the great magnet compels

2722
02:00:06,911 --> 02:00:07,800
me to do.
I'm,

2723
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:11,920
I'm merely metal filings moving through
the universe and credit towards the

2724
02:00:11,921 --> 02:00:16,060
great mascot metaphysical Neri,
Magna last 10 sure I made,

2725
02:00:16,061 --> 02:00:17,740
I've decided,
one of the things I've been thinking

2726
02:00:17,741 --> 02:00:19,430
about recently,
especially over the last,

2727
02:00:19,431 --> 02:00:23,170
like maybe 10 years of my life,
I've decided way less things that I did

2728
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:27,880
in the [inaudible] what I need to seems
to me things just sort of happen.

2729
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:28,721
So,
you know,

2730
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:32,200
first the Bob Seger thing,
I moves,

2731
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:37,150
I just tried to make some fun travel.
Yeah.

2732
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:40,120
My,
my kids excel past me are ready all the

2733
02:00:40,121 --> 02:00:43,480
time cause yesterday,
I mean they trick me and they do things

2734
02:00:43,481 --> 02:00:45,330
and they're smarter and there and you
know,

2735
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:49,720
nothing I could do could impress them
more than what they can do by watching

2736
02:00:49,721 --> 02:00:50,980
what I can do and doing it better.

2737
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:51,880
Well,
how about when they do,

2738
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:53,920
they fucking grab electronics.
They figured out.

2739
02:00:53,921 --> 02:00:55,270
That gave me that you don't know how to
do it.

2740
02:00:55,271 --> 02:00:57,280
She got to go into settings and you go
to here and you're like,

2741
02:00:57,281 --> 02:00:58,114
what?
You're eight.

2742
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:00,910
Can you do this?
My daughter programs,

2743
02:01:00,911 --> 02:01:05,911
the log off in minecraft you can program
these blocks blocked.

2744
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:08,330
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2745
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:12,250
I have to shout my RC people.
Oh yeah.

2746
02:01:12,251 --> 02:01:13,490
Our,
you still use IRC?

2747
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,333
Yeah,
I'm still,

2748
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:20,230
do you have a ham radio in your backyard
is a BCR my record label that I owned

2749
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:21,570
with Adam,
uh,

2750
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:24,050
there's a BCR IRC.
What does that,

2751
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:28,810
the dcrs black country rockets,
the label that put out this records on

2752
02:01:28,811 --> 02:01:31,000
Electra through lcs and,
and uh,

2753
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:32,710
Dave Cobb,
his label.

2754
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:33,603
Yup.
There we go.

2755
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:36,250
Uh,
I keep looking at the cameras that are

2756
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:39,160
not this place.
It's too freaky.

2757
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:41,480
Used to have the cameras on while we
were on but it's too weird.

2758
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,410
Hard to be yourself.
Um,

2759
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,360
I think they were on actually last time
cause that was too weird too.

2760
02:01:47,361 --> 02:01:49,370
Freaky freaked everybody out.
Especially when we'd started getting

2761
02:01:49,371 --> 02:01:50,330
high.
And you're like what?

2762
02:01:50,331 --> 02:01:53,000
This is not right,
but we have a thing called a know the

2763
02:01:53,001 --> 02:01:58,001
BCR bizarre DOTCOM BCR be a z a r.com
and it's like a place where like fans

2764
02:01:58,401 --> 02:02:00,560
come and they talk and we have an IRC
server.

2765
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:03,150
So there was one all day and I'm on it
all day and I talked to Pete.

2766
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:05,300
So ridiculous.
You just gave people that out.

2767
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:08,790
Now people are going to go there.
I hope I welcome please.

2768
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:11,390
I used to do a CRC back with my quake
days.

2769
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,710
Oh yeah.
Great way to communicate.

2770
02:02:13,711 --> 02:02:16,840
Like teams would communicate with you
like server addresses are all going to

2771
02:02:16,841 --> 02:02:19,250
meet up at that show is free as fuck.
The inner,

2772
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:22,460
the government didn't even know how to
fucking trace a phone.

2773
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:25,190
Literally like listen in on IRC back
then.

2774
02:02:25,191 --> 02:02:26,960
Like they had to pick up from the
hackers.

2775
02:02:26,961 --> 02:02:29,030
Like how to do it.
That was a very,

2776
02:02:29,031 --> 02:02:33,380
very different thing when those,
all those message boards and all those

2777
02:02:33,381 --> 02:02:37,490
things came up like uh,
especially like the ability to,

2778
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:40,910
we play games and talk to people in real
time during the games.

2779
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:44,870
[inaudible] I'm one of the ways I've
learned how to type was from learning

2780
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:49,580
how to type in game play quick cause you
got a tight quick quake one or like

2781
02:02:49,581 --> 02:02:51,800
quick what was known and what was it?
Started with quake two,

2782
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:58,640
quake to multiplayer could wake one.
I mean I was in doom so like when quake

2783
02:02:58,641 --> 02:03:02,990
one came out and I was nine inch nails,
my favorite band ever and Lynn went back

2784
02:03:02,991 --> 02:03:07,310
then and still was the influence for me.
Like he did the soundtrack.

2785
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,910
I think I was a moldy shit.

2786
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:11,810
Amazing.
It's funny that all these years later

2787
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:14,390
she's like,
I didn't have a computer but I went and

2788
02:03:14,391 --> 02:03:17,060
bought that sand because Trent reznor
did it cause she was into nine inch

2789
02:03:17,061 --> 02:03:18,530
nails and I'm like,
it's so hot.

2790
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:21,590
Oh she has the CD of it in our house
still.

2791
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:23,240
But anyway,
man,

2792
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:26,330
I loved that and I used to do that too.
And once the Internet came on,

2793
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:30,140
I had a friend in Nashville,
me and my buddy James and Greg,

2794
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:33,110
greg,
this guy ran a bbs and he bought a doom

2795
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:37,580
to server back then where you had had
four phone lines and modems in it and

2796
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:41,360
dial in 56 k days.
Totally.

2797
02:03:41,361 --> 02:03:44,600
And we would play doom two and listen,
I was listening to like um,

2798
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:48,250
White Zombie Astra creep 2000 as
probably 14,

2799
02:03:48,270 --> 02:03:52,370
13 just jam and this shit out man.
I was such a nerd.

2800
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:53,930
Still am man.
If you saw my house,

2801
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:54,950
you got to come over some time.

2802
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:59,780
But I've got like my office is like 1993
we watched laser disks,

2803
02:03:59,781 --> 02:04:04,370
we have like old computers and like old
shit everywhere.

2804
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,690
So it's like I kind of,
it's kind of frozen in a a weird

2805
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:12,020
technological phase that I love.
That's hilarious.

2806
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:13,520
That's awesome man.
Yeah,

2807
02:04:13,521 --> 02:04:17,420
you've always been like really into like
weird Internet type shit.

2808
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:22,250
Like he really ended the
cryptocurrencies and there's a thing

2809
02:04:22,251 --> 02:04:23,330
called peep,
peep,

2810
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:27,260
peep eth.
It's on twitter or whatever.

2811
02:04:27,261 --> 02:04:29,120
But it's,
it's a twitter alternative.

2812
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:30,640
It's like,
it's,

2813
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:32,900
it's just,
just starting that.

2814
02:04:32,901 --> 02:04:37,901
It's interesting.
Peop e t h e t h.com is the thing.

2815
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:40,680
It's,
it's like kind of like twitter,

2816
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:42,930
but it's built on the back of the theory
them.

2817
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:46,350
And so every tweet or I'm going to have
a calling them tweets,

2818
02:04:46,351 --> 02:04:48,960
I should call it.
What are every message that you send on

2819
02:04:48,961 --> 02:04:52,380
it?
Kind of like twitter is embedded in the

2820
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:54,780
blockchain of etherium.

2821
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:56,340
Well,
this is to explain what this site says.

2822
02:04:56,341 --> 02:04:58,350
It says the values platform.
Hold on.

2823
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:00,780
What did you do?
So we just uh,

2824
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:06,060
a blockchain powered social network for
our best selves.

2825
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:09,120
Yeah.
Well it because you can't delete

2826
02:05:09,121 --> 02:05:11,940
anything because it's permanently
embedded in,

2827
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:15,420
it's like,
I think up to 10 of your messages can be

2828
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:17,790
logged in one block of the theory and
chain.

2829
02:05:17,791 --> 02:05:22,791
So you have to pay like a cent of it,
but they give you some to begin with.

2830
02:05:23,341 --> 02:05:27,030
And then when somebody messages you,
it's kind of a metric microtransaction

2831
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,070
to you.
So you have this kind of balance.

2832
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:31,260
It's going all the time.
So do you have to open up an account?

2833
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:35,610
You get a sense you can do it without
any involvement.

2834
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:40,650
But the way it works is because it's in
transactions on a blockchain and

2835
02:05:40,651 --> 02:05:41,970
ethereum,
it's,

2836
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,530
it's permanently lodged in this
permanent digital ledger in which that

2837
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:49,140
these transactions are what's making it
happen.

2838
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:51,720
So like if you'd,
you log in and verify yourself,

2839
02:05:51,721 --> 02:05:55,650
they give you like 30 cents because that
starts you out to be able to just kind

2840
02:05:55,651 --> 02:05:58,110
of permanently do this end.
So you don't have to do any,

2841
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:02,460
it sounds complicated but it's cool.
I'm not saying I don't,

2842
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:04,770
I don't know if it will become like the
next rage,

2843
02:06:04,771 --> 02:06:07,300
but it's technologically,
it's a really fucking fun.

2844
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:12,060
Might be launching it right now.
Go back to that page again and expand on

2845
02:06:12,061 --> 02:06:15,270
the right hand side where it shows you
all the different categories and the

2846
02:06:15,271 --> 02:06:20,100
different values,
but make that a larger social media

2847
02:06:20,130 --> 02:06:25,130
bringing out our best with opinionated
features and immune immutability.

2848
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,520
Hmm.
Yeah.

2849
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:30,330
How often do you hear that word?
It's permit.

2850
02:06:30,331 --> 02:06:35,220
I mean not the ability to not mute.
I believe immutability.

2851
02:06:35,221 --> 02:06:36,480
So you can't mute people.
Okay.

2852
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:38,910
Co we'll need to google that in a
moment.

2853
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:43,530
Contact is openly and forever accessible
on the ethereum,

2854
02:06:43,531 --> 02:06:46,680
blockchain and ipfs,
whatever that is.

2855
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:49,950
Thoughtful.
It says permanence and creative

2856
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:51,900
constraints.
Encourage,

2857
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:54,450
mindful and self aware.
Peeps.

2858
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:59,220
They'll kid that was like a Haiku.
What does it that's like a fucking poem

2859
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:01,320
and let some of this fucking thing
under.

2860
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,460
Listen to this.
Again.

2861
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:07,470
Permanence and creative constraints.
Encourage mindful and self aware.

2862
02:07:07,471 --> 02:07:09,720
Peeps.
That's okay.

2863
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:11,970
Is I just stumbled across it,
but I love it.

2864
02:07:11,971 --> 02:07:14,130
I love the technology.
I do too.

2865
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:16,110
But I mean that was,
I don't understand what they just said.

2866
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:18,240
Uh,
charity be responsible.

2867
02:07:18,241 --> 02:07:21,150
Charity badges prevent suffering and
inspire others.

2868
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:25,110
1000,
178 mosquito nets purchase so far.

2869
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:28,320
Oh that's amazing.
So they're making their purchasing

2870
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:31,960
mosquito nets.
Now that that has to do with the,

2871
02:07:31,961 --> 02:07:33,150
uh,
the actual platform.

2872
02:07:33,151 --> 02:07:35,290
I think it's not a real mosquito net.
Don't think,

2873
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:36,010
Oh,
I

2874
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,890
thought responsible matt to this
website.

2875
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,760
I have no,
they tried to do her thing.

2876
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:40,910
Okay,
well they are there.

2877
02:07:40,911 --> 02:07:44,050
They're buying mosquito batches to
prevent malaria.

2878
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:46,900
I'm getting paged cause they ain't go to
Conan.

2879
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:48,190
Oh,
it's over.

2880
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,690
I know.
I don't want it to mark.

2881
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:51,710
I don't want it to be over either
shooter.

2882
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:52,780
We've gotta do this again.
Yeah.

2883
02:07:52,781 --> 02:07:54,810
I led them on man,
and uh,

2884
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,160
I'm,
yeah,

2885
02:07:56,180 --> 02:08:00,610
I'm glad you started off that
controversial subject of the Alex Jones

2886
02:08:00,611 --> 02:08:02,740
thing.
And I'm really glad that Bill Maher went

2887
02:08:02,741 --> 02:08:04,630
out on a ledge and said,
you know,

2888
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:07,600
even if you don't agree with someone,
you're not supposed to silence or

2889
02:08:07,601 --> 02:08:08,980
speech.
You know,

2890
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:12,580
I just don't think people were supposed
to be alone yelling into the wilderness.

2891
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:15,090
I agree.
This farther mentality,

2892
02:08:15,091 --> 02:08:16,330
you know,
is a problem.

2893
02:08:16,370 --> 02:08:18,190
Even him,
I don't think you're supposed to be able

2894
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:19,810
to do that.
I don't think he's supposed to be alone

2895
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:24,400
yelling off into the abyss.
My wife's calling me now because he's

2896
02:08:24,401 --> 02:08:26,020
telling his club.
Everyone's freaking out.

2897
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:29,230
Everyone's freaking the fuck out.
It's just time,

2898
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:31,690
ladies and gentlemen.
It's a way of measuring distance.

2899
02:08:32,190 --> 02:08:34,090
Thank you for having me to jennings your
shit.

2900
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:35,170
I love you too,
brother.

2901
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,730
A shooter.
It's out now.

2902
02:08:36,750 --> 02:08:38,280
She are Janie's outcome this,
uh,

2903
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:40,660
this shit's vinyl,
old school son.

2904
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,430
Respect all.
