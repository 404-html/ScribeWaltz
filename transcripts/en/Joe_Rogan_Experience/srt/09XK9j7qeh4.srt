1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,470
My Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,510
but very good guy too.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,690
Very good fighter in him and Vinnie were
both in the UFC so they got a lot of

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,583
good

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,430
press it up and then they also got uh,

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:14,840
uh,

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,960
my boy jake shields.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,350
That's a good fine.

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,190
That is the same night as the UFC fight
in I think as the same night as UFC

10
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,440
fight in New York City
fucked up world series.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:25,920
That's a,

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,930
that's a tough draw for them to.

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,170
Everyone fucked up.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,780
Yo.

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,080
Let's,

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,120
let's get busy with this.

17
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,980
What do you think about this Brendan Shop?

18
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:36,390
I am very excited about this fight.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,420
I think people are fucking
sleeping on Eddie Alvarez.

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,450
I think he's a dangerous dangerous 155
pounder that motherfucker can punch.

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,020
He punches hard,

22
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:49,860
he's fast as fuck and it does not a human
alive that's more gained in that kit.

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,880
I agree 100 percent.

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,830
If you've never seen him fight before,

25
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,220
you got to watch his fights in bellator
with Michael Chandler and dream.

26
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,121
That's just fights him.

27
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:01,260
Dream to Michael Chandler is another
dude who's out there who is world class.

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,990
That could easily be fighting
and winning in the UFC.

29
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,500
Oh yeah,

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,470
and you see it now with Eddie Alvarez
because it took a while for Eddie to get

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,060
comfortable in the UFC.

32
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,930
He Donald worked him over and his
first fight because dismantled by John,

33
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,120
but now he's training with your book
mchenry and Connor's a goddamn phenom and

34
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,060
he's a.

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,500
he's got as for us a hobby likes to
call it the touch of death in his hands.

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,600
That's a scary fight,

37
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:26,790
man.

38
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,800
Anyone who thinks it's
an easy flight or not,

39
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:31,920
a big fight for conor is they just don't
know the sport out of their time on the

40
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:32,850
underground king,

41
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,930
I think at 55 and everyone knows I'm the
biggest con or nut writer in the world

42
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,160
at 55.

43
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,080
I just don't see a ton of success there.

44
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,460
I think Eddie Alvarez,

45
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:42,630
if you look at the top five,

46
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,421
we've talked about this for you,

47
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,254
like the top five.

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,990
It's his easiest matchup and that's a
fucking nightmare for them because it can

49
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,160
grapple his ass off.

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,930
He's been so many big fights.

51
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,220
It doesn't get tired.

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,050
He doesn't mind winning by decision.

53
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,660
He doesn't get tired and
he's a bigger grandpa.

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:57,871
Yeah.

55
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,350
Those are two and he can't fucking
crack and look at his resume.

56
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,920
Resume.

57
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,600
Chris.

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,470
He's crisp,

59
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:05,220
striking.

60
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,780
He's not an easy guy to hit.

61
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,530
You know you can hit him and
he gets rocked and he survives.

62
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,120
If you watch his chandler fights,

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,680
Eddie Alvarez got rocked and survived
against Chandler and a couple other guys

64
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,330
over in Bella.

65
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:17,441
Well,

66
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:18,150
think about how.

67
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,110
How's Connor win this fight?

68
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:20,070
You go through a hassle.

69
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:20,700
Knock him out.

70
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,740
He has five rounds of document.

71
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,130
You're not winning decision against that.

72
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
He could win a decision.

73
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,930
I don't think so.

74
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,441
I disagree.

75
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,810
Why do you worry about the
fight with Gilbert Melendez?

76
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,950
Eddie wanted decision.

77
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,731
The Gilbert Melendez,

78
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:30,090
fine.

79
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,421
Oh No,

80
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,760
I'm saying Edwin's by decision,

81
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,770
but we don't think that connor
could beat him in a similar fight.

82
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,430
No,

83
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,820
no.

84
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,560
You don't have the endurance.

85
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,100
The takedowns.

86
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,810
The grappling with the striking.

87
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,740
As the rounds go on,

88
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:41,850
the knockout power goes down.

89
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,790
Do you think people sleep on Alvarez
wrestling because I think they forget.

90
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,340
I forget how good of a
restaurant is and his endurance,

91
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:47,760
but yeah,

92
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,593
it's a scary.

93
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,783
Where did he wrestle?

94
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,420
He was a high level guy.

95
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,261
Division One.

96
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:54,720
Oh yeah.

97
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,553
All American.

98
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,551
I'm not sure.

99
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,330
But uh,

100
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,101
compared to connor.

101
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:58,934
He's fucking Dan.

102
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,441
Yo.

103
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,274
This fight.

104
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,450
This fight is nasty,

105
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,350
right?

106
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,470
We all know that those guys were talking
about Jimmy man who's about to go down

107
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:06,650
and.

108
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:06,880
No,

109
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,160
no,

110
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,291
no.

111
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,340
I'm saying this phrase nasty.

112
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,030
Just not confuse people at home,

113
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,000
but I,

114
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,130
I agree with you man.

115
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,360
I think people sleep on them.

116
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,420
It's too.

117
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,100
You've rolled with like a real division
one wrestler and you realized how

118
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,900
fucking strong the wrestling is.

119
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,243
All American.

120
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,900
That's high school.

121
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,341
National Prep.

122
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,174
All American.

123
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,273
What is,

124
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,140
what is this college wrestling record?

125
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:29,791
He doesn't have one.

126
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:29,980
You.

127
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,860
No college wrestling doesn't
say as college wrestling.

128
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,910
And he got his wrestling
and fricking dream.

129
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,744
How about that?

130
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,140
He bypassed that career
and went right into mma.

131
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,230
So he was a high level
high school wrestling,

132
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,950
which is not as impressive
as a college wrestler,

133
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,750
but when you see him wrestle,

134
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,080
you know he's got some skills
like to stand up though.

135
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,310
He loves trade,

136
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,380
just wants to stand up.

137
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:56,861
Obviously.

138
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,370
It's too smart.

139
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,780
He's been in some of the best,

140
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,081
you know.

141
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,770
So Connor's down in an easy to take
down though to highschool champ.

142
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,300
Chad Mendez begs to differ.

143
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,510
I mean as time goes on,

144
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,990
he's going to be harder and harder to
get that Chad Mendez fight though in

145
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,890
Connor's defense,

146
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,380
he had a pretty fucked up knee
in that fight he was getting.

147
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,360
He was getting stem cell
injections in his knee,

148
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,050
but that's also the only rest where
we've ever seen conor fight taking down

149
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,490
pretty effortlessly.

150
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:21,941
Yeah,

151
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:22,774
that's true.

152
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,470
That's the only thing
we can go off and say,

153
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,313
I got a bad knee.

154
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,153
I get that.

155
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,331
It's tough fight,

156
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:28,571
man.

157
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,670
Because people think Karen's
gonna lock those guys.

158
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,960
They don't know the sport man.

159
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,860
I saw the fire went,

160
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,700
oh fuck.

161
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,270
It's true.

162
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,270
But also I could see
connor just is gonna win.

163
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:39,940
He's gonna if,

164
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,721
if Connor wins,

165
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,554
he's going to Mirko.

166
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,500
Connor has some vicious
fucking power in his hands.

167
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,730
Has Eddie been knocked out?

168
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,173
He's been stopped.

169
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,410
Chandler stopped him.

170
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:50,800
He rear naked choke him
and beat him for the title.

171
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,390
I'm knocked out.

172
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,890
I don't think he's been knocked out.

173
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,170
He's been doing some dog fights.

174
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,810
He's just his game as they come.

175
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,410
I think he's one of those guys that
fight at its very best when he's scared.

176
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:02,771
Correct.

177
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:05,860
I think that's going to be one of the
best things about this fight is that he

178
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,630
thinks conor is a dangerous motherfucker.

179
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,370
Just like he thought how failed on Joe's.

180
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,670
He stopped those signed just in the
first round and a lot of people,

181
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:13,570
including me,

182
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,460
were making the argument that Dos Anjos,

183
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,080
if you look at the guys he's beaten,

184
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,900
stopped cowboy in the first round,

185
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,460
beat the shit out of Nate Diaz,

186
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,210
had us beat pettis up,

187
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,150
stopped Ben Henderson,

188
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,320
crushed him.

189
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,471
I mean,

190
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,090
you look at all the guys that he's beaten.

191
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,420
There's a real argument that he's one
of the best lightweight of all time and

192
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:34,360
then Eddie went and stopped him in the
first round so everyone thought he was

193
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,150
gonna get murdered.

194
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,520
Like you went,

195
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,141
thought Eddie was just.

196
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:36,750
You can get.

197
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,930
It was huge.

198
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:41,500
He doesn't have the marquee
name recognition type thing.

199
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,250
They don't know him yet.

200
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,390
Dangerous fight for conor man,

201
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,740
because he has such a big name.

202
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,603
But yeah.

203
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,930
What if,

204
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,651
if connor does,

205
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:52,651
when you imagine the 55 belt holder is
crazy and then I think you'll forget

206
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,970
about Tony and Tony.

207
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,170
Well,

208
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,300
no,

209
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,530
we're not forgetting about them for sure,

210
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,050
but I think the thing about Eddie Alvarez
is that he has the title and that's

211
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,840
why it's sellable is it was just conor
mcgregor versus Eddie Alvarez and they

212
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,551
didn't have the title.

213
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,331
You can't sell it.

214
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,830
It's just that the Miller garden though,

215
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,290
middle so valuable.

216
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,850
We realize how valuable that title,

217
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,940
because Tony is right in there,

218
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,863
in my opinion,

219
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,000
as is Barboza as as a couple of guys,

220
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,330
Habib number go.

221
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,390
Madoff is of course
everybody's first choice.

222
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,170
She's undefeated.

223
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,720
Nobody's been able to deal with that crap.

224
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,800
Suplex your face,

225
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,640
nasty fucking striker to

226
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,770
give him a.

227
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,491
he's fighting.

228
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,520
He's fighting Michael Johnson
and the next ride in that car.

229
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,990
That's a fucking great fight.

230
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,711
Johnson,

231
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,760
just coming off of the knockout.

232
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,594
A poor ea.

233
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,680
That's a great fight.

234
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,990
Great fight on the main card.

235
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,413
Let's be real.

236
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,610
We always argue what's
the best UFC fight card?

237
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,400
That's the best UFC
fight card of Baltimore.

238
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,100
Even close.

239
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,820
It's like by foot holds up.

240
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,200
Yeah.

241
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,120
If it holds up towards the lineup,

242
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,260
the lineup is insane.

243
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,240
You have three world title fights.

244
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,460
You have our versus conor Mcgregor.

245
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,970
You have tyron Woodley's
fighting wonderboy.

246
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,970
Funny People forget that.

247
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,300
This steven happening because
everybody's talking about other fights.

248
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,140
They forget this fight.

249
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,190
How about Yoni and Jay?

250
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:09,260
Check versus Carolina Cable Kovich.

251
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,401
Come on,

252
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:10,850
man.

253
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,310
Nobody's even talking about
that and then you have Chris.

254
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,620
Why Med versus yellow?

255
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,150
Motherfucking Ramiro.

256
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,090
Come on

257
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,090
then our boy.

258
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,090
Cowboy counseling versus Calvin

259
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,360
and look at.

260
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,360
This is Raquel Pennington
that fights never met.

261
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:32,510
Raquel Pennington is one of the
best Bantam weight in the world.

262
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,400
Nobody talks about her because she's.

263
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,110
She's won some fights in a crazy way,

264
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:38,910
like the Ashley Evan Smith
fight with just had some great,

265
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,941
but she looks.

266
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,270
You took holly home to a
fucking split decision I had.

267
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,840
The girls have lost a lot
though in to eight and six.

268
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,651
They have brawls,

269
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:46,280
Bro.

270
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,480
These girls go after it and
Pennington and in my opinion is super,

271
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,500
super aggressive.

272
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,670
I like watching her fight me.

273
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,080
She got beat up in the last fight.

274
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,790
She did.

275
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,230
God Amanda Nunez Nunez?

276
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:57,500
No.

277
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,011
Oh my God.

278
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,850
Frankie Edgar versus sharpie Stevens.

279
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,303
Fucking.

280
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,650
I almost forgot about that.

281
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,580
That's insane.

282
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,750
Not neuroma.

283
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,010
Johnson.

284
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,910
Holy Shit.

285
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,990
It's not even close.

286
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,760
There's not even a second place.

287
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,600
Holy Shot.

288
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,770
Ticketed entity.

289
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:13,640
Oh my God.

290
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,720
To my favorites.

291
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,200
Holding decided to go gangbusters on this.

292
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,720
Halfway on the towel is fighting.

293
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,740
Tim Timbo a fun fight and that's all fun.

294
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,530
Fight trains in New York with Henzel.

295
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,290
Jim Miller and she'll go.

296
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,910
I was fighting 1:55.

297
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:29,830
This one was first fight.

298
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,330
I call that the throat throwback.

299
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:33,031
Thursday five.

300
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:34,370
Have you seen what Alvarez looks like?

301
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,204
It's crazy.

302
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,750
I have not.

303
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,290
He's reading,

304
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,270
he's way thinner and he's lighter.

305
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:38,541
You know,

306
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,570
you remember when Elvis fought Matt
Hughes when he didn't make weight?

307
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:41,900
Yeah,

308
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,150
and he was a coal rilla.

309
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,620
Just go eat.

310
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,450
The baby girl is so jacked.

311
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,750
It was hair said.

312
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:51,584
See Ya.

313
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,250
He had.

314
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,160
He had muscles that would
start above his and may

315
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,160
look like a pit bull.

316
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,600
Well,

317
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,021
excuse me,

318
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,200
sir.

319
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,640
You're actually turn into a pit bull.
