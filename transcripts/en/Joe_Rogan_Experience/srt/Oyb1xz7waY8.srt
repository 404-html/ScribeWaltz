1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,140
Boom.
And we're alive and well,

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,760
I,
yeah,

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,090
a little closer.
A little closer.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,380
Right about there.
All right.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,010
How are you fell?
It's fantastic.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,440
And how you doing?
Very nice to meet you.

7
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:17,780
Nice to meet you too.
You were remarkably normal.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,853
Oh,
thanks.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,340
I know that people were struck at how
normal I am.

10
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,240
I'm like,
this is like wow.

11
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,970
Really?
I think my roommate through the maze,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,240
I guess sang a famous child.
Yeah.

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,490
Yeah.
That's a very unusual mays.

14
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,490
Uh,
yeah.

15
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,110
Uh,
my life is unique to me.

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,250
That's what I like to say,
you know?

17
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,890
Yeah.
And I'm almost like a pure list person.

18
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,530
Like to a certain extent.
There's not too many people I can look

19
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:41,990
left and right.
And we,

20
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:42,824
you know,
I,

21
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,700
we have similar experiences.
Yeah.

22
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:49,670
Is there anybody that you ever contacted
like Jodie foster or someone who's made

23
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:53,120
it through and seems pretty put
together?

24
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,460
Not really,
no,

25
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,640
not really.
I mean,

26
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,250
it's kind of a weird cold call.
You know what I'm going to say?

27
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,310
Hey jodie foster,
I such a small clan of people,

28
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:06,790
like if a comic called me that I knew,
you know,

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,870
and they wanted to talk to me,
I would talk to them.

30
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,820
Cause it's such a small collection of
people.

31
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,920
I mean we do have our weekly therapy
sessions.

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,840
Yeah.
You know,

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,790
yeah.
Me,

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,270
Elijah Wood,
you know,

35
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,340
Jodie Foster,
you know.

36
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:20,900
Yeah.
Like we all get together and yeah,

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,860
we,
we,

38
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,670
we weep.
You know,

39
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,320
it's actually,
we do primal screaming.

40
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,200
That's what we do.
I was describing when it was like,

41
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:28,300
I have a friend who,
uh,

42
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,930
Ricky Schroeder who,
uh,

43
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,793
is,
um,

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,450
you know,
obviously it was very famous when he was

45
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,940
young as well.
And one of my favorite theme songs,

46
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:37,070
TV theme songs of all times for spoons.

47
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,920
And I was saying that the way you
developed is not like the way the recipe

48
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:45,890
calls,
like the recipe calls for you to have a

49
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:49,850
childhood and try to figure out life and
then become a man and try to find

50
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:53,580
yourself and then try to find your path.
And by the time you be,

51
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,910
he became a man.
He was already famous.

52
00:01:55,911 --> 00:02:00,110
And the same thing with you.
You were already famous as you were

53
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,820
developing and learning.
Yeah.

54
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,763
You know?
Yeah.

55
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,450
I don't know exactly how to like kind of
even describe it because it's always the

56
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:12,440
way my life has been kind of thing.
Like in the same way that like a lot of

57
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,101
kids like,
you know,

58
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:17,690
they'd go out and they catch bugs and
play sandlot baseball or whatever.

59
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:18,501
Like yeah.
He just like,

60
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,060
yeah.
Like that's the way it is.

61
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,630
Like you don't really realize how unique
the whole situation is until you have

62
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:27,080
perspective cause you have nothing to
compare it to really other than I guess

63
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,330
tv shows and movies and things like
that.

64
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,540
So I knew that my upbringing was unique,
you know,

65
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,500
I knew it knew it was different,
but at the same time it's kind of just,

66
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,870
it's not until you get some perspective,
some life experience,

67
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,060
but until you really realize that,
oh wait,

68
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,620
this was,
this was particularly weird.

69
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,630
You know?
I think one of the aspects is

70
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,830
particularly weird about it is a lot of
kids that grow up famous,

71
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:51,520
they grow up on the set.
Yeah.

72
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,650
And they grow up constantly around
people treat them very differently than

73
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,780
everyone else.
It's not just that you're famous,

74
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,620
it's that you're famous and you're also
the complete center attention.

75
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,670
Like you're the reason why we're here.
We're here to do this television show,

76
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,590
we're here to do this movie,
we're here to do this thing.

77
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:07,330
You're the star.
And that,

78
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,300
I think for a kid,
that's a very strange place to be.

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Yeah.
And especially like,

80
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,150
I mean,
I like when I was a kid,

81
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,860
like me,
even before I started working,

82
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,960
I always liked being like the center of
attention kind of thing.

83
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,610
I was definitely,
I was just,

84
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,680
I was very boisterous,
you know.

85
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,903
But,
um,

86
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,970
but in general,
like I'd never really liked being fussed

87
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,960
over.
Like,

88
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:26,830
I didn't like,
you know,

89
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,460
like get the hair and makeup costume
people like poking at you all the time

90
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,950
and things like that.
That actually wasn't a huge fan after a

91
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,350
while of kind of like being that center
of attention.

92
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:35,891
It,
you know,

93
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:38,690
it,
it does become a job after a while.

94
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,460
I'm going to,
yeah,

95
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,920
like early on you kind of just do what
you do.

96
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,900
Look,
that's like I was good at it and boom it

97
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,010
in the same way.
Like they do like anything that you're

98
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,890
like you like it's where the child labor
laws don't apply to acting.

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,090
Yeah,
they do do that.

100
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,371
Yeah.
I'm,

101
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,860
I'm,
I'm pretty well versed in child labor

102
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,591
laws.
Well,

103
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:55,424
it,
how's that work then?

104
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,010
Uh,
it goes from state to state.

105
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,820
Um,
they can work you like,

106
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,840
let's say look in New York,
they can work you 10 hours.

107
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,160
Yeah.
But it stopped right there.

108
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,880
They can work you like you can't get a
job if that's what you're,

109
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,920
that's what you're kind of like,
that's what their limit is.

110
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,950
At the same time you have to get three
hours of schooling in plus an hour of

111
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,030
lunch.
So really you're only,

112
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,510
you're available window is only six
hours or something like that a day.

113
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,090
And then like that also in like in that
six hours,

114
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,850
they're always like setting up the
lights for the next shot and you know,

115
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,830
hurry up and wait kind of part of you
know,

116
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,870
of things.
That's why I like the second home alone.

117
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,320
It took like nearly five months to film
because they can only,

118
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm in virtually every scene and they
can only use me x amount of hours per

119
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,050
day kind of thing.
But isn't that the only job that you can

120
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:40,530
work when you're eight years old?
I don't know.

121
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,000
I,
I you can't be a carpenter.

122
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,910
I mean I guess you can do modeling,
you know,

123
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,480
I mean,
but again,

124
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,260
but like some kind of performing arts
kind of thing,

125
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:50,970
like there are dancers and so forth.
Um,

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,590
cause I was a,
uh,

127
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,570
I was a ballet dancer before I was an
actor.

128
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,120
Like yeah,
I did ballet for a number of years.

129
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm a classically trained ballerina
right here.

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
That Ballerina,
if you're a man,

131
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,520
I,
I call it,

132
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,530
I say I'm a ballet dancer.
Um,

133
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,050
but there is a weird Bella Reno Oh look
at some of them use and I'm like,

134
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,060
I'm not,
I don't think I can call myself a

135
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,740
ballerina.
Like I just can't.

136
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,200
It's too bro.
Like it's from welcome back Kotter.

137
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,000
Exactly.
Babbo Reno Fellow Reno.

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,710
So I did that for a number of years and
there's a bunch of kids that do that and

139
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,170
you get paid and you do the work.
Wow.

140
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
So you know,
there are other,

141
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,670
I guess trades like business though,
right?

142
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,420
Yeah,
yeah.

143
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,190
That's what I mean.
I think it's more than the performing

144
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,470
arts kind of thing.
Like you don't,

145
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,150
you don't see a lot of kids work in the
coal mines anymore.

146
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,650
Like that kind of thing.
Yeah.

147
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,580
For good reason.
Right.

148
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,970
But some people think that that my six
year old dying of black lung,

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,830
you know,
there's some horrible pictures from like

150
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:57,610
the early 19 hundreds of people actually
working in the coal mines when they were

151
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,150
little tiny kids.
Yup.

152
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,170
Yup.
Yeah.

153
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,620
I mean there are no newsies anymore,
you know,

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,290
like,
yeah.

155
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,110
Did you have any say in whether or not
you worked when you were young?

156
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,183
Uh,
not really.

157
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,620
No.
Look,

158
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,550
it was after a while it became,
like I said,

159
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,050
a job and it was,
I like,

160
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,900
I never chose the projects.
They were like,

161
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,370
my parents took,
you know,

162
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:20,410
essentially like chose them for me.
So there was kind of feel news Mccauley.

163
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,440
Yeah,
exactly.

164
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,310
Yep.
Yeah.

165
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,560
They called in the class.
Yeah,

166
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,413
there you go.
Good on.

167
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,400
And like I never read any of the
scripts.

168
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,340
Like I would,
I would just read the lines for like the

169
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,290
next day or whatever.
Like I would like get the gist of what

170
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,740
the movie was about,
but then I just kind of show up and hit

171
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:37,910
my marks,
find my light,

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
you know,
a,

173
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,341
you know,
and,

174
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:40,610
and,
and recite my lines.

175
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,380
Oh,
so real.

176
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,700
It's kind of just like,
again,

177
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,430
it's what you do.
Like,

178
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:48,950
it's like in the same way that like,
like kids go to like school or something

179
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,310
like that.

180
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,641
Like,
you know,

181
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,090
you,
you,

182
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,400
you fall into a routine to a certain
extent,

183
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,510
you know?
Well,

184
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,640
that's the thing about the human mind,
right?

185
00:06:55,641 --> 00:07:00,410
So flexible you could adopt to any sort
of weird scenario and especially when

186
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,470
you're a kid,
I mean you can just bounce,

187
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,560
look on with time adapt so easily.
Exactly,

188
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,960
exactly.
And I always had like a good memory and

189
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,000
things like that.
Like I know I liked,

190
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,943
you know,
I was,

191
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,110
I was big and charismatic and I like had
a good memory like so I could remember

192
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,310
my lines.
Like that's pretty much what like if

193
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:19,821
you,
you know,

194
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:22,910
like not going to give any advice to any
people about like yeah,

195
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,410
you should put your kid into this line
of work.

196
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,340
But at the same time like what producers
really care about is whether or not you

197
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:31,430
remember your lines,
but they like people to get to never

198
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:34,580
work with kids or animals kind of thing.

199
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,950
And again,
they really,

200
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:39,230
all they really care about.
As you remember your lines really liked

201
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:43,550
because I apparently that's a problem.
Like for me it never was like if I ever

202
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:46,040
lost my place,
I would just see the script in my head

203
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,390
and just read it.
Like,

204
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,640
I kind of had a photographic memory back
then.

205
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,300
Oh,
it's faded now I'm 37.

206
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,540
I'm about to be 38 in two weeks.
It feels weird,

207
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,380
doesn't it?
Yeah.

208
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:57,920
You know?
Yeah.

209
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,410
Look up my,
my bowels are different.

210
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,820
Like
what's different about your bowel?

211
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:04,350
Oh yeah.
No,

212
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,970
just like,
uh,

213
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,870
I like she,
I just got,

214
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,713
uh,
uh,

215
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,020
doing some like random checkup kind of
thing and they're like,

216
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,100
oh,
we should scope you.

217
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,450
You know?
So they also,

218
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,380
you know,
they,

219
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,720
I did the,
the scoping like,

220
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:15,020
you know,
in my stomach kind of thing,

221
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,270
but they also,
uh,

222
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,340
you know,
I got a colonoscopy so I was actually

223
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,000
hoping like he's there,
put me under,

224
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,610
so I was like,
it didn't really matter to me,

225
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,890
but I was to put you under for a
colonoscopy.

226
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,700
Yeah,
yeah.

227
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,560
You know,
at least I had that and a scoping.

228
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,550
So I think,
I don't know,

229
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,630
again,
it's down the throat.

230
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,760
I was hoping,
I was actually hoping they were going

231
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,594
to,
uh,

232
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,760
uh,
use the butland first and then put it in

233
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:39,761
my mouth and just asked to mouth boom.
But no,

234
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,870
nothing.
Apparently they use different cameras.

235
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,150
Alright.
Probably designed different,

236
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,530
you don't go as deep.
Right.

237
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,720
But um,
cause they were like all worried I might

238
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:48,850
have an ulcer.
Oh.

239
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,050
Uh,
and so the good good stomach pains or

240
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,090
something kind of,
it's been a little iffy.

241
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,800
And uh,
so the good news,

242
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,050
I don't an ulcer bad news is I have two
ulcers.

243
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,000
So yeah.
So I'm dealing with that.

244
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,400
I've had to like curtail my lifestyle in
general.

245
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,790
Like I'm eating less red meat,
you know,

246
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,830
less carbonated beverages like
Ibuprofen,

247
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,790
no more Ibuprofen.

248
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,830
Like the honest stove.
It's terrible for your gut.

249
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,910
Yeah,
exactly.

250
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,320
So like I've had to like,
you know,

251
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:17,100
I used to like eat like burgers every
single day and now it's like I can have

252
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:19,630
two servings of red meat a week kind of
thing.

253
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:21,810
And it wasn't too hard for me to curtail
my lifestyle.

254
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,790
Look at smoking less,
trying to drink less,

255
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,840
like things like that young guy.
What's the logic behind red meat?

256
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,050
Less I think.
I,

257
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,420
I,
I,

258
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,630
I'm not at the doctor.
Does the doctor have a method to his

259
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,201
madness?
Like,

260
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,180
just yeah.
It's like if you read the list of like,

261
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,830
yeah,
things that are good or bad for your

262
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:39,830
ulcer.
So things that aggravate it.

263
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,150
Exactly.
So red meat like falls into that

264
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,400
category.
It was funny microphone but chicken

265
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,100
doesn't fish doesn't apparently not or
at least you know,

266
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,540
less so weird.

267
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,770
And uh,
yeah my,

268
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,350
cause my special lady friend,
she was like,

269
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:52,770
you know,
worried about me and stuff.

270
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,450
So she was reading up on like,
you know,

271
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,780
ulcers and things like that.
And it was like the first,

272
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,820
like there was like seven things that
like,

273
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,740
that flare it up at all of them were
like check marks for exactly what I was

274
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:06,120
doing in my life kind of thing.
Like,

275
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:08,250
you know,
I like I said red meats,

276
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,960
smoking,
drinking,

277
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,620
like I had just had like a neck issue.
So I was taking a lot of Ibuprofen and

278
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,870
it was just like every single check
mark,

279
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,710
you know.
So,

280
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,570
yeah,
I've read something about Ibuprofen

281
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:22,260
doing it because Ibuprofen disrupts gut
bacteria and they believe that gut

282
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,420
bacteria,
what was there was something really

283
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,970
recent about that,
a real recent study.

284
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,510
They think that they found a new cause
for ulcers.

285
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,960
Like they've changed what they feed
these to think it was caused by stress,

286
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,020
which can do it like also like,
cause I just started again.

287
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,200
I have also had like I've just started a
new company and things like that.

288
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:42,360
So like I have that kind of stress like
kind of thing.

289
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:42,691
Like,
you know,

290
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,261
like,
like I said,

291
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,210
I,
I hit a lot of the checkmarks look at

292
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,270
when you say can do it.
I think what they were saying was they

293
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:51,960
used to think it can do it,
but now they think it's all a matter of

294
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,270
a bacteria in your stomach.
Yeah.

295
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:57,660
I mean I think that's a big part of it.
And also if you like,

296
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,090
uh,
cause I did a movie in Thailand,

297
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,980
uh,
like last year and uh,

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,940
came back,
you know,

299
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,690
came back with a worm.
So what are those like single cell kind

300
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,540
of like,
you know what,

301
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,730
I was getting the medication for it.

302
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,563
I was like,
so what do I,

303
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,400
what should I expect from this?
And he's like,

304
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,710
what do you expect you to get better?
And I go,

305
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,041
yeah,
yeah,

306
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,260
but like,
you know what's like,

307
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,100
am I going to shit a worm?
Am I going to shoot out of it?

308
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:18,671
And they're like,
no,

309
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:19,504
no,
no,

310
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,450
this is one of those single cell ones.
But,

311
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,940
uh,
it made me more susceptible to like

312
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,220
getting ulcers,
you know?

313
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,760
So is this because of the antibiotics
that you had to take for the worm or I

314
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:30,470
think,
I think it just,

315
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,520
it messes with your stomach chemistry
kind of thing after that is when you got

316
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:36,150
the ulcer.
Yeah,

317
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,620
exactly.
Exactly.

318
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,210
So,
you know,

319
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,020
soon dealing with it,
it's actually,

320
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,430
it's actually not so bad.
I'm like,

321
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,270
you know,
I like,

322
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,070
what does it do to you?
How does it,

323
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:44,910
what does an answer do?

324
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,980
You know,
sometimes you kind of get a little pain,

325
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,970
things like that.
Uh,

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,530
um,
uh,

327
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,281
yeah,
look,

328
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:53,320
I mean at one point I was like shitting
like 10 times a day kind thing.

329
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,000
You know what I mean?
Like it was Kinda just like Kinda

330
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,840
loosens your stool a little bit.
Yeah.

331
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,090
It kind of gets mucousy like,
I mean I can go in,

332
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,080
I can go into it.
That's what I mean you're asking me?

333
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,431
Yeah.
All right,

334
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,264
cool.
Yeah,

335
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,790
I find this stuff fascinating.
It is fascinating.

336
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,230
I was like,
what just came out of me?

337
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,450
Ooh.
Also fascinating when you can't see

338
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,310
what's going on.
It's like behind the door,

339
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,960
what's happening?
And then it was,

340
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,090
I can't even listen to it.
And I was like,

341
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,740
what was that?
Was that chicken?

342
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,540
I don't know.
Like which meal was that one?

343
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm like experimenting with my stomach,
seeing when it comes out the other end

344
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:23,810
kind of thing.

345
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,600
And Kenya,
did you experiment at all with

346
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,020
probiotics?
Did you do anything to try to this?

347
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,340
There's a fairly recent thing.
This has only been like in the last,

348
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,930
like not even two months looking last
night.

349
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,330
Kinarum yet,
like eight weeks or so.

350
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,700
So like I am just kind of easing into
this thing.

351
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,070
I have a list,
I made a little list of like things that

352
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:40,300
are good for me,
like you know,

353
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,920
like to eat it,
things like that.

354
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,520
Like,
you know,

355
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,280
make sure I get some yogurt,
like lots of leafy Greens,

356
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,890
you know,
ribbon on your jacket that you've pinned

357
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:52,750
to the safety pin patient badge because
cause I participate in life,

358
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,280
look at me.
So what it's for?

359
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,770
Yeah.
I mean no I mean I went to a a um,

360
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,760
it was a camp like a summer camp themed
wedding,

361
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,250
uh,
back in like almost a year ago.

362
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,930
Something like that.
And so like they were giving out

363
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:06,670
participation badges,
like kind of thing.

364
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,350
Cause if you're participating in things,
but yeah,

365
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:09,600
no,
everyone always asks me about the,

366
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,553
the ribbon.
Like,

367
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,420
cause I kinda just like safety pin.
Yeah.

368
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,171
It kind of just,
you know,

369
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:16,240
like,
I mean I wear like all kinds of things,

370
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,980
but for some reason everyone's like what
does that,

371
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,340
what's that?
No,

372
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,970
I'm participating in life.
Here I am our entire look here.

373
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:23,950
I'm on your podcast.
You are a participant.

374
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,360
I am participating.
You seem really healthy.

375
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,790
Like you seem like a,
like a together person.

376
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,683
Oh yeah.
I know.

377
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,940
It's really,
again,

378
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,600
a shocker for people,
I guess.

379
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,470
So look,
you know,

380
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm actually usually for the most part,
I'm pretty put together.

381
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:38,610
Look,
I,

382
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,071
you know,
yeah,

383
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:39,770
look,
I,

384
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,800
I got a good life now.
I got to have special lady friend.

385
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,060
We have a dog and a cat for a family.
Yeah,

386
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:47,740
exactly.
Like there's one thing to like exchange

387
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:49,660
keys.
It's another to get a cat,

388
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,330
you know,
so we had as you can get a cat together

389
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,990
cause it can kind of go anywhere.
Yeah.

390
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,220
You get a dark together.
That's a,

391
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,260
that's a big one.
That's a certain,

392
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:57,220
yeah,
she already had the dog,

393
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:58,110
but it's like,
it's a,

394
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,310
it's a,
it's a girl and she's a she,

395
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:03,400
but you knew what I,
it looks like a stuffed animal kind of

396
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,150
thing.
And then,

397
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,983
um,
then we have a,

398
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,550
and she's black,
uh,

399
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,730
and then we got a big fluffy white cat
and it's like boy,

400
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,900
girl,
dog,

401
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:11,651
cat.
Like,

402
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:11,981
you know?
Yeah.

403
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,400
Like,
you know,

404
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,720
yeah.
They're really,

405
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:14,590
really,
and they're adorable.

406
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:18,250
Like I've seen dogs and cats play with
each other before and it's kind of cute

407
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,380
and these guys play all the time.

408
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,140
It's actually like,
it's a very special little relationship

409
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,120
that they have.
So cute.

410
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,701
Oh yeah.
No,

411
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:27,270
we never turn on the television,
look in her house and just watch the,

412
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,320
we just watched like the dog and the cat
and stuff,

413
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,040
you know.
Yeah.

414
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,990
Do you,
do you plan on making people?

415
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,220
Oh yeah,
yeah.

416
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,571
No,
I,

417
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:34,404
I want,
I want,

418
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,920
I'm going to make some babies,
you know,

419
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,450
that kind of stuff.
So get this one.

420
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,940
So this one's a good one.
So I'm probably gonna put some babies in

421
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,360

you know,

422
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,310
I mean we're,
we're definitely been practicing,

423
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:45,360
but uh,
yeah,

424
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,360
that's,
that's important.

425
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:46,991
Yeah.
But,

426
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:47,711
uh,

so I'm going to have like,
yeah,

433
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,940
I'm going to have little tiny little
Asian babies.

434
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,170
Yeah.
It's nice.

435
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,700
Yeah.
It's going to be adorable.

436
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,370
Dora a bunch of bunch of,
uh,

437
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,370
Sean Lennon's written around the house.
That's what I'm looking for.

438
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,720
Oh my goodness.
Yeah.

439
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,450
No,

440
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:08,931
like,
you know,

441
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:09,920
like,
uh,

442
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,710
I like,
it's almost like I feel entitled to make

443
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,190
like Asian jokes because I have an Asian
girlfriend kind of thing.

444
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,091
But like,
you're loud.

445
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:17,880
I don't think I'm a,
well,

446
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,910
I do it with her like all the time,
but like,

447
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:21,620
I don't do any public.
Oh yeah.

448
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,560
I know.
It's like,

449
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,631
it's like,
oh,

450
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,351
it's like,
oh baby,

451
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,500

yeah.
She's like,

455
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,220
you're going to be my downfall.
The most hated person in all of music.

456
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:31,820
Yeah,
yeah,

457
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,320
exactly.
Exactly.

458
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,420
Look in here.
It used to be able to,

459
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:37,160
if you were married to an Asian woman
10,

460
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,750
15 years ago,
be no problem.

461
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,150
I think if I,
I think if I have Asian babies,

462
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,790
I'd be allowed to even think so.
Man,

463
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,110
I don't even think so because,
you know,

464
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,710
I,
I,

465
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,390
I'd had to deal with it every kind of
like,

466
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:48,500
day kind of thing.
It's like,

467
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,670
oh well I can,
you know,

468
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,950
I understand the struggle kind of thing.
You know?

469
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,410
I'm trying to shield my kids enough.
Yeah.

470
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,830
You don't come down to such white male,
wealthy,

471
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,260
white male who's famous.
You don't have a chance,

472
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,951
I guess.
I know,

473
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:02,990
right.
All those boxes to buddy.

474
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:03,980
Yeah,
it's true.

475
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,610
It's true.
Privileged blonde haired area and male

476
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,100
who grew up famous.
Yeah,

477
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,790
exactly.
They're just warming their fingers up.

478
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,980
Right.
They're probably write a blog about you

479
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:18,050
thinking that you can make Asian jokes.
I know,

480
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:18,890
I know.
I know.

481
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,560
Well,
that was one of the things that like,

482
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:23,360
you know,
one of the things I really loved about

483
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:25,610
her like was,
I remember when I made my first like

484
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,990
Asian crack liquor and just went to
just,

485
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,100
and she couldn't have stopped and then
she was like,

486
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:31,400
laugh.

487
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,250
She was like,
I can't believe you said that it.

488
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,570
I said,
you know how I know you're Asian?

489
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,440
She goes,
why?

490
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,580
I said,
this is the shape of your eyes.

491
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,470
It's dead giveaway
and she couldn't stop.

492
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:45,080
She was,
that's funny you're allowed to say that.

493
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,030
Yeah.
I can't say because the way you drive

494
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:47,731
bitch.
Yeah,

495
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:52,731
I know exactly what,
you have to have a really good sense of

496
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,450
humor to accept that.
Yeah,

497
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,340
exactly.
Yeah.

498
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:58,040
But you don't have a special
relationship where you guys talk to each

499
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,260
other.
Maybe you are such a good driver.

500
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,020
Like just,
you know,

501
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,853
like just like,
yeah.

502
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,950
Just like no.
Like she's like shut up.

503
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:05,840
Would you stop with the Asian stuff?
Like you know,

504
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,690
cause she actually,
she has an excellent driver so you could

505
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:12,380
tell her you're a really good driver for
yeah.

506
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,670
Because I don't even know why that's
weird.

507
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,410
I don't,
again,

508
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,530
I don't forget I even brought it up.
I'm so not racist.

509
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:26,180
I don't even understand why that's
weird.

510
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,980
Exactly.
Like,

511
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,900
I mean I believe me,
I'm pretty relentless.

512
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,850
But her family,
like they also like they're,

513
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,170
they're down with like the,
you know.

514
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,043
Yeah.
It's,

515
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,230
it's,
I wouldn't even call it a teasing.

516
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,000
It's just like you're just telling jokes
kind of thing.

517
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:38,834
Looking at,
yeah.

518
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,850
Cause I'm the only,
I'm cause I'm the only white boy.

519
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,250
Like,
you know,

520
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,570
when we were visiting the family,
it's like,

521
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,110
I mean,
what brand of Asian?

522
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,203
Um,
uh,

523
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,380
it's tie a Laotian.
Oh Wow.

524
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,233
Yeah,
yeah,

525
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,101
yeah.
I know,

526
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:53,050
I know Leo Ocean know.
Yeah.

527
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,180
Yeah.
Uh,

528
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,160
I just got back from Thailand.
I was just there.

529
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,120
Yeah.
First time ever.

530
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,620
That's where I caught my worm.
Yeah.

531
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,150
Yeah.
So what is this warm like?

532
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,800
Did you find it?
Was it under your skin?

533
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:02,820
Was it,
didn't know what I mean,

534
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,510
like I said,
it's like a single celled kind of when

535
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:05,820
it's in your stomach.
Oh,

536
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,890
it was in your stomach?
Yeah.

537
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:07,980
Yeah.
How did you know you had?

538
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,110
Uh,
I had a lot of fatigue and again,

539
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:14,130
like just like my movements weren't all
that great,

540
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,860
like things like that.
And I remember waking up after about

541
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,210
like a good,
like week or so of it.

542
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,970
We had just wrapped up like,
we were like there for like five,

543
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:22,530
six weeks or something.
Uh,

544
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,630
so I was back in the states and it was
just,

545
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,710
I was sleeping like 20 hours a day.
Like only like waking up to like,

546
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:31,860
yeah,
like just to like just shit pretty much.

547
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,023
And then,
um,

548
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,021
and then,
uh,

549
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:34,471
yeah,
no,

550
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:35,880
I actually,
I remember waking up one of those days

551
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,760
and I said,
I'm pretty sure I have a worm looking to

552
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:38,760
actually just popped in my head.

553
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,210
I go,
look,

554
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,350
this is probably what a worm feels like.
It was almost kind of a mano s kind of

555
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:45,870
like fatigue,
like that kind of thing.

556
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,050
And so have know went there,
some like heavy duty antibiotics for

557
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:51,150
like 10 days.
How do they think you caught it?

558
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,830
Um,
I'm not sure.

559
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,371
Like,
well,

560
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,350
you were on heavy duty antibiotics for
10 days,

561
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,240
that's probably what caused your ulcer.
Yeah,

562
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,170
exactly.
You know what I mean?

563
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,970
Like the worm doesn't help.
And then the heavy duty antibiotics and

564
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,710
like all that stuff,
just kind of look at it.

565
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,331
And also,
again,

566
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:06,150
like lifestyle,
like kind of things,

567
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:06,730
you know,
like,

568
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,291
yeah,
just like,

569
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,100
yeah,
like,

570
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,530
you know,
like I can't pound bourbon like I used

571
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:11,690
to kind of thing.
Like you didn't look,

572
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,770
that's kind of the idea.
Um,

573
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,903
so,
um,

574
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:15,870
but yeah,
yeah,

575
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,010
no it was so I think I caught it from a
cat cause there was actually like a,

576
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,120
we were in a,
uh,

577
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,890
it was Kopi p the,
that,

578
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,310
that island and then that's like cat
islands and we had these little

579
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:29,760
bungalows and I remember I was like,
we were just kinda checking in and I

580
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:32,220
pulled my bag up and there's like this
little like kind of kitten just like

581
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,900
walked up and it was just like,
look,

582
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,363
hey,
can I come in?

583
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,211
And we're like,
yeah,

584
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,080
sure.
Come on in.

585
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:37,341
Look,
I,

586
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,090
I've had a lot of cats in my life and
stuff,

587
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,260
so yeah,
that little,

588
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:41,970
uh,
that little sucker like spent a lot of

589
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:45,330
time and things like that.
And that's probably exactly what we'd

590
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,010
sleep in the bed together and stuff like
that.

591
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,700
Like Zur Bert,
you know,

592
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,490
like,
you know,

593
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,340
you should be tested for toxo plasma
toxoplasmosis.

594
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:56,230
I've actually had that before.
When you have it then yeah,

595
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:57,240
you have it for life.
Yeah,

596
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:57,991
exactly.
No,

597
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,150
I went through the symptoms.
I caught it from an under cooked piece

598
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:01,320
of lamb,
actually.

599
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,290
Yeah.
It's one of the four ways you can get it

600
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,230
kind of thing.
Uh,

601
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,061
no kidding.
Yeah,

602
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:07,800
you can get it from a yeah,
from cats.

603
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,520
You can get it from under cook lamb,
you can get it through a blood

604
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:14,340
transfusion.
And I think the other one is a mother

605
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,770
can transfer it to its B to their baby.

606
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,323
We're looking,
I believe me,

607
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,330
I went to the whole CDC website and
everything like uh,

608
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,700
um,
and that was like mono kind of thing.

609
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,850
Like a lot of people catch it but they
like they just have the antibodies for

610
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,530
it.
And I was a little rundown.

611
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,400
I was doing a play in London for like 10
months and also that kind of going out

612
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,980
at night and things like that.
So I think my body was kind of just like

613
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,770
not it's strongest and boom,
it hit me like a ton of bricks.

614
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,950
Like it was,
it was like mono kind of thing and I was

615
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,040
totally run down.
It's,

616
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,160
I got better after about like three
months or so,

617
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,400
but I didn't get a hundred percent

618
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,010
better for about a year.
There was a crazy article just written

619
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:55,660
about toxo that it had some sort of
impact on people who are,

620
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,100
who startup businesses that the
entrepreneur,

621
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,180
more entrepreneurs have toxoplasmosis.
It's a radically affects behavior

622
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,610
apparently.
Oh yeah.

623
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,430
I mean,
I don't know.

624
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,830
I got it when I was like 20,
so I'm going to ask.

625
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,800
So it makes you more risk taking more,
more.

626
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,410
Um,
it makes you more than hair.

627
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,190
Yeah.
Parasite founding cat poo has been

628
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:19,090
linked to higher likelihood of
entrepreneurial behavior in people who

629
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,680
get infected.
Yeah.

630
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,163
Well,
Hey,

631
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,280
I just launched my own website recently
and they,

632
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,140
that kind of stuff,
you know.

633
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:26,980
Yeah.
So they go,

634
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,840
I blame the toxoplasmosis.
Have you read up on it a lot?

635
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,830
I mean,
any of Robert Sapolsky stuff?

636
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,430
No,
no,

637
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,290
no,
not in a while.

638
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,721
Like,
you know,

639
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,051
like,
I mean,

640
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:41,410
like I said,
I got this like in like 2000 2001 Paul

641
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:41,410
Skis.

642
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,020
Uh,
he's a professor at Stanford and a,

643
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:48,550
he's a biologist and he's,
he specializes in toxoplasmosis and

644
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,100
primate behavior and a lot of of his
biologist.

645
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,770
Right.
So this is a discipline.

646
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,151
But anyway,
he,

647
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:57,970
um,
he's got some amazing talks on it.

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,670
You really should listen to it since you
have it.

649
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,410
Yeah.
It's fascinating stuff.

650
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:05,050
They found a disproportionate number of
motorcycle victims,

651
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,140
people,
motorcycle crashes taking you were

652
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,030
saying.
Yeah.

653
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,720
That's actually,
yeah,

654
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,890
that's fascinating.
Yeah.

655
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,180
It,
you know how it works.

656
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:18,181
So it only,
it can only reproduce inside the cat's

657
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:22,990
gut and it rewires the sexual reward
system of a rat.

658
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,650
So it makes a rat horny when it smells
cat piss.

659
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,550
Oh.
So it completely changes the cats sexual

660
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,030
reward system.
Yeah,

661
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,093
no,
that makes sense.

662
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,510
Excuse me.
The,

663
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:34,841
uh,
the,

664
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:35,400
uh,
um,

665
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,350
like evolutionary advantage,
you know,

666
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,450
of pending to habit,
evolutionary advantage.

667
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,111
It's a,
it's,

668
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:46,111
it actually tricks the cat into killing
the rap and tricks the rat into being

669
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:48,130
horny.
They tend to come around.

670
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,761
Yeah,
exactly.

671
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:50,560
That's what I mean,
there's an evolutionary advantage to

672
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,670
them because like,
yeah,

673
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,260
like if you,
if you're a cat and you have

674
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:55,450
toxoplasmosis,
like it's going to,

675
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,350
uh,
you know,

676
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,420
it's going to,
to attract your pray to you.

677
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,160
Well,
it actually doesn't know.

678
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,540
It doesn't work that way.
Um,

679
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,580
it,
the rat has to be infected.

680
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,090
When the rats infected,
then it smells cat urine and it gets

681
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:08,750
horny when the cats,
in fact,

682
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,770
it doesn't do anything to the cat.
It seems to have no change in the

683
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,870
behavior of the cabinets and it gets to
people.

684
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,570
Yeah.
So it only affects really the behavior

685
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:17,950
of people and rats.
Yeah.

686
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,220
It's weird.
Yeah.

687
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,560
But yeah,
no,

688
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,610
I caught it.
I got the,

689
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,590
uh,
got the antibodies for it or whatever.

690
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,390
It's one of those like forever kind of
things,

691
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,970
but it doesn't affect me like at all.
Like,

692
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,770
you know what I mean?
There's no hell urgent issue.

693
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,043
Oh,
health issue.

694
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,511
Yeah.
That's what I mean.

695
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:31,751
Like,
yeah,

696
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:32,441
no,
it's like a,

697
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:33,161
it's just,
it's a,

698
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,540
you know,
it was one of those things where like,

699
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,820
yeah,
I got sick for a couple of months and

700
00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:37,654
then boom.
I'm,

701
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,680
like I said,
it was like Mano,

702
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,530
I think it was just tired.
Disproportionate number of successful

703
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:46,010
soccer teams that come from countries
that are of high rates of toxoplasma

704
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,480
infection,
I should get into soccer.

705
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,190
Well,
it's just one of those things.

706
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:49,960
It's just,
it,

707
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,820
it changes the way people behave.
Make some,

708
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,620
make some little wilder.
So,

709
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,540
uh,
you're saying you're,

710
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,580
you're interested in some toxoplasmosis
and the might already have it.

711
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,220
Yeah.
Tacho your checked Tuxedo Gundy or

712
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:04,140
whatever it is.
Looking at [inaudible] [inaudible]

713
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,690
hasn't gotten,
was this movie in Thailand?

714
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,500
Uh,
is,

715
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,000
my buddy has,
seth green was a,

716
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:13,001
he wrote and directed a movie and so he
asked me to do something in it and you

717
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:13,790
know,
like,

718
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,160
cause I don't really pursue acting like
at all off kind of thing.

719
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,770
And now I'm not saying it was a favor or
anything like that,

720
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,030
but at the same time it was like,
yeah,

721
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,530
like it sounds like fun.
So,

722
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,910
uh,
it's cool cast.

723
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,850
It's like him,
he's in a brick and Myers and it,

724
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,860
uh,
Brenda Song,

725
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,060
uh,
me.

726
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,560
So do you just like do whatever you want
these days and just occasionally act

727
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:34,490
when it comes up?
Yeah,

728
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,301
if it comes up,
like,

729
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,170
you know,
if it's a cool look,

730
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,400
neat little gig or something like that,
like,

731
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:37,970
yeah,
sure.

732
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,260
But like I said,
I don't pursue it in any kind of like

733
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,620
any way,
like I don't have agents anymore and

734
00:24:42,621 --> 00:24:44,090
things like that.
Is that because you're just not

735
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,370
interested or kind of 19 shit?
I don't really like the,

736
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:48,410
uh,
the pursuit of it,

737
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,221
you know,
like,

738
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,960
yeah.
Like what it takes to assess.

739
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,160
Exactly.
I don't like,

740
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,480
I don't like being on the circuit kind
of thing looking at.

741
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,323
Yeah.
So,

742
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,171
uh,
but yeah,

743
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:57,541
no,
I,

744
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,610
um,
you know,

745
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,020
I write a lot,
I paint a lot.

746
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:02,480
Like I just kind of always have like
some kind of projects.

747
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,920
And then also,
like I said,

748
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:07,310
we've got the website,
a bunny ears.com kind of thing.

749
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,540
And what does that,
that is a,

750
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,760
it's a comedy website.
It's pretty much,

751
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,380
uh,
like,

752
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
uh,
like,

753
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:14,250
you know,
how all these celebrity,

754
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:17,360
especially like ladies,
they have those lifestyle websites,

755
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:18,320
all of them.
Well,

756
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:19,430
a lot of them do,
you know,

757
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:20,750
look at it like Goop,
you know,

758
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,610
it was one of them that I know of.
Is there other ones?

759
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:22,931
Oh,
yeah,

760
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:23,391
yeah.
No,

761
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:23,990
it's like,
yeah,

762
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,090
it's a goop ones.
The most egregious though.

763
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,620
Yeah.
Well that's the thing is that,

764
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:30,020
so this is,
this is like goop meets the onion.

765
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,170
A scoop is like goop meets the onion.
Yeah,

766
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:35,530
I knew all yet.
But accident accidentally,

767
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,290
you know?
Yeah.

768
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,360
They're telling you to put jade balls up
your vagina.

769
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,140
I know.
Believe me,

770
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,580
we,
we had a banana years.

771
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,420
Yeah.
We have,

772
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,280
we have an article beach in a hot,
hold on.

773
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:44,630
What does that do?

774
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,441
That thing.
Oh,

775
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:48,560
annoying.
How to have sex on a beach in a hot tub

776
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:50,840
and other things that seemed fun as a
virgin.

777
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,760
It's Hannah Hannah.
She's a or hunter.

778
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,000
She's at fantastic writer.
And you got a little scroll and things

779
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:00,940
like saying you have a podcast as well.
Yeah,

780
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,220
we do a podcast also.
Um,

781
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,120
and we're,
we're revving up some,

782
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:07,130
uh,
more like video content and things.

783
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,391
But uh,
yeah,

784
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:13,010
so this is just a fun project.
It's got a lot of really great writers,

785
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,520
like comedy writers and stuff.
Yeah.

786
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,590
It's kind of just like,
oh look,

787
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,110
there's a good article about a jade egg.
Like,

788
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,630
oh,
I put a jade egg up by her vagina and I

789
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:21,920
catch a jade bird,
you know,

790
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:22,900
like that kind of thing.
Like,

791
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,500
you know,
and then like,

792
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,100
I,
you know what to do about your bird

793
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:28,000
living in your vagina.
Now it's like things like,

794
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,531
you know what I mean?
We're,

795
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:30,170
we're kind of like taking the piss out
of like,

796
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,950
you know,
some of these kind of like lifestyley

797
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,220
websites,
you know,

798
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,063
it's like,
um,

799
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,521
it's like,
you know,

800
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,990
they'll have articles like on coop about
like,

801
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,630
oh,
the best cabernets like for like $200 or

802
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,464
something.
That,

803
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,320
and it's like,
ours is like the best Bourbon's under,

804
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:43,380
you know,
$20.

805
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,450
But then like,
it turned,

806
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,820
the spelling gets worse and worse and
then it turns into a rant about your ex

807
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:48,654
girlfriend.

808
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,780
So like,
things like that,

809
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:52,291
it's,
it's,

810
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,490
it's some really good stuff.
Like I said,

811
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:55,010
we have a really,
really great team of,

812
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:56,830
of people and uh,
yeah,

813
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,790
it's kind of like I said,
taking the piss out of things and stuff.

814
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,770
So you just decided to do this just for
fun.

815
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,030
Yeah,
I kind of had this idea,

816
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:05,040
it was kind of kicking it around and so
forth.

817
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,060
And then I felt like I kind of
accumulated enough ideas and then,

818
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:09,540
uh,
yeah,

819
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,890
then I started kind of vultron owning
it.

820
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,770
Like just grabbing the assembling,
you know,

821
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,650
like this,
this,

822
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:14,670
this,
this,

823
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:15,810
this project,
this giant,

824
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,980
giant robot,
you know?

825
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:18,800
Yeah.
So there we go.

826
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,141
It's,
it,

827
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:19,974
it,
it's a lot of fun.

828
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,761
It's,
and it's,

829
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:21,990
it is funny,
like we have a look,

830
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:24,390
I said there's actually a look.
Those articles are really well written,

831
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:25,470
like we have one about,
um,

832
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,570
uh,
do you see infinity war?

833
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,420
Uh,
yeah,

834
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,180
the vendors were,
yeah,

835
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,300
because,
oh,

836
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:34,920
it's fantastic.
It's fantastic.

837
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,260
But we were like,
we made our own infinity gauntlet.

838
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,720
And what happens is like in a spoiler
alert,

839
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,200
uh,
is like,

840
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,250
a lot of the people kind of just vanish.
Like they kind of just die.

841
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,611
Like,
you know,

842
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:47,160
they turn into dust in a movie,
in the movie at the end.

843
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,080
So like when you start reading the
article,

844
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,063
uh,
um,

845
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,450
uh,
eight,

846
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,310
all of a sudden,
just all the words just starting

847
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:55,910
vanishing.
And then you have to go back and,

848
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:56,970
and again,
it's like a,

849
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,010
even like the letters,
like we actually had a,

850
00:27:59,011 --> 00:27:59,670
a,
um,

851
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,960
we did one where it was a ransom letter.
Um,

852
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,480
one of our writers,
she,

853
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,630
um,
her father is actually the therapist for

854
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,550
Goop,
like the extra like psychiatrists,

855
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,250
the official one.
So we do pass their own therapist,

856
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,240
you know?

857
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,030
Yes.
But is it like a weekly advice therapist

858
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:17,370
or is it just like therapy just for
being on goop?

859
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,730
Like I know you're here because you're a
mass,

860
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:23,070
so here just read this,
read this.

861
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:24,840
It's okay.
So we're here for you.

862
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,530
So we got pictures of him bound and
gagged and it's like dear goop,

863
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,420
like we kidnapped your therapist,
uh,

864
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:35,190
w you can only get him back if you give
us your seven hot tips for,

865
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:35,621
you know,
yeah.

866
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:36,454
Like,
uh,

867
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,010
uh,
for facial washes for this summer and

868
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,820
you know what?
They actually good on them.

869
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,360
They responded and they actually like
sent us over like a list of like,

870
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,650
here are the hot light.
Kind of like,

871
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:47,911
I was like,
you know,

872
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:49,620
good for them.
Like they had a sense of humor about the

873
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:50,500
whole thing.
Look at again,

874
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,020
they have two,
they're called goop.

875
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,300
Yeah.

876
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,030
We won't,
we almost,

877
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:58,170
we thought about naming ours Puig uh,
that's probably sue.

878
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,711
Yeah,
I know.

879
00:28:58,711 --> 00:28:59,131
I was like,
Hey,

880
00:28:59,131 --> 00:28:59,461
look at me.
No,

881
00:28:59,461 --> 00:28:59,880
no,
no.

882
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,110
So,
um,

883
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,140
so you're basically financially set from
all those movies.

884
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,400
So I do okay for myself,
but do you just put that money away and

885
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:10,860
just live off the interest is how much?
Pretty much,

886
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,550
you know.
Yeah.

887
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,300
And uh,
yeah,

888
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,960
I've,
I'm able to kind of live the life that,

889
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:17,690
you know,
like that I,

890
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,530
that my circumstances afforded me.
I'm,

891
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,780
like I said,
I'm very,

892
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:22,710
very,
very lucky.

893
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,360
Um,
you know,

894
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,520
lots of weird things happen to kids all
the time,

895
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,990
all around the world.
Every day.

896
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,640
You know,
I,

897
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,630
I have something to show for it,
you know,

898
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:30,950
like,
yeah.

899
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,351
Like,
you know,

900
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:32,370
so it's nice.
I can,

901
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,050
I can live.
Um,

902
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,130
what does it,
it's uh,

903
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,290
my buddy jack,
he goes to a weird way to describe a

904
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,040
movie career.

905
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,840
Yeah.
I'm pretty much weird things happen to

906
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:40,571
kids.
Yeah.

907
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,070
Man.
I some money out of it.

908
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,050
Look,
I'm not working like the diamond mines.

909
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm going to child soldier.
You know what I mean?

910
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:46,930
Like,
okay,

911
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,330
I came up the other end,
uh,

912
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,100
and you have something to show for it.
And I'm very like,

913
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,590
I do feel blessed every morning kind of
thing.

914
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,030
Let's see.
You're happy that it all worked out.

915
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:55,864
That one.
Yeah.

916
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,760
You can go back and do it again when you
do it the same way.

917
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,030
Knowing what I know now.
I mean probably I probably,

918
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,530
yeah,
I probably be even more charming.

919
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,230
I do it just better.
Of course you would,

920
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:08,741
right?
Yeah,

921
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,770
exactly.
Now imagine if you'd just have your

922
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:13,650
brain in a little kid's body.
Uh,

923
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,230
yeah,
I know.

924
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,150
I,
I would kill it grade school.

925
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,920
I would so kill it.
Like in school,

926
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,660
like Oh,
psychological warfare.

927
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,120
They wouldn't know what's coming.
Yeah,

928
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,030
yeah.
Just their little brains up and nuts.

929
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,840
Exactly.
That would be great.

930
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,140
I'm pretty sure that's what a 30 going
on 13 was.

931
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:32,590
Right.
And that goes to Jennifer Gardner movie.

932
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,410
I have no idea what any Jennifer garden
wounds are.

933
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,303
Well,
you know,

934
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,390
now you do three going on 13.
Yeah.

935
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,550
Like a a brain swap one kind of.
Yes.

936
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,810
But she like,
yeah.

937
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,870
How original or adult brain goes into
her

938
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,080
freaky Friday you're looking at,
yeah.

939
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,640
So it's kind of a freaky Friday with
some time travel.

940
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:56,500
I guess so.
Yeah.

941
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,730
So you're gonna,
you're gonna,

942
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,280
you're going to Netflix it tonight,
aren't ya?

943
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,940
Nope.
I could tell it that can,

944
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,140
that can see it.
Like you've been thoroughly charmed by,

945
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:06,130
uh,
Jennifer Gardner.

946
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,380
I can tell him interesting life you have
then you,

947
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:10,240
so you just kind of do whatever you
want.

948
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah.
My friend Genx is,

949
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,540
I'm a man of leisure.
That's the way he described.

950
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:16,480
It's like my life and lifestyle.
That's a good way to describe it.

951
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,351
And it's true.
And look,

952
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:20,380
I kind of looked at him kind of,
I'm going to spend some time just like

953
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,350
jumping around like Europe or something
like that.

954
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:22,811
Like,
you know,

955
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:25,030
and just like where you lived in Paris,
who were saying,

956
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
yeah.
Lived there for a number of years.

957
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:28,690
I mean,
I still have,

958
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,070
I still have my place there,
but,

959
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,610
uh,
since like 2013 so many things,

960
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,590
it's only in the last year I've been
kind of spending more time in the

961
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:37,900
states.
Was it that brought you to Paris?

962
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,010
Well,
the food sucks.

963
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:40,780
The wines terrible and the women are
ugly.

964
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,990
But uh,
but otherwise it's fantastic.

965
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:46,570
Yeah,
no,

966
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,880
it's okay.
It was an agreeable lifestyle.

967
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,430
I did a bunch of friends out there.
They were always asking me,

968
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,040
what are you gonna move to Paris and
winning to learn French.

969
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,650
Okay.
Like the or your friends in Paris.

970
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,790
And I was there just kind of like,
I was just kind of jumping around a

971
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,870
little bit.
And so,

972
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,600
um,
I thought about it for a second and I

973
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:05,434
went,
you know what,

974
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,333
how's next week?

975
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,880
So I said,
I'm going to leave my bags here,

976
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,920
I'm going to fly back to New York.
I'm going to going,

977
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,230
you know,
I'll put my affairs in order.

978
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,180
And I said,
I'll be back next week.

979
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,741
I said,
I'll,

980
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:17,260
I'll,
I'll,

981
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,690
I'm ready to live here.
I mean,

982
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,660
I realized that if I could pick up and
just move to France on a whim,

983
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,940
um,
and it wouldn't affect like,

984
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,740
you know,
like anyone's life or it wouldn't hurt

985
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,040
anybody or think I'd be remiss if I
didn't look,

986
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:30,551
you know what I mean?
Like,

987
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:31,361
yeah,
like how many,

988
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:33,160
how many times am I like,
I couldn't do that now,

989
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,650
but I could do it back then kind of
thing.

990
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,761
So it was like,
yeah,

991
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,270
like,
no,

992
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,440
I should just fuck it.
Look,

993
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:39,261
I'm,
I'm good.

994
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,490
I'm,
I'm going to live in Paris now.

995
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,360
Gonna yeah.
And it was,

996
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,110
it was great.

997
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,720
It was a lot of people who've done that.
Johnny Depp lived there for a little

998
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:45,890
while.
I know Richard,

999
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:48,520
he still has a place there for awhile.
You know,

1000
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:49,640
it's,
it's a special place.

1001
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,930
I mean,
what's special about it?

1002
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,190
Um,
I mean,

1003
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,110
again,
food and wine's fantastic.

1004
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,370
Like the girls are pretty,
like,

1005
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,910
it's the leisurely kind of like
lifestyle a little bit.

1006
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,980
Like I like,
I like their eating habits,

1007
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,100
I get it.
It's like a light breakfast and kind of

1008
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:06,440
gets heavier as you kind of go along in
the day.

1009
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,180
Uh,
you kind of eat later,

1010
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,230
which is kind of like,
you know,

1011
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:10,064
like,
like,

1012
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,910
oh,
you're American,

1013
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:14,200
you must want to eat dinner at like
eight in the time of day.

1014
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,450
I like 10:00 PM 10:00 PM is like a,
you know,

1015
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:17,910
kind of,
uh,

1016
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,570
you know,
ideal like dinner kind of time.

1017
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,030
Um,
they don't like to work hard either,

1018
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:23,660
right?

1019
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,620
I mean,
no,

1020
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:25,820
I mean they,
I mean they work,

1021
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:26,391
I mean,
I think,

1022
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:28,760
you know,
I like to take their time and yeah,

1023
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:29,690
everything is like,
yeah,

1024
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:30,800
it's like,
you know,

1025
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,760
I'll sit up a card game for like three
30 and three 30 means like five,

1026
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:35,890
you know,
again,

1027
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,090
that's just the way,
like everyone's kind of always late,

1028
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:39,480
but it's no big deal.
That's the thing.

1029
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,750
I remember one time coming and I'm like,
oh gosh,

1030
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:42,070
like,
you know,

1031
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,330
it was just like,
where are they kind kinda.

1032
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,173
And then I realized,
I'm like,

1033
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,000
wait,
what is the hurry w for real?

1034
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,890
Like what is the hurry?
It's like,

1035
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,280
I have other plans.
My plan is to hang out,

1036
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,770
like,
you know,

1037
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,940
with you guys.
And so,

1038
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,850
and all of a sudden the stress would
just kind of just melt away.

1039
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,750
I'm like,
yeah,

1040
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:59,090
like look,
you can just be more leisurely and

1041
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:00,080
stuff,
uh,

1042
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,570
about things out there and everyone's
looking at,

1043
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,270
like I said,
it's,

1044
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,160
it's,
it's really cool.

1045
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,860
They like Americans out there.
That's a misconception and if they don't

1046
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:07,970
like,
they don't like the loud,

1047
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,560
obnoxious Americans with the,
you know,

1048
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,830
mickey mouse tee shirt and the fatty
stuff.

1049
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,700
Yeah,
no,

1050
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,450
it was a fanny packs.
How dare you.

1051
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:15,590
And I did.
I did have one.

1052
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,323
It's all right.
It's all right.

1053
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,140
Yeah.
Wonderful.

1054
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,591
Yeah,
you got it.

1055
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,111
Yeah.
Got Nice.

1056
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:22,070
Like leather one,
you know,

1057
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,310
I used inside pockets.
I got,

1058
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,740
I got an insight that that's my purse.
Well that works too.

1059
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,640
I also have this,
I have a Satchel that I,

1060
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:31,890
I travel around with also like,
yeah,

1061
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,901
yeah,
yeah,

1062
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:34,250
exactly.
Yeah.

1063
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,120
You know what,
it's actually,

1064
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:36,590
I do call it my purse,
like,

1065
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,060
you know,
in day to day kind of thing.

1066
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,960
Cause it's like someone's like,
oh,

1067
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:40,880
that's a Satchel or it's immerse.
I'm like,

1068
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,160
no,
no,

1069
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,350
no,
it's a purse look like no,

1070
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,130
no illusions here.
Isn't it funny that you would be

1071
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,600
insulted or more positive about it if
had a different sound coming out of your

1072
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:51,480
mouth?
Right.

1073
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,200
And it's like,
no,

1074
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,850
no,
no.

1075
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,320
It's exact same thing.
It's purse.

1076
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,450
Yeah.
So,

1077
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,370
um,
what happened there?

1078
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,440
Why did men,
how can we can a person,

1079
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,360
right.
No one's going to do that.

1080
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:06,320
Like me know there's a few bold souls
that we'll put on a fanny pack and walk

1081
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,380
out into public.
Yeah.

1082
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,120
But it's not a lot of people that will
just ask you just called yourself bold.

1083
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,800
There's not a lot of people that would
wear a,

1084
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,660
uh,
an actual purse,

1085
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:20,590
like a Louis Vuitton purse.
I mean,

1086
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,140
I'm secure enough in myself and like
everything like,

1087
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:25,890
like yeah,
I can pull up the purse.

1088
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,010
Look,
I mean I wear fingernail Polish and you

1089
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,630
know,
I have participation badge.

1090
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:32,690
Like I've gotten like I did you have
like fingernail stripes?

1091
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,290
Yeah,
all Polish.

1092
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,530
But like a little bit.
Yeah.

1093
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,500
I actually,
I almost,

1094
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,860
I actually do it on purpose.
Look aids,

1095
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,110
they do make my fingers a little too
feminine if it's done perfectly.

1096
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,400
So,
but I'm actually really good.

1097
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,620
When I did that movie party monster,
I learned a lot of like,

1098
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:49,860
just fun makeup.
He kind of things and ways to make your

1099
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,870
fingers look like they're like,
you're like,

1100
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,790
look,
there are two weeks old when really

1101
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,800
liking her yet technically,
I mean,

1102
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,990
I could've like painted these yesterday
and they would look like this kind of

1103
00:35:58,991 --> 00:35:59,330
thing.

1104
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,270
Yeah.
But I'm always,

1105
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,900
I always just like nail Polish in and
say,

1106
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,560
you know?
Yeah.

1107
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,730
Um,
but yeah,

1108
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,650
no,
I'm secure enough to like wear a purse

1109
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:08,400
or something like that.
Like,

1110
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,540
you know,
I want to shoot with that.

1111
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,700
Oh No.
I don't have to wear a backpack though.

1112
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,940
That's where it's weird.
What's this Mickey Rourke.

1113
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,220
Oh yeah,
he's got,

1114
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,970
uh,
what are the school that was called a

1115
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,570
clutch sit.
Yeah.

1116
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:21,780
Yeah.
That looks more like a clutch.

1117
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,430
Yeah.
But he's so eccentric.

1118
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,240
I met him this past weekend.
He had a crazy cowboy hats.

1119
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,720
We're looking at a picture of Mickey
Rourke.

1120
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,200
You had a crazy cowboy hat on and he's
just,

1121
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,491
yeah,
he's,

1122
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,550
he seems like a cook.
I mean you can see that that belt buckle

1123
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,660
like really like that one is,
you know,

1124
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,730
that's something I'm looking at again,
look good on him.

1125
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,820
Yeah.
And he's just an odd duck.

1126
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,850
I for some reason it reminds me of,
it was an old onion article and it's one

1127
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:51,420
of my favorite headlines and it was
Johnny Depp found to be 90% scarfs.

1128
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,260
Yeah.
He counted like way scarfy after the

1129
00:36:58,261 --> 00:36:59,410
whole pirate movies.
Yeah.

1130
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,370
He went straight scarf like where are
the rest of his life kind of thing.

1131
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:02,701
He was like,
yeah,

1132
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:03,331
he,
he really,

1133
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:07,320
he really committed to that scarf thing
when you're a beautiful man like that.

1134
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:10,170
It's an odd transition to being like a
55 year old.

1135
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,200
I like what's up with Johnny Depp
lately?

1136
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,290
Not good things.
I know.

1137
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,740
It's,
it's really strange actually.

1138
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:21,270
They just,
this morning they delayed or like

1139
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,700
actually like or canceled.
He is a notorious B I g movie looking at

1140
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,070
that.
He's in with forest whitaker,

1141
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,350
uh,
and it was suppose to come out next

1142
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,430
month and they just pulled it from the
schedule and they haven't like even said

1143
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,300
it's ever going to come out or
something.

1144
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,790
And it's like,
and even just like looking at pictures

1145
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,230
of him,
like it kind of just like there's

1146
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:40,240
something off about him and hope he used
to be,

1147
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,700
he used to be really great.

1148
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,360
You said,
you know,

1149
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,410
what'd you do to him?
You fuck,

1150
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,460
I don't even know who that is.
Doug Stanhope one of the best standup

1151
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,100
comedians ever.
Uh,

1152
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,540
there you go.
He's a,

1153
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,660
I'm more of a Steven Wright fan myself.
Me Too.

1154
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,730
Yeah.
No love Steven.

1155
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,670
Right.
But I think,

1156
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,530
uh,
I think Johnny's just,

1157
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:02,460
uh,
he hit that weird spot where you're just

1158
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:05,670
too fucking famous.
You can't go anywhere where you were

1159
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:07,230
when you were little,
I'm sure.

1160
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,030
But you can coast now,
right?

1161
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:12,060
You can go places like how,
how rich is rich enough?

1162
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,691
Like,
dude,

1163
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,471
like ground look.
Yeah,

1164
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:14,304
look,
that's what it means.

1165
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,110
Not just that,
but he spends,

1166
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,880
he only 14 houses.
He owns an island.

1167
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,480
Millions and millions of dollars.
Did he spend like $5 billion shooting?

1168
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,890
Uh,
uh,

1169
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,030
a hunter s Thompson is the Canon.
They them like,

1170
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,300
did you spend $1 million?
Cause no,

1171
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,550
of course not.
I spent $3 million.

1172
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,980
They asked him about his wine habit.
They

1173
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,551
said,
uh,

1174
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:40,450
your attorney said that your wine habit
is $30,000 a month.

1175
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,560
And he goes,
that's an insult.

1176
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,850
It's far more than,
it's far,

1177
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:44,490
far more than that.
Now that's,

1178
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,820
you mean like how lean and like,
all right,

1179
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:47,500
cool.
Like I guess she has to maintain it and

1180
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,810
you know that lifestyle.
Well that's what he wants for himself.

1181
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,880
That's what he's doing.
That's his life.

1182
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,500
His life is spending all that money.
Yeah.

1183
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,640
Like his whole life is doing movie that,
you know,

1184
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,470
people though also when they're,
they're involved in laborious projects

1185
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,750
that they're not really interested in.
You know,

1186
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,120
when you're,
when you're doing something all day,

1187
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,490
and I say this is a guy who hosted fear
factor

1188
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,640
that you don't really enjoy doing while
you're doing it,

1189
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:16,810
you're like,
okay,

1190
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,180
time to go to work.
I mean it was very thankful to have the

1191
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:19,630
job.

1192
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,270
Don't get me wrong,
but the reality is it was not enjoy.

1193
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:26,890
It wasn't a fruitful endeavor.
It wasn't like working for the UFC are

1194
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:28,970
doing standup comedy or even doing a
podcast.

1195
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,790
It wasn't a passion project.
Exactly.

1196
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:34,810
So when you do something like that,
like people on bad sitcoms in

1197
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:37,030
particular,
they spend all their fucking money.

1198
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:37,864
They go crazy.
Yeah.

1199
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,080
Because the only thing that they look
forward to is what am I going to do with

1200
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:43,380
this money?
We're to buy a Ferrari,

1201
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,640
I'm going to buy a mansion,
I'm going to buy an island.

1202
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,370
That's,
I think that's what Johnny got into.

1203
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,273
Yeah.
I,

1204
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,710
I couldn't see myself like doing a
sitcom or a television show kind of

1205
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:54,700
thing.
Like what about a good,

1206
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,490
a good one?
I do like news radio's a fantastic show

1207
00:39:57,491 --> 00:40:00,070
look like you must have been that.
That must have been like a fruitful

1208
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:00,700
endeavor.

1209
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,400
Reason why I never did another one.
Yeah,

1210
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,970
exactly.
They don't want to ruin that experience.

1211
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,590
Every other one that came along was
like,

1212
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,820
this is shit go.
They,

1213
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,380
they pursued me for,
for me,

1214
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,960
for a big bang theory.
Oh Christ,

1215
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,790
you got lucky and didn't get that.
And I said,

1216
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,750
no.
I said like,

1217
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,520
no,
cause it was kind of like the way that

1218
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,540
pitch was,
it was kind of just like,

1219
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,740
all right,
these two like astrophysicist nerds and

1220
00:40:18,741 --> 00:40:21,910
then a pretty girl lives with them.
He links like,

1221
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:25,210
you know,
and like that was the pitch and it was

1222
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,590
like,
yeah.

1223
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,521
And they're like,
oh,

1224
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,020
we're going to get some real like
physicists to like,

1225
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,860
you know,
do the math.

1226
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,641
And I said,
no.

1227
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,600
I said,
I'm cool.

1228
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:34,480
Like thanks.
And then they came back at me again and

1229
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:34,991
I said,
no,

1230
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:35,390
no,
look.

1231
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,270
I'm like again,
flattered.

1232
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,320
But like,
no.

1233
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,130
And then,
then they came back at me again and then

1234
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:43,610
like even my manager,
it was like twisting my arm and I like,

1235
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,680
listen,
I'd have hundreds of millions of dollars

1236
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:49,600
right now.
I feel like if I did that Gig at the

1237
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,700
same time,
I'd be bashing my head against the wall.

1238
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,870
That's the thing.
Yeah.

1239
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,870
I think that's what Johnny Depp's doing
and we can't really be into those pirate

1240
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:56,561
movies.
Yeah,

1241
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:57,071
no,
he's just,

1242
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:58,600
he's interested.
And that's the thing is that like,

1243
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:01,750
he wasn't always like that all,
it's like all about the money.

1244
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,621
Right.
This is a thing,

1245
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,410
I read an article,
an interview with him,

1246
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,470
it was about two decades ago and he was
talking about,

1247
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,580
you know,
he was in his thirties,

1248
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:11,860
and he was doing a lot of weird,
obscure movies.

1249
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:13,480
Like what's that movie,
dead man,

1250
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:15,940
that black and white?
Yeah.

1251
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,550
He did a lot of weird shit.
And he said,

1252
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,890
this is kind of what I really like and I
don't,

1253
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:23,590
I'm not blockbuster boy,
which is what he said.

1254
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,780
It's so ironic.
Ironic.

1255
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:28,210
They had no,
the couple pull quotes and blockbuster

1256
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:28,670
boy.
Yeah,

1257
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,111
no,
he goes,

1258
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:29,711
yeah,
if I ever,

1259
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:31,630
like if you're,
if I'm ever a part of like a franchise,

1260
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:32,950
like just shoot me or something like
that.

1261
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,510
Yeah.
They're pulled up these weird like old

1262
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:36,500
quotes.
It was a,

1263
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,360
um,
it's like the George Lucas,

1264
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,830
like when he,
uh,

1265
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,090
he testified before Congress about the
colorization of movies and talking about

1266
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:48,230
how movies are or are part of our
heritage and you know,

1267
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:50,390
they shouldn't be tampered with or
anything.

1268
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:55,391
He goes back 25 years later he's going
back and redoing his movies and it's

1269
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:55,821
like,
yeah,

1270
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,980
no,
like once you put art out there,

1271
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,450
leave it alone,
leave it alone with,

1272
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:00,650
no,
it's not yours anymore.

1273
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,070
Like that's the thing,
like once you show like your paintings,

1274
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,950
like that's not yours anymore.
That's the worlds,

1275
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,310
that's an interesting way of looking at
it and you don't think it's theirs

1276
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,570
anymore.
Imagine imagining Divinci like,

1277
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,050
like just all of a sudden came back into
existence right now and he wants to

1278
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:16,820
change the Mona Lisa.
She's fat.

1279
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,410
Like I kind of didn't get,
I didn't get the smile right?

1280
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,420
Yeah,
exactly.

1281
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,090
It's all pulled back and shit.
I want to say it.

1282
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:29,810
So should he be able to change it?
I want to give us some fucking jewelry.

1283
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,600
I never finished the eyebrows.
I want to give a big tits.

1284
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,760
Push them together.
God.

1285
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,780
Let me try mine.
Come on.

1286
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:40,430
It's my fucking painting.
Yeah,

1287
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:41,530
exactly.
I met,

1288
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,780
we are Devinci is a moderate Italian.
Yeah.

1289
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:44,590
You know I love it.
It's,

1290
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,423
yeah,
it's like

1291
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,690
big tits would fucking glitter.
It's like he's like a living.

1292
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,770
I'm like Mulberry Street and like in
Little Italy.

1293
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,010
Hey Pizza.
Yeah,

1294
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:57,230
I like a fake lips.
It's where I want.

1295
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,350
Give me some claims casino.
Hey,

1296
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:02,540
this fucking broad.
Look at a look at it.

1297
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:07,130
Now,
who is talking about that theory that

1298
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,530
some people believe that Leonardo
Davinci,

1299
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,200
that Mona Lisa was him in drag.
Yeah.

1300
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:14,180
That it was a self portrait.
Who has it?

1301
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,510
That when I was bringing up,
Kalin said that the other day.

1302
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,060
Yeah,
I've seen,

1303
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,380
I've seen those things.
What does it pull up a picture of him

1304
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,660
with this and what we never did.
We only pulled up a picture of the

1305
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:25,820
photo.
We never pulled up a picture of him and

1306
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,530
the photo.
I wonder if that's,

1307
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,270
that's fascinating.
If that really was the case.

1308
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:32,150
If he just decided to paint himself and
drag.

1309
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,560
Well,
they found all kinds of things in that

1310
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,130
painting.
It like in her like,

1311
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,430
like her irs of her eyes.

1312
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,280
There's actually like,
like letters in there and stuff like

1313
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,290
really,
really tiny,

1314
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,340
like straight Illuminati.
Demon comes right out of the ground.

1315
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,710
You know,
I had a dream,

1316
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:51,950
the demons were real last night and I
just remembered it.

1317
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,000
I just had a,
I had a dream where I was stupid amount

1318
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,500
of Steve,
almost 51 years old dreams,

1319
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,060
you know?
Yeah.

1320
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,580
But that's how we fucking thought a
dream the other day where I was the

1321
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:04,520
biggest dick in the world.
Like I was actually just being really

1322
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,530
rude to everybody.
Here's the,

1323
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,970
there's a drawing of him.
Wow.

1324
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,400
It's like looking in a mirror.

1325
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,780
Yeah.
Nailed it guys.

1326
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,380
That's it.
Oh yeah.

1327
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,190
You know,
you can kind of size anything into

1328
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:19,910
anything.
Yeah.

1329
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,280
Well I don't know about that one.
Yeah.

1330
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,690
And the head's a little tall.
Might have gotten confused with that.

1331
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,520
You know,
the drawing of the demand and the circle

1332
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:31,530
in the square and the portraits.
Well,

1333
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,770
you know,
maybe imagined yourself as a woman.

1334
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,800
I mean that's not necessarily him.
And drag.

1335
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,110
Like I,
I've imagined that before.

1336
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:43,610
What would happen if I was born a girl?
What I look like that same.

1337
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,600
I just stare at myself naked in the
mirror every day.

1338
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,640
Look what I got for Ya.
Yeah.

1339
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,310
I dress like a dude just to fuck with
pimple.

1340
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,140
Look at Mike Duties with Michael Angelo.
Um,

1341
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,030
he,
I always used to get them confused.

1342
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,490
Leonardo Da Vinci.
Leonardo Da Vinci was the one that

1343
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,110
invented a bunch of shit though.
Yeah,

1344
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:18,180
he was,
he was the renaissance man.

1345
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:18,690
Yeah,
no,

1346
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,320
he was also kind of an engineer and he
actually made like,

1347
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,640
or at least like,
you know,

1348
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:24,474
like,
uh,

1349
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,510
it was like,
like a tank kind of thing.

1350
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:27,811
Like,
you know,

1351
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,260
like plain plain as well designed.
But he designed,

1352
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,120
uh,
like weapons of war also.

1353
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:36,420
Like it wasn't just like airplanes,
there were at least gliders and

1354
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,520
helicopters and so forth.
Uh,

1355
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,031
but yeah,
no,

1356
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:41,040
he got he,
yeah,

1357
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:44,160
look at all the different shit that he
came up with that just tank.

1358
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,070
Wow.
So when you see the ship and you can see

1359
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:50,760
like there's like kind of like,
like holes for like guns all around and

1360
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:51,560
it's like wheels.

1361
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,680
Like I,
I'm not sure easy.

1362
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,590
I'm not sure if they actually built it
or not.

1363
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,920
That's like a kill everybody tank.
There's so nondescript with where those

1364
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:02,310
bullets are going.
They're going to three 6,360 degree

1365
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,330
spinning that thing around.
But yeah,

1366
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:05,840
no,
he made,

1367
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,251
yeah,
he,

1368
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:08,190
he actually liked designed weapons,
but those,

1369
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,010
those were cannons.
It must've been right.

1370
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,330
Probably that's what it kind of looks
like.

1371
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:17,000
You can have really guns back then
there's in that design and cannons.

1372
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,530
Oh Wow.
That is crazy.

1373
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:20,011
Yeah,
no,

1374
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,240
he was freak.
He was a,

1375
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,640
he was rad man.
Well keep me hanging out with that guy.

1376
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,743
Yeah.
Right.

1377
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:25,930
Just,
you know,

1378
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,570
draw me like one of your French girls.

1379
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,130
How,
how weird the weird guy.

1380
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,230
Yeah,
no.

1381
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,180
Yeah.
Michelangelo,

1382
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,860
the Sistine Chapel and he's actually
more of a sculptor than a painter.

1383
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,810
A a crossbow.
Invented.

1384
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,770
Yeah,
but it's like a giant one looking at.

1385
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,620
Yeah.
Like one of the ones that they killed

1386
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:47,460
the smog with.
Look at the multi gun.

1387
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,620
The Kim was kind of invented a machine
gun,

1388
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:51,120
like the one just left to that.
Yeah,

1389
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,380
it's a bunch of gun barrels.
It's a bunch of gun barrels and it was

1390
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:58,920
like almost like a,
it's like the first design for a machine

1391
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:01,530
gun essentially shoots in multiple
directions.

1392
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:02,350
Looking at,
yeah.

1393
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,920
I,
I would really love to talk to an

1394
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:08,280
extraordinary person from back then.
It must have been so different.

1395
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,630
Hey,
give me some claims casino away.

1396
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,210
Look at this fucking guy.
Look at this airplane thing.

1397
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,890
Yeah.
Like a glider,

1398
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,040
you know,
I like to talk to Picasso or to talk to

1399
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,690
Davinci or any,
any of these people from exceptional

1400
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:25,560
people from a long time.

1401
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,780
It was like my,
my favorite leisure when it comes to his

1402
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:29,110
paintings and stuff.
But you know,

1403
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,520
I,
I heard he wasn't necessarily like,

1404
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:31,340
you know,
the,

1405
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,090
the like coolest person to be around
kind of thing.

1406
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:34,811
You ever seen the,
uh,

1407
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,010
there was like,
what's the deal with him?

1408
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,111
I think he,
I think he,

1409
00:47:37,111 --> 00:47:38,500
he was,
he was an artist.

1410
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:40,740
He was very aware that he was Picasso
lucky.

1411
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:41,340
No.
Like he was,

1412
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,120
yeah.
He was already like the most famous

1413
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,370
painter in the world and he knew it kind
of thing.

1414
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,270
He,
uh,

1415
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,120
he actually used to walk around,
he didn't carry money or a wallet.

1416
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,160
He just carried like a pad.
So if he wanted to get like a,

1417
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,750
a pack of cigarettes,
he kinda just like,

1418
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,910
eh.
And they go in like that.

1419
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,940
So He'd ever had to like pay for
anything because he was shit.

1420
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,260
Yeah.
He kind of say,

1421
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,320
Eh.
And,

1422
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,010
and listen,
would you accept that trade?

1423
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,000
A pack of cigarettes for a Picasso?
Like,

1424
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,160
yeah,
I'd take that trade.

1425
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,230
So are those around?
Yeah,

1426
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,880
he actually has a lot of like little
sketches,

1427
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,620
like all around,
they're actually quite affordable,

1428
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:14,940
at least in terms of owning the Picasso,
the keys,

1429
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,750
you know,
he was very prolific and just like a lot

1430
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:21,190
of like ink drawings and so forth.
I remember there was the snl sketch,

1431
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,500
uh,
it was like love.

1432
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,360
It's was playing Picasso and he's like,
but like he kind of,

1433
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,180
I think it went around kind of just
doing anything he wanted and he's like,

1434
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,340
it's because I'm Picasso,
like,

1435
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,091
you know,
and he was just like,

1436
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:34,000
just being in church.
Everybody you mentioned love.

1437
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:38,080
It's doing that.
You don't love it because I'm PAC caso

1438
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,350
that's a good lump.

1439
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,091
It's impression.
Oh,

1440
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:40,571
thanks.
Thanks.

1441
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:41,404
Yeah,
there you go.

1442
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,830
He was on news radio for a whole season.
Oh yeah,

1443
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:45,030
yeah.
After I have to fill.

1444
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,300
Yeah.
I hung out with him.

1445
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:47,530
He's a good guy.
Yeah.

1446
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:49,810
I've always like every time I bumped,
bumped into him.

1447
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,580
Very,
very nice person.

1448
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:52,540
That really,
really sweet.

1449
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,860
I ran into him at,
um,

1450
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,540
I went to the,
uh,

1451
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,080
with my buddy seth green.
We went to the peewee Herman a Broadway

1452
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:02,200
show that they had a bunch of years back
and yet I ran into love.

1453
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:03,760
It's like they're backstage,
so it's like,

1454
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:04,990
yeah,
just like me,

1455
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,880
Seth Greene,
peewee Herman and Jon Lovitz.

1456
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:07,900
And I'm like,
this is quite a,

1457
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,200
quite a little little get together.
This is,

1458
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,070
this is great.
This is a great table.

1459
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,790
I was doing standup for a while.
I don't think he's doing any more

1460
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,020
because I don't see him anymore.

1461
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,410
But a few years back he was doing a lot
of standup,

1462
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,380
like he was,
he bought,

1463
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,210
he bought the Jon Lovitz Comedy Club.
And universal universal is the worst

1464
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,490
comedy club design of all time.
Well,

1465
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:31,324
you know,
it's,

1466
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,240
it's weird that he was actually able to
find a club that was already named after

1467
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:35,310
him.
He wouldn't,

1468
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,131
what are the,
what are the odds?

1469
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:38,530
He bought a place.
It used to be the house of Blues.

1470
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:39,221
It was,
no,

1471
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:42,040
it was bb King's club.
It was bb King's Blues Club.

1472
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,590
And he turns it into the John Lovitz
thing.

1473
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,560
And um,
he was,

1474
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,720
wow.
That's really interesting.

1475
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:54,490
I'm remembering that I saw Sean Penn had
that older brother,

1476
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:58,900
that big brother that died crispin.
I saw that guy there,

1477
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,120
play the harmonica,
hammered one onstage and play the

1478
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:05,890
harmonica and hey,
I'm Chris Ben.

1479
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,990
That was some weird Hollywood thing.
And I was like,

1480
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:09,760
wow,
imagine that you're so famous.

1481
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,600
You just jump on stage at a blues club
and play the harmonica and everybody's

1482
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:14,570
happier.
They're like,

1483
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,250
oh,
weird.

1484
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,340
Yeah.
But uh,

1485
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:19,120
I was hoping it was gonna be like Sean
Penn jumped up there and did like his

1486
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:20,550
tight five.
But you would be on,

1487
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,950
that would be strange.
John Mayer does stand up.

1488
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,750
I've heard that.
Very strange.

1489
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,220
So if you're on stage bb King's

1490
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,690
place,
like if this was a stage,

1491
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,440
there would be a balcony,
but it would be above you like way up

1492
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:36,590
there right above you.
And so like you'd have to look up to see

1493
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:38,450
the people that are white.
So they're basically looking straight

1494
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:42,010
down on the top of your head.
Worst idea for design,

1495
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,160
but it's not as serious when you're
seeing music,

1496
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,710
you know,
you don't necessarily have to be as

1497
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:50,600
connected to the person's face.
I've been to,

1498
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:54,410
I've been to a place where actually like
you were literally right over the band

1499
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,730
and that was kind of neat.
Like actually watching,

1500
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,440
watching the drummer from overhead,
like kind of,

1501
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:58,700
it's kind of neat.
But yeah,

1502
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,770
no,
just like just watching somebody with a

1503
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:03,980
bald spot on the top of their head.
And that's really close.

1504
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,540
Yeah.
And there's Lebanese and hey look at me.

1505
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,150
And they gave me pain,
fanny and down clapping.

1506
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,380
I'm back.
I sell.

1507
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,730
I imagined it was taller than that.
That's interesting.

1508
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,290
My memory's not that good.
Yeah.

1509
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,223
Yeah.
Getting whole day.

1510
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,193
Yes.
Yes.

1511
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:26,060
Well it's just getting weird because
it's got too much shit in there.

1512
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,610
My brain has too much information.
So you're running that a room?

1513
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,660
Oh,
for sure.

1514
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,120
I'm a deleting space on my hard drive
for new thing.

1515
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,670
Yeah.
And like seventh grade I went to seventh

1516
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:36,140
grade done cheese.
Oh God.

1517
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,780
What happened to that seventh grade?
Funny that you know who needs curse if

1518
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,000
am I right?
I wonder what John's doing.

1519
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,800
I'm one.
I wonder why he stopped doing standup

1520
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,050
because he was actually pretty funny and
he was,

1521
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:52,430
it was weird because he was already
famous and one of the things was like I,

1522
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,780
I had tried to encourage Phil Hartman to
do stand up several times because he

1523
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,480
would do standup where he would warm up
for the,

1524
00:51:59,510 --> 00:51:59,931
you know,
the,

1525
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:01,610
the crowd would be there for the show.

1526
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,480
And in between scenes,
there was always some downtime and Phil

1527
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,880
would take the warmups microphone and do
bitch riff,

1528
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,500
do like his Bill Clinton impression.
This was during the whole Monica

1529
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,530
Lewinsky scandal.
So he had like all this material about

1530
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:18,890
Bill Clinton and Monica and his
impressions were amazing.

1531
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,401
Yeah,
yeah.

1532
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:20,121
No,
he's like,

1533
00:52:20,121 --> 00:52:22,460
he's one of my favorites of all time on
that show.

1534
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,840
Yeah,
he was amazing.

1535
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,470
And so he was thinking about what does
this two shows a night?

1536
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,410
Where is he?
Huntsville,

1537
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:33,330
Alabama,
still doing stand up.

1538
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,790
Look at that.
He didn't give a fuck.

1539
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,250
Look at them out there with those
glasses is great.

1540
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,410
Hey,
he looks happy.

1541
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:42,150
He looks at 14 likes.
Hey,

1542
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:48,530
I'm Jon Lovitz
looking on my legs.

1543
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,900
Yeah.
So he's still doing it.

1544
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,040
Interesting.
Good for him.

1545
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,140
Good for him.
Like I said,

1546
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:54,810
I always liked him.
Great Guy.

1547
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,800
When I did SNL,
I think it was the first season where he

1548
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:58,970
had,
he had just left.

1549
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,710
I think because I did it pretty much
probably if I had to pick a season,

1550
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,510
I would have been,
would have been that when I did.

1551
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,670
Because you still had carvey and you
still had,

1552
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:09,740
you know,
Hartman and Victoria Jackson,

1553
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:12,980
like the whole kind of group,
but I forgot him of Victoria Jackson.

1554
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,200
She was fucking hilarious.
Yeah.

1555
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,200
What happened to her?
She's a hardcore conservative now.

1556
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,350
Huge like right,
right winger.

1557
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,640
She's put on a little weight,
you know,

1558
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:24,850
but I haven't wheel and uh,
yeah,

1559
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,840
no,
she's actually a hardcore conservative

1560
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,711
now.
Like she,

1561
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:33,711
she shouted from the mountaintops,
what was she like when you met her?

1562
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,090
She was fine.
I mean listen,

1563
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,650
it was she conservative.
I was,

1564
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,240
I was busy doing the show kind of thing,
you know what I mean?

1565
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,650
Cause it's a lot of work and mature now.
He,

1566
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,330
that I had to do a,
um,

1567
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,260
I had to do it without cue cards cause
my father didn't want me to use cue

1568
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:46,680
cards.

1569
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,840
So I don't like to memorize all that
stuff.

1570
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,140
Plus plus plus the skits that didn't
even make it into the show.

1571
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,970
So I like,
I had to memorize like schizo didn't

1572
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:55,580
even end up in the sheets.
Yeah.

1573
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:57,640
Dad,
you know,

1574
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,150
like I said,
I had a good memory and he didn't want

1575
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:01,140
me reading.
You know,

1576
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,280
cause it,
you can see it,

1577
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,070
they can see it when people are reading.
And he didn't want me to do in that,

1578
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:05,800
so.
Wow.

1579
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,480
So Nokia card,
but also that means the other actors do

1580
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:10,710
cue card for them either.
Yeah,

1581
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:11,850
of course not.
You know,

1582
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:12,991
they had like,
yeah,

1583
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,270
no,
I'm sure my father made a lot of friends

1584
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:16,104
looking at him.
Like,

1585
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,910
you know,
that that weekend,

1586
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,630
well that's fucked up.
Like how can he dictate whether or not

1587
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:24,390
the other actors get cue cards?
I don't know.

1588
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,200
Cause it's
because he apparently he could.

1589
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,320
Victoria Jackson's a hardcore
conservative,

1590
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,460
so straight,
like I said,

1591
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,480
she shouted from the mountaintops and
again,

1592
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,380
active.
Yeah.

1593
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,410
So she was like,
you know,

1594
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:39,720
so it was that whole kind of group,
that kind of late eighties group.

1595
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,070
Uh,
but then also it was a,

1596
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,650
it was mick Meyer a second season,
I think,

1597
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,510
you know,
it was in,

1598
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,210
it was like,
you know,

1599
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,020
Schneider Sandler,
Chris Rock,

1600
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:49,860
you know,
so it was like that kind of overlap

1601
00:54:49,861 --> 00:54:51,510
year.
So I actually got like a really kind of

1602
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:54,480
like really good group that lingo.
So that was awesome.

1603
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,390
That was neat.
It's always weird when someone from like

1604
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:00,760
a TV show gets really political.
Yeah.

1605
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,190
You know,
like,

1606
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:07,080
like a chuck woolery from the love that
guy is,

1607
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,630
he's so fucking crazy conservative.
Oh really?

1608
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,300
Yeah,
his twitter feed.

1609
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:15,690
I go to his twitter feed every now and
then just to see what crazy old men

1610
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:17,250
conservatives are really interested in.

1611
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,770
How often does he use the term fake
news?

1612
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:23,400
You know,
the libs and got dems,

1613
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,370
the Dems and the libs.
They outright,

1614
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,500
you know,
he's kept,

1615
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:31,920
apparently he's got a like a radio show,
like some like uh,

1616
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,310
like all what we make sense and it's one
of those things,

1617
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,420
you know,
you know,

1618
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,250

You Damn Liberals.
It's kind of more like,

1622
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:46,440
kind of like it.
That sounds like a band from Brooklyn.

1623
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,800
Look at it.
Three d printed farms are a concern for

1624
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:52,170
crime,
but criminals will do bad things no

1625
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:54,640
matter what.
Find out more by listening.

1626
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:56,940
End Up Blunt force truth.
Look at that.

1627
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,330
It's Hashtag bft wow.
He's a,

1628
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,040
he's pushing that and I said,
listen to some of that just for he,

1629
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:03,830
he isn't.
Haha.

1630
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:04,261
Yeah,
I know,

1631
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,750
right?
You should all show follow James Woods.

1632
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,070
Oh,
goodness.

1633
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,520
Yes.
It says it right there.

1634
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,390
Right?
You like this look like that.

1635
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,380
All dudes do you want to put up giant
gates

1636
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,420
so they're going to get solar to what
happened?

1637
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,280
What happened after Peter Fonda?
He's super conservative to now,

1638
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,480
isn't he?
I don't know.

1639
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:28,240
They're just democrats to commit voter
fraud.

1640
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,390
Oh,
the opposite.

1641
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,360
It's the opposite.
Yeah.

1642
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,070
He's a super,
Super Democrat.

1643
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,790
Rosie turns feud with trump into
activism.

1644
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:41,470
Bitter rosy.
All caps.

1645
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,600
Trump rallies are real.
His supporters are paid black forest

1646
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:47,730
truth,
truth.

1647
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,400
True.
Just look at you.

1648
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,320
Oh,
look at that.

1649
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,320
Some journalistic integrity from chuck
woolery.

1650
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:56,710
That's his whole thing though.
His whole thing is that now I think he

1651
00:56:56,711 --> 00:57:00,070
lives in Texas or something.
I think he escape California and all the

1652
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:02,710
crazy libs.
That'll be right back in two and two,

1653
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,650
two and two.
I forget the name of that show.

1654
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:06,490
I remember.
I used to like it.

1655
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:07,910
That went on the game show network.
Don't want that.

1656
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,240
All the boxes and it was like letters
and stuff.

1657
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,171
Uh,
fuck.

1658
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:12,800
I forget the name of it.
Uh,

1659
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,300
what's that?
So many shows.

1660
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,430
Yes.
Yeah.

1661
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:20,140
I only remember the love connection.
I add like 10 maybe.

1662
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,060
Yeah,
the game show network.

1663
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:24,100
Yeah.
Like when that launched and they're

1664
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:24,401
like,
yeah,

1665
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:25,720
we can get,
we can get chuck woolery.

1666
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,980
So
I'll go on if you'll let me talk about

1667
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:31,270
the damn libs.
Yeah,

1668
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,990
exactly.
TRIBEC and was busy like,

1669
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:36,280
you know,
he's already busy on his own thing,

1670
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:41,281
but we can get woolery how weird and
what was the guy scrabble or lingo too.

1729
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:47,120
Look at Chuck Upfront when we were at

1730
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,580
two and two.

1731
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:52,040
wooden beads around his neck to both do
like,

1732
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:53,510

1733
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:54,940

Feel like I'm at a party,

1734
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,620
like on Haight Ashbury or something like
that.

1735
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:58,880
And then you know,
I want to fun late sixties the guy in

1736
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:01,640
the back with his hand on his hip.
See what the fuck he's up to these days.

1737
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,770
That is the other guy that's pet say
jack

1738
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:11,660
honey and gall like what is that?
I think it's the name of the album.

1739
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,780
Oh,
that's the name of the album.

1740
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,610
I don't know actually.
I know it's probably the byside elk in

1741
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:21,560
Bubba Fowler Elkins got a duck hunting
show on the sportsmans channel.

1742
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:26,561
Now this guy
I'm getting,

1743
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,550
what is he doing now?
He's a Leonard Cohen.

1744
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,163
Leonard Cohen.

1745
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:36,060
The [inaudible] yard.
How strange it is.

1746
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:39,920
I think blunt force truth is a better
name for a band and the avant garde.

1747
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,421
Yeah,
it is,

1748
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:42,060
right?
Yeah.

1749
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,590
Tonight at the pit blunt force truth,
you don't want to know the truth

1750
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,180
phenomena.
It's blunt,

1751
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,160
blunt force.
What a weird name for a show.

1752
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,940
Blunt force truth,
spitting hot truth right in your face.

1753
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,360
Just spitting it.
Spit,

1754
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,290
not fire that you don't want to hear
shit.

1755
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,970
Hot Fire.
Wake up kids.

1756
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,990
I always looked at it.
I always loved that line from a

1757
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:04,700
Chappelle.
It was like,

1758
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:04,941

1759
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:07,700
you know,
I spent hot fire and it's just like I

1760
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,840
said,
if there's cold buyer,

1761
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,670
I'm spending hot fire.
Right.

1762
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:14,830
And you're cold fusion.
What else?

1763
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:18,410
That's so strange that that whole thing
that he's,

1764
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:19,890
he was in a,
Yup.

1765
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,870
The avant garde to,

1766
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:26,190

1771
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,220
Yeah,
he definitely has a nice voice.

1772
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,210
It's like a bad voice.

1773
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:53,880
Hmm.
Oh yeah.

1774

01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,590
Exactly.
Yes,

1822
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,970
yes.
The presenter.

1823
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,140
That song actually gave them,
there was so,

1824
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:41,220
so much of a hit that they were a one
hit wonder then and he had to become a

1825
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:43,590
truck driver to simple bent supplement
his income.

1826
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:48,390
He then signed on as a solo artist,
had five more songs on his own.

1827
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,500
Didn't obviously work out that well.
Then he became the first dose of wheel

1828
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:53,940
of fortune and 1970 [inaudible].

1829
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:54,913
Oh,
I didn't

1830
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:01,250
say Jack's been doing it since 1981 I
love that.

1831
01:05:01,251 --> 01:05:02,990
That's great.
So how long did he do it for?

1832
01:05:02,991 --> 01:05:03,651
Six years.
Five,

1833
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:05,600
six years.
Wheel of fortune for six years.

1834
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:10,040
What year did it start?
75 so it was a year after that.

1835
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,350
After that thing.
We just watched.

1836
01:05:11,351 --> 01:05:12,860
So it was it one year later,
six years.

1837
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,840
I hope he still had that hair,
that mane of hair.

1838
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,810
He still does a thing.
Yeah.

1839
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,820
Those,
there's little like the sideburns,

1840
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,220
the mutton chops.
No Man.

1841
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,710
Old School ones go down to your job.
Mallory Dispute

1842
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,180
Chuck and then didn't get to go straight
to say Jack.

1843
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,670
Imagine he fucking turns it on.
It's still on the air.

1844
01:05:30,671 --> 01:05:35,671
He's like
my age.

1845
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,700
It's a piece of shit.
That's the blunt force truth you want

1846
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,534
out of the blackboard.

1847
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,980
I have regrets.
That's the truth.

1848
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,970
Maybe he didn't want to do it anymore.
Maybe that's what it was.

1849
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:50,350
Contract negotiations went straight into
like the dating game or whatever.

1850
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,210
Show get to see chicks,
I guess.

1851
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:54,970
So they're trying to get laid.
So did you got it?

1852
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:58,810
You got chicks and dude's trying to get
laid or facilitator putting love

1853
01:05:58,811 --> 01:05:59,621
together.
I mean,

1854
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:03,550
you know who got the most action was a
Richard Dawson family feud.

1855
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,690
Oh yeah.
He always kissed every like lady on

1856
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,750
don't even like the ones that were
underage.

1857
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,830
Did you ever see that movie with the
thing is speech.

1858
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:15,640
See gonna Richard Dawson,
the guy who was in Hogan's heroes with

1859
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:17,500
him.
What was that fucking movie?

1860
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,780
Oh,
like

1861
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,400
eight or eight millimeter.
One of those.

1862
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:28,690
It's not that the movie where who?
What was that guy's name?

1863
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:32,080
I don't know.
He was apparently he was the guy who was

1864
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:35,260
the star of Hogan's heroes and then he
just became the freak of the week.

1865
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,030
He just got homemade porno.
That's all he did.

1866
01:06:39,031 --> 01:06:44,031
That's all he did,
and then they think the guy he did porn

1867
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:47,980
with killed him.
I believe his murder was never saw,

1868
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,340
but there was some sort of extenuating
circumstances that connected his,

1869
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:57,520
his porn buddy.
The guy was in the movie.

1870
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,980
I think they maybe that was what they
implied in the movie.

1871
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,600
I think that was what it was.
Well,

1872
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:02,950
if it was in a movie,
it has to be true.

1873
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,170
You know it.
They don't ever lie.

1874
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:06,160
Man.
Crime.

1875
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,740
That's the thing about movies.
When they do a story about your life,

1876
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:10,510
they don't change shit.
No.

1877
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:14,920
They literally get every word right.
Otherwise they would lose credibility.

1878
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,203
Yup.
Yup.

1879
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,710
Yeah,
yeah.

1880
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:19,800
There's,
there's movies where they change shit.

1881
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,430
You're like,
why did you change that?

1882
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,220
Like they just decide to like his
historical things like,

1883
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,260
oh it's creative license or like we have
to condense things because a person's

1884
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:30,510
life is like,
you know,

1885
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,470
so long and things like that.

1886
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,950
Do you remember that movie about um,
the,

1887
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,590
the movie with,
uh,

1888
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,470
it was with,
um,

1889
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,560
what's his name from the office?
Yes.

1890
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:46,210
Steve Carell.
He played that catch her.

1891
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,010
Yeah.
We were both thinking the same thing.

1892
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,270
I was just waiting to get the
description cause I was going to say

1893
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,400
foxcatcher he's back.
No,

1894
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,740
not that,
that movie's based on two very famous

1895
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:56,440
wrestlers,
Dave Schultz and Marshall and in the

1896
01:07:56,441 --> 01:08:01,441
movie they put a ton of bullshit in
there and don't mean a lot of in mark

1897
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:04,410
was furious when the movie came out.
I remember reading that and he,

1898
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,730
you know,
he went on a crazy wild twitter storm.

1899
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:09,220
But then after that,
like the end of the movie,

1900
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,440
He,
there's a historic moment in that,

1901
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,680
in that movie that they just completely
made up.

1902
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,050
Like he fought this guy named big daddy
goodrich in the UFC.

1903
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,800
I mean it's,
it's sports history and in terms of the,

1904
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,150
it sounds like that sounds like a wwe
wrestler.

1905
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,480
I know it does.
Could have been a wwe wrestler,

1906
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:29,080
but a big daddy goodrich who's,
you know,

1907
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:32,140
really a pioneer in mma fighting,
um,

1908
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:36,850
was this big fucking Jack Black Guy who
wore a,

1909
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:39,470
a gay,
he wore like a traditional karate

1910
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:43,910
getting into the octagon in the movie.
They have him fighting a white guy,

1911
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,710
a Russian guy,
whitewash.

1912
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:49,040
And they just decided they don't want to
see why guys.

1913
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:49,610
Yeah,
no,

1914
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:51,380
I'm going to put her wasn't as America
we have,

1915
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,730
we have to fight.
The Russians was like,

1916
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:57,080
why would you change the race and the
name of the guy he fought?

1917
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,600
Yeah.
Just seems like weird and like petty

1918
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:03,590
almost till you know what?
It's this weird greasy producers who

1919
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,360
think they're smart.
You've been around them,

1920
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:07,220
you know those fucks.
I have no idea what you're talking

1921
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:07,630
about.
Tell,

1922
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:08,960
tell him.
Let me tell you,

1923
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,720
I'm going to give you the blunt force
truth right in your face.

1924
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,553
Sit Hot.
Fire

1925
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:18,110
fucking lips.
They,

1926
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:18,770
uh,
they,

1927
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,690
you know,
they just decide they're smarter than

1928
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:23,840
everybody and they know better.
They know how to change history and make

1929
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:25,010
it,
make it a better show.

1930
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,031
And like I said,
well,

1931
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:26,631
you know,
we were,

1932
01:09:26,631 --> 01:09:28,160
it was the eighties so look,
yes,

1933
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:30,050
it has to be against a Russian kind of
thing.

1934
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:31,970
Wasn't the 80s well,
I'm saying it takes place,

1935
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:33,800
isn't it the case?
Please note takers in the 90s.

1936
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,630
Yeah,
it was a,

1937
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:39,560
I think he fought in 1995 or say no Kurt
Angle,

1938
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:41,340
like I know a trained,
uh,

1939
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:43,340
in that facility,
the Fox catcher.

1940
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,010
Yeah,
he's talked about that.

1941
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:50,040
You know how crazy that guy was just
decided to set up some wrestling thing

1942
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:51,770
so you could get like weird with these
dudes,

1943
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:57,080
like a bunch of strong sweaty men like
rubbing up against each other.

1944
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,200
It's,
I bet you those red lose like wrestlers,

1945
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:02,720
like when they're training,
I bet you whoever their training with

1946
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,120
knows their body better than their
wives.

1947
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,400
No,
it's a really intimate thing.

1948
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,791
I mean,
like,

1949
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:12,791
I bet you they know every curve of their
trainee losing weight here at Tom.

1950
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:13,820
Yeah,
exactly.

1951
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:17,840
I'm going to cinch this grip around.
Your waist just feels like a little

1952
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:18,630
easier.
No,

1953
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,650
I,
it is intimate sport.

1954
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:25,340
We're not some shoulder muscle
weight a little.

1955
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:26,091
So all that,
you know,

1956
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:30,870
say I had a gun and your baton.
Yeah,

1957
01:10:30,871 --> 01:10:34,700
I remember when he was like in the movie
Steve Carell was so good in that movie.

1958
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:38,090
I loved him and that God,
he played that creep so well because he

1959
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:41,690
played it like a guy who's like a loose
cannon,

1960
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:43,530
like creepy,
weird and loose cannon,

1961
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:45,500
small,
you know the way he kind of like his

1962
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:47,570
movements and his speech.
It was good.

1963
01:10:47,571 --> 01:10:49,880
It was good.
I remember when he was like,

1964
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:54,290
he decided he was going to coach and
coach the wrestlers and show them how to

1965
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:57,000
do certain moves and everybody just sort
of tolerated.

1966
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:59,540
Then they're kind of like,
oh let them and let them have this one

1967
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:02,030
strain.
But what a great scene.

1968
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:06,320
But here's the thing like that,
that scene was so good,

1969
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,530
but now I know you lied at the end.
So I know you lied to the end of the

1970
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,310
movie.
So now I go,

1971
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:12,200
well,
did you make up that scene starts losing

1972
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,700
credibility.
I did watch it.

1973
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:14,070
I did watch

1974
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,450
a doc about that.
I think there's a 30 for 30 about the

1975
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,860
Fox catcher institute or whatever it
was.

1976
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:23,370
There was a lot of footage on that guy
and Corel fucking nailed it.

1977
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:24,660
Dupont,
dupont,

1978
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:25,980
dupont.
Yeah.

1979
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:26,761
Yeah.
Yeah.

1980
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:28,350
What a strange,
strange guy.

1981
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:33,351
That guy was mister dupont.
That's a unfortunate thing about those

1982
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:36,420
wrestlers.
Like there's no real professional venue

1983
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,460
other than fighting if they want to go
into mma.

1984
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,930
And he was a coach at Brigham Young.
Mark Schultz was and he just,

1985
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,840
he fought one time in the UFC and then
just stayed.

1986
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:47,790
They,
I don't think they wanted him doing it.

1987
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:51,750
I think that was part of the dispute is
that his coach believe it was Brigham

1988
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,301
Young,
his,

1989
01:11:52,301 --> 01:11:54,000
uh,
the school that he was coaching for,

1990
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:54,810
it was like,
listen,

1991
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,510
you want a coach here?
He can't be cage fight.

1992
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:59,970
Cause especially like early,
like MMA was not respected at all.

1993
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,860
I remember John Mccain trying to let you
know,

1994
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:03,720
again,
like it was a blood sport and he kept

1995
01:12:03,721 --> 01:12:04,890
on,
you know what that was about?

1996
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,210
That was about Budweiser because
budweiser sponsored boxing and MMA was

1997
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,520
doing very well with paper view back
then and they wanted to uh,

1998
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:17,220
stop it in its tracks and budweiser was
a big part of that.

1999
01:12:17,221 --> 01:12:20,400
And Budweiser sort of got behind him.
It's all greasy.

2000
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,650
Yeah.
I mean the boxing world is so Greece

2001
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,690
cause I'm a fight fan at least like
boxing.

2002
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:26,430
I was kind of like,
we're always kind of raised that way.

2003
01:12:26,431 --> 01:12:28,470
Like I do follow it.
Um,

2004
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,600
uh,
I've only recently kind of gotten into

2005
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:34,440
like the Nma and kind of stuff.
I've gone to some shows they're going to

2006
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:37,710
see any sporting event is always great
life looking at do you go to live boxing

2007
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:39,380
matches though?
Having been a while.

2008
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,020
Uh,
but yeah,

2009
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,250
I like I especially,
I used to,

2010
01:12:41,251 --> 01:12:42,001
like,
I used to go to like I,

2011
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:44,740
I saw a holyfield more or one digit
really.

2012
01:12:44,741 --> 01:12:48,720
I saw a holyfield bow one,
things like that,

2013
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:48,991
like,
yeah,

2014
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:50,520
during that kind of peak,
you know?

2015
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:53,340
Yeah.
That was that nineties era did it,

2016
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:55,230
did a lot of those.
Um,

2017
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,420
but uh,
those were great,

2018
01:12:57,421 --> 01:12:59,670
but that stuff is so greasy,
you know.

2019
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:00,990
I remember the first,
uh,

2020
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,230
Holyfield Louis like that,
how that ended in a draw so they could

2021
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,170
double up their money and stuff.
Remember that fight?

2022
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,420
I don't remember how we feel versus
Louis at all.

2023
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,450
Yeah.
They fought twice Louis when the first

2024
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:14,910
time no draw one draw the push shitty of
one.

2025
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,930
Yeah,
yeah,

2026
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:17,020
yeah.
You know,

2027
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,510
I was,
it was,

2028
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:21,390
it was a great boxer,
but at the same time I just remember

2029
01:13:21,391 --> 01:13:22,440
being driven nuts.

2030
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:23,670
Like where he was like,
wait,

2031
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,390
where is like belt like up to here?
Like it was like way past his belly

2032
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:29,130
button and he's 48.
He's already like six,

2033
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:31,380
six already.
And it's kind of just like,

2034
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:32,214
yeah,
like he's,

2035
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,780
he's wearing that thing too high.
Like,

2036
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:35,430
you know,
like he's getting away with murder like

2037
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,410
you,
what kind of thing it shouldn't,

2038
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:37,981
you know?
Yeah,

2039
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,500
absolutely.
I'm surprised you've got away with that,

2040
01:13:39,501 --> 01:13:40,830
you know,
that that equipment,

2041
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,250
but both,
most referees will tell you you can hit

2042
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:44,400
him here.
Yeah.

2043
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,110
But you know,
like I said,

2044
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:48,120
it was kind of just,
it felt like an unfair advantage,

2045
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:50,640
especially for a guy who was like,
like I said,

2046
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:52,560
six,
six getting at and so ready.

2047
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,394
Enormous.
Yeah,

2048
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,211
exactly.
Like,

2049
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:54,600
you know,
he's,

2050
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,040
so,
it's even higher than normal and that

2051
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:58,710
would be a big target for somebody who's
like only like casino.

2052
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:01,040
So you follow boxing today though?
Yeah,

2053
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,930
I'm really looking forward.
You know,

2054
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,920
I want to see wilder versus a Joshua
look,

2055
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:07,960
that's when I want to see in the
heavyweight division for a while tasting

2056
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,970
fury though.
Like he's kind of back in the ring and

2057
01:14:09,971 --> 01:14:12,160
the ties fewer in my them all up.
That's

2058
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,460
a problem because they're all big guys.
They are big guys.

2059
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:19,570
But Tyson fury looks fucking fantastic.
There's some footage on his instagram of

2060
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:22,960
him doing pad work and he's fighting
really soon.

2061
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:25,360
He just bought like a warm up kind of
like,

2062
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,530
you know,
some journeyman.

2063
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,700
But it's got about coming up.
Uh,

2064
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,090
well Tyson does.
I think,

2065
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:33,970
I think it just happened like air or
something or does he have another one

2066
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:34,804
coming?
I think he's got it.

2067
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:37,540
I'm pretty sure he's got another one.
I'm a big deontay wilder fan.

2068
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,530
I am too.
Yeah,

2069
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,180
like it's just,
it's wild man.

2070
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:44,350
Unorthodox and like man,
the way he fucking slugs the Jesus

2071
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,520
Christ,
which is vicious power.

2072
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,500
Oh yeah.
I'm watching those highlight reels and

2073
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:48,071
just like,
yeah,

2074
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:50,800
like I mean it's give that guy a
seizure.

2075
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,110
There was that one where the boom,
the guy land scene just like,

2076
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:55,720
it's like a flapping around like a fish
and it's like Jesus Christ,

2077
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,610
he has fucking hard because he's like
six [inaudible] seven.

2078
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,710
He's a big dude.
He is long too.

2079
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,460
Like crazy leverage.
Get those.

2080
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:03,100
He was,
cause he really snapped his right

2081
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,050
looking at boom,
the recent one.

2082
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:05,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

2083
01:15:05,921 --> 01:15:09,520
That was back from like was losing that
fight and then stopped or tea.

2084
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:10,990
I thought it showed up like,
yeah,

2085
01:15:10,991 --> 01:15:14,920
it showed that he's got like he's got
heart and he's got a pretty okay chin.

2086
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:18,160
He knows how to recover.
Who's your favorite fighter to watch

2087
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,210
right now?
One?

2088
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,320
Yeah.
Like I said,

2089
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:22,870
I really do love watching wilder.
Like right now.

2090
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:24,910
Triple g's good.
Yeah.

2091
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:26,371
Yeah.
He's,

2092
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:26,980
he's,
he's,

2093
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,620
he's looking at it like he's might be
like an old timer kind of thing.

2094
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,410
I just wish he'd kind of look how good
this guy looks.

2095
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,600
Six foot nine,
give me some volume on this.

2096
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:36,220
I can hear this.
And he's thick too,

2097
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:41,170
but he's,
he's like showing how slick he is cause

2098
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:43,120
he's,
he's not just big.

2099
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:46,100
He's big and long,
but here it's here.

2100
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:49,650
He told me,
he told me he toys.

2101
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,070
He toyed with Klitschko.
Yeah,

2102
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:52,270
man.
Dude,

2103
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:56,080
he's fucking good.
And he gives people fits yet the new

2104
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:58,180
rumors is supposed to be wilder versus
fury.

2105
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:01,240
Now the Joshua like talks,
I'm like not happening.

2106
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:02,980
Well yeah.
Um,

2107
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,580
Tyson fury.
He could fuck up that whole thing then.

2108
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:10,030
So it's the 18th of August and they're
both a little unorthodox too.

2109
01:16:10,031 --> 01:16:12,460
So it'd be actually interesting to see
like him square off with wilder.

2110
01:16:12,461 --> 01:16:14,920
Fuck yeah,
they're both super long.

2111
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,750
Yeah,
that would be very interesting.

2112
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:19,150
But I think it would be like the first
time who others finding somebody who's

2113
01:16:19,151 --> 01:16:22,000
bigger than him do not just bigger but
super slick.

2114
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:23,410
He's going to give him fits.
Yup.

2115
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,420
Yup.
I mean look,

2116
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,370
wilder can knock out anybody but Tyson
fury he,

2117
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,700
he'll give you fits like that guys.

2118
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:33,630
Cause Wilder is like what?
Like 37 and hoe with 36 knockouts things

2119
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,770
once.
I know it's crazy.

2120
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,430
That's a crazy record.
Yup.

2121
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:41,050
It's tasting esque like young Tyson has
but then they're completely different

2122
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:43,960
fighters.
Young Tyson was just so tight and like,

2123
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:46,000
you know like and wilders,
he puts his hands down,

2124
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,590
he wants to counter punch like you know,
that's his whole thing.

2125
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:50,460
What's interesting is people still don't
believe in,

2126
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:52,510
I'm like,
I had heard that the Anthony Joshua

2127
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:54,070
fight.
Like I would think that that would be

2128
01:16:54,071 --> 01:16:56,590
like a pretty evenly matched fight that
people are like,

2129
01:16:56,591 --> 01:16:57,424
no,
no gosh,

2130
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,030
it was heads up,
heads above everybody else.

2131
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:00,970
It's like,
you know,

2132
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:02,020
I'm not so sure.
Look,

2133
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:04,420
you know,
you take it on some good challenges

2134
01:17:04,421 --> 01:17:05,740
though.
I mean like Joshua can go,

2135
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,930
we can do some amazing,
don't get me wrong,

2136
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,370
but he got knocked down by Klitschko
Tyson

2137
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:15,370
fury toward with Klitschko putting his
hands behind his back and maybe it was

2138
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:18,950
not the same as prepared a Klitschko.
You know,

2139
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:21,110
fighters are different for every fight,
which goes like,

2140
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:23,000
yeah,
like aging obviously.

2141
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:24,350
Yes.
At that point.

2142
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,110
Yeah.
But I just think that that style,

2143
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:29,060
that Tyson fury style,
avoid that shit.

2144
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,350
Like measles get away.
Yeah.

2145
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,900
There's a reason why Joshua doesn't want
to fight wilder or fury.

2146
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:37,550
Yeah.
Cause also he is the top draw right now.

2147
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:38,980
Like he can sell out like,
you know,

2148
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:42,410
like 40 50,000 in his home country where
it's like wilder,

2149
01:17:42,411 --> 01:17:43,380
like in his home state,
he's,

2150
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,340
he fights a lot in Alabama.
Like it's like 10,000 or something like

2151
01:17:46,341 --> 01:17:48,260
that.
So Joshua was a bigger draw.

2152
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,810
Well he's becoming,
I think while there is becoming a bigger

2153
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:55,220
draw nationally now,
but I think that's also one of the

2154
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:56,060
things with boxing.

2155
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,440
He's like,
they're always trying to figure out

2156
01:17:57,441 --> 01:17:59,090
like,
when do we make this fight?

2157
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,640
Do we make it now or do we wait a couple
of months?

2158
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:04,060
Let me see.
The year undefeated champions find each

2159
01:18:04,061 --> 01:18:05,210
other.
Like that doesn't really happen that

2160
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:07,040
often,
especially in the heavyweight division.

2161
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,200
It could be like something that's like
really special.

2162
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,390
Someone could fuck up and lose.
Yeah,

2163
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,800
exactly.
Exactly.

2164
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,090
It made me whether Pacquiao all over
again where it's like it happened,

2165
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:18,280
but it happened too late.
Right,

2166
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:19,880
exactly.
Yeah.

2167
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:22,790
So it get stay the fuck away from Tyson
fury kids.

2168
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:26,150
What'd you think about the uh,
the Mcgregor Mayweather fight?

2169
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,330
It went,
he did much better than I thought he was

2170
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:30,420
going to get me to.
Um,

2171
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,940
but I think that may,
whether it was probably wanting to wear

2172
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:39,290
him out and so allowed him to explain,
but he did catch me whether with a very

2173
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:42,610
clean left was rabbit punching the whole
time that was driving me insane.

2174
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:44,600
Just kept on just punching the back of
his head.

2175
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:45,331
Like,
you don't like them.

2176
01:18:45,331 --> 01:18:47,270
I'm surprised that the left hand
hammered.

2177
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,700
Exactly.
It's like,

2178
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:49,760
man,
you can't do that.

2179
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:51,320
Look at me.
And I'm surprised like the ref,

2180
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:52,880
like let them get away with murder.
But

2181
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:58,100
I think you wanted to frustrate me her
and get me whether to try to stay open

2182
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:00,680
up.
Maybe whether it's defense is like

2183
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:02,100
fantastic and like,
no,

2184
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,400
he came in there like mayweather fought
a perfect kind of fight.

2185
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,000
He's like,
just,

2186
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,350
I'm going to let this guy get himself
out.

2187
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,530
And that's exactly what he did.
Well because we were going to knock

2188
01:19:08,531 --> 01:19:09,920
knockout artist,
but he knocked him out.

2189
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:13,100
He definitely stopped him.
But Connor is not known for his cardio.

2190
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:13,480
He's,
yeah,

2191
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,070
he's a fast twitch guy.
Yeah,

2192
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,680
I think it was when they opened up the
books for that fight,

2193
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,260
uh,
it was a thousand to one from Mcgregor

2194
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:22,280
to win by decision.

2195
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,590
I listen to,
I almost,

2196
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:26,300
I almost put a grand on that just
anyway,

2197
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:29,380
just on principle just to see like,
wow,

2198
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,660
I just want,
I just want,

2199
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:36,160
I just want $1 million.
There's a reason why no one.

2200
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,970
But I kinda wanna just sit there and
like turn to my friends.

2201
01:19:37,971 --> 01:19:40,430
Like I think I just won $1 million
crazy.

2202
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:42,530
That would be to win $1 million.
We're putting dots,

2203
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,730
I guess that was in del,
I bet

2204
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,750
there's been some crazy,
but those,

2205
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,270
those bets are nuts.
Like will it make it out of the first

2206
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,500
round?
Well yeah,

2207
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,810
yeah.
By decision even have like

2208
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:55,530
disqualification beds.
Yeah,

2209
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:56,950
exactly.
Again,

2210
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:00,380
I used to play a lot of cards.
I love prop bets.

2211
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:01,561
Just like,
you know,

2212
01:20:01,561 --> 01:20:02,900
like,
like in that moment it was like,

2213
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:04,850
I bet you,
I can guess within,

2214
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:06,710
you know,
a $100 how many chips are in front of

2215
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:06,770
you.

2216
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,411
Right?
Like,

2217
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:08,850
you know,
like that kind of stuff or like,

2218
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:09,870
you know,
or it's like,

2219
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:10,591
all right,
like,

2220
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:11,401
you know,
give me,

2221
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:12,181
you know,
give me a,

2222
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:13,560
you know,
one in 10 chance.

2223
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:16,620
Do you pull out a dollar bill from your
pocket and whatever the last number is.

2224
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:17,760
Like if I get it right,
you know,

2225
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,580
you can pay me 10 to one look.
Just like weird prop bets.

2226
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:23,370
Like people like,
like they like players like kind of go

2227
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:24,570
nuts with that kind of stuff.
Well,

2228
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:25,880
gambling junkies do.
Right?

2229
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:27,210
Exactly.
Look,

2230
01:20:27,211 --> 01:20:30,600
I remember us playing cards at this one
club and uh,

2231
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,130
this guy,
uh,

2232
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,130
just was sports betting like crazy even.
But now it's like,

2233
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:36,330
you know,
like two in the morning,

2234
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,030
three in the morning,
and he's looking down.

2235
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:40,680
He goes,
does anyone know anything about cricket?

2236
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,660
Was like,
that was the only game that was going

2237
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:42,750
on.

2238
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,430
There's a cricket game in India.
And he was like,

2239
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:45,620
yeah,
I'm going to like late.

2240
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:46,201
I was like,
dude,

2241
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:47,880
you actually have a problem like that.
It's like,

2242
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:48,271
you know,
yeah.

2243
01:20:48,271 --> 01:20:50,250
Like you have to like,
like that's a problem.

2244
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:53,970
You're betting on cricket and man,
it's two in the morning.

2245
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,960
Anyone know anything about rick?
Well that's the crazy thing about those

2246
01:20:57,961 --> 01:20:59,940
sports books.
So you look up and wash that shit.

2247
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:03,330
Here's our bunch of horses.
Yeah.

2248
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:05,100
Who's gonna win?
I've actually,

2249
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:07,740
I have a buddy who does it is into the
racism,

2250
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:09,720
stuff like that.
And like he streams it from like,

2251
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:11,430
uh,
it is kind of fun.

2252
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,390
Looks racing.
Yeah.

2253
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,250
It's kind of like,
but you kind of just randomly like,

2254
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:16,380
just like,
I'm sure number eight,

2255
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,290
you know,
come on eight.

2256
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:24,150
I knew a guy who got banned for life
from chariot races for trying to rig a

2257
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:27,900
race because he was his,
his horses winning and his horse wasn't

2258
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:28,630
supposed to win.

2259
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:33,150
This is literally standing up,
pulling back on the reins as his horse

2260
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:37,450
was winning.
It's like he's trying to slow him down.

2261
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,230
Cut It,
cut that shit off.

2262
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:42,380
His name was George the Greek.
That's what he's calling.

2263
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:45,090
Wow.
Guy From a pool hall and a White Plains

2264
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:45,924
New York.
Yeah.

2265
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,480
The Greek is like,
yeah,

2266
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:50,070
cause it was Jimmy the Greek back in the
day,

2267
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:50,700
you know?
Yeah.

2268
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,130
He was always trying to like,
he was even telling us,

2269
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,270
what is that?
It's a little vape.

2270
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,193
Oh no,
go ahead.

2271
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,150
He was always telling us that,
uh,

2272
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,710
he was gonna win the lawsuit.
I got to counselor.

2273
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:04,080
Counselor was his lawyer.
I got consolo slow economic case.

2274
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,570
It's fucking thing.
I got him locked down.

2275
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:10,620
Chariot racing.
How do you get into chariot racing to

2276
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,900
too,
I mean obviously you need,

2277
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,530
if it's a sport like yeah,
but like how do you like do you like,

2278
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,230
like fall into,
how do you fall into that line of work

2279
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:21,930
or again,
like when you were a kid are going when

2280
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:23,760
I grow up I want to be a chariot racer.

2281
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:27,940
He was a lot of that movie with a Kirk
Douglas then they cherish.

2282
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:29,663
Yeah,
exactly.

2283
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,810
Just like yeah you imagining himself was
like a bow and Arrow in the back with

2284
01:22:33,811 --> 01:22:37,300
those crazy risks plates where those
moving gas.

2285
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:40,890
Exactly.
I gotta listen greaves like a crazy

2286
01:22:40,891 --> 01:22:42,440
movie.
Cause if you look at the difference

2287
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:44,950
between like Spartacus and 300 right?
Yeah.

2288
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,450
You look at Spartacus,
they had like normal bodies.

2289
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,250
Like you guys just ate toast and you
know,

2290
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:51,840
didn't work out back in like the Roman
days.

2291
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:52,830
Like I would,
I was,

2292
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,870
I'd be considered tall.
I'm five,

2293
01:22:54,871 --> 01:22:58,460
seven like you know like a lot of those
soldiers like you know like in spartans

2294
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:01,530
and food they were like five,
five cause they probably have no food.

2295
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,280
There was a,
there was a lot of nutrition,

2296
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,040
I was gonna say to say malnutrition,

2297
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,530
but that was kind of like,
it wasn't straight malnutrition,

2298
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:10,480
it just wasn't good nutrition like kind
of thing.

2299
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,680
A lot of like,
uh,

2300
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:12,670
like salt,
pork,

2301
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:14,230
you know,
like that kind of thing.

2302
01:23:14,231 --> 01:23:18,160
A lot of like weird flatbreads,
even just not a lot of none,

2303
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:20,440
a lot of green there not a lot of
greens,

2304
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,730
you know,
just grain and salted beef.

2305
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:25,930
It was probably really hard to get good
food back then.

2306
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,330
Like as you're,
as you're growing up,

2307
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:31,540
you probably were always mounted,
nourished and no one was fat either.

2308
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,920
Right.
And it's very rare that people are,

2309
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,170
people were rarely fat.
Well that's why it's like a,

2310
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,510
um,
like a fat lady,

2311
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,880
uh,
like was considered like really,

2312
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,500
really sexy because it showed that she
was fat.

2313
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,200
She got some cash.
Exactly.

2314
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,010
Yeah,
look at that.

2315
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:49,660
That's why you see like that's why it's
like you see like the aphrodite like and

2316
01:23:49,661 --> 01:23:51,550
stuff like that and it's all very,
very curvy.

2317
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:54,220
Yeah.
They went through a whole era where

2318
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:57,220
those reuben ask women don't ask.
That was the thing.

2319
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,010
That's what everybody wanted.
I want to give me a big guy,

2320
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:06,700
some cushion for the pushing.
Now we're in danger right now.

2321
01:24:06,701 --> 01:24:09,040
We're treading in dangerous waters.
Even talking about that.

2322
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,890
I know.
Take me to Kirk Douglas.

2323
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,840
Find Kirk Douglas and spartacus
comparing them.

2324
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:18,350
Sporadic.
The sporadicness.

2325
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,410
Sporadic.
It's um,

2326
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,720
when you were in Paris,
did you know this?

2327
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,613
Oh,
there it is.

2328
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,010
Looking at,
Doug said a guy who's literally never

2329
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:28,120
swung a sword.
Yeah,

2330
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,600
he looks,
he looks a,

2331
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:31,930
here are the ones,
he already looks old there.

2332
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,590
Oh yeah,
he was,

2333
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:36,730
well I bet he was probably in his
thirties because people back then just

2334
01:24:36,731 --> 01:24:38,170
aged worse.
Yeah.

2335
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,600
They just,
I don't know what the fuck was going on.

2336
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:41,980
That just,
they didn't age good.

2337
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:42,720
And it's a,
it's the,

2338
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,940
it's the liquor and cigarettes.
Cigarettes and liquor.

2339
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,760
Yeah,
but you smoked cigarettes and you look

2340
01:24:48,761 --> 01:24:50,500
fantastic.
You look great.

2341
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,120
I agree.
What does that,

2342
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:54,700
yeah.
Let's say yes,

2343
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,580
please take a guess how old he was
during spartacus in Linkedin.

2344
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,340
I think he was a hair under 40 I think
you're right.

2345
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:08,380
I would go with 37.
What is it?

2346
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:13,470
44 oh yeah,
we'll say kind of looks like 44 today's

2347
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,790
44 yeah.
Like Daniel,

2348
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:19,900
Craig's Jack this fuck.
And he's probably like 44 how old Daniel

2349
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,790
Craig right now.
James Bond.

2350
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,130
But it doesn't,
he have like some like crow's feet or

2351
01:25:24,131 --> 01:25:28,100
whatever channel.
I know he's a thick daisy.

2352
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,020
The 50 50 wow.
Really?

2353
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:36,070
Just 50 mother fucker looking good.
How old are you?

2354
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:37,120
50 Oh,
look at you.

2355
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:39,340
Look at it.
You're a big dude.

2356
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:41,260
Look at that.
Jacked.

2357
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,420
You're a big dude,
but I can take you.

2358
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:47,810
Whoa.
That looks like fucking James Bond in

2359
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:49,900
May.
Not all these other pussies and he's my

2360
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:52,060
all time favorite.
James Bond by far.

2361
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,580
That's a real James Bond.
Yeah know I like his like,

2362
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:56,290
yeah,
I liked his steely resolve.

2363
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:59,290
My other favorite James Bond is a
potential James Bond.

2364
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:02,260
I don't know if he's a James Bond yet.
Is Idris Elba Idris sell button.

2365
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,340
That's exact.
And because

2366
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:09,550
white people are mad,
they're fantastic for moving,

2367
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:11,360
they get like Michael B.
Jordan.

2368
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:13,670
It's like everyone just calm down.
Look at that right there.

2369
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,270
Oh good Lord.
Luna's body.

2370
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,150
Look at that.
Look at that.

2371
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:18,080
This,
I mean,

2372
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,720
he's already kind of got a little,
little like he's got the beginning of,

2373
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:25,760
of meant it's not bad.
It's better than my body fat.

2374
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:30,080
He doesn't look like a guy who fought
with a fucking sword for a living.

2375
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:30,950
Yeah.
But that's how they,

2376
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:33,790
that's probably closer,
like more accurate to what,

2377
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:35,270
you know,
what actual,

2378
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:39,020
like Romans and you know,
not if there were actual gladiator,

2379
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,780
is there an actual gladiator they had a
swing swords around,

2380
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,430
look at that arm.
Come on.

2381
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:48,431
So I'm that army carrying those sorts
lean muscle.

2382
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:52,570
It's lean muscle.
Wirey he got some,

2383
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:55,790
he got some veins coming out,
bro.

2384
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:58,140
He's jacked.
But um,

2385
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,950
yeah,
this is Kubrick and people,

2386
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,460
people always forget.

2387
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:03,620
Yes.
Confirm that.

2388
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:06,080
But yeah,
that's amazing.

2389
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:07,760
Apparently he hated it too.
Like,

2390
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:08,210
you know,
you know,

2391
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:09,340
he hated the movie.
Yeah.

2392
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,540
It was probably one of those things he
had to do.

2393
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:13,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

2394
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,140
Geez.
God,

2395
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:16,860
I loved his movies.
Yeah.

2396
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,170
Yeah.
No,

2397
01:27:18,171 --> 01:27:21,050
this is actually one of the weaker ones.
It's really never read the shining.

2398
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,940
No,
it's really interesting.

2399
01:27:22,941 --> 01:27:24,740
Different.
Stephen King did not like it.

2400
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:25,520
Yeah.
Oh,

2401
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,750
the movie,
the movie,

2402
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,470
because they did the TV movie in the
early two thousands,

2403
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,240
Stephen [inaudible],
Stephen Webber,

2404
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:36,230
and uh,
he just decided that,

2405
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:40,250
you know,
like Kubrick had made Jack Nicholson

2406
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:45,280
crazy already and he didn't like that he
wanted a guy that was torn curtain crazy

2407
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:48,120
by the house.
Yeah.

2408
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:50,890
But then how the fuck are you going to
do that in a two hour movie?

2409
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,760
You know,
it's not scary hedges,

2410
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:53,601
you know,
like,

2411
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:54,210
they was like,
they were like,

2412
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,880
there's a thing,
it was like probably like,

2413
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,070
you know,
I bet you if you,

2414
01:27:57,071 --> 01:27:58,250
you know,
you read it or whatever,

2415
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,720
it's probably seems creepy.

2416
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,660
Like when he's like talking about how
the hedges are moving when he's not

2417
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:05,120
looking at stuff like that.
But when you physically see it,

2418
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,460
it's not scary at all.
You know what I mean?

2419
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:07,850
Like,
yeah.

2420
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,110
Like it just,
like things like that.

2421
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:11,330
Like,
just don't think that usually translate,

2422
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:13,670
but it worked in the book.
The book's amazing.

2423
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,860
The books really,
it's a big ass book too.

2424
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,330
It's a Stephen King.
I mean,

2425
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:17,931
they're all,
you know.

2426
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:19,850
Yeah.
I think it's a big ass book.

2427
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:20,710
Yeah,
there's a,

2428
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:23,480
I'm confusing it with the dark tower
series.

2429
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:25,610
There's also,
the stand is really thick too.

2430
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:27,740
That's a dictionary.
It's a paper weight.

2431
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,080
He was,
I mean it still is,

2432
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:32,030
but so fucking prolific.
The thing with the,

2433
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,680
the mazes,
it's like,

2434
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:35,330
yeah,
like the macy's keeps on kind of like

2435
01:28:35,331 --> 01:28:37,820
changing like the one,
the one that you see in the model there

2436
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:40,760
and the one that exists and there's also
a map on the outside of it.

2437
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:45,620
All three of those are different and the
bushes and get a look from the top.

2438
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,840
I think it's like kind of more like
stems.

2439
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,550
I don't think they were like thick
branches.

2440
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:51,470
Hack your way through.
Walk Straight.

2441
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:52,300
Yep.
No,

2442
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,410
it's true.
Plus he's scared of bushes.

2443
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:55,820
What are you scared of?
C'Mon,

2444
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:57,021
c'mon.
Well,

2445
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:59,940
the hedges that are moving in the book.
So monsters.

2446
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:02,580
Yeah,
there team and hedges.

2447
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,740
It's kind of like,
you know these like,

2448
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,540
like Edward scissorhands ask,
like kind of like,

2449
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:07,400
you know,
it's a kitten.

2450
01:29:07,401 --> 01:29:08,071
You know,
it's like,

2451
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:09,240
it's like,
and then it's like,

2452
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:10,820
Ooh,
it's moving when you're not looking and

2453
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:11,400
like,
oh,

2454
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:16,110
that's an adorable cat hedge that um,
that place,

2455
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,180
well that's supposed to be asked this
park.

2456
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,190
Is that what it's supposed to be?
That area?

2457
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,180
It's supposed to be somewhere in
Colorado that's like that.

2458
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,410
Yeah.
I mean,

2459
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:27,690
I think that's where they filmed it,
or at least the out,

2460
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,640
you know,
the outdoors.

2461
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,960
Some of it.
And I think they filmed some of it also

2462
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:33,150
in upstate New York.
There's a place like,

2463
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,040
yeah,
but like,

2464
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,310
and then they get like a studio,
I think.

2465
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,550
I think it was in London.
Usually Kubrick worked in out of London.

2466
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,200
But yeah,
the overlook hotel.

2467
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,060
There we go.
It actually is like,

2468
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:43,500
it's not called the overlooking in real
life,

2469
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:44,880
but yeah,
it's in Colorado.

2470
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,830
Yeah.
That was a fucking great movie.

2471
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,660
Yeah.
So creepy and weird.

2472
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:50,250
Yeah.
You shouldn't so many of them remember

2473
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:51,920
eyes wide shut.
That was another one that was,

2474
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,340
that's his last movie.
Yeah.

2475
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:56,730
A lot of people didn't like that one.
I thought that was fascinating.

2476
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:57,300
I,
you know,

2477
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,820
I'm a little soft on it,
like at least when it comes to like,

2478
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:00,940
I mean it's still great.
Right.

2479
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,130
But I can,
I put it lower on my coo lists.

2480
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,120
Um,
uh,

2481
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,140
yeah,
clockwork orange 2001.

2482
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:07,750
I mean like,
you know,

2483
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:08,583
yeah.
You name it,

2484
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,160
you know,
during his spare time he used to do

2485
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:14,070
complex mathematics.
That sounds about right.

2486
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,740
Yes,
that's right.

2487
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,420
It was like a legit genius.
Yeah.

2488
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,650
He has a um,
archives in,

2489
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:22,770
I think it's in London,
but there's actually the standing cooper

2490
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:26,880
like library and yet she can kind of go
through his scripts and his notes and

2491
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:27,930
all that kind of stuff.
Looking at,

2492
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:30,750
there's like a whole like archive that's
supposed to be kind of pretty neat.

2493
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:35,080
Do you see yourself over making movies
like producing or directing or writing?

2494
01:30:35,081 --> 01:30:36,660
So if it's,
you know,

2495
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,230
peaks my fancy kind of thing,
he peaks my fancy,

2496
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,200
uh,
I'd be open to doing something that,

2497
01:30:43,201 --> 01:30:44,130
you know,
like a,

2498
01:30:44,131 --> 01:30:46,350
um,
it's a matter of like kind of the right

2499
01:30:46,351 --> 01:30:48,300
kind of thing,
timing and so forth.

2500
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,910
Like right now it wouldn't be ideal,
but like,

2501
01:30:50,911 --> 01:30:52,200
you know,
a year from now,

2502
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:53,790
like yeah,
I probably might be a little freer.

2503
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:54,840
Like that kind of thing,
you know?

2504
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:55,674
Yeah.
Like,

2505
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:57,900
you know,
hopefully the company will be moving on

2506
01:30:57,901 --> 01:30:59,370
to tailored by that and kind of thing.
Okay.

2507
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,260
Here's something I want to ask you about
Paris.

2508
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,600
This is one thing that I was only there
for a short period of time,

2509
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:05,130
but one thing is I was shocked,
stuck,

2510
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:10,580
shocked by you.
Shucked shook is that all those people

2511
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:16,050
are eating a bread and they're all
eating cheese and wine and no one's fat.

2512
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,670
Yup.
What the fuck is that?

2513
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:18,451
Uh,
again,

2514
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:21,360
it's kind of the way that you kind of
eat how you kind of had chemo.

2515
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:23,190
You have a light breakfast,
but then a heavy dinner.

2516
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,270
I think that has to do with it.

2517
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:29,400
And also you can't call yourself a
[inaudible] like a bakery and less,

2518
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:33,910
you make everything from scratch.
So everything's made from scratch aid.

2519
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:35,950
Like the thing is just that like you're
like,

2520
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,840
Baguette will be stale in 24 hours.
Same thing with the croissants.

2521
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:44,490
Like there's no preservatives in
anything like all out in general out

2522
01:31:44,491 --> 01:31:47,040
there,
like all your food spoils faster like in

2523
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:48,840
your fridge because like,
yeah,

2524
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:49,620
it's,
it's,

2525
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,790
you know,
it's fresh.

2526
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,340
There's no hormones and things.
Steroids.

2527
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:58,530
He was an oncologist from Paris and he
lived in America and he went back to

2528
01:31:58,531 --> 01:32:03,070
France and brought back cheese because
the cheese that he could get over there,

2529
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:06,520
it was not homogenized or pasteurized.
It's literally illegal here.

2530
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:11,730
So he would have to Tuck it in his carry
on or it is a check luggage and just

2531
01:32:11,891 --> 01:32:14,740
hope that no one would check when she
got the wheel of cheese.

2532
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:17,100
Literally like walked back wheel,
excuse me sir.

2533
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:19,930
And when he served it to us,
it was like precious,

2534
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:21,580
this precious cheese.
I mean,

2535
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:24,880
they make raw cheese and American now,
but this was,

2536
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,920
but it's like specific and like,
yeah,

2537
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:27,850
like you have to like,
you know,

2538
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:30,040
it's like,
it's Boutiquey kind of thing,

2539
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,330
cheek,
you know,

2540
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:34,140
niche kind of thing.
No,

2541
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:36,880
see thing with things like their eggs.
They don't refrigerate their eggs over

2542
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:38,950
there because he's done in the different
kind of process.

2543
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:40,390
Uh,
I think,

2544
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,630
uh,
I forget what it is,

2545
01:32:41,631 --> 01:32:43,540
have eggs that I get from my chickens.
You don't,

2546
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,480
I don't refrigerate them.
It's the first year after a while you

2547
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:48,670
can just watch them.
But I think in America it's,

2548
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:51,310
I think we like,
I think it's like we,

2549
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,300
I think we like,
like,

2550
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,030
like hit him with it.
We're like super hot la.

2551
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,160
There's a different process than they
have in Europe.

2552
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,290
So in general you're not supposed to
refrigerate it ranks.

2553
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:02,920
There were in state states are supposed
to just a different,

2554
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:05,200
it's a different process of how things
are done.

2555
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:07,570
Yeah,
the preservative thing makes a lot of

2556
01:33:07,571 --> 01:33:09,850
sense.
The preservatives and I think there's

2557
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:13,360
also,
there's also different shit that's in,

2558
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:15,400
in wheat and there's different kinds of
wheat.

2559
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:17,080
They have heirloom wheat,
wheat,

2560
01:33:17,081 --> 01:33:19,460
it's like older wheat before,
you know,

2561
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,080
we started messing with it and they also
dairy cattle and things like that.

2562
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,520
Uh,
it's a grass fed,

2563
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,690
whereas in the states it's corn fed.
Right.

2564
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,890
And also I just noticed like in general
out there like I was eating less red

2565
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:31,610
meat.
You have a lot more chicken and a lot of

2566
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32,890
uh,
pig,

2567
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,130
lots of ham,
like,

2568
01:33:34,131 --> 01:33:34,871
you know,
that kind of thing.

2569
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:37,780
Ham is a very lucky no,
just what will they just dry it or

2570
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:42,781
whatever and just cured legs when they
just take that thin slice off.

2571
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,190
I'm actually going there,
uh,

2572
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,790
going back in a couple of days.
So yeah,

2573
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,220
again,
uh,

2574
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:52,870
and you know,
we really nancy,

2575
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:55,090
because I'm going out to Berlin,
I'm doing this thing,

2576
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:57,760
it's called the people festival look out
there.

2577
01:33:57,761 --> 01:34:00,490
And so I'm gonna do something like
hanging out with some friends I know

2578
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:02,980
like a good lake full fest.
It's called the people festival.

2579
01:34:02,981 --> 01:34:07,050
I mean it's a music fest and I know like
a good like 12 or 20 like of the acts

2580
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,120
got like,
they're like my friends and stuff and

2581
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,820
still get to like go to Berlin and I'm
going to be like the roving reporter

2582
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:14,320
pretty well.
I found myself,

2583
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,790
you know,
something to do.

2584
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,940
Yeah.
It's going to be like podcasting and so

2585
01:34:18,941 --> 01:34:20,050
forth.
Cause there's a lot of like,

2586
01:34:20,051 --> 01:34:21,130
yeah,
like there's a lot of like cool

2587
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,020
musicians doing it and so,
oh that's cool.

2588
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:23,980
So yeah,
it's a,

2589
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:28,510
so I'm kind of like fine from La to New
York spending the night cause I hate

2590
01:34:28,511 --> 01:34:31,390
taking like super long flights and then
New York to Paris,

2591
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:35,220
a couple of days of leisure and then you
then you know Paris to Berlin,

2592
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,410
you know it's you.

2593
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,530
Even when you do that,
you tilt your head sideways and throw

2594
01:34:38,531 --> 01:34:42,820
your head back.
A man of leisure travel at my whim,

2595
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:45,670
I should have a Manhattan in my hand.
Like ha ha.

2596
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,770
Oh shall we booked you a straight flight
to Europe?

2597
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:48,750
No,
no,

2598
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,790
of course not.
That's too much time in the [inaudible].

2599
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:53,440
I like to puddle jump.
I want to go to New York,

2600
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:57,100
I'll go to New York.
Perhaps I'll shop perhaps a shop in

2601
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:01,420
Paris in empower you go to a cafe.
Maybe I'll take the,

2602
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:06,000
the channel to London just for a day
trip a day trip.

2603
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:08,900
Me As I've,
I've a fantastic t shirt shop that I

2604
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:12,110
love now.
One of the things that people were in

2605
01:35:12,111 --> 01:35:14,480
America that don't go to Paris or
worried about it.

2606
01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:19,070
It's like people hear horror stories
about the immigration nightmare in Paris

2607
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:23,330
and that Paris is somehow or another
turning into this criminal cesspool

2608
01:35:23,331 --> 01:35:26,540
because of all these immigrants and it's
very dangerous there now.

2609
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:29,450
Hence those shootings that you heard
about and the,

2610
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:31,370
you know,
it is actually one of the most

2611
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:35,000
ethnically diverse cities in all of
Europe.

2612
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,170
Like I was actually like,
you know,

2613
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,033
yeah.
You know,

2614
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:40,680
you see more black people in like the
first five minutes of being there than

2615
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,900
you do in the whole of like oslow or
like Berlin or something like that.

2616
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:46,221
Yeah,
no,

2617
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:46,580
it's,
it's,

2618
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,320
it's,
it is like kind of,

2619
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:51,350
it's culturally and ethnically diverse.
Um,

2620
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:51,951
the,
you know,

2621
01:35:51,951 --> 01:35:54,050
when it comes to all this like shootings
and things like that,

2622
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:58,160
they're guilty of being landlocked.
You know,

2623
01:35:58,161 --> 01:35:59,820
the UK can kind of control the,
the,

2624
01:35:59,821 --> 01:36:00,470
the,
you know,

2625
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:02,100
the flow of traffic,
you know,

2626
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,700
people kind of coming in and out because
they're an island nation.

2627
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,830
Whereas,
like with the kind of open borders,

2628
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:07,730
if that you can,
you know,

2629
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:11,510
you can buy a gun in Greece and take the
train,

2630
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:12,770
you know,
like all the way over.

2631
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,450
Like,
you know,

2632
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:14,750
especially when it comes to like the
old,

2633
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:15,584
uh,
uh,

2634
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:16,320
at the,
uh,

2635
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,540
like the Balkans or whatever.
Like,

2636
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:20,000
you know,
there's a lot of leftover Soviet era,

2637
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:22,100
like collision a cost.
That's why they always have like these

2638
01:36:22,101 --> 01:36:24,860
Russian made like guns and so forth.
Uh,

2639
01:36:24,861 --> 01:36:26,160
and yeah,
that's what I mean.

2640
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,180
If it's easier for,
so,

2641
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:30,680
you know,
somewhere like the UK to like lock off

2642
01:36:30,681 --> 01:36:32,180
their borders or at least have like,
you know,

2643
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:33,440
we're as friends.
It's like I said,

2644
01:36:33,441 --> 01:36:35,480
it's guilty of being landlocked
essentially.

2645
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,460
Um,
the,

2646
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,450
you know,
they is more difficult to secure.

2647
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:40,430
Is that the blunt force truth?
Yes.

2648
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:44,070
Blunt force truth
bft row

2649
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,500
and that's the bft.
Yeah,

2650
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,310
there you go.
People should start using that.

2651
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:54,700
The bft as the Hashtag bft t that's a
bft coming your way.

2652
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:55,850
It's like,
Ooh,

2653
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:57,440
delicious.
Um,

2654
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,170
but they,
they,

2655
01:36:59,171 --> 01:37:00,260
the,
the big fear,

2656
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:04,250
like the one thing that people were
terrified of was that this was going to

2657
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,540
happen to the rest of Europe.

2658
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,940
That like what,
what's happening to Paris and Paris has

2659
01:37:07,941 --> 01:37:12,380
fallen apart and you can go through some
of the ghetto areas and Paris and you

2660
01:37:12,381 --> 01:37:12,890
know,
there was a,

2661
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:15,260
someone filmed something where a Jewish
man,

2662
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,150
a walk through,
uh,

2663
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:17,990
these,
uh,

2664
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:19,970
Muslim ghettos and they're screaming
out,

2665
01:37:19,971 --> 01:37:24,350
I'm all these antisemetic things.
I have not seen that.

2666
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,480
But you know,
at my neighbors,

2667
01:37:26,481 --> 01:37:28,160
uh,
only a couple blocks away from like the

2668
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:31,250
Jewish kind of neighborhoods like that.
It's a good spot to live.

2669
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:33,230
Heck yeah.
He was good to live near the Jewish

2670
01:37:33,231 --> 01:37:34,800
folk.
They keep it together.

2671
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:36,410
Yeah.
So I'm like,

2672
01:37:36,411 --> 01:37:37,700
I'm already half Jewish.
You know,

2673
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,780
I was in New York recently when we were
in Brooklyn and a,

2674
01:37:41,781 --> 01:37:43,460
I was with Arri,
my friend Ari,

2675
01:37:43,461 --> 01:37:47,720
who uh,
grew up Orthodox Jew and he took us

2676
01:37:47,721 --> 01:37:52,721
through this neighborhood where they
have like the crazy frisbee for hats on

2677
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:57,270
the curls and they pay us and the,
the,

2678
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:59,750
the fucking,
the yarn hanging off their belt,

2679
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:00,750
all the weird shit.

2680
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,940
And you know,
he was basically saying like,

2681
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:06,210
these people,
like they are here but they're not here.

2682
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:08,190
Like they don't know what the fuck is
going on.

2683
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:11,700
They have no idea who Kim Kardashian is.
They don't listen to any of the music.

2684
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,950
They all stick together.
They inner marry the Merion side of the

2685
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,010
community if they get married young and
look at it.

2686
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:21,030
And it's so interesting seeing them all
walk around the streets,

2687
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,740
the sheets,
some of them do.

2688
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:24,810
Right.
It's not acidic though too.

2689
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:26,880
So there's just a,
just a hallway.

2690
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,700
So I think just throw a sheet over and
just,

2691
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:32,310
you know,
just perfectly framed the vagina right

2692
01:38:32,311 --> 01:38:34,320
there and I'll take care of it from
here.

2693
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:36,600
They don't want to touch naked women.
Ryan,

2694
01:38:36,601 --> 01:38:39,030
is that the idea?
I think it was a modesty kind of thing.

2695
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:40,890
Kind of like tradition,
kind of.

2696
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,780
I just do that at home.
Just for fun.

2697
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:43,940
Yeah.
He's like,

2698
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,060
honey,
why are these,

2699
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,190
why are there holes and all these sheets
show hush.

2700
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:51,800
Jesus wants this or
God we killed Jesus.

2701
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:56,310
Jesus was a Jew.
It's okay.

2702
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,280
It's okay.
Um,

2703
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:01,380
so like this,
this community that we were driving

2704
01:39:01,381 --> 01:39:03,930
through is massive,
like Brooklyn and it was going to say

2705
01:39:03,931 --> 01:39:05,580
Brooklyn,
like kind of in the southern kind of

2706
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:08,370
parch massive community.
Yeah.

2707
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:10,380
I didn't know how big Brooklyn was.
It's,

2708
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,940
it's big.
Fucking huge.

2709
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:13,060
It really is.
Yeah.

2710
01:39:13,061 --> 01:39:15,240
It's kind of like you're talking about
the neighborhood that kind of like north

2711
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,770
of Red Hook,
but right there on the river.

2712
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:20,970
Cause I bet I walked from my place in
Lower Manhattan all the way down to red

2713
01:39:20,971 --> 01:39:21,750
hook,
like one day.

2714
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:24,390
And as long as it take maybe about an
hour,

2715
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:25,980
an hour ish.
But that's it.

2716
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:26,930
Yeah.
I'm,

2717
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:27,650
I'm,
I work at,

2718
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:30,300
I walk in a New York Pace.
He must have been sprinting.

2719
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:30,980
Yeah.
I,

2720
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:31,690
I'm,
I'm uh,

2721
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:33,420
I walk into New York base.
I'm on a walker.

2722
01:39:33,421 --> 01:39:36,810
That's how I see something that you run
seven miles an hour.

2723
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,660
That's like a fairly good clip.
It's gotta be more than seven miles.

2724
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:40,810
Um,
no,

2725
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:41,790
no,
it's actually,

2726
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:44,220
no it's not.
You have to understand that the whole of

2727
01:39:44,221 --> 01:39:46,230
Manhattan is,
I think it's like 14 miles,

2728
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:49,170
something like that.
14 by four and I'm already living in the

2729
01:39:49,171 --> 01:39:50,740
southern part.
Oh yeah.

2730
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:52,870
It's probably,
I don't know,

2731
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:54,660
like about three,
three miles,

2732
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,450
three miles.
I've walked about three to four miles an

2733
01:39:57,451 --> 01:39:59,550
hour.
One of the guys that was there with us,

2734
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:03,360
the guy who was driving us was telling
us how Brooklyn has just overwhelmed

2735
01:40:03,361 --> 01:40:06,750
with building construction apartment
buildings now.

2736
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:09,270
And everyone's moving out of Manhattan
into Brooklyn.

2737
01:40:09,290 --> 01:40:10,020
Yeah.
It's,

2738
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:13,230
it's because the thing about Manhattan
is that it's finite.

2739
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:14,191
Look,
you know,

2740
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:17,610
so the only way you can build upwards,
but you can only do that so much.

2741
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,610
And so it,
I let people were getting like

2742
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:21,480
displaced,
like you have to have enough money just

2743
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:23,400
to stay on the island of Manhattan.

2744
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:26,100
And even people like that are getting
displaced then like,

2745
01:40:26,101 --> 01:40:26,581
yeah,
they,

2746
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:27,900
it's Brooklyn,
queens,

2747
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,010
et cetera.
Hoboken,

2748
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:33,000
the people that I know that live in
Manhattan always have this thought in

2749
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,710
their head that one day they might live
in La.

2750
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:36,960
Yeah.
Even bordain was saying,

2751
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:38,430
ah,
sometimes I think about it,

2752
01:40:38,431 --> 01:40:42,270
I think about the weather and I know
there's a lot of good things about La

2753
01:40:42,271 --> 01:40:45,150
and a lot of Nice places.
I lived here for the better part of

2754
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:47,820
eight years in my early twenties and
stuff.

2755
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:48,931
And it's a,
you know,

2756
01:40:48,931 --> 01:40:50,580
I mean it makes you soft.
I mean like,

2757
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:51,660
cause it,
yeah,

2758
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:53,770
I think just like with the weather and
things like that.

2759
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,030
And it's also like,
yeah,

2760
01:40:55,031 --> 01:40:56,890
the leisurely kind of like kind of
thing.

2761
01:40:56,891 --> 01:41:00,130
Like there's not a lot of drinking.
It's a lot more smoking weed just

2762
01:41:00,131 --> 01:41:01,990
because like everyone has to drive,
you know,

2763
01:41:01,991 --> 01:41:02,950
so nobody like,
you know,

2764
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,960
so everyone just like,
it went by so fast because there's no

2765
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:11,080
seasons,
it's all the same.

2766
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:12,460
So like I blinked and it was like,
wait,

2767
01:41:12,461 --> 01:41:15,610
I've been living here for five years
because I'm from New York.

2768
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:18,350
It's like we have,
we have our winter winter's long.

2769
01:41:18,351 --> 01:41:22,120
It's one of the major cities like where
you have a hundred degree weather shift

2770
01:41:22,121 --> 01:41:25,330
in one year it can be a hundred degrees
and later that you can be zero degrees.

2771
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:26,890
That's true.
That's interesting.

2772
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,380
It's kind of like,
it's kind of a harsh kind of climate a

2773
01:41:29,381 --> 01:41:32,650
little bit and the summers they're like
suck cause it's just the humidity.

2774
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,630
It just sticks to you and it's smelly.

2775
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:36,760
Look at me,
I'm not a huge fan of New York in the

2776
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,040
summer.
It gets very pissed like,

2777
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:40,380
yes,
yes you can.

2778
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:43,740
You can just,
it sticks to you at six year hair like

2779
01:41:43,741 --> 01:41:45,280
him.
He never lived in the city though.

2780
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:48,040
I might've missed my shot because you
know,

2781
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:51,540
now I'm married and kids and the whole
deal and I'm so sorry.

2782
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,670
Kind of stand up comedian.
It's a lot of the,

2783
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:57,850
the the only thing that we could
possibly make me live there is that like

2784
01:41:57,851 --> 01:42:00,000
I could do stand up there very easily.
Yeah.

2785
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:00,701
Yeah.
You know,

2786
01:42:00,701 --> 01:42:01,810
it was a lot of,
a lot of like,

2787
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:03,850
yeah,
well I think the island of Manhattan

2788
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:05,500
only has like six of them.
Technically.

2789
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,820
I think it's like five or six.
Uh,

2790
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:10,660
comedy clubs get nick.
It was five or six.

2791
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:12,370
Yeah.
There's gotta be more than that.

2792
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,090
I don't know.

2793
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:14,920
Like it's,
cause I have a buddy who was,

2794
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:18,640
the seller has to clubs.
There's danger fields.

2795
01:42:18,641 --> 01:42:23,620
There's Caroline's,
there's a Eastville comedy club.

2796
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:29,420
This is God.
My buddy opened up one in like 2010

2797
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:34,590
we're already at seven.
Well he opened up one like in about like

2798
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,100
2010 or some like that.
And he was talking about,

2799
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:38,450
he goes,
actually there's not a ton you already

2800
01:42:38,451 --> 01:42:39,284
said.
Yeah,

2801
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:40,263
yeah,
I saw that.

2802
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:41,133
That's what I mean.
He was actually,

2803
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,130
you said like,
yeah,

2804
01:42:42,131 --> 01:42:43,390
he goes,
when I opened up there was only like

2805
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:44,141
six,
you know,

2806
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:45,700
like he was like the seventh one or
something like that.

2807
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:48,640
Because it's surprising,
at least on the island of Manhattan

2808
01:42:48,641 --> 01:42:50,620
itself,
there's not as many comedy clubs as you

2809
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:52,000
think.
Do you know,

2810
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:54,380
even though it's a mecca turn of the
century night,

2811
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:58,300
the 19th to the 18th to the 19th to the
20th century,

2812
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:03,280
there was a thousand or close to a
thousand billiard halls.

2813
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,313
Oh,
Manhattan.

2814
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:05,470
Oh Geez.
Yeah,

2815
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,100
yeah.
No,

2816
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,990
no.
That's what men did before video games

2817
01:43:07,991 --> 01:43:10,990
and pretty much,
and that's like when men didn't want to

2818
01:43:10,991 --> 01:43:13,750
have families,
they match bachelor life.

2819
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:16,090
Would they would live in these pool hall
to play billiards,

2820
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:20,930
Gamble and as Smoky Smoky Pool Hall?
No,

2821
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:24,040
there's,
I spent a lot of pool back to the love.

2822
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:24,874
It's voice.

2823
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:32,320
Uh,
yeah.

2824
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:33,970
There's actually not a lot of bill your
clubs there anymore.

2825
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,880
I mean,
and I'm saying they do exist but like

2826
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:37,350
getting,
you know,

2827
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:41,020
there's only like a hint like smattering
of them to the bowling alley.

2828
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:42,760
It's like there's only a few bowling
alley.

2829
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,690
That's right.
Yeah.

2830
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,930
I think even like bowlmor like moved,
like kind of thing like into knew that

2831
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:51,250
that was the trendy spot.
There's going to be like croquet,

2832
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,530
bygone play,
some badminton.

2833
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:57,050
Yeah.
Forgotten era games.

2834
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,640
Let's play some squash.
But do you,

2835
01:43:59,641 --> 01:44:02,000
do you,
are you enjoying it out here now?

2836
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:02,810
Yeah,
I mean,

2837
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,900
I have a good life out of here.
Like I have like a really pretty little

2838
01:44:05,901 --> 01:44:06,720
family.
You know,

2839
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,090
they've got a pretty girl,
pretty dog,

2840
01:44:08,091 --> 01:44:09,750
pretty cat and all that stuff and
everything's cool.

2841
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:10,641
Yeah.
We're going to move,

2842
01:44:10,641 --> 01:44:12,290
we're going to like,
you were doing the house thing and all

2843
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:13,580
that kind of style.
Are you going to get a house?

2844
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:14,360
Well,
she,

2845
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:15,970
well she is and I'm,
I'm just gonna,

2846
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,110
I'm just gonna hit you right.
And I miss,

2847
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,150
yeah.
More and more my ship in or did you just

2848
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:20,790
run into,
it's,

2849
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:21,240
it's,
it's,

2850
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,250
it's,
it's on her,

2851
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:23,990
like she was already,
she was already looking and so like,

2852
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,970
yeah.
So I think she's an escrow like right

2853
01:44:25,971 --> 01:44:26,804
now,
essentially.

2854
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:29,360
It just started like today,
but if it goes south,

2855
01:44:29,361 --> 01:44:31,250
she could just fucking boot you out.
Yep.

2856
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:32,810
Yep.
Just look looking to do it.

2857
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,440
But I get my stuff at my place in New
York too.

2858
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:39,950
I bought,
I bought like in like the 90s smart.

2859
01:44:39,951 --> 01:44:40,950
I'm doing okay.
You know?

2860
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:42,710
Yeah.
But a proper loft.

2861
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:44,420
Like I said,
I big syndrome,

2862
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:46,550
I have the movie big and I'm like,
that's what I want.

2863
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:50,720
So like elevator opens up to like a big
room and looking at it yet,

2864
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:51,471
like I've,
I've,

2865
01:44:51,471 --> 01:44:53,670
uh,
I have more mannequins than like,

2866
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:55,850
you would think.
Like we used to have an American apparel

2867
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:59,900
downstairs and I was walking like out
one day and there was just a pilot

2868
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,620
mannequin parts and I was like,
oh my God,

2869
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:01,980
look,
God,

2870
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,360
I forget the,
it's like an insight.

2871
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:05,551
Then I told,
uh,

2872
01:45:05,551 --> 01:45:06,590
I told my super,
or like,

2873
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:07,260
you know,
cause uh,

2874
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,990
it's in the same kind of building
complex.

2875
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:10,570
I said,
listen to everybody to get rid of like

2876
01:45:10,571 --> 01:45:12,590
any mannequin things.
Like tell him to come to me first.

2877
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:15,350
What the fuck do you do these math?
They closed down and like,

2878
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:16,370
yeah,
like I got like,

2879
01:45:16,371 --> 01:45:19,220
I have so many mannequins.
It's ridiculous.

2880
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,070
Just these mannequin parts.
I have no idea what to do with them

2881
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:22,900
either.
I have no,

2882
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,410
I give them away.
Like it's like presence.

2883
01:45:24,411 --> 01:45:27,950
Like here's a leg,
you know what you're talking about.

2884
01:45:27,951 --> 01:45:30,560
All the different little cars that you
bought a bunch of.

2885
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:31,970
Again,
every time I go to the pharmacy you have

2886
01:45:31,971 --> 01:45:33,680
to buy a toy car.
And now it's like,

2887
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:37,370
I try not to double up on things.
So it's like only one ambulance.

2888
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:40,700
Only one fire truck.
Only one corvette.

2889
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:41,120
Yeah,
no.

2890
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,650
And it's like now it's getting
ridiculous,

2891
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:44,440
but I,
for some reason I call,

2892
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,910
I'm like,
I hoard things and I collect things

2893
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:47,331
like,
you know,

2894
01:45:47,331 --> 01:45:49,970
and at the same time I'm like,
I'll figure out what this is for kind of

2895
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:50,180
thing.

2896
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:50,810
Like,
you know,

2897
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:52,550
I'll do something with those mannequins
at some point.

2898
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:54,050
Somebody like those are going to pay
off.

2899
01:45:54,051 --> 01:45:55,910
I swear.
That's the kind of Shit that drives

2900
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:58,250
women graze late,
ladies and gentlemen.

2901
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:02,420
I am going to say invest in mannequins.
It's a growth industry.

2902
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:03,663
It's,
it's,

2903
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:06,890
there's this,
there's a high ceiling on mannequins.

2904
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:10,040
I'm telling you kids,
I think that's a freedom thing when you

2905
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:11,240
do whatever you want.
So you're like,

2906
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:12,700
fuck it,
I'm just going to buy a mannequin.

2907
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:13,563
Yeah.
Yeah.

2908
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:15,830
So yeah.
And then when they closed down it was

2909
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:16,101
like,
yeah,

2910
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:18,410
I've got like 20 mannequins.
Do you get them for free or did you have

2911
01:46:18,411 --> 01:46:18,980
to buy them?
No.

2912
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:21,620
So they were gonna like sell them and it
was something like there was like,

2913
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:25,080
oh we have a like 16 of them.
Uh,

2914
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:29,000
well some to you for $500 and I said
listen,

2915
01:46:29,001 --> 01:46:33,140
I said I could do that or I could pay
you,

2916
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,060
you know,
or I can give you $40 I can give you

2917
01:46:35,061 --> 01:46:40,061
$200 for them and then give you $200
because the place is closing down the

2918
01:46:40,161 --> 01:46:43,160
store gets the $200 but then it's
another 200 in your pocket kind of

2919
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:43,530
thing.

2920
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:45,830
Cause cause the store is closing down
anyway.

2921
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:47,780
Well cause because they're not going to
look,

2922
01:46:47,781 --> 01:46:49,470
they don't have a job starting next
week.

2923
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,160
So like they really

2924
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:50,911
don't care.
So look,

2925
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:52,590
yeah.
So I got him for cheaper look just by

2926
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:55,830
pretty much bribing.
The dude had offered him a drawing.

2927
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:58,870
I know there's a little sketch market
so,

2928
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,600
well listen man it was great meeting.
You need to.

2929
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:07,020
I had to do this.

gotten through what you've gotten
through.

2934
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:14,611
It wasn't,
like I said,

2935
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:15,830
it wasn't too traumatic.
I'm going to,
