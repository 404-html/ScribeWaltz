make and manage your own website.

21
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,720

thing that everybody has to have to pay a

lot of money to do, but with

We're also brought to you by on at.com
on it is a human optimization website.

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,260
What we sell is a bunch of shit that
makes your body and your life work better.

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,410
Things like strength and conditioning
equipment like kettle bells and battle

45
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,890
ropes, all shit that Steve
Maxwell knows a lot about.

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,090
We sell ab wheels, medicine
balls, things along those lines.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,650
We also sell healthy snack foods
like hemp force protein bars,

48
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,040
very nutritious and healthy
hemp protein powder with very,

49
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,490
very little sugar. Um, well the hemp
force protein powder that we saw,

50
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,210
we buy the finest protein powder
from Canada. Unfortunately,

51
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,060
hopefully we're going to be able to
buy it in America now because they've

52
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:17,920
changed a lot of the laws now at least
statewide allowing people to grow hemp.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,370
A lot of misconceptions
when it comes to hemp, uh,

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,440
the big one is that somehow or another
you could test positive for marijuana at

55
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,730
your job. You know, if you
have a job that tests you,

56
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,880
you don't have to worry about it.
Hemp has zero THC in it.

57
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,320
You're not going to test positive for it.

58
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,980
But I should let you know that
if you eat poppy seed bagels,

59
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,450
you can test positive for heroin. I
know that sounds crazy, but it is true.

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,200
It's happened to someone I know. Uh, you
have to be careful about that. In fact,

61
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:49,201
a guy was imprisoned in Jew in Dubai
because they had one of those weird drug

62
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,370
test things they do at their airports.

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,420
They have like some sophisticated drug
sniffing mechanisms and this guy had

64
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,650
eaten a poppy seed Bagel Heathrow airport
and he had poppy seeds on his body.

65
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,950
So he tested positive for heroin
with they're sniffing machine.

66
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,010
They locked this fucking guy in jail
and they had to figure out that, oh,

67
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:09,700
you just ate a Bagel. Okay. And
they let them go, whoa. Anyway,

68
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,220
[inaudible] you don't have to worry
about that. I'll, I'll any of that shit.

69
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,900
And a very high in protein, very
nutritious and very, very low in sugar.

70
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,590
In fact,

71
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,480
a one portion of hemp force protein
powder only has one gram of naturally

72
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,600
occurring sugar. And uh, I think
when we talked to Steve Maxwell,

73
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:29,170
he'll agree with me that sugar super bad
for you. A lot of people like that shit.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,550
You got to get off at folks.

75
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,060
Sugar is probably one of the worst
things for your body. Fucking terrible,

76
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,750
unfortunately. Terrible and
delicious. Like much like life is.

77
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,710
There's a yin and a Yang to this shit.
Anyway,

78
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,880
all the stuff that we sell at [inaudible]
dot com is explained in detail on the

79
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,390
site. We tried to sell the very
best stuff that we can buy,

the Joe Rogan experience.
Joe Rogan podcast,

90
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,610
my knight.
Good to see you,

91
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,444

92
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,050
Great to see you again to Steve Maxwell.
Uh, is uh, for folks who don't know,

93
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:52,290
a long time Brazilian Jujitsu,
black belt,

94
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,200
long time strength and conditioning guru.
Uh,

95
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,090
and my friend and I found out
about you, uh, DVDs. Actually,

96
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:03,080
I think someone from the underground
posted up a link to one of your DVDs a

97
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,590
while back and I got one of
your Kettlebell Dvds, um,

98
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,620
which I thought was a very
informative and very interesting.

99
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,670
And then I started reading about your
lifestyle and reading about your,

100
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:17,960
your philosophies on training and you're
reading some of your blog entries and

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,310
uh,
you're a,

102
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:23,330
you're an unusual dude when it comes
to the strength and conditioning and

103
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:27,780
fitness and you know, just uh, the,
the wellness advocates, you know,

104
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,160
usually have a bunch of different schools
of thought when it comes to those.

105
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:35,660
He got meatheads who would just send to
lifting the heaviest weights that they

106
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:40,130
can and getting as big as they can.
But you're sort of a Weirdo man.

107
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:44,120
You're like traveling the world, you're
doing seminars all over the place. You're,

108
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,690
you're eating very little food.
You're, you know, you're, you've,

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,710
you've sort of like,

110
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,700
I've got a lot of people interested in
how you're living your life these days.

111
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,340
Well, I've definitely gone
through an evolution. You know,

112
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:59,820
I've been at this for 51 years.
I started when it was like 10 years old.

113
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,340
That's when you started working out.
When I was 10, my father got me a, uh,

114
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,370
a York barbell set. York was just down
the road from Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

115
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,850
And uh, I was one of those kids that
was sort of weakened, scrawny and uh,

116
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,320
basically getting picked on by some
of the neighborhood kids. And My,

117
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,440
my father kind of saw
where this was going,

118
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,210
got me the barbell Sapp and I
literally made me go out for wrestling,

119
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,410
really made me,

120
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,210
I went kicking and screaming and then I
found out it was actually pretty good at

121
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:30,720
it.

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,470
Will you, uh, you must be happy, you
must have thanked him at some point?

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,760
Oh, for sure. Absolutely. I mean,

124
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:39,240
he had tried to teach us both me and
my brother boxing and so forth in the

125
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,510
backyard. And uh, I, I learned
early. I didn't like to get hit,

126
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,520
but I sure would like to
clinch it. Take guys down, man.

127
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,230
Well that's a sign of intelligence.
It was just a natural evolution.

128
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:52,050
And then I discovered, hey man, I can
barely got this thing for wrestling.

129
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,430
And all my training was geared to making
me a better athlete as opposed to the

130
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:57,570
body beautiful.

131
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,530
Or even a power lifting
or Olympic lifting.

132
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,210
I was always interested in improved
performance for my chosen activity.

133
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,340
And back then that wasn't
that common. Right. I mean,

134
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:12,400
back then everybody was trying
to be like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

135
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,770
Everybody was trying to lift
weights and get huge and,

136
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,231
well,

137
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:20,231
this was in the 60s and at that point
bodybuilding was still in its infancy.

138
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,010
I mean,
up to up to the 1950s,

139
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:29,840
bodybuilding was actually a really
honorable profession. It was, it was pure.

140
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,330
There was no antibiotic steroids.
I mean,

141
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:34,640
they didn't even have so much
as a Flintstone vitamin. I mean,

142
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:37,700
there was no creatine or
protein powders and stuff.

143
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,520
What was the Diet like back then when,
when guys would like, try to get big?

144
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,490
Like did they have any idea of what the,
what the correct foods to eat?

145
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,420
Well, yeah, for sure. A lot more
emphasis was placed on health.

146
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,800
Health was always first with
a lot of these old, old, uh,
bodybuilders and, and um,

147
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,160
they called themselves physical is right

148
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,660
now. Jacqueline [inaudible]
was one of those guys.

149
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,780
Why have I first heard that
term from you actually from,

150
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:03,000
I believe it was reading your blog or,

151
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,600
or reading something that you had a
conversation that you'd had with someone,

152
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,860
but, uh, the, the term physical culture,
like being involved in physical culture.

153
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,670
I like that term. It's a good term, but
it's a throw back to ancient Greece.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,070
And then if you think about it,

155
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,490
the standard for male beauty and male
excellence for 2000 years was the ancient

156
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:23,400
Greek statue, the Greek God,
thank God. And you know,

157
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,610
if you look at the sculpture from
that time, it's just magnificent.

158
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,010
Something got very skewed right towards
the end of the sixties, early seventies.

159
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,320
And a lot of it was the anabolic steroids.
And you know, guys, let's, let's face it,

160
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,670
it's the human condition,
right?

161
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,950
If people will do things because they
can do things and people just wanted to

162
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:48,660
get as big and freaky as possible.
It's a bit of dysmorphia too, isn't it?

163
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,780
Isn't it sort of like,

164
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,460
like an anorexic that doesn't
realize there it's so skinny look in,

165
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:57,270
or a woman who has enormous fake press
and still doesn't think they're big

166
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:57,840
enough.

167
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,070
There's some sort of a weird psychological
condition where people can't see

168
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:05,550
themselves connect in there
somewhere where they, they, they,

169
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,530
they have a very skewed images, body
image of themselves. But, uh, yeah,

170
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:13,950
back in the 60s, it was pretty innocent
still. I mean, steroids existed,

171
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:18,270
but it wasn't prevalent.
Most of the information,

172
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,850
if you're looking for really good solid
information about sports training, uh,

173
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,630
you have to go before 1950. Really?
Yeah. Why is that? Well, I mean,

174
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:32,360
that's when steroids be, uh, began to
make inroads into Olympic weightlifting.

175
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,610
And of course that's when the eastern
block really started getting into this

176
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:38,790
stuff. Of course, it's not like, you
know, the u s didn't have, you know,

177
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,280
plenty of drugs too. Sure. But in those
days, you know, it was still legal, uh,

178
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,040
in the, in the early days. But you had
asked me about what the guys eat back,

179
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,450
the money mighty men of all just normal
food. It's just good basic food. Uh,

180
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,440
they drank a lot of milk.

181
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,330
Milk was considered a bodybuilding
food and you can trace that color back,

182
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:01,740
you know, thousands of years ago, even
into a India where they would, uh,

183
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,670
the Hindu wrestlers would
drink the milk and eat,

184
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,410
eat almonds in an effort to get
a build mass and their bodies.

185
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,840
So it's been well known.
Well everyone, you know,

186
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,160
talks about lactose intolerance
and things along those lines.

187
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:21,570
But a big issue with lactose intolerance
is just homogenized and pasteurized

188
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,840
milk. And you know, I've talked about
that in the podcast and people have said,

189
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,510
yeah, well if you don't do that,
people are going to get sick.

190
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:32,490
And that's not because of the milk. It's
because of the way we're raising cattle.

191
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,310
It's because of what we're
putting in these animals' diets.

192
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,490
It's because these aren't healthy animals
and if these aren't healthy animals

193
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,200
and the milk isn't treated properly,

194
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,980
if it does get somehow or
another contaminated by ECO
law or things along those

195
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:47,490
lines,
that's not because the milk is bad.

196
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,840
It's because somehow or another it
was handled poorly and people got sick

197
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,800
because of it.
But idea that

198
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,270
pasteurization and homogenization is
the only way to go with milk is really

199
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,610
ridiculous.
It kills all the enzyme.

200
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,520
It is ridiculous.
I mean,

201
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,180
people have been drinking milk literally
for thousands of years. I mean,

202
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:09,090
animal husband rate
goes back 10,000 years.

203
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,380
And to my way of thanking
the modern cow is just a,

204
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,290
I mean,
it's just a very sickly animal.

205
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,490
Even though they give these things
steroids and they give them all sorts of

206
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:27,540
antibiotics and, and all this
stuff, they're feeding them grain.

207
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,520
Cattle were never meant to eat grain.
They eat grass in the nature in the wild.

208
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,340
And then like you said,
you know,

209
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,150
you super heat the milk and you cook it
literally to death until there's nothing

210
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:43,230
left in it. No wonder people
have. And then on top of that,

211
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,400
people are drinking milk
combined with all others,

212
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,000
other kinds of stuff and overburdening
the digestive system, uh,

213
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,970
over drinking milk and you know, your
body be, develops an intolerance.

214
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,390
Yeah. People have this
aversion to bacteria. Uh,

215
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,140
but what folks have to get in their heads,

216
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:05,610
like this idea that
homogenization pasteurization
is the only way to go because

217
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,110
it kills all the bad stuff, but it also
kills the good stuff. I mean, sure,

218
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:12,690
you're going to get some protein,
calcium out of milk that's homogenize it,

219
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,680
pasteurize, but you're taking in
cultures, when you're drinking milk,

220
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:19,230
you're taking in a part
of that animal's body,

221
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,920
and the closer it is to being alive,
the better it is for your body.

222
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,820
That's why meat is supposed to
be consumed medium rare or rare.

223
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,560
Like that's the best way to eat meat.

224
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,070
You're going to get the most nutrition
out of that food when they're,

225
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:36,110
the only time you're supposed
to cook a, uh, like meat past.

226
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:39,660
That is when the animal
is assumed to be sick.

227
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,650
Like the reason why we cook pork to
150 degrees is to kill trick a gnosis.

228
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,300
And that's one of the reasons why with,
um, with factory pork or with, um,

229
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,880
you know, uh, what's the best word
for it? Farm pork or domestic pork.

230
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,840
Domestic pork. They're now saying that
you, they're lowering their standard.

231
00:13:57,841 --> 00:14:02,100
They're lowering it down to I believe
140 or 145 degrees because the incidences

232
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:04,380
of tricking osis are so rare.
In fact,

233
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:08,550
90% of all trick and osis cases in this
country come from eating bear meat.

234
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,320
Interesting. I've had their made by the
way, it's delicious. It was absolutely,

235
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:17,550
it was black bear, corn fed,
black bear corn fed the bear.

236
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:22,350
The bear had actually been living outside
this farmers field and a friend of

237
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:25,410
mine, uh, actually shot this thing and uh,

238
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,430
had prepared steaks and had told me,
hey listen,

239
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,950
I'm coming up to Philly to
train some Jujitsu with him.

240
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,140
This guy was a firearms expert.
He,

241
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,860
he actually taught farms for the FBI and
he used to take Brazilian Jujitsu with

242
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:41,310
me when I had my school in Philadelphia.
So I'm thinking, Oh my God,

243
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,470
bear state sends really sick man.

244
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,710
So I was trying to think of every excuse
for not eating it right. So he comes up,

245
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,940
he takes my wife out for shooting
lesson at the local range.

246
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,130
I in the meantime,

247
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,370
make some dinner for myself and then I'm
going to give them the excuse why I was

248
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:03,110
so hungry. I could wait. Right. So he's
so hurt. He's so hurt because you know,

249
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,110
he had made this specially for me. So
I says, Oh, what the hell, you know,

250
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:09,830
I'll have a bite dude.
It was absolutely delicious.

251
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,370
And then it was ashamed of myself. Like,
wow man, I wish I would have waited for,

252
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,410
you know,
so I saved it and had it the next night.

253
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,080
Yeah. Bear is very good for
you. Shockingly delicious.

254
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,080
You just have to make sure he cook it
correctly. Like a smoky beef. Yeah.

255
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,770
But I was also asked to make sure that
the animal hasn't been eating a lot of

256
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:28,440
fish. When they eat a lot
of fish, they can get funky.

257
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,980
Like if you eat bear or if he,

258
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:34,230
you catch a bear that's been eaten like
a rotten Mousse. And then for real, yeah,

259
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:35,220
any kind of Scavenger,

260
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,870
yeah, we're the scavenging
and so forth. But you know,

261
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,000
back to a quality of food and so forth.

262
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,650
An awful lot depends on a person's
ability to digest their food.

263
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,000
It's all comes back to digestion.
If you can't digest it,

264
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,470
then you can't assimilate it.

265
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,100
And a lot of the molecules of this
undigested food passes through the gut

266
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,470
membrane and creates this
inflammatory response in the body.

267
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,580
That's how these people are getting a
lot of their food intolerances and so

268
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:09,360
forth. When the digestion is in
line, your immune system is in wine,

269
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,270
you don't get sick bacteria
doesn't bother you. I mean the,

270
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,360
I in many cases when the immune
system is really, really strong, you,

271
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:22,730
you even fight off cases of worms
and all sorts of stuff. Your body is,

272
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,950
is amazing.
And his resilience.

273
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,770
Do you follow anything like a Gracie diet
or one of those things where you, uh,

274
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,980
don't combine foods to give your
digestive system a bit of a break?

275
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,740
Yeah, very much so. Uh, I was
originally introduced, uh,

276
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,460
to the Gracie diet by Horian Gracie,
the oldest son of Leo.

277
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,990
And then later Elio himself,

278
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,500
I spent some time with Leo actually stayed
down to his ranch for almost a month,

279
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:50,880
one time and Brazil. And Really? Wow.
That must have been amazing. Oh Man.

280
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,950
It was,
what year was this?

281
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,840
This was the year that hoist fought in
couple of Kabbalah and lost the villages.

282
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,530
Ah, okay. So that was probably
[inaudible] 96 [inaudible] 97. Yeah,

283
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,420
somewhere around there. Yeah. I want to
say maybe a little off might be 98 99.

284
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,710
Let's find out. Anyway, yeah, I forget.

285
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,400
But at any rate, uh, that's
when I was, became aware of
food combining. And then I,

286
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,000
I did a lot of research and reading
about it. I read about this guy,

287
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,670
Herbert Shelton,
who had a clinic in San Antonio,

288
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:24,410
Texas and cured a lot of people from a
lot of different diseases and sicknesses

289
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:29,360
using food combining and fasting.
So I got really, really interested.

290
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,330
And then later I read this guy,
Doctor John Tilden,

291
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,640
who wrote a book called toxemia explained.

292
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:39,641
He was a turn of the century physician
and he cured many so called incurable

293
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:43,310
diseases just through
diet and fasting alone.

294
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,380
And the basic premise is when you
over mix a lot of food in one meal,

295
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,630
there's a real tendency to overeat.
When you overeat,

296
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:55,050
you overburden your digestive system
and of course there's a real tendency to

297
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,790
put on body fat. So when you eat,
just let's say for example, uh,

298
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,900
I have a fruit based meal, a starch
based meal and a protein based meal.

299
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,560
Occasionally I'll have some
light dairy with the fruit,

300
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,420
but a lot of times it's just fruit butso
occasionally a little bit of nuts with

301
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:17,280
a starch meal I will usually stick stick
with something like a sweet potatoes or

302
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,280
potato, but occasionally I'll
have wheat based product.

303
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,560
I don't have any gluten
problems whatsoever,

304
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,980
mostly because of the way I combined
my foods and I can have that with some

305
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,060
vegetables and so forth.

306
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,410
And then I'll have a a protein meal and
all these meals are interchangeable.

307
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,940
I out of my protein meal for breakfast,

308
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:35,850
I could have my protein
meal for lunch and so forth.

309
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:39,390
And usually with the protein meal,
if it's really cold or I'm really hungry,

310
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:43,320
I'll have a little soup and I'll have
a raw leaf, green vegetable salad,

311
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,030
occasionally a couple
of cooked vegetables,

312
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,870
but basically meat and
vegetables and when I say meet,

313
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,740
I'm talking about fish
fowl, you know, all,

314
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:54,150
all of the type of flesh
foods and so forth.

315
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,160
And since adopting that I feel fantastic.
I'm like 61 years old now.

316
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,240
I still feel really good,
you know?

317
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,990
I've been able to maintain a really low
fat percentage and keep my energy and

318
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,780
health because traveling is brutal man.

319
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,840
I mean I'm in a different country every
couple a couple of weeks and as you got

320
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,830
flying can kick your ass man in a two hour
flight, 12 or if I, it doesn't matter,

321
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,700
it just really debilitating to fly.

322
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,440
Something about the air and the
I I radiation as well. Yeah,

323
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,930
the electromagnetic fields from the plane.

324
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,010
I mean there's a lot of stuff that's
hidden that people don't even realize they

325
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:39,390
can make flying pretty hard
in your system. But I do okay.

326
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,100
I really do.

327
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,040
The radiation thing, it's pretty
shocking. When I first started, uh,

328
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,440
someone was talking about x rays,
I said, all right, well let's,

329
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,750
let's look up how much
radiation x ray does.

330
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:51,950
Cause you have fucking airplanes
way more than x rays. And you know,

331
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:53,060
people do it all the time,

332
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,810
all the time and put those
poor stewardesses and flight
attendants and pilots.

333
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,900
I mean, those guys must be
beat down on a regular basis.

334
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,420
It's very a, your body, once again,
your immune system, when, when you're,

335
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,750
when you're eating in accordance with
nature and you're not overburdening the

336
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:11,090
system over burdening your
digestive system and so forth, uh,

337
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,480
your immune system is pretty strong.

338
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,010
Your body can handle just about anything
really, but it does make you tired.

339
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,750
It can make you quite tired.
So rest becomes really important.

340
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,160
And I don't know about you,

341
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:26,670
but like I know you fly all
over the place to do your, uh,

342
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,230
your comedy act and so forth.
And, uh, I find that if,

343
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,040
if I rest up really well and
don't do anything too strenuous,

344
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,540
I bounced back pretty quick.

345
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,650
I find that I'm also, um, I
have to exercise when I land,

346
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,970
when I land, that's my, my secret to
avoiding the real feelings of jet lag.

347
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,890
I get to the gym,

348
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,070
I hit the elliptical machine and I just
do a hard half an hour on the elliptical

349
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,640
machine.

350
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,290
Just something about it forces my body
into that sort of recovery response and

351
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,790
that kicks everything up a notch and just
seems to really help keep my energy at

352
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,840
high levels when I fly.

353
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,990
But depending on what
time of the day, oh, am a,

354
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,560
what am I sacred for making the
transition. The second I get on the plane,

355
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,440
I reset my watch to whatever
times they're not going to be yet.

356
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,110
Sometimes I'm flying many times zones.

357
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,560
And then I immediately tried to adapt
my eating plan to the place and gone,

358
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,260
which means often skipping a meal.
Uh,

359
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,760
occasional I'll even fast and not just
drink water the whole time on the plane

360
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:30,300
and donating. And I figure it's a
low activity anyway. And then, um,

361
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,990
the second event, I'm like, you, if
it's in the early part of the day,

362
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,440
I'll take a nice walk.
I,

363
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:41,080
I do this thing called Russian breathing
matters where I worked the breath. Uh,

364
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,310
it's fantastic. It's, you
matched the, the, uh, the inhale,

365
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:46,690
exhale to your steps,

366
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,400
and you see how many steps you can get
up to on the inhale and how many steps

367
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,360
you can get it on the exhale.

368
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,770
So you might be taking like 20 steps in
one inhale and actually having over 20

369
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,120
steps and you'll keep that going.

370
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,200
That's really interesting. Um, I do
something similar in the isolation tank.

371
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,850
Just to, to clarify what I said
earlier, I was an incorrect, uh,

372
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,100
it's actually the same as an x ray, a
seven hour flight from New York to London.

373
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:13,360
You received the same dose of radiation
as a chest x ray from New York,

374
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,170
New York to Tokyo. It's two chest x rays.
So that's where I had gotten it wrong.

375
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,420
So, you know, six, seven hour
flight, it's like an x ray.

376
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,790
I mean, like when you go to the
dentist, right? You always see the, uh,

377
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,860
the hygienist jumped behind the curtain.

378
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,760
She doesn't want to be when you're
supposed to just doing this extra right.

379
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,550
Horrible is x Ray. But you didn't ever
see her in the room with you, man.

380
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,630
It's covering your balls
and your, your, your, your,

381
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,830
your chest and thyroid with,
with that, that shield.

382
00:22:39,831 --> 00:22:43,590
So obviously it's not as harmless,

383
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,930
especially if you think about poor
pilots, you know, I mean that's,

384
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:50,750
that's pretty crazy when you really stop
and think about it. It's pretty nuts.

385
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:54,230
Oh Man. So you were, it was 98,

386
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,570
which says hoist Gracie's
will lead Ishmael fight. Um,

387
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,770
so you went down there in 1998 you
stayed for a month with Elio Gracie.

388
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:03,740
So folks who don't know,

389
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,840
Helio Gracie is one of the most important
figures in the history of martial arts,

390
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:12,350
if not the most important.
Him and Carlos Gracie, uh,

391
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,490
essentially created what we
call modern Brazilian Jujitsu.

392
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:18,350
They started the revolution.

393
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,010
And since then there's been
a lot of innovation and a
lot of change and a lot of

394
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:26,750
growth since that time, since the, you
know, the 1940s and 50s. And sixties,

395
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:29,870
and the on through the Hixson hoists,
you know,

396
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:33,860
all these guys that came up
afterwards, you know, through the 90s.

397
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:36,680
And then once the ultimate fighting
championship came around, boy,

398
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:41,330
it just skyrocketed.
Now Jujitsu and your son Max is a really,

399
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,880
Zack, excuse me, exact
Maxwell, excuse me. Zach, um,

400
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,110
fought and metamorris. Yeah. Yeah, he,
uh, wow. He really did a terrific job.

401
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:51,720
That kid was Tuffy flats.
That's Sean Roberts. Yeah.

402
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,740
That guy's like a real submission machine.
So, you know, I was a little nervous,

403
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,430
but that is slick. He's slick,
very relaxed guy. But you know,

404
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:04,431
he was one of the first generation of
American children to grow up in the

405
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,080
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu system. I started
him when he was really just a little,

406
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,010
you know,
uh,

407
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,670
when I was laughing when chrom is talking
about the invisible Jujitsu, you know,

408
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,470
more like invisible
pressure. Well, I wasn't,

409
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,790
so I started with the pressure
I put on poor Zach, but he,

410
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,980
he really, uh, he grew
up in that whole system.

411
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,850
Was that because of like the way your
father pushed you into wrestling?

412
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,690
Uh, probably, you know, it
was not conscious thing.

413
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,670
I had a little bit of that little egg
syndrome going on there and uh, maybe, uh,

414
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,750
maybe looking to, you
know, live some type of,

415
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,010
get some type of fulfillment
through my kids. You know,

416
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,490
I mean there was all that crap going on.

417
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,150
Well, I have girls, but a, I teach them
Jujitsu, but I make it fun. You know,

418
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:53,290
I have them arm bar me and just show
them where to put their legs and how to

419
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,980
pull and how to, you know, how to set up
the position. And I showed them the mount.

420
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,910
But what's really fascinating is,
you know what,

421
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:03,670
you're familiar with the concept that
there's certain things that get passed on

422
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,550
through genetics. In fact, uh,

423
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,590
they've proven that with certain mice
that they can take mice and they can

424
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,543
institute,

425
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,770
they put a smell in the air and when
that smell happens and you're like a

426
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:21,760
citrusy smell, they'll give it an
electrical shock to the feet of the mice.

427
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,590
Like they have what they're
standing on this thing.

428
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,700
And when they smelled this smell, the
zap their feet not did not to kill them,

429
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:31,390
you know, just enough to like
make them like realize like,
Yikes, this is not good.

430
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,080
Their children with no
electricity whatsoever,

431
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,850
smell that smell and a panic ensues.
They have a panic response.

432
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,110
So it's passed on through their
genetics. Cellular memory. Yes.

433
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,650
My three year old when
her and my four year old,

434
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,800
well heard my five year
old started rolling around,

435
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,370
the three year old would take
the back and go over under, okay.

436
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,500
She throws the hooks in and she goes
like this and she hangs on. I was like,

437
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,160
that's crazy. I was like, she's,
it's almost like instinct.

438
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,120
Like they were rolling around and um,

439
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,200
the older daughter like turned sideways
and the three year old went like this

440
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,400
and then through her legs over. And
I was like, that is fucking crazy.

441
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,560
Because she did what I've
done probably 100,000 times,

442
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,480
you know, but it's in my mind, you
see the back, you get that over under,

443
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,620
you throw the hooks on.
I mean,

444
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:30,250
it's just instinctively so to see a
little three year old immediately do it.

445
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:32,410
I'm like,
I wonder if that's in their genes.

446
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,930
I wonder if that has somehow
or another had been passed on.

447
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,860
I made, we will never know,
but it's an interesting theory.

448
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,350
We May in our lifetime, I mean, we may,

449
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,200
they may be able to say they might
be able to figure that luminate

450
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,980
that human beings are natural.

451
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,300
Grapplers all mammals are
grapplers. I mean, even Orca,

452
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,070
we'll wrestle sharks.
There was an amazing film in New Zealand,

453
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,630
have some tourists that uh,
uh,

454
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,370
there was a female worker with her
calf training the calf, how to hunt.

455
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,690
She grabbed,

456
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,560
she hit a great white from underneath
and stunned it and grabbed it and turned

457
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:12,120
it over. Sharks need to continuously
move in order to breathe.

458
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,570
When they turn over,
for some reason they go dos owl.

459
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,150
So she held it upside down
until it drowned and then he,

460
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,520
then they ate the liver.
Once again. Grapplers man,

461
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,850
if you think about it in nature,
prey animals,

462
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,430
our strikers and predators are crap.

463
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:34,110
Where's the short cats would have cats
do immediately they get ahold of the neck

464
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,960
and then they dive under the
go to full guard. You know,

465
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,840
I mean that's super common
in the cap world. Yeah.

466
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,690
There's a crazy video of a lion,

467
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:47,620
a female lion killing a Willdabeast and a,
the way she kills the will to be,

468
00:27:47,621 --> 00:27:52,530
it's not a wildebeest. Um, with
those pig looking things, not,

469
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:55,190
oh, it was a wart hog. Yeah. I
guess the Lord Her rock. Sure. Yeah.

470
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,620
Crazy looking at Tuskegee.
But she,

471
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,850
she dives on it. She bites his neck
and then she rolls under it. I mean,

472
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:07,200
she pulls garden this wart hog and then
slowly chokes it out and kills it by

473
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,160
holding onto its neck.

474
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:12,450
And it's fascinating to watch because
it's totally lik watching Jujitsu. I was,

475
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:15,480
I was in ballet and I
stayed right across the, uh,

476
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,060
the road from the monkey sanctuary and
the place where I was staying in bally,

477
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,130
uh, the monkeys was just overrun
the place a couple of times a day.

478
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:26,120
The whole troop and just come walking
through hundreds of them writers, man,

479
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,540
he's got us scary.
Don't leave your iPhone laying around you,

480
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,450
your room key or anything cause little
suckers will grab it and then you get to,

481
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,320
you have to bribe them to get it back.

482
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,290
But as watch these that
happened with you and that,

483
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,190
well I almost got my iPhone but uh,
I,

484
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,130
I would be working on my iPad a lot of
times cause I make my living to a online

485
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:46,710
personal training, uh,
aside from seminars.

486
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,950
So I'd always be working at the wee
hours in the morning when this monkey

487
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:50,784
trooper come through.

488
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,570
So I bought like just one of these cheap
little wooden slingshots and you know,

489
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:56,130
you don't even have to
shoot at the monkey.

490
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:58,710
You just pull it back and they
start to scream and run away.

491
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,100
They're smart enough to know like,
I guess enough people are shot at him,

492
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:05,430
you know, said they would take
off and leave me alone. But uh,

493
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,360
I would watch these young bunkies
wrestling and my God, it was Jujitsu.

494
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,170
They were using the guard. They put the
feet in the hips, it flip each other over.

495
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:14,110
They would go to the bank.

496
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,720
It was really fun to watch the little
suckers doing Jujitsu with each other in

497
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:22,800
the morning. And of course they use the
neck bite like, like you know, like a cat.

498
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,790
And you ever seen the
documentary grizzly man? I,

499
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:32,760
I saw the one part where the, the bears
going on it. Yeah. Fascinating. Yeah,

500
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,550
the documentary, the whole
thing. Oh, it's incredible.

501
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,880
It's one of my favorite dog was Werner
Herzog. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah,

502
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,010
I did see part of that. I
kept thinking to myself, the

503
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,150
hotel, what does this guy thank you
man. You're just, you're just a meal.

504
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,910
He was crazy. He had a lot
of issues for sure. I mean,

505
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,520
as you delve deep into the documentary,

506
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:56,970
all these different people from his past
are talking about how crazy was. Uh,

507
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,270
it's uh, it's actually an
unintentionally hilarious documentary.

508
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,560
It's really quite funny.
But when the bears are going
at it, it's a full Jujitsu.

509
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,240
It just full guard. The bag gets side
control at one point. I mean it's,

510
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,050
and then the other bear hip escapes and
gets back to guard. I mean it's, he, it's,

511
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,490
it's crazy.
I mean you watch how they're doing it.

512
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:20,310
It's like these bears are using a
form of Jujitsu. It's very similar.

513
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,130
Back in the 70s,
I uh,

514
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,240
went down to Atlantic city and I
used to be really into arm wrestling.

515
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:30,090
It was but actually pretty good.
And I actually won the, uh,

516
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,030
the East Coast resort championship in
Atlantic city. My weight in Ann Arbor,

517
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:39,440
that was college wrestler at the time.
I wrestled a division one Ncaa and uh,

518
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,840
did a lot of straight training
in those days and uh, the, the,

519
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,200
the halftime entertainment was victor the
wrestling bear and do you remember the

520
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:52,920
karate guy movie guys?
Tank Guy? Joe Has No,

521
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,160
he was fairly well known a
martial arts guy at the time.

522
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:58,920
He did a lot of Hollywood's
not work and so forth. Anyway,

523
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,230
he went out to wrestle Fichter,

524
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:06,150
the wrestling bear and it was amazing
how this bear would use single leg take

525
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:07,200
downs.
Really.

526
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:12,180
It would grab him behind the Achilles and
put his big old bare shoulder and head

527
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:14,730
against the thigh to take him down.

528
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,600
It was just really amazing to
watch this bear go to work.

529
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,980
Like he actually had moves or something
and he would go for a low single,

530
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,570
he met and he would take this big, this
guy probably weighed about two 40 to 50.

531
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,340
This Joe has and have you saw him,
you'd probably recognize it.

532
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:32,760
He used to play a henchman and a
lot of movies and stuff. Anyway,

533
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:33,361
he was threatened.

534
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:37,320
This Joe has around and this was this
like a little black bear and then people

535
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:39,810
could wrestle the bear, you
know, uh, if they want it to.

536
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,410
The bear was muzzled of course.
And uh, it was really amazing, man.

537
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,260
You had to cover the bears
clause with anything.

538
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,620
Yeah, they had like a little
pads around the cause,

539
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,300
but you had no chance against his bare
man. I mean, no, no chance whatsoever.

540
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,980
Frighteningly strong. This animal
was, and it was really funny to watch.

541
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,270
Yeah.
The comparison there,

542
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,650
the relative comparison of strength
between a person and in animals.

543
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,000
It's ridiculous. We had a two
year old chimp on, um, uh,

544
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,340
news radio. This show
though is on, once we had,

545
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,290
I don't even think we
ever used it on the show.

546
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,240
I think it was one of those scenes.
It just got cut.

547
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,950
But the chimp was hanging around the
set and the chimp trainer and they were

548
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:20,280
explaining to me how you
can only have babies.

549
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,940
Like you can't have like
a grown adult male chimp,

550
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,030
like that crazy lady in Connecticut.
Like they don't do their face in.

551
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,780
And it wasn't her,
it was her friend,

552
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,400
her friend got got attacked by the champ.

553
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:38,160
But the woman who was keeping
this chimp was fucking insane.

554
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,010
Cause trainers even do that.
They

555
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,490
don't spend time alone with these things
because they're fucking dangerous.

556
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,331
They are dangerous.

557
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:47,810
And then they start to think and act
like they're human because they'd been

558
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,490
humanized.
And uh,

559
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:54,050
there's been cases where some of the
animals become sexually aggressive towards

560
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:56,340
the females magic as a,

561
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:01,570
it's basically a teenage mammo
and they don't have any outlet.

562
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:03,070
I mean, it's crazy. Yeah.

563
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,780
They don't have any sexual outlet
other than masturbation or frogs.

564
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:08,300
If they catch a frog. So you want to
catch a frog and they fuck a frog.

565
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,440
It's like 98 should have the
same genetics, 98% the leaders.

566
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:17,030
So they're going to have a lot of crazy
human characteristics and no morals,

567
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,450
ethics, no, you know,

568
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,890
they don't understand the concept
of doing someone harm. They,

569
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,740
it doesn't even mean anything to them.

570
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,420
But this two year old chimp that we had
was on my back and just plain with me,

571
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:32,500
just like smacking me like every now
and then, like just joking around,

572
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,570
I was like, this is freaky. How
strong this thing is. Crazy.

573
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:37,100
It's only like this big,
you know,

574
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:40,520
it was this little tiny thing and I was
holding it and it was like hanging on to

575
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:44,630
me and then it would like rotate on me
and then it like, like slap my back.

576
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:48,770
And I was like, Jesus Christ, this
little baby could probably fucked me up,

577
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,170
you know, and an imagined a
gorilla. Oh, I was, um, I was,

578
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:54,740
uh,

579
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,770
part of, uh, uh, Arthur Jones had,

580
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:02,650
or the inventor of Nautilus had a
ranch down in Florida and he was a,

581
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,690
he,
he used to be a animal hunter and trapper.

582
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:10,000
He used to catch the animals for
zoos. He had, um, white rhinos. Uh,

583
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,500
he has a huge herd of, uh, the, the
biggest, yeah. Yeah. This was in, uh,

584
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,860
Lake Helen,
Florida.

585
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,140
He had his big a nautilus medical sports
industries down there and, uh, you know,

586
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:26,000
he, he owns giant jumbo
airlines, airplanes.

587
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,790
He was a pilot and a,
I mean, it was crazy.

588
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,710
He had the biggest
private herd of elephants,

589
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,440
so he would fly them in on planes.

590
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,820
Uh, he, my, my father was a, a inspector
for the Federal Department of Agriculture.

591
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,010
He actually inspected Jones
elephants when they were,

592
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,120
that's how I got to go down to
the ranch and meet Arthur Jones.

593
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,740
I wouldn't even imagine you'd get
a fucking elephant on a plane. Uh,

594
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:51,180
they had those big cargo Jetson.
They would fly this military style.

595
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,710
Wow. Okay. That makes sense. And He,
uh, it was not a movie dumbo drop,

596
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,490
something like that.
But he was a,

597
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,980
he had was an elephant hunter at one
point and it felt pretty bad about

598
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,880
slaughtering elephants. So he decided
to do some conservation work. And, uh,

599
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,310
but at any rate, he had a, a peck
relo named Mickey and a this Mickey,

600
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,290
they actually a sedated at one time.

601
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,500
I put it on an old nautilus pullover
machines. It's pretty funny picture.

602
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,110
I actually, I had it in my gym at
one point, this gorilla, but a,

603
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:24,210
I saw Mickey throw a fit with its trainer
one time and a throw a head of cabbage

604
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,150
at the guy because it was pissed
off about something, I don't know,

605
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,840
but hit the guy in the head
and knocked him out. Wow.
Just a head of cabbage, dude.

606
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,180
Imagine the power. Maybe the guy
had a glass straw. I don't know.

607
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,010
It looked to me like it's
the side of the head,

608
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,530
but wow. Knocked this guy out, man. Yeah,

609
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:45,230
I bet it was 300 miles an hour for
sure. Man. That made you didn't win.

610
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,440
Not Win. I mean, it just gave you the idea
of just how powerful these animals are.

611
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:49,810
Bins.
Yeah.

612
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:54,000
We can't even wrap my head around what
an 800 pound primate would be like.

613
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,600
That's the kind of strength that they
would have. It would just be ridiculous.

614
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,840
A chimpanzee. They say that a
hundred is this him right here?

615
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,890
That Sam right there. The photo up
there on the screen. That's it. Wow.

616
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,830
I can't believe that guy can't blend
that picture. Nice research man.

617
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,520
Powerful Google. I actually
had that, uh, that poster. Oh,

618
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,430
imma gym at one point they say that a
chimp is 150 pound champ is supposed to

619
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:24,030
have the strength of a 500 pound man.
So what does an 800 pound gorilla?

620
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,730
I have the strength by God.
It's just unfathomable. Yeah.

621
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,780
They purchased tear you apart. Just
pull you pretty much. Pretty much.

622
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,110
You just have to wonder about these
researchers laying out there in the grass

623
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,390
with these things. It
does. Oh, stands still.

624
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,290
When they bluffed charge you, you cannot
move, man. You have to stand still. It's

625
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,390
too much for me, man. Oh well, you know,

626
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:51,510
they didn't even know the gorillas
were real until the early 19 hundreds.

627
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,550
It was just a legend. They, there was
a recent discovery as far as like,

628
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,240
uh, you know, uh,

629
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,520
biologists would just hear about these
things that lived in the jungles,

630
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,000
but they didn't have any real
evidence of mountain gorillas until,

631
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,250
I think it was like 19,
10 or something like that.

632
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:11,100
And they finally started seeing
them and taking photographs of them.

633
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,460
Do you imagine the first person to stumble
across a fucking gorilla and realize

634
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:17,550
that's a real thing? Blow your mind,
man. A hundred years ago he said,

635
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,840
those guys in those days,

636
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:21,660
they were into trophy hunting and they
probably just shoot the hell out of these

637
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,030
things. They're, they're pretty
peaceful from what I understand. I mean,

638
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:25,540
they let you alone.
Yeah.

639
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,190
There's a lot of trophy hunters now
reclusive and all that. You know,

640
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,410
what was really amazing to me, why
is that? The chimpanzees, uh, there,

641
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,560
they commit murder and rape and the
different tribes actually hunt each other

642
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:41,720
and they're cannibals. They're not the
cute little things that you, uh, they're,

643
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,730
they're nasty little guys.
That's another thing about chimps.

644
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:47,730
They didn't find out until the
90s that they even ate meat. Yeah.

645
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,800
They're omnivores. Just pretty much,
well, like I said, 98% of our, uh,

646
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,740
of our DNA because that's the crazy
thing about guerrilla sit there.

647
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:59,160
Not Gorillas are huge, enormous, muscular,

648
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,380
be super aggressive, giant
canines, the sprouts and shit,

649
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,630
bamboo, bamboo. Why they had that
enzyme where they can process,

650
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,640
uh, the, the cellulose, one thing
that differentiates us from,

651
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:18,840
let's say a lot of other, uh,
let's say like a sheep cattle,

652
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,590
but even gorillas, they have a digestive
enzyme that breaks down cellulose.

653
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,730
Human beings do not.

654
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,990
That's why a lot of people that go into
veganism and tried to do all raw food

655
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:30,120
diets don't do so well.
You can,

656
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,240
a human beings cannot process cellulose.

657
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:36,130
So all the nutrients that are bound and

658
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,180
the cellulose fiber cannot be
absorbed or assimilated into the body.

659
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,200
So we have to do things like cook food.
You know,

660
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,870
like Broccoli for example,
is completely on digestible,

661
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,790
but yet you see it in every salad bar

662
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,550
really. So when you eat broccoli raw,
it's as you're just doing nothing,

663
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,600
you're not getting much. It becomes
a digestive irritant. Really.

664
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,780
Same thing with call a fire. That's
why they should be cooked or steamed.

665
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,200
So you know, to break down the
cellulose or you can juice them.

666
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,870
The high speed juicing process,

667
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,140
you take the cellulose out of there and
then you get the nutrients and so forth.

668
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,350
Do you cold press juice?
You ever, you ever have cold
press juice? Well, you know,

669
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,020
guys, I'm on the road. I don't have
kitchen implements and so forth,

670
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:17,940
but for sure I would if you know,
if, uh, if I had a permanent set up.

671
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,611
Yeah,

672
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:23,050
there's a company near me that the cells
cold pressed juices and cod are so good

673
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,820
and they're, I mean, this company, they
have like cabbage and all these W. I mean,

674
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:29,590
they don't taste the best,
but God damn,

675
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:33,670
you just feel the nutrients when you drink
it. It's like your body just goes yes.

676
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,730
You know, like it does it a little
Diego Sanchez. Yes. Cartwheel.

677
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,320
And when you drink it, yeah.
Guy's a character. You,

678
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,490
I worked with them down at the university
to Jujitsu. What a, what a great,

679
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,570
well you got him in probably with the
best shape of his life when he fought Bj

680
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,403
Penn for the title

681
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,170
amazing shape. I mean Bj is an
incredible fighter. Let's face it.

682
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,530
His skill set is just like amazing.
And uh,

683
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,490
the only thing that was probably keeping
Diego and his feet in that fight was

684
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:02,530
the fact that he was just
in such a superb shape.

685
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,730
It would have been more merciful if he
wouldn't have been at shape because then

686
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:09,370
he could have just got knocked out.
I mean it,

687
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,430
it was really bad that cuts
and so forth that he, he got,

688
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,790
well the cut is what stopped it and that
was a big hit. It was just awful. Man.

689
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,220
His face was really laid open.
It was very sad.

690
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,270
Yeah.
He got caught early in that fight too.

691
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:25,271
He got hurt like moments into the first
with a right hand and then it's just,

692
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,380
I don't know.
I mean even if he wasn't in shape,

693
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:31,860
Diego's just got such an incredible will.
I mean, I don't think I ever seen, man,

694
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,130
I don't think I've ever seen a
guy with a wheel that strong.

695
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,170
I've never seen a guy able to push
himself to such an nth degree.

696
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,000
A picture of him.
He looked fantastic in that fight to get,

697
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,900
it doesn't look like that now.
Oh No.

698
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,090
Well maybe trying a little bit different
way or he just doesn't look as muscular

699
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:50,460
as strong. You know, he's, uh,
he's, he's, he's smaller now.

700
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,570
I think maybe he's sacrificed a little
bit of a muscle mass for maybe more

701
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:55,404
cardio,

702
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,390
but he's also fluctuated back and forth
now more like he's done a few fights at

703
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,430
one 17, like with Jake Ellenberger,
Martin Kampmann and then he's,

704
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:06,300
he's gone down to 55 and
he goes back and forth.

705
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,060
He actually said that
before his last fight,

706
00:41:09,061 --> 00:41:13,490
he ate some bad beef tar
tar and got sick. And, uh,

707
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,990
that he had like some sort of
a food poisoning that sapped
him of his, uh, his, uh,

708
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,390
strength, um, before the miles
jury fight his last fight.

709
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,200
I thought that was crazy that
he would eat beef tar tar like,

710
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,010
like right before he fought like a
major UFC fight without knowing like the

711
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:33,210
source of things. You ate it at like
a hotel, you know, he was in Vegas,

712
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,750
well been a long time
wrestling competitor.

713
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,770
I arrested all through the sixties and
seventies and then later I got into

714
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,940
Brazilian Jujitsu.

715
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,770
I was very animate about never
eating anything different,

716
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,310
you know, when it came within
a day or so with the fight.

717
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,660
So I would never experiment or eat
anything unusual or no way, ma'am.

718
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,840
Yeah, I think I would think Diego
would. I think it was Dallas. Actually.

719
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:59,540
None of the think about it though. I
don't think it wasn't Vegas, but you know,

720
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:02,840
I was shocked that he would do
that. Eat Beef Tartar. I mean,

721
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:05,090
that's a risky thing to eat too.
Raw beef.

722
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,270
Well, he just don't know
these hotels. I mean,

723
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:11,610
what you're going to get and these
restaurants and so forth. Uh,

724
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:16,780
usually when I travel, I try to
use air BNB, air BNB, airbnb.

725
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,570
What's that? Uh, it's a website where
you can rent a little apartments or,

726
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,100
or even a little cottages and houses and
they're all over the world and bed and

727
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,630
breakfasts and breakfast B
and B. Dot com. Fantastic. Uh,

728
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:34,100
uh, uh, so much cheaper than hotels.

729
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,600
Plus you don't have to go broke going
out to dinner all the time in restaurants

730
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:42,650
and so forth because usually these
places have stoves or ovens and you know,

731
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:45,380
you can cook. Sometimes you will clock
out and have a blender or something,

732
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:47,170
you know, and I mean,
wow, it's really good.

733
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:49,310
You can buy your stuff and bring it back.

734
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,131
Oh,
that's nice.

735
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:54,720
So you go and go to a grocery store
that's got to make a huge difference when

736
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:55,220
you're traveling.

737
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,360
Like I do. Yeah, that's tricky
right out a lot. But, uh,

738
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,110
it now what they kind of died
I have is really not that hard.

739
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,650
A lot of times I'll just go to
grocery stores and so forth and, and,

740
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:08,490
and by the food and bring it
back. I find, believe it or not,

741
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,380
in Europe and even Russia.
I was just in Russia not too long ago.

742
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,470
Uh, the food is superior to what we
have in the United States. Really. Uh,

743
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,370
they don't have agribusiness there.
You know,

744
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,110
if you go into an average
supermarket in the United States,

745
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,720
you'll see all the fruit.
It's perfect.

746
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:31,230
It's all waxy and shiny and everything's
lined up. And then of course,

747
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,420
unless you go into it like
an organic place, you know,

748
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:36,810
like whole foods or something.
But if you're not buying
organic produce, you know,

749
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:38,820
the produce always looks a uniform.

750
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,350
It's a pretty and but it tastes
kind of like cardboard in Europe.

751
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,370
It looks like they just pick the apples
off someone out of someone's backyard.

752
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,390
I mean sometimes they'll have like holes
and they're irregular shaped and I mean

753
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,160
it just looks like, you know, like fruit,

754
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:55,560
you pick off a tree and
absolutely delicious.

755
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,950
You go down the aisle of a US supermarket,

756
00:43:58,951 --> 00:44:00,570
let's just take the
cereal aisle for example.

757
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,130
You might have like 80 choices there.

758
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,860
You might have like five or six people
don't overeat like we do here in the

759
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:10,980
states. And the food is much
simpler but really delicious.

760
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,120
It's not hard to feed yourself.
And your,

761
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,250
so the vegetables are closer to like,
like heirloom tomatoes.

762
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,040
That's a type of thing and you
can taste the difference. Boy,

763
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:22,500
have you ever had folks who've
never had an heirloom tomatoes?

764
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:26,070
The tomatoes that we have in stores today?
Um,

765
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:29,970
a lot of times what you're getting is
these genetically modified tomatoes that

766
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:33,810
are surviving for periods of time since
they've been picked to the time that you

767
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:37,230
eat them. They can last weeks and
weeks and weeks, which is not normal.

768
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,010
I grow tomatoes and if I take one of my
tomatoes and I pick it and then I put it

769
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,370
on my counter in a couple of days, it
starts getting funky. That's right.

770
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,210
You want to eat it quick, you want
to pick it and eat it within days.

771
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,670
But these store bought tomatoes that
you're getting, you know where the,

772
00:44:51,671 --> 00:44:55,380
that have been modified. They're
pale and they're hard and they like,

773
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,310
they can take a beating, a
regular tomatoes, that kind
of a mushy fruit. It does.

774
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,830
They don't really,
they don't stay from that long.

775
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,330
A lot of the nutrients and so
forth, there's just not there. Yeah,

776
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,090
they're grounded
nutritionally depleted soil.

777
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,470
They're harvested early so that
they have a longer shelf life.

778
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,160
They're genetically modified. And I
like apples for example, you know,

779
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,830
they had these storage
apples and you know,

780
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:22,140
people are eating apples
during the winter and so forth.

781
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:24,510
But I mean these things
are like really old.

782
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:28,020
I mean they'd been around in storage,
cold storage.

783
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,150
They're not getting the nutrients like
they could if they were eating in season.

784
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,900
Yeah. I've started over
the last couple of years,

785
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,760
started growing my own food and
growing my own food and my own eggs.

786
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,140
That's a big one. I have my own chickens
and uh, I mean these chickens are pets.

787
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:47,870
Like my, my three year old daughter
picks him up and she can carry them.

788
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,600
I mean their pets and they
run around the yard. They,

789
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,650
the grass and worms and the food,
they table scraps too,

790
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,200
which is great because food that,
you know,

791
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,040
we'd necessarily might not eat,
you know, you scrape a plate off.

792
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,440
It doesn't have to look pretty, you
know, like leftovers. You know, W we,

793
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:08,060
we do eat leftovers and we will see them
and put them back in the frigerator.

794
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:11,210
But like the stuff that's just sort of
like a little bit left on your plate,

795
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,210
we'll just take a little bit of
that like from everybody's plate,

796
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,180
put it on a plate, put it out there
for the chickens. They go nuts for it.

797
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,280
But you know, we don't feed them
chicken of course, but you know,

798
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,130
we'll feed them beef and we'll feed
them vegetables and you know, they'll,

799
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,650
they'll eat all sorts of different things.

800
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,000
It was like, yeah, let Gracie's
farm Antares op was, you know,

801
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:31,920
he lived up in the hills and he had his
own farm and he had his own Checketts

802
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,000
that were free range. They would bring
the eggs in. He had his own herd of cows.

803
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:40,440
They're just grass fed. He would milk
those cows every day from the raw.

804
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,910
He used to big me. He knew I liked milk.
You bring me a picture. So frothy from,

805
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,720
for the cows teat set it on
the table for me to drink.

806
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:52,080
That would be my breakfast.
A liter of raw cow milk. Wow.

807
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,540
He would make cheese from that milk,

808
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,490
his own brand of cheese with no
salt or anything. Just like a,

809
00:46:58,491 --> 00:47:03,420
a fresh non age type cheese. Uh,
he would go down to the pond.

810
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:08,750
He had his big spring fed pond where
he would fish catch the fish for that

811
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:12,990
night. Uh, vegetables were grown
in a garden. Uh, he, you know,

812
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:16,260
you hear about these ass drinks, you
know, most of them are just sugar water,

813
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:20,340
just frozen sugar water.
[inaudible] he buy in the supermarket.

814
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:24,190
Yeah, I saw he's a berry, a
Brazilian bury the squat on Ah,

815
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,210
that has this sort of, uh, it's, it's
kind of a stimulant effect to it.

816
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,590
Streamline, uh, uh, high and all
sorts of nutrients and so forth.

817
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:37,000
Antioxidants, it taste really bitter.
It's not a, it's not a sweet fruit.

818
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:42,270
He would pick the sie off the tree and
come in and actually literally juice as I

819
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:47,650
write there for, excuse me, fresh on
the spot. It was amazing, man. You know,

820
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:52,000
there's coconuts. It was these little
tiny bananas he would get. I mean,

821
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,720
he was basically living off off the
land, you know, it was really cool.

822
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:57,190
I think the only thing they would buy,

823
00:47:57,191 --> 00:47:58,900
they would have rice
and stuff occasionally,

824
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:03,340
but for the most part he was just living
off the food that he produced on his

825
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:07,540
farm. I want to do that self sufficient,
man. That's my ultimate goal. I mean,

826
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,810
I'm slowly working my way towards that
by growing a bunch of food around the

827
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:14,530
house. But it's, that's,
that's the solution mean I
thought about it, I was like,

828
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:18,100
everybody wants all these things.
Everybody wants, I want a boat. You know,

829
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:20,350
I want a vacation home. I
wanted this. And I'm like,

830
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:25,090
how many people that have money ever
raise their own food? No one ever says,

831
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:25,600
Hey,

832
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,740
I'm going to take this money and I'm
going to invest in a patch of land and in

833
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:32,880
soil and farming tools
and the, you know, the,

834
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:36,850
the heirloom seeds and I'm going to grow
my own food. Nobody fucking does that.

835
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:41,050
It's, it's a weird thing. People's
priorities are very skewed, very skewed,

836
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,730
and said, well, you know, like with my own
example, I mean I wasn't always this way,

837
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:49,860
but uh, I, everything I own
is in one 65 liter, beck,

838
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,550
one 65 liter bags in the trunk of the car.
How big is 65 liters?

839
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,240
It's about maybe like 14 inches
high by about 28 inches long.

840
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,630
Wow. And that's it. It wasn't always that
way. Of course, I had the four story,

841
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:08,180
Brad Stone House it filet and
the, you know, Jim and the,

842
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:13,270
the first Brazilian Jujitsu Academy in
the, the eastern seaboard Max her size.

843
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:16,630
Right. Matricide. Even beforehand. I
heard about that place back in the day.

844
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:20,140
But you are one of the first American
black belts. I was one of the,

845
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,450
I don't know what the ranking,
but it's certainly one of the early one.

846
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:28,120
What year did you get your black belt?
2000 from Helson Gracie, Hawaii. And then,

847
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:30,330
um, I was voice Gracie's, uh,

848
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,190
training a trainer for his first.

849
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,870
So you got your black belt when
you and your late forties? Uh, I,

850
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,740
I did 48 years old.
I'm 61 now.

851
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:45,070
So what was 2000 so it was what, 58. Wow.

852
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:48,920
So when you were training down at a
elios place, you were still brown belt?

853
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,580
I was a purple belt. Purple Belt. Wow. And
it was, you get invited to go down there?

854
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,990
I was with voice as his trainer.
I was trying to prep him for the village.

855
00:49:57,991 --> 00:49:58,840
He fight.
Oh,

856
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:02,200
so you're a strength and conditioning
coach does this conditioning coach and a,

857
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:03,660
I was pretty close with voice.
Uh,

858
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,050
his wife used to actually be my kid's
babysitter and I knew her when she was

859
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:09,430
going to medical school.
Maryann,

860
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:14,140
she also taught aerobics and was one
of my exes has instructors and very

861
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:18,250
knowledgeable woman when it came to
exercise and fitness and things. And uh,

862
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,280
she was actually going to get her degree
in pediatric medicine and a pediatric

863
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,980
pediatric Hodiak. She
was a foot doctor. Oh,

864
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,160
podiatry. Yeah. Podiatry. And then, uh, I,

865
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,910
I used to bring hoists and he would stay
with me for a prolonged period of time.

866
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,380
He'd stayed with me for, I forget how many
weeks. It was a really long time. And,

867
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:43,040
uh, you know, my wife and
I were older and you know,

868
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,110
we have this young Brazilian kid,
what are you going to do with this guy?

869
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,490
So I said, Marianne, she was really
pretty girl, you know, I said, hey,

870
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,250
what'd you just take him out? I mean, it
just do something, anything, you know.

871
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,210
So she was doing it basically as a favor,
you know, a little bit under protest,

872
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,100
you know. But she, she, she took her out
and show it and if they fell in love, oh,

873
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,860
it was awesome man. I mean
it was so cool, you know?

874
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:09,170
Then he was supposed to go back to
California and we had a huge blizzard

875
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,870
affiliate. All the airport
was shut down, all this stuff.

876
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,560
So he stayed like this extra weight and
that was the first snow that hoist had

877
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:16,550
ever experienced.

878
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:22,220
We made a snowman together and of course
he put ads in the snow man and has a

879
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:26,870
snow man with this, with this big butcher
knife. And is it real much the snowman?

880
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,420
But it's so much fun. Of course he
wanted to drive my car in the store.

881
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,420
I was like, oh my God, fuck out of
here. Did you let him? Yeah. Well, hey,

882
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:39,880
it was horse crazy. He didn't say no
man. How'd that go? He was actually,

883
00:51:39,881 --> 00:51:44,740
it's amazing driver. Very kind
of car. Was it? It was a Subaru.

884
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,530
A front wheel dial. Subarus are great
in the snow. Notoriously greatness now.

885
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,980
So yeah, no, he did great man. He
figured out how to steer into the skid.

886
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,280
I scared the shit out of it.
It's been fun though.

887
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,440
You must have been like a little kid.
That was back in the early days,

888
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:00,680
you know when things were still innocent.
When I started with the Gracies,

889
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,080
they were all one big happy family.
What year was this?

890
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:06,170
This is 89 I had my first
seminar. I said, Holy Shit,

891
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:09,500
this is what I've been looking for, man.
89 so you were way ahead of the curve.

892
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,010
Way Ahead of the curve. I had,
you know, after college wrestling,

893
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:16,700
I coached for a few years in the local
high school. I did the freestyle circuit.

894
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:17,220
But Hey,

895
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,900
it's a young man's sport and it's really
hard when you have a family and you're

896
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:25,901
working to actually go to a university
and train with university wrestlers and

897
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:28,370
you start missing your
timing and you know,

898
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,680
so I was looking for something to
replace the thrill of wrestling.

899
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,560
What were you doing for work then?
I was actually working in a gym.

900
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,870
I was a fitness director for,
uh,

901
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,750
at the Society Hill Club in
Philadelphia at that time.

902
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:47,030
And so I'm just looking for something,
man. I tried to come through. I try,

903
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,110
I try Kemp a crappy day.
I tried to Japanese style karate.

904
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:55,070
I try my hand up and we Thai, I basically
sucked at these striking arts. You know,

905
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,150
it just wasn't in my,
just wasn't in my genetics.

906
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:02,060
I wanted to grab and clinch it used to
really piss my instructors off cause it

907
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,510
was almost like, you know, an
instinctive reaction and uh,

908
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:10,040
I quickly learned that you can avoid like,
you know what,

909
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,380
let's take MMA and put it to a side.

910
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,550
I was interested purely in self
defense at that time. You know,

911
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:20,630
I always felt like somehow I missed the
boat because that was the Bruce Lee era,

912
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:25,680
right? Seventies and, and uh,
later. And I always thought, wow,

913
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,150
I shouldn't have been wasting
my time with wrestling.

914
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:31,620
I shouldn't have been doing like g condo
or, or you know, that it man stuff.

915
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,521
And uh,

916
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:36,960
I didn't realize what a good
basis wrestling really was
and the few scraps I did

917
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:40,530
get in, I found that wow, you know,
double leg take down goes a long way,

918
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:43,410
you smashed somebody, then it's kind
of takes to fight on them a little bit,

919
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:46,470
you know? And uh, but
little striking I do,

920
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,060
I was able to equip myself all right.
And a few scraps I had,

921
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,820
but I still felt like it was something
missing. There's fancy kicks and punches.

922
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,020
And when I saw that Gracie Jujitsu,
I said, man, I could do this,

923
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,190
I could really do this.

924
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:03,270
And then I saw the first Gracie in
action tape and I realized, wow, man,

925
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,700
this is very doable.

926
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:10,050
And so I went into it with this
whole self defense aspect in mind,

927
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,930
which they really emphasize
in those days. But yeah. Hey,

928
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:14,010
it was one big happy family.

929
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:17,400
The [inaudible] has had just split from
horror and when I first met him they

930
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:19,140
went with Chuck Norris as you know,

931
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,950
there was like a bit of a
difference of opinion or whatever.

932
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:27,280
And then after I'd been at the Gracie
Academy for a couple of years, uh, I,

933
00:54:27,281 --> 00:54:29,010
I would fly from Philly.
I had a,

934
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,800
at that point I have my own
gym at night in 19 nine open.

935
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,180
Either go out for a couple of weeks at
a time with a certain budget and I would

936
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:41,181
take like a thousand dollars or whatever
and I would take lessons for $100 at

937
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:46,500
that time with Horian or
voice or Heuler or Hickson.

938
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,750
And I see if I got one move in that hour,
I caught up my hundred dollars move.

939
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,720
Cause usually there would be,
you know how it is in Jujitsu,

940
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:55,770
especially when you're blue belt,

941
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,390
you get really confused and you get in
these positions over and over again and

942
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:02,670
you can't quite figure out what to do.

943
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,780
And if they would give me the answer to
that particular problem, I would say, ah,

944
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:11,700
that was the hundred dollar move that was
worth every penny to me because that's

945
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:15,870
how into it. I was, I would go through my
thousand dollars or so, right with the,

946
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:16,800
with the private lessons.

947
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:20,100
And of course they would throw the
classes in for free since I was buying so

948
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:20,934
many privates.

949
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,120
And then I would go back and I had mats
in my gym and then I would just call up

950
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:29,850
all my old wrestling buddies and
there was a judo club nearby.

951
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:31,170
I would call those guys in.

952
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:34,830
And there was a Kido guys down the
street and I would just basically beat up

953
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,310
these poor guys.
And it didn't know what you were doing.

954
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,020
I had no idea I had rental guys
and knowing that any of it,

955
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,480
they didn't know much. It was more, you
know, Judah became very sports oriented,

956
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:49,270
but I did pick up some good stuff
from the dot. Guys delete. Oh yeah.

957
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:53,820
So good throws and so forth trips at,
but I had what they called wrestler jets,

958
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:58,220
you know, and it pretty rough,
pretty rough stuff. A Lot,
a strength, a lot of power,

959
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,990
just like wrestling, you know what I
mean? What did I know? And um, but I,

960
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,960
I got my blue Bob pretty
quick about six months,

961
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,630
then I got my purple belt
in about a year and a half.

962
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:08,490
I think I went through the ranks,

963
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:13,230
but then I reached the
level of my incompetence and
there I stay prep about for

964
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:16,450
about four years. What do you mean do
reach the level you're in incompetence.

965
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,250
I just couldn't make that
next jump to brown belt.

966
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:23,920
I'm still using too much power. Too much
strange, too much athleticism, you know,

967
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,240
and you know, just as supposed to be
based in technique and relaxation.

968
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,350
And I still didn't have that.

969
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,410
I can remember one time voice
got really pissed off with me.

970
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,240
We were in the middle of a session, you
know, and uh, I was been, what, you know,

971
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,960
she did it is sort of a rude,

972
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,860
I was kind of grabbing the g
in a rough way and you know,

973
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,360
wrestlers had this way of kind of
grinding heads. Sometimes you don't,

974
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,420
it's really pissing him off. And he says,
hey wait, this is the key. This is skin.

975
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,150
And then we wrestled at bay
said, wait, Whoa, whoa, whoa.

976
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,720
Why are you grinding your head into mind?
What,

977
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,790
what are you possibly
thinking to achieve with this?

978
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,430
And then he looked up at
the clock, he says, okay,

979
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,990
these next 10 minutes or going to be
the most terrifying of your life, Steve.

980
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,740
And I'm like, swollen gulp. You
know, I knew I was going to happen.

981
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:16,000
He had basically just wiped
the mat up with me, squeeze me,

982
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:19,330
smashed me knee and the belly and
the ribs and he wouldn't let me tap.

983
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,650
And he just basically thrashed me
for 10 minutes straight, nonstop.

984
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,790
I was just utterly exhausted. Not
Dementia, just the, the, the trauma.

985
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:31,780
I've just been thrown around by
your iPad or your hero, you know,

986
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,900
and who was mad at you. So there
was that emotional thing going on.

987
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:40,150
And then he says, okay, how's it feel?
Steve feels pretty bad. Darn it. I says,

988
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,250
man, it really does. He
says, well, you know,

989
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,090
that's what other people feel like
when you wrestle them. He says,

990
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:50,110
when you rested these other guys, that's
what you're doing to them. He says,

991
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:50,944
not much fun.

992
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:55,750
You're going to turn people off from
Jujitsu so you better never, ever,

993
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,500
I'd never been to catch you again using
all that power and strength and being so

994
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:02,770
rude. And it was like, wow, okay.

995
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,360
And then the next day I got the flu
because it lowered my immune system.

996
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,520
Wow, man, I'm telling you, and you're
asking really kicked my ass. It was,

997
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:12,510
it was rich man

998
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,790
flow and us.
Oh,

999
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:18,590
I was so disappointed
because he's teaching these
seminars and I couldn't go on

1000
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:19,460
the couch with a fever.

1001
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,840
Ah, man. It taught me. Yeah,

1002
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:26,350
such an important message about
relaxation and you know all that.

1003
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,110
Yeah,
I've learned that around it.

1004
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,100
Probably purple belt to just
learn how to relax and how to,

1005
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,610
we'll also learn how to like,
do like a real 20 minutes session.

1006
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:39,290
Like how do you roll with someone for 20
minutes? If you'd just go on, Jack can't,

1007
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,900
you can't sprint for 20 minutes
and there's days. I, you know,

1008
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,070
I still wasn't getting it,

1009
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,310
man. I wasn't getting it. But I,

1010
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,810
that Beaton really made a
profound influence on me and
he did me a great service,

1011
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,770
great service. I always liked that whole
Gracie a teaching aspect of the thing.

1012
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:56,010
You know, like, like Jorge,
I know he said, you know,

1013
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,570
it's not really a martial arts style.
It's a, it's an educational system.

1014
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:02,580
It's a way of teaching Jujitsu.

1015
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,540
Yeah. I liked her a motto, keep it
playful to, you know, Henner and,

1016
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,840
and a here on the, the uh, they say that
all the time, keep it playful, cute,

1017
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:14,110
playful, and it, you know, you, you can
protect yourself while you're doing that.

1018
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:16,800
And then slowly but surely
a guy who was going to ask,

1019
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,810
unless you're dealing with a three minute
match and you're going to have your

1020
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:22,130
opportunities. And you
know, I mean I'm not

1021
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,500
against the competition aspect of it,
but it is different.

1022
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:28,070
I know Allie had told me one time that
he considered the modern day competition

1023
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,880
to be anti Jujitsu. I thought that
was interesting statement. He says,

1024
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:32,714
I would never,

1025
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,140
I would never been able to win like one
of these modern style matches with the

1026
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:38,060
points and all that.
So that wasn't my game.

1027
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,220
He said I couldn't do much to other
people cause I was too small, too weak.

1028
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,230
He said they,
they did it to themselves.

1029
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:49,400
Did Leo do any strength and
conditioning now? Now that I know of,

1030
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,720
I mean he did stretching and you know,
basic jujitsu conditioning stuff,

1031
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:57,380
but he never really believed in weight
training or any of that. But uh, you know,

1032
00:59:57,381 --> 00:59:59,120
he always mentioned how weak he was,

1033
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:02,820
but he did have a strength as grips
were pretty amazing even for an old man.

1034
01:00:02,821 --> 01:00:05,360
And of course he had this huge
Popeye type forums, you know,

1035
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,860
so I mean it was obvious
that he definitely had some
athleticism and strength,

1036
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,900
but he was such a lightweight guy.

1037
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,320
There was no way he's going to
overpower anyone. Right. But have you,

1038
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,840
have you ever read the
biography of Aci made?

1039
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:21,330
The guy that taught the grace and Carlos,
uh,

1040
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,760
I read the Japanese translation into
English and of course it definitely had a

1041
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:29,900
Japanese prejudice to it,
but that guy was a pretty amazing guy.

1042
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:33,620
He was a representative sent from
the code icon. She grew up Kaino,

1043
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:38,621
organized all the Jujitsu clans in Japan
and was trying to come up with the one

1044
01:00:38,631 --> 01:00:42,740
style of Jujitsu, which he
called judo, the gentle way.

1045
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,600
In those days there was a lot of ground
fighting, uh, throws into joint locks,

1046
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:51,170
all this stuff that's illegal. And Modern
Day judo was still part of the game.

1047
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,280
They had knee blocks.
Uh,

1048
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:56,690
I actually watched a video tape
of old black and white footage.

1049
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,380
Some of these old Japanese
masters we're doing the ex guard.

1050
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:05,770
Wow. Leo told me that everything
was there when he, uh,

1051
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,790
when Carlos Learn Jujitsu for my item,
but my Ada,

1052
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,320
a lot of people don't know one over
thousand, no hold barred fights.

1053
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,320
It all styles and a thousand.
That was,

1054
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:17,810
how the hell do you fight a
thousand times. I don't know.

1055
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,980
How's that even possible?
It's like that Hixon 400 old things.

1056
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:24,280
Someone tried to break that down
once of how I would like to know

1057
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:29,860
he did a stage fights and
Spain and England and France.

1058
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,700
Then he came to the u s

1059
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,870
you mean on stage? You don't
mean like staged like no, no.

1060
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:39,540
You determined like they would ask people
from the audience come up and chat,

1061
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,690
like those type of things and there
were no holds barred fights or they were

1062
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:45,320
judo match. They were no hold
bar fights. Wow. They could

1063
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,980
do anything to the guy. And uh,
he fought boxers. Uh, well he,

1064
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:53,630
he he talked was one of the guys
that taught Theodore Roosevelt,

1065
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,890
the early Judah real and
that became a part of the,

1066
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,240
the training for a naval aviator or
army aviators during World War Two.

1067
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:05,330
And a lot of the army
guys in World War II,

1068
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:09,800
that Jujitsu was the basis for
the self defense in the U s army.

1069
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,143
And then,
uh,

1070
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:16,660
one of his cohorts was humiliated by
a champion wrestler from West Point.

1071
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:21,990
And, uh, my ada got some
Japanese businessmen to put
up some money and then he,

1072
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,590
he, he beat the guy that,
that beat his partner.

1073
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,540
And then from there he emigrated to Cuba
and did all of these fights and Cuba.

1074
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:30,781
I mean,

1075
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:35,781
he was fighting like apparently for
money a couple of times a week he went to

1076
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:41,030
Mexico and they would go to the mining
camps where these, these, you know, or,

1077
01:02:41,031 --> 01:02:45,840
or a lumberjack camps where we had all
these guys with a lot of money and they

1078
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:50,841
would bet and sometimes he would almost
lose a match on purpose to encourage

1079
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:53,100
guys to come out there and say,
I can beat this little guy.

1080
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,750
And then he would kick their asses.

1081
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:58,060
Well, it was like Charles Bronson and
hard times. Japanese version. Yeah,

1082
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,110
Japanese version. Wow.
He was only 165 paths,

1083
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,910
but apparently had some
devastating throws.

1084
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:06,800
And his groundwork was just absolutely
superb. He was Wa and Jigger. Oh,

1085
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,200
throw him out. It was out of Buddha.
Like you're doing these fights,

1086
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,510
you're fighting with
no, sometimes, you know,

1087
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:16,410
it's not what we represent here
at the CoCASA. He was baby coat.

1088
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,380
AECON is the main sanctioning body
that was the main sanctioning body,

1089
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:22,740
Japan in Japan at that time. And so, uh,

1090
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:27,300
he kept going further and further down.
And then of course the Gracies met him,

1091
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:29,880
had hap helped him get
a Japanese immigration.

1092
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:33,420
Connie started the father of Carlos.

1093
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:37,980
Gracie helped this, my Ada
guy get established. And uh,

1094
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,630
in, in gratitude, he, he, uh,
he taught the, the five sons.

1095
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:50,580
Uh, it was Carlos, Oswaldo, uh,
I forget the guys, but there was,

1096
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:52,020
you know,
Carlos had the five brothers.

1097
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,600
The only guy that didn't
directly get taught was Elio.

1098
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,010
Elio learned his Jujitsu pretty
much from Carlos. He was very weak,

1099
01:03:59,011 --> 01:04:01,110
sickly child at the time. And, uh, uh,

1100
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,190
they basically were doing
the Jujitsu of my Ada. Wow.

1101
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,280
And then ll would watch his brother
teach and then it was discovered that,

1102
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,550
wow, he's really adept. There's, you know,

1103
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:17,790
he has a real knack for
teaching and doing Jujitsu.

1104
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,210
Carlos kind of just handed the reins over
to La and then he took it and ran with

1105
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:23,760
it and developed it and the
rest is pretty much history.

1106
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,200
It's so fascinating that even to this
day the smaller guys are the more

1107
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:32,160
technical guys and when you think about
the birth of Jujitsu happening from

1108
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:34,860
Carlos Teaching Leo and
Leo being a small guy,

1109
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,740
his Jujitsu became very
technical like the last year of,

1110
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,650
see we were talking about
this when it comes up,

1111
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:42,930
when the fly weights in the Bantam,
he,

1112
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:46,500
so 120 535 pound fighters and I,
I've said many,

1113
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:49,650
many times if you want to see excellent
technique like these are really the guys

1114
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:52,890
to watch first of all because
they never get tired and too,

1115
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:55,740
because when you're 125
pound guy and you're the gym,

1116
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,000
you're not muscling
anybody around that muscle.

1117
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,390
You got to learn to do
everything correctly.

1118
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:03,430
Everything has to be proper technique.
Everything has to be perfect form.

1119
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:07,110
You have a gravity and strength
disadvantage from the jump.

1120
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:11,460
And so because of that you learn to do
everything absolutely correctly mean you

1121
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:16,461
very rarely see like a really good light
Jujitsu guy who tries to muscle things.

1122
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:18,190
They

1123
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,580
don't try to muscle sometimes it actually
bachelors and they'll do that right up

1124
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:25,720
through about purple Bob like
myself and then they get lost.

1125
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,760
They're tech, they're the, the,

1126
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:31,660
the technique begins to outstrip their
strengths at the brown and black belt

1127
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:36,070
levels. The guys, everyone
is strong in good shape,

1128
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:39,010
but they have incredible
technique at that level.

1129
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,560
So if you've been basing most of your,

1130
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:45,190
your winnings on athleticism
and strength and all that,

1131
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,340
once you hit brown belt, man, I forget it.

1132
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,250
It's not going to happen too much
anymore. Yeah. I've always said, man,

1133
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:54,850
if you could get a guy like Mark Coleman
who was such a dominant wrestler in his

1134
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,650
prime, you know, when he was
at UFC heavyweight champion,

1135
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,270
if that guy just fell in love with
Hugh Jitsu and just was passed the card

1136
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:03,640
mounting taking packs,
take an arm bars,

1137
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,460
I mean he would've just been a fucking
beast. Bit of based. Well yeah.

1138
01:06:07,461 --> 01:06:11,020
Oh he was a beast. Kenny, Kevin
Randleman, all those guys.

1139
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:14,740
None of them embrace Jujitsu. Nah, they
never did. It was always, you know,

1140
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,380
well it's that restaurant mentality.
I mean, I had it, you know,

1141
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:18,370
I thought I'd do everything.

1142
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:21,680
Your wrestlers are pretty aggressive
guys and you know, you're,

1143
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:25,990
you're very confident in yourself and
there's a tendency to think you know,

1144
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,690
everything but smart wrestlers,
you know,

1145
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:33,700
they eventually they start to lighten up
and they start to embrace the technique

1146
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:36,040
of Jujitsu.
It makes it perfect combination.

1147
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:39,660
It's real easy for wrestlers to just
slide right in there, man. Sure.

1148
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,121
It's just about,

1149
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,920
I mean that's her thing about wrestling
as opposed to Jujitsu as wrestlers are

1150
01:06:42,921 --> 01:06:47,921
so much more drill oriented wrestlers
like by necessity drill techniques a lot

1151
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:52,990
con constant training. If you go
to any high level wrestling room,

1152
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:55,960
you'll watch guys hit techniques over and
over and over and over and over again.

1153
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:59,860
Whereas in Jujitsu this is like a
little bit of drilling and then okay,

1154
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:04,270
if free train everybody this role and
everybody just role because it's so fun,

1155
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:08,390
so just roll. So front of
just try to submit each other
that you know they don't,

1156
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,940
they don't do the same sort of drilling
and technique based training that a lot

1157
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:16,660
of wrestlers to at the highest
level wrestling on the feet.

1158
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:20,930
The standup part of wrestling is just
as technical shit too in many ways.

1159
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:23,530
Subtle lot of setups.

1160
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,540
I mean it's pretty amazing.
Those guys that flow wrestling,

1161
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,140
you ever gone to that? Right? I
love that website. Great website,

1162
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:35,980
but they do a great job of explaining
that and showing how technical the

1163
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:39,490
European and the Russian
wrestlers are and you know, how,

1164
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:44,790
how much more they rely on
those techniques and the
subtle varieties of their,

1165
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:49,870
their exchanges and their entrances
into techniques. I really liked that.

1166
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:53,410
I liked the emphasizing that aspect of
the wrestling cause a lot of people don't

1167
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:56,710
know what it is. You see big, strong
guys trying to overpower each other.

1168
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:57,431
You don't understand this.

1169
01:07:57,431 --> 01:08:02,200
It's like there's so many different
moves that are being exchanged at a rapid

1170
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:06,940
pace. And you know, so many
tax centers. Yeah. Faints.

1171
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:11,050
And I had the privilege of working
with five times of Ukrainian national

1172
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:12,520
wrestling champion,
Andre Brenner.

1173
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,070
He used to come up to my school in
Philadelphia all the time and wow. The

1174
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,590
guys showed me so much
technical wrestling. And then
one of my students was uh,

1175
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:25,520
uh, your Sushi Miyaki who was one of the
judges for pride. He was a fourth don,

1176
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:27,700
a black belt in judo from the critical on.

1177
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,790
But he was also three time world
Greco Roman wrestling champion. Wow.

1178
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:36,350
And he was working for a Japanese import
company in Philly, came into our school.

1179
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,760
God was, you know, the big
thick coke bottle glasses.

1180
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,900
Just this kind of silly little grand,
really polite. He's bowing a lot.

1181
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:49,730
He spoke almost no English and you know,
so he went in to train with us.

1182
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,480
So we get McGee, you know,
he puts, he puts on the wipe
out, you know? No, no foss.

1183
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,000
Next thing I know he's launching dudes,
man.

1184
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,550
Oh my God.

1185
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:03,590
What a sleeper wipe out man.
I mean,

1186
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,630
and you had no idea what
his background was doing.

1187
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:10,430
Like sagging Auggie's from the knees
and throwing guys, man. It's like wow.

1188
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,870
So we finally get the guy to write his
name for us so we could Google them.

1189
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,640
And then what year was this?

1190
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,900
This is like 95 [inaudible] 95 no,

1191
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,680
there was like some sort of an internet
or some kind of internet cause I,

1192
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:27,920
I was completely non tech. I didn't
even have a laptop in those days. Joe.

1193
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:31,340
I didn't even have a cell phone
back at 95 so I don't know.

1194
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:34,030
What am I students did whatever
that you do on the, on,

1195
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:39,050
on a computer and looked him up and
found him. And then we said, Holy Shit,

1196
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,890
you've got a gym.
This guy is unbelievable man.

1197
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:47,970
And we were shocked. It was like three
times. Well, Greco Roman, he was a,

1198
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,470
uh,
an Olympian and the Atlanta Olympics.

1199
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,290
Wow. He plays this just try to
out of the metal round. Yeah.

1200
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,090
He just wanted us to
train and he was saying,

1201
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:57,800
I guess he had heard
about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,

1202
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:02,200
want to try it out. And uh, he
went through the rags fit fast man.

1203
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:07,370
I actually took him the first professional
grappling tournament was the pro am

1204
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:09,220
event out of South Carolina.
Do you remember this?

1205
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,630
There was a couple of guys that put it
on a couple of hundred entrepreneurs.

1206
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,020
A man,
I'm terrible for these dates.

1207
01:10:14,021 --> 01:10:15,970
Managed really put me on
the spot with these dates.

1208
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,300
Uh, but buzz pre a hoists
and Willie g, right.

1209
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:25,080
That was 98 was hoists and well,
easy when you went down to Brazil,

1210
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:29,160
I think it was, yeah, it was pray,
pray. And I was probably, oh, I got it.

1211
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,363
Oh,

1212
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:37,080
maybe it was 2000 after 2000
you say she in this thing,

1213
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:41,000
it took second place. It gets really
good black belts at that time.

1214
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:44,470
I wish I could remember something that
I know heuler fought. Uh, there was,

1215
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:48,920
it was like a WHO's who of wow.
Grappling Solow fought. He uh,

1216
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:53,320
he fought this catch wrestler guy.
No kidding. It was real interesting.

1217
01:10:53,321 --> 01:10:54,610
It was like a mixed grappling style,

1218
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:58,840
but it's called the pro am it was
like the first professional level type

1219
01:10:58,841 --> 01:10:59,470
grappling.
Yeah,

1220
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:03,790
I remember it vaguely now. I remember
it vaguely now, but I was still,

1221
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,510
I was really, I started in 96. I started,

1222
01:11:07,511 --> 01:11:11,200
I took my first class at
Hickson's and then um,

1223
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,070
Hickson's was pretty far down.
It was on Pico

1224
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,070
and I found that Carlson
had a place on Hawthorne,

1225
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:20,940
which is like really close to where I
was working. So, uh, I went to cross,

1226
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,520
to me it was a white belt
was like Gracie is Gracie.

1227
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,540
Yeah, for sure. I mean, and I

1228
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,410
came in right when
[inaudible] was fighting.

1229
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:32,370
John Hess with Vito was like 18 years
old and they were calling him victor

1230
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:37,020
Gracie. It wasn't Vietor they
put a k in there. I don't,
you know, I don't know why.

1231
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,810
What happened? They changed his
name. I don't know what happened,

1232
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:44,150
but it was Victor Gracie,
Victor Carlson was trying to uh,

1233
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:46,530
adopt him or was treating
him like he was his son.

1234
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:50,100
And so he's taking on the name Gracie.
Cause the Gracie name was huge back then,

1235
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,340
96, a couple of years after the
ultimate fighting championship.

1236
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:54,174
Everybody wanted to train with him.

1237
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,380
Everybody wanted to be a grace.
Yeah.

1238
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:59,100
Yeah. And um, uh,

1239
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,190
I got a chance to see a
Mario Sperry was down there.

1240
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,380
Marillo booster mom
was training back then.

1241
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:09,060
Sergio Colin like all these black belts
from Brazil. Carlos by Hato was there.

1242
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,780
They were the guys man

1243
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,930
laid the foundations here in America.
You know,

1244
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,460
I just got so lucky I came in and I got
to watch that all happen right during

1245
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:18,590
the extreme fighting days.

1246
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:21,750
Remember that when John Perretti was
putting on those extreme fighting

1247
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:25,230
challenges and half Gracie was
there and you know, half grace,

1248
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:29,650
he was fighting those. Remember
those, those, that was the
back of the day. That was

1249
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,110
back in the day, man. Well,

1250
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,010
a lot of people don't realize
you're your athletic prowess either.

1251
01:12:36,011 --> 01:12:39,820
I mean a lot of your listeners have no
clue. I'm always shocked when I say, well,

1252
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:44,200
Joe is like world class athlete man.
People always say really?

1253
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:48,850
It says, yeah, he's not just a television
host or comedian or an actor. He says,

1254
01:12:48,851 --> 01:12:50,020
this guy can rumble,
man,

1255
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:53,590
I'll never forget when you show me that
spinning back kick and the banana bags

1256
01:12:53,591 --> 01:12:56,560
into your garage. I mean there
were 200 pound bags, Joe,

1257
01:12:56,561 --> 01:13:01,561
you were bending those things in half
my ribs hurt just watching you do that

1258
01:13:01,751 --> 01:13:02,380
man.

1259
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:07,110
So a lot of people don't realize your
pedigree and Jujitsu and submission,

1260
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,940
wrestling and kickboxing to a man.
So

1261
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,530
well, I've been obsessed with
it my whole life. You know,

1262
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:15,720
the only thing that's been fucking with
me lately is I haven't really been able

1263
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:17,490
to roll hard for the last year.

1264
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:22,410
I've only rolled a little once over the
last year I had a bulging disc in my

1265
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:27,060
back, actually my neck and a, I started
doing this thing called Regena keen.

1266
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,550
I did a bunch of different
therapies for it, uh,

1267
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:34,551
but I was really worried about pursuing
Jujitsu pass this because I started

1268
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:38,720
getting numbness in my fingers and uh,

1269
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,540
I had heard a lot of horror stories
and I'm friends with boss route and of

1270
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:46,110
course and bus route and has had a
pretty bad neck injury that he's had two

1271
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:47,040
surgeries on.

1272
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,770
And he actually just started going and
doing Regena keen at the same place where

1273
01:13:49,771 --> 01:13:51,120
I've had it done.

1274
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:56,570
And so I went through a bunch of
different procedures and after a year of

1275
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:01,650
different therapies, like, um,
uh, I did, uh, prolo ozone,

1276
01:14:01,651 --> 01:14:06,110
which is prolotherapy with ozone,
which stimulates healing. And, uh,

1277
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:11,120
I did a lot of thing like really hardcore
deep tissue massage and a soft tissue

1278
01:14:11,261 --> 01:14:13,780
manipulation there with Ralf.
Do you, do you do any of that?

1279
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:18,280
I was actually Ralf by Ida Rolf
Son. Whoa. They guy, you know,

1280
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,870
she invented rolfing out of frustration
because her son went through that polio

1281
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:25,900
epidemic of the 50s.
It was all twisted up,

1282
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:30,130
this poor kid and she took
him to specialist after
specialist and just that she

1283
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:34,270
had a phd in biochemistry is very
intelligent one and a sheer frustration.

1284
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:39,271
She just started molding the boy herself
and came up with their ideas of rolfing

1285
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:42,610
and then began to teach other people
the postural integration techniques.

1286
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,230
I was wrought by that point.

1287
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,690
Wow,
that's amazing.

1288
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:50,370
He was an amazing role for, and then I
had a woman in Philadelphia, Linda grace,

1289
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,330
fantastic. One of the professors at
the Rolf Institute, they, they, they,

1290
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,910
they go and teach for a
while and they, they uh, they
revolve in and out. You know,

1291
01:14:59,911 --> 01:15:02,100
it's not always the same
professors at the Rolf Institute,

1292
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,650
but this woman saved my own
life and my Jujitsu career,

1293
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,600
I had some pretty horrific injuries.

1294
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,760
No one ever said that playing combat
sports is healthy man. No Man.

1295
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:14,320
I had this conversation today with
the doctor because uh, I've been a,

1296
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:16,570
I have some photos of it then
I'm going to put up on Instagram,

1297
01:15:16,571 --> 01:15:20,560
but I'll show them to you with, with this
process is, but it's pretty fascinating.

1298
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:24,750
What they do is they take
your blood and they, um,

1299
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:29,790
this is me lying on this table with all
these needles in my back and then those

1300
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:34,710
little tubes on the end of the needles,
that's where they pumped this serum in.

1301
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,880
I put all these on Instagram
later so you guys can see them.

1302
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,540
And what it is is you,

1303
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:44,550
they take your blood and the blood is
placed in a centrifuge and it spun around

1304
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:50,050
and it's heated.
And somehow we're another,

1305
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:54,870
during this process, like it treats your
body, treats the blood, like the blood,

1306
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,090
the blood reacts as if it's having,
like if there's a fever.

1307
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:03,360
And so it generates this intense anti
inflammatory response and this yellow

1308
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:08,290
fluid becomes the most potent
antiinflammatory medication known to man.

1309
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,350
And it's produced by your own blood,
which is really amazing.

1310
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:16,270
So they pull this yellow serum out and
then they inject it directly into the

1311
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:20,570
injured areas with dramatic results
around antiflammatory. Yes. You know,

1312
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:22,270
we had talked about supplements earlier,
right?

1313
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:25,500
And I, uh, I used to be quite
the supplement hound, you know,

1314
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,210
anywhere between two 50 to $300 a
month as spending it supplements.

1315
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:35,780
And I quickly realized that I was actually
undermining my body's ability to make

1316
01:16:36,331 --> 01:16:38,550
its own anti inflammatories.

1317
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:41,820
Your body went as being fed
properly and you die. You know,

1318
01:16:41,821 --> 01:16:45,540
your digestion isn't in order and you're
assimilating the nutrients that you

1319
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:46,560
need from your diet.

1320
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:52,160
You make your own anti-inflammatories
and you do not need to be taking a lot of

1321
01:16:52,921 --> 01:16:56,670
extra nutrients. If anything, it
throws you completely out of balance.

1322
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:57,601
Well,

1323
01:16:57,601 --> 01:17:02,601
I'm sure that your body can make anti
inflammatory responses to injuries,

1324
01:17:03,631 --> 01:17:06,720
but nothing like this. I mean,
your body is making it this,

1325
01:17:06,721 --> 01:17:10,410
but what you're using your own body's,
yeah.

1326
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:13,370
So it's different than taking
this up. Well, it's also,

1327
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,070
they're directly injecting it into the,

1328
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:20,570
this guy doctor Peter welling is a
spinal surgeon in Dusseldorf, Germany.

1329
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,390
And he's the one who
figured this out. Um, it's,

1330
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,220
he is his twos two year
study of osteoarthritis of
the knee that's published in

1331
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:31,760
the medical journal Journal,
osteoarthritis and cartilage,

1332
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:36,970
which a started a lot of all this off
and got a lot of people invested in this,

1333
01:17:37,341 --> 01:17:37,730
uh,

1334
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:42,730
this procedure and they figured it out
in Germany and like 2003 and the United

1335
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,310
States has really been hampered is a
lot of this research because of all the

1336
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:50,780
shit that went down with
stem cell research. The
religious right was, you know,

1337
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:53,870
really putting the brakes on
any sort of stem cell research.

1338
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:58,820
And they were connecting
stem cell research with fetal
tissue and aborted babies

1339
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:01,970
and people are going to abort
babies just to get the fetal tissue.

1340
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:06,200
There was so much fucking craziness.
And this,

1341
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:10,640
this thing that they do,
the, the way that it defer,

1342
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:14,390
it differentiates between play
platelet rich plasma, which is a,

1343
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,070
what a lot of people think of when they
think of like blood spinning with this

1344
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:23,570
is it's, it's a little bit
more potent. And I'm going
to, I'll, I would butcher it.

1345
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:26,570
So if anybody's interested in
it, read about it online. Uh,

1346
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,920
they call it Ortho keen in Germany and
it's called Regina keen in America,

1347
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:32,720
but they do it in Santa Monica now.

1348
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:35,960
It's done in Vegas and Dallas and
they're doing it all over the place with

1349
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:39,020
miraculous results for athletes.
There's a lot of athletes that have,

1350
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,900
well all these guys are,
we're flying to Germany.

1351
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:46,090
Like Kobe Bryant was flying to
Germany. Um, uh, what is his name? Um,

1352
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:49,430
Peyton manning at two neck surgeries
is ready to retire from football.

1353
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:52,910
Went and got orthokine in Germany
and boom, playing better football.

1354
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:56,190
That I was pretty amazing. Those NFL guys.
Hey, can we take a brief break? Sure.

1355
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,940
I just need to hit the, uh, hit
the head. Go ahead. Go ahead man.

1356
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:03,680
That awesome coffee gave me just listen
man, it takes a while to get us to,

1357
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:06,440
I got that old man bladder going on.
Don't worry about it, dude. I'll, uh,

1358
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:09,320
I got a lot of shit to shit to
talk about and let people know. Um,

1359
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,660
anybody who's interested
in that, uh, the place,

1360
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:14,310
if you're anywhere near Santa Monica.
Um,

1361
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:19,330
the guy that I go to a for this Regina
king thing and have no financial just to

1362
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:21,560
in the interest of full disclosure is no,

1363
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:25,160
I have no financial interest in
this whatsoever. Um, his, uh,

1364
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:28,730
his name is doctor Ben
[inaudible]. Uh, and uh,

1365
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:33,760
he does it out of a place called lifespan
medicine that is in Santa Monica and

1366
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:35,030
it's incredible stuff.

1367
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:39,350
And it's also the beautiful thing about
it is you don't have to worry about your

1368
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:42,710
body rejecting it. This is all something
that your body naturally produces.

1369
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,780
So if you're interested,
um,

1370
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:49,190
just run a Google search on it and find
out if there's a place anywhere near you

1371
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:53,960
that, uh, that has this. But for me,
I've had amazing results with this.

1372
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:58,610
Um, and then, uh, for, from that and
the rolfing and all these other, uh,

1373
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:02,570
different procedures that
I've tried out of all of them,

1374
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:07,571
the Regena keen has had the most dramatic
responses because it's pretty dramatic

1375
01:20:08,371 --> 01:20:12,140
and pretty quickly. Um,
I've also found that, uh,

1376
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,090
if you have any joint pain
people out there with joint pain,

1377
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:20,280
a big one for me has been fish oil.
Fish oil is really incredible,

1378
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,940
anti inflammatory properties to it.
Uh,

1379
01:20:22,941 --> 01:20:25,230
and I have a friend
who's a carpenter and he,

1380
01:20:25,231 --> 01:20:28,110
he's told me that through taking fish oil,

1381
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:31,950
like used to get like really sore knees
and elbows after long day at work,

1382
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:35,580
just completely eradicated a
lot of that stuff. Um, I take,

1383
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:38,100
I take pretty high dose fish oils.

1384
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:43,200
I mean there's pros and cons and people
will argue that, uh, I take 10 a day,

1385
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:45,810
I take 10 pills a day,
10,000 milligrams.

1386
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,490
And some people say that's overdoing it
and probably Steve would say it's over

1387
01:20:48,491 --> 01:20:51,390
doing it. I Dunno. But I
work out like a madman.

1388
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,810
And for me it has a huge
difference between when I take it.

1389
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:59,940
And when I don't take it, I
just feel like, uh, I have
less, less joint soreness,

1390
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:04,760
which is a really important for me. He,
I, you know, I'll, I would try what,

1391
01:21:04,761 --> 01:21:09,450
what you're doing, but I eat like
a fucking a mad man. And I just,

1392
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,920
I don't see myself eating only a,
a vegetable meal and then a meat meal.

1393
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:17,160
I eat like a fucking pig
dude. I Dunno. I always have,

1394
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:22,040
I eat less, um, bad things.
Like, uh, I've, I've,

1395
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,140
I eat very little sugar at
this point in my life. Um,

1396
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:30,060
I will reward myself every now and then
with like some ice cream or a treat.

1397
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:33,770
But for the most part, I get
all my sweets from fruits. I,

1398
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,660
I very rarely indulge in any show.

1399
01:21:36,661 --> 01:21:38,400
Like somebody offers me
candy or something like that,

1400
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:41,790
unless there's pot in it
all, you know, pop candy.

1401
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,140
Yeah. I'm not a, I'm not really into
sugar myself, other than eating fruit.

1402
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:50,670
You know, some people say, well, how
about the fructose? But they forget that,

1403
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:54,960
you know, it's all bound with fiber push
up to this thing. And uh, there we go.

1404
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:59,310
And it slows down the digestion so that
you're not getting this big sugar rush

1405
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:02,130
or anything when you're
eating raw natural fruit.

1406
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:06,440
Well, that's part of what's going on with
this bulletproof coffee idea. The idea,

1407
01:22:06,441 --> 01:22:09,260
which was a, apparently it was
originally invented by Robb Wolf on,

1408
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:11,630
or if you know rob banks with a Paleo guy.
Yeah,

1409
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:15,560
he was the guy who created
an Dave Asprey's guy. I've
sort of made it popular,

1410
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,440
but a lot of it because being on the show,

1411
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:22,480
but the grass fed butter and MCT oil
is what slows down the digestion of the

1412
01:22:24,501 --> 01:22:29,240
caffeine because it's blended up
together with the coffee that it just,

1413
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,960
because when I drank, I like black coffee,
I like to drink black coffee. But man,

1414
01:22:32,961 --> 01:22:36,290
the difference in like the bang,
well bang,

1415
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,580
there's a big difference in the spike
and crash with that as opposed to this

1416
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,200
stuff,
which is like a slow burn.

1417
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:45,530
And that's also the same
thing with eating fructose,

1418
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,260
which you get from an
apple or from an orange.

1419
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:51,050
It's like you're getting it in
a natural way and it's also,

1420
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,270
it's sort of a natural reward system.

1421
01:22:53,271 --> 01:22:55,660
Your body is getting this
sweetness because you're,

1422
01:22:55,661 --> 01:22:59,060
you're ingesting all these nutrients.
Like your body's letting you know, Ooh,

1423
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,670
you feel that mouth pleasure,
good, keep eating something stupid.

1424
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:04,730
We need all that stuff. You need the
vitamin C, we need the fiber, we need the,

1425
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,190
you know,
it's all good

1426
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,210
energy,
good,

1427
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,930
good for your body as opposed to this
weird thing that we've invented where we

1428
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:15,931
figured out how to process sugar and pull
it out of all these fruits and pull it

1429
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:20,530
out a corn and to just shoot it right
into your fucking bloodstream. I mean,

1430
01:23:20,531 --> 01:23:24,700
when you're eating that high fructose
corn syrup means your body doesn't know

1431
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:28,480
what the fuck you're doing. Like what
is this? How are you getting this ever?

1432
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:31,850
Never before in the history of man,
whether these type of Franken foods,

1433
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,830
but I mean even sugar cane
where white folks, I mean,

1434
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,100
have you ever actually eaten sugar yet?
I have when I lived in Florida.

1435
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:40,750
All different experiences.
Delicious. Yeah,

1436
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:45,680
but I mean you don't get that rush
because it's what's a fruit? It's,

1437
01:23:45,681 --> 01:23:50,681
it's bound up with all the other nutrients
and fibers and so forth that you get

1438
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:54,580
in a whole food as as opposed
to a fractionated food. Yeah.

1439
01:23:54,581 --> 01:23:57,610
When I lived in Florida, me and my
friends used to cut sugar cane down.

1440
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:01,330
Whether there was like a sugar cane field
near our house that was a university

1441
01:24:01,331 --> 01:24:04,290
of Florida in Gainesville.
They had these,

1442
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:06,820
I don't know why they had
sugarcane just growing there,

1443
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:10,570
but it wasn't like we were stealing it
from anybody. It was just growing there.

1444
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:12,910
So we'd go and we'd cut it down.
We just eat it.

1445
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:16,180
And I guess it's not a fruit
technically cause a fruit, you know,

1446
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,970
it's something that grows on a plant
and you pluck it off the plant.

1447
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,380
I get tomatoes, grass, I believe
maybe. Is that what it is? Yeah,

1448
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:25,360
I think it's a grass. Like tomato
is technically a fruit, right?

1449
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:26,440
Isn't that how it goes?

1450
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:29,930
Like it's considered a
vegetable agriculturally is
considered an export belief.

1451
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:33,280
It is a fruit. Like how it's taxed.
I think they consider it a vegetable,

1452
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:37,980
but it's a, it's a fruit.
But uh, you know, the, the,

1453
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:41,980
the Diet, I mean man seems to be
able to adapt to any number of dies.

1454
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:42,500
I don't know whether the,

1455
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,640
if I heard this guy western price
that went around the world, uh,

1456
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:48,940
he was looking at indigenous people.
This was the time earlier,

1457
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:53,590
the 19 hundreds when there was indigenous
people still around and he was looking

1458
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:56,920
for signs of health. He
was a dentist. So you know,

1459
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:01,480
tooth health is a very good indicator
of a person's overall health.

1460
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:05,590
If you have rotten teeth, your
general health is pretty poor. I mean,

1461
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:10,150
they've even like gum disease to heart
problems and all that kind of stuff.

1462
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:14,170
So he went all of the world.
He was looking at every
type of population possible.

1463
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:19,270
Uh, the annual ad, you know,
the Polynesians, uh, you
know, these different places.

1464
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:23,500
And he came to the conclusion that man is,
is a very adaptable creature.

1465
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:28,740
There's any number of diets that a human
being can thrive on quite healthfully.

1466
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:34,240
But the thing that seemed to be
commonplace to all of these people was the

1467
01:25:34,241 --> 01:25:37,630
purity of the food,
the naturalists of the food,

1468
01:25:37,631 --> 01:25:42,040
the freshness of the food and the
lack of stress in their diets.

1469
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:44,860
And of course the exposure to
sunlight and vitamin D and so forth.

1470
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,890
And I mean in his estimation,

1471
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:51,970
the most magnificent of all
the populations he studied
where the Polynesians who

1472
01:25:51,971 --> 01:25:54,970
were living primarily
on a starch based diet,

1473
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,310
Taro and fish and coconut.

1474
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:01,120
You were the first person to also
set me hip to the idea of um,

1475
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,280
Sun tanning for conditioning

1476
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,690
that suntanning the vitamin D levels
get raised in your body and that,

1477
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,100
you know, like when George Saint Pierre
would fight with a Tan, that there's,

1478
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:16,220
that it's not for vanity
like, no, no, not at all.

1479
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:17,830
It's uh,
the,

1480
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,240
the tanning salons have gotten a bad
rap because people go in there and bake

1481
01:26:21,241 --> 01:26:23,880
themselves just like people bake
themselves into the regular sun.

1482
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:27,030
But if you go in with the idea
of not going for the Tan per se,

1483
01:26:27,031 --> 01:26:28,920
but to convert vitamin D in the skin,

1484
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:32,010
even if you're in a place
like Iceland for example,

1485
01:26:32,011 --> 01:26:33,690
where you don't even get
son half of the year,

1486
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:38,250
your body makes its own natural vitamin
D and You just go in for a few minutes,

1487
01:26:38,251 --> 01:26:43,050
maybe four times a month, and you, your
body will make all the vitamin D you need.

1488
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,190
It's a very anabolic, a nutrient. Uh,

1489
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:51,390
it's absolutely essential for immunity
and a muscular growth and recovery.

1490
01:26:52,201 --> 01:26:53,460
And it's really important.

1491
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:58,320
I had no idea that athletes actually
would tan just to raise their natural

1492
01:26:58,321 --> 01:27:00,870
levels of vitamin D and to aid
in their conditioning though

1493
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:02,540
a lot of people don't even know about it.

1494
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:07,370
But a vitamin D actually even has kind
of a steroid like effect on your body,

1495
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,800
you know?
But he's very animal

1496
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,360
d three, right? Three is
the big one. Yeah. Yeah.

1497
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:16,361
We had doctor Rhonda Patrick on who is
just a brilliant found my fitness has her

1498
01:27:16,551 --> 01:27:20,390
name on, on Twitter. And we're having
around again soon, fascinating,

1499
01:27:20,391 --> 01:27:24,920
fascinating woman who is just really
brilliant and knows a tremendous amount

1500
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:25,970
about the human body.

1501
01:27:25,971 --> 01:27:30,380
And it's just a great resource for us
to be able to ask her questions about,

1502
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,950
you know, what does this and why does
that work and what is this about?

1503
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,970
How did Carlos Gracie, like he was
the one who invented the Gracie Diet,

1504
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,760
these common detory foods.
And how did he figure that out?

1505
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:42,360
Uh, well, you know,

1506
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:45,880
there was another Brazilian writer is
that talked a lot about food combining.

1507
01:27:45,881 --> 01:27:49,660
I actually read a translation of his
book and, uh, there was a lot of food,

1508
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:50,830
good binding people at the time.

1509
01:27:50,831 --> 01:27:54,280
It was fairly well known back
in the early 19 hundreds.

1510
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:59,560
This doctor John Toda and I
told you about, he wrote a
book toxemia explained. Uh,

1511
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:03,610
but there was also a doctor Herbert
m Sheldon who wrote, uh, uh,

1512
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:08,260
food combining made easy. It was fairly
common knowledge until a lot of the,

1513
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,320
uh, nature paths and, and, and, uh,

1514
01:28:11,321 --> 01:28:13,570
alternative medical
people back in the day.

1515
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:18,870
This is at a crossroads where the medical
establishment was beginning to take

1516
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:23,140
over and they were in cahoots with
the big pharmaceutical industry.

1517
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:26,990
And they, this is at
the time when the, the,

1518
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:30,880
the drug companies were really beginning
to develop a lot of vaccines and drugs.

1519
01:28:30,881 --> 01:28:34,600
And that's when the western medical model
was all going towards the drug side.

1520
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:38,200
And they, they, the, uh, the,

1521
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,560
the chiropractors are getting pushed
out and alternative people were being

1522
01:28:41,561 --> 01:28:46,180
pushed out, osteopathy, uh, you
know, nature paths and so forth.

1523
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,210
But, uh, you know, I've,

1524
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:52,930
I've done a lot of reading
and research on my own and uh,

1525
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:58,260
I I've pretty much pulled away
from western medical model and uh,

1526
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,060
I tried to do things as natural as I can,

1527
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,270
haven't been to a doctor
Joe and probably about 40.

1528
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,800
So you don't ever get your blood work,
Tom,

1529
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:09,520
you just go based on how you
feel and if you don't feel good,

1530
01:29:09,521 --> 01:29:10,450
what do you do about it?

1531
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:15,010
Like I fast. Really? Yeah.
Your body, you don't feel good.

1532
01:29:15,011 --> 01:29:15,940
You fast.
Yeah.

1533
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,460
Funeral like shit. I'm like, Oh man, I
feel like shit. I'm just not going to eat

1534
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,200
anything. Well I see it in
a fasting state. Your body,

1535
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,980
it goes to the morbid disease
tissues in the body in its wisdom.

1536
01:29:25,981 --> 01:29:29,730
It doesn't go to muscle. Yeah. Whoa.

1537
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:34,110
Your body is very wise.
So when you're not feeling well,

1538
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:39,140
it's usually digestive system related
in some way and putting more food in

1539
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:45,030
burdening your body. People don't realize
just what a burden digestion really is.

1540
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:46,950
It takes a lot out of you to digest food.

1541
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:51,850
Is that why people that have a lower
caloric diets are people that eat less

1542
01:29:51,851 --> 01:29:53,110
generally live longer?

1543
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:56,280
Well, for sure, I mean, and
and many animal studies,

1544
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:59,460
they found that by systematically under
feeding animals pro prolonging their

1545
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:01,470
lives a really,
really long time.

1546
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,340
You know, Rhonda Patrick,
who had just mentioned,

1547
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,380
one of the things that she brought up
was a study where they showed that it's,

1548
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:12,320
it's actually a genetic transference
that people who have survived through

1549
01:30:12,321 --> 01:30:15,620
famine,
their children actually live longer.

1550
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:20,770
Like the children of people who
have had like less calories,

1551
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:25,370
they're their children actually have
longer life spans. It's fascinating.

1552
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:30,000
Well, if you look at animal
husbandry, you can your prize bull,

1553
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,510
your price stallion.
You know, your stud dog,

1554
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:38,310
they have relatively short life spans,
big muscular bull. You know, they,

1555
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:41,040
they feed these animals that
they built a lot of mass.

1556
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,650
They did not live very long at all.

1557
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:48,030
It's because your system gets over taxed
to maintain all that muscle will become

1558
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,980
innovated. The, the, the, the, you know,

1559
01:30:49,981 --> 01:30:54,240
you only have a finite amount
of energy and it, it gets taxed.

1560
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:56,190
You know,
that's a big debate.

1561
01:30:56,191 --> 01:30:59,010
The amount of muscle you should
have as a martial artist.

1562
01:30:59,011 --> 01:31:02,260
That's a huge issue that comes up a lot.
Um,

1563
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:05,400
it comes up a lot in my own commentary
because I find it fascinating.

1564
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:09,300
There's certain guys like the guys
like the Hector Lombard's or the Tyron

1565
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,070
Woodley's,
he's really muscular,

1566
01:31:11,071 --> 01:31:16,071
like abnormally muscular guys who were
fucking hell on wheels for a few minutes,

1567
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,680
but they can't maintain like
a guy like say you know,

1568
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:22,140
like a Diego Sanchez,

1569
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:26,580
the guy who was known for having fantastic
director but Diego's worn a lot of

1570
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:27,930
guys out in that third round.

1571
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:31,410
The third round is where Diego is the
scariest motherfucker on earth cause he's

1572
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:32,940
just as fresh as he wasn't the first.

1573
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:35,700
Like look at Jake Ellenberger
who has a natural welterweight,

1574
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,260
brutal knockout puncher.

1575
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:41,160
Couldn't put Diego away by the time third
round came along, Diego's on his back,

1576
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:44,070
pounded on him when, when
the last bell rang, you know,

1577
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:48,360
and that a lot of that can be attributed
to his ability to keep up that same

1578
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:51,660
pace. That ruthless pace
doesn't have a lot of muscle.

1579
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:55,350
Well, a lot of it has to do with the type
of nervous system you're born with or

1580
01:31:55,351 --> 01:31:59,530
whether it's an efficient nervous system
or maybe not so efficient you, uh,

1581
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,380
you, uh, they call it
neurological efficiency.

1582
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:05,830
Guys with neurological efficiency are
able to use a lot of their muscle fiber

1583
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:06,520
all at once.

1584
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,780
So there high power guys and guys that
don't have neurological efficiency,

1585
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:13,480
they usually have a high
anaerobic endurance level.

1586
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,630
They just can go and go and go
at a fairly high percentage.

1587
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:20,820
No. Fascinating. Like less efficient.
Yeah. So they have less power.

1588
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,700
They have less power, but they can
go a hoist is a perfect example.

1589
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:26,570
The guy hit unbelievable endurance,
but he, he, you know, he,

1590
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:30,450
he didn't have a lot of fast twitch
muscle fiber. He, he was not a power guy.

1591
01:32:30,850 --> 01:32:34,140
And that's not something that
you can change is it is like,

1592
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:38,990
can you take a guy that's an inborn thing?
So a guy like, uh, you know, like, uh,

1593
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:43,020
Kevin Randleman never going to be a
triathlete. Never, never, never, never.

1594
01:32:43,021 --> 01:32:46,290
Just like most guys are never going
to beat Kevin Randleman, you know,

1595
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:50,100
and all this idea that you can do Olympic
lifting and two selective recruitment

1596
01:32:50,101 --> 01:32:52,840
of muscle fiber. That's, that's
a lot of nonsense man. I,

1597
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:56,720
I've been in this game for a long
time, man. I've never seen that mean.

1598
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,200
Never seen someone who's like ectomorphic
sort of split massively to make you

1599
01:33:01,201 --> 01:33:05,010
more explosive on the mat.
It's, it's a, it's a big
mistake. It doesn't do anything.

1600
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:07,990
Meaning must improve it.
And so any strange ready,

1601
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,670
no matter how God awful is going
to improve, especially beginners.

1602
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:15,960
But as you become more advanced,
man, that explosive weight training,

1603
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,930
it does more harm than good.
Take it from two guys at 61.

1604
01:33:18,931 --> 01:33:23,460
Is that every injury and
the book, have you had, um,

1605
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:27,510
if you had disc injuries, have you ever,
I have. What have you done to fix those?

1606
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:31,440
Uh, I did a lot of inversion
training. Uh, you know,

1607
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:34,690
I used to hang upside down. I
do that. I liked that a lot.

1608
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,850
Of course my role for helped me a lot.

1609
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,610
I've had acupuncture to release some
of that tension in the muscle. Uh, I,

1610
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:45,550
I've done some kind of, uh, uh,
other interesting stuff. I, uh,

1611
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:48,220
I believe in the power of the
subconscious mind to heal the body.

1612
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:53,430
I do a lot of visualization and prayer
and literally a image myself getting

1613
01:33:54,311 --> 01:33:55,750
better.
I believe that your,

1614
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:59,230
your mind and your subconscious mind is
in control of every cell in the body.

1615
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:01,560
And that if you can,
uh,

1616
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:05,160
get rid of any disbeliefs you,
your,

1617
01:34:05,230 --> 01:34:08,140
your higher mind can actually
influence healing in your body.

1618
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:13,540
Wow. That's super unscientific as fans
you to talk about. Well, you know,

1619
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:14,950
as you're fairly scientific guy,

1620
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:19,410
there's a lot we don't know if there's
a very interesting book out right now.

1621
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:22,500
I would really encourage your readers
or your listeners to check it out.

1622
01:34:22,501 --> 01:34:26,190
It's called the healing code.
They talk a lot about how healing code,

1623
01:34:26,191 --> 01:34:30,870
the healing co wrote that. Do you
know, uh, let me see. Johnson,

1624
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:33,210
a guy by the name of John,
there was an MD and a phd.

1625
01:34:33,211 --> 01:34:37,380
They actually wrote the book and they
talk about it in, in the relationship.

1626
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:39,890
Do it like physics and, and, and, and,

1627
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:44,700
and how belief systems
absolutely, uh, affect molecules.

1628
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:45,211
Well,

1629
01:34:45,211 --> 01:34:49,920
the absolutely affect so many different
aspects of your body and for anyone who

1630
01:34:49,921 --> 01:34:52,860
doubts that the placebo
effect is measurable,

1631
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:57,890
I mean the placebo effect is
nothing more than your brain that

1632
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,970
it's got the cure.

1633
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,020
So it reacts as if it's got the cure
and then things get better. I mean,

1634
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:04,610
measurable amounts.

1635
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:09,350
Uh, yeah, I made is amazing. Like how many
studies have shown that placebo effect,

1636
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:14,380
it all comes down to belief system and
believe in yourself and believing that

1637
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:17,030
you have the power to
heal. I mean, you know,

1638
01:35:17,031 --> 01:35:19,450
I don't know whether you're religious
or not, but I mean, you know,

1639
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:22,730
you hear about the miracles of Christ
and you hear that the miracles of other

1640
01:35:22,731 --> 01:35:26,580
profits and so forth. I mean,
you know, it's documented.

1641
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:28,220
A lot of these things happen.

1642
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:29,463
I don't,

1643
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:34,890
I don't buy into anything that's old
when it comes to documentation of certain

1644
01:35:35,321 --> 01:35:38,890
acts because it's so difficult to find
out what the fuck actually happened.

1645
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:43,960
I find religious texts to be fascinating
and enlightening and a lot of ways I

1646
01:35:43,961 --> 01:35:47,080
think you can learn a lot about
what they learned about wisdom,

1647
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,260
what they learned about the correct
path to living a happy, healthy life.

1648
01:35:50,261 --> 01:35:53,650
But a lot of those principles, you
know, the golden rules, the of,

1649
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:58,090
of Christianity, of Islam, of
a lot of different religions,

1650
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:00,520
they essentially comes down to wisdom,

1651
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:02,830
life lessons learned over
long periods of time,

1652
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:07,831
but then translated into sort of some
sort of a weird mez metaphysical deity

1653
01:36:09,881 --> 01:36:13,300
connection that gets a little
sketchy. You know, like, you know,

1654
01:36:13,301 --> 01:36:17,470
Christ rising from the dead and
all this stuff. It's like, boy,

1655
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:18,600
what really happened?
You're,

1656
01:36:18,601 --> 01:36:23,601
you're talking about thousands of years
of stories in over a thousand years

1657
01:36:23,891 --> 01:36:27,330
before anybody wrote anything
down. You know, stories are

1658
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:28,660
the,

1659
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:33,070
most of the things that were written down
were several centuries after the fact.

1660
01:36:33,071 --> 01:36:36,760
So yeah, I agree. But I, I have, uh,

1661
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:40,120
[inaudible] the late 18 hundreds,
early 19 hundreds,

1662
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:43,540
there was a movement in the United
States and through Europe called the new

1663
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:48,280
thought, where people began to
realize that thoughts are things,

1664
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:51,130
it's an energy form.
And that you,

1665
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,280
when you think thanks and
especially when you say things,

1666
01:36:54,281 --> 01:36:58,720
you're actually putting energy into
action. It's the law of attraction.

1667
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,080
So you're basically attracting what you're
putting out. I mean, that's been long.

1668
01:37:02,081 --> 01:37:06,970
I just did in physics. And that's,
that's basically, you know, what, what,

1669
01:37:06,971 --> 01:37:11,190
uh, Einstein was talking about. In what
way was he talking about that? Well,

1670
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:16,450
for every action there's a reaction.
If you're putting out negative thinking,

1671
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,510
negative statements,
you can only attract same.

1672
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:24,670
It's virtually impossible for
any good to come from bad.

1673
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:29,390
Well, it's funny how that sounds so
simplistic, but for anybody or simplistic,

1674
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,630
but anybody who doubts that run
into people that go, oh fuck,

1675
01:37:33,631 --> 01:37:36,230
nothing good ever happens to
me. Those people, you're right,

1676
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:38,570
nothing good ever happens to you.
That's, you know, you have that,

1677
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:41,690
you have this mindset and then you run
into people that say, hey, you know,

1678
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:43,660
we're gonna work through this. We're
going to figure it out, and it's,

1679
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:46,280
this is only gonna make us better and
stronger. Let's keep pushing forward.

1680
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:50,570
Those people seem to always prosper
and I don't know whether or not luck is

1681
01:37:50,571 --> 01:37:53,840
involved. I don't know whether or
not it's all just your attitude,

1682
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:57,060
but I do know that the people
that have that great attitude,

1683
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:59,880
I feel better when I'm
around them and it's,

1684
01:37:59,881 --> 01:38:04,881
it's empowers me and I feel like it
enables me to also spread that empowerment

1685
01:38:05,491 --> 01:38:06,450
on to other folks.

1686
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:09,860
Well, as a whole energy, you know, it's
like, guys, oh, I can't afford this.

1687
01:38:09,861 --> 01:38:11,960
I can't afford that.
You're right. You can't.

1688
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:15,890
It's like going into a fight and
you already thought you lose,

1689
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:16,970
you're going to lose man.

1690
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:20,810
No fighter goes into a fight believing
that he's going to lose the fight.

1691
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,870
If he does go in, he's pretty
much going to get his ass kicked

1692
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:28,130
by. That said, if you're
some guy who's not very good,

1693
01:38:28,131 --> 01:38:31,310
but you've got this crazy belief in
yourself and you fight John fucking Jones,

1694
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:32,960
you're still gonna get your ass kicked.

1695
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:36,800
And it only works up to a certain
point up to a certain point, they guys,

1696
01:38:36,801 --> 01:38:39,390
then there's other factors that
come into town. There's a lot of

1697
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,560
the, the, the, the positive belief system
has to be grounded in reality. Yes. Right.

1698
01:38:44,561 --> 01:38:47,310
Yeah. Obviously if I, you know,

1699
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:51,100
if somehow I could be convinced that I
could fly and I jump off this building,

1700
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,180
I'm going to go splat.

1701
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:54,880
Yeah. And the, the, the, you
know, people that are into like,

1702
01:38:54,881 --> 01:38:57,040
the secret will tell you,
you didn't really believe

1703
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:02,950
well, May, who knows, man, you
know, I, I've my belief system,

1704
01:39:02,951 --> 01:39:06,940
does it go past a certain point?
But maybe that's my limiting factor.

1705
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:08,740
But I do know when it comes to the body,

1706
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:13,150
you have an amazing
capacity for self healing.

1707
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:16,990
And I, I've actually
undergone it with my own body.

1708
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:22,030
Well, the people that really,
truly believe that we are
in some way or another,

1709
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:26,920
the vehicle of God that is there,

1710
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:29,440
that's sort of what they point to.

1711
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:34,570
That we manifest our reality with our
own mind and our own intent and with our

1712
01:39:34,571 --> 01:39:36,250
own actions and our own thoughts.

1713
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:41,550
And that as we grow and as we evolved
and as we get stronger and stronger with

1714
01:39:42,071 --> 01:39:44,170
our consciousness and our
ability to understand this,

1715
01:39:44,171 --> 01:39:48,840
that we enact those powers more
freely and more consciously and, uh,

1716
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:52,600
that, that our intent truly does
create they're very universe around us.

1717
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:57,340
It sounds a little ridiculous,
but then when you start and think what,

1718
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,700
how much of an effect human
beings have on the environment?

1719
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:02,770
How much of an affect
human beings have on earth?

1720
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:05,830
And when you stop and think about all
the bad things that go on in earth,

1721
01:40:05,831 --> 01:40:09,430
whether it's war or pollution or
what is that? It's like there's this,

1722
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:14,640
there's a lack of attention and a lack
of intent on the important aspects of

1723
01:40:15,161 --> 01:40:17,410
harmonious relationships
with your environment,

1724
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:22,840
whether it's with people or let's take
like just one small example of like how

1725
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,400
my belief system works about this.
Uh,

1726
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:29,750
there's this one thing called the
accumulation mindset. I call it, uh,

1727
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:34,780
I work online with people on fat loss
programs and when you really look at their

1728
01:40:36,351 --> 01:40:37,184
lifestyle,

1729
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:41,450
their into the z accumulation mode of
just buying an amassing all this stuff.

1730
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:45,740
I've been in some people's homes where
the shelves are just littered with stuff

1731
01:40:45,741 --> 01:40:50,180
they never use or don't need. You know,
they, they just have so much stuff.

1732
01:40:50,181 --> 01:40:52,400
The attic is full of stuff,
the garage is full of stuff,

1733
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:55,660
but they buying more and more,
adding, adding, adding, adding.

1734
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,750
Their bodies reflect this
type of belief system.

1735
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:03,640
And for sure they're adding more cells
under their body. Just indulge it,

1736
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:05,890
you know?
And then they find themselves over eating,

1737
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:10,930
eating more than their fair share of
the natural resources of the universe.

1738
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,090
Taking more n a,
I mean,

1739
01:41:13,091 --> 01:41:16,960
it's just like this whole
belief system in accumulation.

1740
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:20,770
Like I need to add, I need to add
is all subconscious. Of course,

1741
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:21,850
no one goes into it.

1742
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:26,090
Yeah. I have friends that are overweight
and when I watched them sometimes eat,

1743
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:29,870
I almost see like a person who's
a consuming a drug, you know,

1744
01:41:29,871 --> 01:41:32,780
you see them like they know they shouldn't
have it, but they're like, fuck it.

1745
01:41:32,781 --> 01:41:37,520
Give it to me. Uh, a relief, you
know? And I don't know what it is,

1746
01:41:37,521 --> 01:41:40,190
whether it's a distraction
from their own mortality,

1747
01:41:40,191 --> 01:41:44,430
whether it was just some sort of a
weird hitch in the system of though the,

1748
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:46,790
the way the mind interacts with the world.

1749
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:50,930
Like it's just too much stress and too
many variables and they need something to

1750
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:55,130
sort of inject them out of that. So they
focus entirely on an ice cream Sundae.

1751
01:41:55,131 --> 01:41:58,130
But Eh, knowing that they
shouldn't even have it, go fuck it.

1752
01:41:58,131 --> 01:42:00,380
We're going to have it anyway.
And so by doing that,

1753
01:42:00,381 --> 01:42:05,060
you sort of block off all your awareness
and just funnel that stuff down your

1754
01:42:05,061 --> 01:42:07,160
fucking pie hole until you're,

1755
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,460
it's like an addiction to the pleasure
centers of the body. You know,

1756
01:42:10,461 --> 01:42:11,700
you get like that little drug,

1757
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:15,410
lack of response in the brain for a
moment in time, you know, when do you,

1758
01:42:15,411 --> 01:42:16,490
when you eat this kind of stuff.

1759
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:20,030
And so you get like that little chemical
reward that the brain puts out for

1760
01:42:20,031 --> 01:42:23,930
having like this big thing is sugar or
whatever. You know, you get that rush,

1761
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:29,180
but then there's quickly replaced
with either disgust or south loathing,

1762
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:33,560
but sets up another cycle because
now you get depressed again.

1763
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:37,970
But you need that little brain reward
and man, it can be pretty tough.

1764
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:41,090
And it really parallels with
gambling addiction, right? Yeah.

1765
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:45,200
Well I mean same sort of thing. Very
common. I mean if you think about it,

1766
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:48,140
you can kick cigarettes,
you can kick most drugs.

1767
01:42:48,141 --> 01:42:50,570
It's cigarettes are tough for most people.

1768
01:42:50,571 --> 01:42:52,520
One of the toughest things
you give up is that nicotine.

1769
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:56,840
But any drug you can give up, you can
get off alcohol. All those things. Right,

1770
01:42:57,170 --> 01:43:01,010
but you don't need those things,
but you do need to eat. Food.

1771
01:43:01,011 --> 01:43:04,970
Addiction is very common and it's the
toughest one to give up because you can

1772
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:06,320
never not eat.

1773
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:09,180
That's a very good point. It's a
very good way of putting it. I don't,

1774
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,230
I don't think I've ever heard
anybody put it that way.

1775
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:16,160
It's such an important way to describe
it because you'll always get to know.

1776
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,520
It's like if you were a heroin
addict and you go, okay,

1777
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:22,490
I can't just shoot up until I pass out.
I'm just going to shoot a little bit.

1778
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:27,940
Keep Pamper happy. Yeah. I mean
that's really similar. You need it.

1779
01:43:27,941 --> 01:43:31,210
You need food if you don't, and if you're
addicted to food and you need food.

1780
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:34,690
Yeah. I've had friends who lost a lot of
weight and they look great and like, Oh,

1781
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:35,960
you look great.
You lost all this weight.

1782
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:40,450
Well, a year later, so he said,
well, think of it as a species.

1783
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:44,110
Our survival depended on our belt.
The lay down in a rapidly I body fat.

1784
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:46,540
We were programmed,
overeat,

1785
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:51,680
and eat as much as possible because
food was not very prevalent right now in

1786
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:52,130
this modern

1787
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:56,900
society with food, you know,
so easily to get, I mean,

1788
01:43:56,901 --> 01:44:01,490
our genetics actually work
against us while it's probably
like why sex addiction,

1789
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,790
this exists as well too,
like your,

1790
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:08,660
it was hard for human beings to breed
and even harder for them to stay alive.

1791
01:44:08,661 --> 01:44:12,860
So it was imperative that we breed as
much as possible to spread the population

1792
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:13,940
as far as possible.

1793
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:19,060
And so that that pleasure reward system
that's in place to make sure that you

1794
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:25,150
keep breeding and just throw is a hiccup
gets thrown into it when you inject it

1795
01:44:25,311 --> 01:44:28,430
into modern society where you don't
really have as many issues about breeding,

1796
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:32,270
but he's still have this genetic
impulse to constantly need to,

1797
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:36,860
to fuck and spread your seat.
Yeah. Yeah. Stuff. Your face breed.

1798
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:40,700
But I don't get the gambling
one. The gambling one's a
weird one, right? Where the,

1799
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:42,010
where the hell did that one come from?

1800
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,600
That's still a brain reward and you get
that rush, that excitement. You know, why?

1801
01:44:46,601 --> 01:44:51,110
Why would I guess to take risks in the
rewards of what these guys needed to get

1802
01:44:51,111 --> 01:44:55,490
out and do a sport and replace it with
that. But instead they get it from the,

1803
01:44:55,670 --> 01:45:00,440
the rush of, you know, putting it all
in the line. But yeah. Well I mean,

1804
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:04,400
think of like some of the
adrenaline sports like rock
climbing. So it was crazy.

1805
01:45:04,401 --> 01:45:08,390
Dudes like climate without
safety harnesses or Alex handled.

1806
01:45:08,391 --> 01:45:12,940
We had him on the podcast. We have
the craziest of all. One Kid, uh,

1807
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:17,090
the, the one free climber just died
recently, but that's just one who died.

1808
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:19,880
There was a guy who was
written in outside magazine.

1809
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:23,200
They did a little tribute to this
guy. But hope is not Alex. I have no,

1810
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:26,360
I would have heard of Alex Todd because
he's the craziest of all of them.

1811
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,880
We had them on the podcast.
He's the most mellow kid ever.

1812
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:30,920
But think about the base jumping.

1813
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:34,200
There's two crazy dudes that jumped
off that tower and Dubai, you know,

1814
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:39,590
that's sad. But that's the type of, you
know, adrenaline rush. But you know,

1815
01:45:39,591 --> 01:45:43,990
like guys like you and me, we
get that going on the mat. Yeah.

1816
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,640
Yeah. That's, I think that is a big thing.

1817
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:50,000
The pushing yourself and the reward of,

1818
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,460
and that's the difference
between a martial art as well.

1819
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,120
Then really in my opinion,

1820
01:45:54,121 --> 01:45:56,750
the difference in Jujitsu as opposed
to all the other martial arts.

1821
01:45:56,751 --> 01:46:01,751
Because I enjoyed kickboxing
and I enjoyed taekwondo.

1822
01:46:01,911 --> 01:46:05,780
I enjoyed, uh, competing. I
certainly got a lot out of it.

1823
01:46:05,781 --> 01:46:07,160
It's certainly shaped me as a man,

1824
01:46:07,161 --> 01:46:10,040
but I never felt good when
I knocked somebody out.

1825
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:14,270
I always felt weird to the body. Wasn't
that bad. It didn't bother me that much.

1826
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:18,020
But man, when I, when I would head
kick guys and watch them fold,

1827
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:22,850
it was a terrible feeling. Pretty sick.
I've never enjoyed it. I never felt good.

1828
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,260
And even worse when you get head
care. Yeah, way worse. I got lucky.

1829
01:46:27,261 --> 01:46:32,261
I got stopped only once in
my entire career and it was
a kickboxing bound and it

1830
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:36,200
was more out of exhaustion than anything.
It was the third fight in, in the night.

1831
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:39,920
I won my first one by Kao,
I wanted my second one.

1832
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:44,960
It was a two, went to two a two
round. Both of them were too. It was,

1833
01:46:44,961 --> 01:46:48,110
cause you fought three times in the night.
So there were two round fights. So, uh,

1834
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,990
first one on one by Saquon was just a,
a kick the guy's ass.

1835
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:56,280
But then I had a long period of break
between the second find the third,

1836
01:46:56,281 --> 01:47:00,440
and I was just fucking exhausted and
I was kind of sick too. And then, uh,

1837
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,630
I got hit with a left hook and the second
round and my, my legs just gave out.

1838
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:06,360
But I was conscious it was nothing bad.
It was like,

1839
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:09,750
and then that was the last fight I had
and I was in the middle of like doing

1840
01:47:09,751 --> 01:47:12,240
comedy and competing at the same
time. I was saying, you know what,

1841
01:47:12,241 --> 01:47:15,390
if I can get out of this with thinking
about all the shit that I did to people,

1842
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:17,430
if I can get out of it with
just one left hook to the face,

1843
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:20,820
because my instinct initially was,
I'm not going on a loss. Fuck that.

1844
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,340
I'm coming back. I'm going to find that
guy, I'm gonna beat the fuck out of him.

1845
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:26,960
And my initial instinct was to start
training like a fucking madman,

1846
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:29,820
abandoned comedy,
but that was emotional.

1847
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:33,870
Within a week or two I sort of realized
I have a different comment since that's

1848
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:35,990
it. I realized I had a
different goal too that I,

1849
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:40,740
I changed the way I train and I wasn't
training like I was when I was younger

1850
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,950
and when I was completely
obsessed with competition.

1851
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,350
Now I had all these
different requirements.

1852
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:50,490
I was now no longer live with my parents
now I was feeding myself when I was

1853
01:47:50,491 --> 01:47:53,070
working and I was worried about my future.
I was like,

1854
01:47:53,071 --> 01:47:55,680
what am I going to do for a living?
Like what am I doing here? I'm teaching,

1855
01:47:55,681 --> 01:47:58,830
there's not much money in that. And
I go, what am I doing? I'm like,

1856
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:02,130
be a kickboxer and get fucking brain
damage. So it was all these very,

1857
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:07,170
so I was terrified that I was going to
run into me when I was 19 who was just a

1858
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:11,280
psycho that just trained constantly and
lived at home and didn't have many bills.

1859
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:15,540
And just every day I'd get up and run
hills and stairs and just all I was

1860
01:48:15,541 --> 01:48:18,690
thinking of is I got to do things that
other people aren't doing because that

1861
01:48:18,691 --> 01:48:21,210
way I'll win, you know, and
I wasn't doing that anymore.

1862
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:22,890
So I kind of recognized
it was always like,

1863
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:25,980
if I can get away with one loss like that,
like that kind of loss.

1864
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:30,660
We're good because I didn't want anybody
kicking me the way I kicked people.

1865
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:35,040
I just fucking, I've seen it happen
to friends to like good friend Mike,

1866
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:39,240
my friend Larry, he when we were like,
um, he was a little bit older than me,

1867
01:48:39,241 --> 01:48:42,810
I think I was 18 and we went to this
tournament and he fought this Canadian

1868
01:48:42,811 --> 01:48:46,410
national champion that's Kinda named
Jersey long and he got hit with an ax kick

1869
01:48:46,411 --> 01:48:48,600
in the head and I'll never forget it.

1870
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:53,810
I'll never forget watching this guy whip
his leg up like more than a split and

1871
01:48:54,961 --> 01:48:58,740
slam that heel down on my friend's
face and he just crumpled.

1872
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:03,000
And I was like, Dad, it's just not
something I ever want to happen to me.

1873
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:06,180
It's a brutal way to make a living.
And when you do it to somebody,

1874
01:49:06,181 --> 01:49:09,180
it doesn't feel good. When you choke
someone out in Jujitsu and they tap,

1875
01:49:09,181 --> 01:49:13,020
it doesn't feel bad at all, you
know? Yeah. You're not hurting him.

1876
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:17,130
I'm never broken anybody's arm. I mean,
I've never been in, in class. I've never,

1877
01:49:17,131 --> 01:49:19,740
I mean, I've seen guys
get injured, you know,

1878
01:49:19,741 --> 01:49:23,850
accidentally knees blowout and stuff
like that, but it's always an accident.

1879
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,330
It's never, you know, never an
intentional thing, at least on my behalf.

1880
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:32,400
So I never felt bad about it. So I got
all that. The competition to thrill,

1881
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:34,770
the energy, the excitement,
all the discharge,

1882
01:49:34,771 --> 01:49:39,090
the adrenaline without any of the bad
Karma feelings that you get from kicking

1883
01:49:39,091 --> 01:49:43,050
somebody, you know? Because
there's something about, you know,

1884
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:46,290
that kind of competition
where you have to put almost,

1885
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:50,590
you have to put your humanity
aside in order to, to compete in,

1886
01:49:50,610 --> 01:49:54,460
in a mixed martial arts or
in, so I tell people, like,

1887
01:49:54,461 --> 01:49:56,380
when people come to me
for advice about fighting,

1888
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:58,390
while I'm thinking about fighting,
we'll stop right there.

1889
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:02,560
Because if you're just thinking about
it, don't fucking do it. Okay? If you,

1890
01:50:02,561 --> 01:50:07,561
if you have to be completely obsessed
and if you're not completely obsessed,

1891
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:10,810
you're going to fight someone who is
and you're going to get fucking killed.

1892
01:50:10,930 --> 01:50:14,770
Think about someone who's not completely
obsessed fighting Vandelay Silva in his

1893
01:50:14,771 --> 01:50:19,030
prime. Just imagine that. Okay, and then
do you want that to happen to you? No.

1894
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:22,870
Then don't do it. But if you want to be
Vandelay Silva, if that's your destiny,

1895
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:25,450
then do it. But it, unless
that's your destiny,

1896
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:28,260
unless that is you and I don't
know what the fuck anybody,

1897
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:31,000
I don't know what makes someone want
to be a folk singer. I don't get it.

1898
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:32,283
I don't understand.

1899
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,070
Someone has it in their head to get up
every morning and do macrame and that's

1900
01:50:36,071 --> 01:50:39,310
what they want to do.
That I would never discourage it,

1901
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:43,330
but you must have that in your head.
If you want to be a fighter,

1902
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:46,630
you have to only have that in your head.
If you have anything in your head,

1903
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:50,590
any doubts. If you have any problem
with giving people concussions, get out.

1904
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:53,350
Don't do it because
you're going to run it.

1905
01:50:53,351 --> 01:50:57,610
I don't believe in dabbling and
fighting. You can't not do it. Oh,

1906
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,680
it's uh,
like you say,

1907
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:03,580
the risk to benefit ratio of that type of

1908
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,840
activity. It's just, it's just terrible.

1909
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:12,930
So when you've had injuries and you
have done what you say is a prayer and

1910
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,230
meditation and focusing,
what is the process?

1911
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:20,190
Do you put yourself in a
certain particular state
when you're trying to heal

1912
01:51:20,191 --> 01:51:23,640
something? Like how do you go about
doing it? That's really famous.

1913
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,990
A guy by the name of Neville Goddard who,
uh,

1914
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:30,740
wrote about the power of visualization.
A lot of it has to do with visualization.

1915
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:35,360
Visualizing yourself as whole as being,
well, uh, you know, there's like a,

1916
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:39,260
like there's a, you know, we're all
born with this perfect DNA blueprint,

1917
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:44,150
but then we get skewed somehow as we get
older or through injuries and set forth.

1918
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,090
So I try to visualize
like being like that,

1919
01:51:47,091 --> 01:51:52,040
that perfect little kid that had full
mobility and ability to move and so forth.

1920
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:54,050
And there's the step by step process.

1921
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:59,380
You literally generate the feeling of
being that fighters did this all the time.

1922
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:04,260
You know, they are are great
athletes, like, uh, you know, uh,

1923
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:06,890
John Mcenroe or somebody, you
know, they, they, they're able,

1924
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:11,950
they had this power to
visualize themselves in certain
situations and prevailing

1925
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:15,920
or, or winning. And I mean
in, in all walks of life.

1926
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:18,010
Well,
I certainly know use visuals,

1927
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:21,410
whether they know it or not,
even if they're unconscious of it,

1928
01:52:21,411 --> 01:52:22,244
they're still using it.

1929
01:52:22,590 --> 01:52:25,460
Yeah. There's certain folks that just,
they have super confident and they,

1930
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:27,900
I only see myself winning,
but there's other folks,

1931
01:52:27,901 --> 01:52:31,620
like I know frank shamrock talked about
that a lot that he used to go through.

1932
01:52:31,621 --> 01:52:35,460
He was a big proponent of visualization
and when he was in his prime and he

1933
01:52:35,461 --> 01:52:38,310
would go through all these different
scenarios and see himself winning,

1934
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:40,710
go through all these different
scenarios. A lot of people, you know,

1935
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:43,740
don't give frank shamrock enough credit.
Like back in the day,

1936
01:52:43,741 --> 01:52:47,690
frank was the well balanced
mixed martial artists. I mean,

1937
01:52:47,691 --> 01:52:51,470
he was a fantastic fighter. I never in
this era match you had was Enovia man.

1938
01:52:51,610 --> 01:52:54,890
Oh yeah. Woo Man. Yeah, that
was a quick one. You know,

1939
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:58,010
that was a crazy slam and he broke
his collarbone. Fucked him up.

1940
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:01,300
I just, that devastating Aa
pickup throw he did. Right.

1941
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:03,660
Frank was an animal. Yeah.
Well how about, you know,

1942
01:53:03,661 --> 01:53:07,170
when he beat Kevin Jackson with that
arm bar in Japan to win the title? No.

1943
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:11,970
You know, at the time he beat
uh, uh, who was the, the bad boy,

1944
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:16,680
Tito Ortiz. She had already days cardio
dance. He was way smaller than, you know,

1945
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:21,420
he used Jujitsu. He basically was
repeatedly taken down by Tito Ortiz.

1946
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:26,010
Use the guard as good as any Jujitsu guy
I've ever seen. We get back to his feet.

1947
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:30,060
Tito got tired of taking him down and he
couldn't do anything with them cause he

1948
01:53:30,061 --> 01:53:34,050
used beautiful guard work. I was
shocked at how good is she just, it was,

1949
01:53:34,290 --> 01:53:37,950
well that was an important fight for MMA
as well because that was an important

1950
01:53:37,951 --> 01:53:42,180
fight where people understood the benefit
and then the need for cardio because

1951
01:53:42,181 --> 01:53:44,370
frank had tremendous cardio.

1952
01:53:44,371 --> 01:53:48,510
Frank was also training with
Maury Smith who was a huge,

1953
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:53,080
huge cardio fiend. Maurice would
swim. He was an animal, he would just,

1954
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:57,450
he would put those weird paddle things
on your hands and just do lap after lap.

1955
01:53:57,570 --> 01:54:00,870
And that's how he wound up beating
Mark Coleman. Same strategy.

1956
01:54:00,871 --> 01:54:02,730
Mark Coleman took them
down over and over again.

1957
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:06,600
Maurice defended while he was on the
bottom and then eventually got up and he

1958
01:54:06,601 --> 01:54:10,280
was fresh still cause it's cardio was
so good. Mark was exhausted than more,

1959
01:54:10,281 --> 01:54:12,540
he started kicking the shit
out of his legs. You know,

1960
01:54:12,541 --> 01:54:16,590
Maurice implied that strategy applied
rather that strategy many times.

1961
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:20,940
And you know, I think frank learned a
lot from Maurice in that respect too.

1962
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:24,570
But that fight was a big,
when you think about how,

1963
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:28,230
how young MMA was back then, I
mean, when did he fight Tito?

1964
01:54:28,231 --> 01:54:30,890
Was at 96 or something like that,
somewhere around there.

1965
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:33,330
It was really in the early days.
Really in the early day.

1966
01:54:33,331 --> 01:54:36,120
So three or four years into the UFC?
No,

1967
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:39,780
it must've been after 96 because I
was there for Tito's first fight,

1968
01:54:39,781 --> 01:54:44,130
which was 97. I was there, um, uh, west.

1969
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:47,820
All Britain, I think he fought. He
came in as an alternate. I was there,

1970
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:51,690
I interviewed him, I think he
was 19 at the time. And uh,

1971
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:56,870
and he won in that fight and then he
got submitted by Guy Metzker Guy Metzger

1972
01:54:57,121 --> 01:55:00,120
caught him in a guillotine. And then, um,

1973
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:04,800
he went on to, uh, when he fought
frank shamrock after that fight,

1974
01:55:04,801 --> 01:55:09,120
he became a cardio machine cardio machine.
And he taught a lot of guys that,

1975
01:55:09,121 --> 01:55:11,700
like when I talked to Kendall
Grove after Kendall did,

1976
01:55:11,701 --> 01:55:14,100
Tom and the ultimate fighter came
out like a much improved fighter.

1977
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,800
And one of the thing that he said to me,
Kendall said,

1978
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:20,410
I learned from Tito that cardio is
everything. You know, these guys learned.

1979
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:24,540
We saw that the growth, you know,
we saw these guys learning like,

1980
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:28,150
well I sure as often as the sport. Well,
you know, I, I don't know what that,

1981
01:55:28,151 --> 01:55:30,730
I ever told you this, but I was one
of the original investors in the UFC.

1982
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:33,170
My actual DC Maxwell. Yes. Or,

1983
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:37,550
and Gracie puts that first UFC together
to shoestring budget in Denver. Wow.

1984
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:40,600
And he was going around to all his friends
and we were all kicking in a little

1985
01:55:40,601 --> 01:55:44,160
bit of money and you know, I had a
little extra money saved up. I, I

1986
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,070
actually had a retirement account as
a school teacher and I had some money

1987
01:55:47,071 --> 01:55:48,450
sitting in the bank. I said, sure.

1988
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,880
And so he went to like a whole
bunch of different people,

1989
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:54,390
put it together on a shoestring
and thus was born that first UFC.

1990
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:59,570
And he wanted to use it as a showcase
to show the superiority of Jujitsu or

1991
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:03,360
basically what happens here if you
don't know how to find in the ground.

1992
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:07,800
And then he picked the most unlikely guy
cause he could add Hickson who was just

1993
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:11,310
a stunned, but he was afraid that
people say, wow, that's excellent.

1994
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:13,320
Look at the physique,
looking to athleticism.

1995
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:17,790
He wanted to pick a voice who was
a really nice kid, pretty thin,

1996
01:56:17,791 --> 01:56:19,020
wasn't particularly strong.

1997
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:23,340
He was perfect God to showcase
the technique of Jujitsu.

1998
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:27,570
There's also that what I'd heard was
that he couldn't control Hickson and they

1999
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:32,190
didn't like that. Hixon [inaudible]
wild man. Yeah, he's his own man.

2000
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:38,010
He wasn't going to tell them what to do.
And voice was a very young naive kid.

2001
01:56:38,011 --> 01:56:40,080
And you know, he's pretty, yeah,

2002
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:44,130
he pretty much listened to what Horry
and told him to do and it just makes it

2003
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:46,590
amazing what he did in this first UFC is,

2004
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:49,710
but the big difference was the no gloves.

2005
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:53,670
Every one was breaking their
hands. Yup. And I'm telling you,

2006
01:56:53,671 --> 01:56:54,840
you take the gloves off,

2007
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:58,140
you would still see wrestlers and
Jujitsu guys went almost every fight.

2008
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:01,200
But for the average audience,
I think it would be boring.

2009
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:05,580
I want to see the spectacular
knockouts and you know,

2010
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:08,670
you're not going to get this particular
knockouts with the bare fist like you

2011
01:57:08,671 --> 01:57:11,540
would with those gloves would
with knees. And uh, you know,

2012
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:15,090
for sure ties advanced Ligo.

2013
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:19,020
We had Orlando Veit who's like one of the,
the best early guys.

2014
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:23,280
Striker answers are really high level
kickboxer who was in the early UFC.

2015
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:28,020
But um, I, I agree with you. You wouldn't
see nearly as much punching to the face.

2016
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:31,320
You, your hands break. All guys would
have to do is just duck their head down.

2017
01:57:31,321 --> 01:57:34,890
You hit their forehead, you know, if you
want to punch me in the forehead, shit,

2018
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:39,000
go ahead. Go for it. Nice to be hedging
strategy and self defense. You know,

2019
01:57:39,001 --> 01:57:42,060
he just like Headbutt the hand
and it's pretty much done then.

2020
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:45,900
But the other thing too was with the no
time limit thing that they had back in

2021
01:57:45,901 --> 01:57:48,070
those days,
you know where you'd just go and get that.

2022
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:51,900
That was very terrifying for a
lot of guys. Oh my God. You know,

2023
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,480
I feel my gas going and
people were just literally,

2024
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,290
you can't recover panic now there there's
no sitting on a stool ice bag on the

2025
01:57:58,291 --> 01:58:01,590
back of your neck, have a sip of
water. Someone who's picky feet up,

2026
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:04,110
relaxing your legs and none of that,
you know,

2027
01:58:04,111 --> 01:58:07,290
you just gotta fucking mark her on top
of you dropping elbows in your face.

2028
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:11,080
They hair pool and they had the
punching to the testicle. I mean,

2029
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:12,930
it really was.

2030
01:58:12,931 --> 01:58:16,710
And that it really is amazing what hoists
accomplished when you think about that.

2031
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:20,370
We don't fuck three or four
times in one night. Gee,

2032
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:24,690
it's impossible under
estimate to underemphasize it.

2033
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:29,520
I mean, or or over emphasize it. What
an amazing thing he accomplished.

2034
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:33,150
It really truly is.
And that fight he had with Matt Hughes,

2035
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:35,250
that wasn't the same
hoists, Gracie, you know,

2036
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:40,310
I mean that was pretty much him past
his prime and addition to wearing gloves

2037
01:58:40,591 --> 01:58:42,070
and not wearing the key.
I mean it

2038
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,180
was just everything.

2039
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:47,800
I know he must have felt incredibly
uncomfortable in that particular fight,

2040
01:58:47,910 --> 01:58:48,240
you know?

2041
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:51,660
Well he was also fighting a
monster and we, Matt uses in March,

2042
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:55,980
he was fighting a monster at 175 pounds.
He didn't want to lose the weight.

2043
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:58,590
So he let Matt Hughes
be even fucking bigger.

2044
01:58:58,830 --> 01:59:03,240
And Matt Hughes is a God damn gorilla
and has really good Jujitsu. Mad.

2045
01:59:03,241 --> 01:59:05,070
He was just him.
I mean,

2046
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:07,380
that was the thing about what Matt
Hughes did to him in that fight.

2047
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:10,500
He took voices fucking back
flatten amount was pounding on him.

2048
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:14,530
The fight ended with Matt Hughes having
both of his hooks in on top of him

2049
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:19,510
because he jujitsu when hoisted it guys
thousands of times and he was Oco real.

2050
01:59:19,511 --> 01:59:22,470
Ah,
Matthew is back then was a gorilla.

2051
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,460
He had these neck muscles,
like you look at the back of his neck,

2052
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:30,480
it's like he's got to kill bosses,
don't even kill bosses.

2053
01:59:30,481 --> 01:59:33,180
Like what of those look
really fat Salamis,

2054
01:59:33,290 --> 01:59:38,160
you know that go from the base of the
spine outward towards the traps and he's

2055
01:59:38,161 --> 01:59:40,710
such a fucking animal with good technique.

2056
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:43,690
Good technique, great techniques.
By the way, some of the guys,

2057
01:59:43,691 --> 01:59:45,940
sometimes guys as far apart as I saw it,
like a video clip,

2058
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:51,190
it was like a WHO's who of like high
level Jujitsu guys and he was more than

2059
01:59:51,191 --> 01:59:54,730
handling this outfit in the, in
digital row. Yeah. And He'd already,

2060
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:57,990
Ben threw scraps with guys like Bj Penn.

2061
01:59:58,110 --> 02:00:02,400
He had trained on a regular basis with a,
you know, really, really high level guys,

2062
02:00:02,401 --> 02:00:04,910
both at Pat and Mila touches
and other gym, you know,

2063
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:08,430
I mean he had guys to train
with them on a, he's just,

2064
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,670
he was constantly around
guys that were like really,

2065
02:00:11,671 --> 02:00:14,640
really high level and he's
being pushed in title fights,

2066
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:18,600
who's being pushed and like, and hoist
had been out of the game for quite awhile,

2067
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:21,980
but boy did that sell. You know,
everybody wanted to see it.

2068
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:26,680
Everyone wanted to say it. But to
me it was, uh, it was kind of sad.

2069
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:30,530
It was, well, you know, hoist was
really a hero to me. You know,

2070
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:34,560
I just hated to see if,
because people sort of undermine at him.

2071
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:37,970
I C G g a UFC is,
uh,

2072
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:40,690
becomes so much more
sophisticated and look,

2073
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:43,420
there's old ones you can never
hang with these guys. That's,

2074
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:46,100
that's not true at all,
man. It was just, well,

2075
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:49,260
it had been really interesting to
see hoists in his prime was picky.

2076
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:53,620
The versus Matt Hughes. That would have
been, yeah, it would've been interesting.

2077
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:54,561
But it's also,

2078
02:00:54,561 --> 02:00:57,500
you've got to realize that one of the
reasons why Matt Hughes was so good is it

2079
02:00:57,501 --> 02:01:02,180
Matt Hughes had benefited from all the
lessons that we had all learned voice

2080
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:06,620
from boys entering into UFC one UFC
two. And then of course, Jeremy Horn,

2081
02:01:06,621 --> 02:01:09,620
who was training all the time with Matt,
who was a huge student of the game.

2082
02:01:09,621 --> 02:01:11,210
And one of the most technical guys,

2083
02:01:11,211 --> 02:01:15,080
like Jeremy Horn is a perfect example
because Jeremy is a really smart guy.

2084
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:18,140
No Ego who has a body that is just,

2085
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:22,820
there's nothing super powerful
or unusually athletic,

2086
02:01:22,821 --> 02:01:24,440
nothing extra long about him.

2087
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,560
Just excellent technique and
intelligence and you know,

2088
02:01:27,561 --> 02:01:30,640
he worked a lot with Matt.
Matt got to, you know,

2089
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:33,560
learn a lot of techniques from him.
The BJ Penn fights of course,

2090
02:01:33,561 --> 02:01:37,850
Bj Penn Moon Dealz champion, one of
the best Jujitsu guys ever. Guys ever.

2091
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:40,100
And so he mad at,
you know,

2092
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:42,680
the, the game past toys up, you know,

2093
02:01:42,681 --> 02:01:45,980
that things had changed and
his body wasn't the same. Yeah.

2094
02:01:45,981 --> 02:01:50,070
It became a real bonafide sport.
I think those early, early UFC is,

2095
02:01:50,071 --> 02:01:53,090
we're pretty much like real fights
and like street fights, you know,

2096
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:57,140
you know how they used to try out for,
this is crazy man.

2097
02:01:57,380 --> 02:02:00,320
I was actually caught into the
ballroom by horror end one time.

2098
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:04,220
They had guys trying out for the UFC in
the ballroom and they'd get hilly and

2099
02:02:04,221 --> 02:02:08,360
Gracie and they would have a
couple of other, the Gracie family,

2100
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:13,280
they would put on a knee pads and
fight in these hotel ballrooms.

2101
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:18,050
Whoa. Yeah. To see if it was bare
knuckle they would just go, man, wow.

2102
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,630
It was a whole mine to find
out if a guy's any good.

2103
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:23,800
There's all Gracie in action tapes to find
out if the guy was any good. And yeah,

2104
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:27,140
they know the early uh, ultimate
fighters, you know, they have,

2105
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:27,861
they would have a guy,

2106
02:02:27,861 --> 02:02:32,120
they had guys fighting the early ultimate
fighters that had no fights. Zero.

2107
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:36,080
And they would get those guys and
they would have them hit the pads.

2108
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:38,680
They'd have a guy hold a
tie pads farm. Okay, got it.

2109
02:02:38,681 --> 02:02:41,300
Got some striking techniques and they'd
have them roll a little bit. Okay.

2110
02:02:41,301 --> 02:02:42,050
It looks like he could roll,

2111
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:44,390
get in there and then they put him
on the ultimate fighter. I mean,

2112
02:02:44,391 --> 02:02:48,350
there's quite a few guys that they had
to did that of really ultimately of

2113
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:50,390
course as the show evolved,
like all things,

2114
02:02:50,391 --> 02:02:52,370
but now you're getting
guys like Uriah Hall,

2115
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:55,480
they come into the ultimate
fighter already a killer, you know,

2116
02:02:55,481 --> 02:02:58,820
and just lighting guys on fire when
they get in there. The fascinating,

2117
02:02:58,821 --> 02:03:02,690
fascinating to be a part of the
evolution of all of that really.

2118
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:05,390
And you know that the training has really
evolved to that was going to ask you

2119
02:03:05,391 --> 02:03:09,710
about that. Let's talk for example about
you mentioned muscularity and straight.

2120
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:12,310
How much would you need to
be by suppression? Right?

2121
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:16,340
Well obviously it's a weight class
sport and you wouldn't be as light as

2122
02:03:16,341 --> 02:03:18,500
possible and as strong
as absolutely possible.

2123
02:03:18,501 --> 02:03:20,420
So absolute strength is pretty important.

2124
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:24,050
There's a fixed ratio between absolute
strength and muscular endurance.

2125
02:03:24,051 --> 02:03:25,610
Strength is a fixed ratio,

2126
02:03:25,611 --> 02:03:30,440
so if you increase your ability to
lift a really heavy weight one time,

2127
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:34,220
your endurance with a lighter
weight is going to also improve.

2128
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Let's say you managed to build from 80
pounds to 100 pounds and a bicep curl,

2129
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:45,230
and prior to that you could take 50 pounds
and maybe you could do 10 when you go

2130
02:03:45,231 --> 02:03:49,250
from your 82 year a hundred pounds curl,
your ability to,

2131
02:03:49,251 --> 02:03:51,920
if you went back to that same 50
pants that you could do 10 with,

2132
02:03:51,921 --> 02:03:54,050
you probably do about 13 or 14 reps now.

2133
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:57,590
So there's a fixed ratio between
strength and muscular endurance.

2134
02:03:57,830 --> 02:04:00,800
That's interesting. So if you do
chin ups, like say if you can do,

2135
02:04:00,801 --> 02:04:04,000
I can do 20 chin-ups.
That's pretty remarkable by it.

2136
02:04:04,001 --> 02:04:06,910
That's always been like an amazing
standard. Well you kind of stuff,

2137
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:10,910
I always tell people, listen,
I learned a lot from you. Um,

2138
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:14,630
but if I did it with a weight
belt, you know, like a um,

2139
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:19,970
like a dip belt and a like a barbell
or a dumbbell plate underneath it,

2140
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:22,790
that would probably
make my chin ups better.

2141
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:25,700
And what I probably get
to my ultimate goal,

2142
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:30,650
I want to be able to do 30 straight
arm chin ups, like all the way down.

2143
02:04:30,910 --> 02:04:33,200
Which one's a chin up?
Like this way it's my palms facing.

2144
02:04:33,230 --> 02:04:34,130
That's the way I always do it.

2145
02:04:34,131 --> 02:04:35,990
Cause I feel like that's
more applicable to Jujitsu.

2146
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:39,750
And you don't really choke anybody like
this. Yeah. You're doing a Geechee. Yeah,

2147
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:42,270
but I don't really like it chokes
when I used the geek, I don't,

2148
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:46,950
I don't use the gay. Like I, I use
a g for, I rolled with the gate.

2149
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:47,940
I have a black belt in the game,

2150
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:52,560
but my game is completely
defensive with Biggie.

2151
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:56,730
Like I um, I do the same
techniques over hooks, under hooks.

2152
02:04:57,030 --> 02:05:00,510
I do, you know, same type of Jujitsu.
I go for chokes and arm bars.

2153
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,730
I don't try to collar
choke people very rarely.

2154
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:06,120
I do the clock choke every now and in
the same one that believes you caught a

2155
02:05:06,121 --> 02:05:08,340
hoist with yes. Put them to
sleep with. That's a beautiful,

2156
02:05:08,690 --> 02:05:10,830
beautiful chat cause I
love the spin underneath.

2157
02:05:10,831 --> 02:05:14,130
It's such a Ninja move but if you
think about it like, you know,

2158
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:15,420
they'll say wise it's not,

2159
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:19,860
the grips is the hips and really top
practitioners in both gay and no gate.

2160
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,420
A lot of times the game is at virtually
the same solid for example or Shawn Gee

2161
02:05:23,421 --> 02:05:26,180
there the game is pretty much
the same whiskey without gay.

2162
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:28,350
They don't get overly dependent on grip.

2163
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:32,610
There's so many guys though that do
and we used to see that in the UFC.

2164
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:35,730
These guys who are one Dealz champion,
high level gay guys,

2165
02:05:35,731 --> 02:05:39,690
but they relied so much on spider guard,
so much on grabbing the sleeves.

2166
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:43,860
So much on the fucking shit is
gone when everybody's sweaty.

2167
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:45,990
When you got a sweaty guy in
his underwear on top of you,

2168
02:05:45,991 --> 02:05:48,990
drop an elbow on your face and
he happens to be a wrestler.

2169
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:52,020
So he knows how to grapple
and how to use this way,

2170
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:56,040
keep you thin down reaching for shit
that's not there. Instead of, you know,

2171
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:59,610
under hooks and you know,
overlooks and controlling your body.

2172
02:05:59,611 --> 02:06:02,340
Use the body and not the, the, the jacket.

2173
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:06,630
Well that's what Eddie Bravo always
emphasized that like so many of the

2174
02:06:06,631 --> 02:06:11,460
techniques of Jujitsu that these people
relied on and trained on a regular basis,

2175
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:14,670
they just weren't applicable.
You know, who's like,

2176
02:06:14,671 --> 02:06:18,890
do you see judo guys training
Greco Roman to get better at June?

2177
02:06:19,410 --> 02:06:20,630
You see the uh,

2178
02:06:20,631 --> 02:06:24,480
the you Sushi Miyaki the three time
world Greco Roman wrestling champion,

2179
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:29,810
his judo game and his Greco Roman
wrestling game were firstly identical.

2180
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:34,770
So he did both the same way as a sort of
the same. There's a huge under hook man.

2181
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:38,670
Uh, you did not want to get an a in
his life. Once he had that under hook.

2182
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:42,510
It wasn't a matter if you're going
to be thrown just a matter of when.

2183
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:45,030
And it was terrifying experience.

2184
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:49,350
I was on the receiving end
and the guy was like brutal.

2185
02:06:49,410 --> 02:06:52,860
Well when you see the guys that are like
really good at judo and they can apply

2186
02:06:52,861 --> 02:06:55,860
it to MMA, it's so beautiful.
Like Hector Lombard.

2187
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:58,080
Did you see Hector Lombard
versus Jake shields?

2188
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:02,160
That was quite a magnificent
match the way through him though.

2189
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:04,080
And who was that cringe
Weirdo guy and pride.

2190
02:07:04,081 --> 02:07:07,320
That was just toss and dude's the uh,
Korean judo guy.

2191
02:07:07,321 --> 02:07:09,630
Where's the guy that won
the gold medal from Korea?

2192
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:13,170
That was just a magnificent throws.
It was in one of the Japanese Yoshida.

2193
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,690
You're talking about your shopping list,
but he was a Japanese can I know,

2194
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:18,630
give a shit.
It was another Japanese show.

2195
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:23,550
I just remember watching it
and just watching this Jira
guy really cause Akiyama

2196
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:26,730
was it?
Akiyama was a judo guy.

2197
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:30,850
He was pretty high with Korean
gold medalists in the Olympics.

2198
02:07:31,190 --> 02:07:35,860
Think almost like half Korean and half,
half Japanese. I'm not sure. I never sent

2199
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,843
he really church.

2200
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:40,930
He took the judo and really turned it
into quite a fighting art without the gay.

2201
02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:43,520
It's really fun to watch.
I wish I could remember the show,

2202
02:07:43,521 --> 02:07:46,450
but I was hoping you'd remember.
Yeah. Um, well if you said his name,

2203
02:07:46,451 --> 02:07:50,140
I've paid you for this stuff, man. I
don't have any other sports in my head.

2204
02:07:51,850 --> 02:07:56,560
I have a Jujitsu, uh, kickboxing and MMA.

2205
02:07:56,561 --> 02:07:59,470
That's all I have in my head.
But you asked me some football questions.

2206
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:02,980
I'll stare at you bet. Let's go back to
strength training. Yes, please. Well,

2207
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:08,260
there there's a point of
diminishing returns where
getting stronger is not going

2208
02:08:08,261 --> 02:08:09,820
to improve your performance anymore.

2209
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:14,510
In order to get stronger
past a certain point,

2210
02:08:14,511 --> 02:08:16,520
you have to almost become
a strength specialist.

2211
02:08:16,521 --> 02:08:18,170
And this is where a lot
of guys get mixed up.

2212
02:08:18,630 --> 02:08:22,910
They start training like a power lifter
or Olympic weightlifter. Big Mistake.

2213
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:24,520
Okay?

2214
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,550
The majority of retailers should be
going into improving your skillset.

2215
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:32,230
That's the single most important thing
when it comes to endurance. Now, you know,

2216
02:08:32,231 --> 02:08:34,000
we talk about cardio and gas,
right?

2217
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:38,890
The absolute best way to get your cardio
and gas at a high level is to wrestle

2218
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:43,690
or to do MMA. The problem is a
lot of these guys are so good,

2219
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:47,770
they have no one to push their gas.
For example,

2220
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,580
I trained Shawn g barrow
the the year he won, uh,

2221
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:55,630
Abu Dhabi in Barcelona and he
took second in the open division.

2222
02:08:55,631 --> 02:08:57,670
He hurt his shoulder in the finals,
but he won his division.

2223
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:02,380
He was so good that there was no one
in the room to push it. Man. I mean,

2224
02:09:02,381 --> 02:09:06,610
this guy's like so good. So
elite to, I had, I had to,

2225
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:10,480
I had to, to, to pre exhaustion
before he would train.

2226
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:14,900
I put in through growing circuits
and such to rarely, you know,

2227
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:18,310
bring his cardio up and get him really
tired before he would roll before he

2228
02:09:18,311 --> 02:09:21,640
wrote. So, so that even an average
dude can give him a hard time.

2229
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,370
So now I have no juice left.

2230
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:27,580
I got to use short technique in
order to be ever to do what I do.

2231
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:31,780
That's fascinating. So that when
he could roll when he was fresh,

2232
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:36,220
it was probably a real treat. Oh yeah.
I mean it was this play. In fact, he,

2233
02:09:36,221 --> 02:09:38,860
I was actually in Oslo,
Norway at the time when he won,

2234
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:42,820
he texted me and it was one of the nicest
things anyone ever has. And he says,

2235
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:47,050
coach, I didn't even get tired
at all. And it was like, yes,

2236
02:09:47,051 --> 02:09:50,950
the strategy really, really worked well.
You come up with some brutal workouts,

2237
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:54,850
man, I still have those suspension
things that you gave me those, uh,

2238
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:59,260
but normally normally you wouldn't
need those type of brutal workouts.

2239
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:02,860
If you're getting high level
competition on the mat,

2240
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:06,080
it almost be would be too much.
It pushed you towards over training.

2241
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:09,940
That's interesting. So like a guy
like fate or like, or fuel door,

2242
02:10:09,941 --> 02:10:12,130
however you want to say it
and if you want to be correct,

2243
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:17,200
he and his at his best stopped all the
strength and conditioning training and

2244
02:10:17,201 --> 02:10:20,440
all he would do is fight
specific training. Pretty
much sports specific training,

2245
02:10:20,441 --> 02:10:22,600
which was always the Russian model.
Uh,

2246
02:10:22,601 --> 02:10:25,390
I do believe that you didn't need
to keep her absolute strength up.

2247
02:10:25,570 --> 02:10:29,320
You do need to lift weights a couple
of times a week just to keep, you know,

2248
02:10:29,350 --> 02:10:31,840
fairly heavyweight low wrap,
but don't tax yourself.

2249
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:36,350
Use it sort of as a tonic and then really
push yourself in the gym to get your

2250
02:10:36,351 --> 02:10:41,060
hard rolls onto, develop your
sports specific conditioning
because let's face it,

2251
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:42,260
all the rope skipping,

2252
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:47,350
running kettlebell swings stairs isn't
the same as getting on the map. Right?

2253
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:50,120
It's slightly different energy systems.
You're using muscles,

2254
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:53,120
different firing patterns and yes.
Okay.

2255
02:10:53,450 --> 02:10:56,960
If you don't have someone
to push you in the gym, yes,

2256
02:10:56,961 --> 02:10:58,880
this stuff is one way to do it,

2257
02:10:58,881 --> 02:11:03,170
but it's not the ideal way because
most MMA guys, let's face it, it's,

2258
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:06,920
it's like a full time profession
man. You're doing, you're wrestling,

2259
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:11,400
you're doing your kickboxing or boxing
or whatever you're doing, your Jujitsu.

2260
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:13,400
My God,
there's three disciplines.

2261
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:17,120
It's like the triad being in a
triathlon or triathlete, you know,

2262
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:19,340
you'll have to equally divide up.

2263
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:23,860
I found too that being when you
get injured and then come back,

2264
02:11:23,890 --> 02:11:27,940
it's always horrifying. Like the,
the Co, like if I, it would, uh,

2265
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:30,340
like tore my knee,
my knee meniscus,

2266
02:11:30,341 --> 02:11:33,670
I had it scoped and then I was out for
a couple months and then come back and

2267
02:11:33,671 --> 02:11:36,190
he's just like, oh, death, you know,

2268
02:11:36,191 --> 02:11:38,380
like a couple of minutes
and you're just a dead man.

2269
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:42,250
And one of the ways that I mitigated
that was kettlebell training.

2270
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:42,830
Well yeah,

2271
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:46,470
I mean when you're hurt or
you have injuries or you
don't have people to push to

2272
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:47,090
the gym,

2273
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:50,630
there are ways that you can very closely
simulates the energy systems that you

2274
02:11:50,631 --> 02:11:51,770
would use an actual grappling.

2275
02:11:51,950 --> 02:11:55,910
It's never as good as actual grappling
or kickboxing or whatever it really,

2276
02:11:56,090 --> 02:11:57,770
because you're forced to
react to the other person,

2277
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,340
which you're not when you're training.
So even when you're pushing hard,

2278
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:03,830
you're still pushing hard at your pace.

2279
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:08,750
You're not reacting to someone else's
pace and relaxing and breathing while you

2280
02:12:08,751 --> 02:12:11,360
were reacting to someone else's
cause that's the big one. Yeah.

2281
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:12,263
And the other thing,

2282
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:15,360
like I mentioned that wasn't real
big fan of like Olympic lifting.

2283
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:17,760
Olympic lifts are very technical,

2284
02:12:18,210 --> 02:12:22,350
very amazing athletic feat to basically
you're basically throwing a barbell over

2285
02:12:22,351 --> 02:12:24,630
your head and jumping
underneath it simultaneously.

2286
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:26,100
That's what Olympic lifting is.

2287
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:31,380
Very specific movement pattern has
nothing to do with martial arts. You know,

2288
02:12:31,381 --> 02:12:35,970
when's the last time you saw anyone lift
something over their head in martial

2289
02:12:35,971 --> 02:12:37,280
arts? Very rarely, you know,

2290
02:12:37,281 --> 02:12:39,960
as this tank Abbott trying to throw
somebody out of the cage and the skills

2291
02:12:39,961 --> 02:12:42,510
required to Olympic
lifter really high level.

2292
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:45,210
I mean these guys are amazing
athletes in their own right,

2293
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:50,400
but becoming an Olympic lifters not
going to make you better on the mat.

2294
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:53,260
It just isn't.
The Morse uh,

2295
02:12:53,610 --> 02:12:56,550
skill level at an exercise
takes the higher the skill,

2296
02:12:56,850 --> 02:12:58,620
the less care of her
value to anything else.

2297
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:01,260
That's why he went and keep your
workouts fairly general, fairly simple,

2298
02:13:01,261 --> 02:13:02,094
like your chin ups,

2299
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:07,280
fantastic care of her to any
martial art because it's fair.

2300
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:10,440
General is no skill.
You pull yourself up or you dump,

2301
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:13,620
you really develop a tremendous
amount of strength and in your case,

2302
02:13:13,621 --> 02:13:14,454
strength endurance.

2303
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:18,840
So dead lifts, squats, cleans.

2304
02:13:19,230 --> 02:13:22,070
Yeah. So why don't I got from
you is alternating cleans.

2305
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:25,590
I love that one with kettlebells.
Kettlebells. That's one of my favorites.

2306
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:29,260
Barbell clean and fan only because of
the way it can affect your back in a

2307
02:13:29,261 --> 02:13:33,210
really negative way. You mess up a
barbell clean, it can really screw your,

2308
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:34,620
your uh,
your lower back.

2309
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:38,550
Let's face it while we do on the mat is
dangerous enough in the ring and the Mat.

2310
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,260
It's pretty dangerous. Yeah. Alrighty.
So I don't need to make my workouts,

2311
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:47,040
you know, I don't need to include
traumatic type exercises like that. Right.

2312
02:13:47,150 --> 02:13:50,360
I only use barbells or uh, yeah, barbells.

2313
02:13:50,361 --> 02:13:54,650
I only use it for a bench press and
um, I try not to that too much. Um,

2314
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:57,620
but I will, if I don't have someone
there with me to help me spot,

2315
02:13:57,621 --> 02:14:00,560
cause it's hard to do
individual kettle bells with a,

2316
02:14:00,561 --> 02:14:02,510
with bench press or for dead lifts

2317
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:05,360
for deadlift and bench press it.
Yeah.

2318
02:14:05,361 --> 02:14:10,220
That's what a barbells for cannibis or
for swings pretty much get ups, you know,

2319
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:13,820
bodyweight training of course. Any
kind of pull up or a Chin up, uh,

2320
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:17,420
obviously depths and push ups and
things are fantastic, you know,

2321
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:19,460
right tool for the right thing there.
You know,

2322
02:14:19,461 --> 02:14:22,620
some people get really hung up and
kettlebells own way, but hey look,

2323
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:25,970
he's just one tool in the box,
man. They're good. But you know,

2324
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:26,790
there's plenty of other

2325
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:29,990
but it doesn't simulate chin-ups right
now. A lot of things that catalog,

2326
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:35,070
there's no uh, uh, vertical pulling
and uh, and kids about training.

2327
02:14:35,670 --> 02:14:40,410
So ideally you would do your general
strength training and then you get on the

2328
02:14:40,411 --> 02:14:44,180
mat and you get your conditionings need
met in the mat and the ring. So you would

2329
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:48,910
say that if someone was like a high
level Jujitsu guy and you were looking to

2330
02:14:48,911 --> 02:14:51,190
just maintain strength or get stronger,

2331
02:14:51,430 --> 02:14:55,180
you almost wouldn't do
conditioning with weights.

2332
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:58,990
You would almost do like heavyweights,
low res strength work,

2333
02:14:59,110 --> 02:15:04,110
low reps like you would take like maybe
like two 70 pound kettle bells and do

2334
02:15:04,571 --> 02:15:07,360
like alternate cleans. You
know, do some reps with

2335
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:11,720
heavy swam turkeys get
apps and some Chins,

2336
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:16,120
it'd be a 90 pound kettle bell with two
hands for swings. Exactly. Real heavy

2337
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:20,540
low rep work, you know, and not worry
so much about developing strength,

2338
02:15:20,541 --> 02:15:23,510
endurance or cardio with the weights.

2339
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:27,680
So you're just trying to get strong
with trying to get strong as you can for

2340
02:15:27,681 --> 02:15:29,720
your weight guys.
Now if you need to hypertrophy,

2341
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:32,300
you need to change the reps a little bit.
If you need to armor up,

2342
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:35,730
let's say I haven't worked in a guy that
might be planning NFL football and he

2343
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:38,510
needs to put on some muscle, it's going
to be a slightly different protocol.

2344
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:39,660
But we're,
you know,

2345
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:44,360
we're specifically talking to like MMA
and a weight class sports like Jujitsu

2346
02:15:44,361 --> 02:15:46,850
and siblings and I purchase
hypertrophied that's,

2347
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,000
I've always seen that
increase in muscular size.

2348
02:15:50,420 --> 02:15:52,970
There are some people that need
that and the way to get that,

2349
02:15:52,971 --> 02:15:57,960
it's just heavy low reps, right? Oh well,
no more moderate reps, moderate reps.

2350
02:15:57,961 --> 02:16:01,640
And the most important factor there is
what they call tall time under load.

2351
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:06,380
You need to have your muscles under
certain, uh, tension for a specific time.

2352
02:16:06,620 --> 02:16:10,650
That seems to be the most,
in fact, an important factor
to increase muscle. Right.

2353
02:16:10,670 --> 02:16:13,400
What do you, do you believe in
slow lifting? Do you know that, uh,

2354
02:16:13,401 --> 02:16:14,610
that style of lifting,

2355
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:17,680
especially for people that had been
injured like yourself and myself? Uh,

2356
02:16:17,681 --> 02:16:19,540
it can be a very good training tool.

2357
02:16:19,570 --> 02:16:23,920
I do a lot of slow rep work with myself
because I have had some trauma to my

2358
02:16:23,921 --> 02:16:27,250
shoulders and my neck and my back
over the years. You know, you don't,

2359
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,860
you don't do 43 years of sports without

2360
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:32,290
paying the price. Yeah. Last
time we worked out together,

2361
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:36,580
you were having some real shoulder
problems. Did that get better? I did not.

2362
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:41,050
It hasn't gotten worse. Wow. This is still
fucks with you. That's a, yeah. Well, I,

2363
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:44,890
I developed some osteoarthritis in the
shoulder mostly from just doing silly

2364
02:16:44,891 --> 02:16:48,790
stuff, you know? Can you just snatches,
look into this Regena keen stuff, man,

2365
02:16:48,791 --> 02:16:53,630
it's fantastic for that. Yeah. You really
should. It's, it's fantastic for that. Um,

2366
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:58,660
you're not a fan of, of a crossfit.
Not at all. Uh, for one thing,

2367
02:16:58,690 --> 02:17:01,880
there's not one elite athlete anywhere
in the world that actually uses crossfit

2368
02:17:01,890 --> 02:17:05,620
is the model. The second thing, the
second problem I have with crossfit,

2369
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:09,150
Greg Glassman, the guy that
invented it, it's, it's, it's,

2370
02:17:09,490 --> 02:17:13,480
it's this secret that he's very
fat or an obese cripple basically,

2371
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:14,560
who doesn't even train,

2372
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:20,250
what kind of system is it
when the inventor of the
system is not a good example

2373
02:17:20,471 --> 02:17:24,610
of what he's putting out there? It's
crazy, right? I don't know who the guy is.

2374
02:17:24,830 --> 02:17:29,800
Okay, well, can we see them pull
him up? Jamie? He, he, you know,

2375
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:32,650
the, uh, and of course then
the other thing is that's him.

2376
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:37,350
Get the fuck out of here. No Way. Would
you, now when you listened to him over,

2377
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:41,740
do you listen to me? I listen
to you anyway, but I mean,

2378
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:46,380
okay, listen, you don't need to look like
a men's health fitness bottle to be an,

2379
02:17:46,610 --> 02:17:50,470
you know, looking at feed or not. I mean,

2380
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:53,320
he looked like someone's dad, that
someone went into a bar and said, hey,

2381
02:17:53,321 --> 02:17:56,510
do you want a fight? And you know,
pulling them off the bar stool. And He,

2382
02:17:56,680 --> 02:18:01,680
I mean for sure if the best physique was
what determined who was going to win.

2383
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:05,380
Bodybuilders would win every fight,
but that just doesn't happen.

2384
02:18:05,381 --> 02:18:07,480
But for sure you want to be an example.

2385
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:10,630
You certainly don't want to be like
overweight and see if you can find some

2386
02:18:10,631 --> 02:18:14,140
other pictures of him. I mean, man caught
him on a bad day. Maybe he was bloated,

2387
02:18:14,141 --> 02:18:17,050
eat some,
eat some pastries on yourself.

2388
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:23,770
That's what the guy looks like.
That's fucking crazy ass. Why?

2389
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:26,110
Why? It has to tell you
some odd. That's really him.

2390
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:29,230
There was a major university
study on crossfit. Right,

2391
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:32,530
and for sure it improve
people's fitness levels.

2392
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,080
They got improved vo two Max,

2393
02:18:35,081 --> 02:18:38,650
which is the measure of your ability
to process oxygen. They got stronger,

2394
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:41,800
they lost body fat,
but when the study was looked at closely,

2395
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:47,130
20% of the people involved with the
crossfit dropped out due to injury.

2396
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:50,200
That means like if I'm a gym owner,

2397
02:18:50,350 --> 02:18:53,770
one out of every five of my clients is
getting hurt and I'm losing the client.

2398
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:55,960
That's insane, man. Wow.

2399
02:18:55,990 --> 02:19:00,990
One out of every five because proper
training for athletics is supposed to

2400
02:19:01,151 --> 02:19:03,850
prevent injuries,
not cause injuries.

2401
02:19:03,970 --> 02:19:08,590
If you're hurting yourself in the gym
with your supplementary training, do you?

2402
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:11,750
You got to go to a new model, man. Well,

2403
02:19:11,790 --> 02:19:15,460
who was that major crossfit guy
that just got paralyzed? Jamie,

2404
02:19:15,461 --> 02:19:18,070
pull that up if you can.
There's a guy who was in the crossfit,

2405
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:20,950
he was like the crossfit games and he was,
you know,

2406
02:19:20,951 --> 02:19:25,780
a major star of crossfit and I don't
know what exercises he was doing,

2407
02:19:25,781 --> 02:19:29,090
but he dropped the bar on himself or
something and broke his back. Airlines,

2408
02:19:29,110 --> 02:19:32,810
our stories all the time. Joe
[inaudible], who's a buddy of mine,

2409
02:19:32,811 --> 02:19:34,220
he jumped like someone shot him.

2410
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:38,150
Crossfit athletes was left paralyzed
after having a spine severed by a drop

2411
02:19:38,190 --> 02:19:41,210
barbell. Oh my God. So there once again,

2412
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:46,210
risk to benefit ratio of the exercises.
And so many of these guys, they're,

2413
02:19:46,211 --> 02:19:49,640
they're competing and extras that how the
hell do you compete an exercise? Well,

2414
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:53,330
I had a conversation with a guy who
was on, is that him right there?

2415
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:56,810
We dropped it on them.
Oh my God.

2416
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:01,020
Oh my God. It's falling
on its neck. Take it off.

2417
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:05,870
Oh my God. Pretty screwed up man.
Oh my God. It just fell on his,

2418
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:10,310
oh fuck. But think about this
for a minute. I said don't,

2419
02:20:10,311 --> 02:20:13,040
don't play the video. If I was
to say to you right now, hey,

2420
02:20:13,490 --> 02:20:17,450
let's do some push ups, we would use
good form and good technique, right?

2421
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:19,580
We'd really be working for,

2422
02:20:19,581 --> 02:20:23,720
the true purpose of exercise is to give
a stimulus to our muscles so we get

2423
02:20:23,721 --> 02:20:27,530
stronger, right? Body adapts,
right? But if I said, hey man,

2424
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:30,020
I bet you 20 bucks right now,
I can do more push ups than you.

2425
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:34,470
You think we'd be doing good
reps after awhile for me.

2426
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:36,980
Get rid of the window cause we
want to compete with each other.

2427
02:20:37,070 --> 02:20:40,490
That's the insanity of competing and
exercise and that's what crossfit does.

2428
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:44,780
So exercise really should
only be to benefit sport.

2429
02:20:44,781 --> 02:20:47,990
Like your initial impulse to get
into exercise in the first place.

2430
02:20:48,770 --> 02:20:52,460
I had a guy you to make you a better
athlete to increase your performance.

2431
02:20:52,700 --> 02:20:56,150
The crossfit people need to get the fuck
out of there and start getting out in

2432
02:20:56,151 --> 02:21:00,560
the mat and do some real competition
because let's face it, everything,

2433
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:04,910
every kind of sport is a sublimation
of man's desire to wage war.

2434
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:09,890
Why not really do war and Dumont? Dumont
in combat. That's what I'm talking about.

2435
02:21:09,891 --> 02:21:12,050
Steve Maxwell,
Eh,

2436
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:15,610
I had a kid on fear factor
once there was a crossfit, uh,

2437
02:21:15,650 --> 02:21:19,340
animal kid was in serious shape.
His girlfriend was a crossfit or two.

2438
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:23,180
They were both like fucking really
fit. And I was like, dude, what do you,

2439
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,370
what do you get out of it? And he's
like, you know, I just love competition.

2440
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,960
I just love pushing myself. And I'm
like, okay, have you ever done Jujitsu?

2441
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:32,120
You know, I tried to get them
to do it. I'm like, you would,

2442
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:33,890
you're a fucking animal.
You're stud. I mean,

2443
02:21:33,891 --> 02:21:36,590
do you know what an advantage would
be to be this fit? Like you just go,

2444
02:21:36,770 --> 02:21:40,340
you could go on the mats like you, like
you would right away. He will, your,

2445
02:21:40,341 --> 02:21:43,010
your conditioning is so high.
Your vo two Max is so high.

2446
02:21:43,011 --> 02:21:45,920
You would just have to learn
the techniques and you'd
be able to already just

2447
02:21:45,921 --> 02:21:47,600
outwork people.
But you know,

2448
02:21:47,601 --> 02:21:50,270
the shocking thing though is a
lot of times the work is very,

2449
02:21:50,271 --> 02:21:54,290
very specific to the particular
sport you'd take. For example,

2450
02:21:54,330 --> 02:21:58,310
well I'll usually answer Armstrong.
You know the greatest endurance athlete,

2451
02:21:58,311 --> 02:22:01,490
right? Is what he was coined. I mean,
let's take all the drug stuff out.

2452
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:05,450
They all used drugs. Okay. So yeah,
but he was the greatest psychos ever.

2453
02:22:05,451 --> 02:22:10,340
Amazing endurance. Right? His
first few 10 k runs, he suck, man.

2454
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:14,540
He sucked because he didn't have this
specific movement patterns of running

2455
02:22:14,710 --> 02:22:18,320
right now he got better, you know,
he had that type of energy system.

2456
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:22,670
But each sport is different. Right? You
take it a, you know, an average swimmer,

2457
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:26,040
he's even a really high level swimmer.
He's going to be exhausted

2458
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:29,880
in minutes on the mat. Yeah. But you
know, you take me and put me on a bike, I,

2459
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:32,030
you know,
I'm not going to have any interference on,

2460
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:35,790
on a mountain bike or a road
bike or whatever. You only,

2461
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:39,900
you only develop endurance and a
very specific way. So you know,

2462
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:42,630
the cross fit guys, believe me,
they would have to pay their dues.

2463
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:46,640
It would take them a long time to adapt
to Jiu Jitsu or wrestling because I can,

2464
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:50,160
I can remember being off the mat for a
long period of time and doing all these

2465
02:22:50,161 --> 02:22:52,860
heinous workouts with kettlebells
and bodyweight and all this.

2466
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:57,540
Go on the Mat and Oh my God,
I would suck air so bad.

2467
02:22:57,990 --> 02:23:01,320
My gas would be horrible. I'm
thinking, what the hell man,

2468
02:23:02,070 --> 02:23:05,150
you know I'm in shape.
What the fuck? Yeah.

2469
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:10,160
I was in shape to swing kettlebells and
to do burpees and it's not the same man.

2470
02:23:11,130 --> 02:23:15,900
Okay. It'd be better than if I hadn't done
those things at all. But let's face it,

2471
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:19,260
there's no substitute for
doing the actual activity.

2472
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:22,860
Especially if you're in there and you
have to roll with some savage who's in the

2473
02:23:22,861 --> 02:23:26,850
gym five days a week, training,
90 minutes a day, you know,

2474
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:30,270
doing yoga in the morning, you know,
just to clear enough for Jujitsu

2475
02:23:30,380 --> 02:23:32,360
and part and part of the skill of she did.

2476
02:23:32,361 --> 02:23:36,800
So of course is conserving your energy
while you make the other guy put all his

2477
02:23:36,801 --> 02:23:39,440
energy out.
So you got that factor going in there too.

2478
02:23:39,890 --> 02:23:44,890
I found myself shocked at how bad a
shape I was in when I was in good Jujitsu

2479
02:23:45,620 --> 02:23:49,340
shape and I started kickboxing again.
After a few years off,

2480
02:23:49,341 --> 02:23:51,740
I had done no striking at all.

2481
02:23:51,950 --> 02:23:54,950
I mean like occasionally I go out to
the garage and hit the bag a little bit,

2482
02:23:54,951 --> 02:23:59,360
but like just abandoned it because I was
really trying to get my black belt and

2483
02:23:59,361 --> 02:24:02,510
then I started kickboxing when I
was in really good Jujitsu shape.

2484
02:24:02,511 --> 02:24:07,511
I could roll hard for a long period of
time and I fucking hit the pads for a

2485
02:24:07,580 --> 02:24:11,800
minute and I'd be exhausted.
It's amazing how sports specific endurance

2486
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:15,140
body is specific adaptation
to imposed demand.

2487
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:19,820
You can't get good at something
else by doing a particular activity.

2488
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:23,990
You get good at that activity and the
body is amazingly specific when it comes

2489
02:24:23,991 --> 02:24:25,820
to that type of thing.
This is something I,

2490
02:24:25,821 --> 02:24:27,680
it took me awhile to kind of figure out,

2491
02:24:28,010 --> 02:24:32,600
so all of this crazy silly bugger of
waiving these battling ropes and so called

2492
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:36,390
Nma circuits, you know, it's
just, you know, MMA, you know,

2493
02:24:36,410 --> 02:24:37,970
man Gai.

2494
02:24:39,410 --> 02:24:42,230
But don't you think that that's
important though to build a base?

2495
02:24:42,231 --> 02:24:45,320
Like that's one of the things that Diego
Sanchez told me that he does when he

2496
02:24:45,321 --> 02:24:47,390
trains.
He said he would take,

2497
02:24:47,391 --> 02:24:50,870
like say if he had a fight coming up in
like four months and he would take the

2498
02:24:50,871 --> 02:24:55,700
first six weeks and just concentrate
entirely on strength and conditioning,

2499
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:58,880
just get himself very,
very, very fit and strong.

2500
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:00,750
You want to have the base,
you know,

2501
02:25:00,751 --> 02:25:04,680
having an aerobic base for anaerobic
sports is, you know, been proven.

2502
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:08,950
Having that type of, I remember even
in a wrestling season, you know, we,

2503
02:25:08,951 --> 02:25:13,610
we would do some, some uh, distance
runs, you know, couple miles, uh,

2504
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:16,480
doing general strength training
just to, you know, build our,

2505
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:19,020
our general strength up
to a pretty high level.

2506
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:22,380
And then as the season progressed,
we get more and more specific with our,

2507
02:25:22,381 --> 02:25:24,820
with our drills and our training.
And you know,

2508
02:25:24,821 --> 02:25:27,850
the shark bait drills and have
you ever played that dro? Uh,

2509
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,790
and Jujitsu first points,
everyone lines up against the wall.

2510
02:25:30,791 --> 02:25:32,920
You have your best three to
five guys out in the metal,

2511
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:36,970
first guy to get the two points
stays. Yeah Man, I'm telling you,

2512
02:25:36,971 --> 02:25:38,020
even not at high level,

2513
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:41,000
Blackbaud is going to get taken down
by a blue button at some point or get

2514
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:42,550
scored on cause he gets that time.

2515
02:25:42,770 --> 02:25:46,590
But I mean that's the type of strength
endurance I'm talking about for, for,

2516
02:25:46,591 --> 02:25:48,850
for grappling.
I mean there's a brutal drills man.

2517
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:52,690
Yeah. John's rock used to do one with,
with sweeps where he would uh, you,

2518
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:55,880
you'd be on the bottom and fresh guys
would be on top. It's just brutal.

2519
02:25:55,970 --> 02:25:58,910
And as long as you could sweep the guy,
you stayed in there, but if he swept you,

2520
02:25:58,911 --> 02:26:00,490
you got off set for endurance.

2521
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:04,480
No amount of, like I say,
supplementary training,

2522
02:26:04,510 --> 02:26:09,370
they can beat that. No way man. Just like
you found with the grappling, you know,

2523
02:26:09,371 --> 02:26:13,570
high level grappling conditioning, you
lost a lot of the endurance in the ring.

2524
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:18,580
Now imagine MMA fighter that has to have
high level endurance and take downs,

2525
02:26:18,910 --> 02:26:23,110
high level endurance it kicking and
punching Hailo Dorrance of Jujitsu and the

2526
02:26:23,111 --> 02:26:23,650
ground.

2527
02:26:23,650 --> 02:26:28,180
He doesn't have time to be the burning
his body up with all this other nonsense.

2528
02:26:28,390 --> 02:26:30,280
He's going to be absolutely,

2529
02:26:30,310 --> 02:26:33,670
utterly overtrained in no
time at all on burnout.

2530
02:26:33,850 --> 02:26:35,740
And of course a lot of
these kids do get burnout.

2531
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:41,220
Overtraining is really a pretty high and,
and,

2532
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:42,940
and combat sports.

2533
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:46,620
Yeah. How do they figure
out how they're overtrained?

2534
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:50,030
Is it monitoring resting heart rate,
your morning resting heart rate morning?

2535
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:54,680
Um, you take it first thing in bed when
you first wake up and you take it for let

2536
02:26:54,681 --> 02:26:57,620
seven days to get an out and that we're
assuming you're not already overtraining.

2537
02:26:57,860 --> 02:27:00,770
Right, right, right. Yeah. If
you suspect your overtrained,

2538
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:04,850
you might want to take a couple of days
off and then start this process of seven

2539
02:27:04,851 --> 02:27:09,590
days in a row, taking your monitoring
your pulse, uh, on, uh, uh,

2540
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:10,970
your iPhone.

2541
02:27:10,970 --> 02:27:15,260
There's an APP that you can actually hold
your finger on the camera lens and do

2542
02:27:15,261 --> 02:27:16,094
it.
It's pretty handy.

2543
02:27:16,730 --> 02:27:19,110
Instant heart, right? You hold
your finger on the camera lens,

2544
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:23,330
there's an app on your, how does a camera
lens figure out what your fight is?

2545
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:25,840
I don't know what the tech number,

2546
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:30,490
galaxy s five,
the new Galaxy Samsung.

2547
02:27:30,491 --> 02:27:33,900
And one of the things I like about it
that I was thinking about picking it up is

2548
02:27:33,901 --> 02:27:34,734
it has a,
uh,

2549
02:27:34,810 --> 02:27:38,820
a heart rate monitor built into the
actual phone itself because they have some

2550
02:27:38,821 --> 02:27:39,810
sort of fit app.

2551
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:43,440
It has something to do with the heat
coming up your finger is what I was toe

2552
02:27:43,740 --> 02:27:47,940
each pulse. It's a little bit of heat.
Yeah. Yeah. You see? Can you do it?

2553
02:27:47,941 --> 02:27:52,050
Do it right now. You have it on hand?
No, I uh, I'm embarrassed to say this,

2554
02:27:52,051 --> 02:27:55,090
but I was running here. Yeah. Uh,

2555
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:59,840
I actually had gone downtown
and I lost my iPhone as,

2556
02:27:59,841 --> 02:28:02,730
as jogging to the show.
Like it fell out of your pocket.

2557
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:05,760
I freaking fuck you can invest
in a fanny pack. Steve Maxwell.

2558
02:28:05,761 --> 02:28:10,260
I saw almost everyone. Okay,
man. I'm going to wear a
Joe Rogan. Vandy. Please do.

2559
02:28:10,261 --> 02:28:14,320
I would, it'd be honored.
Dammit. Leather roots iPhone.

2560
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:18,750
So it's a vein out there
on Santa Monica Boulevard,

2561
02:28:18,751 --> 02:28:23,690
somewhere on that little trail.
And I was due for an iPhone five anyways.

2562
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:27,800
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Do you know if they
have that? Find your phone app? Yeah,

2563
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:29,750
we were going to get
us if we could find it,

2564
02:28:29,751 --> 02:28:33,110
but some bum probably has it right now.
Some stinky bomb.

2565
02:28:33,190 --> 02:28:35,780
It was a lot of those in Santa
Monica, right? Oh Man. It's shocking.

2566
02:28:35,781 --> 02:28:39,500
How many bumps are on Santa Monica. Hey
Ben, look, if you gotta be homeless,

2567
02:28:39,501 --> 02:28:42,250
why not here man? It's a pretty
nice place to be homeless. Yeah,

2568
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:47,090
it's definitely a good spot.
Or beats a Toronto or Chicago.

2569
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:52,070
Fuck yeah. Siberia. Yeah. Yeah.
There's a brutal spots to be homeless.

2570
02:28:52,071 --> 02:28:56,840
So you hold your finger on the Lens.
You're doing it, Jamie. Is it working?

2571
02:28:56,900 --> 02:29:00,470
Yeah. And you can also monitor your
carotid artery. Your fucking heart rate.

2572
02:29:00,471 --> 02:29:03,600
62 beats per minute. That shit's
broken. Or your, let me see it.

2573
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:08,540
You are you are you? I read seven miles
yesterday. Did you really fucking animal.

2574
02:29:08,541 --> 02:29:12,890
Look at you savage, dude. My
normal resting heart rate is 59.

2575
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:16,970
Now remember I'm Kinda rushing rate is
when you first wake up in the morning

2576
02:29:16,971 --> 02:29:18,680
before you even get out of bed.
How do I start at?

2577
02:29:18,681 --> 02:29:22,310
Jamie was probably button on the bottom.
It might restart. There you go. Okay.

2578
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:24,770
Let's see. And you put it over
the camera. Okay, here we go.

2579
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:29,390
And then you just had amazing, yeah,
they technologies pretty crazy.

2580
02:29:29,430 --> 02:29:33,720
I'm going to try to, I'm not a tech
guy, but what's it called Jamie?

2581
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:37,970
It's a bunch of incident heart right out.

2582
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:41,960
And then it would record your
message and it'll keep, uh,

2583
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:45,140
you will be able to,
well that's pretty fucking the record.

2584
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:49,430
So once you know what the average
is, right, take for seven, divide,

2585
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:54,560
that's, oh, it has options. Just
woke up before bed, exercising.

2586
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:58,820
That's incredible that he
can figure it out from you.

2587
02:29:58,821 --> 02:30:02,630
Holding your finger over a camera.
What a world we live in. Well,

2588
02:30:02,631 --> 02:30:05,030
I don't want old world and amazing.

2589
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:07,790
And you're talking to a guy that went
and used a cell phone or a laptop,

2590
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:09,830
like for years.
When I first met you,

2591
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:14,190
you had one of those blackberries
with the push button with the ski.

2592
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,820
We would click, click, click. I
had one of those pieces of shit.

2593
02:30:16,821 --> 02:30:20,420
You remember that and you were like, this
is amazing. I can do everything on this.

2594
02:30:21,590 --> 02:30:23,090
You were so fired up about it.

2595
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:28,450
So resting heart rate and then if your
morning resting pulse rate when you first

2596
02:30:28,851 --> 02:30:33,290
wake up is more than six or more beats,
you should not train that day.

2597
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:37,130
That means if you have an elevated
heart rate, your stress Dude,

2598
02:30:37,310 --> 02:30:39,740
you have not recovered from
the previous day. Stress.

2599
02:30:40,270 --> 02:30:43,130
Elevated heart rate is
the first sign of stress.

2600
02:30:43,190 --> 02:30:46,970
So it's all that nonsense about pushing
yourself. You don't want to get up,

2601
02:30:46,971 --> 02:30:50,400
you got to get up anyway, push
through it. You feel like Shit, oh,

2602
02:30:50,401 --> 02:30:51,051
I push through it.

2603
02:30:51,051 --> 02:30:53,570
There's days where I just didn't
want to train but I forced myself to.

2604
02:30:53,850 --> 02:30:56,450
You really shouldn't do that. You
should not. That's fascinating.

2605
02:30:56,451 --> 02:30:57,830
So that's a real lesson for people.

2606
02:30:57,831 --> 02:31:01,070
So there's a lot of folks out here
that think is a lot of folks in him.

2607
02:31:01,071 --> 02:31:05,090
And to think like there's days when your
beat and exhausted and you got to push

2608
02:31:05,091 --> 02:31:07,450
through. You shouldn't push through,
you should not push through it.

2609
02:31:07,451 --> 02:31:08,810
You're doing damage to your body.

2610
02:31:08,811 --> 02:31:11,870
You're pushing yourself further and
further into exhaustion at something.

2611
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:15,770
And now that doesn't mean that you
can't get up and do joint mobility,

2612
02:31:16,070 --> 02:31:20,670
stretching, Yin Yoga,
walking with the breath work.

2613
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:24,750
Uh, you can go in and if you can hold
yourself back on of these kids are pretty

2614
02:31:24,751 --> 02:31:29,340
addicted to training, but you could also
do skill rehearsal. You could do drill,

2615
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:30,211
you know,

2616
02:31:30,211 --> 02:31:33,460
if you're a do something that doesn't
push you and say you're a competitive Jiu

2617
02:31:33,460 --> 02:31:37,290
Jitsu guy, so you practice your favorite
sweep or you're bearing bolo or your,

2618
02:31:37,291 --> 02:31:41,640
your turtle guard, whatever. You do
that and you don't do anything hard.

2619
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:45,060
Does your son Zack follow
all your principals? So all,

2620
02:31:45,061 --> 02:31:48,570
he's been a really good model of like
this type of intelligent training.

2621
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:52,730
And he does not do supplementary training
other than strength training and lifts

2622
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:54,090
weights and just,
yeah.

2623
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:57,230
And he does this all monitoring
the heart rate and all that jazz.

2624
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:01,230
That's fascinating. He's done really
well from savvy one brown belt worlds.

2625
02:32:01,231 --> 02:32:03,540
And uh, he's one of the few
guys actually built Kron Gracie.

2626
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:08,040
He'd be crying to the Las Vegas black
bout. Uh, a challenge. No, look,

2627
02:32:08,041 --> 02:32:12,280
I was very impressed with Zach. Um, you
know, I knew who he was because of you,

2628
02:32:12,281 --> 02:32:13,140
you know,
you told me about him,

2629
02:32:13,141 --> 02:32:16,440
but then Eddie Bravo actually
told me about him and I said,

2630
02:32:16,441 --> 02:32:19,740
did you know that that's Steve Maxwell
son? He was like, holy, Whoa, no wonder,

2631
02:32:20,010 --> 02:32:21,660
you know, he was like, no
wonder it gives him a kid.

2632
02:32:21,661 --> 02:32:26,460
Must be a fucking animal growing up. Steve
Maxwell, he's an animal. He's an animal.

2633
02:32:26,461 --> 02:32:31,050
So if a guy wakes up, like say if your
normal resting heart rate is, you know,

2634
02:32:31,051 --> 02:32:32,130
for any leaf athletes,

2635
02:32:32,131 --> 02:32:35,970
let's say it's 40 beats a minute and
you wake up in one day, it's 45. Yeah.

2636
02:32:35,971 --> 02:32:36,441
You probably,

2637
02:32:36,441 --> 02:32:41,441
you definitely should take off that day
or stretch or just something like they

2638
02:32:41,641 --> 02:32:46,560
call it active recovery. Yes. Where it's
just one of moderate low level activity,

2639
02:32:46,860 --> 02:32:50,190
but definitely don't go beat
your brains out in the gym. Wow.

2640
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:53,460
And so the people that do do that, that
thank you. Just gotta push through.

2641
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:57,210
They're just being strong,
but being dumb.

2642
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:00,090
They're being dumb because
there's going to work against e,

2643
02:33:00,690 --> 02:33:03,060
let's put it this way.
It's not what you can do in the gym.

2644
02:33:03,061 --> 02:33:06,080
It's what can you recover from it to gym.
Wow.

2645
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:09,050
Cause all the magic happens from
rest. And Man, let's, let's,

2646
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:13,920
I work out only has negative consequences.
You're blood pressure's elevated,

2647
02:33:14,110 --> 02:33:17,010
your must, Julie Weaker.
You've, you know, you've,

2648
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:20,760
you've actually torn and broken
down muscle fiber, you know,

2649
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:23,820
your whole hormonal system is lower.

2650
02:33:24,510 --> 02:33:29,220
It's that rest phase in between the
workouts where your body adapts and you

2651
02:33:29,221 --> 02:33:32,040
become stronger.
The more fit you become,

2652
02:33:32,041 --> 02:33:35,220
the longer it takes to recover because
you're able to push yourself harder and

2653
02:33:35,221 --> 02:33:37,410
harder.
A weak person that's not very fit.

2654
02:33:37,590 --> 02:33:39,840
They can't push themselves
hard enough to really, they,

2655
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:44,430
they actually could probably work out
every day but a really fit strong guy like

2656
02:33:44,431 --> 02:33:45,300
yourself.
For example,

2657
02:33:45,301 --> 02:33:49,470
you can not drive yourself every day
cause each workout you're making sets a

2658
02:33:49,471 --> 02:33:50,670
demand on your body.

2659
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:54,330
One thing that you cannot control
is your ability to recover.

2660
02:33:54,331 --> 02:33:58,860
It's set at the biologic
level. It's cellular man.
Unless you're doing steroids,

2661
02:33:59,090 --> 02:34:04,010
unless you join sterile, that changes
a lot. But even those guys still, uh,

2662
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:08,100
they re one of the things that steroids
does do is it allows you to recover much,

2663
02:34:08,101 --> 02:34:08,970
much more quickly.

2664
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:12,390
I wanted to talk to you about weight
cutting too because there was a really

2665
02:34:12,391 --> 02:34:16,330
fascinating thing today. There was
an article in bloody elbow about uh,

2666
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:18,130
Jim Miller and Jim Miller

2667
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:22,360
was talking about how he believes at
weight cutting took years off of his life.

2668
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:26,950
And you know, I mean Jim looks fantastic
this weekend. He beat a Yancey Madeiros.

2669
02:34:26,951 --> 02:34:29,230
He is submitted them to get
tea and put them out. Actually,

2670
02:34:29,350 --> 02:34:32,290
first time I ever seen the guys celebrate
while I guys unconscious lying on him

2671
02:34:32,620 --> 02:34:37,540
like Jim is like this. And the guys
aren't completely out cold eyes open,

2672
02:34:37,660 --> 02:34:40,260
lying on top. And Yancey is a
fucking stud too. So it was,

2673
02:34:40,261 --> 02:34:43,180
it was a big victory for him.
Miller's a sick Jujitsu guy.

2674
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:47,430
He submitted a Fabrizio coins in his
last fight who was one of 'em, uh,

2675
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:48,670
one of boilers,
black belts.

2676
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:53,320
So I caught him with a really slick
armbar this guy gotta be pretty dog gone

2677
02:34:53,321 --> 02:34:54,830
good.
Jim Miller is a bad motherfucker,

2678
02:34:54,850 --> 02:34:58,060
but he was talking about his
weight trop and uh, you know,

2679
02:34:58,061 --> 02:35:02,980
his weight cut that he's, you know, made
a lot of errors over the years and that,

2680
02:35:02,981 --> 02:35:06,340
uh, he, you know, he's fucked it up. But
you know, this is a direct quote. He says,

2681
02:35:06,341 --> 02:35:10,510
I'm positive.
I took years off my life cutting weight.

2682
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:11,980
That's fucking crazy.

2683
02:35:12,270 --> 02:35:16,380
Well, have you think about it? Just
combat sports in itself. Like I said,

2684
02:35:16,430 --> 02:35:19,710
we had mentioned this several times
is no one ever said it's healthy.

2685
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:23,460
It definitely shaved years off then
into your life. But, hey, look, man,

2686
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:25,410
you can't just have,
I mean,

2687
02:35:25,411 --> 02:35:28,590
you could just be like some dude that
never did much and just sits around and

2688
02:35:28,591 --> 02:35:32,240
has a really nice long life. But
I mean, what the hell that man,

2689
02:35:33,170 --> 02:35:36,420
it's like, man, can't
just sit around. Right?

2690
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:40,470
So like you take the typical
NFL football player, you know,

2691
02:35:40,471 --> 02:35:43,020
the average life expectancy
for an NFL football player,

2692
02:35:43,021 --> 02:35:47,130
I believe it was 64 years old. It's not
very old. It's Pr, you know, that's,

2693
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:50,130
that's young dude. There's only three
more year years older than I am.

2694
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:54,300
But if you were to ask those guys, hey,
was it all worth it? They'd say, hell or,

2695
02:35:54,301 --> 02:35:59,050
yeah, man, the roar of the crowd,
the adulation. You know, uh,

2696
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:03,780
you know, the excitement of playing
at such a high, elite level of sport,

2697
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:07,050
almost every guy too, man
would say, yeah, you know what,

2698
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:11,730
I would take the shorter life for
the glory. But that aside, you know,

2699
02:36:11,731 --> 02:36:16,530
people that are just doing this for
fun as a hobby, they gotta be careful,

2700
02:36:16,531 --> 02:36:18,810
man.
They can't be doing all this crazy stuff.

2701
02:36:18,811 --> 02:36:21,180
You know these kids that go to the
local tournament's and this and that.

2702
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:24,210
They're playing around with us
all this series weight cutting,

2703
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:28,080
they're doing their, their health,
irreparable harm. Fight your damn,

2704
02:36:28,081 --> 02:36:32,850
wait and stop trying to get an unfair
advantage by cutting down and then gaining

2705
02:36:32,851 --> 02:36:33,230
back.

2706
02:36:33,230 --> 02:36:34,220
We'll look at some of the greats.

2707
02:36:34,221 --> 02:36:38,930
Look at Frankie Edgar constantly fought
guys much larger than I'm one the title

2708
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,690
beat Bj Penn,
who also did the same thing.

2709
02:36:41,870 --> 02:36:45,470
Bj Penn fought below his
weight for his entire career,

2710
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:48,890
fought fucking heavy weight
when he fought Leo Machida,

2711
02:36:49,070 --> 02:36:52,070
but Cheetah was like two oh eight when
they fought. It was pretty amazing.

2712
02:36:52,071 --> 02:36:55,340
Fucking crazy and held his
own. How does that, you know,

2713
02:36:55,341 --> 02:36:59,750
beat Matt Hughes who was a
monster at one 70 you know,

2714
02:36:59,751 --> 02:37:04,751
Bj Penn was the perfect example of a
guy who just fought anybody at any way.

2715
02:37:05,390 --> 02:37:06,410
The guy had no fear of man.

2716
02:37:06,470 --> 02:37:11,270
It's an animal and now he's fighting
at one 45 I know. It's incredible.

2717
02:37:11,271 --> 02:37:13,460
I mean, it's probably where he
should have been his entire career.

2718
02:37:13,610 --> 02:37:16,100
If you compare the athletes
today and what they're doing, but

2719
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:19,520
even at one 45 he just
decided to alter his diet,

2720
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:23,630
put it really intensified as training
and now he got down to like he's walking

2721
02:37:23,631 --> 02:37:27,170
around a little over 150 pounds so
he's not going to cut a lot of weight.

2722
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:31,310
You know these guys that are
cutting like 25 30 pounds away.

2723
02:37:31,550 --> 02:37:36,050
I've seen guys shuffle up to the
scale like like death warmed over.

2724
02:37:36,390 --> 02:37:38,630
Travis Luter was the worst cadavers man,

2725
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:42,950
Travis Luter when you fought Anderson
Silva miss the weight cut and a missed it,

2726
02:37:42,951 --> 02:37:44,150
tried it again,
missed it again,

2727
02:37:44,151 --> 02:37:47,570
and then wound up fighting for a non
title fight because he couldn't make the

2728
02:37:47,571 --> 02:37:50,120
weight and he was off by not much.

2729
02:37:50,121 --> 02:37:53,900
At the end it was only like a pound and
a half, but shuffling to the weight,

2730
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:54,351
to the,

2731
02:37:54,351 --> 02:37:57,860
to the scale because he couldn't walk
and then they tried to rehydrate with

2732
02:37:57,861 --> 02:38:01,190
these ivs. Yeah, they take the ivy man.

2733
02:38:01,191 --> 02:38:05,030
There's no way that your body could
sustain that type of abuse and you'd be at

2734
02:38:05,031 --> 02:38:06,770
your best.
You're not going to be at your best.

2735
02:38:06,940 --> 02:38:10,370
The idea is though that you're going
to be theirs. Luder um, when he,

2736
02:38:10,371 --> 02:38:14,180
when he weighed in, it's hard to tell
from the photos how bad he looked.

2737
02:38:14,181 --> 02:38:18,110
He had to see him moving and walking.
Look how sunk in his eyes were though.

2738
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:20,710
And he, um, I mean it's,

2739
02:38:20,730 --> 02:38:25,730
it's hard to tell from that picture how
much different he looks than he does

2740
02:38:26,150 --> 02:38:28,910
when he's normal and healthy
and full and ready to rock.

2741
02:38:29,180 --> 02:38:34,010
That was a guy that fucking massive
potential. He was such a good Jujitsu guy,

2742
02:38:34,011 --> 02:38:39,011
but until end of his career and
personal experience like a 1974,

2743
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:44,660
I was gearing up for the uh, uh, uh,
and say, uh, double a tournament.

2744
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:46,700
You know, we're getting into
the big tournament season.

2745
02:38:47,180 --> 02:38:49,010
I had a record of 18 children.

2746
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:53,300
One at that time was really good
college wrestler I high level and uh,

2747
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:57,590
somehow I got talked into going down
at one 58. I was doing great at one 67.

2748
02:38:57,591 --> 02:39:00,890
That was like my natural way. I
felt really good. I was strong.

2749
02:39:01,310 --> 02:39:06,020
Joe is a huge mistake. I ended up getting
the flu. I get sick. I felt like shit.

2750
02:39:06,021 --> 02:39:08,150
So you're probably already
lean at that way already.

2751
02:39:08,151 --> 02:39:09,650
Lane and you were cutting what?

2752
02:39:09,651 --> 02:39:14,651
How much did you drop out from one
67 to one 58 that's almost 10 pounds.

2753
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:18,790
But what were you weighing when you
weighed one 67 what we walking around,

2754
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:23,880
I usually about one 70 maybe we
only cut a little bit cause I,

2755
02:39:24,141 --> 02:39:26,450
I was a very strict even in those days,

2756
02:39:26,451 --> 02:39:29,570
even in my college days back in the
70s it was very strict about my diet.

2757
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:33,740
There's a lot of people that are trying
to figure out the point of diminishing

2758
02:39:33,741 --> 02:39:36,110
returns. Like what is it when
it comes to weight cutting,

2759
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:41,120
because you'll see guys that rehydrate
and they are beasts like glace and t bow.

2760
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:43,640
That guy cuts almost 30 fucking pounds.

2761
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:47,360
Well one of the things I really liked
about the moon jobs and the Pan ams,

2762
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:52,640
you weigh in at the edge of the mat and
then you go out and you fight right then

2763
02:39:52,641 --> 02:39:55,250
and there. There's no cheating.
The scales can't do that.

2764
02:39:55,251 --> 02:39:58,250
For the UFC though I often wished they
would though because I'll tell you,

2765
02:39:58,251 --> 02:40:01,520
you would see, see the, the,
the abuse of weight loss,

2766
02:40:01,521 --> 02:40:04,820
but completely had to fight their own way.

2767
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:06,560
I think that they should
fight their own weight.

2768
02:40:06,561 --> 02:40:11,561
And I think that's more in line with the
spirit of martial arts because why are

2769
02:40:11,961 --> 02:40:13,980
people losing weight while
they're trying to have

2770
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,090
a mechanical advantage? Tall rangy
guys have that leverage strength, uh,

2771
02:40:18,091 --> 02:40:20,140
leverage advantage. I mean, you know,

2772
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:23,700
strength advantage and then you know,

2773
02:40:23,701 --> 02:40:27,780
you'll lose this weight unnaturally
artificially and then, you know,

2774
02:40:27,781 --> 02:40:30,630
by fight time you're much,
much heavier.

2775
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:34,530
It's kind of a form of cheating actually,
in my opinion.

2776
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:37,320
In a way it is in a way it is,
but if everybody's doing it,

2777
02:40:37,321 --> 02:40:40,530
it almost is a necessity to compete at
the highest levels. That's the problem.

2778
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:43,420
Well that is the problem. It's
just like the guys, you know,

2779
02:40:43,421 --> 02:40:46,480
like Lance Armstrong's look,
every body was taking the drugs.

2780
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:51,250
How can you compete at that level in
the Tour de France if you don't? Well,

2781
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:56,180
okay, but my point is no
one should be Jordan. Okay,

2782
02:40:56,290 --> 02:40:59,620
well the Lance Armstrong thing, the
problem was that he's a douchebag. Wow.

2783
02:40:59,650 --> 02:41:02,980
That's the problem. Sued everybody
for saying that he was taking drugs,

2784
02:41:03,310 --> 02:41:08,260
said everybody you know, look people in
the eye and said, you know, I never doped.

2785
02:41:08,261 --> 02:41:12,200
I never denied tasing my iron man. Not
Amazing. I didn't believe him. Nah,

2786
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:17,140
not for a fucking second. Not For one
second. I had a friend, uh, my friend, uh,

2787
02:41:17,170 --> 02:41:21,190
is a, uh, former professional cyclist
and he told me, he just, he goes,

2788
02:41:21,191 --> 02:41:25,600
listen to me man. No one, no one's
clean. I go, no one. He goes,

2789
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:29,560
no one's going. I could believe
that. He said, guys would get up.

2790
02:41:29,590 --> 02:41:32,890
He was on the tour and guys would
get up and they were, you know,

2791
02:41:32,950 --> 02:41:34,930
there were on a bus together,
guys would get up.

2792
02:41:34,931 --> 02:41:38,140
They would be on so much EPO that they
would have to take their bike out in the

2793
02:41:38,141 --> 02:41:41,230
middle of the night and run, cause their
blood would start getting sick. Oh Jesus.

2794
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:44,110
Yeah. Oh Jesus. That's crazy stuff man.

2795
02:41:44,230 --> 02:41:47,260
He said you would hear the guy get their
bike rack off and you would hear them

2796
02:41:47,261 --> 02:41:50,480
just ride off and you knew exactly what
it was. Just trying to thin out of that.

2797
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:52,840
You know,
I think we see it in fighters.

2798
02:41:52,990 --> 02:41:56,200
There's some fires at workout the day
before the fight. And why are they,

2799
02:41:56,201 --> 02:42:00,460
why we know why they do it. They have
to, they probably have to, you know,

2800
02:42:00,461 --> 02:42:03,070
why would you want to stress your
body out the day before a fight?

2801
02:42:03,220 --> 02:42:06,190
I mean it's one thing to get a light
workout and I don't switch it up.

2802
02:42:06,540 --> 02:42:08,530
Jumping rubbed some stretching,
a little yoga.

2803
02:42:08,590 --> 02:42:11,320
This guys who would work out
hard the day before and it also,

2804
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:15,220
EPO wasn't even being tested in
Nevada until, I mean, I don't know.

2805
02:42:15,250 --> 02:42:16,750
I think they're testing for it now,

2806
02:42:16,930 --> 02:42:20,470
but for the longest time they weren't
testing for EPO because they thought it

2807
02:42:20,471 --> 02:42:22,690
was an endurance sport.
A problem,

2808
02:42:22,691 --> 02:42:25,720
like a thing like cycling and triathlons
and they didn't think that applied to

2809
02:42:25,721 --> 02:42:29,160
boxing, which I thought was like
one of the best pieces of evidence.

2810
02:42:29,161 --> 02:42:33,400
You've got fucking morons who are
dictating what gets tested and not tested.

2811
02:42:33,401 --> 02:42:34,450
Like you want to talk.

2812
02:42:34,780 --> 02:42:37,930
Just a complete ignorance of
what is involved in the sport.

2813
02:42:38,140 --> 02:42:40,510
Boxing is such an intensive adorne sport.

2814
02:42:40,670 --> 02:42:44,000
Amazing. And Jordan sport man, anywhere
in the dad. It just get in there,

2815
02:42:44,020 --> 02:42:48,620
do three minutes sometime in a boxing
gym and see the bag. It's absolutely,

2816
02:42:48,680 --> 02:42:50,750
utterly devastating if
you're not used to it.

2817
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:53,600
Yeah. Jimmy, without anybody
ripping your body with left heart,

2818
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:58,220
let alone taking the punches [inaudible]
addition and trying to breathe while

2819
02:42:58,221 --> 02:42:59,560
someone's punching you breathing.

2820
02:42:59,660 --> 02:43:02,360
Well that's the thing that Nick Diaz
always does to guys. People who say, well,

2821
02:43:02,361 --> 02:43:03,380
why does he punch like that?

2822
02:43:03,381 --> 02:43:06,230
Because like he'll throw it like a lot
of punches that aren't even that because

2823
02:43:06,231 --> 02:43:08,630
you can't breathe when he's hitting you
while he's hitting you, you're going,

2824
02:43:08,930 --> 02:43:09,763
you're tightening up.

2825
02:43:09,890 --> 02:43:13,690
So a few minutes that like
you've essentially held
your breath while he's just

2826
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:17,990
rob had pop pop of, of
oxygen. Yeah. But uh,

2827
02:43:18,210 --> 02:43:20,290
one thing I was really
happy about the Moon Zhao,

2828
02:43:20,350 --> 02:43:24,460
they've finally started testing the
metal winners for the drugs for years.

2829
02:43:24,461 --> 02:43:27,100
They did not.
And when did they do this?

2830
02:43:27,710 --> 02:43:30,160
Is this has just been
the last couple of years.

2831
02:43:30,530 --> 02:43:33,440
That's very important because for
the longest time guys would come out,

2832
02:43:33,441 --> 02:43:34,310
look in purple,

2833
02:43:34,970 --> 02:43:38,540
they were bright. 70 guys are bragging
about the drugs that they were taking.

2834
02:43:38,690 --> 02:43:42,800
And finally they made it illegal.
They are now testing the,

2835
02:43:42,801 --> 02:43:46,490
the place winners in the Mungia
and you're suspended. Now,

2836
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:50,630
I believe Zach told me this the other
night that, uh, I believe it's a year.

2837
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:53,620
I don't know whether that's true or not.
I heard it's a year of suspension.

2838
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:55,740
So no Jujitsu tournaments
would offer a year.

2839
02:43:56,590 --> 02:43:58,690
I think you should be
more like three years. But

2840
02:43:59,090 --> 02:44:01,460
well, that would really
make it real. You know,

2841
02:44:01,910 --> 02:44:04,700
the UFC does nine months for
the first offense, you know,

2842
02:44:04,701 --> 02:44:08,870
but they're really trying to crack down on
it. And now, you know, we have this, uh,

2843
02:44:08,871 --> 02:44:12,920
the TRT issue,
which I had Dr. Mark Gordon,

2844
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:16,850
who is an expert in traumatic brain
injury who was talking to me about the,

2845
02:44:16,910 --> 02:44:20,230
you know, he's like, there's two reasons
why someone needs testosterone. Well,

2846
02:44:20,231 --> 02:44:24,800
this three, one year an older person
and your body starts to wane to,

2847
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:28,130
you've suffered brain injuries,
three,

2848
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:31,730
you took steroids and then you depleted
your system and now you have to

2849
02:44:31,731 --> 02:44:36,080
replenish it artificially. And so
finally they remove that from fighting,

2850
02:44:36,081 --> 02:44:38,960
which I think is very
important to have those things.

2851
02:44:38,961 --> 02:44:42,440
So traumatic brain injury for sure.
And then the steroid taking for sure.

2852
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:44,330
And then if you're old,
you're, you're, you know,

2853
02:44:44,331 --> 02:44:47,690
you're a guy and he's in his forties
and you, you want to keep competing in.

2854
02:44:47,691 --> 02:44:51,320
The only way to do it with
is with testosterone. Boy,

2855
02:44:51,321 --> 02:44:53,300
you probably shouldn't be
fighting anymore, probably. No.

2856
02:44:53,420 --> 02:44:55,370
I mean it's a certain point
and it's a young man's game

2857
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:58,130
and you can do things naturally,
uh,

2858
02:44:58,190 --> 02:45:02,240
to stimulate it as you get like my age.
Yeah. We're running out of time here.

2859
02:45:02,241 --> 02:45:07,030
Sorry. But, uh, yeah, just doing high
intensity interval training. Watts. Yeah.

2860
02:45:07,070 --> 02:45:11,800
Uh, ha. Uh, full body movement
patterns. Uh, big, big movements. Uh,

2861
02:45:11,810 --> 02:45:15,830
I like to run some sprints, wind sprints,
those type of things. You know, Short,

2862
02:45:15,831 --> 02:45:18,980
intense, uh, can really
stimulate the body to,

2863
02:45:19,020 --> 02:45:22,770
what do you think? If you studied
at all any of these new, uh,

2864
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:27,060
this new gains that they're making in
genetic engineering and what they're

2865
02:45:27,061 --> 02:45:30,600
pushing for,
have you contemplated what this,

2866
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:33,090
what the possibilities are for sports?

2867
02:45:33,091 --> 02:45:37,170
Because it's one of the things that
I'm more, I want to say concerned,

2868
02:45:37,171 --> 02:45:39,660
but fascinated at the
same time, you know, as a,

2869
02:45:39,661 --> 02:45:42,690
as a person who's standing outside of it,
I mean obviously I'm a commentator,

2870
02:45:42,691 --> 02:45:47,691
but science is so close to altering the,

2871
02:45:47,971 --> 02:45:52,380
the very genetics of a human being.
I mean, within our lifetime, 40,

2872
02:45:52,381 --> 02:45:57,300
50 years from now, Max, you're going
to see super athletes from the bottle,

2873
02:45:57,480 --> 02:46:01,110
you know, from the, from a test tube,
from a needle, from whatever it is,

2874
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:03,000
genetic engineering,
keep

2875
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,250
threatening. Anyway, it's going to happen.

2876
02:46:05,850 --> 02:46:09,980
I'm sure maybe at some point it's
still seems to be pretty off and

2877
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:13,190
still a lot of theory and conjecture.
So, but what happens then? I mean,

2878
02:46:13,310 --> 02:46:15,620
how much do we lose if
we think about what,

2879
02:46:15,621 --> 02:46:19,610
what an athlete is when you admire
a guy like say a rocky Marciano,

2880
02:46:19,611 --> 02:46:22,580
a great boxer, or, or, uh, you know,

2881
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:26,690
any great athlete from a time
where they weren't doing anything,

2882
02:46:26,870 --> 02:46:29,930
what do you admire them for?
You admire them for their willpower,

2883
02:46:29,931 --> 02:46:34,760
their determination, their, their focus,
their tenacity, the fact that this guy,

2884
02:46:35,110 --> 02:46:39,860
they're there, their workmanship, the
work ethic. Work Ethic. When I was a kid,

2885
02:46:39,861 --> 02:46:40,880
when I lived in Boston,

2886
02:46:41,150 --> 02:46:45,910
Mohammed Ali was gonna
Fight Mustapha Hampshire and
Muhammad Ali was one of them.

2887
02:46:45,911 --> 02:46:49,940
Will Spartan training, excuse me, not
Muhammad Ali. Jesus Christ. Marvin Hagler.

2888
02:46:49,970 --> 02:46:51,770
Well, I was going to fight.
We'll stop at Hampshire.

2889
02:46:51,771 --> 02:46:53,840
I can't put this in Muhammad Ali because
I was thinking about him as another

2890
02:46:53,960 --> 02:46:58,960
example of a great athlete who just
trained hard and an Arrow with no drugs.

2891
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:03,950
But Marvin Hagler was going to fight
Mustapha Ham show and he was training for

2892
02:47:03,951 --> 02:47:07,070
it and Cape Cod in the winter.
And one of the reasons why I did those,

2893
02:47:07,071 --> 02:47:10,720
cause he would run the sand dunes and
just because he loved the fact that he's

2894
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:15,050
in the fucking brutal cold of the
Cape cod running by the ocean.

2895
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:19,930
And I remember they had a thing on the
news where they were hyping up the fight

2896
02:47:19,931 --> 02:47:23,600
and they're going through his training
regime and he was running up sand dunes,

2897
02:47:23,601 --> 02:47:28,300
screaming war, screaming, just whoa.

2898
02:47:28,340 --> 02:47:32,870
And just running and shadow boxing. And
I saw that and I went running, I ran,

2899
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:34,410
I ran stairs near my house.
There was,

2900
02:47:34,411 --> 02:47:37,130
this is stairs near this bridge near my
house. And I went running. I was like,

2901
02:47:37,131 --> 02:47:39,860
fuck. But you know, he's instead,

2902
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:42,710
he's sitting there and they're pumping
them full of EPO and they're monitoring

2903
02:47:42,711 --> 02:47:44,180
his blood and you know,

2904
02:47:44,390 --> 02:47:49,170
giving them artificial this and
genetic that and what, what,

2905
02:47:49,171 --> 02:47:50,180
what is a Bot?
I mean,

2906
02:47:50,181 --> 02:47:55,181
remember Drago in Russia and the fucking
in the rocky for when he saw Stallone

2907
02:47:55,941 --> 02:47:59,720
was fucking running with logs in his
back to the snow and they have Drago,

2908
02:47:59,721 --> 02:48:03,250
they're spiking them with steroids. And
I left in a cart full of rocks, you know?

2909
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:08,720
Well, you know we've already done
to our food with genetic modified.

2910
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:13,820
It's inevitable though. Like
I, but they're going to do
it to the human body also.

2911
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:16,760
I meant who knows? But what does
that have to say about athletics?

2912
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:19,520
What does athletics going to
be when that happens? Well,

2913
02:48:19,521 --> 02:48:23,680
it sure isn't going to be what we knew
it to be and it's sure not as sure strays

2914
02:48:23,690 --> 02:48:26,930
far from the,
the idea that carrot is for 2000 years,

2915
02:48:26,940 --> 02:48:28,580
which was the ancient Greek ideal.

2916
02:48:29,250 --> 02:48:33,200
Our generation degrees or generations
would probably the last generations to

2917
02:48:33,201 --> 02:48:37,120
know what privacy feels like. Like
real true privacy. You know when,

2918
02:48:37,230 --> 02:48:38,690
when when you were a kid
you could leave the house,

2919
02:48:38,691 --> 02:48:41,330
you could just fuck off and go anywhere
and nobody had any idea where you are.

2920
02:48:41,480 --> 02:48:44,660
Your parents hoped he came home and that's
about it. That's pretty much it, man.

2921
02:48:44,661 --> 02:48:47,480
My mom sent me out with a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich and a brown bag,

2922
02:48:47,481 --> 02:48:49,730
say see it dinner and that was it.

2923
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:54,170
I remember we got an answering machine,
make it,

2924
02:48:54,180 --> 02:48:58,430
somebody could leave a message when you
weren't home making tree forts and all

2925
02:48:58,431 --> 02:49:03,020
sorts of crazy stuff. The, the era
of genetic manipulation though,

2926
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:06,500
surely like right around the corner,
we're within our lifetime within 40,

2927
02:49:06,501 --> 02:49:08,130
50 years.
So

2928
02:49:08,210 --> 02:49:10,250
I don't know,
but uh,

2929
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:15,180
probably when it goes into full swing and
becomes completely accepted by society,

2930
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:18,630
I guess I'll probably be dead
by that point. So I dunno dude,

2931
02:49:18,631 --> 02:49:20,130
I have a feeling you're
gonna live a long time.

2932
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:21,750
I have a feeling you're going
to be around for a long time.

2933
02:49:21,800 --> 02:49:25,770
You kind of plan it for it to,
your diet is very unusual in that respect.

2934
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:30,420
Has Gotten very spartan and the systematic
underrating has shown to be one of

2935
02:49:30,421 --> 02:49:31,440
the keys to longevity

2936
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:35,010
systematic under eating.
How many cows do you mark your calories?

2937
02:49:35,110 --> 02:49:38,570
Uh, I, I use an Okinawan, you know,

2938
02:49:38,590 --> 02:49:41,820
Okinawa or like one of the, uh, that,

2939
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:45,850
that blue zone where people like an
unusual amount of lift to be centenarians.

2940
02:49:46,390 --> 02:49:47,260
Very high level.

2941
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:51,010
There's another blue zone is Ikaria
Greece where there's an unusual amount of

2942
02:49:51,011 --> 02:49:54,260
people that live to be over a hundred
years old. Part of it's genetics,

2943
02:49:54,270 --> 02:49:57,130
but a lot of it is the lifestyle.
It's the lack of stress and so forth.

2944
02:49:57,430 --> 02:49:59,980
But any rate the Okinawans
have to sing. Uh, 80%.

2945
02:50:00,310 --> 02:50:04,570
You never leave the table
feeling satisfied. You
never eat until you're full.

2946
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:09,790
You leave 80% capacity. So I, okay.

2947
02:50:09,950 --> 02:50:12,230
Why did they do that? What's,
what's the philosophy behind that?

2948
02:50:12,340 --> 02:50:16,300
The idea is if you overburden
judge digestion by over
eating or making yourself

2949
02:50:16,301 --> 02:50:19,510
feel full, it's too much of
an innovation on the system.

2950
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:22,450
It takes more out of you than
what you get out of your food.

2951
02:50:22,530 --> 02:50:24,240
So that has been something that they,

2952
02:50:24,241 --> 02:50:27,180
it's ingrained in their culture for a long
time. It's ingrained in their culture.

2953
02:50:27,540 --> 02:50:29,520
Wow. So this is something they
figured out a long time ago.

2954
02:50:29,550 --> 02:50:33,510
They figured this out a long time ago.
It goes way back to ancient times.

2955
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:36,140
They also get a lot of coral
calcium too, right? Isn't that like

2956
02:50:36,490 --> 02:50:37,840
part of the, do they, you know,

2957
02:50:37,870 --> 02:50:42,370
they have a lot of mineralization from
their fish broth and so forth and they

2958
02:50:42,371 --> 02:50:47,140
eat a very, very, a simple
pretty spartan diet. Really.

2959
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:48,280
I mean,
it's very simple.

2960
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:52,550
Now in these days, how much time
we're going to lift Jimmy? Five,

2961
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:56,620
five minutes these days. Um, do you
roll it all anymore? Do you still,

2962
02:50:57,210 --> 02:50:59,540
I was just down in Arcadia, uh, uh,

2963
02:50:59,570 --> 02:51:02,390
roller round at Carson Gracie school.

2964
02:51:02,660 --> 02:51:07,540
Now do you make sure that
you don't go with any crises?
Don't go on. Let me, well,

2965
02:51:07,550 --> 02:51:08,383
you know,
I'm a busy dude,

2966
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:11,930
fifth degree Blackbaud now and a lot
of times I am a little bit younger than

2967
02:51:11,931 --> 02:51:15,560
what I look,
so kids don't see a 61 year old dude.

2968
02:51:15,610 --> 02:51:18,520
They see like, oh, I'm good right now.

2969
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:22,900
So I gotta be very careful who I choose.
I would like to do a light roles.

2970
02:51:22,930 --> 02:51:25,080
Usually the instructor of the
school's pretty good. Yeah.

2971
02:51:25,180 --> 02:51:27,910
You know, and he'd go in with a lot
of the melody, you know, for sure.

2972
02:51:28,060 --> 02:51:31,660
Get permission before you go to these
schools. You just don't show up.

2973
02:51:31,690 --> 02:51:33,600
And put the guy in the
spot. Right, right, right.

2974
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:36,790
They might think you're challenging or
something and they want to show off in

2975
02:51:36,791 --> 02:51:39,070
front of the students or whatever.
So I'm very, very careful.

2976
02:51:39,490 --> 02:51:41,710
I like to roll with a guide.
Your guys.

2977
02:51:42,070 --> 02:51:44,020
I try not to roll with a
really heavy guys anymore.

2978
02:51:44,090 --> 02:51:47,990
Yeah, I'm done with heavy guys. It's
just so bad for your back. Yeah, no,

2979
02:51:47,991 --> 02:51:51,860
it is it back. It just any guy
over 200 pounds stacking you.

2980
02:51:52,420 --> 02:51:56,280
It's just too much on your, your joints
and your especially your spine. Like,

2981
02:51:56,650 --> 02:51:59,180
like here on Gracie. Apparently
I want to talk to him about this,

2982
02:51:59,181 --> 02:52:01,070
but he's got a numb arm.
Yes.

2983
02:52:01,160 --> 02:52:03,570
I,
I do an awful lot of joint mobility work.

2984
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:08,500
I actually teach a specific anti aging
mobility routine DVD on it. Yeah.

2985
02:52:08,690 --> 02:52:13,060
Uh, a video downloads. Actually I,
I've switched from DVDs to downloads.

2986
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:17,530
I have the DVD. I'm old school.
Yeah. There you bought it
years ago. But, uh, yeah,

2987
02:52:17,531 --> 02:52:20,350
mobility is really important, but I've
changed my boat belty over the years.

2988
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:24,160
Now I've learned new things and have
incorporated new ideas so I should get the

2989
02:52:24,161 --> 02:52:27,160
new one. Yeah, I think so. I'll send
it to you. Where do I get it from?

2990
02:52:27,380 --> 02:52:31,150
If somebody was listening to this,
it's Steve, Matt, it's Maxwell,

2991
02:52:31,151 --> 02:52:36,151
sc.com maximal strength and conditioning
SC Maxwell as well as c.com.com.

2992
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:40,720
The website. That's everything.
And um, I'll send you the link.

2993
02:52:40,721 --> 02:52:43,810
You just write me and I'll send
you the links. And your, um,

2994
02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:48,440
your Twitter though is Steve Maxwell,
sc two. Steve Maxwell. I see. Um,

2995
02:52:48,490 --> 02:52:53,290
so if someone wants to get a strength
and conditioning program from you,

2996
02:52:53,291 --> 02:52:57,010
you do all that stuff online, right? I
do. And you have a lot of videos online.

2997
02:52:57,011 --> 02:52:59,690
There's a lot of cool stuff that
videos and stuff. I'm walking,

2998
02:52:59,691 --> 02:53:04,120
I'm always trying to, you know, uh,
improve myself. I'm still a student.

2999
02:53:04,450 --> 02:53:06,290
I don't care how long you've
been in the game, man.

3000
02:53:06,291 --> 02:53:10,090
He could still learn new things.
And so it's an ever evolving thing.

3001
02:53:10,091 --> 02:53:13,000
And of course as they get older,
I have to change up too. I mean,

3002
02:53:13,330 --> 02:53:17,020
no one gets out of here alive.
Everyone, you know, your,

3003
02:53:17,021 --> 02:53:19,900
your capacity does diminish
over time and you feel the bump,

3004
02:53:19,901 --> 02:53:24,820
but you can really slow it down to a
crawl. As long as you continue to push,

3005
02:53:24,850 --> 02:53:26,950
you got to do some push.

3006
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:31,010
You got to constantly give fight
against the aging process. Um,

3007
02:53:31,150 --> 02:53:34,760
you were also a god, we're running out
of time here. I wish we weren't. Um,

3008
02:53:34,810 --> 02:53:36,430
you were in Russia recently.

3009
02:53:36,460 --> 02:53:41,460
I was doing some Novosibirsk went
there on your own dime just too darn.

3010
02:53:41,980 --> 02:53:46,980
I was working with a conditional cough
who was the father of a Russian military

3011
02:53:46,991 --> 02:53:50,470
martial arts. It was pretty interesting.
This guy is like 80 years old,

3012
02:53:50,630 --> 02:53:52,740
kind of like you Nelia Gracie kind of guy,
man.

3013
02:53:52,741 --> 02:53:57,040
He put me in the most painful wrist
lock. This guy was, he was saying,

3014
02:53:57,070 --> 02:54:01,480
do something to me in Russian and uh,
getting the translation, I'm thinking,

3015
02:54:01,481 --> 02:54:04,690
Oh shit, what do I gotta
do this Old Nan? And Wow,

3016
02:54:04,990 --> 02:54:09,490
that guy is really a main, very
soft, relaxed, uh, martial art.

3017
02:54:09,790 --> 02:54:13,960
He was the creator of this particular
Russian military martial art. And it's a,

3018
02:54:13,961 --> 02:54:17,710
it's all geared towards military
and self defense. What does it have?

3019
02:54:17,711 --> 02:54:21,340
Its roots in a Slavic martial arts.
That was earlier.

3020
02:54:21,770 --> 02:54:26,270
There was a guy by the nearer spirit,
enough that a study Chinese and, and uh,

3021
02:54:26,500 --> 02:54:29,350
different internal systems. And then, uh,

3022
02:54:29,410 --> 02:54:32,560
he taught it to Kadesh nick coffee and
then conditional cough and mixed it with

3023
02:54:32,561 --> 02:54:37,250
some slot native Slavic type
martial arts. And it, it's uh,

3024
02:54:37,330 --> 02:54:41,980
he also created the biomechanical
exercises for the body mobility drills for

3025
02:54:41,981 --> 02:54:46,750
health and wellbeing. Uh, good for
any sportsman wrestlers, Jujitsu guys.

3026
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:49,630
So I'm teaching a lot of this stuff now.
I've incorporated into my own,

3027
02:54:49,870 --> 02:54:53,340
my own system. Fascinating. So when
you go and meet with the garlic,

3028
02:54:53,350 --> 02:54:56,220
that and learn and stuff, are you
videotaping, answering? No, not enough.

3029
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:58,240
Your types of loud. So how did you, uh,

3030
02:54:58,241 --> 02:55:01,570
you just remembered what he said
and then I have a real good memory.

3031
02:55:01,610 --> 02:55:05,780
Took notes on my iPhone and so forth.
The one I have lost. Thank God.

3032
02:55:06,350 --> 02:55:10,550
Thank God for iclicker. Ah, they'd
go, you backed it up. Um, so you, you,

3033
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:12,860
it's systemic. Is that what it is? Yeah,

3034
02:55:12,890 --> 02:55:16,040
it's called systemic and there's
a couple of branches to systemic.

3035
02:55:16,041 --> 02:55:17,330
This is the original system.

3036
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:21,260
There's the group up in Toronto that
does their version, the Michael Ratko,

3037
02:55:21,560 --> 02:55:25,000
that's like the phantom punches.
And that's what I've seen a lot.

3038
02:55:25,220 --> 02:55:29,750
A lot of that is rad goes punched his
guys and he hurts when he punches.

3039
02:55:29,751 --> 02:55:32,690
It really hurts.
And what he does is he'll,

3040
02:55:32,750 --> 02:55:37,190
he'll show the fist and the guys just
fall down because they don't want to get

3041
02:55:37,191 --> 02:55:41,720
hurt. So he really is controlling them
psychically, just by intimidating him.

3042
02:55:41,960 --> 02:55:45,320
So he's just a hard puncher that's got
a bunch of pussy whipped students pretty

3043
02:55:45,710 --> 02:55:49,430
much. But their students are pretty
tough guys. But there's something to it.

3044
02:55:49,820 --> 02:55:51,530
It's the breath work.
You know,

3045
02:55:51,540 --> 02:55:56,000
Hixon came out of retirement and a is
doing the seminar circuit blackbelt friend

3046
02:55:56,001 --> 02:55:59,810
of mine in Germany, Bjorn Friedrich, he
was the first German blackbelt and Bjj.

3047
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:03,730
He took Hixon seminar and he says, wow,
he spent the first hour just a breath,

3048
02:56:03,731 --> 02:56:06,640
work and relaxation.
And that's what the systemic guys,

3049
02:56:06,641 --> 02:56:09,260
Joe will crone was talking about
that on the podcast as well.

3050
02:56:09,290 --> 02:56:12,380
It's funny cause the Gracies all
did it but they never taught us.

3051
02:56:12,510 --> 02:56:16,910
But now the revealing the secret and
it really does go back to the breath.

3052
02:56:16,950 --> 02:56:20,570
I would love to be, this could be a
whole podcast in itself. Just breath,

3053
02:56:20,600 --> 02:56:22,730
just the breathwork.
Well when he back in la again,

3054
02:56:22,820 --> 02:56:25,130
well it may be sooner than later.

3055
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:28,430
I'm thinking about doing another video
downloaded at some of the stuff I learned

3056
02:56:28,431 --> 02:56:32,180
in Russia and I'm going to do three foot
long workouts that guys can do in their

3057
02:56:32,181 --> 02:56:36,380
hotel room or while they're on the
road, uh, anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

3058
02:56:36,830 --> 02:56:40,160
And I'm going to actually do a full on
workout and I love this videographer out

3059
02:56:40,161 --> 02:56:44,870
here. I shot a, a a trailer
for a possible reality TV show.

3060
02:56:45,470 --> 02:56:48,650
And uh, that's what I was doing
here in La, the plus a book deal.

3061
02:56:48,680 --> 02:56:52,520
I had an article in the march issue of
men's health and it attracted a lot of

3062
02:56:52,521 --> 02:56:53,300
attention.

3063
02:56:53,300 --> 02:56:58,300
So I had an offer to come out and shoot
a trailer maybe to pitch some people

3064
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:03,410
cause I am a pretty weird dude man. Yeah,
you're pretty weird dude. A bag, you know,

3065
02:57:03,411 --> 02:57:04,550
I don't have a key.

3066
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:08,030
I don't have no kids cause I don't
have any locks to need him for.

3067
02:57:08,031 --> 02:57:09,440
I don't know why.
Apartment or a house.

3068
02:57:09,441 --> 02:57:12,260
And that doesn't ever freak
you out sometimes, you know,

3069
02:57:12,680 --> 02:57:15,110
being a former householder and yeah.
You know,

3070
02:57:15,111 --> 02:57:18,530
having a gym and a house and cars
and everything could go back to that.

3071
02:57:18,531 --> 02:57:21,600
Is this temporary hailed a, once
you leave all that stuff, it's,

3072
02:57:21,601 --> 02:57:25,610
it's suffering man. Wow. It's like
real freedom. You're an inspiration.
