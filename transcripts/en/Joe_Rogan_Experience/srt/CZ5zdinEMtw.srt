1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:03,811
So,

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:04,470
um,

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,220
so I got an injected and that was um,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,720
first of all looked like it got like run
over by a semi truck for like two days.

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,630
It was like all black and blue
or the injection you serve was,

7
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:16,464
yeah,

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,850
yeah,

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,010
yeah.

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,850
I'd be super nervous.

11
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,530
Like what do you got infected it,

12
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:20,730
it could have gotten infected

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,310
that cancer.

14
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,640
I've had Marissa and I would
not wish Murcia on your Dick.

15
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,400
I didn't get mercy a triathlon.

16
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,310
I,

17
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,110
I got it.

18
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,270
This was at though at
the wildflower triathlon,

19
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,081
like coming back,

20
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,200
my flight got delayed and I was
covering all these kids like an off road

21
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,350
triathlon and I had all these
scrapes and wounds and I think,

22
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,330
I think my labor was in Vegas,

23
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,351
I don't remember where,

24
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,300
but I had to check into a hotel.

25
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,850
Flight got delayed and I slept in this
hotel room that I swear like there must

26
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,270
have been something on the bed because
within a few days like it was all,

27
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,540
you know,

28
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,850
it gets all nasty and cakey
and then it was eating a whole,

29
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,780
I wrote a whole blog post about
this on my website and they see,

30
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,120
you can see pull up the
hole in the back of my leg.

31
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,953
It's nasty.

32
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,941
Scares the shit out of him.

33
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:05,250
Just just search for like Ben Greenfield
staff and you'll see the pictures.

34
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:08,010
But it was eating a whole in
the back of my leg and my,

35
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,090
my kids role now,

36
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:10,170
once a week and I buy,

37
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,041
I get the,

38
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,790
the defense soap from on it.

39
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,620
As soon as they come,

40
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,210
as soon as they come back in the door,

41
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:18,480
I have them go into the shower
upstairs and defense and writes down.

42
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:18,871
Yeah.

43
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,140
They have a bunch of different wipes and
stuff for people that train in a place

44
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,670
that doesn't have a a shower.

45
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,391
Yeah.

46
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,440
You gotta be careful.

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,520
Uh,

48
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,930
thieves essential oil.

49
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,710
Like it's like going to like a whole
bunch of companies make this version of

50
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,970
essential oil called thieves.

51
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:37,050
It's like clove and roads named after
these thieves who apparently never got

52
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:37,884
clove.

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,930
Cinnamon Eucalyptus,

54
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:41,480
which is really good
for staff and Rosemay.

55
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,301
It's actually named it.

56
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,960
There's like this story of like these
four thieves that apparently traveled

57
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:49,020
around the world and they
would rob Holmes and,

58
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,710
and,

59
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,840
and they never got sick.

60
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,580
Like that's basically the story.

61
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,560
I'm sure this was,

62
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:56,520
this was some board table at a,

63
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,740
at a multilevel marketing
essential oils company.

64
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,230
Somebody came up with this
story or it could be true.

65
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,651
I don't know.

66
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,240
But the um,

67
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,571
yeah,

68
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:03,781
the,

69
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:06,600
the stem cells into the Dick
that that was an interesting one,

70
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,500
but it did.

71
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,023
Um,

72
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,250
I think from what I can tell,

73
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,150
looking in the mirror,

74
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,073
it got bigger.

75
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,670
I'm pretty sure how much,

76
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,810
so half inch,

77
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:15,961
oh.

78
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:20,850
Like maybe that much like enough to
tell and my erections got bigger and my

79
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,000
orgasms got a lot better for how
long they are still like that.

80
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,571
Well,

81
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,640
people don't take what they
have right in front of them.

82
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,510
Seriously enough.

83
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,010
It's like the wasting time thing.

84
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,270
They don't do the arithmetic,

85
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:30,901
you know,

86
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,490
when they also don't understand,

87
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,070
they devalue what they have
right in front of them.

88
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,113
Like another,

89
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,390
another client I worked with was having
a hard time putting his kid to bed at

90
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,200
night.

91
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,910
And so we did the arithmetic.

92
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,181
It's like,

93
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:46,230
well I'm fighting with my
kid for 45 minutes a night
trying to get them to go to

94
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:46,890
bed.

95
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,131
Okay,

96
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:47,461
so let,

97
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:48,420
let's analyze that.

98
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,691
All right,

99
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:49,524
so what does that mean?

100
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,221
Well,

101
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,650
it means that both of
you end the day upset.

102
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,560
That's not so good cause
why would you want that?

103
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,290
It means that you're spending 45
minutes fighting when you could spend 20

104
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,220
minutes doing something

105
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,701
positive.

106
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:04,840
Like reading to them say means that you
don't get to spend that time with your

107
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,171
wife.

108
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,490
So she's not very happy with you.

109
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,200
Plus you're annoyed
because you don't see her.

110
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,520
Plus do you blame it on the kid?

111
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,080
Because he's the proximal cause.

112
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,610
It's like that's pretty damn ugly.

113
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,480
And then,

114
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,860
and then let's do the arithmetic.

115
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,750
It's like seven days a week,

116
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,800
45 minutes a day.

117
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,240
Let's call that five hours,

118
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,680
20 hours a week,

119
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,810
240 hours in a year.

120
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,590
It's six.

121
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,860
You're spending a month and a half of
work weeks fighting with your four year

122
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:27,440
old son.

123
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,300
I think you're going to like them.

124
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,101
You don't like anyone.

125
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,560
You spend a month and a
half a year fighting with.

126
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,850
It's a bad idea.

127
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,043
Fix it.

128
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,423
It's important.

129
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,840
Get them to bed,

130
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,710
make it peaceful.

131
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,650
You do it like these things
that repeat every single day.

132
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:46,350
That's a Motif in this book to your
life isn't Marguerite is on a beach in

133
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,960
Jamaica that happens now in
that those are exceptions.

134
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,260
You're life is how your wife greets you
at the door when you come home every day

135
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,090
cause that's like 10 minutes a day.

136
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Your life is how you treat each other
over the breakfast table cause that's an

137
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,960
hour and a half or an
hour every single day.

138
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,570
You get those mundane things right?

139
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,950
Those things you do every day,

140
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,200
you've concentrated on them
and you make them pristine.

141
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,900
It's like you got 80% of
your life put together.

142
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,540
These little things that
are right in front of us.

143
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,860
They're not little.

144
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,610
That's the first thing.

145
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,320
They are not little and
they're hard to set.

146
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:20,561
Right.

147
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,371
And if you set them right,

148
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:25,240
it has a rippling effect and fast
to way faster than people think.

149
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,493
But

150
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,700
people were sending me messages,

151
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,260
blood's on your hands and this.

152
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:29,651
Now I'm like,

153
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:34,000
if you went out and had unprotected
Buzzcocks after listening to the Joe Rogan

154
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:34,834
experience,

155
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,790
you deserve what's coming.

156
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,210
Yeah.

157
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,541
Okay.

158
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,070
If you listen to me and you're like,

159
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:39,904
that's it,

160
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,730
Peter Duesberg,

161
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,090
right.

162
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,923
Send it in.

163
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,611
Rex spot is go.

164
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm odd man.

165
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,940
You can't demonize conversations.

166
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:51,520
And I don't know enough about the subject,

167
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:54,670
but I listened to that guy's take on it.

168
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,900
And it's fuel for thought.

169
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,171
You know,

170
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,070
I don't think he's right.

171
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,940
I don't,

172
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,510
but I,

173
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,190
I've talked to a lot of
people that I don't figure,

174
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,431
right.

175
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:05,380
I think I've talked to some crazy fucking
people on the show and I think you

176
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,690
gotta be able to have conversations.

177
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,500
You have to,

178
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,681
well,

179
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,140
I mean we might agree on 60% of things,

180
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:11,681
maybe 50,

181
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,120
maybe get somewhere between 40 and 70.

182
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:13,930
I don't know.

183
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,560
It doesn't matter.

184
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,393
It should be okay.

185
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,480
But it should be totally fine.

186
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,501
And that's the thing when we do,

187
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:17,860
uh,

188
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,071
you know,

189
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:19,030
the change my mind segments,

190
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,110
most time people,

191
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,720
it's pretty amicable and then you just
get someone who comes up and wants to

192
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,490
commit assault the trickling puffs.

193
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,180
And it's like,

194
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,200
I think a big skill,

195
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,960
we've kind of had to learn
this because not Jared knows.

196
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,873
Um,

197
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,910
when we first had guests,

198
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:31,271
if it was,

199
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,390
if it was a guest we just agreed with,

200
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:33,641
I was like,

201
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,150
listen,

202
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,260
I will not edit you.

203
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,000
It will not be taken out of context.

204
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,660
But I would sit down for three hours
with them because they would be like,

205
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,171
don't cut me off.

206
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:41,561
Don't come up.

207
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,820
And you realize it just
repeating themselves.

208
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,630
So finding the balance of saying there
are a lot of people out there now who are

209
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,510
open to hearing these points of you
who are open to hearing these ideas.

210
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,080
Being able to identify them and then
being able to identify the people who are

211
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,070
so bought in,

212
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,060
they won't even listen.

213
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,910
You need to make an example of them
for the people you can convince.

214
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,361
Right.

215
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,310
And understanding the two
different kinds of people,

216
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:01,501
the,

217
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:01,901
the trigger,

218
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,170
the puffs versus uh,

219
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:03,771
you know,

220
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:04,071
I don't know,

221
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:04,671
Jordan Peterson.

222
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:08,240
You'll probably never saw himself as even
political at all until he came out and

223
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,660
said something that would seem to
be so benign and caused an uproar.

224
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,500
Um,

225
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,940
I think being able to identify those two,

226
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,620
it's not so much just
about left and right.

227
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:19,010
Who can hear who won't
and how to handle them.

228
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,461
Right.

229
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,150
And why,

230
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,050
why can't you hear?

231
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:25,520
Can you not hear because it interferes
with your ideology or can you not hear?

232
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,660
Because what they're saying is illogical.

233
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,790
Like which one is it?

234
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,480
Is it,

235
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,850
are you honestly listening
to what they're saying?

236
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,390
And can you give factual refute?

237
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,790
Can you give some sort of
a factual review of this?

238
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,624
Or is it just,

239
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,430
it just doesn't jive with your
view of the world you have.

240
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,970
You have some rock solid view
of the world that you're not,

241
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,150
uh,

242
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,940
you're not willing to look
at any other perspectives.

243
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,910
So I had that big of a decision because
the colorful kids didn't get no pussy.

244
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,090
They just wanted to post.

245
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,210
They would talk about girls and they may
be had a crush on the girl and the four

246
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:58,050
30 class,

247
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,740
but then the rest of the company,

248
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,593
any of the events,

249
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,741
my other buddies,

250
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:02,574
one the buzzy.

251
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,060
So eventually I cut the karate fucking
geeks out and I started hanging out with

252
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,090
a little druggies.

253
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,190
And you make your transition
from those developmental ages.

254
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,890
Like I tried to hide my drug use.

255
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:17,724
I tried to hide,

256
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,120
especially with marijuana
use for two or three years.

257
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:22,160
It was just marijuana.

258
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,320
While then,

259
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:29,820
once I became a freshman and got it
and start basketball my freshman year,

260
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,440
I decided to let's venture
out into this acid thing.

261
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,220
Let's venture until this masculine thing.

262
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,990
It was a different name.

263
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:40,801
It was masculine,

264
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,750
but it really wasn't Mescalin Joe Rogan.

265
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,440
It was a little tag Elodie it
would know it wasn't even pay on.

266
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:48,360
It was a little thing I did the same,

267
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,863
excuse me.

268
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:51,900
Yeah,

269
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,733
Mba,

270
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,170
but masculine is what they
sell you in the south.

271
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,720
They supposedly put it
in Tequila or something.

272
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,881
This was Sao,

273
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:59,130
right?

274
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,401
Yeah,

275
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,420
and this is something that tube,

276
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,970
a little fucking white
kids made in a pill.

277
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:07,620
It was rat poison with something else
and something else and it was very tiny.

278
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,960
It was maybe a little size of this.

279
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,891
That's it.

280
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,360
And it came in aluminum foil.

281
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,100
Even smaller than that.

282
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,700
Wow.

283
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,930
Even smaller than that.

284
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,460
Way Smaller,

285
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,890
that little thing that that's it.

286
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,370
You paid $80 for it and you got a hundred
of those and you start looking at $3 a

287
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:30,621
piece and that would fuck you up for six
hours with a two hour Hayes in between

288
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,810
an hour buffer.

289
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,710
I want to come down and I did
that for three or four months.

290
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,080
Then they introduced me to THC crystal,

291
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,180
which is snorting.

292
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,770
They sold it as,

293
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,790
what we do is we got a bunch of
stems and seeds from the reefer.

294
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,480
We put it in a pot and we boil that pot
and whatever separate from the stems and

295
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:57,450
the that goes to the sides.

296
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:58,740
We scraped that off.

297
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,870
And that's where you snot in your nose.

298
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,860
Oh my God.

299
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,090
So I was,

300
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,153
I was,

301
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,510
I had like a personal karate rule,

302
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,960
but I would always just smoke
it and do the masculine,

303
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,060
but I was never going to
put nothing in my nose.

304
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,910
Oh you had a rule like a drug
addict puts something in their nose.

305
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:15,190
Right?

306
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,781
Like that's it.

307
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,970
Like that's a complete different range.

308
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,220
I'll never shoot heroin
and I'll never put,

309
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,770
especially at my karate
man as a carotid man.

310
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,480
Right.

311
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,570
Carotid morals.

312
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:24,960
Yeah.

313
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,880
I was just straight away with the reefer
and then I finally ended up snoring

314
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,590
that fucking gorilla biscuits shit.

315
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,150
Cause that's what it was.

316
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,200
It was angel dust.

317
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,090
They just like God told you.

318
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,520
And I went on an angel dust tab.

319
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,590
Like every Sunday me and my friend
Carlos Perez would buy a six pack of

320
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:44,424
Michelob.

321
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,101
He only like Mick,

322
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:46,560
a low.

323
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,860
He has to have good friends die.

324
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,590
This kind of special to
appear with the beer.

325
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,610
Will Pour,

326
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,750
must say something more

327
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,640
call.

328
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,400
It's about as low and brow.

329
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,450
