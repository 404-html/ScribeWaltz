1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,600
Three,
two,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,180
one knee.
Yes.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:06,980
Hello,
boy in.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,370
Hi there.
Welcome.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,570
Thank you.
Thanks for doing this.

6
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,430
I really appreciate it and I love what 
you're doing.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,790
I've seen your Ted Talk.
I've seen many in numerous conferences 

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,751
that you've appeared at and discussions 
you've given on this and for people to 

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
jump into this right now,
what you've done is think long and hard 

10
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,981
and devise a method to try to clean up 
some of the plastic that we have 

11
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,730
floating around in the ocean.
Famously,

12
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,840
the Pacific garbage patch is this 
enormous patch of garbage that's between

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,140
California and Hawaii.
How did you get involved in this and 

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,140
what,
what,

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,110
what?
You're a young guy.

16
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,760
How old are you?
Twenty three.

17
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,470
Already.
Twenty three already.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,880
You sound like,
oh my God.

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,520
How old were you when you started this?

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,300
Um,
I,

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,350
I think I started thinking about this 
when I was 16 and I found that this 

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:56,350
organization when I was 18,

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,670
that's crazy.
All you lazy fucks out there that are 16

24
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:02,320
years old that aren't doing shit with 
your life.

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,810
Just think about this kid.
That's amazing.

26
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,670
I'm so happy.
There's people like you in the world.

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:07,570
No,
thank you.

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Yeah.
So you started thinking about it when 

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,761
you were 16 and you know,
this is something that is extremely 

30
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,550
disturbing to anybody that's paid 
attention,

31
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:20,551
especially when you see the birds that 
have died with all these plastic bottle 

32
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:24,271
caps inside their bodies and you know,
you see their carcasses with these 

33
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:26,440
multicolored caps in them and they 
thought these things were food.

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,250
It was just one of the many,
many,

35
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:35,251
many problems that occur when you have 
plastic floating around and just 

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,630
enormous numbers and the ocean.

37
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,740
Sure.
Yeah.

38
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,660
I mean there's really three problems 
with this plastic.

39
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:43,300
First of all,
obviously the ecosystem damage.

40
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,330
I think they're right about 800 species 
that actually could go extinct because 

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,681
of this plastic pollution.
And then there's the economic threat in 

42
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,881
terms of damage to fisheries,
damage to tourism and things like that.

43
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,060
I think it's around $13 billion dollars 
a year according to the UN.

44
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,510
And then thirdly,
there's the health impact or the 

45
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:06,880
potential health impact because these 
tiny plastic pieces,

46
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,220
they actually ended up in the fish we 
eat,

47
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,860
uh,
that take chemicals with it.

48
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,310
And uh,
yeah,

49
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,310
that ends up on our dinner plate as 
well.

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,830
So what was it that prompted you to 
dedicate,

51
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,720
essentially dedicate your young life to 
this?

52
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:22,950
Sure.
Yeah.

53
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,951
So I've always been very passionate 
about technology and just building 

54
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:32,781
things.
I think sort of having an idea in your 

55
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,301
mind and then seeing that become reality
and be able to touch it and things like 

56
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:35,301
that.
I think,

57
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:39,850
uh,
there's literally no better feeling in 

58
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,320
the world than that.
So I've been building my own thing since

59
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:45,321
it was two years old I think for 
starting with things like tree houses 

60
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:49,401
and zip lines,
but then going into sort of computers 

61
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,370
and explosives and rockets and things 
like that,

62
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:54,030
which was a lot of fun,
but it wasn't very useful I would say.

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,640
Um,
so it's kind of looking for something,

64
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,430
sort of a,
something that real to,

65
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,690
to work on a real problem.
And that's what I then came across when 

66
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,580
I was 16 years old,
it was scuba diving in Greece and I came

67
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:10,330
across more plastic bags of fish and I 
wondered why can we just clean this up?

68
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
And uh,
that question sort of kept circling 

69
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,420
around in my head and um,
yeah,

70
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,190
I sort of thought about how could we do 
this.

71
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,820
The ocean is pretty big and then 
eventually came up with there's a dod to

72
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,920
use these natural ocean currents,
uh,

73
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,960
to let us collect the plastic.

74
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,300
And so how do you have many different 
prototypes?

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,070
Did you started with and you eventually 
wound up with what you have now and have

76
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,210
you started implementing them yet?

77
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,160
Oh yeah.
I mean,

78
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:42,161
so the,
the concept that was presented back in 

79
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:46,060
2012 with my first tedx stoke and if you
compare that to where we are right now,

80
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:50,210
it's sort of day and night of a 
difference.

81
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,700
So,
um,

82
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,730
yeah,
through testing and through all these 

83
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:56,730
prototypings um,
yeah,

84
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,760
obviously there has been a lot of 
development there,

85
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:03,761
but the key idea has stayed the same.
That instead of going after the plastic 

86
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:07,070
with boats and nets,
which will take roundabout 79,000

87
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:09,920
years to clean up just as great pacific 
garbage patch.

88
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,500
Instead of doing that,
we let the plastic come to us.

89
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,720
So we use a,
basically in network,

90
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,750
a fleet of very long floating barriers 
which are oriented in a u shape and they

91
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:22,690
float around and they kind of act like a
massive pacman.

92
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,960
So,
um,

93
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,860
yeah,
like a,

94
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,150
like a funnel brings the plastic towards
it,

95
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,600
the network ocean currents push it 
against,

96
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,280
it,
moves towards the center,

97
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,490
becomes very concentrated and wanted to 
concentrated well then it's easy to get 

98
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,280
it out and ship it to land for 
recycling.

99
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,300
It has this started yet,
um,

100
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,350
so with the past,
so we were founded four years ago in 

101
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,850
that time on one side we did the 
reconnaissance,

102
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:51,851
so we mapped the patch with 30 boats and
an airplane at the same time to really 

103
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:56,891
understand how much is out there,
which turns out to be one point 8 

104
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:57,890
trillion pieces floating in this great 
Pacific garbage patch.

105
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,420
Uh,
and on the other hand,

106
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:04,421
we've done all the testing.
So we've done hundreds of scale model 

107
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:08,111
tests,
we've done prototypes back in Europe on 

108
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,240
the Nazi and actually right now we're,
we're manufacturing the first real 

109
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,821
cleanup system which is scheduled to be 
launched from San Francisco to the Great

110
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,040
Pacific garbage patch around two or 
three months time.

111
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,160
So has anything been used,
like is there a proof of concept of have

112
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:29,161
you done like,
real large scale testing where you've 

113
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:29,320
shown that you can actually do this?

114
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,670
Well,
I mean we've done a lot of subsystem 

115
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:34,670
testing,
so the,

116
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:34,670
the prototypes in the North Sea for 
example,

117
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:39,261
where there were these 12 meters 
sections and we managed though to keep 

118
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:39,810
that in one piece.
So,

119
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,930
um,
but then also the plastic capturing that

120
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,950
worked very well in the lab.
Um,

121
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,030
but yeah,
the,

122
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,050
the real,
the real proof of course has to come 

123
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,231
from this one real system in the great 
pacific garbage patch collecting 

124
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:58,071
plastic.
And that's what we really hope to 

125
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:58,071
achieve this year.

126
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:58,071
So this is the one,
right?

127
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:58,250
The Great Pacific

128
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,930
garbage patch is the largest.
Yes,

129
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,450
because cal between California and 
Hawaii.

130
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,160
Hawaiian.
Yeah.

131
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,180
So the five areas in the world where our
plastic concentrates a,

132
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,100
this is by far the largest one,
therefore others,

133
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,560
uh,
but they are,

134
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,280
they combined Lee a contain less plastic
than this one in the,

135
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,400
in the nurses.
Do we know what it is?

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,240
Probably because of Asia.
So Asia has,

137
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,070
uh,
has quite a big problem in terms of that

138
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,960
they,
they use a lot of plastic but they don't

139
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:30,961
have a good infrastructure.
So by far the largest source of plastic 

140
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:32,480
flowing into the ocean is also this,
uh,

141
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,540
there's one continent and what's being 
released,

142
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,410
they're naturally by because of the 
currents ends up in the North Pacific.

143
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,720
It's such a strange problem because it 
wasn't something that was discussed in 

144
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,920
the eighties and the nineties.
It was nothing.

145
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,410
And then all of the sudden,
somewhere in the year 2000,

146
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:53,411
I remember hearing about the massive 
amount of plastic we have in the ocean 

147
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:53,570
and it just,
it just made sense.

148
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:54,080
I was like,
oh,

149
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,360
well of course,
of course it's going to wind up there.

150
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,970
But the sheer size of it is staggering.

151
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,270
Yeah.
And I think that to me the worrying 

152
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,420
thing is that it's a persistent problem.
So with many other kinds of pollution,

153
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:09,260
so when you sort of turn off the tap,
it's will be sold by itself.

154
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,280
Think about,
for example,

155
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,800
the,
the ozone hole with the cfcs,

156
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,690
uh,
but with this,

157
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,720
like if you turn off the tap,
the problem is still there and in 100 

158
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,530
years it will still be there.
So I think to really solve it,

159
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,210
you need to do two things.
One site,

160
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:24,950
we have to close the tap.
On the other hand,

161
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,060
we also need to clean it up.

162
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,270
Jamie just pulled up a size comparison 
where it shows one point 6 million 

163
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:38,201
square kilometers of area twice the size
of Texas or three times the size of 

164
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:38,510
France.

165
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,830
Yeah.
So this is a study we published a few a 

166
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,590
few weeks ago.
So this was the result of the 

167
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:46,590
recognizance effort.
Um,

168
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,240
and it's kind of funny,
like every other news outlet used at 

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,840
different size comparison.
So I think it was CNN that says,

170
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:54,920
what's the size of Mongolia?
Um,

171
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,460
we always use Texas.
Yeah,

172
00:07:57,461 --> 00:08:02,461
Texas is America.
We use Texas for everything four times 

173
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,010
of California as well.
So yeah,

174
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,120
it's pretty,
pretty big area.

175
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,460
It's insane.
And it's getting bigger,

176
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm sure.
Uh,

177
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,150
yeah.
So the,

178
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,910
the,
the area doesn't really change.

179
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:12,440
It's more of the,
the concentration concentration of it.

180
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,630
When did we realize that this was an 
issue like collectively scientists,

181
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,050
geologists,
so there hasn't been that have been sort

182
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:22,990
of small sampling efforts since the 
seventies.

183
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:26,800
So back then it was the first time 
plastic was described as being something

184
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:31,801
that floats in the ocean,
but it really only entered the public 

185
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:35,311
consciousness,
I think in the late nineties there was 

186
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:35,311
this,
uh,

187
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:36,840
this captain Charles Moore who,
um,

188
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,060
were sort of sailing through it and he 
saw this plastic and he was like,

189
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,000
we need to describe this.
And then he did a,

190
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,740
a scientific paper on it and yeah.
And actually I think he was the one that

191
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:50,320
turned the term great pacific garbage 
patch.

192
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,700
He was riding his boat through it for a 
long period of time,

193
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,620
I guess.
Yeah,

194
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,510
I think it was,
um,

195
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,810
it was participating in some sailing 
race and he went through it and then,

196
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,990
yeah,
he just saw that.

197
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,370
So he was the sort of the canary in the 
coal mine,

198
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,800
I guess.
Yeah.

199
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,110
What is it,
one of those things where it's hard to 

200
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,900
get different governments to act on this
because you know,

201
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,010
like who's responsible for it?

202
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,280
The ocean.
Yeah,

203
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,220
I think it's a sort of tragic tragedy of
the Commons,

204
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:23,260
right?
Where it's international waters,

205
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,320
sort of everyone's problem,
but at the same time legally it's no 

206
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,320
problem.
So,

207
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,870
um,
yeah,

208
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,940
and besides that,
what I really felt when I started the 

209
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,690
ocean cleanup was that I think everyone 
wanted this problem to be solved,

210
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,510
but at the same time we didn't really 
have a way to do it.

211
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:44,230
There was somebody wasn't any technology
to do that and that's why I thought,

212
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:48,220
well perhaps this is an opportunity to 
combine my interests,

213
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,600
have a,
solving this problem,

214
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:52,000
but b,
also developing technology,

215
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,550
which is what we did.
Is there anyone else doing this?

216
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,510
So there are many organizations working 
on the,

217
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
on the prevention insight,
right?

218
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:02,950
So educating people,
thinking about policies,

219
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:05,500
those kinds of things,
which is very important I think.

220
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,540
Uh,
but uh,

221
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:11,541
yeah,
unfortunately we're the only ones that 

222
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,090
sort of do the technology side of it and
yeah,

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I wish more people would do it.
If somebody else would clean the ocean,

224
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,200
that'd be fine with us as well.
Uh,

225
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:23,060
but until somebody else does it,
yeah,

226
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,370
we were kind of the ones that have to 
do.

227
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,680
That's so fascinating to me that other 7
billion people on the planet sometimes 

228
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,941
it really does just take one person to,
to act one person,

229
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:37,700
do something about something that,
I mean I'm aware of many people aware of

230
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,730
many people listening have heard about 
this and that and it's sort of one of 

231
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,821
those things that's in the back of your 
mind that doesn't affect you on a daily 

232
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:45,821
basis.
So you say,

233
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:46,670
well that's a tragedy.
That's a terrible thing,

234
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:50,000
but it's not my problem.
I have my own problems.

235
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,820
But you was one person decided to do 
something about it.

236
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:58,821
And the fact that you did when you were 
16 is so fascinating to me and someone 

237
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,790
has to do it right,
but isn't that weird?

238
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,630
Someone has to,
but nobody was doing shit until you came

239
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,820
along.
That's very interesting.

240
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

241
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,610
I sometimes wonder sometimes people ask 
me like why,

242
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,640
why do you do it?
And like the as my answer would be like 

243
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
why not?
Why isn't everyone doing it?

244
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,500
My one thing that I was thinking was,
and this isn't my same feeling about 

245
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,160
pollution,
air pollution,

246
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,630
is that once they figured out a way to 
use whatever's in the particular,

247
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:34,980
it's an air pollution as a resource.
Sure.

248
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:40,090
And make it valuable.
Then people are going to be running to 

249
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,911
extract it out of the skies.
And I felt the same way about the 

250
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,851
Pacific garbage patch and all the other 
ocean currents where they have this 

251
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:46,570
issue.
So what is it?

252
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,580
The currents bring everything together 
collectively into one area just because 

253
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,670
of the way the ocean moves.

254
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,350
Exactly.
So you have these sort of the,

255
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,650
the current at the equator and then you 
have these boundary currents and it sort

256
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,720
of acts like the,
um,

257
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,940
like the sinking your best up.
Right?

258
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,160
So it's sort of where all the plastic 
wants to go.

259
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,360
Now.
Is it possible to take that stuff,

260
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,450
all of that Pacif,
all those disgusting particles and use 

261
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,450
it for something?
Yeah,

262
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,170
I mean,
sure.

263
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,790
I'm actually a few examples with me.
I'm in a bank but not here right now.

264
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,620
Grab it.
Do you want to go grab it?

265
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,260
No,
I'll do it a bit.

266
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,000
I can describe it.
Okay.

267
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,350
It's podcasts anyways.
So,

268
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,360
um,
so what we do is we take the plastic out

269
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,760
and we um,
we recycled that,

270
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:38,520
we've developed a process for this and 
we can turn it into new products,

271
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,530
actually the pair of sunglasses that are
finally being able to wear after a 

272
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:43,810
dreaded northern European winter.

273
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,790
They were already made that out of 
plastic that we took out of the Great 

274
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,540
Pacific garbage patch.
And you're wearing sunglasses that are 

275
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:54,540
recycled from the ocean.
Exactly.

276
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,360
And the idea is that we can do anything 
with this,

277
00:12:55,361 --> 00:13:00,361
right,
so you can imagine sort of the part of 

278
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:03,661
your next car or your chair or whatever,
you can make that out of ocean plastic 

279
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,760
and what we think is that the material 
itself isn't valuable enough,

280
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
but it's really the story behind it.
So the fact that you can say,

281
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,750
well it's made out of the Great Pacific 
garbage patch which we think will add 

282
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,441
value.
So it's like the difference between a 

283
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:20,620
normal pebble and the piece of the 
Berlin Wall,

284
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,250
it's one is worth shit and the other is 
worth something.

285
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,950
So that's what we kind of want to use as
a way to,

286
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,520
to then be able to fund the operations 
of the clinic.

287
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,850
I think that's a fantastic idea and I 
think that'll be a huge value for 

288
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:35,850
people.

289
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,050
I mean,
I think people really want to buy 

290
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,241
something that they know is recycled out
of something that was choking fish and 

291
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:42,310
birds to death.
Yeah.

292
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,120
And not only that,
but he does his turning plastic from the

293
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:51,121
ocean into $200 shoes.
Sports sportswear maker is teaming up 

294
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,470
with something to sell three new shoes 
made with plastic pulled from the ocean.

295
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,660
It's like,
wow,

296
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,530
that's awesome for the kind of stuff you
can do.

297
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
So in this example,
so I did,

298
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:00,910
I,
she didn't use a plastic from the ocean.

299
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:05,911
They,
I think they just said that for 

300
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,960
marketing reasons,
they make that from plastic that sort 

301
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,440
of,
they call it ocean bound.

302
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,220
So.
Oh,

303
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,860
those lie motherfuckers.
God dammit.

304
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,060
They got them.
Yeah.

305
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,200
That's bullshit.
So it's on the way to the ocean.

306
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,680
Yeah.
Which I guess is any,

307
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,770
could be anything.
It was like we were going to throw it 

308
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:23,770
up,
make sneakers.

309
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:23,770
Right.
Oh,

310
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,590
that's horrible.
Oh,

311
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,640
it's still catching venture.
Perhaps some of those.

312
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,890
Do you have some of those that.
They're very cool.

313
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,470
I liked,
I liked them and I liked the people that

314
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,200
work on it and everything,
but that's a lie.

315
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,730
Yeah.
Well yeah,

316
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,120
a white light a little bit.
Yeah.

317
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,720
Um,
but uh,

318
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,870
yeah,
so I mean the composition of the plastic

319
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:48,970
that we'll be pulling out of the ocean 
is pretty unique.

320
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,971
It's a,
it's quite degraded because of the 

321
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:54,540
decades of UV light heading it,
so,

322
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,350
so we really had to develop a new 
process to do this,

323
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:02,351
so probably maybe a year so it will be 
actually be able to launch the first 

324
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,700
line of products made out of sort of 
real the real deal.

325
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,620
The plastic actually coming out of the 
ocean.

326
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,250
That's excellent.

327
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,300
So you're going to sell like raw plastic
and is there an issue of who owns the 

328
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:17,401
plastic?
I mean even [inaudible] is in the 

329
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:17,800
Commons of the ocean in international 
waters.

330
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,150
I think it'd be hilarious if somebody 
would sort of raise their hand and say,

331
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,070
oh,
that's my plastic.

332
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:27,071
I put it in there,
then we have another kind of legal 

333
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,730
issue.
But if it becomes a resource like oil.

334
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

335
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:35,141
I think there's some,
the salvage laws that say if a few sort 

336
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,040
of salvage something into the shoe 
oceans,

337
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,850
you can actually keep it.
So that doesn't appear to be a,

338
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,270
an issue.
Uh,

339
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,350
but yeah,
definitely it will be a sort of closing 

340
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,670
the circle and will be a fun project 
too.

341
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,340
Yeah,
I mean it sounds,

342
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,710
it sounds like an amazing thing and I 
guarantee people would be very,

343
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:58,711
very interested to buy things that they 
know we're made out of something that 

344
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:00,230
was really a horrible

345
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,110
side effect of civilization.
Yeah.

346
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:07,080
I think if you have the choice between a
normal.

347
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,600
Let's use this sunglass example.
Yeah,

348
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,180
a normal pair or a pair of coming out of
the ocean.

349
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,370
I think nine out of 10 people would 
choose the latter.

350
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,320
Oh,
for sure.

351
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:17,450
I mean I think it would be giant for 
companies to,

352
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:22,451
to advertise that we only use 100 
percent recycled from the ocean plastic 

353
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:27,191
and when exactly that would be gigantic.
Now how long do you think it would be 

354
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:28,160
before this could be a reality?

355
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,750
Um,
so the first system it's currently being

356
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:36,751
assembled,
so we are renting a former naval base 

357
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:40,200
in,
at the San Francisco Bay where it's 

358
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,620
currently being put together.
It's still relatively small system.

359
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:46,621
It's 2000 feet in length.
So eventually there'll be almost a 

360
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:46,720
double the size,
but this is,

361
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,010
this one will be launched in pretty late
June,

362
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,370
early July.
Uh,

363
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:57,371
then we'll take it out the first,
the first deployment will not yet be 

364
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,950
directly in the patch,
so we're just deploying it ran 300 miles

365
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,590
of the coast just to make sure that it 
works well.

366
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:07,591
Sort of a final rehearsal if that goes 
well then by probably around August we 

367
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:12,331
should be ready to take it all the way 
to the patch and hopefully soon after 

368
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,351
that,
collect the first plastic and then we 

369
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:18,331
hope to have the first shipment of first
plastic back back in port before the end

370
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:25,050
of the year.
And we think that will be such a 

371
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,050
symbolic moment for,
for 60 years,

372
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,640
man has been putting plastic into the 
ocean and from that moment onwards we're

373
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:28,900
also taking it back out again.

374
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,490
That's amazing.
And you feel like you can get 40 percent

375
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,050
of the garbage patch in 10 years.

376
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,800
It's actually.
So with a fleet of 60 of these cleanup 

377
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,851
systems,
we should be able to clean up half this 

378
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:42,851
great pacific garbage patch every five 
years,

379
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,870
which of course the more honorable um,
yeah,

380
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:51,871
I mean,
and you could get faster if you want 

381
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:51,871
more,
if you put in more systems.

382
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,170
Of course.
Where are you guys getting funding from?

383
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Um,
so so far we've been very generously 

384
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,470
supported by but mostly individuals 
actually.

385
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:03,471
So uh,
ranging from people that just donate 50 

386
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:06,561
bucks to two people like Marc Benioff,
the founder of salesforce and couple of 

387
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,030
other very high net worth individuals.

388
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,980
If someone wanted to donate,
how would they do?

389
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:11,310
So

390
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,320
yeah,
just go to the website,

391
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:17,280
the ocean cleanup.com
and feel free to get in touch with us.

392
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,160
So mostly individuals,
mostly wealthy philanthropists.

393
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Yeah.
So that has gotten us to around 35 to 

394
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,870
$40,000,000
right now,

395
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,250
which has been enough to fund all these 
years of research and development,

396
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,360
the whole mapping of the patch as well 
as the construction of this first system

397
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,140
right now.
So,

398
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,030
uh,
so that should get us to the point where

399
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,880
we're sort of proven technology.
And then for the scaleup,

400
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,050
the idea is that basically any company 
can,

401
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,080
can go and fund their own system.
We estimate the cost of every system to 

402
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,840
be around 5 million.
Um,

403
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,120
basically you,
um,

404
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,460
you know,
the system will be around a kilometer,

405
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:55,550
that's plenty of space for logos.
The world is watching.

406
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,940
So it's like this massive billboard 
floating out there.

407
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,060
So,
uh,

408
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:01,920
so the idea is that any company can sort
of fund or are individual,

409
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:02,210
even

410
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,540
some of the racist Nike can be like,
fuck you,

411
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,700
Adidas were actually doing this for 
real.

412
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,440
Just kidding.
Adidas,

413
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,890
that will be Hillary.
It would be hilarious.

414
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,320
So what is the process in taking the 
plastic from the ocean and converting 

415
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,020
into usable plastic like that you would 
use in sunglasses?

416
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,160
Um,
so,

417
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,260
uh,
the first thing you'd do is you can have

418
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,930
your washer do sorted,
you scrub it to,

419
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:29,260
to get you so disease,
very clean,

420
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,340
sort of a fragments of plastic.
Uh,

421
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,490
then we,
uh,

422
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,610
we do.
There's a process called compounding 

423
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,320
where you sort of remelted and add some,
some additives and make it into what you

424
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:42,810
call pellets.
So these are sort of these,

425
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:48,090
uh,
beat sized particles which can be fed 

426
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,631
into any machine in the world.
So say an Ikea machine for furniture or 

427
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,200
tesla machine for,
for cars.

428
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,270
Um,
and um,

429
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,370
yeah,
so that process we can add to custom 

430
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,360
develops tailor made for,
for our feedstock because it's such a 

431
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,430
unique composition.

432
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,700
That's amazing.
It's really fascinating because I think 

433
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,061
that that will be a hugely desirable 
form of construction.

434
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Like if you can prove that the plastic 
that you use was made and is actually,

435
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,440
it's a benefit to,
to get that plastic and make things out 

436
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,440
of it.

437
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,660
Yeah,
I mean the,

438
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,750
it's still more expensive obviously than
just normal plastic because we have to 

439
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,461
collect it from 1200 miles off shore,
but on the other hand,

440
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:41,290
so just by selling it as plastic,
I don't think that will be a good 

441
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,000
business,
but making it into sort of going further

442
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:48,001
into value chain up to the consumer.
I think that can make sense because 

443
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:48,910
again,
to use the sunglass example,

444
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:52,480
it's probably around a 100 grams of 
material,

445
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,820
uh,
so that would take about a maybe a 

446
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,350
dollar to collect and you know,
what's a dollar on the hundred and $20 

447
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,980
pair of sunglasses.
Right.

448
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,270
So,
um,

449
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,640
so I think that really going at all the 
way up to,

450
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:11,641
in the value chain,
that's where you can really add the 

451
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:11,641
value.

452
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:11,641
Well,
you know,

453
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:15,620
one of the things that was shocking to 
me when I was investigating plastic is 

454
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,940
that I didn't know that plastic you can 
make plastic out of hemp.

455
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,090
The hemp plastic is actually 
biodegradable.

456
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,670
Yeah.
And sugar cane.

457
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:27,320
And there's many sort of bio based types
of plastic that the thing is though,

458
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:29,060
that there's,
this is very,

459
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,180
very sort of complicated and 
controversial world of sort sorted the 

460
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,180
bioplastics,
uh,

461
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,240
because you have something called 
biobased and biodegradable,

462
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:41,660
so you can make plastic out of say 
sugarcane,

463
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,090
uh,
which is chemically exactly the same as 

464
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,901
plastic that it was made from crude oil 
and it would take the same amount of 

465
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:55,181
time for a two degree.
So a base doesn't necessarily mean that 

466
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,530
it's biodegradable and vice versa,
so,

467
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,190
so it's um,
it's a very complicated world that even 

468
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,970
sometimes her experts on this on plastic
pollution being confused about it.

469
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:09,920
So let alone sort of the general 
population.

470
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,530
So uh,
and in,

471
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,540
in short,
there isn't yet sort of the holy grill 

472
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,421
of this type of plastic that on one hand
is very good in terms of performance in 

473
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,910
a usable life.
And then when it,

474
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,210
for example,
enter the ocean just degrades in,

475
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,370
in a matter of days or months.
So,

476
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,630
uh,
but I think that would be,

477
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,010
you know,
there will be a great innovation.

478
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,350
Is the quality of biodegradable plastic 
inferior to bio based but non 

479
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,530
biodegradable.

480
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,580
Yeah.
Or it's.

481
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,670
And it's mostly limited in terms of 
applications so you can really get 

482
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:43,670
everything

483
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,690
like the actual physical plastic.
Does it feel different to the touch 

484
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:48,690
it's.
Have you?

485
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,540
Yeah.
So it's,

486
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,570
it usually makes more noise.
It's more sort of crumbly,

487
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,230
so it's brittle or something.
Right.

488
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,850
Interesting.
Well that makes sense.

489
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:58,840
Right?
Obviously it's going to.

490
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,840
So if you're going to make water bottles
out of biodegradable plastic,

491
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:02,530
they're probably going to leak.

492
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,950
Yeah,
yeah.

493
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,030
That's yeah,
that.

494
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,280
That's not possible yet.
So they're compostable.

495
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:10,710
That's another thing.
You have compostable plastic,

496
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:13,980
which,
which you can use for water bottles,

497
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,100
but then the only way for it to degrade 
who'd be to be in sort of this 

498
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,640
industrial composter,
we have a temperature of 100 degrees and

499
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,590
pressure and things like that and it 
would integrate in the ocean.

500
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:28,980
So it's a.
it's a very complicated area.

501
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,970
Third had Paul stamets on who's in my 
colleges and he was talking about all 

502
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:40,861
the different fungus that could be 
potentially engineered to eat plastic.

503
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,830
This is another thing that they're 
working on.

504
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,640
Yeah.
So that,

505
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:45,990
that

506
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,620
of course it would be great to have on 
landfills and things like sheets.

507
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,060
It's a.
it's a process that we're also 

508
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,580
investigating for our recycling because 
one thing you could do is you could take

509
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:59,530
that plastic and then using either 
enzymes or indeed fung,

510
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,690
fung guy and things like that.
You could turn it back into biomass.

511
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,470
So from that biomass you could make 
anything else against it.

512
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:09,980
You could make a bio based plastic,
for example.

513
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,470
So does this change your relationship 
with plastic?

514
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,590
I mean,
when you sit there and you're drinking 

515
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,121
out of this plastic bottle,
do you think I'm going to have to clean 

516
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:20,121
this fucking thing up someday?

517
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:21,030
Yeah,
I,

518
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,870
yeah,
but on the Ariana and also not against 

519
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,840
plastic because I realized that without 
plastic,

520
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,380
say modern medicine will be very 
difficult.

521
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:38,070
That plastic lot more food waste would 
be produced and without plastic we 

522
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,751
wouldn't be able to clean the ocean.
Big Ocean actually a lot of the 

523
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:42,751
components of our cleanup system 
actually.

524
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:45,040
Maybe we can pull up an image of the 
thing being built right now.

525
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,000
Um,
so that's actually a lot of the parts of

526
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:51,810
that are made out of plastic.
So,

527
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,910
um,
so,

528
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,610
so it's kind of ironic.
It's poetic embolism.

529
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,360
Yeah.
Here it is very far.

530
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,530
Solving fire with fire.
So yes,

531
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:06,700
I don't think we can live without 
plastic and I don't think we should want

532
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:11,701
to.
I think it's really just about managing 

533
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:12,130
the material in a way that it doesn't 
end up in the ocean,

534
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:17,131
which means that it ed comes back to the
material being valuable enough at the 

535
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:21,810
end of life because if,
if it's cheaper to recycle than to not 

536
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,010
recycle will,
then obviously it would happen and there

537
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:25,660
needs to be good infrastructure for 
that.

538
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,700
And then I think as a final,
sort of a final safety net,

539
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,760
we need technologies like this to sort 
of intercepted in river mouths as well 

540
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,740
as sort of clean up the legacy of the 60
years that we're having in the middle of

541
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:43,741
the ocean.
But I don't think we can live with that 

542
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:43,741
place.

543
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:43,741
No,
I don't think so.

544
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:43,741
Either.
Not yet.

545
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:48,200
And are when you're looking at the water
and you see the plastic that is in this 

546
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:50,870
Pacific garbage patch on the other,
the other four patches,

547
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,810
how deep does that plastic go from the 
surface?

548
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Um,
so for most of the plastic really stays 

549
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,080
on our near the surface.
So we've,

550
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,990
we've done expedition student for that 
too to measure it.

551
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,210
And that's actually why our system only 
goes three meters deep because that's so

552
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,000
below that,
there's virtually no plastic anymore.

553
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,780
Interesting.
So it was only about nine feet.

554
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,780
So when your,
when your trunk,

555
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,520
when you see the little tiny itty bitty 
pieces,

556
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,210
it seems like as the plastic breaks down
over decades,

557
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:25,860
it becomes like almost like a gelatinous
sort of chunky thing.

558
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,840
It's called microplastics are.
You've sort of these particles that look

559
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,580
a bit almost like grains of sand,
right?

560
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Uh,
which are sort of really small.

561
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,950
Even those we measured our primarily in 
those top three meters or nine feet in.

562
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,820
Um,
so,

563
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,310
and,
and another surprising finding,

564
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,020
I think from,
from those explanations,

565
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:51,021
was that still more than 99 percent of 
the plastic is larger than a millimeter.

566
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:55,200
So larger than those,
those very tiny pieces,

567
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,560
which means that on one hand,
I think that's good news because that 

568
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,731
means it's not too late because 
obviously the smaller to get the more 

569
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:06,270
harmful they get a,
they end up in the food chain,

570
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:08,270
but they also are harder to clean up.
Right?

571
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,300
So,
uh,

572
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,890
so it's 100,
it's not too late.

573
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,960
So it's the good,
the good news I think,

574
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:17,961
but on the other hand,
it also means that there's still 99 

575
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:19,590
percent of a plastic out there that,
uh,

576
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,800
over the next few decades will become 
microplastics as well if we don't clean 

577
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,481
it up.
So there's sort of this ticking time 

578
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:29,481
bomb out there that um,
you know,

579
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,730
if we just leave it there,
the amount of microplastics could 

580
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,231
increase over a hundred fold over the 
next few decades and then we will be in 

581
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:36,231
a,
in a,

582
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:36,290
in March,

583
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,120
worse situation than we are today.
So have marine biologists done studies 

584
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,830
on the impact in that particular area in
terms of populations of fish and marine 

585
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:47,410
life?

586
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,340
Uh,
yeah.

587
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:53,341
So,
so there's many species that are being 

588
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,940
affected on one side due to ingestion on
the,

589
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,450
on the other side through entanglement.
So actually another finding of our study

590
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:05,451
was that almost half of the plastic by 
mass is things like ropes and fishing 

591
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:08,430
nets,
which of course disastrous.

592
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,560
Well first of all,
four propellers for,

593
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,500
for boats that go out.

594
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,110
Oh,
photo indeed.

595
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,130
So arena,
terrible photo of a,

596
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,330
a turtle that,
I mean it looks like it's caught in a 

597
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,961
bush,
it's just this massive net that this 

598
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:25,870
thing is swimming around with this thing
attached to his body.

599
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:31,170
That's one of the things that I was 
going to ask you about is cleaning up 

600
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,351
the nets because uh,
we had talked to someone who was 

601
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:37,800
explaining that every time they fish,
a lot of times they'll cut the nets 

602
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,410
lose.
Yeah.

603
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,280
So it's probably a combination of 
accidental loss and intentional lots.

604
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:50,010
But yeah,
I mean this amount of net really was 

605
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,380
quite,
quite staggering.

606
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,400
And did you,
do you remember who was bringing that 

607
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,400
up,
Jamie?

608
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,220
Somebody.
Somebody brought that up that they just 

609
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,680
released the nets and that it's 
commonplace and it was stunning because 

610
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:00,680
we were like,
what?

611
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,310
Every time they do that,
yeah,

612
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,360
the netscape cut in,
they get damaged so they just cut the 

613
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,050
nets loose and the nets are plastic too.
So.

614
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,810
But that's insane that that's legal,
that they do that,

615
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:12,020
that they don't have.
Yeah.

616
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,800
It's not Lego,
but it's not really legal.

617
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,860
No.
But they're lost for this.

618
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:19,450
But obviously,
how do you know that people do that?

619
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,440
It's very hard to,
to monitor the middle of the ocean.

620
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,530
Yeah,
I mean I guess you should probably have 

621
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:27,530
some sort of a gps tracking on your net.

622
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,330
Yeah,
I mean that could be one thing.

623
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,690
Or You could think about a need market 
based solutions where there will be a 

624
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,560
financial incentive if they bring their 
nets.

625
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,050
Sure.

626
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Yeah.
In some sort of a penalization if they 

627
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:42,340
don't.
What is this Jamie?

628
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,400
The impact and abandoned ocean fishing 
nets on marine life.

629
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,140
Chris Ryan or Duncan.
Oh,

630
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:48,460
okay.
That makes sense.

631
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:50,980
Google says,
Oh man,

632
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,080
that is just so.
It's so sad that it's such a wasteful,

633
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,280
dismissive sort of thing to do.
Just cut it loose and it's gone.

634
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,180
It's in the ocean.
No worries.

635
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,040
Sure.
So that's,

636
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,450
I mean that's a very obvious kind of 
impact.

637
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:12,290
And then another thing that was also a 
study done recently,

638
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:17,291
so we looked at the,
the concentrations of plastic versus 

639
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,790
naturally occurring the marine life in 
this garbage patch.

640
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,820
And then what we saw was that there is 
180 times more plastic at the surface.

641
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,930
Then sort of natural food for birds and 
turtles and things like that.

642
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:34,310
So you can imagine if you are a turtle 
at the surface of this garbage patch and

643
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:39,311
you sort of take a bite to eat,
there's 180 times larger chance that you

644
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:41,930
eat plastic rather than a piece of 
plankton.

645
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,230
Right?
Um,

646
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,300
and what we found was that this 
concentration is so high that it 

647
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,830
connection.
You have this chemical impact,

648
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,800
uh,
where um,

649
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,860
yeah,
where these chemicals have a potential 

650
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:55,970
health impact on these organisms as well
as um,

651
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:00,440
a species further up the food food web,
including US humans.

652
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,750
So have we noticed that?
Have people been tested and shown to 

653
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:11,511
have ingested plastic that they've 
gotten through eating tuna or something 

654
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:11,550
like that.

655
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,920
So the plastic itself isn't the thing 
that chemicals,

656
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,860
chemicals that are attached to the 
plastic.

657
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,180
And for example you see is that,
for example,

658
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:27,181
in Greenland,
like the native communities that really 

659
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:28,360
rely on fish,
they have much higher cancer rates.

660
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,950
They have a much higher concentrations 
of mercury,

661
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,970
other heavy metals as well as these 
persistent organic pollutants.

662
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,300
He thinks that attached to the press,
to the plastic in Greenland.

663
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,550
Yeah,
like the,

664
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,560
like these sort of these native 
communities that rely on fish and other 

665
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,900
sea life

666
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:52,300
there to eat.
This is a recent trend that they have 

667
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,300
higher rates of cancer.

668
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Um,
yeah.

669
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,660
I don't know how recent it is,
but the past few decades I can imagine.

670
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:59,270
But yeah,
that's really linked to their,

671
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,850
their marine,
uh,

672
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,880
the consumption of marine sources.
But um,

673
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,890
you know,
obviously it's hard to say well how many

674
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,470
percent of that is just heavy metals.
Yeah.

675
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,710
For as far as what's coming by plastic.
But sure,

676
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,020
if you,
um,

677
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,260
if you look at the kind of chemicals and
you look at the lab tests that they've 

678
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,520
done with that,
those chemicals.

679
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,380
Yeah.
They are not very good for you.

680
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,830
No,
I've heard that if you leave a water 

681
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:26,830
bottle like this in your car and it gets
hot out,

682
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,250
that the water will,
a plastic will leach into the water.

683
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:31,820
So.
Correct.

684
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,070
Yeah.
So I think it depends on the kind of 

685
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,070
plastic,
but you have,

686
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,960
I think with this prayer,
the liner would contain salads and 

687
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,690
things like that.
So,

688
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:42,680
um,
yeah,

689
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,120
I wouldn't do that.
Um,

690
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,180
so there's,
you know,

691
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,680
when you look at this chemicals you 
have,

692
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,760
you have two kinds of things you should 
I think worry about.

693
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:54,761
One is the chemicals that are actually 
in the plastic and secondly there's 

694
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:58,270
these chemicals that just float around 
in the ocean and then can attach to the 

695
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:58,870
plastic,
uh,

696
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,930
when they,
um,

697
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,780
because they sort of act like this 
chemical sponge,

698
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,050
the plastic wants to repel water and 
those chemicals too.

699
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,270
So they kind of act like a magnet 
towards each other.

700
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,690
Um,
and especially the latter one is well 

701
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:13,690
studied and we see that a lot on the,
on the,

702
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,810
on,
on the plastic.

703
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,880
Uh,
but the,

704
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,360
the former one,
yeah,

705
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,510
it's even an issue here.
If in your car,

706
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,640
for example,
it's an issue in your car,

707
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,720
like also.
Yeah.

708
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,680
Well if you leave it like in a hot car 
and.

709
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,090
Right,
right.

710
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:26,300
Right.

711
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:31,590
Now the question was,
is even if you're scooping out all that 

712
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:36,811
plastic out of the ocean,
is it still leaving chemicals that will,

713
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:38,530
will never be able to get up?

714
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,290
Um,
so I think the chemicals mostly actually

715
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:47,310
it,
it collects more chemicals than it sort 

716
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,310
of leaches out.
So,

717
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,790
uh,
because of those,

718
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,940
those sort of legacy chemicals like the,
the pcbs and ddt sort of things that we 

719
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:59,391
use for a insulators.
And I'm a pesticide spec in the maybe 

720
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:04,170
the forties to sixties.
So these,

721
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:06,370
um,
these actually,

722
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:06,990
um,
uh,

723
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,010
the,
the plastic attracts those chemicals.

724
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:10,030
So,
uh,

725
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:15,031
in a way you kind of also remove a bit 
of those chemicals and we actually have 

726
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:18,301
to wash them out before we do the 
recycling because you don't want those 

727
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:18,301
in your,

728
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:22,060
your products.
So there's actually some sort of a 

729
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,060
benefit to having those plastics in the 
water.

730
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,200
I mean,
not that you would encourage people to 

731
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,200
put in the water,
but there is some,

732
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,690
some natural benefit.

733
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,690
Um,
yeah,

734
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,000
I mean it's sort of.
Yeah,

735
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,730
I mean I,
I cannot really say how many percent of 

736
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,750
those legacy chemicals we would be 
pulling out with the plastic,

737
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:38,370
but yeah,
I mean you could say,

738
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:41,820
you could argue it's sort of an added 
benefit to removing it.

739
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,270
Not sure having plastic in here

740
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:49,050
now have you extended this line of 
thinking to some of the other problems 

741
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,260
in the ocean,
like these heavy metals?

742
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,060
Um,
well,

743
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:56,920
so I really hope is that the cleanup can
sort of become a symbol of how we should

744
00:34:56,921 --> 00:35:01,900
use or how we should use technology to 
solve problems of our time.

745
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,680
So when you,
um,

746
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,750
and I think a lot of it comes down to 
that we shouldn't sort of protest what 

747
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,730
we shouldn't agree with it,
but we should build the things we should

748
00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:14,900
build a future that we do agree with.
Um,

749
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,160
so when you look at the past few hundred
years of modernity in our civilization,

750
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:27,580
what we see is dramatic positive trends 
in terms of health,

751
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:29,440
wealth,
education,

752
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:31,430
violence,
and we had steven pinker on your show,

753
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,460
right?
Um,

754
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,060
so I think that's really,
really positive trends.

755
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,200
We've done a good job in that.
And that all comes down to our ability 

756
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,750
to sort of imagine things that don't 
exist yet.

757
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:49,950
So it was sort of technology and 
innovation and being able to work,

758
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,380
uh,
work together in an effective way,

759
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,120
which is think about the corporation.

760
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,840
Um,
so,

761
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,890
so I think those have been,
um,

762
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:04,090
sort of very good trends and I think 
what we should do is we should also 

763
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,701
think about how to apply those to the 
area outside of our own species and to 

764
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,280
the rest of the environment because when
you look at all those positive trends 

765
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,790
over the past few hundred years,
um,

766
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,890
and then yeah,
that's all good.

767
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:20,760
But there's one very big exception which
is the impact to the environment.

768
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:25,761
It's almost like we've had all the 
success at the cost of the environment 

769
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:28,500
and,
but I think that instead of there's some

770
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:32,370
people that have sort of a more 
reactionary field to this and they say,

771
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:35,970
well,
look at all these problems.

772
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:39,180
It was created by businesses and by 
technology.

773
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:42,030
So we should stay as far away from those
things as possible.

774
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,300
And I think that's sort of,
um,

775
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,440
you know,
that's sort of stupid.

776
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:51,530
I think that it really just shows that 
these are very powerful ways of getting 

777
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:57,711
things done and I think a much more 
effective way was to sort of apply that 

778
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:02,210
what has worked in other areas and then 
also apply that to the area of the 

779
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:02,210
environment.
So,

780
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,390
so I don't think,
you know,

781
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,500
I,
for example,

782
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:09,501
think that the,
the car problem is not going to be 

783
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:09,501
solved by bending cars I think is going 
to be sold,

784
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:11,570
but electric cars and I don't think the,
the,

785
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,180
the pollution problem is going to be 
solved by everyone becoming Vegan.

786
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:20,181
I think it's going to be solved by 
things like lab grown meat and other 

787
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:21,320
kinds of alternatives.
Um,

788
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,730
so,
and that's why I also think that,

789
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:24,510
um,
yeah,

790
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,570
the ocean cleanup or the plastic 
pollution problem is not going to be 

791
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,250
solved by sort of people trying to do 
their own little bits.

792
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:37,251
And I'm trying to live without plastic 
or things like that I think is going to 

793
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:38,230
be solved by,
um,

794
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,060
you know,
things like plastics that do not harm to

795
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:47,061
the environment as well as technologies 
like the ocean cleanup to sort of clean 

796
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:47,610
up after itself.
So,

797
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,870
um,
yeah,

798
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:52,800
and I hope that there can be a sort of a
symbol of that approach.

799
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,110
I like what you just said there because 
I,

800
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,130
I've always thought that technology will
most likely sort out most of these 

801
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:06,211
issues if we apply enough attention to 
it and that one of the real issues is 

802
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,890
when someone creates some sort of a new 
technology,

803
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:13,891
they really don't have the ability to 
see 50 years down the line what's going 

804
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,840
to happen with the side effects,
the residual effects.

805
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,720
And I think that's a big part of what 
happened with plastic.

806
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,720
And I don't think the solution is,
you know,

807
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,430
making an accent of a piece of rock and 
living in the woods.

808
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:29,870
I think that the solution is trying to 
have a long term comprehensive approach 

809
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:36,691
to how we use various technologies and 
also various resources so that we don't 

810
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:42,010
have another pacific garbage patch and 
some new technology 5,100,

811
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:47,011
200 years from now.
I mean if you went to the ocean 200 

812
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:47,011
years ago,
you'd see none of this.

813
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,640
So this is a very,
very,

814
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:52,390
very recent issue that's compounding at 
a staggering rate.

815
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,970
Sure.
Yeah.

816
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,500
I agree with what you say there and 
it's.

817
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,350
Yeah,
it's,

818
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,090
it's really just about,
uh,

819
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:06,091
so I don't think.
I think there's other people that think 

820
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:07,830
that technology is inherently neutral.
It's not good or bad,

821
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,240
but I think that's not true.
If you compare,

822
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I know some bio terrorist weapon which 
you could event or you could invent a 

823
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,841
machine to clean the ocean,
I would say I would argue those are not 

824
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,590
equally a good things to,
to develop.

825
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:27,591
So when technology isn't a inheriting 
neutral means it's sort of 

826
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:32,121
deterministic.
So the inventor kind of puts a certain 

827
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:36,230
direction in the product already and I 
think that can be used in our advantage 

828
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,151
or to phrase it differently.
I think there is a responsibility at 

829
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:45,380
with inventors and entrepreneurs to 
build things that are more good than bad

830
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:51,561
and actually plastic.
I would still argue that plastic is a 

831
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:53,610
net positive technology and it was 
invented as a solution.

832
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,010
Uh,
it saves a lot of weights,

833
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,910
a lot of people got hurt when,
when people use glass bottles and things

834
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:04,911
like that.
So back in the day this was invented as 

835
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:05,220
a,
as a solution,

836
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:10,430
but it has this negative side effects.
And then I think we should now think 

837
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,430
about,
well,

838
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,230
what technologies can we develop to 
manage that negative side effect?

839
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:16,890
And probably those have again,
a small negative side effect,

840
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:21,690
but you can think about it like a 
compounding sort of staircase of,

841
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,840
um,
of net positive technologies.

842
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,050
I think eventually that's how we can 
actually solve this problem.

843
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,600
So in this country there's a tremendous 
amount of recycling,

844
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,700
but how effective is that recycling?

845
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Yeah.
I think the amount of recycling is 

846
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,821
actually pretty low in the,
in the US compared to other countries 

847
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:43,480
that can do everything better over here.
Yeah.

848
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,380
I've noticed that.
What countries the best at it,

849
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:53,210
I think like Germany or Switzerland,
that this kind of country that really 

850
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:53,500
are.
And what do they do differently?

851
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,650
Um,
they just think they just put more money

852
00:40:56,651 --> 00:41:01,300
in it and I think most of the waste and 
the US is actually being landfilled.

853
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:07,250
So,
and what's used to be recycled actually 

854
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,210
was sent to China.
But now like I think this year or last 

855
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:10,210
year,
China said,

856
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:10,210
well,
no,

857
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,920
we don't want your waste anymore.
So,

858
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:16,921
uh,
so now I think there will be a lot of 

859
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:16,921
investments in new recycling facilities 
in the US.

860
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Now how does that get recycled save?
You use this water bottle and you empty 

861
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,090
and then you throw it into the recycle 
container.

862
00:41:24,091 --> 00:41:24,780
What happens?

863
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,020
Um,
so yeah,

864
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:30,680
I mean very much depends on the 
location,

865
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:33,410
but I'm to just use an example,
um,

866
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,870
of where I live in,
back in Holland.

867
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,430
Uh,
so they,

868
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,360
um,
they,

869
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:41,120
you actually,
they collect the plastic separately.

870
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:46,430
Then it goes to a facility where they 
sort the different kinds of plastic,

871
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,520
they get out all the contaminants and 
uh,

872
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,940
make that into two new pellets.
And the problem there is really the,

873
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,960
um,
the lack of demand for recycled plastic 

874
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,390
because I think a lot of companies that,
yeah,

875
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,090
that build products because basically 
virgin,

876
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:07,091
so new plastic is so cheap,
they'd rather just do what they're used 

877
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:12,161
to and I'm not,
they don't want to see any risks with 

878
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,630
their materials.
So they just choose for the safe option,

879
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:16,600
the,
the new kinds of plastics.

880
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:19,970
So I think if you want to do,
if you want to promote recycling,

881
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,360
uh,
I would actually say well promotes the 

882
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,910
use of recycled material because as long
as there's a demand then the price will 

883
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,250
go up and then automatically more 
recycling what would happen.

884
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,510
Yeah.
There's very little demand for recycled 

885
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:36,510
plastic.
Look,

886
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:36,820
it's not something that you hear about 
on a regular basis.

887
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:39,910
Like people that are clamoring to get 
only recycled plastic.

888
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,060
Yeah.
And I think that,

889
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,560
I think maybe that's,
um,

890
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:48,010
that could be another nice side effect 
of what we do because we can kind of 

891
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,020
make this sort of recycled plastic a bit
more sexy.

892
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,260
Perfect word.
Yeah.

893
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,110
Yeah.
I think that's exactly what it is.

894
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Have you extended this line of thinking 
to other environmental concerns like 

895
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:06,900
pollution in terms of chemical spills 
and pollution in the air and things 

896
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,510
along those lines?

897
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:13,050
Yeah.
I have quite a few more ideas I would 

898
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,650
say,
but yeah,

899
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:19,651
I would really,
really wouldn't be good for the ocean 

900
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:19,651
cleanup if I would get distracted.

901
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:24,290
Well,
I want you to farm those ideas to other 

902
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:24,580
people because I think guys like you are
insanely valuable.

903
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:29,610
Like that one person really did sort of 
germinate the seed and get this project 

904
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,500
moving.
It's very unusual.

905
00:43:32,501 --> 00:43:35,020
Outliers like yourself,
very humble guy.

906
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:36,490
I'm sure you don't think of yourself in 
an outlier,

907
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,730
but you most certainly are.
It's one of the most valuable things 

908
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,121
about civilizations,
the occasional person who steps out 

909
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:48,811
amongst the masses and does something 
pretty radical that almost everybody 

910
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:51,220
around them was aware it was an issue.
And that's what you're doing.

911
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Yeah.
I think there could be much more people 

912
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:56,780
that do things like that.

913
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Yeah,
I think I would think so.

914
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:01,721
But I don't see it.
That's what it's so fascinating about 

915
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:04,481
guys,
Iq is that this is not a very common 

916
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:06,170
thing to do,
but it's a very common problem.

917
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Yeah.
Well maybe that's because when you hear 

918
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,400
about people doing cool,
cool shit,

919
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,770
it's usually when they're already sort 
of doing those things and it's not.

920
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:19,960
When they kind of started thinking about
this,

921
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:22,480
so then I guess people can be 
intimidated.

922
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,720
Like how.
I don't know how to run a company of 100

923
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,920
people.
I didn't know how to uh,

924
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:33,330
how to get these things done.
But when I looked back at myself four or

925
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:38,361
five years ago,
I really didn't have a bloody clue what 

926
00:44:38,361 --> 00:44:40,050
I was doing.
What you were a baby.

927
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,250
Yeah,
exactly.

928
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,530
Five years ago or 18.
Yeah.

929
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,470
Yeah.
Um,

930
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,770
yeah.
That's a baby I wasn't even born yet.

931
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,050
No.
So,

932
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,790
so,
but that really doesn't matter.

933
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,540
I mean it sits about just getting 
started.

934
00:44:55,541 --> 00:45:00,541
Sure.
And being willing to learn and just 

935
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:04,670
being open to feedback and just trying 
many different things and seeing what 

936
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,971
works and what doesn't work,
especially at the beginning of done 

937
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,920
hundreds of things that didn't work the 
first time I tried a fundraising.

938
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,120
I send a cold email to 300 companies and
ask to ask for sponsorship.

939
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:18,930
And I think one replied and said,
this is a horrible idea.

940
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:20,840
You should go back to school.
Um,

941
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:22,830
so that wasn't heard.
That one.

942
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,270
Yeah.
Put that one on your wall.

943
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,640
I will do that.
It's a good idea.

944
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,170
Um,
so.

945
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:33,171
So that was very successful.
And then I tried crowdfunding and raise 

946
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:34,290
a few million bucks and allowed us to 
get started.

947
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,790
So isn't that amazing?
Yeah.

948
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,670
So it's just about sort of doing this 
trial and error.

949
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,610
So just like we developed a technology 
in a very iterative fashion.

950
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:44,530
It's also about developing yourself,
I think in a,

951
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:47,910
in an iterative fashion and sort of just
just get started.

952
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,060
Well,
what my point being is that when someone

953
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:55,020
like you does make something happen and 
once you get the ball rolling,

954
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,050
you can be a catalyst for so many other 
projects getting launched because it's 

955
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,780
attached to you like you're a person,
like you've got the fire,

956
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,190
okay,
you've got the fire,

957
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:08,430
so you put the fire over here.
Now this fire will start here.

958
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:10,650
Let me bring an end to this,
this project,

959
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,580
this can start and it seems to me that 
getting that fire,

960
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,640
getting that initial ember is one of the
most difficult aspects and creating any 

961
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,331
sort of technology in terms,
especially in terms of something so 

962
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:27,591
complex where you're extracting things 
that are potentially dangerous from the 

963
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:33,111
environment and creating a net positive 
effect and then using that plastic to 

964
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:34,680
recycle.
There's so much good Karma,

965
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,680
for lack of a better word,
attached to something like that.

966
00:46:37,681 --> 00:46:39,870
And,
and for a person like me,

967
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,770
when I hear that your sunglasses are 
made from the Pacific garbage patch,

968
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,000
I get excited.
I'm like,

969
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,220
Oh,
where can I buy these fucking sunglasses

970
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,120
next year?
Yeah,

971
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:50,020
well I'll buy him that,
but that,

972
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:55,070
that does get exciting to be bold.
So it seems to me that this excitement 

973
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:59,361
that you're bringing is contagious and 
you could potentially use it to spread 

974
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,920
other ideas that could also be 
environmentally positive.

975
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:09,970
Yeah.
Well I certainly hope that our people 

976
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:10,520
will think about sort of what kind of 
the ocean cleanup can I built,

977
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,590
which isn't cleaning plastic from the 
ocean.

978
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,800
So I hope people sort of already do 
that.

979
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,330
Um,
but yeah,

980
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,830
I mean it's a good,
good point.

981
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:22,730
I should sort of think about sort of 
what to do with these other ideas.

982
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:27,731
Like yeah,
a few of them are sort of thought about 

983
00:47:27,731 --> 00:47:28,790
that I kind of want to do myself 
eventually,

984
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:34,190
uh,
which would not be in the next few 

985
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:34,190
years,
but burning.

986
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:34,340
Yeah.
Do you have like a long

987
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,120
term plan for other stuff?
What are you going to do if you,

988
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,600
the oceans are all beautiful and blue,
you're like,

989
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,050
shit,

990
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,510
I mean what do I do?
And the goal is really to help ourselves

991
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:45,200
out of business.
Right?

992
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,260
So one day we hope we're done.
I don't want to be the garbage man of 

993
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,300
the ocean forever,
sort of not the best title anyway.

994
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,160
Um,
so,

995
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:00,310
so the,
I think we did target that we set for 

996
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,400
the ocean cleanup bulls to really get to
a 90 percent reduction by by 2040,

997
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:06,970
which is incredible,
which I think is achievable both on the 

998
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,610
influx side and the stock side.
Um,

999
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,080
but yeah,
so,

1000
00:48:12,081 --> 00:48:17,081
but I think that already before that,
I think maybe five years from now it 

1001
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:23,321
will just be sort of a steady operation.
And then for me it wouldn't be very 

1002
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:24,800
exciting anymore.
It's,

1003
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,880
I would be involved until really the 
end,

1004
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,760
but maybe,
yeah,

1005
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,070
maybe at some point in time I will be 
able to,

1006
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,310
um,
to sort of broaden my time over multiple

1007
00:48:37,311 --> 00:48:37,670
project.

1008
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,750
But that's,
yeah,

1009
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,630
that's at least years away,
um,

1010
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:46,180
because yeah,
of course there's still a lot of things 

1011
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,521
that need to happen.
We need to first prove the technology 

1012
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:49,220
first and foremost this year.
Uh,

1013
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:51,170
then we have to scale up,
um,

1014
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,080
you know,
raise hundreds of millions to build this

1015
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,790
entire fleet out.
Uh,

1016
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,560
then therefore more patches in the 
world.

1017
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:03,370
We need to make it into a self 
sustainable business and then we also 

1018
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:03,980
need to think about what can we do on 
the source side.

1019
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:09,430
So,
so there's quite a few pieces of the 

1020
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,890
puzzle is still there to be a to be 
found and put together.

1021
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,600
Um,
yeah.

1022
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:14,270
So I won't be bored for the next few 
years for sure.

1023
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:19,330
You certainly won't be one of the 
reasons why I'm asking this about you 

1024
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:24,190
and what your ideas are with cleaning up
other problems in the world as because 

1025
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,460
there's millions of people listening to 
this and there might be another boy in 

1026
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,360
out there who's a young kid who says,
well,

1027
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,290
why don't we do this or how come this 
hasn't been done or why,

1028
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,960
why hasn't someone tried this?
And next thing you know,

1029
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:44,590
someone who's figuring out how to 
extract heavy metals out of the bottom 

1030
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:44,590
of the ocean.
Sure,

1031
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,030
sure.
I think the thing that will be will be 

1032
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,350
great and yeah,
I'd definitely welcome people to sort of

1033
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:54,130
just to start and um,
yeah.

1034
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,510
What kind of other thoughts?
Well,

1035
00:49:55,511 --> 00:50:00,511
I think another thing that's important 
then when people try and solve problems 

1036
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:04,000
is that they actually think about how to
solve the problem.

1037
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,850
I think there's a lot of people that are
very,

1038
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:08,010
um,
yeah,

1039
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:11,020
very well meaning and they want to get 
involved.

1040
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:16,021
But then what happens is that they sort 
of think about it so at least I can kind

1041
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:19,180
of make a dent and then hopefully that 
dense sort of grows.

1042
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,480
But I think what's,
what a lot of people forget to do is 

1043
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,020
that when they sort of start tackling a 
problem,

1044
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:31,021
they forget,
sort of look at the whole problem with 

1045
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:33,611
first and see what sort of,
what's required to actually solve the 

1046
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:33,611
whole problem.

1047
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:36,500
And then I'm sort of reason your way 
back to,

1048
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:41,501
well,
what's the first step that I need to 

1049
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:41,870
take?
Because if you don't do that well then I

1050
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:46,871
think it will be very hard to kind of 
get the scale you need to actually sort 

1051
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:47,570
of solve,
solve the problem.

1052
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,620
Um,
so,

1053
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:49,460
and it's,
yeah,

1054
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,460
I can imagine,
can be quite intimidating to think about

1055
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:53,930
that.
But um,

1056
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:59,050
yeah,
I think that would get us to much more 

1057
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,460
sort of effective solutions to sort of 
this sort of top down problem solving as

1058
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:05,990
I would call it instead of sort of 
bottom up some problem solving.

1059
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:11,560
So when have you talked to anybody that 
also had an idea of how to clean up the 

1060
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:13,880
Pacific garbage patch?

1061
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:19,060
Now I've read about other proposals from
the past for sure.

1062
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,980
But no one is really actively pursued 
anything.

1063
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,190
Um,
so I didn't know.

1064
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,300
But the thing is of course all those 
other ideas were based on sort of boats 

1065
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,730
and nets that would go fishing plastic 
taking 79,000

1066
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,900
years for,
for just one.

1067
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:34,120
Pat.

1068
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,180
She,
there was one that I saw that looked 

1069
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,071
like some gigantic floating thing.
It looked like a spaceship and he was 

1070
00:51:41,071 --> 00:51:44,320
kinda like moving across the surface,
sort of skimming it.

1071
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,190
Is that one of those

1072
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:51,330
see actually the,
some artist's impression of one of our 

1073
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,720
earlier concept.
I think that's probably what it was.

1074
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,670
That was.
Yeah,

1075
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,490
that was ours.

1076
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,400
What other,
I mean,

1077
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:03,401
if you don't mind talking about them and
what other ideas have you had in terms 

1078
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:03,401
of like cleaning things up?

1079
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,590
Yeah,
I'm kind of hesitant to joke about them,

1080
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:11,400
but I mean there's plenty of other 
problems out there.

1081
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:14,670
So if you just think about sort of what 
are their big problems are out there.

1082
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,150
How about water pollution?
Um,

1083
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:22,440
yeah,
I usually what I do is like she,

1084
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:27,650
I try and actively forced these ideas 
out of my head just because sort of once

1085
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:31,350
you have an idea it sort of starts to 
grow and then sometimes you know,

1086
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,370
with,
with any project you're doing there,

1087
00:52:33,371 --> 00:52:38,371
there are these weeks that things don't 
go very well and sort of everything 

1088
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:40,190
seems to be against you.
And in those weeks though,

1089
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:45,250
it's very tempting to start thinking 
about well at this other idea and you 

1090
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:49,671
know,
and sort of starts to grow and you 

1091
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:49,690
should be careful that it doesn't take 
over your entire month.

1092
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,260
So I don't know what you're saying too.

1093
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,860
Scattered and spread out.
Yeah.

1094
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:56,000
So I think it's of paramount importance 
for the,

1095
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,150
this,
for the Azure team to happen is that I 

1096
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,000
stay 100 percent focused on what we do 
if there's one mission rid the oceans of

1097
00:53:03,001 --> 00:53:08,001
plastic and that's what we're doing.
So what I usually do is I sort of write 

1098
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:12,861
them down in my notebook and keep it 
next to my bed and that's where it stays

1099
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:18,921
until maybe a few years from now.
So probably when you were to ask me 

1100
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,750
what's the top three ideas,
other ideas that you have,

1101
00:53:21,751 --> 00:53:26,751
I wouldn't be able to,
wouldn't even be able to say them 

1102
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:30,711
because yeah,
they're sort of out of my hand and then 

1103
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:30,711
I really tried to keep it there.
Um,

1104
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:31,770
but,
um,

1105
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,000
I mean,
what's,

1106
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,880
what I can say is that they're all sort 
of technology based.

1107
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:38,280
So they're all things that are possible 
now,

1108
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:43,281
but I want to make possible in the 
future and there are sort of all 

1109
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,040
connected in terms of negative side 
effects of,

1110
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,440
yeah,
of civilization.

1111
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,440
And trying to sort of make sure that 
that doesn't backfire to us.

1112
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,360
What I always like to do is I try to 
think like if we sort of try to imagine 

1113
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:02,910
a future in 10,000
years from now,

1114
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,440
um,
how do we make sure that civilization is

1115
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:09,720
there,
but,

1116
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,860
you know,
zooming out,

1117
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,170
humanity's still there as zooming 
further out,

1118
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:18,171
just general life can,
can prosper and yeah,

1119
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,240
when I look at if I tried to extrapolate
the current situation to the next 10,000

1120
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:27,060
years,
I don't think we're at that point yet,

1121
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,100
but I think it's um,
yeah,

1122
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,860
it's a challenge that we'll have to sue 
so.

1123
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:36,420
Well,
it's certainly a challenge that we're 

1124
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,621
going to have to solve and challenge 
that I would hope more people like you 

1125
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:42,520
tackle and start approaching these 
issues with the sort of 10,000

1126
00:54:42,521 --> 00:54:45,190
year mindset.
I'm a big one,

1127
00:54:45,191 --> 00:54:47,890
of course with the ocean is overfishing.

1128
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,890
Yeah,
for sure.

1129
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,300
Um,
yeah.

1130
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,200
I mean,
one thing say retinue of credit,

1131
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,840
of excitement and a lot of startups in 
the area of,

1132
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,840
of artificial meat,
right?

1133
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,700
Yeah.
Why not artificial fish,

1134
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,620
fish meat,
right?

1135
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,540
Because there seems to be this natural 
evolution from sort of wild hunting to 

1136
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:18,020
farming to sort of this more a lab grown
stuff that doesn't involve killing or a,

1137
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:25,581
all these resources being wasted and on 
land were kind of in Stage two now is 

1138
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,960
they're going to stage three protein 
next few decades.

1139
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,900
But if you look at phishing,
it's still just hunting,

1140
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:35,760
right?
So it's still just wildcard.

1141
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,600
Most,
most,

1142
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,170
most fish,

1143
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,320
there's some farm raised,
but it's also fun to be not as valuable 

1144
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:42,320
or as healthy.

1145
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,140
Yeah.
And I think they also use a lot of wild 

1146
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,730
caught fish as a feedstock for these 
farmed fish.

1147
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:51,260
So that's kind of odd.
But yeah,

1148
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,420
but that seems to be served as mentor 
evolution.

1149
00:55:53,421 --> 00:55:57,590
So I think that would be a way to,
to kind of solve that.

1150
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,600
Um,
and m.

1151
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,340
But isn't there a potential.
I mean,

1152
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:04,760
if we're looking at this in terms of 
longterm of what we've done with plastic

1153
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:08,600
and the downside,
there's potential downsides to even this

1154
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:13,601
lab grown stuff.
Like we don't know really the health 

1155
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:16,940
consequences of consuming it yet.
We don't know what the side effects are.

1156
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:21,260
We don't know what sort of byproducts 
are created in manufacturing this stuff.

1157
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,590
Yeah.
Um,

1158
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,370
possibly and we need to

1159
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,560
look carefully at this.
Uh,

1160
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:33,150
but I think a decent paper does have a 
lot of potential of being able to do 

1161
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:33,150
more with less.

1162
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,010
Yeah.
I'm going to wait for awhile.

1163
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,480
Yeah.
I just want,

1164
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,890
I just,
I don't know,

1165
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,570
it just seems to me like,
boy,

1166
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:42,740
this could be one of those early adopter
things.

1167
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,290
It could be A.

1168
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:44,930
Yeah,
disaster.

1169
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,900
Yeah.
Well,

1170
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,470
yeah,
yeah,

1171
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,450
I show that dude.
Good testing there.

1172
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,000
I'm sure they do too.
I mean,

1173
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,410
I'm,
I'm sure I'm just ignorant,

1174
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,320
but I'm still paranoid.
I would just go,

1175
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:58,000
what are you doing?
What's going on?

1176
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,010
How'd you make that?
You made it out in the lab.

1177
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:01,180
Okay,
good luck eaten it.

1178
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,350
I'll be over here.

1179
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,840
I mean,
it's funny how thinks sort of,

1180
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,760
um,
it's,

1181
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:12,810
something's just take a lot of time to 
sort of get used to another thing sort 

1182
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:12,810
of once it's,
it's there.

1183
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:16,190
You kind of used to it in a second.
The example,

1184
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:19,250
like earlier this week I was driving a,
um,

1185
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,610
a,
a tesla on,

1186
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,700
on autopilot.
And as driving it for five minutes and 

1187
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,140
then already you're kind of doing your 
emails and then when you take it off,

1188
00:57:31,141 --> 00:57:35,700
it just feels like you're back in the 
stone ages when you're just kind of have

1189
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:37,350
to drive this yourself.
It's so weird.

1190
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:38,180
So,
so you,

1191
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:38,900
you do your

1192
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
email while you're driving,
you're not even paying attention to the 

1193
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,670
machine and make sure that it doesn't 
hit some homeless lady who steps out off

1194
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:49,671
the median,
like say this did happen over a car.

1195
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:58,110
Yeah,
I mean I think this things like this 

1196
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,510
will come up more rapidly than people 
think and I think people will be very,

1197
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,310
very quickly that we'll use to it.

1198
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,340
But aren't you?
You're supposed to like look at the 

1199
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,340
road.
Right?

1200
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,340
And that's supposed to be staring down 
at your laptop.

1201
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,530
Yeah.
Okay.

1202
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:12,310
I just erase everything I said for the 
past minute or two.

1203
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:17,370
Have you ever seen the video of the guy 
is falling asleep and San Francisco 

1204
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,131
traffic now he's completely asleep.
He's behind the wheel that tesla like 

1205
00:58:20,131 --> 00:58:23,450
this and the car's slowing and going 
with the pace of traffic.

1206
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,730
It's really fascinating because this 
happened so quickly.

1207
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,510
I remember a buddy of mine got a tesla a
couple years ago and he's like,

1208
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:36,511
dude,
I can let my hands off the wheel on the 

1209
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:36,511
highway.
I'm like,

1210
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:36,511
really?
Like,

1211
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:39,780
that's happening already,
but it's not just happening like people 

1212
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,180
plug into their navigate here.
This guy look at him.

1213
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,600
This guy is stone dead asleep in his 
tesla in bumper to bumper San Francisco 

1214
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:50,960
traffic and the car is performing 
flawlessly and hurt their business.

1215
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,900
This Dutch guy actually just went to the
back office,

1216
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:57,340
like on the back seat and started 
changing his clothes and.

1217
00:58:57,341 --> 00:58:58,300
Oh God.
Yeah,

1218
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:03,301
and then apparently that they now 
included the safety feature that you 

1219
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:03,470
kind of have to touch the wheel every 
minute of it.

1220
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,290
Oh,
that's a new thing.

1221
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,820
Yeah.
BMW,

1222
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:08,410
I believe,
has a similar system,

1223
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,390
but you have to have your hand on the 
wheel at all times.

1224
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,130
Yeah.
It's pretty better until it's flawless.

1225
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,310
It's.
Yeah.

1226
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,400
Yeah.
I would imagine.

1227
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,970
Yeah.
People probably do and all kinds of 

1228
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:20,970
freaky shit in their cars while this 
thing is on autopilot,

1229
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:21,170
it's really don't.
Yeah.

1230
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,660
Yeah.
It's quite amazing how,

1231
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:28,690
I mean there's.
You're just about to show a video of 

1232
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,970
Tesla autopilot crash compilations,
saving people from crashes is what it's.

1233
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,660
Oh yeah.
Oh,

1234
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:37,661
I'm sure it does.
What's unbelievable is how few crashes 

1235
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,590
there are and they said they'd been two 
fatalities so far.

1236
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,620
Okay.
How many fatalities per capita versus 

1237
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,900
non autopilot cars?
I mean,

1238
00:59:46,901 --> 00:59:48,350
I would imagine it's far less.

1239
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,410
Yeah.
Obviously these cars are also just safer

1240
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:56,411
in general,
so they're not much safer than a 19 

1241
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:59,660
nineties Toyota Corolla or something.
So in terms of the way the construction.

1242
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,510
Yeah,
just safer when they crashed,

1243
01:00:01,511 --> 01:00:04,610
so I didn't know how they compared the 
sisters statistics,

1244
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,840
but yeah,
I,

1245
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,080
I'm,
I'm very impressed too.

1246
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,340
It was fun trying it out.

1247
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:12,780
Yeah,
I'm impressed and I'm very hopeful.

1248
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:17,810
The only,
my only concern I had my friend Matt 

1249
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,360
Farah was on last week and he's a car 
expert and they've actually started an 

1250
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,140
organization to save human driving 
there.

1251
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,720
They're literally going to be like 
lobbyists to,

1252
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,280
to stop.
It doesn't get Ben.

1253
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:30,060
Yeah.
Well,

1254
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:35,061
that's the concern is that one day 
they're going to say you cannot drive 

1255
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:36,300
your own car,
and they're really worried that.

1256
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,130
What was the name of his organization?
Do you remember?

1257
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,850
Okay.
So,

1258
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,450
but the,
the,

1259
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,040
you know,
they're very serious.

1260
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:49,041
He's like,
it's going to happen quicker than you 

1261
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:49,041
think you're going.
It's going to be very difficult to drive

1262
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,000
your own car and then it's going to be 
illegal.

1263
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:56,140
Yeah.
Maybe they should keep areas like the 

1264
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:56,140
highway one or anything like that.

1265
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,100
Just something,
some freaky road or people can get 

1266
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:00,100
crazy.
Look,

1267
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:00,100
man,
I'm steering.

1268
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,810
I'm hitting my own brakes.
Yeah.

1269
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:03,290
Yeah.
I mean,

1270
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,880
again,
these are things that it's most likely 

1271
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:08,880
inevitable.
I mean,

1272
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,520
this,
this technology,

1273
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:11,410
the way it's progressing,
it's going to be safer.

1274
01:01:11,411 --> 01:01:13,600
It's going to be healthier,
lower emissions.

1275
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:18,601
All these variables that are going to 
come into play where people are gonna 

1276
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:19,030
say no,
there's just the benefit of driving your

1277
01:01:19,031 --> 01:01:21,340
own car is not worth the detriment to 
society.

1278
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:23,920
Yeah.
And next to that,

1279
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:28,970
uh,
just if you think about the normal rate 

1280
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:31,300
of converting the entire car fleet to 
electric,

1281
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:36,301
it would be around 20 years because 
that's sort of how long cars last and 

1282
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:40,520
you only produce a few hundred million 
cars a year and there's billions of 

1283
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:40,520
cars.
So,

1284
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:40,520
um,
so,

1285
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,910
you know,
if you don't want that to take 20 years,

1286
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:47,940
well I think autonomy than really has to
come into play because if you have 

1287
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,540
autonomous cars,
you need much less cars out there than 

1288
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,651
you would if you would have to drive 
themselves because obviously cars are 

1289
01:01:55,651 --> 01:01:57,130
just driving maybe three percent of 
their time,

1290
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:03,020
their time,
they're just being parked so they can 

1291
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,300
drive themselves.
I think the utilization of the number of

1292
01:02:04,301 --> 01:02:06,800
cars will be much higher.
And um,

1293
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:10,450
I think that whole transition to 
electric cars would happen much faster.

1294
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,800
It's a human driving or association,
a Human Driving Association is what it 

1295
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,330
is here.
Pull it,

1296
01:02:16,331 --> 01:02:17,340
pull it back up again so you can.

1297
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:17,760
Got It.

1298
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,990
Yeah.
The war on driving is here.

1299
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,170
A little paranoid.
They're a little paranoid,

1300
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:28,980
but you gotta remember Matt Farah is a,
an automotive journalist,

1301
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:33,981
so his livelihood depends on talking 
about cars and he's a real legitimate 

1302
01:02:33,981 --> 01:02:36,030
car.
What does this wrong answer?

1303
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,430
What does that pick?
The electric car.

1304
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,990
Oh,
you clicked.

1305
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:42,190
It says wrong answer.
You go there.

1306
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,620
It takes you to their shop.
Well,

1307
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,530
why is this a shame?
Oh,

1308
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,190
I get it.
That's just a joke.

1309
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:51,510
Why would it be the wrong answer?
It's just an an answer.

1310
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:54,930
Do you drive?
Do you drive an electric car?

1311
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:55,920
A regular car?
Actually,

1312
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:57,780
I don't have a car.
You don't know.

1313
01:02:57,781 --> 01:02:59,900
And why don't you ever read any cars?
You just have a.

1314
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,730
have a bike,
but it's fucking freezing there.

1315
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,910
Yeah,
the coat drive.

1316
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:08,890
Wow.
Okay.

1317
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:09,840
Hardcore.
Listen,

1318
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:12,420
I'm a big fan of Holland because a 
kickbox.

1319
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,480
So you guys have some of the greatest 
kickboxers of all times came from this 

1320
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,570
one small place.
It's very unusual.

1321
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:20,580
No.
Why is that?

1322
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,920
I have no idea.
Yeah.

1323
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:28,130
We just have to punch people.
I guess when you did cut you off at the 

1324
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:29,460
Carthage.
Oh,

1325
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:32,100
is that what it is?
But Holland is a very unique place,

1326
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:33,300
isn't it?
I mean it's a,

1327
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:37,290
it's a very unusual country.
I mean,

1328
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,050
yeah,
sometimes people wonder why do you think

1329
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:45,420
this is based on Hollander is there came
out of Holland and for us it makes a lot

1330
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,510
of sense and that we live below sea 
level.

1331
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:53,511
So we're like,
we have pray per capita the highest 

1332
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:56,010
number of hydraulic engineers and 
maritime engineers' blessing.

1333
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:01,190
So it's just very good access to human 
capital and um,

1334
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:03,690
yeah,
so,

1335
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,900
so pretty makes sense for us to be there
as an option for engineering companies 

1336
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,030
that support us and are involved with us
contractors.

1337
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:13,920
Uh,
so.

1338
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:18,770
So for us it's not pretty very strange,
but I don't know about the other things.

1339
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:21,840
There's quite a lot of innovation coming
from such a small country.

1340
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,510
Yeah,
a lot of innovation and really unique,

1341
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:29,511
intelligent people.
I've met a lot of people from Holland 

1342
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:29,590
and they just really fascinating people.
Wim Hof.

1343
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:30,480
Wim.
Yeah.

1344
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:33,320
I've never met him,
but fucking guys the best.

1345
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,820
And so lovely.
He's just such an amazing person.

1346
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:36,710
Every time you're around them you're 
like,

1347
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,150
feel better.
Like somebody like some coffee.

1348
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,500
Oh,
I know.

1349
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:44,010
He's just,
he's very contagious and I mean I have,

1350
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,650
I have quite a few friends from Holland.
You could check your watch.

1351
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:47,560
You got to take off soon.
Right.

1352
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,890
So fuck you.
Okay.

1353
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,580
Um,
it's just,

1354
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:53,220
uh,
I am fascinated how,

1355
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:59,420
how variable people are and how these 
cultures like Holland sort of arise and 

1356
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,570
I just find so many people from Holland 
to be.

1357
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,030
I'm waiting to meet assholes from 
Holland.

1358
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:08,340
I'm sure you must have them,
but they do it this,

1359
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:13,710
they take from that with the people that
I've met from Holland or friendly and 

1360
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,060
happy.
It's a very unusual place.

1361
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,990
Yeah,
no,

1362
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,010
sure.
Yeah,

1363
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:18,570
I,
I mean,

1364
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:21,520
I,
I kind of feel the same way about the US

1365
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:22,980
west coast as well.
Um,

1366
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,580
it's just,
um,

1367
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:27,790
yeah,
I mean I'd definitely be able to live in

1368
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,730
a place like San Francisco maybe just 
because of the.

1369
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,240
Yeah,
the high priest,

1370
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:37,620
the high percentage of engineers and 
entrepreneurs that kind of makes me feel

1371
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:38,660
at home.
But,

1372
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:39,760
uh,
no,

1373
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:41,980
but I mean us in general,
I feel like,

1374
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:42,960
um,
yeah,

1375
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,530
the people are very friendly.

1376
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,630
I can tell you some,
some spots that suck.

1377
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:47,950
Okay.
There's a few spots.

1378
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:49,540
It's like,
yeah,

1379
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:54,541
you're in a good spot right here and San
Francisco is a fantastic spot in terms 

1380
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:58,591
of innovation,
how well has this been received in,

1381
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,120
in America and particularly in 
California.

1382
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:04,120
I mean obviously you're here to do some 
business and talk to some people.

1383
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:09,420
Is this something that people are very 
excited about and you feel like there's 

1384
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:09,420
a lot of momentum behind it?

1385
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,690
Actually us,
the,

1386
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:16,180
the number one group of supporters for 
us because we know we fucked up a lot 

1387
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,060
with the ocean and it's right there.
Maybe that's your target,

1388
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,460
but no,
just I think people are very um,

1389
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:24,850
yeah,
very supportive.

1390
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:27,580
But maybe it's also because the 
geography of the patch,

1391
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:31,630
it's right between two US states like 
Canada but different.

1392
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,640
Um,
so yeah,

1393
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:36,310
so it's um,
yeah,

1394
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:38,380
I think we've received a lot of support 
from the US.

1395
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:43,510
Um,
I think that our biggest support group 

1396
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:46,120
is from here and like everyone I talk to
here they really want to get into.

1397
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,810
So yeah,
I think the,

1398
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:51,700
um,
yeah,

1399
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:53,620
we're kind of lucky that it's next to 
the US.

1400
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,510
Yes.
So you've raised all this money,

1401
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,150
is this going to be a profitable 
business?

1402
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,610
Actually,
so we're a non for profit entity,

1403
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,640
so a,
we're not even allowed to make profit,

1404
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,370
but eventually the idea is that this 
sort of,

1405
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:12,371
this plastic business would be sort of a
separate thing and that would then 

1406
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:17,210
create the funding for the cleanup.
So everything would be reinvested in the

1407
01:07:17,211 --> 01:07:17,480
cleanup.

1408
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:18,750
Oh,
that's fantastic.

1409
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:21,300
So do you have a name for the plastic 
business?

1410
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:22,610
Uh,
no.

1411
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:27,810
Uh,
right now it's just under the ocean 

1412
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:27,810
cleanup still we'll,
we'll,

1413
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:27,810
we're actually thinking about some kind 
of brand name,

1414
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,390
but it's the next year.

1415
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,950
Yeah,
please let me know.

1416
01:07:30,951 --> 01:07:32,450
I mean we'll promote the hell out of 
that.

1417
01:07:32,451 --> 01:07:37,451
I think that's a fantastic idea.
And I'll try to buy as many things out 

1418
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:38,300
of ocean plastic as they can sell deal,
I think.

1419
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:43,530
Yeah,
I mean think the more things you can 

1420
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:43,530
buy,
maybe plastic sale.

1421
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,470
Get this guy,
you know that phone.

1422
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:49,471
Where are you buddy that makes these,
it's a guy carves all these himself and 

1423
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:54,560
then makes these molds and then hand 
paints all of these.

1424
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:55,760
Wow.
Yeah.

1425
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:57,670
He's a little wizard.
I don't know.

1426
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,270
He's just,
he's a wizard.

1427
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:04,590
He's a big wizard.
If it's is actual size or me now I'm a 

1428
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:05,210
little taller than me,
but uh,

1429
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,130
my head's not that big either,
but yeah,

1430
01:08:07,131 --> 01:08:12,131
these things are uh,
I mean to have a line made out of 

1431
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:13,130
completely out of ocean plastic would be
amazing.

1432
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,930
Maybe he'll do a Boyan version.

1433
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,380
That'd be creepy.
Creepy,

1434
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,430
creepy looking at me over there.
Yeah,

1435
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,750
yeah,
yeah.

1436
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:24,440
That's a weird phase two.
But um,

1437
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,990
yeah,
I mean there's,

1438
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:31,020
there's really the sky's the limit in 
terms of applications of your plastic 

1439
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:31,070
and uh,
and again,

1440
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,380
I fist think it'd be so attractive to 
people.

1441
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,060
I mean,
especially out here,

1442
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:40,070
California,
at least posing as being environmentally

1443
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:45,071
conscious.
There's a lot of environmentally 

1444
01:08:45,071 --> 01:08:45,071
conscious posers out here for sure.
I mean,

1445
01:08:45,071 --> 01:08:47,210
they would like to just be able to say 
that and they're like,

1446
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:52,211
oh,
my dog's leash is made out of 

1447
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:52,211
environmentally conscious class that we 
put in the ocean.

1448
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,890
I was actually a part of the expedition.
I was there.

1449
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,480
That was a good idea.
Yeah,

1450
01:08:56,481 --> 01:09:01,481
I mean really just,
I just think the sky's the limit in 

1451
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:04,640
terms of just the attractiveness of that
kind of plastic.

1452
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,600
Yeah.
And on one hand at the problem that 

1453
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,211
everything is made out of plastic,
but it does give a huge potential for 

1454
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:14,110
alternative materials.
Like there's ocean plus.

1455
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:19,260
Yeah.
What do you feel you're going to be 

1456
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,631
doing when this is done?
Like say if you get to this point where 

1457
01:09:21,631 --> 01:09:22,630
most of the stuff's pulled out of the 
ocean and what do you,

1458
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:23,860
what,
what do you plan for the future?

1459
01:09:23,861 --> 01:09:25,060
You're 23 years old.
I mean,

1460
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:26,800
you can basically do anything you want.

1461
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,090
Sure.
Um,

1462
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:33,250
maybe go on a holiday for a month and.
Yeah.

1463
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:36,040
And then I'll probably just be working 
on the next one.

1464
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:42,320
I think this is what I love doing and 
yeah,

1465
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:47,370
I hope I'll get the opportunity to work 
on many more problems like this in the 

1466
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:47,370
future.

1467
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,440
So you feel like you will be a problem 
solver,

1468
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:50,400
like that's your thing

1469
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,000
that be.
I should put that on my business card,

1470
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,280
problem solver.
Why not?

1471
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:57,090
Yeah,
I mean that's essentially what you are,

1472
01:09:57,091 --> 01:09:57,390
right?

1473
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:02,900
I think there's just nothing more fun 
than sort of solving a problem as.

1474
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:06,110
And when you think about project like 
the ocean cleanup,

1475
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:10,400
you're sure you're solving the southern 
part of a massive problem,

1476
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:15,401
but just the whole road to it.
It's just like one little problem after 

1477
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:20,711
another little problem and yeah,
I just think it's just very sort of 

1478
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:26,531
intellectual intellectually satisfying 
to be sort of confronted with this new 

1479
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:30,830
weird problem and then you can have to 
sort of think how to solve them.

1480
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:32,480
And as you know,
as the CEO,

1481
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:37,481
you're sort of the accumulation zone,
the garbage patches it were for problems

1482
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:44,411
within your own organization.
So everything that other people cannot 

1483
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:44,720
solve sort of end up with with you.
Um,

1484
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,540
and yeah,
kind of,

1485
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,390
I kinda like that.
It's a,

1486
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:51,980
it's this fun thinking about things.
So for example,

1487
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:55,580
just this week we had a,
like a,

1488
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:59,510
I think it was last week,
so on Monday that was,

1489
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:04,130
so we have this assembly yard and there 
was a fence that was seven meters.

1490
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:08,540
I'm too far to the left and there was 
just this,

1491
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:10,610
uh,
this email from the,

1492
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,510
from the government saying,
well,

1493
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:14,680
if you don't move it within 10 days you 
have to stop your operation and I go,

1494
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,860
Shit.
Um,

1495
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,890
but yeah,
I mean,

1496
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:19,680
so this little problem and you just have
to do a few calls and think about,

1497
01:11:19,681 --> 01:11:24,681
well,
how can we now arrange the assembly 

1498
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:25,970
yards in a way that it's still big 
enough so we can assemble this 2000 feet

1499
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,160
thing.
Um,

1500
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:31,860
and then the next day turned out there 
was sort of a slight misalignment of one

1501
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:36,390
of the connections strips on one of the 
flotation elements of the system.

1502
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,810
And you Kinda have to figure out how can
we still attach it while I'm sort of 

1503
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:44,460
working with this and you know,
sort sort of just details,

1504
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:47,510
but there are details on a daily basis 
and yeah,

1505
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:52,580
that kind of what makes it fun for me,
if it would all go fall asleep would be 

1506
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:52,710
pretty boring.

1507
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,690
Well that's what's fascinating about a 
guy like you,

1508
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:59,691
is that your personality perfectly 
aligns with this kind of problem.

1509
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,940
I mean,
and that's a very unusual thing.

1510
01:12:02,941 --> 01:12:05,280
Did you,
were you a puzzle solver when you were a

1511
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:07,050
kid?
Were you into like mysteries?

1512
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:07,650
Like what is.

1513
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,380
I'm not really,
they're just billing thing.

1514
01:12:10,381 --> 01:12:13,050
So actually,
so one of the things that I did it funny

1515
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:17,250
anecdote is when it was,
think it was about 13 years old,

1516
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:22,310
I had this idea of doing,
getting into the Guinness Book of 

1517
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:28,190
Records with launching a model rocket.
So it was already into those kind of 

1518
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:31,350
things and build them myself and they 
shoot up like 300 feet in the sky.

1519
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,010
Um,
and what that then do,

1520
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:39,011
I was sort of organized this whole thing
with like there was media and we had 

1521
01:12:39,011 --> 01:12:43,611
sponsors and we at the university 
collaborating and we just had the sports

1522
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:46,830
field with 300 people who were all at 
the same time.

1523
01:12:46,831 --> 01:12:51,750
They would all launch the rocket and 
actually I think we launched like 213 of

1524
01:12:51,751 --> 01:12:54,490
them at the same time and actually got 
the Guinness Book of Records.

1525
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,060
So I always had my projects,
let's put it that way.

1526
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:02,830
Have you thought about potentially 
working with companies that produce 

1527
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:09,370
environmental waste,
like maybe a company brings you on as a 

1528
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:14,351
problem solver for some sort of an issue
that they have a residual issue of 

1529
01:13:14,351 --> 01:13:14,840
something that they produce?

1530
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,980
Um,
yeah,

1531
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:22,010
I mean I don't think it will be very 
interesting to be a consultant or 

1532
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:22,400
anything,
but um,

1533
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:28,190
yeah,
I mean definitely sort of after this I 

1534
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,531
want to do sort of solve more work on 
more bake challenges.

1535
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,040
Yeah,
like oil spills,

1536
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,050
things along those lines.
Um,

1537
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,030
yeah.
I mean you can keep guessing,

1538
01:13:37,031 --> 01:13:41,360
but yeah,
you'll see,

1539
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,310
you'll see.
I'm sure.

1540
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,470
I'm sure we will see.
Well listen man,

1541
01:13:44,471 --> 01:13:49,471
I'm so happy that you exist.
I'm so happy that there's someone out 

1542
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:51,120
there that's actually doing something 
about this and uh,

1543
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,000
I've,
I've seen,

1544
01:13:52,001 --> 01:13:53,860
like I said,
I've seen many of your talks.

1545
01:13:53,861 --> 01:13:58,861
I think it's a comprehensive approach.
I think it's amazing and I really hope 

1546
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:00,490
that something comes out of this.
It really works well.

1547
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,750
Thanks so much.
Thank you.

1548
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:06,751
My pleasure.
And thanks for doing this please and 

1549
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:06,751

get to your website.

1550
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:08,930
Yeah.

1553
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,670
