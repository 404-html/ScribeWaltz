1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,410
Straightening because nothing works
properly.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,400
There are no good mobile phones.
One,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,330
boom miles only been here for five
minutes.

4
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:09,600
We've already discussed cocaine,
radical feminism,

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,990
a radical progressive's that want to
take over the world.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,940
Uh,
prescription drugs,

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,850
tight shirts.
We've gone the full gamut.

8
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,110
We have,
we really have,

9
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,160
and it's,
it's fresh.

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,580
It's young and fresh.
We've already gone the full gamut.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,440
Um,
I found out about you,

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,660
uh,
I guess it was so many,

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,070
just,
I,

14
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,020
I get a lot of interesting stuff tweeted
at me and,

15
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,450
uh,
I read one of your Breitbart pieces and

16
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,280
I was like,
check this motherfucker out.

17
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,510
And then I found out that you're gay and
you're,

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,420
you're a part of this gamer gate,
but you're in the game.

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,660
You're on this,
you were on the side of the people that

20
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,440
were,
uh,

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,440
not the ultra progressive's like,
and then you were in these debates

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,440
against these radical feminism chicks
and shutting them down.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,910
And I was like,
you were very kind about me.

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,620
Play some video.
Look at this motherfucker.

25
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:02,310
You're a unicorn.
Like they don't like people like you.

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,430
I'm not supposed to exist into the
progressive rules of the universe.

27
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,570
I should not be.
Yeah,

28
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:08,790
you should.
You're not supposed to be like fairly

29
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:13,791
buttoned down and conservative and,
and fare well also factually correct.

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,500
Like all the stuff that you would,
the thing that I'd seen,

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,530
you've gotten in his argument about why
certain women gravitate towards certain

32
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:26,580
jobs and men gravitate towards jobs and
this idea that,

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,170
that a lot of this is just cultural.
A lot of this is something that we're

34
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,750
pushing upon young men and young women
and you were like,

35
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,950
well,
this isn't the case at all.

36
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,370
They're just hilarious to watch someone
confronted by.

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
Like they expect that to come from a me.
They expected to come from some

38
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,430
[inaudible] like I ought to be
supporting the exact and on paper like

39
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,811
paper,
I should,

40
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,370
you know what I mean?
I'm a metropolitan.

41
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,140
Yeah.

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,310
I'm,
since I would be a liberal,

43
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,560
I'm a homosexual.
I listen.

44
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,000
I'd like pop culture,
you know,

45
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,130
all of those things.
I shouldn't really exist,

46
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,120
but I do

47
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,600
for that one 10th of your tweets are
about how fabulous your hair is.

48
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,281
Yeah.
So black,

49
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,114
Greek,
you know,

50
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,100
I of those things,
any of those subjects,

51
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:11,630
you know,
his hair or you know,

52
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,670
the men that I'm into,
it's very,

53
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,890
very difficult for them to beat me for
one simple reason,

54
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,290
which is they've never been questioned.
I've never been called in any of this

55
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,130
stuff by anybody's serious or anybody
who's a,

56
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,320
who doesn't conform to the progressive
rules if identity politics.

57
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,160
So when they come from me,
they usual the usual response from a

58
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:32,960
feminist to anybody bringing facts or
accountants as serious counter argument

59
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:36,080
is simply to dismiss them as a sexist or
a bigot or a misogynist.

60
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,420
It's really tough to make the allegation
against me.

61
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,250
I love women.
All my friends are women.

62
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,980
I don't have any,
I don't have a dog in the fight sexually

63
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,440
speaking.
I don't care if I don't,

64
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,190
I don't want to bang them,
whatever size they are,

65
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:47,840
however they behave.
So they really don't,

66
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,580
they don't have that over me.
It's very,

67
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:52,880
very difficult to come up against the
guy that you cannot make a convincing

68
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,741
argument,
uh,

69
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,940
of bigotry again.
So you have to argue on the facts.

70
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:58,910
And of course the facts are on my side.
Well that's what the deal is.

71
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:00,310
They dismiss

72
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,310
you instantaneously because of what you
represent because what you represented

73
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,520
like,
well look,

74
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,060
we got the dirt on him.
He's,

75
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,840
he's,
he's gay and he's fabulous shit,

76
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,290
what are we going to do?

77
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,110
But once you start,
once you start to hit their radar,

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,020
you note that you get calls from friends
who say said this,

79
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,000
this person I emailed me trying to check
you out.

80
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,560
This happened to me about a year ago.
So I sort of hit an a journalist for 10

81
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,550
years.
What are some good staff?

82
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,990
Brooklyn's a big stories,
but I never really,

83
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,360
I never really kind of crossed over into
entertainment into the mainstream and

84
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,510
just started to happen about year ago
and I started to get emails from friends

85
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,470
and they were saying,
I'm so what?

86
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,880
What's going on here?
People keep emailing me,

87
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:41,440
asking me about you like trying to ask
like in back in 2011 did he really do

88
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:44,110
this?
And what I've realized is when they,

89
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,710
when they recognize you as a threat,
when they identify you as somebody could

90
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,690
do them damage,
they start going on maneuvers,

91
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,690
trying to find out everything about
your,

92
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,440
trying to find out what the worst stuff
they have on you is so that he can

93
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,160
dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a
Neo Nazi or whatever.

94
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,740
They can come up with anything.
They can grasp that because their

95
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:04,060
strategy is to dismiss the,
is to dismiss the speaker by attacking

96
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,310
the speakers credibility.
Because that way they never have to even

97
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,490
consider the merits of the argument.
They haven't been able to do that with

98
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,324
me.
Um,

99
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,930
which is why feminists now refuse to
beat me up,

100
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,660
debate me on TV because they know
they'll lose.

101
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,490
Um,
they can't bring out all,

102
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,910
they can't bring out,
they've got this battery of dismissing

103
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,540
their dismissal tactics that they've
amassed over the last 30 years and

104
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,580
they've got so complacent because
they've never had,

105
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,560
you know,
a Sassy gay person and come up and say

106
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,880
it.
You're talking bullshit and you're

107
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,580
hurting men and here are the facts.
They've never had it before,

108
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,230
so they've never built up on arsenal to
fight it.

109
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,270
Um,
you know,

110
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,630
so this is,
this is why I went and while Cook I'll

111
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,240
keep winning because they don't really
know how to deal with an argument on its

112
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,650
own merits.
And in any case,

113
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,600
of course,
the fact that we're on our so

114
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,230
well,
it's also this conversation that we're

115
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:49,460
having right now is about war.
You're saying winning and losing and

116
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:53,360
they're taking tactics and strategies to
look up dirt on the opposition.

117
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,890
They're going,
they're treating.

118
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:58,010
This is it.
This is an ideological war is not a

119
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:01,490
debate about the facts of the issue.
And I think that's part of it because

120
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:02,750
the left has always seen this as a war.

121
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,470
And the gender warriors,
you know,

122
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,970
have always been warriors.
They've always seen this in strategic

123
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:10,240
terms.
I'm not sure people on conservatives and

124
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,940
naturally more self effacing
conservatives tend to be a little bit

125
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,350
cool,
a little bit more chill about things.

126
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,184
They kind of don't

127
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,360
do you really draw it though?
How do you explain tape?

128
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,450
I think they get very angry about
things.

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,160
Explain Ted Cruz,
what am I saying?

130
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:22,780
Old Conservatives,
but he explained,

131
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,614
uh,
what's her name?

132
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,210
The Pailin chick.
Sarah Palin.

133
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,260
How to explain that.
These are the,

134
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,890
these are the outline is that Mike
Huckabee,

135
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,520
even most conservatives find these
people a bit much.

136
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,680
My car could be,
I think that guy's in isn't in the end.

137
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,490
Who knows how these cells fatter now he
was hopping around last time.

138
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,450
Well,
I mean,

139
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,570
you know,
for like the lazy got that cushion TV

140
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,210
gigs so far he got so far I cannot vote
for anyone.

141
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,790
That phenomenon of rock and rolling.
I Want Marco Rubio just because he's

142
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,624
hot.
You know,

143
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,040
if we call have Trump than I won't
regret it.

144
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,250
I don't think,
I think people are silly.

145
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,790
So whether or not it's a conservative
thing or a liberal thing,

146
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,010
I think there's a vast majority of
people that aren't not

147
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,340
very good at looking at themselves and
they're not very good at looking at the

148
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:03,830
momentum of their actions.
They just think that they're right

149
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,890
because this is what they've been saying
for so long.

150
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,650
And I think that's one of the most
horrific things about these

151
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:14,480
conversations with these women.
Get in with you about cause like when,

152
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,690
when they're talking about what they
think are social constructs,

153
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,880
things like gender identities and the
way people be.

154
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,540
And when you shatter that with the
facts,

155
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,250
they're looking for some other weapons
and there's nothing there and you see it

156
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,084
in their eyes.
You know,

157
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,090
cause it's not really a debate about the
idea itself.

158
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,490
It's just not what,
it's not what it's about is gender will

159
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,020
fat.
That's why people like Christina Hoff

160
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,930
summers cold them gender warriors
because these aren't people who want any

161
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,580
kind of social justice as they say.

162
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,760
These are people who just hate men.
Well,

163
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,650
there's hate men.
They want to hurt men.

164
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,400
Um,
they don't want to quality for women.

165
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,140
They want to,
they want superiority for women,

166
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,920
whether it's architected into the
education system or you know,

167
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,710
affirmative action or whatever it is.
They don't want quality.

168
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,510
They want superiority.
And fundamentally,

169
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,231
a lot of this,
you know,

170
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:58,850
these,
these crazy extremist,

171
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
you know,
uh,

172
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,660
progressive third wave feminists,
today's version of feminism.

173
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,930
It basically boils down to messenger and
it takes a gay guy because it's so

174
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,240
dangerous for men to even broach this
subject anymore.

175
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:11,480
And any man with a mainstream job puts
that at risk by even talking on the

176
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,170
subject no matter what his opinion is.
Um,

177
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
it takes a gay guy to go on,
you know,

178
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,460
Sky News in the UK and say,
I'm sorry,

179
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,710
the facts are not on your side and what
you're doing is damaging to women.

180
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,580
Um,
it's to me really an indictment on a,

181
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:25,910
on debate in our public square that it
is so dangerous for a man to even

182
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,340
express an opinion on this subject,
that it takes a fact they're going to

183
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,930
stick up for heterosexuals.

184
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,540
And you know,
if other men could say this,

185
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,330
they would be,
but they can't because they would run

186
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,410
the risk of their careers.
What feminists always talking about

187
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,360
silencing people icy silence to men.
Well that,

188
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,560
that is true.
There's a lot of doxing and going after

189
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:48,410
people and a lot of,
a lot of anger when it comes to all this

190
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:51,740
stuff.
But I think what you have in many cases

191
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,860
when you see this kind of like
disjointed,

192
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,120
illogical sort of way of thinking,
I think you have people that are

193
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:04,121
assholes that find a cause that gives
him the green light to be an asshole.

194
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,181
Well,
I've written about this,

195
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:05,991
you know,
I agree with you.

196
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,180
I think,
no disrespect to any particular church,

197
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,240
but I think it's reasonable to say 50
years ago if you were a bully,

198
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,100
if you are a sociopath,
do you want us to take out in other

199
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:13,670
people?

200
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,370
You want it to Rick harm on the world
that you thought would hurt you?

201
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,030
Reasonably good way of doing that would
be to join the clergy and many and many

202
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,280
people did.
And I think most of us who are

203
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,140
religious,
who have religious families know stories

204
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,520
like that.
These days,

205
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,720
you're better off getting a job at
Gorka.

206
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,711
Um,
you know,

207
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,840
if you want to bully somebody,
if you really want to hurt them,

208
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:33,230
if you have some sort of internal chaos
or damage and you want to impose order

209
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:36,470
on the world outside because you feel so
confused and broken and messy,

210
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,820
uh,
the best way to do it today,

211
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,160
it's become a social justice warrior.
Because not only do you get the same

212
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,770
kind of status in society the clergy
would have done 50 years ago,

213
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,500
but you also get media platforms.
You get money,

214
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,180
you get approval,
you get applause.

215
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,700
And if you layer on these new tactics
of,

216
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,550
you know,
fake abuse and fake Harrison,

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,090
and you know,
these terrible man,

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,860
you know,
these terrible men coming for me on the

219
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:56,040
Internet,
see if you can make quite a lot

220
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,750
of money too.
Yeah,

221
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:01,970
you can form a patrion page and then
people just sending the audio.

222
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,470
What is that?
It's like,

223
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,380
it's like a crowd fund me for my ideas.
Right?

224
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,930
So in the,
in the old days you'd have patrons of

225
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,460
the arts and there would be,
you know,

226
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,360
like a prince or some rich guy or maybe
the,

227
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,170
uh,
maybe a little later in history it would

228
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,330
be a mercantile patron.
And in the way,

229
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,350
in the way that,
um,

230
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,250
many industrialists and bankers still
give a lot of money to their local opera

231
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,890
house or something like that.
So patch on is a way of turning that

232
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,510
open into crowdfunding.
So your,

233
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,990
your patron becomes a load of people,
all of whom give you a little bit of

234
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:31,620
money.
Right.

235
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,210
So it's,
it's in theory quite a respectable and

236
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,300
interesting way of funding the outs.
In principle,

237
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,460
there's nothing wrong with it,
but it seems to become colonized by

238
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:45,000
people who are raising money on the
basis of sympathy rather than anything

239
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,870
they actually create.

240
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,200
So it's what I've,
what I've noticed in my reporting on

241
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:54,201
this is the vast majority of people
begging for money on Pantry on as far as

242
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,120
I can tell,
I'm sure Patrick and will tell me,

243
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,260
you know,
most of them went on their platform,

244
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,420
goes creative projects.
But as far as I can tell,

245
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,171
it's,
you know,

246
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,030
people bleating for sympathy,
you know,

247
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,440
fishing for empathy.
It's a,

248
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,060
there's a lot of women on there claiming
to be,

249
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,410
you know,
claiming that their lives are being

250
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:08,750
ruined by manual.
Actually look into it.

251
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,020
I can't find the tweets are talking
about,

252
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,213
um,
you know,

253
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,110
and it's,
and it's a way for,

254
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,750
there's this,
there's this great tweet by,

255
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,740
um,
what's an airport who is ochre gamergate

256
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,650
supporter.
And I can't,

257
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,140
I'm going to remember it wrongly,
but it's something along the lines of,

258
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,640
you know,
every day on the Internet,

259
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,500
some goonie beard man,
uh,

260
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,840
you know,
promises to be nice to a social justice

261
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,300
warrior in the hope of a wink or the
hope of a blow job or something like

262
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:30,480
that.

263
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,911
You know,
and it's,

264
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:34,020
it's these guys who were just sort of
throw a fiver or throw a tenner a month,

265
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:36,270
you know,
$20 a month to this video games

266
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,980
developer who's never produced anything
in her life,

267
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,170
but claims she's getting harassed and
claims are getting threats.

268
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,000
It's very,
very weird,

269
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,920
um,
psychological dynamic.

270
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,650
And I think it's,
I think it's quite,

271
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,151
it's,
it's,

272
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,960
it's interwoven with the way that
feminism has turned women into

273
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,360
professional victims,
handed them this victim hood script.

274
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,190
And most of these women are not really
to blame.

275
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,420
They're not kind of,
these aren't,

276
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,680
these aren't horrible sociopathic,
you know?

277
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,100
Warmongers these aren't people who
really hate man.

278
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:05,160
They're just a bit miserable and they've
reached for the nearest victim hood

279
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,620
script available to them because we live
in a culture where,

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,820
you know,
a victim hood is the,

281
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,070
is the most valuable currency that you
can,

282
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,450
um,
but you can amass.

283
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,830
And,
um,

284
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,410
and so they go out,
they advertise what a terrible life they

285
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,180
have and how awful people ask them on
the Internet.

286
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,870
And they ask men,
mainly it's women asking for money from

287
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,170
men.
Um,

288
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,540
you know,
effectively for sympathy dollars.

289
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,120
It's incredibly demeaning.
It's incredibly,

290
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,260
you know,
to the human spirit,

291
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,240
you know,
aside from anything else,

292
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,980
you know,
you're basically telling these women

293
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:36,981
that they have more value as winches and
liars and gender warriors than they do

294
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,720
as creators or mothers.
Um,

295
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,630
and I find that hugely destructive.
I think that what we're,

296
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:45,390
we're,
we're talking about as far as like

297
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,760
people that are assholes that just
launch off,

298
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,390
latch onto a cause.
And then that if you go to their page,

299
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,800
like there's,
there's so many of them that write and

300
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,040
you'd go

301
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,530
to their blog and their blog is just an
attack blog.

302
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,650
Yeah.
It's just consistent attacks on people

303
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:03,730
that don't share their ideas or don't or
have differing ideas of coined a term

304
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,810
for this.
What is it?

305
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,730
I've coined sentence quantum superstate
feminism and it is an,

306
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,360
it is feminism that exists at once as
aggressor and victim.

307
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,310
It is simultaneously and at all times
aggressor and victim.

308
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,870
And it's describes these women who go
out lobbing shit at people,

309
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,660
uh,
and then instantly turned into damsels

310
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,850
in distress when they,
when they see their own language

311
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,080
returned in kind,
you know,

312
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,480
quite often returned at greater volume
because what they're saying is

313
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,180
ridiculous and offensive and people get
annoyed about it perfectly.

314
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:31,811
Reasonably.
And also,

315
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:34,870
if you create an environment in which
it's fine to say anything you want about

316
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,850
man,
it's fine to say kill white men.

317
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
It's fine to publish articles in,
you know,

318
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:40,810
in,
in mainstream news media publications

319
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,520
about how to hurt man and all the rest
of it.

320
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:44,830
Just sort of several years ago,
who was just the woman recently,

321
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,500
the Google ideas woman that had the
tweet about,

322
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,900
uh,
she eats men for breakfast.

323
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,670
This is,
I think he's talking about Randy Harper.

324
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,100
If you imagine if a guy wrote that down,
I eat women for Breck.

325
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:56,921
What unit?
Do you know?

326
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:00,270
Some men do speak to women like that?
Some of the men's rights activists on

327
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,120
Twitter?
Well,

328
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,530
yes,
but do you know why men's rights

329
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,770
activists are so rude to women because
they're assholes?

330
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,230
Well,
know what they're doing.

331
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,910
It women have for 30 years said,
treat us like men were just like,

332
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:13,900
man,
we're just the same.

333
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,660
Treat us like men.
We can do anything that men can do.

334
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,970
You can do everything that men can do.

335
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,240
Men's rights activists just take them at
their word and the weight and taunting

336
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,630
is how many bombs,
you know,

337
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,540
that's not what they're doing,
how they're doing.

338
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,940
And they're not trying to bond with
these women.

339
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,430
They're trying to hurt them.
Well I think what they're doing is

340
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,080
taking it,
taking it at face value,

341
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,360
this demand for,
for us to treat women.

342
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,440
I see us for them to treat women.
Um,

343
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,350
you know,
uh,

344
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,130
just just like they would their buddies
down the pub.

345
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,950
Well if you ever actually been to a pub
when you were hearing men like

346
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,450
outplaying pain sneaker or whatever,
their fucking awful to each other.

347
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,510
But I think they're doing exactly the
same thing.

348
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:52,480
They don't want these women doing.
Everyone's just being a cunt.

349
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,640
They just like take away the gender.
It's a,

350
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,680
men are being conscious,
women are being cons.

351
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,340
People are reaching through these
internet lines turn to hurt each other.

352
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,410
That's what they're doing.
I think it's true and I'm not,

353
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,820
I'm not totally on board with a whole
men,

354
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,990
men in [inaudible] men's rights for a
second.

355
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:11,770
I think anybody who spends so much time
working on their like approval of their

356
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,110
own gender,
like w w we're supporting our own

357
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,880
gender.
Like there's a lot of dudes that are

358
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,560
pieces of shit.
There's a lot of women that are

359
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:18,700
assholes.
It's just,

360
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:21,640
I think part of the problem is that they
sort of become feminists in reverse and

361
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,740
they use the same tactics.
They like to show large police.

362
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,000
They also,
I mean it's amazing.

363
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:27,970
You go on some of these communities in
Reddit and you read some of these blogs

364
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,691
and they're sort of,
you know,

365
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:30,850
they're like fainting couch men's rights
activists.

366
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:34,360
You know,
if I have a friend Julie Bentall,

367
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,410
who's very,
very funny,

368
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:36,370
she's a lesbian,
she's,

369
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:38,140
yeah,
she's basically this dike feminist.

370
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,780
She hates men.
She made this joke and it's kind of like

371
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,460
the sort of joke I would make.
She said,

372
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:43,870
you know,
we should put all men and internment

373
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:44,704
camps.
You know,

374
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,480
they could,
they can have visitation once a month,

375
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,030
we'll have guards and they could just
stay in camps until they learn how to

376
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:51,350
behave.
If I'd said that about women,

377
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,680
the whole is fear as it were,
would be like applauding.

378
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,960
They think it was hilarious,
but because she said it in a similar

379
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,230
level of jest,
you know,

380
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,430
suddenly it was just disgusting,
outrageous thing.

381
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,780
You know,
feminists has,

382
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:04,670
men should be put in concentration
camps.

383
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,220
And I was like,
bitches really?

384
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,670
Are you fucking kidding me?
This is exactly what feminists do.

385
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,010
You are taking a joke like it,
you're taking a joke,

386
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:16,040
you're pretending to take it seriously,
and then you're starting an outrage

387
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,790
circus about it.

388
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,440
And I was like,
for fuck's sake,

389
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,620
I am out.
It's recreational outrage.

390
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,710
It is what it is.
Isn't that,

391
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,180
isn't that what this is supposed to be
like fighting against,

392
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,010
you know,
I'm in this because I'm like a cultural

393
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,930
libertarian as my colleague Alan Bakari
puts it.

394
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,831
Um,
you know,

395
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,690
I believe in classical liberalism,
freedom of speech,

396
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:33,950
freedom of thought,
freedom of expression.

397
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,210
You know,
I don't care what you believe,

398
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:36,270
I just want you to have,
I want,

399
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,510
I want to be able to interrogate your
ideas in the public square.

400
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,930
Um,
but yeah,

401
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,040
this outrage circus that so many men
seem to be getting involved in and the

402
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,761
way they treat,
you know,

403
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,820
they call,
they call circumcision male genital

404
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,080
mutilation.
And I'm like,

405
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,270
wait a minute,
isn't it?

406
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,483
You're,
you're coming,

407
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,291
you're,
you're,

408
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:52,851
uh,
you're,

409
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,684
uh,
you're one of those,

410
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,190
but no,
I'm just saying,

411
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,120
I mean,
it is,

412
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,000
look,
I'm going to write it's cutting skin

413
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,070
while I'm in favor of it purely on
aesthetic grounds.

414
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,110
I understand that these things in my
mouth.

415
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,480
Okay.
I can understand from your point of

416
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,980
view,
I can understand that your

417
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,990
baby should be able to make a decision
on later in life.

418
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
No,
no.

419
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:13,910
I,
I haven't,

420
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,020
I haven't,
but if you have a view,

421
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,450
I know lots of men don't like on this
issue and it's simply that,

422
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:20,030
you know,
it's just good grooming.

423
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,650
Frankly.
Women,

424
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,490
women go on,
women go onto,

425
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,530
I'm serious.
Women go on to the ninth.

426
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:29,960
I have boob jobs and all the rest of it.
Why stop penises?

427
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,680
Attractive,
sexy procedure that comes close to the

428
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:36,920
numbers of babies that gets circumcised.
That's done.

429
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,510
The female girl,
one of these people.

430
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:39,344
I mean,
I just

431
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,640
like birth as they're just weird,
but I think I'm in the minority here.

432
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry to offend you,

433
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,990
but I think I'm in the minority here,
but I just can't imagine why any man

434
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,530
wouldn't want lots and lots of really
good blow jobs because,

435
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,900
well,
apparently it feels better when the skin

436
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:54,850
is on or no,
no,

437
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,730
it's so much.

438
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,440
How do you know unless you've done both?
What?

439
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,940
Because I've got feedback from,
I've,

440
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,500
I've a,
it's all anecdotal evidence this way

441
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,440
off.
I've got a large sample size.

442
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,240
You just liked the way they look better
when it's all trimmed up nice.

443
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Every other woman,
which is telling you to choice based a

444
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,490
lot on what we're used to having it done
later in life.

445
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,520
It's not nice if you're fucking dumb
enough to get your Dick's getting cut

446
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:23,600
off when you're 30 I hope.
I hope it hurts the camaraderie on this.

447
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,980
You don't have to suck one of these
things.

448
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,120
Okay.
That's all I'm going to say.

449
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,750
We should leave it there.
I wouldn't have liked to believe that I

450
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,640
have the same approach that I do to
vaginas.

451
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,090
Like if a girl at a big vagina lips,
I wouldn't say d.

452
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,050
You know,
he shouldn't have kept that shit cut

453
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:38,030
off.
I think bit what it looks now.

454
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,380
It's horrifying.
No,

455
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:40,940
we'll leave it there.
That's what it is.

456
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:43,340
It is what it is.
Big nipples like,

457
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:45,800
do you gonna get them shrunk down?
That's fucking barbaric.

458
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,590
I don't know about the mind,
you know?

459
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,910
Well,
it's interesting.

460
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,660
No,
I mean I there it,

461
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,600
you know,
there people aren't scrupulously cutting

462
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,130
babies.
Dick's is stupid.

463
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,740
God Sake.
It's a baby's Dick.

464
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,880
You don't have to cut his deck.
I mean,

465
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:03,540
you know how many kids lose their dicks
every year because of infections and

466
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,720
because of the surgery goes wrong?
A lot can't win.

467
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:09,420
If you're going to take this view,
if you're going to take this line like

468
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,470
cutting babies,
Dick's,

469
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:12,670
I can't win.
I can't win against that one's

470
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,310
a surgical procedure.
I'm happy to be in the minority on this

471
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:19,530
one.
Pleasing surgical procedure.

472
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,510
You know what?
All you might be cutting all you

473
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:24,180
motherfuckers out there.
He would want to keep you full scan.

474
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:24,900
Right?
I'm going to,

475
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,890
I'm going to get,
I'm going to give these world class blow

476
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:30,140
jobs to the juice instead.
Congratulations on your worldclass blow

477
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,730
jobs.
My favorite story was my least favorite

478
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:34,470
story,
but when my favorite story to bring up

479
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:39,120
was oil in New York who had herpes and
when they,

480
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,790
when they cut the baby's Dick in the
traditional way,

481
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,000
they actually suck on the baby's penis
to stop the bleeding.

482
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,900
Have you ever seen this?
I've ever heard articles about this.

483
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:49,870
Yes,
I have.

484
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,620
Yes.
And the kid died cause a,

485
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,250
the kid got herpes from the rabbi,
the oil,

486
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,740
whatever the fuck his name is.
What a great idea.

487
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,770
Cut and baby dicks could have grown up
to solve cancer or one of those things.

488
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,980
Either one of them can be awesome.
Meanwhile,

489
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,210
nope.
Dead Baby.

490
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,220
Well,
I don't think anyone's going to disagree

491
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:13,710
with you on that particular incident.
Don't cut baby dicks,

492
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,770
but they'll have the fuck did we get on?
I don't know.

493
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:17,950
But it was inevitable.
I mean,

494
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,380
you know,
look,

495
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,670
there's absolutely a bunch of horrible
shit that happens to women on a daily

496
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:24,840
basis.
I mean,

497
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,930
every time you see these fucking Cosby
stories,

498
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,330
these women that are coming out of
nowhere about bill Cosby,

499
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:31,164
when,
when,

500
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,550
when women talk about worrying about
being drugged,

501
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,340
and if you don't know anybody that's
actually happened to,

502
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,190
or someone close to you that's actually
happened to,

503
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,040
that danger doesn't seem real.
So when you,

504
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,210
but you see this bill Cosby thing and
you're like,

505
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,580
not only is it real,
it's like,

506
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,590
here's the guy that was America's,
his voice,

507
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,210
the voice of Morality for a generation.

508
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,970
Um,
this becomes such a mania,

509
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,920
a moral panic,
like a moral panics in history about

510
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:03,890
this stuff that the genuine victims are
starting to,

511
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,040
to be disbelieved.
And this is driven by,

512
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,410
I'm sorry to say,
kind of the sort of progressive

513
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,680
narrative over fat kind of journalism.
Sabrina Erdely and rolling stone and all

514
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:15,350
these rapes we hear about,
they all seem to unravel within a couple

515
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,350
of months.

516
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,520
Is that was the rolling stone was Uva.
Yeah.

517
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:21,530
Which didn't have the virtuous girl at
Columbia didn't happen.

518
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,650
A Jute Lacrosse didn't happen.
Yeah.

519
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,030
You know,
all these things have happened.

520
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,483
Well,
yes,

521
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,090
but we should,
we should

522
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,620
be.
We should be working at how to solve and

523
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,080
prevent these crimes better.
And the waste you that is not to erect.

524
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:35,270
It is not to stage a moral panic in the
media,

525
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,340
um,
pointing fingers at innocent people.

526
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,240
And when you see,
when you as was clearly the case with

527
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,080
rolling stone,
sort of sweep under the carpet facts or

528
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,640
omissions that,
that,

529
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,260
that doubt on your story because you
think this is just something we should

530
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:51,970
be talking about anyway.
Whether this specific case,

531
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:53,410
whether we have the details right,
this specific case,

532
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,030
what happens is when all of it,
when these rape stories or whatever it

533
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:58,730
is,
um,

534
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,620
get ripped,
get,

535
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,980
uh,
success is successive rape stories get

536
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:07,981
repudiated and debunked.
It undermines confidence and trust in

537
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,290
anyone who makes that complaint.
Anyone who says this happened to me

538
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,700
right in the back of their head.

539
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,860
I think perfectly reasonably,
people are thinking,

540
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,740
oh man,
another one.

541
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,570
Um,
you know,

542
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,700
it's not a nice thing,
but this is what this is.

543
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,950
This can be the effect of a moral panic
in the media.

544
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,410
It,
it damages the real victims,

545
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,400
um,
the most.

546
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,361
And that's,
you know,

547
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,550
that's why I've written about this stuff
in the past.

548
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,860
I think it's also why it's really
important to tell the truth about

549
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:30,551
statistics.
Now,

550
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:33,310
feminists are always have a,
they have a complicated relationship

551
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:34,200
with the truth.
Um,

552
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,700
one is the one in four week.
Exactly.

553
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:38,140
I mean this goes all the way up to
Obama.

554
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,520
Every time you hear it seems to get
worse,

555
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,320
you know,
but I think we extrapolate out it's

556
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:44,890
going to be like 50 women in five gets
raped within a second of stepping on

557
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:46,750
campus by 2025.
Um,

558
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:48,100
you know,
it gets worse every time.

559
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,020
It's based on ridiculous studies.
I mean the,

560
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,340
the way I started I think Christina Hoff
Summers at the American Enterprise

561
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,110
Institute who I was site cause she's so
fantastic.

562
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,410
Um,
and so when other Unicorn,

563
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:03,340
so on point of March is feminist
feminist lever and she,

564
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:04,800
you know,
she just had some problems with um,

565
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,280
with contemporary feminism and gender
warriors.

566
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,241
Um,
you know,

567
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:08,830
she,
she does a great series of the factual

568
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:09,860
feminist.
I'm sure a lot of your viewers are

569
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:10,990
already,
um,

570
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,951
but,
uh,

571
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:12,481
you know,
she,

572
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,440
she sort of tracked down the original
study for this,

573
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:14,951
which was,
you know,

574
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:18,190
samples has about 70 people and an adult
education college,

575
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:21,340
which is so eight to so completely alien
in character.

576
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,690
I mean,
these people are like 20 years older,

577
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,860
you know,
and of course there's,

578
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:25,150
you know,
adult education cultures,

579
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:25,621
you know,
there,

580
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:26,321
there,
there are different,

581
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,930
there is a different set of social
issues that go along with adult

582
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,710
education college then,
then 20 year olds Undergrad,

583
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:33,220
you know,
what do you call them?

584
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,330
Freshmen,
uh,

585
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:35,980
you know,
[inaudible] doing a regular degree in

586
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,960
college.
I'm sample size was ridiculous.

587
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,960
The university was atypical and this has
been extrapolated out to this,

588
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:42,820
to this feminist myth that just won't
die.

589
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,530
Like,
but like the gender pay gap as well,

590
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,060
how they define like,
there's people that want definition

591
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,010
sexually,
but there's actually a section of sexual

592
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:54,070
assault and sexual abuse has been
broadened so widely.

593
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,730
What's getting crazy regret in some
universities?

594
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,030
Um,
it is part of the university's conduct

595
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:05,200
code that unwanted sexual advances.
That means me saying,

596
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,180
you're really pretty,
can I buy you a drink?

597
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,120
Constitutes sexual harassment.
Now this is just,

598
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,140
you know,
you're gonna have to close down every

599
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,670
nightclub in the country.
Um,

600
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,680
it's just extraordinary bonkers.
Um,

601
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,320
you know,
crazy stuff.

602
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,071
And this is,
you know,

603
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:20,590
30 years unchallenged feminism,
which is why I do what I do,

604
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:21,370
because I think it matters.

605
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,900
I think it's important.
I talked to Guy,

606
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,830
he's 20 years old,
you know,

607
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,030
our age,
right?

608
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,320
Um,
I don't know how old you are,

609
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:26,711
I guess,
you know,

610
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:27,640
you're 48.
Okay,

611
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:28,331
fine.
So I mean,

612
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:28,661
like,
you know,

613
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:31,090
you're,
you're maybe my dad's almost at my dad's

614
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,260
generation,
but anyone your age,

615
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,790
even right down to my age,
I'm 30.

616
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,280
It would have been a bit ridiculous for
us to say that,

617
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,230
you know,
society is architected against men.

618
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,460
You know,
when we were growing up,

619
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,230
it just wasn't the case.
And there's no point trying to pretend

620
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,300
that it was.
But I speak to boys all the time and

621
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:43,901
I've interviewed,
you know,

622
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:48,140
so many of them now have about 20,
who do go through life experiencing this

623
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,700
extraordinary,
um,

624
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,613
uh,
sort of,

625
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,430
uh,
architecture,

626
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,061
you know,
against them,

627
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,080
whether it's being,
you know,

628
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,110
wax on Adderall at school or more women,
you know,

629
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,010
getting into university for no good
reason or women as in a Cornell to 2015

630
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:03,770
studies show that women have to two to
one advantage going for a stem job in

631
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:04,490
academia.

632
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,680
Um,
so being discriminated against because

633
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:07,950
they don't have a vagina.
Um,

634
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,640
20 year old boys do have some serious
problems now.

635
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,840
Um,
and we,

636
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,310
you know,
we risk not just one,

637
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,370
but many lost generations of boys.
I call this this exodus or a big

638
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,740
two-parter about this that I think,
I think a lot of people were very nice

639
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:19,574
about,
um,

640
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,030
seem to go down very well.
Um,

641
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,130
yeah,
there's some really serious stuff to

642
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,600
address,
which is why I do one of the reasons I

643
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:24,560
do what I do because I,
you know,

644
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,060
I think that's what journalism is
supposed to be for.

645
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:26,960
You know,
speaking up for,

646
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,630
for people who don't have a platform
themselves and for,

647
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:30,111
um,
you know,

648
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:32,150
so the,
the establishment has lost,

649
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,820
uh,
lost sight of and it doesn't care about

650
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,300
anymore.
That's why I think it's important to

651
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,530
tell the truth about statistics.

652
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,070
You can't help victims if you lie,
but in your first sentence about what

653
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,890
the problem is and there is not a,
you know,

654
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,940
a systemic problematic gender pay gap in
the United States or in Europe.

655
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,760
There is not a,
um,

656
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,410
uh,
an epidemic of rape culture on campus.

657
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,710
There is not,
you know,

658
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,500
a problem in universities or,
uh,

659
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,190
with not enough women going into stem
into science,

660
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:03,191
technology or mathematics subjects.
All of these things are so subtle and

661
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,600
sophisticated explanations that,
you know,

662
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:08,120
when you were taken to account human
nature and the different choices people

663
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,050
make and what women want to do,
um,

664
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,720
you realize that this stuff is bunk,
but many of these myths simply won't

665
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,920
die.
Well,

666
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:19,010
you also have to take into consideration
there's a bunch of other variables,

667
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,930
right?
Like women leaving because they have

668
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:25,150
children and you have to factor that in
to the amount of income you can generate

669
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:25,400
gap.

670
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,960
This stuff,
this stuff is based on a

671
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,280
misunderstanding between earnings and
pay.

672
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:31,360
You can't take all the men in society
and all the,

673
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,500
we're going to get in society and do
like a two,

674
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,240
two stage calculation and said,
right,

675
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:37,610
well there's 77% as much money on this
side.

676
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,360
Right?
Right.

677
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,980
That's not what people mean when they
say there's a page where you say that

678
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:41,930
it's the way you tell it to say
something.

679
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,780
There's a wage gap.
What what they think you mean is women

680
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:47,480
get paid 77 cents on the dollar.
Do you know if that's the phrase they

681
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,910
use to a man's right,
implying that women get paid less for

682
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,530
the same work.
That's the implication that they're

683
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,660
making through all of this cause they're
confusing earnings with wages,

684
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:54,590
right?
Um,

685
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,620
earnings with pay.
What actually happens is men work longer

686
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:58,920
hours.
Men take,

687
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,670
even when you control for children,
men take fewer,

688
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,510
fewer holidays.

689
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,910
They take shorter holidays,
they work longer hours,

690
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,070
they make more money for their firms.
All the rest of it may just work harder.

691
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,350
Um,
they have longer careers,

692
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,213
et Cetera,
et cetera.

693
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,950
Um,
women prefer whether or not they have

694
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:15,920
children to have a more balanced life.
They prefer not to work full time that I

695
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:16,860
have to work part time.
They,

696
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,330
you know,
have more of a rash generalizations

697
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:23,240
because of course it was on both sides.
We all know lazy,

698
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:24,830
Lazy,
this is the way the left dog or is that

699
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:26,270
not all women are giving me a break,
you know,

700
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,220
but you know what I'm saying,
but speak in generalizations if you've

701
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:30,800
got to communicate how to do that
because you know,

702
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,920
there are,
I mean I think the term is to test

703
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:36,350
Stickley.
There are more men that are working

704
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:39,320
longer hours that are working harder,
that generate more money.

705
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,330
But to say like,
men do that well,

706
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:44,040
we all know lazy fucks it just with the
man we do

707
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,060
it.
Is that,

708
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,010
um,
the reason I phrase it exactly like that

709
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,390
is that I don't want to,
you know,

710
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,880
let's not open up the,
you know,

711
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,680
this whole,
not all men stuff that the left and

712
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,490
right,
because that's the,

713
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,930
that's that's the,
that's the,

714
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,300
um,
that is the route into this sort of

715
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:58,540
social conditioning argument.
Yeah.

716
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,620
Just objective.
Well,

717
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,200
what I'm trying to,
what the point I'm trying to make is

718
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:05,400
that men,
generally men,

719
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,410
men generally have the following traits,
right.

720
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,240
And this is reflected in employment and
you have those traits.

721
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,373
But I mean,
you know,

722
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,910
we've got to come to the lazy lazy men.
Uh,

723
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,401
yeah,
sure.

724
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:18,330
I'm there.
There are some lazy men,

725
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,660
but there were also men dropping out of
society because of,

726
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,481
you know,
because,

727
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:23,760
uh,
they feel that there's just no place for

728
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:24,421
them anymore.
You know,

729
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:26,340
they've had their,
what they consider to be their role in

730
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:27,520
the family,
um,

731
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,450
snatched away from them that I'll was
the last two generations real issue.

732
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,483
Yeah.
Well,

733
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,570
again,
I think your generation is,

734
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:37,230
my generation sounds ridiculous,
but I speak to 20 year old boys all the

735
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,690
time who are saying,
I can't be bothered with women.

736
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,250
You know,
there's this movement and midtown men

737
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,170
going their own way.
They're,

738
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,580
they're actually,
she fuck is involved.

739
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,880
Will you say that?
But there's a lot of guys know you say

740
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:50,220
that 10 years,
10 years ago we took about five days

741
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:51,390
later,
10 years,

742
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,430
10 years ago.
Uh,

743
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,990
sure.
But today the numbers are below the

744
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,120
blossoming,
that blossoming.

745
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,540
It was so fast.
And you know,

746
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,390
the thing is men deal reasonably well
without women.

747
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,560
They don't like to do it.
Look,

748
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:07,770
people who people like us are not going
to want for sex,

749
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,680
right?
Um,

750
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,550
because we're outgoing and ballsy and
brash and self confident,

751
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,384
all the rest of it,
right?

752
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,710
Uh,
we're not going to have it too much of a

753
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,300
problem,
but there are plenty of men who don't

754
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:19,380
have our self confidence and who are
being bullied and derided and ridiculed

755
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:21,900
everyday in the media at this stuff gets
you people get depressed about this

756
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:22,050
stuff.

757
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,670
This is the male suicide epidemic.
You know,

758
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:27,180
this is a huge epidemic across the
board.

759
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,691
No,
that,

760
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:28,220
well,
the number,

761
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,690
the number,
the number of female suicides.

762
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,040
I mean it's different statistics,
different countries.

763
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,480
It's a different slightly,
but you know,

764
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:34,830
the female numbers aren't really
changing.

765
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:37,590
Women are getting more unhappy a decade
after decade,

766
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,660
but they don't actually commit suicide.
They never go through with it.

767
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:40,830
When they try,
they fail.

768
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,980
They can't even commit suicide probably
there four to seven covenant.

769
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:47,520
They kind of a killed themselves
properly.

770
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,540
They're forcing the men to kill
themselves.

771
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,090
Well,
they often,

772
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,330
well we've women often road,
we went off and write the suicide notes

773
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:57,810
and then they try to kill themselves and
they fail or they call they or they

774
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:00,150
bottle it at the last minute and call.
Someone said up taking some pills.

775
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,760
They never,
they never ended up dead.

776
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,080
Uh,
but men just,

777
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,970
you know,
go quiet for a few days and then they

778
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,410
just hang themselves.
Um,

779
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,790
but those,
those numbers are going up.

780
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,160
The number of men who were just giving
up some relationships,

781
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,340
that number is going up.
I can't believe that.

782
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:17,160
See,
because then you're factoring in you

783
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,270
this kind of like,
you know,

784
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:20,430
swolled media star where he hangs out
with,

785
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:21,151
you know,
good looking,

786
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:23,220
fashionable people all got girlfriends,
you know,

787
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,450
banging,
banging our girls.

788
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,680
Um,
it's not,

789
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,080
it's not,
it's,

790
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,800
sorry,
I just had a moment then.

791
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,461
Uh,
no,

792
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:32,160
it's not your womb while married kids.
Yeah,

793
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:32,994
yeah.
Whatever.

794
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,590
I don't need to know what you get up to.
Um,

795
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,210
but yeah,
I know what you're saying.

796
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,120
This is not the case.
There's going to be no,

797
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,570
no,
it's not some unhappy people.

798
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:47,600
This is not just cancer filings of men
out there by themselves just alone.

799
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,270
Just giving up.
You should,

800
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,410
uh,
you should pay more attention.

801
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,780
You should listen to them when they're
speaking to you because they need people

802
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:53,530
like you.
Come on,

803
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,950
man.
This is a small metal really down to me.

804
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:00,160
Is it going to be this fucking British
queer who's going to stick up for these

805
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:04,130
guys when even you won't stick up?
Kick off these

806
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,140
drive out as society,
man,

807
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,540
man's radio host and these guys,
God,

808
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:17,420
what am I camp outside?
No cell phone.

809
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:20,800
This is a fucking man.
That's why I have the fucking media

810
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,200
beating down my door.
Because even you guys won't stick up for

811
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,600
men anymore.
You can't just coddle them like that.

812
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,210
If they really want to draw what groups
to hoard with girls.

813
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,201
Dude,
you can.

814
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:32,020
I'm a total sociopath,
but I still preach a little sympathy on

815
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:34,440
this issue.
How dare you.

816
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,730
But no,
I'm not.

817
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:38,010
But um,
women,

818
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,100
the feminist,
we'll call you that.

819
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:41,680
All right.
Well I think has some terrible thing,

820
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:45,100
especially where the male feminists,
but trying to get Brownie points.

821
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,000
Oh,
warm honey of the,

822
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,373
Oh,
the war.

823
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Male feminists
do their Twitter profile and,

824
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,480
but I usually don't write male
feminists.

825
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,400
They're just feminists.
Just feminist.

826
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,600
And I'm like,
Oh God,

827
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,590
how long has it been?
How long does it,

828
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,270
they just want to,
I want to ask them how long has it been?

829
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,710
Like two months.
And I'm like,

830
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:05,981
no,
no.

831
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:07,330
How long has it been?
Two years.

832
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,770
That's it.
That's why you're a feminist.

833
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,940
But this is what they don't understand
is the kind of women they're sucking up

834
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,440
to.
Don't even want them.

835
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,540
No.
Women don't want men to speak about

836
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,460
feminists.
If they don't want allies because no man

837
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,770
is ever going to be good enough to speak
about women's issues is the crux of

838
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:21,520
identity politics.

839
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,070
Modern feminists don't want men,
they hate man.

840
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,600
Stop sucking up to them.
The only way you're going to get them is

841
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,600
to connect them.
The only way you're going to get them is

842
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:32,380
to say you are a ridiculous fucking
whore and I'm paying you no attention

843
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:34,600
whatsoever and that's how you get them.
Well,

844
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,300
it's worked for me.
It works that way.

845
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,290
Okay,
maybe not that language,

846
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,720
but you know you're addicted.
You're ridiculous woman.

847
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:43,580
I'm paying no attention whatsoever.
And that key second part of the phrase

848
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,580
was what I was really focusing on that
second part of that phrase.

849
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:50,581
That's what makes him come running.
Being shuttled games like a Turkey.

850
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,574
You got to know her,
right?

851
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,840
No one to make the hand because I don't
have skin in the game.

852
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:57,550
You see?
So I'm able to analyze these things just

853
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,510
passionately.
Well,

854
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,890
there's some truth to that.

855
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,360
Certainly.
There's definitely some truth to wise

856
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,240
gate uncle,
you know who can just sort of from a

857
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:05,650
distance can tell you what's it telling
you,

858
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,520
what's going,
what's happening.

859
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,670
It's just pathetic to watch those poor
men grovel.

860
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,710
Grovel for Social Brownie points.
Yes it is.

861
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,320
And they're never going to get the hand
job.

862
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,410
I'll get,
it's not going to happen,

863
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:22,411
but it's even that they can't see that
it's not about feminism.

864
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:26,350
It's not about masculinism either,
if that's a word.

865
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,320
It's about people not being full of
Shit,

866
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,030
you know,
not crying victim when you're not really

867
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:37,810
a victim.
Not pulling the fucking fire alarm on a

868
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,260
Pr Guy who's a that Toronto thing where
the,

869
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,330
the guy was,
they totally misrepresented the position

870
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:47,990
of his book,
misrepresented what his position was on

871
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:52,130
women period and on men.
And he was just essentially trying to

872
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,880
highlight,
some men have and they were calling them

873
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,870
just,
they call me.

874
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,190
I quite like getting insults because I'd
like to,

875
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,560
I'd like to rate them.
I get them marks out of 10 and then I

876
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,960
come back to the troll and I explained
how they could've made it better.

877
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:06,970
How they could improve,
you know,

878
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,690
so I like to take my tape to troll
school.

879
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,120
And you know,
sometimes people send you good things

880
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,980
like go take up off of the toaster,
which is quite funny.

881
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:13,814
Like,
I like that.

882
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,840
That's a good one.
More people [inaudible] they just didn't

883
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,730
circuit breaker.
Well I liked to joke anyway.

884
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,380
And then sometimes it's just,
you know,

885
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,360
you deserve to die two out of 10,
you know,

886
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:24,194
come on,
you can do better.

887
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,570
Um,
if this is what they do and this is what

888
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:26,981
they do,
they are,

889
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:27,291
they are,
you know,

890
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:30,920
the insults and ridicule and demean and
tried to discredit the speaker.

891
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,020
And if they can't do that,
they will do some other kind of

892
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:34,430
silencing of no platforming and
whatever.

893
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,220
So those opinions can never be,
you know,

894
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,530
they do not want those opinions ever
aired in public because those opinions

895
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,390
and the facts that underpin them,
um,

896
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,270
the reasoning that underpins them,
which is what people go to these talks

897
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:46,700
to here is so dangerous to feminist
narrative,

898
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:47,870
which is basically,
you know,

899
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,000
based on,
on feeling and not fact based on,

900
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,883
um,
you know,

901
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,990
bigotry and Kloss and gender hatred,
not any kind of sensible analysis.

902
00:33:56,541 --> 00:34:00,170
The way the world works.
I've got so many invitations to

903
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,590
universities for the next six months,
and you know,

904
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,390
this isn't an advertisement,
20 feminists listening,

905
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:07,310
but I know this is going to happen.
Um,

906
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,600
and you know,
the talks go on anyway,

907
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:10,640
it just takes,
takes up a whole day of your life

908
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:11,480
instead of an afternoon.

909
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,171
But,
you know,

910
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:13,550
I know it's going to happen.
I've got talk,

911
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:13,881
I'm,
you know,

912
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:15,950
I'm going,
I'm speaking at Universum swings at USC

913
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:18,200
a Republican's next week.
I'm speaking,

914
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,340
um,
you know,

915
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:22,610
to a bunch of UK and US universities
over the next six months.

916
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,140
And I just know what's coming,
you know,

917
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:26,570
and it's,
it's this extraordinary like a homeless

918
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:27,261
gay dude.
You know,

919
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,930
I cracked Dick Jokes on Twitter and I do
Sky News now and again.

920
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:30,590
And if,
you know,

921
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,720
if I'm,
if I'm like the scariest opponent,

922
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:33,740
you know,
that they have,

923
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,510
they've got real problems.
Um,

924
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,550
but you are,
because of what we highlighted earlier,

925
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,370
they can't dismiss it is semi joking,
all that shit.

926
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:40,811
It's like,
you know,

927
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:45,470
semi joking but I'm not kind of a game
and make your argument for God's sake.

928
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,130
And why is it that for the last 30 years
they have been incapable or unwilling of

929
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:52,190
actually making an argument and instead
they do everything they can to simply

930
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,960
get the speaker out of the public eye.

931
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,180
Well,
because they exist in an echo chamber.

932
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,090
I mean,
I think that the,

933
00:34:57,091 --> 00:35:01,080
the forums that they go to,
the Twitter groups that they,

934
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,010
I've gone to people's pages cause I find
out they're ridiculous.

935
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,920
I read,
I read an article about this page and

936
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:07,640
went to his Twitter page and I was
already blocked.

937
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,390
I'd never even interacted with block
lists.

938
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,030
You want a boat,
you're on a block list is probably cause

939
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:15,260
you following me.
I seem to be,

940
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,330
I seem to like sort of Voldemort for
these guys.

941
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,370
Just had a few controversial things
myself.

942
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:22,160
It might just be thinking about saying
what's wasn't as controversial thing.

943
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,350
If it was at Tommy fucking,
I will take a long time.

944
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:27,020
We'd have to get me through the
Internet.

945
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,210
Uh,
what kind of say that?

946
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,130
You're saying if you are,
if you're a man,

947
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,330
you call yourself a feminist.

948
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,460
I hope you choke to death on Vegan
Pizza.

949
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:39,461
Why crying to a lady Gaga Song is that
she upset with me.

950
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,310
Variable.
Is that controversial?

951
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,590
Yes.
Is it talking about death?

952
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,030
Oh,
okay.

953
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,500
I prefer they get raped with wow.
Male rape is not as bad as female rape

954
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:52,261
though.
Right.

955
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:55,020
You could say like male rape to the
pizza.

956
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:56,730
It doesn't seem as awful.
It's funny,

957
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,230
some of us go out and search with male
rape.

958
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,680
That's a comical thing to say though.
A man being raped by a pizza.

959
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,700
Whereas if a woman gets raped by pizza,
it's just funny.

960
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,040
It's just so nuts.
Not well.

961
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,480
You see hard to,
I'll tell you what,

962
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,200
I liked it.
I liked that.

963
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,670
I liked that you find it horrible
because it shows to me that chivalry is

964
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:17,630
not dead and you have a decent respect
for,

965
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,620
you know,
for,

966
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,190
for,
for women and for speaking about women

967
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:20,580
properly.

968
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,700
And I like that you're offended by what
offended because I like that you find it

969
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:26,220
distasteful to speak of women in that
way because it speaks well of you.

970
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,560
Um,
I think what feminism is done,

971
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,340
I think what feminism has done is made
it very difficult to be nice about women

972
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:34,230
because the critic,
this environment where there's so much

973
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:38,670
hate and bile and ridiculed men,
men feel like they've got to respond in

974
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:40,690
kind or just check out entirely and
it's,

975
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,560
it's this,
that's what I don't buy.

976
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,270
I think you have a very small minority
are not very attractive who get really

977
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:53,190
upset at men.
And I have a theory about sociological

978
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:56,340
shit when it comes to these really
radical anti male feminists.

979
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,980
A lot of it is a constant state of
rejection,

980
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,510
but these disproportionate effect,
what's on these,

981
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,700
these ugly women who,
by the way,

982
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:07,020
there are all sorts of studies which I
love,

983
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:09,090
which show the ugly women are much more
likely to be liberals.

984
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,300
Um,
and of course they make sense for all

985
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:13,340
the reasons you would imagine.
Um,

986
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,640
so they find feminism or perhaps they
start losing their looks in their

987
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,080
thirties.
So they did.

988
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,790
They,
um,

989
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,980
you know,
slide back into feminism.

990
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,920
Yeah,
no,

991
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:26,040
women are gone at 30 on that.
I,

992
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,731
I'm,
I'm,

993
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm,
I like,

994
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:31,030
I like sex.
I'm the tip of gates that take,

995
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:32,820
you know,
all my eight 30 and I like to start

996
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:35,400
requesting things in their forties.
A lot of times they'll leave and go to

997
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,410
yoga,
but what the statistics show is that,

998
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,550
um,
women,

999
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,920
uh,
in their thirties,

1000
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,450
if they're still single stock a bit
nuts,

1001
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,960
they report themselves as being
generally more unhappy with life,

1002
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:47,600
more likely to have contemplated
suicide,

1003
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,290
like pressed,
uh,

1004
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,000
men considered retreat into point of
video games.

1005
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,850
But women get women,
women go nuts if they're single in their

1006
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:53,930
thirties.

1007
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,960
So thanks.
Feminism,

1008
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,780
right?
So it's all women.

1009
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,300
You see,
you,

1010
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,300
you don't know you it so much ground
already by allowing yourself to be taken

1011
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:06,960
over by this leftist clap around,
just being objective since we speak.

1012
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:08,160
It's it,
it's a soft quantify.

1013
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,060
When you say like,
you know,

1014
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:10,760
women are x,
you mean most people next is,

1015
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,740
it is understood that you speaking in
generalities,

1016
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,590
it's annoying to women that aren't like
that telling like shit,

1017
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,550
get over it.
It is understood that you're speaking

1018
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:23,310
generalities without general assays.
It's impossible to communicate.

1019
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,680
It's a British thing,
British thing.

1020
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,520
It's just a not being nit picky.
Dick,

1021
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,870
there's a simple addition to that
sentence.

1022
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:32,470
See,
well understood there.

1023
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,000
When you say are many men who have gold,

1024
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,360
men are leaving
language policing.

1025
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,550
You've given it,
you've given it over already.

1026
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,150
You have a language policing your
halfway to feminism.

1027
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,780
I had a buddy come in for a long time
and he was ugly.

1028
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,930
And um,
because he end,

1029
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:56,800
he used to get rejected all the time and
he started getting really fucking angry.

1030
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,910
And as he got older we had to stop
hanging out with them because he would,

1031
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:02,560
you know,
he would meet girls who've tried to hit

1032
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:03,610
on them.
They would say no,

1033
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:04,810
and you're like,
fucking lesbians.

1034
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:08,750
He's fucking cunt lessons and just work
out or funny or get money.

1035
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:11,830
I mean,
it's any man can do at least one of

1036
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,170
those three.
Anyone can walk out,

1037
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,750
anyone can learn to be funny.
During that process,

1038
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,820
during that process,
you still have sexual needs.

1039
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,040
So he,
he had not accomplished any of those

1040
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,870
goals.
So he was not,

1041
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,070
would not attractive to these women.
And because he wasn't attracted these

1042
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:30,820
women I witnessed over the course of
knowing him for several years,

1043
00:39:30,821 --> 00:39:33,760
I witnessed this massage Negro inside of
him.

1044
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,940
And it was based on the interactions
that he had with women that were all

1045
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,370
negative,
the interactions he had with women.

1046
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,490
He came away feeling bad about himself,
feeling rejected.

1047
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,840
And so he started to project that they
were the root cause of this issue.

1048
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,060
I had to seek.
You're dealing with a lot of the same

1049
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:50,080
phone as feminists.

1050
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,610
Problem is that society has been
architected in such a way that those,

1051
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,750
those outcomes,
those rejections are now not just the

1052
00:39:57,751 --> 00:40:00,300
norm,
but almost enforced by a woman's need to

1053
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:01,680
reject a man and to see,
you know,

1054
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,850
look at this stuff,
you know,

1055
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,670
unwanted advances,
sexual Harrison,

1056
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,910
basically what it means,

1057
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,690
it's tough,
but those are the monsters,

1058
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:11,260
the monster women who are trying to push
that they're so small.

1059
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:12,580
It's such a small percentage.

1060
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,480
You grossly underestimate the influence
these people have on not just debate in

1061
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,000
the media,
but on policy and universities and even

1062
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,470
the government.
Look at California.

1063
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:23,250
Yes means yes.
Affirmative consent laws.

1064
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,740
This stuff becomes law.
It doesn't California roll and when it,

1065
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,600
when it starts in California,
it's spreads elsewhere.

1066
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,070
Every unit,
every,

1067
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:34,520
every big American University has a
ridiculous code of conduct that's got

1068
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,920
this stuff embedded in it.
And it comes from the,

1069
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:37,820
you know that,
yes,

1070
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:39,920
it comes from the crazies.
I admit,

1071
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,060
I willingly admit that most of them were
wonderful and they don't buy into this

1072
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:45,830
shit.
And indeed of course in just what does

1073
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:49,190
it in just two years from 28% of women,
down to 18% of them identify as

1074
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:50,720
feminist.
Fewer than one in five women call

1075
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:52,190
themselves feminists because they see
what we see,

1076
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:54,560
which is that these feminists are all
misaddressed lesbian,

1077
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:55,670
manic,
crazy people,

1078
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,720
fine.

1079
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,650
But those messengers lesbian at crazy
people are effecting laws in this

1080
00:41:00,651 --> 00:41:04,010
country and in my country.
They're effecting conduct codes of

1081
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,690
conduct,
the university that dictate a man's

1082
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:08,290
entire future and a woman's entire
future for that matter and their

1083
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,370
happiness and good sexual health and,
and the that you know,

1084
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,660
at the destination of the species,
the way that men and women interact with

1085
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:16,550
each other's becoming poisoned by these
people.

1086
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,890
You grotesquely underestimate their
influence.

1087
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:21,140
If you write,
write them off as a few mad crazies in

1088
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:26,030
student unions,
but they have gigantic purchase on,

1089
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:27,940
on the media and therefore on
politician.

1090
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,550
Well,
they certainly do when it comes to

1091
00:41:29,551 --> 00:41:32,970
schools in schools to be repeating the
lots of huge issue for,

1092
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,100
for

1093
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,530
women getting,
getting a sexually assaulted on campus.

1094
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,830
Listen though,
your president is parroting these myths

1095
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,300
from these pieces.
Yes.

1096
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,420
Obama has repeated the,
the sexual harassment myth.

1097
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,940
Obama has also repeated the wage gap
myth.

1098
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,150
You've dismissing these people are sort
of powerless fringe crazies.

1099
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,600
The president of the United States is
repeating their talking points.

1100
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,190
Don't tell me these people aren't
influential.

1101
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,480
It's nuts.
Well,

1102
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,980
that's a different thing,
isn't it?

1103
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,060
I mean,
when the president,

1104
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,680
the president is really just a guy who
supposed to parrot what everybody else

1105
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:06,610
sort of already believes anyway.
And if that's what the progressive

1106
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,380
democratic person,
I don't know if a republican president

1107
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:11,300
would be any different,
they'll be a lot more Jesus talk.

1108
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,890
What else would be different?
Would tell the truth.

1109
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,030
Trump would tell the truth.
Do you really like Trump or it's a troll

1110
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,100
not accusing me of trolling.
What a horrible allegations.

1111
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:23,961
That's,
that's a,

1112
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,480
that's a,
that's a horrible whole remark to make.

1113
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,970
Um,
you know,

1114
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,060
I really,
I do really like him.

1115
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,800
Uh,
do I really want them in the White

1116
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,990
House?
You can fill in the gap today,

1117
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,560
but,
uh,

1118
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,150
but I love him.
I want to in the race for as long as

1119
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:36,710
possible.
Look,

1120
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,660
he taps into you and I both,
um,

1121
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,840
you know,
obviously I don't have a fraction of

1122
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:42,900
your,
um,

1123
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,783
you know,
uh,

1124
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,340
reaching an extraordinary audience and
fans.

1125
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:50,660
But we're both in our own ways kind of
counter cultural figures and very

1126
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:54,500
popular counter cultural figures.
And I think that you may not like this,

1127
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:59,501
but I think Trump taps into a similar
vein of frustration and suspicion and

1128
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:03,980
hatred of the establishment of the
political media classes.

1129
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,760
I think you and I both benefit from
culture to the tonight,

1130
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,670
both benefit from some of the same
instincts that make people quite like

1131
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,220
Trump.

1132
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,420
They don't like Trump because they
believe what he has to say on about

1133
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:16,070
taxation because they know he's
inconsistent on that.

1134
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,800
They might like what he says about
immigration,

1135
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,370
but they don't necessarily like the fact
that he,

1136
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,070
you know,
was a funder to Hillary and all he got

1137
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,500
out of it was her showing up to the
wedding in many cases,

1138
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,820
particularly like the way he speaks
about women.

1139
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:28,490
And I think Carly funeral was fearing it
was magnificent in that debate.

1140
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,280
But what they do like is the fact that
he,

1141
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:32,570
you know,
doesn't give a shit.

1142
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,600
It doesn't apologize and give such a
gigantic,

1143
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,930
brilliant bloody nose to the
establishment that has drifted so far

1144
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:40,280
from ordinary people.
You and I both,

1145
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,590
uh,
both net beneficiaries of that same

1146
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:45,110
frustration.
And that's why I like Trump because I

1147
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,140
think broader look,
he said,

1148
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,210
I don't want him in the White House.

1149
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,021
I'll be honest.
Okay.

1150
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,570
Don't tell anyone this,
but you know,

1151
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,600
I don't want them in the White House.
But I do understand why people like him

1152
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,940
and the instinct that people have to
like him,

1153
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:59,790
that sort of sense of mischief and a
gadfly Irishness.

1154
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,230
The reason people want to vote for him
because it makes the establishment

1155
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:05,390
Republicans so angry and they don't
understand it,

1156
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:09,320
and I totally get that and I have a lot
of sympathy for those people.

1157
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:11,630
I agree with those people on a lot of
points.

1158
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:16,870
I agree with them entirely about the
failings and a corruption of the,

1159
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:20,810
of the media and political establishment
generally.

1160
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,370
I totally agree with them on all of that
stuff,

1161
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,420
so I wouldn't call myself a Trump fan,
but I am a fellow traveler,

1162
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,560
a fellow traveler.
I think that the politicians,

1163
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,410
it's the failure,
isn't it?

1164
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,100
When it comes

1165
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,490
to American politics and American
education,

1166
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:39,300
I think there's some parallels to be
drawn and I think one of the parallels

1167
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:43,410
is that any of these ancient systems
that were established back when the

1168
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:46,620
world was completely different and
didn't have the Internet,

1169
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,680
they are no longer valid today.
They're just not.

1170
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,100
And you're,
we're clinging to these old ways of

1171
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:56,400
operating that if you try to propose
them today,

1172
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,370
no one would buy into it.
No one would buy into American

1173
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,690
universities.
If you tried to propose the way you

1174
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:05,760
would,
if you tried to propose the whole

1175
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:10,530
educational system as it is today,
what you put people out of college when

1176
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:13,470
you release them,
they are hundreds of thousands of

1177
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,690
dollars in debt with no fucking jobs to
be seen.

1178
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:20,340
And the reason it's wrong isn't that
it's anachronistic because there are

1179
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:22,740
things that are not strictly justifiable
with logic,

1180
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:23,940
which nonetheless work best.

1181
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,990
Like for example,
the monarchy.

1182
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,980
Um,
you know,

1183
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,200
there's no,
you can't make a plausible argument as

1184
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,180
to why we should have a test.
If you don't,

1185
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:32,100
if you don't,
once you get them out,

1186
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:34,140
if you don't,
somehow or another established a new

1187
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:35,420
empire,
like what happened,

1188
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,000
what happened?
And I read anything that's anything

1189
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,330
that's a necessary condition.
I just think,

1190
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:39,991
you know,
for example,

1191
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:42,420
the Monica in England,
so you can't make a,

1192
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,440
you can't make a plausible,
rational argument to establish a ruling

1193
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:49,710
monarchy in United Kingdom today,
but it works best.

1194
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,330
It's the best system,
works the best.

1195
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,420
What's best for expressed for you means
we don't get,

1196
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,640
you know,
a European style president with his

1197
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:58,560
retinue of,
of Jaguars.

1198
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:00,210
And you know,
and all of the kind of pomp and

1199
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:01,770
circumstance and nonsense that goes with
that.

1200
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,660
So that's better.
Well the British people understand,

1201
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:10,170
United Americans understand this too
actually the importance of significance,

1202
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:15,171
the binding power and the value of
tradition in institution and history and

1203
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:16,740
it's something that progressive,
progressive is hate.

1204
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,420
All of the assumptions on which these
things are based,

1205
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:19,800
they hate all of the effects of them
too,

1206
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:22,710
which is generally to um,
anyway,

1207
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,090
uh,
we,

1208
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:28,050
and I think British people instinctively
understand the value of having a

1209
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,050
national icon of figurehead and people
come from all over the world because

1210
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:32,850
they record,
they instinctively understand this too.

1211
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,900
Um,
you know,

1212
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,480
the monarchy just his works best for us.
They think that should be an earned

1213
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:38,610
position though.
I mean,

1214
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:41,840
isn't that what we're all trying to
accomplish in life is doing this.

1215
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,080
This is why I don't believe in grade
internships because I think they

1216
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:49,050
introduced a dangerous element of
egalitarianism into the system.

1217
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,970
I think people were,
Terry is there

1218
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,880
jumbo shrimp?
They will take bread to rule and they

1219
00:46:56,881 --> 00:47:00,330
should be allowed to get on with it.
Born and bred to rule.

1220
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:03,240
You're hilarious.
Now you're fucking trolling now you're

1221
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:05,580
trolling you son of a bitch.
How dare you,

1222
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,460
you know why you're trying to introduce
it.

1223
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,470
A real of a plausible dangerous level of
egalitarian to colleges and the,

1224
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:13,631
the,
the,

1225
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:18,090
the system that was in place.
And then obviously I do what my point,

1226
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:20,190
my point which,
which is a serious point is that,

1227
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,690
um,
just because it's anachronistic doesn't

1228
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:23,650
make it wrong.
There are problems with the,

1229
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,090
with the university system in America,
but I don't think just because you

1230
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,980
wouldn't construct it like it's
constructed today,

1231
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,130
that means you shouldn't do it at all.

1232
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,170
No one,
Monica is a good example of that.

1233
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,130
No one's saying that.
Well,

1234
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:35,380
I don't know if the Monica is a good
example of that because I think it's

1235
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:39,010
ridiculous.
The same Americans,

1236
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,610
Americans have the same [inaudible]
Americans have the same reverence or

1237
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,220
adjuster for the office of the United
States.

1238
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,020
You know,
the office office of the president,

1239
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:49,420
United States,
reverence for the office.

1240
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,660
Not everybody in this country likes any,
you know,

1241
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,260
any given president,
but you,

1242
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,010
but you will hear Republicans say,
don't say that about Obama.

1243
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,570
He's the president.
He's not my president.

1244
00:47:58,571 --> 00:47:59,920
I didn't vote for him,
but he is the president.

1245
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:02,300
So show him some respect for American.
No,

1246
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,950
come on Americans that Americans do have
an understanding with him than I think

1247
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,560
any president because he's just a
fucking terrible obviously,

1248
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:11,590
but we'll do sad is he?
No,

1249
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:13,000
he's reduced your standing in the world.

1250
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,070
So badly home.
No idea.

1251
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,460
Please tell me.
As a foreigner on my soil,

1252
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,800
I will say,
look,

1253
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,300
I love America.
I'm one of those,

1254
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,290
one of those,
one of those Brits who repeated by

1255
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:29,470
people when I'm not exactly sure if they
have a real stance on it.

1256
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:32,250
Like why is Obama so terrible in
comparison to other presidents

1257
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,860
kiss in Europe?
We've seen the future.

1258
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:39,610
Obama wants and we know it doesn't work.
We've seen socialized healthcare.

1259
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,720
We've seen,
you know,

1260
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:44,860
in gorgeous of the state.
We've seen these crazy feminist ideas

1261
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:48,000
about the wage gap and,
and um,

1262
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,360
and,
and rapes on campus.

1263
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,880
We have all this in Europe.
This is why America is great because

1264
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:54,070
it's not Europe.
And everything that I'd seen

1265
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,770
here from Obama suggest to me that he
wants to take America,

1266
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,520
you know,
it was used to be the case that Europe

1267
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,310
follow America's lead in so many
wonderful things,

1268
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,410
but it's pop culture and all.
And,

1269
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,750
and I personally think we'll lose all
those have been largely positive,

1270
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,310
uh,
imports.

1271
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,910
But um,
but it now seems like America's

1272
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:11,740
following,
Europe's leading in censorship,

1273
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:16,090
in cracking down on free expression and
creativity and all that kind of stuff

1274
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:16,811
in,
you know,

1275
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:19,540
socialized healthcare.
These things are disasters.

1276
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,400
You know,
you will hear from Brits because it's

1277
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:24,340
the correct thing to say.
The NHS is the envy of the world.

1278
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,800
I mean,
I would just encourage you where maybe

1279
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:27,570
you don't want to go there,
study.

1280
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,790
You don't take any sick relatives but
goes to an NHS hospital.

1281
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,430
It is horrific,
horrendous conditions.

1282
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:34,840
Dreadful people die in them all the
time.

1283
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,560
There's a scandal a few years ago,
thousands of people dying and you know,

1284
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:40,720
some hospital and the Labor government
just didn't give a shit or didn't do

1285
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:42,700
anything about it.
Even though knew this is not,

1286
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,470
you know,
this is not a glittering utopia.

1287
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,180
Fine.
There are some problems with American

1288
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:47,320
model and healthcare,
but trust me,

1289
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,970
you do not want the NHS.
Um,

1290
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,040
you know,
and the way that Obama is pushing

1291
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,890
America to be more like Europe I think
is some,

1292
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:55,210
you know,
it's going to hasten its decline as a

1293
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:59,050
world power.
We have seen your future as my colleague

1294
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:00,520
at Breitbart,
James Telling Paul wrote a book,

1295
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:03,400
I think he called it,
I think you called it a bomb Obama mania

1296
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,080
and that we've seen your future and it
doesn't work.

1297
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,470
And it was a sort of a love letter to
the United States explaining that,

1298
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:11,140
you know,
we've seen where Obama wants to go

1299
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,840
because we're living it and it's,
trust me,

1300
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:14,703
it's not what you want.

1301
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,700
But if the,
is that really what Obama wants to do

1302
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:19,620
and where he wants to go.
And if that was the case,

1303
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:24,621
like if you compare what Obama stood for
before he got into office and what he's

1304
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:26,320
doing now.
Can anybody work?

1305
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:27,154
What that,
what that,

1306
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,040
well,

1307
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,800
how about the hope and change website
where they talked about the actions

1308
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:34,160
against whistleblowers.
He is hoping to change website were a

1309
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:38,260
big part of his platform was if the
routine morning whistle blowers actually

1310
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,810
made evaporated as soon as he entered
the Oval Office,

1311
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:44,200
Guantanamo whistleblowers,
all the really important style,

1312
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,640
the morals,
the moral statements that,

1313
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:47,480
you know,
you know what it was,

1314
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:49,910
is the kind of things that tell you what
sort of man he is.

1315
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,480
Um,
the whistle blower stuff,

1316
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,390
the Guantanamo,
the things that give you a sense of

1317
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:56,360
where his moral center is.
Those were the things that he jettisoned

1318
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:59,140
the minute he entered the Oval Office.
And that's why I,

1319
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,320
why I think,
I mean,

1320
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:02,270
I'm sorry to hear,
but that's,

1321
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,940
no,
no,

1322
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:07,550
I think you have a manifesto and you try
and see as much of your manifesto

1323
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:11,510
through as you can and people hold you
to account for any one person really

1324
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:12,920
truly has enough position.

1325
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,410
I think it's a bullshit job.
I hope pointed by the United States is

1326
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:17,390
structured is to limit the power of the
president.

1327
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,500
Um,
you know,

1328
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,820
that you have all of that,
you know,

1329
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,250
built into the system and it's good.
It's all good.

1330
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,250
But he does have a huge influence on
what people talk about,

1331
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:26,940
how they talk about it.
You know,

1332
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,300
he makes decisions about foreign foreign
policy and war.

1333
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,911
Um,
you know,

1334
00:51:29,911 --> 00:51:31,140
I was one of the most important things
that are,

1335
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,430
that are a nation can decide about
itself is who it's going to fight.

1336
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:35,421
Um,
you know,

1337
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:37,850
he does make those kinds of decisions
and those kinds of decisions matter.

1338
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,760
And he also has the power to move.
Say he does,

1339
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:44,420
but he does based on what,
based on you seeing him talking on

1340
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:47,270
television,
we have no idea what exactly is going on

1341
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:47,970
behind the scene.

1342
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,610
It was the president has the executive
authority to,

1343
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:50,870
you know,
to launch whatever.

1344
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,910
You know what I'm talking purely in
practical terms,

1345
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:55,130
right?
This guy can send planes to places,

1346
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:56,280
right?
Um,

1347
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,610
but everything we've seen from Obama
suggests that,

1348
00:51:58,611 --> 00:51:59,080
you know,
he wants,

1349
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,290
he wants to take a,
you know,

1350
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:05,150
a sort of a sort of weird progressive
socialized pseudo European approach to

1351
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,210
domestic policy,
healthcare taxation.

1352
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:09,770
And this scares us in Europe because we
always,

1353
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,300
we looked up to you guys,
you were like,

1354
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,110
you know,
the,

1355
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:16,000
you know what it was America for me as a
European and you,

1356
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:18,200
you know,
your viewers are gonna pick holes in

1357
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,040
this,
I'm sure.

1358
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:22,940
But for me,
Britain is probably the greatest country

1359
00:52:22,941 --> 00:52:26,330
in the world because it didn't invent
democracy or property rights or you

1360
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:28,550
know,
any of those great values that,

1361
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:30,110
that now the world basically revolves
around.

1362
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,690
But it was,
it was the best at spreading limit.

1363
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,960
Um,
you know,

1364
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,110
England in particular spread democracy,
property rights,

1365
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,440
freedom around the world and everywhere
that Britain has been is a nice place to

1366
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:41,090
live.
And anywhere that person hasn't been,

1367
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,740
you wouldn't want to go to.
Um,

1368
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,860
and America is sort of the distillation
of the highest and best values of

1369
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:49,500
Britishness,
you know,

1370
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,640
freedom and democracy and free speech
and all this kind of stuff.

1371
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:54,220
America was America.
Like,

1372
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:55,250
you know,
this petri dish of what,

1373
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:57,890
what happened?
If we take the very best of British

1374
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:59,870
values,
the stuff that we've spent centuries,

1375
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,940
um,
propagating around the world,

1376
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,560
making the world a nice,
prosperous,

1377
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:06,050
you know,
a fair place to live,

1378
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,950
what will happen if we take them and we
cut all the crap out and we make a

1379
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:12,500
country like that.
And we did,

1380
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:15,110
it was America,
but that Americans is that you said we

1381
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:15,350
did.

1382
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:18,620
America was established by people
fleeing Britain.

1383
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,491
Yes,
of course.

1384
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:23,690
But then they enforce it
because we've been in decline for

1385
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:24,650
centuries,
but,

1386
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,180
but importing to America,
the values that Britain spread around

1387
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:29,610
the world have a hundreds of years.
But it wasn't the whole deal that we

1388
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:33,210
wanted to get the fuck away from
everything you guys represented so far.

1389
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:33,511
No,
no.

1390
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:35,770
Not everything is a misnomer.
No,

1391
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:36,121
no,
no,

1392
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,800
no,
no.

1393
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:40,020
I mean,
America is founded on British values.

1394
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,930
America was founded on values that the
British spread throughout the world.

1395
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:45,030
I mean,
these values and those values and these

1396
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:45,990
institutions as well.
I'm talking,

1397
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:46,824
I'm talking about,
uh,

1398
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,760
you know,
uh,

1399
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,340
democracy specifically kind of a
parliamentary version of democracy

1400
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:53,160
rather than a,
the particular model of democracy,

1401
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:57,140
freedom and free.
They were profiting from the TV rights,

1402
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,600
um,
you know,

1403
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,330
leave their,
that's what they were as these,

1404
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:01,350
these values,
you know,

1405
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,270
the Britains spread to Indiana spray to,
um,

1406
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,390
you know,
the bits of the Middle East that Britain

1407
00:54:06,391 --> 00:54:08,270
went to the nice places to live now
where women,

1408
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,530
women can dress,
how they like Kuwait for example,

1409
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,540
not terrible place to be where Britain
didn't go.

1410
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,570
Saudi not a place you'd want to be,
you know,

1411
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,140
any,
any way that Britain has touched has

1412
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:17,580
become better for it.
Look at Japan.

1413
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:18,570
They were all suits.
You know,

1414
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,310
they talk our language.
They were our suits,

1415
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,540
the influence,
and this is it.

1416
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,770
This is Britain,
its influence on the world.

1417
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,540
No other country,
nothing else can touch it.

1418
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,430
Not Portugal,
not Holland.

1419
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:30,210
Nobody else can touch Britain for just
sheer global influence.

1420
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,860
Australia,
Canada,

1421
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:32,671
all places,
Britain's,

1422
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:36,600
that Britain has touched are
dramatically better as a result.

1423
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,480
But for me,
the sort of highest distillation of

1424
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:40,740
those,
those values that,

1425
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,300
that Britain was spreading around the
world,

1426
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:45,990
it was a America and Obama is tearing
America away from those values.

1427
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,390
That's what I don't like.
That's why I said it was a terrible

1428
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:50,130
precedent.
That's why I struggle with,

1429
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:53,730
with him in that office because he seems
to me to be profoundly,

1430
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:55,770
and I know that,
I know this is something that sort of

1431
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:57,320
crazy right wingers on the internet
always say,

1432
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:59,300
but he just seems to me to be profoundly
on American,

1433
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,420
on American Pacific respect.

1434
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:06,870
He doesn't value,
he doesn't share the values on which

1435
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:09,960
America was founded.
In what sense though?

1436
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:11,820
And what way doesn't believe in free
speech because they think it's free

1437
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:14,640
speech should be curtailed to save the
feelings of certain,

1438
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,260
uh,
intro interest groups and minority

1439
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:17,970
groups who doesn't believe in,
you know,

1440
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:19,910
he doesn't believe in,
why are you saying that?

1441
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,290
Where have you heard him say that?
Oh.

1442
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:24,210
Because the,
the effectively the,

1443
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,250
the stuff he says about Harrison didn't
have,

1444
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:26,851
you know,
he's,

1445
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:28,950
he's,
he's bought into this Harrison nonsense,

1446
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,890
this stuff he said about net neutrality,
the stuff he said about the rape campus

1447
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,733
stuff,
all of this,

1448
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,150
all of these things are satellites of
the free speech argument,

1449
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:38,190
right?
Net neutrality being a satellite of the

1450
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:39,910
free speech or was this all about free
speech?

1451
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,540
Net neutrality and what's about
government regulating the internet?

1452
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:42,770
Yes.

1453
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,780
It's about regulating.
It's about the gut known.

1454
00:55:44,781 --> 00:55:46,140
It's about the government regulating the
internet.

1455
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,000
The,
and it needed new channels is about the

1456
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:50,850
government regulating the internet,
having control over what private

1457
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,180
companies can do about the relationship
that a private company has with its own

1458
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:55,014
customer.
Right?

1459
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,160
You have a service firm,
I don't know what your providers like a

1460
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,800
Comcast or whatever.
Um,

1461
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:59,970
you know,
your,

1462
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:01,530
your,
your relationship with Comcast is a

1463
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:03,870
private business arrangement between you
and that company.

1464
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,790
Right?
Net neutrality is about the government

1465
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:09,300
trying to intrude on that relationship
and dictating what kind of business

1466
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,080
arrangement you can come to with con
Comcast and it's going to say Comcast,

1467
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:14,760
you can not offer this package of
services.

1468
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,000
You cannot suggest to the customer that
they might be uh,

1469
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,170
a higher tier service for people who pay
more.

1470
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:20,100
Just like,
you know,

1471
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,860
you can get a better car if you pay more
or you can get anything else in life.

1472
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:24,010
If you've

1473
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,360
got more money,
you get a better version of it.

1474
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,860
Right?
You can't do any of that.

1475
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,320
We're going to insist because we've got,
we've got this crazy idea of the

1476
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:31,180
internet is some kind of utility,
um,

1477
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,680
you know,
like a water or something.

1478
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,970
We're going to come in here and we're
going to regulate and control the

1479
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:38,890
relationship that you are a private
company have with you.

1480
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:40,600
A private individual that is,
you know,

1481
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,670
that is,
that is at its essence of free speech

1482
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:46,600
argument because of what happens when
you start regulating that traffic.

1483
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:48,640
Now the Internet traffic that is split
down,

1484
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,080
you know,
some of it's for Netflix,

1485
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:51,580
some of us for emails,
some it's whatever.

1486
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,650
The way in which certain things get,
you know,

1487
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:57,130
what it wants to do is say the all
traffic is neutral.

1488
00:56:57,131 --> 00:56:58,420
It is.
That is all equal.

1489
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,180
Yeah.
Well do not see the benefit of that.

1490
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,120
Do not see that [inaudible] has no basis
in,

1491
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:07,510
do you not see that people would be
concerned with the government being able

1492
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,560
to throttle internet away and puts not
what it's about.

1493
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:15,070
Managed operations have them have the
ability to decide how much bandwidth

1494
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:18,700
goes to meringues.
Americans were worrying about the power

1495
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,190
of corporations as well.
It's not just worrying about it.

1496
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:24,730
It's knowing the fact that this has been
done illegally already without

1497
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,620
regulation.
You think for a second that if the,

1498
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:30,670
if the government has given the power to
regulate how an Internet service

1499
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:33,640
provider delivers it's packets of data
to consumers,

1500
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:37,090
they're not going to then start to
wonder what's in those packets and then

1501
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,350
start to say,
well actually,

1502
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:40,420
you know what?
The net neutrality thing was fine.

1503
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:42,880
Like it was a really good idea and we
loved it and we really haven't bring

1504
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:44,440
that to you,
but actually we've decided that this

1505
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:45,550
kind of data is more important.

1506
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:46,750
So we're going to let you do that all
in.

1507
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,230
Or indeed we're going to insist that you
prioritize this kind of data and that

1508
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:53,260
has consequences for the free market.
That's conference consequences for

1509
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,170
businesses for example.
Um,

1510
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,680
you know,
in forcing,

1511
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,740
well,
well that's why an open internet where

1512
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:04,070
everyone has access to the same sort of
service is what everybody wants.

1513
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,153
No,
uh,

1514
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,020
I mean that's what we want.
I mean there is an argument in America,

1515
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,860
there's an argument that in insisting
that all packets a day show on the

1516
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:16,540
Internet are treated equally favors new
startups into the market because they

1517
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:19,790
don't have to compete with incumbents
who have privileged access to high speed

1518
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:24,220
an argument.
I'm sure it's not just startups,

1519
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:26,770
it's people like me that are able to
broadcast things.

1520
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,680
People that want to set up their own
servers and put together their own

1521
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:31,660
website that does whatever the fuck they
wanted to do.

1522
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:35,170
That.
The idea that that is related in somehow

1523
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,033
or another.

1524
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,430
It's not about regulation.
It's the absence of I'm fine,

1525
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,080
I'm,
I'm,

1526
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,240
I'm,
I am speaking for the absence of

1527
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:44,980
regulation.
I'm saying we should not regulate that.

1528
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:49,780
We should allow private companies,
private companies to do and have

1529
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,980
whatever influence they want.
If you know,

1530
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,610
look,
the market works in these,

1531
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:58,300
in these situations,
look what happens when Isp is try to

1532
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:01,330
manipulate Netflix traffic.
Customers complain and they have to stop

1533
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:05,170
and they have to put it back again.
The market works so well for this,

1534
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:07,330
for Internet stuff because everybody
internet so vocal,

1535
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:08,770
they're online already.
They complain about it.

1536
00:59:08,771 --> 00:59:10,930
It takes two clicks.
The market works brilliantly for this

1537
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:14,920
stuff.
Why allow the government to come in and

1538
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:18,190
dictate to private individuals and
private corporations what their business

1539
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:20,860
relationship should look like and the
nature of the services that they provide

1540
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:21,980
or money they provide.
One another

1541
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,070
that's that's profoundly on American.
Well,

1542
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:28,160
there's a,
a large argument against net neutrality.

1543
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,780
There's a large argument online that we
could spend hours going over the pros

1544
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:36,800
and cons of each side of it.
But I think ultimately people have a

1545
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:41,780
distrust in large corporations and a
distrust in the government and either

1546
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:46,290
one of them having control of what has
been like the one thing that's empowered

1547
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:51,291
people in this country is the ability to
put out a message and to get

1548
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:54,560
information.
And the fact that you can do it now just

1549
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,720
because,
but it could just be cause throttled.

1550
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:58,190
It could be,
it could be limited.

1551
00:59:58,191 --> 00:59:59,780
You could,
it could be blocked.

1552
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:05,020
There's like
seriously theory UN thing.

1553
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,590
Have you been paying attention to you as
you went proposal the one who reported

1554
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,620
on at first it tell people then.
Okay.

1555
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,420
So um,
the UN broadband commission,

1556
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:17,430
which is not one of the upper echelons
of the UN,

1557
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,320
um,
he were the one who reported on the

1558
01:00:19,321 --> 01:00:20,400
first,
how'd you get the information?

1559
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,010
Well,
uh,

1560
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:23,130
so somebody else brought the story,
but I was the one that reports that are

1561
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:24,390
linked.
So my story is the one that went around

1562
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:26,250
the world.
So tweet your story.

1563
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:27,503
Yeah,
I think so.

1564
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,290
Powerful,
powerful neuron.

1565
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,090
I know,
right?

1566
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,330
I'm kind of a big deal.
Um,

1567
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,160
that's what I hear.
But

1568
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,870
explain the ridiculousness to this idea
that the UN thinks that they're going

1569
01:00:37,871 --> 01:00:38,320
to,

1570
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,250
but this is,
this is,

1571
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,310
this is my argument.
You see this is the government getting

1572
01:00:42,311 --> 01:00:46,720
involved
in your say excited and the government

1573
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:52,810
people don't censoring the UN is saying
that and this is wacky crazy stuff,

1574
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:54,250
right?
This report from the UN broadband

1575
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,630
commission,
the UN broadband commission,

1576
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,580
this is what we have in Europe.
So I don't want you to look from Europe.

1577
01:00:57,581 --> 01:01:02,360
Police have become Europe.
We have in in Europe Commission is

1578
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:06,160
specifically set up to find ways it is
paid for by European payers and it's

1579
01:01:06,161 --> 01:01:08,140
purpose is to find ways of regulating
the internet.

1580
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,280
Right?
That is what it's for.

1581
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:10,241
It is to,
you know,

1582
01:01:10,241 --> 01:01:12,490
it has a,
it has a brief to find ways of,

1583
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,120
of cutting down on Internet freedoms.
One of the ways it's found to do that is

1584
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:20,290
to get a lot of bat shit crazy feminists
in to say that people who ridicule or

1585
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:23,200
criticize them on the Internet are in
fact guilty of harassment and abuse.

1586
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,260
And as a result,
Internet services should be almost

1587
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,590
prescreened,
you know,

1588
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:30,350
words should almost be prescreened
before the ever appear on the intentions

1589
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:32,740
is the most crazy bullshit.
You know,

1590
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,340
only European come up with this and this
report came out and it was full of holes

1591
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:38,630
and we examined it.
I think I was with the first report when

1592
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,710
it's detail about this.
I read about it once or twice and um,

1593
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,330
and then I wrote about it a second time
and I think the headline was,

1594
01:01:43,331 --> 01:01:46,240
am I the only responsible tech
journalists,

1595
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:48,990
journalists left on the planet,
which is the only perhaps example self

1596
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:50,800
congratulatory of you.
Well,

1597
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:53,170
I'm actually really modest.
I'm actually really humble.

1598
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:56,920
I'm like a very humble person naturally.
But my sub editors just bully me into

1599
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,290
this stuff.
You understand how they got to get those

1600
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,080
clicks?
I know this is not me at all.

1601
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:04,210
If it were up to me,
I'd just be at home anyway.

1602
01:02:04,211 --> 01:02:06,610
So what they want to do is sort of like
pre,

1603
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,340
pre brief all of this stuff a pre pre
check it.

1604
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:10,400
And if they don't,
they want to clamp down.

1605
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:15,401
And I ask what you're doing right now is
your saying it's okay for the government

1606
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,220
to get involved in this of regulation

1607
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,740
of what s of the private relationship
RSPs have with the customers.

1608
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,550
But it's not okay for the government get
involved in this kind of regular,

1609
01:02:25,551 --> 01:02:30,551
keep the pipes open decks open to all
bullshit they want on the Internet.

1610
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,590
No restrictions out of here.
Everybody,

1611
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,520
nobody's giving you any different.
They suggesting that that's not going to

1612
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,980
be hazy.
You think you're not until it's already

1613
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:42,060
in place.
I mean the,

1614
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,430
the UN thing is essentially a Trojan
horse,

1615
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:45,690
right?
I mean that's really what it is.

1616
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,340
That's what was so disturbing about it
is the idea that the UN could get in and

1617
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:55,240
get involved and somehow or another
punish a social media websites that uh,

1618
01:02:55,241 --> 01:02:58,140
and,
and make them responsible for what the

1619
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,540
users' posts.
You post some inflammatory,

1620
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,910
ridiculous shit and they let him see
that their name never.

1621
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,540
But if you did,
if you went on a fucking late night,

1622
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:10,440
cocaine fueled Twitter rampage and you
typed a bunch of ridiculous shit about

1623
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:14,990
women with no with no like some women
are there.

1624
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,660
Ours who had all just women.
If you do blah,

1625
01:03:16,661 --> 01:03:16,921
blah,
blah,

1626
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:20,520
blah,
some dreary nit picker like,

1627
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,000
yeah,
I guess I could me,

1628
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:23,963
dude,
that's my

1629
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:30,420
fellow.
Here comes another true thing.

1630
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,210
Everybody's got their thing.
I like to leave a mark.

1631
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:35,090
You're a Drury.
Nitpicking like to leave a mark on

1632
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:36,150
people.
I have my hair,

1633
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:38,670
you'll go nitpicking.
You know,

1634
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,593
I mean,
look this,

1635
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,030
there's actually an interesting
discussion around around this and it's

1636
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:42,864
that,
um,

1637
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,480
it's about comment sections and
commenting what people are allowed to

1638
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,490
say on the Internet,
right?

1639
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,390
There's this huge trend at the moment
and almost every progressive publication

1640
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:52,830
as either closed their comments section,
we'll indicated that they might,

1641
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,300
in the early days of the Internet,
you had these tech savvy progressive's

1642
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,580
disproportionately based on coastal
cities,

1643
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,850
coastal cities who said,
because the only people they knew who

1644
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:05,250
used the internet,
we're like of them were hipsters and

1645
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,173
coastal types.

1646
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,150
Who said that the Internet was going to
create this extraordinary,

1647
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:13,120
an amazing new world where everyone
could express their opinions.

1648
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,390
It was going to democratize knowledge
and democratize power.

1649
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,580
Um,
and the presumption they made was that

1650
01:04:17,581 --> 01:04:18,960
everyone,
the Internet was going to be nice.

1651
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,990
Well,
most people aren't very nice and most

1652
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,200
people are particularly aren't nice when
I'm in that as a compliment by the way,

1653
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:28,290
cause I hate most people.
Most people hate nice people.

1654
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,110
It's boring.
I let people who have vicious and bitchy

1655
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:32,180
and mischievous,
you know?

1656
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,540
No,
I just,

1657
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,610
every time I do a show this,
it just comes back it Gavin McInnes did

1658
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:41,400
not even wait.
Gavin McInnes did not even wait.

1659
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,350
I was on his show for three minutes and
he's like,

1660
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,370
you have any idea how gay you are?
Well that's Gavin style.

1661
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,410
I'm a kinder,
gentler.

1662
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,710
You waited an hour,
hour and five minutes.

1663
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:54,260
Fine.
I'll skip.

1664
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:59,260
Guess what you just said was so good.
I like people that are fishes and bitchy

1665
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:02,460
and
interesting.

1666
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,200
Well there's plenty of assholes out
there.

1667
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,600
You're going to have them sent to be
nice.

1668
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:11,260
So I'm sure you get on tougher.
They tend to be very tentatively,

1669
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,780
pathologically.
And Helen Dario,

1670
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,030
I like.
People are a bit more dangerous.

1671
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,920
I'm always attracted to it.
So you like shitty people online.

1672
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,980
See people,
I like people who are more interested.

1673
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:23,080
I like people to step outside the
Overton window.

1674
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:25,810
I like people who pushed the boundaries.
I like people who are dissidents.

1675
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,710
I like people who are disreputable and
mischievous and interesting.

1676
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:32,080
I'm attracted to interest in people as I
am.

1677
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,060
Right.
Not all during it because,

1678
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:35,380
but uh,
you know,

1679
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:37,850
I love people like that fascinated me.
I think they're the people who pushed

1680
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,250
society for the people who come up with
a great,

1681
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:40,960
interesting theories.
Just can't,

1682
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,360
sometimes they're just cans.
But that can be funny too,

1683
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:44,194
that,
you know,

1684
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,600
that's the entertainment.
I mean,

1685
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,660
I,
for example,

1686
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:48,670
I'm not going to add to the sum total of
human knowledge.

1687
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,340
I'm just going to wind a lot of people
up for 30 years and hopefully something

1688
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,250
good about yourself short.
You're,

1689
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:57,880
and you're making some very interesting,
do you know,

1690
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,983
you are humble.

1691
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:02,170
You make interesting points.
Let's go back to the point please.

1692
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,450
The um,
the,

1693
01:06:04,451 --> 01:06:05,970
uh,
the comment section stuff right there.

1694
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,520
This was based on a presumption that
everybody on the Internet was going to

1695
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,690
be,
you know,

1696
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,710
like a Twitter employee,
Coco blogger.

1697
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,150
Yeah.
So they come out of this idea,

1698
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,050
you know,
as great Internet,

1699
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:15,730
social media,
social is gonna be the new thing.

1700
01:06:15,731 --> 01:06:17,130
We are the guardians going to throw it
to newsrooms,

1701
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,420
open to the public and the assumption
that,

1702
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,880
you know,
you know,

1703
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,900
the Guardian readers and people who live
in north London,

1704
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:24,460
which is something like Portland or
Brooklyn,

1705
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:27,010
Brooklyn or whatever sort of,
um,

1706
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:29,160
sort of north of London and it's like
the hipster enclave.

1707
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,850
No,
it's more actually sort of like posh,

1708
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:32,290
rich liberals.
Um,

1709
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,880
but it's not quite,
it's not directly comparable,

1710
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:34,220
but it,
you know,

1711
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,053
instead of like,
you know,

1712
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:36,460
roughly like that,
you know,

1713
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:38,170
they were going to be homogenous,
nice,

1714
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:40,000
polite lefties with the correct opinions
about things.

1715
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,490
Actually what's happened is it took
longer.

1716
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:45,400
It took longer than I anticipated.
But what's happened is that ordinary

1717
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:49,030
people now can open Twitter accounts too
and not sufficiently technologically

1718
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:51,670
educated to do so.
And what all of these progressive media,

1719
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:52,810
um,
uh,

1720
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:54,980
companies are discovering the Mike's the
boxes,

1721
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,280
the buzz feeds,
the caucus of this world are discovering

1722
01:06:57,281 --> 01:06:59,890
that most people don't agree with them.
They are just,

1723
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,600
they've never,
I know it's shocking,

1724
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:05,050
but most people don't believe you should
kill all men.

1725
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,470
Most people don't believe that white
people that,

1726
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,040
you know,
black people can't be racist.

1727
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,470
I,
most people don't believe in this extra

1728
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:15,070
everything on salon.com nobody believes
everything else down.

1729
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,500
Doesn't believe what's on salon.com.
Look,

1730
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:21,160
it's impossible to believe those things
in good faith because you have to lie to

1731
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:23,500
make that you have to lie so much to
yourself and to others in order to make

1732
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:24,850
those arguments that I don't,
I just,

1733
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,280
it is one long practical joke.

1734
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:28,990
That site,
it is just a gigantic,

1735
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,750
it's the Santa,
I'm convinced it's funded by the Koch

1736
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:34,360
brothers to discredit a liberalism.
I'm convinced,

1737
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,490
absolutely convinced.
If you trace,

1738
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,290
if you trace the sell on money back far
enough,

1739
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,870
you will discover,
you will discover the surname coke

1740
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:46,060
because it is the only explanation for
how badly sal on discredits

1741
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:49,840
progressivism is the only exposure.
Just today they published another

1742
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:52,420
editorial from this fucking pedophile.
Um,

1743
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:55,060
you know who I wrote about and he
wouldn't even dare bring my name up

1744
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:57,250
because he's too scared to get into it
with me cause he knows he will lose.

1745
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,120
I probably,
you know,

1746
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,710
he published this thing about how,
you know,

1747
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,660
I'm a pdf farb I don't act on it.
Um,

1748
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,870
right after I had exposed a pedophile,
Sarah Nyberg in Gamer Gate,

1749
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:06,280
right.
And it went all over the world.

1750
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:07,670
And it was this huge story that I
brought the,

1751
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:10,000
hold on,
I'm going to stop [inaudible].

1752
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,940
I exposed this,
I have a brand on file.

1753
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,800
I exposed this pedophile,
you know,

1754
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,180
she was backed up and they doubled all
the social justice warriors.

1755
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:18,890
Doubledown protected her because she
was,

1756
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:19,880
you know,
on message.

1757
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:20,840
Basically,
she had the right politics.

1758
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:23,210
So they stuck around a kiddy fiddler.
This is the state of the modern left,

1759
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:26,150
um,
directly after that with a coincidental

1760
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:28,070
timing.
Sal on publishes this thing by a

1761
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:29,100
pedophile saying,
oh,

1762
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,290
I'm a bit of hope,
I don't act on it.

1763
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:32,840
Which is precisely the defense that
there's this person who used.

1764
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,330
Um,
so I respond and I,

1765
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,313
you know,
and I,

1766
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:37,580
and I,
I did a,

1767
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,730
I did a very good piece of knowing,
I urge all of your listeners to seek it

1768
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:42,290
out because it really is excellent
journalism.

1769
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,990
Yeah.
It was called something like,

1770
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:46,830
this is why the left.
So this is why liberals,

1771
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,840
this is why progressive's stick up for
pdf files explains why,

1772
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,350
um,
pdf files can get away with this stuff.

1773
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,630
And why white progressives and liberals
back then,

1774
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,920
um,
you think people back pedophiles or they

1775
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,560
make excuses for them.
They make excuses for them as just

1776
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:06,590
today.
Today they gave us space to this guy who

1777
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:09,470
was a pedophile about whom there is
horrific stuff online which hasn't come

1778
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:10,221
out yet,
which you know,

1779
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:12,170
you should watch this space for that.
Cause I know Steven Crowder knows about

1780
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:13,630
some of it and sort of why,
um,

1781
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,110
excuse me.
Uh,

1782
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,580
you should,
you should just go,

1783
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:17,710
who wrote this?
Oscar?

1784
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,930
Did he give me a second?
Yeah,

1785
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,060
under his own name.
This is how brazen they'll row a second

1786
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:27,200
piece for salon today playing the victim
saying that he came out as a pdf file

1787
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:31,390
and he's been subjected to right wing
hate so that he says this is the right

1788
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:36,170
action.
On one hand I'm the creative file and I

1789
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:38,900
think so I'm a pedophile and I don't act
on it.

1790
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:43,070
And I did this like peace and everyone
like came out and said that it was

1791
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:45,710
really supportive and it was really
great and that they help people to get

1792
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:48,140
through their own experiences and
everyone's really sympathetic except the

1793
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:51,500
right wing hate machine meaning me.
Well they didn't dare mention me by

1794
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:52,430
name.
Um,

1795
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,970
who are the right wing hate machine?
Well apparent according to him.

1796
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:56,980
Um,
you know,

1797
01:09:56,981 --> 01:09:58,040
uh,
uh,

1798
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,440
exit the right wing hate machine had the
temerity to say we think pedophilia is

1799
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,660
role and why is that on giving a
platform for it to this guy when there's

1800
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:08,330
so much dirt on the Internet suggesting
that he is physically touched young

1801
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:10,080
girls for example.
Um,

1802
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,143
you know,
and I'm going to,

1803
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,000
yeah,
there is a completely different arguing.

1804
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:18,050
Well this is the thing that you sell on.
Gave a platform to this guy in San Juan

1805
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,010
ought to have known about this
allegation.

1806
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,840
If you're going to,
if you're going to make space on your

1807
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:24,440
platform for a self confessed pedophile
and you will,

1808
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,620
you will only find this on the left is
what I mean by the left.

1809
01:10:26,621 --> 01:10:28,250
Sticking a couple of hours.
They make excuses when they try to

1810
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:29,330
legitimize them.
They tried to give it,

1811
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:34,480
they tried to habilitate this as,
as an unfortunate sexual orientation

1812
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,840
rather than,
you know,

1813
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,480
these people being dangerous predators
that we need to be protected from

1814
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,450
sitting there.
But you're saying all I've seen is

1815
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,110
discussing this,
but no,

1816
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,700
honestly all bullshit aside like
psychologists and sociologists and

1817
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:53,900
neuroscientists or tried to figure out
what it is that causes someone to have

1818
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:55,670
these desires.
But we know from the transgender debate,

1819
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:57,830
the left doesn't care about that.
When it cares about is who it can,

1820
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:58,430
uh,
you know,

1821
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,980
where it can place people in the
oppression Olympics and the victim

1822
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:03,160
hierarchy and pet.
If I'm telling you I'm warning you now

1823
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:06,440
is the worry,
I'm warning you now is that as the

1824
01:11:06,441 --> 01:11:08,810
native files,
pedophiles are going to be the next,

1825
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,250
transgender has been one.
Now they've won,

1826
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,360
they've won.
That battle is over.

1827
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:12,770
Um,
do you think so?

1828
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,530
Yes.
Honestly,

1829
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,160
absolutely stay.

1830
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,250
It's done and dusted
by we,

1831
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:20,760
I mean people who actually wanted to
find out what the science said to

1832
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:23,540
continue to invest in things that are
now unfundable um,

1833
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,960
you know,
certain bits of research that don't

1834
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:27,570
agree with a progressive consensus,
which now can't get funding for that

1835
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:30,030
consensus is what kind of research?
Well,

1836
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:33,420
um,
so transgender,

1837
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:37,020
the transgender question is complex and
difficult and for example,

1838
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,040
Johns Hopkins doesn't do the surgeries
anymore.

1839
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,460
The guy who used to run it there is a
very outspoken critic of transition

1840
01:11:41,461 --> 01:11:43,080
surgeries is not the best treatment
pathway.

1841
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,580
Um,
they all end up killing themselves

1842
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:47,640
anyway by most most metrics,
no improvement in suicide rates.

1843
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,110
Um,
my view on this is,

1844
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:50,460
you know,
we're probably going to look back in 30

1845
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:53,040
years and wonder how we could ever have
been so cruel as to allow somebody with

1846
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:57,210
a psychiatric delusion to start hacking
at themselves to make reality conform to

1847
01:11:57,211 --> 01:11:58,044
their own delusions.

1848
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,360
But I'm not but by,
but by we earlier,

1849
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:02,940
what I meant was people who want to be
science lead on this and instead what

1850
01:12:02,941 --> 01:12:04,170
the left very,
it was very,

1851
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:05,670
it was,
there were on the cover of Time magazine

1852
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,810
Trans,
you know the,

1853
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:09,390
the Trans thing is the next civil rights
frontier.

1854
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,150
They very clearly articulated,
they gave us all the clues we needed to

1855
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:13,350
work out how they were going to fight
this one.

1856
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:14,790
Right?
And we just didn't pay any attention at

1857
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:16,110
the time or some,
some people didn't.

1858
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,470
Um,
they set it up as the next gay or the

1859
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:23,580
next bisexual or the next lesbian.
It's just the next frontier in the civil

1860
01:12:23,581 --> 01:12:25,050
rights struggle.
I'm telling you,

1861
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,760
pedophilia is the,
is the one after that.

1862
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:32,030
But don't you think that if you are a
person and you are of sound mind and

1863
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:37,200
body and you have a desire to be a woman
and you've had this desire your whole

1864
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:38,760
life,
but you were born a man,

1865
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,700
shouldn't you be able to do whatever the
fuck do you want to do other people?

1866
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,730
Isn't that really what it is?
There are people who wake up one day and

1867
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,430
think their arm doesn't belong to them.
We don't cut their arm off because they

1868
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:50,560
think it doesn't belong to them.
There are people who believe that they

1869
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,400
have someone draw on you permanently.
I think it looks hot.

1870
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,910
Thank you very much.
I like it too.

1871
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:59,360
How far?
How far?

1872
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,120
The sleeves?
Just sleeves.

1873
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,540
But you see my point like,
no.

1874
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,790
Why?
Why brain tattoo tattoos with being born

1875
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:08,990
as long gender choice.
First of personal permanent.

1876
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,910
There is a view that you should be able
to do whatever you want to your body.

1877
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,930
My argument,
we,

1878
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:13,441
yeah,
fine,

1879
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:16,950
but don't make the state pay for it.
I don't want to pay for your cock off

1880
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,110
because you're mentally ill.
Um,

1881
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,620
I will try to dissuade you from doing it
and I,

1882
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,820
I should have a right to say in a
national newspaper,

1883
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:26,310
which now you don't,
please don't do this.

1884
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,450
Well,
I think the argument,

1885
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:28,800
you can't get published in national
newspaper,

1886
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:30,570
this argument,
you cannot get published by saying,

1887
01:13:30,571 --> 01:13:32,040
please don't do pizza.
Have transitioned surgery.

1888
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,920
It's the wrong treatment pathway.
You cannot get published because of

1889
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:36,960
public opinion,
because people were worried about the

1890
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:38,250
blow back from the left.
Right.

1891
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:39,690
And these things,
they just dream left.

1892
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,350
I mean,
if I see,

1893
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,020
if ever you needed evidence that the
trainees are mentally ill,

1894
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,490
it's tranny campaigners.
I mean,

1895
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:47,580
the transgender lobby are nuts.
The reason journalists don't want to

1896
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:49,950
write about this stuff or don't want to
enter the dangerous territory,

1897
01:13:49,951 --> 01:13:52,830
is that what they are?
And the receiving end of afterwards is

1898
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:53,551
just,
I mean,

1899
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:54,384
I've,
I've had it,

1900
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,090
well,
I've had it to my,

1901
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,130
my confrontation,
the,

1902
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,183
yeah,
yeah,

1903
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,591
yeah,
yeah,

1904
01:14:01,591 --> 01:14:02,311
of course.
And you know,

1905
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:04,020
you're right about that.
It's so unfair.

1906
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:06,000
You know,
these women who are getting the crappy

1907
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:11,001
now of them by somebody who's not only
unfair if you don't say that you used to

1908
01:14:11,171 --> 01:14:14,380
be a man,
but you should have the ability to say

1909
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:16,810
yes for new option to opt out and they
shouldn't.

1910
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,250
I mean,
what are we going to do?

1911
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:21,490
So any man who wants to,
any man who wants to be a women's MMA

1912
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,670
fighter,
we're just going to basically give him a

1913
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,710
gold line pathway to the championship
because nobody's going to a woman's

1914
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:28,480
gonna wanna get in a ring with him and
have her jaw broken.

1915
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,950
That's not okay.
I think,

1916
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:31,750
you know,
it's perfectly reasonable to say if you

1917
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:34,180
weren't born a woman,
you don't get to fight in a women's

1918
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,850
competition.
I think that's perfectly reasonable,

1919
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,370
perfectly reasonable.
And uh,

1920
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:42,830
objective.
There's the in scientifically valid too,

1921
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,760
but there's a science behind you and I
both on the wrong side of,

1922
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,150
of popular opinion on this one.
We're not,

1923
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,460
well,
I know we often,

1924
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,600
no,
not what ordinary people think,

1925
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,850
but the media,
the media and political establishment of

1926
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:56,830
made up their minds on this and it's,
it's gone.

1927
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,750
It's gone.
How did the writing this real

1928
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,340
interesting that right gets this wrong
so it gets this wrong everyday.

1929
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,480
The reason I win,
I think there's no repercussions in

1930
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:07,300
supporting it.
That's why there's no repercussions in

1931
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:08,021
supporting,
well,

1932
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:10,660
they're all trans gender to be,
we ought to,

1933
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:11,494
I mean,
look,

1934
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,313
you know what?
I'm saying to me,

1935
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:14,980
[inaudible],
it's a woman.

1936
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,200
Get over it.
She should be able to fight men.

1937
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:20,320
There's no repercussions.
But if you say you're out of your

1938
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:24,130
fucking mind and because you're always
going to self determination and all the

1939
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:24,964
rest of it.
Yes,

1940
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,600
no that's true.
But that is entirely a construction of

1941
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:31,450
the left,
entirely construction to the left,

1942
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,770
the aggressive,
progressive,

1943
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:34,060
aggressive,
progressive and you know,

1944
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,670
and these people who you just missed
earlier is fringe nutcases.

1945
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:39,670
They have entirely dictated what you
were allowed to say on that subject.

1946
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,500
And if you don't say the right thing for
now,

1947
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,730
what I think,
I think it goes like this and then it

1948
01:15:45,731 --> 01:15:46,440
comes back.

1949
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,090
No,
right now it's come and give me an

1950
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,670
example of us.
Give an example of what's come back back

1951
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:55,090
right now to progressive fuel.
Progressive's have one,

1952
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:59,870
a um,
a society aren't women shit often

1953
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,060
listen,
does progressives,

1954
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,430
they won gay marriage.
They will.

1955
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,780
They will,
absolutely do you don't,

1956
01:16:10,781 --> 01:16:12,490
you don't think,
you don't think gay marriage is good

1957
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:14,290
cause you don't want to get married.
Do you want to have an excuse?

1958
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,220
Well just around town.
Yeah.

1959
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:19,270
Okay.
That's what it is.

1960
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,270
I don't want engaged.
I don't want gays to become,

1961
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:24,160
so Bosch,
we sell to be judging judged by other

1962
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:26,530
people's standards,
but being born gay's not fun.

1963
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:28,180
And if you have to be gay,
if you have to,

1964
01:16:28,181 --> 01:16:30,290
you know,
Jesse Anal sitting there,

1965
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,410
we'll look.
I'm having a wonderful time.

1966
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:35,200
You know I love me.
I am a note stretch of the imagination,

1967
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:35,800
self loathing.

1968
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,750
I'm very happy with who I am.
So how very English my sex life.

1969
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,410
Well,
because it hasn't been an easy road.

1970
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:46,090
This now rather be gay or be that Fat
lady from Kentucky that won't marry gay

1971
01:16:46,091 --> 01:16:47,530
people.
Kim Davis.

1972
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:48,950
Yes.
Who would you rather they be?

1973
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:50,800
Okay.
Just got fucked over.

1974
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:54,550
Way Worse than you'll Kim Davis.
The Shit is God damn genetic.

1975
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:56,340
Roll the dice possible.
Not a difficult,

1976
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,700
difficult thing to southern fucking
blotchy skin.

1977
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:02,560
If I were heterosexually wouldn't be Kim
Davis,

1978
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:05,230
so be Kim Kardashian.
I doubt it.

1979
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:10,130
Not if you were born in her life and
lived her life fucking body

1980
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,350
and that I have the actionetics fucking
snake.

1981
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,050
I've probably had sex with more black
men.

1982
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:17,890
This their entire family.
Nay guys,

1983
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:19,160
I don't know.
I don't think she's hot.

1984
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,160
Listen,
I'm going to call Dash Dashlane.

1985
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,660
I wish I was stupid.
I could have been such a great like

1986
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,583
Bimbo.
I would've,

1987
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:25,910
I would've been so good.
You think so?

1988
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,620
I would have been so good at it.
I don't think so.

1989
01:17:27,621 --> 01:17:30,140
Intelligence has been coast.
I don't think you're ruthless enough.

1990
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:32,750
Maybe kind have a nice guy.
He's a secret thing.

1991
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:35,600
I didn't like you think too much.
And it's also,

1992
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:38,390
you're like contemplating things and
even though you make rash

1993
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:42,110
generalizations,
obviously well studied each individual

1994
01:17:42,111 --> 01:17:44,510
issue in general.
Attorney get picker,

1995
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,620
Riri nitpicking.
This is it.

1996
01:17:48,621 --> 01:17:50,440
Now I'm changing it on my phone.
Thank you.

1997
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,990
I like,
you know,

1998
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,900
I think we see a lot of these things.

1999
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,110
I think we have a lot of ideas in common
a lot.

2000
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:03,230
Um,
I think that I'm trying to stick up for

2001
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:05,230
men even though you agree with me,
just to go from that

2002
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,230
stopping pussies,
that stuff.

2003
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,500
The reality is it's not that easy.
Exactly.

2004
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:16,430
That's why some people rise to the top
and most don't because it's not easy.

2005
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,750
Cool.
Get out of the bed and get your fucking

2006
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:23,600
shit.
I am the biggest meritocratic you will

2007
01:18:23,601 --> 01:18:26,540
ever meet.
You can keep just holding on and let

2008
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:29,260
anybody tell you you can't.
God dammit.

2009
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,750
That's what we don't.
You don't need to have your handheld and

2010
01:18:31,751 --> 01:18:34,250
laws changed and we need to make it safe
for,

2011
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,860
for men,
for men space.

2012
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:41,450
We met in this country being ignored by
women and we have to put a stop to that.

2013
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,310
We not gonna.
They're not attractive.

2014
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,510
Why are they not attractive?

2015
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,030
Because women are smart.
They know these guys are pussies.

2016
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:51,350
They don't want this pussy shooting up
fucking disease load inside of them and

2017
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:53,870
making some dump fucking kid that they
have to raise.

2018
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:56,720
They don't want it so they reject these
fools.

2019
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:01,240
These fools are there because you can
get me on a little styrofoam plate and a

2020
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:04,220
fucking supermarket.
It's too easy to buy milk.

2021
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:07,580
It's too easy to get your vegetables.
You don't have to do a goddamn thing.

2022
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:09,620
It's easy.
That's why.

2023
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:13,220
That's why these guys are pussies
because the world is soft.

2024
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,950
They're like lottery winners.
You ever met a lottery winner?

2025
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,860
They never keep their money because it's
too fucking easy.

2026
01:19:18,861 --> 01:19:21,830
They don't appreciate it.
And these guys that have gotten through

2027
01:19:21,831 --> 01:19:25,520
this shitty,
dull gray life

2028
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:32,320
cause they don't like you.
You don't even like you become someone,

2029
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,920
somebody with like you.
Fuck.

2030
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,770
That's the solution.
It's not changed the laws or get on the

2031
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:40,760
top of a mountain with a torch.
We have to stop these women from ruining

2032
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:42,740
these men look at them and they're
running away.

2033
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,740
They're running away to be by themselves
because the women won't have them

2034
01:19:45,741 --> 01:19:47,240
anymore.
Cool.

2035
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,670
Well they don't even like themselves.

2036
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,770
You gotta understand dude,
I'm with you on a lot of this.

2037
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:56,570
Okay?
Don't stick up for pussies.

2038
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,780
It's not good for them.
It's not good for anybody.

2039
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:03,320
I want them to have self confidence.
I want to work out the way we do it.

2040
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,680
Hold their hand.
Fucking let them cry and your sh you're

2041
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,690
expensive suit.
I think

2042
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I wouldn't let them near it
is that great line in the lost world.

2043
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:16,350
A second Jurassic Park movie.
It's like careful the suit cost more

2044
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:19,920
than your education.
I'm not a big fan of the military.

2045
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:23,100
I'm not a big fan of like people I care
about love joining the army,

2046
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:26,400
going over and killing people overseas
unless it's absolutely necessary of

2047
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:27,940
course.
But uh,

2048
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:31,170
I'm a big fan of,
I think a lot of people would benefit

2049
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:35,640
from fucking boot camp.
I think I agree with you and I might not

2050
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:38,910
be such a fucking pansy if we'd had it
comfortable,

2051
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,050
goddammit.
No,

2052
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:40,711
I mean like,
you know,

2053
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:43,020
if if I'd been through bootcamp,
I might not chosen to be gay.

2054
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,420
Um,
watts,

2055
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,500
that's probably been the number one
spot.

2056
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,820
I think more people are and bootcamp
than anywhere you go.

2057
01:20:49,821 --> 01:20:53,460
Now he gets to roll.
My whole fucking 30 guys are all

2058
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:54,210
together.

2059
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:56,910
You don't think a few months off and I
let at school.

2060
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,190
So that's what I'm saying.
I was working my way through the cricket

2061
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:00,480
team,
especially when they're on a boat.

2062
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,130
We didn't have a lot of navy,
almost would have been there.

2063
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,920
Um,
yeah.

2064
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:06,390
Yeah.
The navy week isn't it?

2065
01:21:06,391 --> 01:21:09,450
Was it like black guys?
That was the joke was the cricket.

2066
01:21:09,451 --> 01:21:10,710
You get some Indian dudes,
right?

2067
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:14,270
They're pretty good at cricket.
Indian dude's sorry.

2068
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,870
Huh?
Too much curry.

2069
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,000
No,
smells the look,

2070
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:20,010
you're not allowed to say that.
He knows all that to say that,

2071
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:20,311
but that,
you know,

2072
01:21:20,311 --> 01:21:21,480
it's not,
it's not a race thing.

2073
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:24,430
It's not a race thing,
but there's a certain diet like in a Oh

2074
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,790
duck goalie,
Bangladeshis ever certain Diane it gives

2075
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:29,640
us,
it's a very older three particular,

2076
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:32,120
um,
and I can say this is somebody who's

2077
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,150
banged a lot of Asian guys.

2078
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,221
Um,
you know,

2079
01:21:34,221 --> 01:21:36,150
there's a very particular odor to like
Bengalis Topanga,

2080
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,920
Deschutes,
the kind of food data's pretty heavily

2081
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:41,790
spiced fish that can stuff that's
actually those people as Asia.

2082
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:44,270
That's interesting because yeah,
we call the major weak automations and

2083
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:45,270
stuff.
But you know,

2084
01:21:45,271 --> 01:21:47,100
it's the same with,
I don't know whether it's a race there.

2085
01:21:47,101 --> 01:21:51,210
Mike Cleaner is a Ghanian Mike made is
like a Ghanaian.

2086
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:56,570
I'm Muslim and I'm such a good person.
Ghanaian Ghanian from gone.

2087
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,583
Gone it.
Yeah.

2088
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,350
I'm really good person,
so I let her keep her on in my house and

2089
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:02,670
stuff,
even though it's a bit like kind of just

2090
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:05,670
a bit terrifying just so she reads a
crime and you're your man and she's

2091
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,630
praying and I'm like,
I hope I'm not telling him making bacon.

2092
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,030
You're paying for this.
Um,

2093
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,190
no,
but why quite often do during Ramadan is

2094
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:14,100
like is I reheat last night's KFC,
um,

2095
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:14,970
just to talk to her.

2096
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,740
Um,
but no,

2097
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:17,431
I,
you know,

2098
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:18,270
Shit.
But she,

2099
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,570
you know,
she has a very pungent aroma and I'm

2100
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:22,261
sure it's,
I don't,

2101
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:23,760
I don't know.
Is that a race thing or you were even

2102
01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:24,980
allowed to say that he liked,
well,

2103
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:28,830
you're not supposed to be really on you.
It's like saying men are different from

2104
01:22:28,831 --> 01:22:29,820
women.
You're not really supposed to say any

2105
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:30,151
more.
But no,

2106
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:31,650
there is,
there is a certain,

2107
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,690
I mean I quite like it and I like those
guys.

2108
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:35,640
I'm always asking if she's got hot suns
and she would never tell me.

2109
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:38,650
I'm wondering why I quite like it,
but the area.

2110
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:40,410
But there is definitely that.
I mean like if she's,

2111
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:43,020
if she's been in and she's been mopping
and whatever,

2112
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:45,720
you can smile and like two hours later
and I come home,

2113
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:47,070
I know she's been there.
Wow.

2114
01:22:47,071 --> 01:22:48,420
That's bizarre.
You're like a wolf.

2115
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:51,100
Did you have really good,
I do have a really good sense of smell

2116
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,740
actually.
That's weird for a gay guy.

2117
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:55,110
Why?
Because I would think dude smell like

2118
01:22:55,111 --> 01:22:57,510
shit.
No like stinky.

2119
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,800
I would think that would be like,
like they put flowers,

2120
01:23:00,801 --> 01:23:02,880
hours,
perfume and women quite like how men

2121
01:23:02,881 --> 01:23:03,960
smells.
He imagined men into men.

2122
01:23:03,961 --> 01:23:05,290
They quite like it.
Oh okay.

2123
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,280
That does.
Yeah.

2124
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,060
So some guys like be,
oh yeah,

2125
01:23:09,061 --> 01:23:11,170
some guys smell bad.
I perspire quite a lot,

2126
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:13,140
but I don't smell like I,
I if,

2127
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:15,760
if I get,
I get sort of grotesque,

2128
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:17,950
but let's change the subject.
There's,

2129
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:21,490
I know women that like the way dude
stink when they get back from the gym.

2130
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:23,680
No,
I quite like fucking stay quite like

2131
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:28,681
they like it dirty bitches dirty.
I would be such a such a whore.

2132
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:29,590
Right?
Well,

2133
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,470
you know,
there was a bus,

2134
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:33,190
there was a study such a slot.

2135
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,070
I'd be pregnant at 12 I would have had
so many abortions by now.

2136
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,310
Wow.
There was a university of Rome,

2137
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:41,980
I believe,
did a study on homosexuality and they

2138
01:23:41,981 --> 01:23:45,980
had a theory that the reason why,
um,

2139
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,750
people became gay was a variation on the
x chromosome.

2140
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,780
And so because there was a
disproportionate amount of homosexual

2141
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:56,530
men that were birthed from women that
were promiscuous,

2142
01:23:56,790 --> 01:24:00,490
so just exceeding how terrible women
are.

2143
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:03,730
I think some men just see it,
see it really early and think that is so

2144
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:06,160
much crazy just to like,
just to come in something.

2145
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:07,140
I have to deal with that.
No,

2146
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:08,170
thank you.
I'm gonna go with boys.

2147
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:11,440
That's so ridiculous.
I'm coming to you as a straight man and

2148
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:13,350
you're talking nonsense for the most
part.

2149
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:15,160
Great.
I went gay to get it.

2150
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:17,200
My mother.
That's how it's revenge.

2151
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,240
I'm kind of a revenge homosexual.

2152
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:21,010
Like a wall.
Like a werewolf.

2153
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,400
Is that a convertible?
Yeah.

2154
01:24:22,401 --> 01:24:23,590
Well,
you'd be like the full moon.

2155
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,060
Your mother turned you right?
Yeah.

2156
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:27,100
Yeah.
It's tired.

2157
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,390
Yeah.
No.

2158
01:24:28,391 --> 01:24:31,870
So I went and because it wasn't
sufficiently scandalous that I lost my

2159
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:33,850
virginity in a interracial five,
some of the drag Queen,

2160
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,270
um,
that's not enough.

2161
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,890
I know.
So I started probably,

2162
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,440
I started bringing him,
they're like 13,

2163
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:40,840
maybe 13,
drag queens,

2164
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:42,320
interracial drive,
some five.

2165
01:24:42,321 --> 01:24:42,941
So yeah,
it was grass.

2166
01:24:42,941 --> 01:24:44,380
The first one.
Yeah.

2167
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,800
Well I was just fucked for life until
you get gone.

2168
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:48,941
Uh,
no.

2169
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:51,160
So I switched my home black boys
instead.

2170
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,620
And that she was upset about,
um,

2171
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,490
she just,
was it a racial thing that she was just

2172
01:24:57,491 --> 01:24:59,470
coming down and they was just these
black guys with like,

2173
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:02,260
you know,
with like cocaine and pills out on the

2174
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:05,200
breakfast table at 7:00 AM 14.

2175
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,970
Yeah.
I think people would have a problem with

2176
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:09,760
that whole,
the black guys a couple of years older,

2177
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,350
not a hugely alto.
And they went to,

2178
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,550
they went to the bad schools.
I mean,

2179
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:15,520
what's the go down cool.
Baddies can,

2180
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:18,280
we didn't have black people in my school
blow and fucking their son.

2181
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:20,740
Um,
so yeah,

2182
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:21,190
no,
and then,

2183
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,480
and then it just,
and then it just sort of,

2184
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:25,180
I just got stuck in a row and now it's
kind of a bad habit.

2185
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,400
But you know,
I wrote a column about this like I'm so

2186
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:29,650
bored of being gay and everybody took it
as a joke.

2187
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,880
It's actually one of my serious things
will ever,

2188
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:31,930
ever written.
Um,

2189
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,020
I'm only really attracted to things that
are transgressive that are naughty.

2190
01:25:35,021 --> 01:25:35,970
And I talked,
you spoke about this earlier,

2191
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,720
like I like dangerous,
difficult people.

2192
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,490
I only really sexually excited by things
that are forbidden and now gay people

2193
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:46,810
are endlessly Molly cuddles and
flattered and sucked up to in society is

2194
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:49,000
kind of the sexist lost its luster for
me.

2195
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:53,950
I'm thinking,
I think I thinking that I might go

2196
01:25:53,951 --> 01:25:55,860
heterosexual,
I might,

2197
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:59,040
I might do something that's going to
take you think I might do some things.

2198
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:03,220
I might do something that you know is
going to invite ridicule and criticism

2199
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,390
and he's going to make given me a more
difficult life.

2200
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:07,760
I might become a straight white male
with all due respect.

2201
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:12,110
I think you'll find it very difficult to
find suitors that are worthy of your

2202
01:26:12,111 --> 01:26:14,840
appearance with us.
If you're a woman,

2203
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:19,841
you can dance back and forth through
those worlds with little to no worries.

2204
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,540
Women who's in full words all the time,
suck a few Cox,

2205
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,670
take some deck and get fucked by five
guys.

2206
01:26:28,671 --> 01:26:31,700
One of them's a drag queen.
He tells stories,

2207
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:33,950
code black guys,
fuck you Nigga.

2208
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:37,470
Fuck fuck.
They're going to think about that.

2209
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:39,590
Worry them.
Yeah,

2210
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:40,220
they're just going to go.

2211
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,170
This guy is just to guy.
I just can't just,

2212
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,580
you can't trust him.
He love me.

2213
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:45,890
Like I'm surrounded by women all the
time in a friendly way.

2214
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,970
They were a friend,
but because that's what you are,

2215
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,460
but they'd let me do you understand the
difference?

2216
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:55,430
Let me fuck some of them.
But which those are the ones that would

2217
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:56,640
let you fuck them.
No,

2218
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,620
you know what I'm saying?
I ain't trying to be nice to your

2219
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:01,870
friends.
Wait ones.

2220
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,740
It'll let you fuck him.
You don't want to fuck.

2221
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:04,880
No,
you're probably right.

2222
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,100
Trust.
Make sure the hot ones being that

2223
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:08,510
friend,
they're going to fuck a guy who,

2224
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:09,560
uh,
never,

2225
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,380
never had a doubt.
So it's true.

2226
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:14,660
So I'm going to get really bad,
a bad quality of woman.

2227
01:27:14,661 --> 01:27:17,090
If I go straight,
stick with the black dudes.

2228
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,500
When we got,
she got an animals or something,

2229
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:19,810
become a nicker file.

2230
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:22,490
Now I transgender really flipped a
switch.

2231
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:24,530
It could be a trainee,
I think such a pretty girl.

2232
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,820
Yeah,
but you got to keep it just in case,

2233
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:32,080
you know,
she and I would throw my toys out,

2234
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:36,650
the prop Z or z or my pronouns are like,
here,

2235
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:38,300
here,
here,

2236
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,430
here.
My pronouns are.

2237
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:43,220
Fuck you motherfucker.
It's amazing.

2238
01:27:43,221 --> 01:27:45,860
The new pronouns,
Harvard University is trying to get

2239
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:48,320
people to use these new pronouns.
I mean,

2240
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:51,890
you're winning on this so sided.
Never transition just to antagonize

2241
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:52,940
people because they'd be like,
yeah,

2242
01:27:52,941 --> 01:27:53,990
I still got to take,
we still gotta call me.

2243
01:27:53,991 --> 01:27:55,010
She,
um,

2244
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,180
that's the move,
right?

2245
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:59,180
Say I'm a woman or wait until I'm in
trouble.

2246
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:01,040
I'm gonna pull,
I'm gonna pull a Bradley Manning.

2247
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,480
I'm going to wait until I get in
trouble.

2248
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:06,470
And then to elicit sympathy from idiots.
I'm going to go trends.

2249
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:08,780
Are you trying to say that that's a
Bradley Manny did.

2250
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:10,730
How dare you,
you would never make that application.

2251
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,050
Chelsea Manning,
by the way,

2252
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:14,440
gender week.
I missed [inaudible].

2253
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:17,000
I still called Bruce Bruce.
What?

2254
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:19,190
Of course you do.
60 years as he had it.

2255
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,160
I Dunno.
I'm not even going to be nicer.

2256
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,120
You fuck to dude.
Well,

2257
01:28:23,121 --> 01:28:23,840
yeah,
you're right.

2258
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,930
It should.
It shouldn't be a women's company.

2259
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,980
Doosan,
it's amazing stuff.

2260
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:32,130
Amazing media.
Now Caitlyn Jenner won the men's hundred

2261
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,610
repeaters like stuff.
Now this,

2262
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:38,480
is that what they're saying now when she
wanted the correct way to describe,

2263
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:39,560
uh,
his,

2264
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,930
his or her accomplishments as an
athlete,

2265
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:46,400
the technically correct way to do it is
to use the new name and the past

2266
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:49,130
accomplishments.
She won the men's whatever.

2267
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:52,090
I don't even know what's kind of
supposed to be one of the guys he

2268
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:57,380
competed in the Olympics with believes
that this whole transition to him

2269
01:28:57,381 --> 01:29:01,620
becoming a woman had to do with taking
steroids for the Olympics after he got

2270
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:02,670
off the steroids.

2271
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:04,111
Oh,
for sure.

2272
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:05,880
That's a big mean.
If you live in that family,

2273
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:07,810
if you live in the Kardashian family,
you know,

2274
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:11,160
it is a war of attention seeking.
And this is attention seeking something.

2275
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:12,650
I understand,
you know,

2276
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:16,230
and they're constantly trying to one up
one up each other and everyone thinks

2277
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:18,150
Kim's got the lead and everyone,
you know,

2278
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,860
and everyone thinks,
I'll go Kim.

2279
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,750
And then Bruce comes out and says,
well,

2280
01:29:21,751 --> 01:29:23,790
the nuclear bomb,
I got one for you,

2281
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,460
drops the fucking atomic,
but the neutron bomb,

2282
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:29,830
whatever,
you're a weapon of mass destruction,

2283
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,180
analogy of choices,
uh,

2284
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,180
drops this bomb.
It's like,

2285
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:34,043
Oh yeah,
I can,

2286
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,880
I want to get vanity fair.
Yeah,

2287
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:37,200
watch this shit.
I shit.

2288
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:42,150
Nobody cared about him at all for the
decade.

2289
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:44,820
It was on the show.
Who was the whipping boy show?

2290
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:46,590
And he got so sick of it.
It was like,

2291
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:48,570
I really,
really need some tension.

2292
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:50,220
I live in the cabinets,
is a Kardashian family.

2293
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:54,340
I've got to do something.
But I also think that he probably came

2294
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,890
as a slot.
Chloe's fat.

2295
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,740
Kim's a slut.
She's married with children.

2296
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:00,510
Sir.
I wasn't a judgment.

2297
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,171
Trust me.
I mean,

2298
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:02,490
I identified with her,
I told you about,

2299
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,290
you know,
Kim's a slot,

2300
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:05,470
Chloe's flat.
Okay.

2301
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:06,600
Calories,
fat.

2302
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,890
And Bruce is a woman,
you know,

2303
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:10,050
it's like they all have something,
right?

2304
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,730
Well,
he certainly does now.

2305
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:14,970
I mean,
he may not have it anymore when with his

2306
01:30:14,971 --> 01:30:18,300
face at the very least,
he turns his face into a woman's face.

2307
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:18,901
And you know,
I love it.

2308
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:21,270
I was trying to send it to me.
I want to make a serious point about

2309
01:30:21,271 --> 01:30:22,920
this section.
What I love about the transgender debate

2310
01:30:22,921 --> 01:30:25,080
is how damaging it is to feminism.
Um,

2311
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:25,610
trying to,
hold on.

2312
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:26,351
It's about,
actually,

2313
01:30:26,351 --> 01:30:27,600
it was my original point,
right?

2314
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:28,500
This is where you were going to go,
isn't it?

2315
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:30,573
There's something that feminine,

2316
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:33,990
we say about transgender,
particularly the male to female

2317
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:37,080
transgender is why do they always choose
such classically feminine

2318
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:39,180
looks?
Why don't they become what we want,

2319
01:30:39,181 --> 01:30:43,920
which is a sort of genderless fat blue
head on pip hell brigade.

2320
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:46,890
Like if you're going to go trends,
what they want is for you to cut,

2321
01:30:46,891 --> 01:30:48,870
become kinda queer.
They want you to become,

2322
01:30:48,871 --> 01:30:50,690
you know,
blue allergic,

2323
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:55,740
Chris asexual disaster of a human being
rather toenail high heels,

2324
01:30:56,461 --> 01:30:59,340
people who've,
men who become women become women like

2325
01:30:59,341 --> 01:31:02,430
very stereotypically women.
And this is interesting because this is

2326
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:05,100
um,
this is a sort of physical manifestation

2327
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,450
of a psychological

2328
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,940
cool problem for feminism.
And it is this,

2329
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:12,290
if you accept that people can be born
with the wrong brain,

2330
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,110
that a man can be born with a woman's
brain or a woman can be worn with a

2331
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:18,650
man's brain.
That goes a long way to destroying 40

2332
01:31:18,651 --> 01:31:20,690
years of gender politics and gender
theory,

2333
01:31:20,691 --> 01:31:23,810
which says that all sexuality and all
gender is socially constructed.

2334
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:27,200
Then that's why men behave like men do.
And women behave like women do.

2335
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:32,210
If you accept and you put on the cover
of Time magazine in or Vanity Fair,

2336
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:37,550
a person who has had the wrong brain in
the wrong body and when they transition

2337
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:40,100
they take on new characteristics,
new forms of behavior on all the rest of

2338
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:42,380
it.
You are admitting that some of these

2339
01:31:42,381 --> 01:31:45,620
qualities are innate or biological,
that there is such a thing as a male

2340
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,240
brain.
And a female brain.

2341
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:50,150
This is something that feminists have
been denying for decades,

2342
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,840
and it is incredibly damaging to the,
to the feminist project,

2343
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:56,870
to the idea that everything is cool
because when I want to break down the

2344
01:31:56,871 --> 01:31:59,110
gaps between men and women,
they want to make girls play with

2345
01:31:59,111 --> 01:32:01,210
action,
man and boys or just boys up as

2346
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:04,330
princesses.
What they're suggesting is the all

2347
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:07,450
gender is taught that it's a social
construct that we teach boys how to be

2348
01:32:07,451 --> 01:32:09,190
boys.
So we should teach boys to,

2349
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,050
you know,
be nice instead of violent.

2350
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,610
You know,
and this is toxic masculinity thing.

2351
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:15,670
Well,
what transgenderism demonstrates quite

2352
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:18,940
clearly if we accept it as face value as
progressive's us too,

2353
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:21,100
is that there is indeed such a thing as
a male brain.

2354
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,750
And there is indeed such a thing as a
female brain,

2355
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,190
um,
that being the case,

2356
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,360
ordinary people have them too.

2357
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,860
Uh,
and that explains why,

2358
01:32:26,861 --> 01:32:28,510
for example,
there aren't as many women in stem

2359
01:32:28,511 --> 01:32:30,190
subjects.
It explains why men have certain

2360
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:31,420
behavioral characteristics,
you know,

2361
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,270
and all of this stuff that feminists
have been telling us is just society and

2362
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:36,170
Patriarchy and conditioning.
Hmm.

2363
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,770
Hang on a minute.
You can't hold these two beliefs

2364
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,260
simultaneously.
You cannot believe both of these things

2365
01:32:41,261 --> 01:32:42,670
in tandem.
You have to pick one.

2366
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:43,661
And this is,
you know,

2367
01:32:43,661 --> 01:32:47,110
the reason that some people on the quiet
acquaintances Yaz to get a on the

2368
01:32:47,111 --> 01:32:50,200
political right and quite enthusiastic
about the transgender thing is they know

2369
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:55,260
it unravels the feminist project and it
unravels two generations of crazy

2370
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:58,810
progressive feminism in one fell swoop
because it demonstrates,

2371
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,360
um,
by their own admission what total

2372
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:04,090
bollocks.
The idea of constructed gender as well.

2373
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:07,690
It certainly is fascinating when you
watch people being celebrated for

2374
01:33:07,691 --> 01:33:09,760
traditional feminine appearances.

2375
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:13,270
Absolutely traditional accepted feminine
appearances dresses,

2376
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,490
but they would kill to be fat blue.
How,

2377
01:33:15,491 --> 01:33:16,540
you know,
that's what they're showing me.

2378
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:19,270
That's the most durable.
They won't have to be ugly like they are

2379
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,680
Trans America.
The cover,

2380
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,640
the vanity fair,
was it Vanity Fair or New Yorker?

2381
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:28,650
Whichever one they want her to be ugly.
Like they are ugly and they are ugly,

2382
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:31,540
which is why they became feminist in the
first place.

2383
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:32,820
There are gauges why they're left wing
it.

2384
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:35,830
My favorite feminist are the ones that
will never accept transcend

2385
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:36,780
transgenders.
Oh,

2386
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:37,960
the tests.
Yes.

2387
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:40,210
I love them too.
It's a tough,

2388
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:41,950
this,
this woman I told you about,

2389
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:43,720
the concentration camp woman,
she's a tough,

2390
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,580
I think all she,
she's accused of being a tough,

2391
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,520
these people who say that I'm
transgender women or not women,

2392
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,500
uh,
because they haven't had a woman's lived

2393
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:51,350
experience.
In fact,

2394
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:54,820
all they're doing is acquiring the
victim hood mantle by which they sort of

2395
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:56,260
admit the whole Jake,
you know,

2396
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:58,020
in the courts of this,
in order to be a turf,

2397
01:33:58,030 --> 01:34:00,950
you have to sort of admit that there's
such thing as a female privilege and

2398
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,070
what they're basically saying it as a
transgender person,

2399
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:05,560
you can never acquire the full degree of
female privilege.

2400
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:07,720
Yeah.
Because you can't claim your oppressed

2401
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:10,810
victimhood status and get special
dispensation or you can't do any of

2402
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:11,970
those things because you're not a real
woman.

2403
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:13,780
You never had a woman's experience.
We don't want you,

2404
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:16,000
I love them.
I love them because they're just the

2405
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:18,370
most brilliant example of let's just
dysfunctional,

2406
01:34:18,371 --> 01:34:19,810
fucked up,
left on left violence.

2407
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:22,270
It's wonderful.
Or this sort of house of cards of

2408
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:24,650
ludicrous theory that's totally
internally inconsistent.

2409
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,680
This is one of these,
the one of those times in which it just

2410
01:34:26,681 --> 01:34:29,860
implodes,
that stuff's accelerated and they're

2411
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,590
eating themselves at a staggering rate.
When I wrote about this,

2412
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:34,420
I wrote about this in a,
in another great piece that you're,

2413
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:36,190
oh,
what's it called?

2414
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,490
It's called minority wars.
And my point in this was that,

2415
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:40,301
um,
in the last,

2416
01:34:40,301 --> 01:34:42,940
if the last 10 years have been bit about
setting men against women and find,

2417
01:34:42,941 --> 01:34:45,850
you think men are just man the fuck up
and I know you're entitled to that view.

2418
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:46,601
Um,
I have,

2419
01:34:46,601 --> 01:34:49,150
I taken a slightly more compassionate
view of this stuff.

2420
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:50,710
Um,
if you,

2421
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:53,230
if you believe that the last 10 years,
I think most people do the progressive

2422
01:34:53,231 --> 01:34:55,150
project has been sister set women
against men.

2423
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,040
The next 10 years is going to be even
worse.

2424
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,010
The next 10 years is going to set

2425
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,870
sexuality against sexuality,
race against race,

2426
01:34:59,871 --> 01:35:01,120
gender against gender.
Um,

2427
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:03,470
so you're gonna get Hispanics versus
blacks in America is Hispanic.

2428
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:05,300
Hispanics for example.
Um,

2429
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,700
uh,
that's interesting because Hispanics

2430
01:35:07,701 --> 01:35:09,920
don't have the guilt about slavery that
white people do.

2431
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,530
So when Hispanics or running cities like
Baltimore,

2432
01:35:12,531 --> 01:35:14,970
the policing is going to be brutal.
It is getting,

2433
01:35:14,971 --> 01:35:16,430
you're never going to,
you will never see.

2434
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,040
You will never have seen anything like
it.

2435
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:19,911
Um,
what,

2436
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:22,130
what Hispanics,
Hispanics are going to be the going to

2437
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:24,920
be the demographic majority in this
country.

2438
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:27,660
They,
well,

2439
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:30,440
they don't have the same guilt.
They don't have the white guilt that

2440
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:32,420
allows black lives matter to flourish.
Right?

2441
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:34,820
They only reason black lives matter is a
thing is because of white guilt.

2442
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:38,450
You really think that you don't think
it's because of black people are getting

2443
01:35:38,451 --> 01:35:40,520
fed up,
that they see people getting shot for no

2444
01:35:40,521 --> 01:35:41,000
reason.

2445
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,140
They see.
It's definitely a pleasing,

2446
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:44,840
definitely placing form.
But you can swap being teasers on their

2447
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:47,450
body.
You can in the black people as indeed I

2448
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:49,530
do with my body and in many cases,
uh,

2449
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:52,160
and nonetheless not think the black
lives matter is the best thing for black

2450
01:35:52,161 --> 01:35:56,030
people with black lives matter.
Perpetuates a culture of victim hood,

2451
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,350
which is,
I want to do this.

2452
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:59,120
Not really black.
What's his name is Shaun King.

2453
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,890
Yeah,
he's still,

2454
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:02,540
you know,
Shaun King story is amazing.

2455
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,280
It's amazing.
This guy,

2456
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:08,090
and you know what,
he came back with this male Rachel came

2457
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:09,560
back with this blog posts.
You know,

2458
01:36:09,561 --> 01:36:11,120
it's another wonderful story of Brooke.
Um,

2459
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,170
he came out with this because you break
that story too.

2460
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:14,700
Of course I brought that story.
How dare you.

2461
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,470
Um,
I know I put that,

2462
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:20,480
um,
well actually you told me about that on

2463
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:21,260
Twitter.

2464
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:23,590
That's how I found out.
Um,

2465
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:24,711
so anyway,
uh,

2466
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:26,510
he,
he comes back after all this reporting

2467
01:36:26,511 --> 01:36:26,991
and says,
oh,

2468
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:27,790
well the man,
they're,

2469
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:31,070
they're right about everything except
the amount on my birth certificate is

2470
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:33,920
not my real dad.
My mum had an f like throws his mom

2471
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:36,140
under the bus because my mom was a slot
30 years ago.

2472
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:37,310
Effectively.
Um,

2473
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,820
and I'm not getting any more
interaction.

2474
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:42,320
Never asked about who my dad is.
I don't know anything about him.

2475
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,930
I've never lost in 30 years who my dad
is.

2476
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,131
Okay.
All right,

2477
01:36:46,131 --> 01:36:47,030
fine.
Carry on.

2478
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,040
The only thing I know about him for
absolute short,

2479
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,060
I didn't know his name.
I don't know who he is.

2480
01:36:50,061 --> 01:36:51,590
I don't know where he is.
The only thing I definitely know about

2481
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:54,960
him as if he was black,
isn't it possible DNA.

2482
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:55,720
Social.
Well,

2483
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,770
he really,
he didn't like,

2484
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,350
didn't acknowledge it was a black,
a black political,

2485
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:01,490
well this is what I was thinking.

2486
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:03,860
I was like kissing someone and get a
cup.

2487
01:37:03,861 --> 01:37:05,240
You know,
like they do in the movies where you

2488
01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:09,380
should put him on 23 and me.
But there was a black political action

2489
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:11,060
committee.
They said they'd give $25,000 a black

2490
01:37:11,061 --> 01:37:12,650
lives matter.
If he submits to do a DNA test,

2491
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:17,120
did he wouldn't do it at black political
action committee said put this to rest.

2492
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:19,430
We'll give $25,000 a black lives matter
and he wouldn't do it.

2493
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,670
So we're in the situation now.
I know these things.

2494
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:25,970
Tell me all I need to know now we're in
a situation with Shaun King has

2495
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:27,860
pronounced Shaun King innocent,
but you don't have to ask any more

2496
01:37:27,861 --> 01:37:29,300
questions and you just got to take his
word for it.

2497
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:29,841
Well,
sorry,

2498
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:31,420
I don't,
there's still going.

2499
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:34,250
The guy's white is still a big part of
black lives matter.

2500
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,173
Well,
he's one of the figureheads.

2501
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,940
I mean I think he's a thing like
couldn't you be white?

2502
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:40,700
And also think that black lives matter,
like the end

2503
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,240
piece is identity politics.
They didn't want you,

2504
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:45,740
they don't want you,
you,

2505
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:47,290
you have no village to speak on those
issues.

2506
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:48,040
It's like,
and I was just no,

2507
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:48,950
right.
Speak about feminism.

2508
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:49,761
Um,
you know,

2509
01:37:49,761 --> 01:37:51,710
this is,
this is why it's so damaging to black

2510
01:37:51,711 --> 01:37:52,730
lives matter.
The fact that,

2511
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:55,170
you know,
all of their figurehead seemed to end up

2512
01:37:55,171 --> 01:37:57,420
either being lunatics or being white.
What is,

2513
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:59,430
what was wrong with this movement that,
that no,

2514
01:37:59,431 --> 01:38:01,650
authentically black people seem to be
able to lead it.

2515
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,740
I'm like,
there must be this.

2516
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,620
Yes,
there's something wrong.

2517
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:06,300
What's wrong with them,
deray?

2518
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:08,760
Dude,
this is promising homosexual.

2519
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,000
How dare you.
I might be gay,

2520
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:17,001
but that's still it feel like he is.
He's just so odious and unbearable.

2521
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:18,420
And I loved also,
I loved,

2522
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:19,830
oh,
he's probably the most unlikable person

2523
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:21,180
in America that meets.
What's this?

2524
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:24,330
I don't think he is give these
interviews.

2525
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:27,060
I think he's intelligent and well
spoken.

2526
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:29,700
So nice about everyone except the men
that need you

2527
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,110
man up pussies,
pussies.

2528
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:37,060
But deray MCKESSON's great goal.
It's like what's wrong with you?

2529
01:38:37,061 --> 01:38:38,820
It seems like a great guy.
I mean,

2530
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:43,821
when I've heard him interviewed
me in a way they're put together with

2531
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:46,320
the bomb,
which were the only black person I w not

2532
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:48,060
sexually attracted to.
Wow.

2533
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,220
He,
you say this.

2534
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:51,503
What?
Well,

2535
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:52,480
I mean,
not like,

2536
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,290
I mean like I would,
but no,

2537
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:55,970
uh,
I,

2538
01:38:55,970 --> 01:39:00,090
I find him so what's wrong?
What are you sort of like sort of

2539
01:39:00,091 --> 01:39:01,920
preening comedy,
Homo,

2540
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,060
um,
you know,

2541
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:08,210
sort of prancing around in his ones is
that often it's just dreadful,

2542
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:11,040
but he's a product of this terrible
political assumption.

2543
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,910
You got to be black and gay in a rights
protester and another,

2544
01:39:13,930 --> 01:39:18,910
the black lives matter leaders is white.
And the NAA NAACP chapter heading and

2545
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:22,200
bought in the Washington in Spokane,
in Washington is white.

2546
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:24,840
And I'm thinking to myself,
she resigned on what's wrong with this

2547
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:25,561
movement?
No,

2548
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:27,450
she's still in place.
Or She just resigned from something's

2549
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:28,420
been all,
uh,

2550
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:31,230
I'm thinking to myself,
what's wrong with this movement that no

2551
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:32,670
black people see me?
We're able to lead it.

2552
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,550
And the reason is that this is,
as,

2553
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,250
this is fueled a source thing,
you know,

2554
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,120
it's fueled by,
um,

2555
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:40,260
white guilt and progressive liberal
establishment,

2556
01:39:40,261 --> 01:39:43,500
which is incredibly,
one could not exist without,

2557
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:47,640
but he's not a real black is
fuck,

2558
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,390
I don't know.
I just said it to annoy people.

2559
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,970
I'm getting like,
Twitter is going to be ridiculous now.

2560
01:39:53,971 --> 01:39:54,960
I don't even know what I mean by that.

2561
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:00,770
I guess I just don't like the idea that
black people can be homosexual.

2562
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:01,650
I liked,
I liked,

2563
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:04,070
I liked the idea that everybody's black
guys,

2564
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,530
the idea that I'm sort of talking them
out of their heterosexuality for one

2565
01:40:07,531 --> 01:40:08,660
night,
you know,

2566
01:40:08,661 --> 01:40:10,830
I just,
I think it's all about why I think it's

2567
01:40:10,831 --> 01:40:14,150
all about my sort of my doc rape fetish.
Um,

2568
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,270
oh,
I just don't know.

2569
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:16,104
I like,
I like just,

2570
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:19,200
I don't like the idea of black people as
homosexuals.

2571
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:22,710
It just feels wrong to me.
You got some fucking issues.

2572
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:24,540
No,
I just have preferences.

2573
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:25,403
I just,
you know,

2574
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,910
I like to imagine they're heterosexual.
Gonna have sex versus if you were

2575
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:34,550
involved in potential relationships to
these prophecies of heterosexual black

2576
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:38,550
west to pursue and which ones not to.
This is a man you don't even know.

2577
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:41,340
Oh,
he's an activist and you're like,

2578
01:40:41,341 --> 01:40:43,590
I just prefer him to not be gay.

2579
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:45,390
I have a real problem with him being
gay.

2580
01:40:45,391 --> 01:40:47,640
I have preferences problem with him
being gay.

2581
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:50,130
I just did it.
He's like gay people.

2582
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,233
No,
of course I don't.

2583
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:55,940
Of course I don't.
I love,

2584
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:59,320
I love Dick,
but I hate Larry.

2585
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:04,090
You like hanging out with my people,
all of their fucking Tutus and Madonna

2586
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:04,511
like,
okay,

2587
01:41:04,511 --> 01:41:05,344
look,
I have my notes.

2588
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:07,930
I have my moments with my moments with
Mariah Carey.

2589
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:09,580
But um,
but no,

2590
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:11,230
the way they behave,
the music they listened to,

2591
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:12,370
how they dress,
how they speak,

2592
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,570
and worst of all,
which really fucking annoys me.

2593
01:41:14,571 --> 01:41:18,310
It drives me absolutely crazy the way in
which gay people have now become such

2594
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:20,590
bullies.
They're using all the tools,

2595
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,820
um,
against other people or Christians,

2596
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,490
the bakeries,
all that kind of shit that used to be

2597
01:41:24,491 --> 01:41:26,950
used against them.
Gay people have become the worst kind of

2598
01:41:26,951 --> 01:41:30,730
sanctimonious bullies and it makes me
ashamed to be a homosexual when I see

2599
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:31,670
the way that they bully other.

2600
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,850
My other minorities,
the way they bully religious minorities.

2601
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:35,860
And I think 50 years ago,
this was gaze.

2602
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:37,320
When I see the way that gay people
brave,

2603
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:40,060
when I see that couple,
that gay couple who went to memories

2604
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:41,640
pizza memory speaks of your,
remember was the,

2605
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,310
was the Christian breaker you said?
You know,

2606
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:45,190
probably wouldn't.
We'd rather not Katie wedding if that's

2607
01:41:45,191 --> 01:41:47,860
okay because some,
some idiot,

2608
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:49,990
you know,
a troublemaker on the left had gone,

2609
01:41:49,991 --> 01:41:53,050
gone basically gone outrage shopping
called up everybody in Indiana.

2610
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:54,850
And so will your Keto when you came to
willow cater,

2611
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:57,640
finally found somebody who said,
I prefer not to anyway.

2612
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,760
Is that these days in question admitted
that he,

2613
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:06,220
well,
I think one of the question around are

2614
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:11,221
of going to one day nobody went there
and got turned down and humiliated by

2615
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:14,590
Evil Christians.
A liberal reporter went around shopping

2616
01:42:14,591 --> 01:42:16,000
for someone who said no they wouldn't.

2617
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:19,130
And it took them days to anyway,
just like sweet enrolling stays.

2618
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:22,300
She went rate shopping.
Sabrina Erdely admitted that she went

2619
01:42:22,301 --> 01:42:25,090
around looking for the most sensational
rape story possible.

2620
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,590
And of course it turned out to be
bullshit.

2621
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:29,440
But the [inaudible] hold on.
I'm don't mean to interrupt you,

2622
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:33,040
but I did not know that that was not an
actual story.

2623
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:34,090
The top,
by the way,

2624
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:36,740
it's cooked up by the media.
I thought it was a real gay couples.

2625
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,430
This is how I fell into it.
And you know,

2626
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,630
and you know what?
The real gay couple,

2627
01:42:40,631 --> 01:42:42,310
do you know what Real Cook Gay couples
are doing today?

2628
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,173
Well,
this is just,

2629
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,370
it just makes me so,
no,

2630
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,750
no,
they're not becoming Bosch while they're

2631
01:42:46,751 --> 01:42:49,330
getting a car and a kid and a pet.
And then know that not having,

2632
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:50,200
because tiny embers,
no,

2633
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,810
they're not all full.
I hate those kind of gaze,

2634
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:54,120
the most of all that terrible.

2635
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,580
My delegate,
you should be toppling out of a

2636
01:42:57,581 --> 01:43:01,150
nightclub off your tips,
off your tits on ketamine at 4:00 PM on

2637
01:43:01,151 --> 01:43:03,880
a Monday afternoon.
Call yourself a homosexual.

2638
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:09,300
You drive a golf like you know,
just stop her range rover but carry on.

2639
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:12,880
Get the kid to school by eight Oh no,
I've got to get back cause I've got

2640
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:16,030
bridge club at 10 just die.
Well he teaches spin class,

2641
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:24,100
crossfit cross soul cycle.
What kind of a self respecting gay

2642
01:43:24,101 --> 01:43:28,340
person does soul cycle or bad for you?
Oh Oh all cardio.

2643
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:33,350
Cardio's gay
sex and drugs.

2644
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:39,370
Like any other gay person,
crystal Meth and 12 hour fuck sessions

2645
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:44,650
and they stayed in in the 80s aids news.
Fantastic.

2646
01:43:44,651 --> 01:43:47,380
You know,
I'd love if I kind of do want it because

2647
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:49,540
is yeah,
because it's not a death sentence

2648
01:43:49,541 --> 01:43:51,500
anymore.
You can't dye your all the great drugs.

2649
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:52,040
But if

2650
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,750
you delay taking the drugs,
you get thin,

2651
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:56,370
you lose all your body fat,
you get so much attention or buyer

2652
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:58,100
dollars or the presence when I'm tired
all the time.

2653
01:43:58,101 --> 01:44:00,780
Now,
what's the different way more staff?

2654
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:04,460
You're talking so fast.
I don't buy the fact that you're tired

2655
01:44:04,461 --> 01:44:07,820
all the time.
It's hard to get a word in edge wise.

2656
01:44:07,821 --> 01:44:10,520
You're on fire.
I don't buy the title anyway exhausted.

2657
01:44:10,521 --> 01:44:12,740
Just going to finish them sores all over
your face.

2658
01:44:12,741 --> 01:44:13,940
You don't want that.
Actually that's not hot,

2659
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:16,430
but it's just the early stages.
But you know like the first,

2660
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,490
the first,
the first six months in the bowl or the

2661
01:44:19,491 --> 01:44:20,890
first six months of age,
fantastic.

2662
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:23,340
Lose all your body fade your shit all
the way out balls.

2663
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,840
You get sores all over your body.
First,

2664
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:28,490
first stage,
first gay couple this week.

2665
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:30,000
And then I promise I'm going to give
this subject up,

2666
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,750
but um,
gay couple this week decided to renew

2667
01:44:32,751 --> 01:44:35,270
them at renew their wedding vows.

2668
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:37,670
Right?
And they go to memories pizza and they

2669
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:39,920
pick up pizza and they stop parading
around on stage.

2670
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:42,510
How they got memories pizza or they were
doing those nasty Christians who don't

2671
01:44:42,511 --> 01:44:44,660
wanna cater gates.
And I thought to myself,

2672
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:46,970
and then the NATO sent these pictures of
the press or whatever,

2673
01:44:46,971 --> 01:44:48,410
and I thought said,
what a nasty,

2674
01:44:48,411 --> 01:44:49,880
vindictive,
bitter,

2675
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:54,881
soulless way to treat your own wedding
or your vowel renewal or whatever.

2676
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:59,630
Turn it into this triumphalist bitter
public political stumped.

2677
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:04,130
And I thought it was so cheap and so
classless and it represented everything

2678
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,690
that's wrong with the gay establishment
today.

2679
01:45:05,691 --> 01:45:07,700
And it was just,
I just saw that and I thought,

2680
01:45:07,701 --> 01:45:09,320
God,
I hope people don't think that about me

2681
01:45:09,321 --> 01:45:10,320
when they know I'm gay,
you know,

2682
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:11,510
um,
this,

2683
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:13,970
these preening bitter,
spiteful,

2684
01:45:13,971 --> 01:45:16,460
nasty queers.
And I thought to myself,

2685
01:45:16,461 --> 01:45:18,320
in my head,
you fucking idiots.

2686
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:21,590
Like you are doing so much damage to the
public view of homosexuality.

2687
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:23,550
You know,
making people think that [inaudible]

2688
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,180
spiteful,
bitter behavior is how we all behave

2689
01:45:26,181 --> 01:45:28,730
when we get a taste of power.
Because of course how we judge people.

2690
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,230
We judge,
one of the ways we judge people's,

2691
01:45:30,231 --> 01:45:33,560
how they behave when they're in power
and now gays or the establishment,

2692
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,420
you know,
acquiring gazer power,

2693
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:37,700
look at the disproportionate important,
you know,

2694
01:45:37,701 --> 01:45:39,350
a disproportionate numbers of
homosexuals in,

2695
01:45:39,351 --> 01:45:40,011
you know,
in employment,

2696
01:45:40,011 --> 01:45:42,260
in the media or whatever.
They're constantly fated and

2697
01:45:42,261 --> 01:45:45,020
mollycoddled and uh,
and celebrated and all of that is good.

2698
01:45:45,021 --> 01:45:47,180
Like the quality is great and you know,
all that's all that's important,

2699
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:50,930
but it's really telling how they behave
when they get to that position.

2700
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:54,470
See this aberration,
this one couple that you're talking

2701
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:56,810
about,
Kim Davis,

2702
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:59,050
the same thing.
The same thing happened to that other

2703
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,770
that they know that,
what is it like three or four bakeries

2704
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:03,920
and pizzerias in the u s now the same
thing's happening in Ireland,

2705
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:05,600
in England,
in,

2706
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:06,320
um,
you know,

2707
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,100
all over the place.

2708
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:10,370
Gays are becoming bullies and I don't
like seeing it.

2709
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:14,870
I think what's happening is it's you get
a bunch of people who are unhappy that

2710
01:46:14,871 --> 01:46:18,500
know that they can have an impact by
doing a something and they know they

2711
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:21,860
have a green while they're obviously on,
I wouldn't behave like this,

2712
01:46:21,861 --> 01:46:23,540
but what?
They don't do a something.

2713
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:27,470
Then they're giving you something as we
can protest in this fashion and we will

2714
01:46:27,471 --> 01:46:30,200
get a pop.
But they've been given carte blanche to

2715
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,240
go after religious minorities because
the,

2716
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:33,980
the media establishment,
politicians,

2717
01:46:33,981 --> 01:46:36,050
all the rest of it continually give the
signals.

2718
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,850
Are you on Kim Davis Society?
Is that what you're saying?

2719
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,240
I mean,
I don't look,

2720
01:46:40,241 --> 01:46:41,960
she can't,
she can't do the job right.

2721
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:43,850
She can't do the job.
So she probably shouldn't be in her

2722
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:46,160
posts cause she can't perform the
functions of her job,

2723
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:47,180
her beliefs.

2724
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:50,550
If she refuses to issue those licenses
and that is the law,

2725
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,380
right?
She can't be in her job.

2726
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:56,520
But you know what's interesting?
She's these days,

2727
01:46:56,580 --> 01:47:00,750
the example of a conscientious objector.
She's an example of somebody sticking up

2728
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:04,470
for their beliefs or their political
opinions or their life or their life

2729
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:07,260
choices or their faith or whatever in
the face of the law,

2730
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:10,080
in the face of public opinion.
And the face of,

2731
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:11,100
um,
you know,

2732
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:12,300
received wisdom,
the consensual,

2733
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:14,940
the rest of it.
She is doing what gate can rights

2734
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:18,360
campaigners were doing 50 years ago.
And I think it's very telling now.

2735
01:47:18,361 --> 01:47:20,220
Gay people are mollycoddled and
protected.

2736
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:21,570
And you know,
I've been a beneficiary of that.

2737
01:47:21,571 --> 01:47:22,930
I've seen it in action.
Um,

2738
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:27,540
the way that now they can turn around
and bully religious minorities solely to

2739
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:30,360
feel better about themselves in this
horrible bitter way that they do.

2740
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:32,700
Um,
and lesbians the worst by the way.

2741
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,670
Um,
the way they can now do that to people

2742
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:37,930
who have faith to religious people.
Um,

2743
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:40,950
makes me slightly feel slightly ill and
I'm really,

2744
01:47:41,110 --> 01:47:43,020
I really object to it.
Let's slow down.

2745
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:47,700
You're saying that she is doing what
what gay activists were doing 50 years

2746
01:47:47,701 --> 01:47:49,040
ago,
which is make brief stands.

2747
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:51,030
They get them in prison to get that go
against the law.

2748
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:56,031
Go against gay activists were never in a
position to alter other people's lives

2749
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:59,730
or deny them of a public service that's
on the books.

2750
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:02,840
See the problem,
which is that she used her own,

2751
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:06,810
she should've never been put in prison,
but you can't compare her to any form of

2752
01:48:06,811 --> 01:48:09,510
an act as you can.
How could you possibly do that?

2753
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,200
Because she's affecting other people's
lives that have nothing to do with me,

2754
01:48:13,201 --> 01:48:15,480
that she shouldn't be in her because she
can't do her job.

2755
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:20,370
While the entire time being guilty of
several sins,

2756
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,810
one of them,
the fact that she's being a demo course,

2757
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:28,490
the primary sin of a swinging,
switched out surprised after she still

2758
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:30,000
won't happen.

2759
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,780
This is how the Democrats treat their
own well,

2760
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:36,360
and the GOP came and supported and of
course the pneumococcal be flew in a

2761
01:48:36,361 --> 01:48:37,620
private jet.
Of course,

2762
01:48:37,621 --> 01:48:41,070
the New York Times accidentally
published that she was a Republican.

2763
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:42,990
Of course.
What a terrible Ms Democrat you mean?

2764
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:43,741
No,
no.

2765
01:48:43,741 --> 01:48:45,080
They published that.
She was a republican.

2766
01:48:45,081 --> 01:48:47,000
Well and there was a normal,
she was a democrat.

2767
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:52,000
It was guilt times.
Just assumed without checking what

2768
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:52,711
you're saying.
Oh,

2769
01:48:52,711 --> 01:48:55,570
I said they printed in the newspaper
that she was a republican because I was

2770
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:57,330
the New York Times did and then,
oh sorry.

2771
01:48:57,340 --> 01:48:58,920
Made a mistake about that.
And of course no one ever sees the

2772
01:48:58,921 --> 01:49:00,840
corrections.
So now every lesson that would fox news

2773
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:02,460
always does.
When someone does something creepy,

2774
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:06,980
they put d next to their name and find
out fair and balanced and they find out

2775
01:49:06,981 --> 01:49:08,790
all those really are Republican.
I know,

2776
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:10,400
I love Fox News.
I'm going to say a bad word about Fox

2777
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:14,790
was great.
I think that the gut is good friend

2778
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,870
nearly that the comparison is pretty
ridiculous to say that she is doing what

2779
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:21,390
gay activists were doing in the 1950s.

2780
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:22,780
Let's,
but,

2781
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:25,120
um,
from my point of view as somebody who is

2782
01:49:25,121 --> 01:49:27,050
both religious and homosexual,
um,

2783
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:28,720
your religious,
yeah,

2784
01:49:28,721 --> 01:49:29,554
well,
I mean I saw my,

2785
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:31,300
my match with nearly speaking,
I'm Jewish,

2786
01:49:31,301 --> 01:49:32,680
but I was raised Catholic.
Um,

2787
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:33,760
and um,

2788
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:39,010
so does that mean to you practicing in
the middle of ketamine on perfect fuck

2789
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:40,060
sessions?
Yes.

2790
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:42,640
Well that's not very religious.
Shoulder men in dresses.

2791
01:49:42,641 --> 01:49:47,641
What's not to love?
If it hadn't been for Michael,

2792
01:49:47,711 --> 01:49:48,010
I wouldn't have

2793
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,330
made nearly as much money in my
twenties.

2794
01:49:49,331 --> 01:49:50,710
He told me to get such good head,
you know,

2795
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:53,830
um,
I gave such good blow jobs off to after

2796
01:49:53,831 --> 01:49:55,270
three years in choir.
Um,

2797
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,051
no,
I mean,

2798
01:49:56,051 --> 01:49:58,810
um,
so you're not religious?

2799
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,310
No,
no.

2800
01:49:59,310 --> 01:50:01,480
I'm I believe I don't necessarily go to
mass all the time,

2801
01:50:01,481 --> 01:50:03,790
but
I'm a Catholic.

2802
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,850
We can call it would leave one myself a
catholic.

2803
01:50:05,851 --> 01:50:07,300
Yeah,
I'm going to know a good Catholic,

2804
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:08,830
but you know,
but when you say you believe,

2805
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:12,640
like you believe in what the Bible,
I believe in Catholicism.

2806
01:50:12,641 --> 01:50:12,981
I'm,
I'm,

2807
01:50:12,981 --> 01:50:13,960
I'm,
I'm a Catholic.

2808
01:50:13,961 --> 01:50:18,760
I think so you believe that it's a good
idea to have confession and you have a,

2809
01:50:18,761 --> 01:50:22,260
a dude who never had sex ever listen to
fuck stories whispered through.

2810
01:50:22,261 --> 01:50:26,140
Yeah.
Hole in the wall absorbs you cut baby

2811
01:50:26,141 --> 01:50:26,801
dicks,
you know,

2812
01:50:26,801 --> 01:50:31,600
for,
for for a is very nitpicky turn of dress

2813
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:33,820
like a wizard sitting on the golden
throne.

2814
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,511
Right?
We're done.

2815
01:50:34,511 --> 01:50:36,960
You have to cut down father.
That all make sense to you.

2816
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:38,000
You know,
want to Catholics.

2817
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:40,420
Well,
do you know what this world could do

2818
01:50:40,421 --> 01:50:43,000
with a bit more pomp and circumstance?
A little bit more a drama.

2819
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:46,000
And it could be the man who supports the
fucking matriarchy.

2820
01:50:46,001 --> 01:50:47,520
She knew what this work could do.
It could do with it.

2821
01:50:47,521 --> 01:50:48,490
A little bit more of that.
I mean,

2822
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:52,320
just look at that.
Look at the dreary hell of the atheist

2823
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:53,111
arts scene.
Look at,

2824
01:50:53,111 --> 01:50:53,621
you know,
look at this.

2825
01:50:53,621 --> 01:50:57,400
There's some total arts.
My contribution to human searching,

2826
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:01,180
the atheist arts I meet.
What I mean is,

2827
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:01,750
you know,
you still get,

2828
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:04,870
the atheists are seen.
Look at almost all the good movies ever

2829
01:51:04,871 --> 01:51:07,990
made.
Look at almost all the great albums ever

2830
01:51:07,991 --> 01:51:10,240
made.
Look at almost all the great convenient

2831
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:12,650
told jokes,
pay Hollywood,

2832
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,410
atheist,
some biznow.

2833
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:15,350
No,
none.

2834
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:20,320
Comics.
I like if you believe line comedians

2835
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:23,980
contributes to the sum total of human
civilization and knowledge in the way

2836
01:51:23,981 --> 01:51:27,370
that anyway,
that Michelangelo did.

2837
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,780
I mean Dars,
Oh yes,

2838
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:32,660
Gogh yesterday,
dreary,

2839
01:51:32,661 --> 01:51:34,120
awful,
boring herb,

2840
01:51:34,190 --> 01:51:35,610
dairy,
all of them that are atheists

2841
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:39,610
totally makes sense.
You need religion to be a good person,

2842
01:51:39,930 --> 01:51:42,040
but you especially need rich,
especially in the religion,

2843
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:44,860
to be a good artist,
you need to pick and choose what you do

2844
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:49,360
that you decide is religious and isn't
same as his Kim Davis lady deciding that

2845
01:51:49,361 --> 01:51:53,830
the sins of these men were more
important than their own sins or the or.

2846
01:51:53,831 --> 01:51:56,770
You.
Would you want to do ketamine and

2847
01:51:56,771 --> 01:52:01,771
amphetamines and have just speaking
purely here about five at the age of 13

2848
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:06,520
okay?
These are all not in the Bible all day.

2849
01:52:06,521 --> 01:52:08,810
You'll never find hat drag queen
fivesome.

2850
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:14,730
None of the minute
you got to go to the Old Testament.

2851
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,230
I think you know you're not.
You're looking at King James on you.

2852
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:17,650
You know,
if you,

2853
01:52:17,650 --> 01:52:18,950
if you actually chat,
look at Baltimore.

2854
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:22,960
It's right there in Leviticus.
I read her the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2855
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:25,950
Christian lie with interracial
crossdressing orgies.

2856
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:26,411
You know,
it's,

2857
01:52:26,411 --> 01:52:28,120
it's right there.
It's in my,

2858
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:29,950
yeah.
That's the thing though,

2859
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:31,000
isn't it?
Like if you,

2860
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:35,500
if you say you're Christian and you want
to be on that team to kind of say it

2861
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:39,060
Badri veteran than you all aspire to be
better than you are.

2862
01:52:39,061 --> 01:52:41,030
It doesn't mean you believe in Jewish
zombies.

2863
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,080
We're not going to win this one.
I'm not going to win this one.

2864
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:45,531
Well,
of course,

2865
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:47,000
you know,
this one's ridiculous.

2866
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:50,210
This is ridiculous.
She talking about shit written on animal

2867
01:52:50,211 --> 01:52:54,020
skins by people who thought the world
was flat and the sun was 17 miles away

2868
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:55,161
and you're like,
oh yeah,

2869
01:52:55,161 --> 01:52:56,570
that's going to make you a better
person.

2870
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:57,920
It's totally,
yeah.

2871
01:52:57,921 --> 01:53:00,440
They found it in clay pots and Qumran
yeah,

2872
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:01,211
the,
and scroll,

2873
01:53:01,211 --> 01:53:06,211
they had to DNA test to find out which
piece of fucking Yak ass on.

2874
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:08,780
I feel sorry for people who have a sort
of bleak,

2875
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:12,950
empty existence that atheist,
it's just so boring.

2876
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:16,770
Terrible nonsense.
Way to look.

2877
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:20,420
A lack of belief in nonsense is not
bleak.

2878
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:21,860
Do you believe?
Plenty of nonsense.

2879
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,000
Like what?
Name one thing?

2880
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:24,330
Uh,
well,

2881
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:26,320
you're so silly.
You've got a silly view on circumcision.

2882
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:31,730
As soon as we've discovered as baby dick
cutting my God,

2883
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:36,080
free agree or disagree,
very nit picky.

2884
01:53:36,081 --> 01:53:39,650
You're a hell of a fucking drama queen.
It's an Ab Dick Cutting.

2885
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:42,980
You tell me what it is.
Give tell them what is it.

2886
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:45,620
If it's not baby Dick Cutting,
I'm going to give you just look.

2887
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:47,560
You win.
I'm just gonna give it too much and you

2888
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:48,680
want to brought up the baby.

2889
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:50,540
Didn't cutting.
Call it.

2890
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,460
Call it something else.
What is it?

2891
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,410
I think it's good grooming.
If aliens from another planet and so I

2892
01:53:56,411 --> 01:53:58,100
had cut all the baby Dick's,
they'd be like,

2893
01:53:58,101 --> 01:54:00,590
what the fuck are you guys doing?
It's just good.

2894
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,080
It's just good grooming.
Okay.

2895
01:54:04,610 --> 01:54:07,700
Obviously we disagree.
What other ridiculous shit do I believe

2896
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:13,360
that's a kin to Jewish zombies.
You're taught say off at a water.

2897
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:18,590
There's nothing more depressing than
seeing somebody who you admire who's

2898
01:54:18,591 --> 01:54:23,591
obviously smart and clever.
Old Fairy Tales to speak so

2899
01:54:24,351 --> 01:54:29,351
disparagingly about such a complex and
fascinating part of who we are.

2900
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:33,350
You're right.
Totally.

2901
01:54:33,351 --> 01:54:34,700
Even if you,
even if you take the view,

2902
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:35,870
let's say living flowback,
right?

2903
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:38,370
Even if you take the Foi Bucky end view,
you know,

2904
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:41,300
and say,
I don't believe in any of these

2905
01:54:41,301 --> 01:54:42,510
religions say,
okay,

2906
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:45,650
but if we look at what they have in
common and what that says about the

2907
01:54:45,651 --> 01:54:47,570
human spirit,
what we aspire to,

2908
01:54:47,571 --> 01:54:48,800
what we consider most important.

2909
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,150
So for example,
Christianity,

2910
01:54:50,151 --> 01:54:52,700
we might consider self sacrifice and
love the most important things because

2911
01:54:52,701 --> 01:54:53,031
the,
you know,

2912
01:54:53,031 --> 01:54:57,560
self sacrifice and love are the two
central instincts that the red threads

2913
01:54:57,561 --> 01:55:00,200
that run through the Christian Canon,
Monster Christian literature run to

2914
01:55:00,201 --> 01:55:04,250
Christian history.
That was the most important say is this,

2915
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:05,750
okay?
I don't believe in this stuff,

2916
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:10,810
but this is an essential human,
human artifact of human culture and

2917
01:55:11,241 --> 01:55:13,850
history because it teaches us more about
ourselves than anything else,

2918
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,470
right?
It teaches us over centuries,

2919
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:17,930
centuries.
This is evolved to teach us what we find

2920
01:55:17,931 --> 01:55:21,320
most important and different religions
in different places are fascinating

2921
01:55:21,321 --> 01:55:26,240
because they illustrate the different
emphases on those core values of love

2922
01:55:26,241 --> 01:55:29,480
and charity and stuff like that.
Different societies place on things.

2923
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:32,760
Now,
I'm not asking you to believe that,

2924
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:34,640
uh,
that when you take holy communion,

2925
01:55:34,641 --> 01:55:35,910
you are ingesting the,
you know,

2926
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,330
the body and blood of Christ.
That's not going to happen.

2927
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:41,970
But what I am suggesting that you
shouldn't be such a dismissive asshole

2928
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:44,410
about,

2929
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:46,260
you know,
such an integral,

2930
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:48,750
rich,
beautiful and crucial part of human

2931
01:55:48,751 --> 01:55:50,640
history that teaches us so much about
who we are.

2932
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:53,670
Okay?
First of all cases a disingenuous

2933
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:57,730
disingenuine sorry,
you were mocking me about [inaudible]

2934
01:55:57,890 --> 01:56:01,950
absolutely.
Coming back from the dead healing people

2935
01:56:01,951 --> 01:56:04,950
turning wine.
What I'm saying is even if you only

2936
01:56:04,951 --> 01:56:07,260
believe their stories,
these are the most important stories

2937
01:56:07,261 --> 01:56:10,570
that were the western tradition
symbolization stories,

2938
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:12,930
the most important stories that have
ever been told about folklore.

2939
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:17,010
Even if you believe that they say
something deep and profound about who we

2940
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:19,680
are and about what we care about most,
about our anxieties,

2941
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:22,420
about our beliefs and about our,
um,

2942
01:56:22,490 --> 01:56:23,460
you know,
our sympathies,

2943
01:56:23,461 --> 01:56:25,650
the way we relate to one another,
the way that that's adorable.

2944
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:37,020
I'm presenting one reason why you should
be less flippant and dismissive about

2945
01:56:37,021 --> 01:56:40,290
religion because you are too smart to be
that much of a covenant religion.

2946
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:44,730
I can't believe it's small.
You are far too smart.

2947
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:48,960
You are far too intelligent and
individual to treat religion with the

2948
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:51,480
amount of contempt you do.
This is more assholes too.

2949
01:56:51,690 --> 01:56:54,930
This is not what asked mediocre,
mediocre intelligence,

2950
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:56,050
zealots,
APS,

2951
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:58,860
Jews,
feminists of doing distorting the

2952
01:56:58,861 --> 01:57:00,780
argument.
What my reality is,

2953
01:57:00,781 --> 01:57:03,420
we're talking about myths and we're
talking about Penn.

2954
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:07,980
I'm saved those myths so much that they
won't let people get married because it

2955
01:57:07,981 --> 01:57:11,940
goes against their myth.
I'm saying I can disagree with them and

2956
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:13,560
that would happen.
You can disagree with,

2957
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:17,190
you can just pull it right?
Where's the love and the Davis.

2958
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:19,470
You can disagree with everything that
they teach.

2959
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,170
You can say that it's nonsense.
You can agree that you can,

2960
01:57:22,171 --> 01:57:24,540
if you want to agree that it has bad
consequences in society,

2961
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:30,510
you shouldn't do is ridicule and
dismiss,

2962
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:31,510
you know,
sort of the,

2963
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:32,850
you know,
Jewish Zombie Shit,

2964
01:57:32,851 --> 01:57:33,150
right?

2965
01:57:33,150 --> 01:57:36,960
You're just doing it to be outrageous.
You're just doing what you shouldn't do.

2966
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:37,794
And look,
there was a good

2967
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,040
place for it for outrageousness and
provocation.

2968
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:42,420
Right.
And I'm not trying to put you on trial

2969
01:57:42,421 --> 01:57:45,180
here,
but I'm saying is you're too smart to

2970
01:57:45,181 --> 01:57:47,370
fall into this habit and it's a leftist
thing.

2971
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:51,660
This militant atheism crap or you
dismiss the central importance of

2972
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:56,690
religion to our culture is the central
importance through barbaric days with

2973
01:57:57,901 --> 01:58:00,270
rules.
What we worried about the consequences

2974
01:58:00,271 --> 01:58:03,210
of God's punishing.
Most of our laws are based on religious

2975
01:58:03,211 --> 01:58:04,530
prescription.
When you get down to it,

2976
01:58:04,990 --> 01:58:09,840
most of the way society is
organized is based on what's ultimately

2977
01:58:09,841 --> 01:58:13,890
religious prescription.
My point is simply and only that if

2978
01:58:13,891 --> 01:58:18,150
you're going to be a flippant asshole,
at least acknowledge that first of all,

2979
01:58:18,151 --> 01:58:19,260
half the population,
you know,

2980
01:58:19,261 --> 01:58:21,240
it does take this stuff seriously.
And second of all,

2981
01:58:21,241 --> 01:58:23,640
this is important stuff that tells us
about who we are.

2982
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:26,100
And I think it's beneath you to be so
flippant about it.

2983
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:29,580
It's about feminism because feminism is
not as important.

2984
01:58:29,581 --> 01:58:34,581
Stein tells us about flippant and cruel
and vindictive and spiteful and horrible

2985
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:37,080
about crazy feminists because they're
crazy.

2986
01:58:37,081 --> 01:58:40,080
And because what they do is ridiculous.
I don't think whether or not you're an

2987
01:58:40,081 --> 01:58:41,950
atheist,
that religion is ridiculous and I think

2988
01:58:41,951 --> 01:58:42,040
it

2989
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,990
deserves a bit more respectful.
Well that's fine.

2990
01:58:43,991 --> 01:58:45,970
You're allowed to think of,
but just because you think it doesn't

2991
01:58:45,971 --> 01:58:48,970
mean it's right and the idea that it
makes you a flip an asshole because

2992
01:58:48,971 --> 01:58:52,450
you're unwilling to accept myths,
you're unwilling to accept things that

2993
01:58:52,451 --> 01:58:55,750
make no sense whatsoever.
You're unwilling to accept things that

2994
01:58:55,751 --> 01:58:59,380
are
not acknowledging the extent to which

2995
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:01,000
religion has made you who you are.
I mean,

2996
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:05,260
you know from the speech,
the rejection codes that you grow up

2997
01:59:05,261 --> 01:59:09,690
with your moral code spaces doesn't mean
stupid.

2998
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:11,410
I didn't say.
That doesn't mean that

2999
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:17,060
what got us to here,
you will see ball,

3000
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:20,340
your senses,
your sense of right and religion,

3001
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:24,210
which was created by people's sense of
right and wrong bull shit

3002
01:59:26,490 --> 01:59:30,280
and shit.
And it's interesting he's not come from

3003
01:59:30,281 --> 01:59:31,780
that.
That's not very angry.

3004
01:59:31,781 --> 01:59:34,280
It's not true.
Your sense of right and wrong comes from

3005
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,153
Judy.

3006
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:37,390
You got to stop saying that because it's
not true.

3007
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:43,240
This cultural,
there's right and wrong and other

3008
01:59:43,241 --> 01:59:45,850
cultures had to completely different
from what we consider.

3009
01:59:45,851 --> 01:59:48,040
Right and wrong in America.
Look in New Guinea.

3010
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:50,260
Do you know what about the sperm
warriors in New Guinea?

3011
01:59:50,261 --> 01:59:54,250
These men that take these young boys
when they're young and inseminate them,

3012
01:59:54,251 --> 01:59:56,890
put common their mouths and their acids
to make them grow.

3013
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:58,530
They do that from the time they have
like,

3014
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:02,780
isn't that great?
It's their culture.

3015
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,960
It's,
it's what's right and what's wrong for

3016
02:00:04,961 --> 02:00:07,480
them.
Things that would be absolutely illegal

3017
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:10,660
would lock you up in jail for in America
and in Europe,

3018
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:14,530
in New Guinea.
This is a great long tradition of this

3019
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:18,050
part and then out your day a Christians.
It's cultural.

3020
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:18,913
Yes,
exactly.

3021
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:23,380
Christian cultures,
many things that you have good values

3022
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:27,800
that I agree with the call Shit Bullshit
for me,

3023
02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:28,723
I just made it.

3024
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,220
You grew up in a basis.
Christianity.

3025
02:00:30,221 --> 02:00:31,780
You're a good person.
This place where there's no

3026
02:00:31,781 --> 02:00:33,370
Christianity,
they come and boys mouths.

3027
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,940
There's one place that has a fucked up
way of looking at things.

3028
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:40,570
It's a cultural thing.
It doesn't have it everywhere.

3029
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:42,990
That doesn't have a strong Christian.
Heritage is a fucked up place with bad

3030
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:45,850
with bad morals.
That's a ridiculous statement.

3031
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:49,370
That's a ridiculous statement everywhere
that doesn't have jail,

3032
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:53,680
Judeo Christian values,
a fucked up place.

3033
02:00:53,710 --> 02:00:54,910
I think that,
yes,

3034
02:00:54,911 --> 02:00:56,680
I think,
I think you should be perfectly

3035
02:00:56,681 --> 02:00:58,840
reasonable respectful thing to say our
culture is better.

3036
02:00:58,841 --> 02:01:02,730
I believe our culture is better than the
culture of Christian European shares,

3037
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:04,820
Ketamine,
Ph,

3038
02:01:04,830 --> 02:01:08,650
other European and American culture,
which is based on Judeo Christian values

3039
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:11,620
is better than other cultures.
I think it's uncontroversial to say so,

3040
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:15,550
but what's what,
based on Judeo Christian values about

3041
02:01:15,551 --> 02:01:20,230
being a good person,
ultimately all us from the Bible,

3042
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:23,290
what it does,
what comes from the Bible.

3043
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:25,000
Ultimately our sense of right and wrong
comes to the Bible,

3044
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:26,590
our sense of,
right.

3045
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:31,120
I think you also see the only way that a
person could have ethics and morals and

3046
02:01:31,121 --> 02:01:32,140
treat each other.
I wouldn't say the

3047
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:35,860
Pacific.
Listen,

3048
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:38,320
if we're going to have a conversation,
we can't keep talking over each other

3049
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:40,130
like this.
When someone's trying to make

3050
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,200
a point about something that's complex
like this,

3051
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:45,800
if you're,
if you think that the only way for a

3052
02:01:45,801 --> 02:01:48,560
person to have ethics or an
understanding of each other or

3053
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:52,430
compassion for each other is to rely on
ancient myths that are easily,

3054
02:01:52,431 --> 02:01:54,140
scientifically disproven.
Well,

3055
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:55,610
that's what Christianity is.
No,

3056
02:01:55,611 --> 02:01:57,730
I didn't say that.
That's what the Bible said.

3057
02:01:57,740 --> 02:02:01,430
This is the specific set of values that
you have is influenced more than you

3058
02:02:01,431 --> 02:02:04,730
would like to admit by your Judaic
Christian influenced by

3059
02:02:06,340 --> 02:02:07,173
all of us.
Have,

3060
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:07,850
I mean,
look,

3061
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:10,400
I think that some,
some of what we would call morality

3062
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:13,280
obviously comes from natural revulsion,
which is more like biological,

3063
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:13,881
right?
Then this is,

3064
02:02:13,881 --> 02:02:15,980
this is some of the prescriptions
against perhaps against murder,

3065
02:02:15,981 --> 02:02:17,630
perhaps against child abuse,
that kind of stuff.

3066
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:19,190
Right?
It comes from instead of natural

3067
02:02:19,191 --> 02:02:21,770
revulsion and it may be an evolutionary,
biological imperative.

3068
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:23,510
There's certain things that we just know
we shouldn't do.

3069
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,280
Right.
And that's our body's saying no,

3070
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:25,761
like,
you know,

3071
02:02:25,761 --> 02:02:27,250
like the smell of rotten food.
You know,

3072
02:02:27,251 --> 02:02:28,140
it was stuff like that.
Yeah.

3073
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:30,560
Um,
but there are other things that,

3074
02:02:30,561 --> 02:02:32,300
um,
the definitely come from the,

3075
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:36,740
from the Judaic Christian tradition has
defined most of what we consider to be

3076
02:02:36,741 --> 02:02:39,230
right and wrong in the west.
And I think our society is the better

3077
02:02:39,231 --> 02:02:40,220
for it.
Uh,

3078
02:02:40,221 --> 02:02:42,680
and I think that our society is better
than elsewhere in the world.

3079
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:49,230
And your lifestyle is proof positive
that that's the evolution of what this

3080
02:02:49,701 --> 02:02:52,670
used to be or what it is today.
Early speaking,

3081
02:02:52,730 --> 02:02:55,330
I'm an outlier because I mean,
as you know,

3082
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:58,880
gay people generally test hire for Iq
than the rest of the population and lots

3083
02:02:58,881 --> 02:03:02,570
of evolutionary biologists and we'll
suggest that that gate people with high

3084
02:03:02,571 --> 02:03:05,320
Iq is tend to engage in,
um,

3085
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:09,410
uh,
dissident or unusual habits and

3086
02:03:09,411 --> 02:03:11,240
practices in general because that's
where,

3087
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:13,280
um,
where mother nature does her

3088
02:03:13,281 --> 02:03:16,130
experimentations,
where she tests the limits of,

3089
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:17,360
of,
um,

3090
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,080
of the species.

3091
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:21,170
So people with very high Iq are more
likely to be homosexual goes the

3092
02:03:21,171 --> 02:03:25,820
evolutionary biology argument because
it's in those very smart people that the

3093
02:03:25,821 --> 02:03:29,150
sort of the,
the transgression and transgressive

3094
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:31,010
dissidents stuff has tried out by mother
nature.

3095
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:34,880
So I would say I'm probably an outlier.
There is a very small homosexual.

3096
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:38,030
Um,
you know I'm not typical of of sort of

3097
02:03:38,031 --> 02:03:41,300
mainstay of,
of of the kind of bulk of the species.

3098
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:44,120
Right.
But what you are,

3099
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:48,050
I mean I might take it to whoever you
are but who you are being a gay man who

3100
02:03:48,070 --> 02:03:51,700
I am,
what I do that is this right here but it

3101
02:03:51,701 --> 02:03:53,720
in the Bible.
Yes,

3102
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:57,170
but I agree that it would be better if I
didn't behave like this and if I could

3103
02:03:57,390 --> 02:04:00,650
[inaudible] homosexual.
No.

3104
02:04:00,670 --> 02:04:03,550
And I wouldn't have this you need to
read is wonderful essay by Bernice.

3105
02:04:03,550 --> 02:04:06,080
I don't need to read shit.
What the fuck you're saying.

3106
02:04:06,110 --> 02:04:08,690
Okay.
So goes what you're saying is who you

3107
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:13,691
are is prohibited in the bylaw because I
don't think my sexuality is an important

3108
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,400
component part of you.
You talk about it all the time.

3109
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:20,720
It's a massive part of what we've talked
about on this show I think comes up

3110
02:04:20,721 --> 02:04:25,690
anytime you want to make a funny point.
It comes up anytime you want to do malty

3111
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:30,300
or your urges or do well on a few.
I think people,

3112
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:33,260
I think it's you,
what I think people leap to the most,

3113
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:34,850
uh,
the most different thing about

3114
02:04:34,851 --> 02:04:36,800
themselves,
the most unusual thing about themselves.

3115
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,680
Anytime they want to be funny or be,
um,

3116
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:40,740
you know,
it's black versus white.

3117
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:42,120
Black comedians talk about being black a
lot.

3118
02:04:42,121 --> 02:04:43,320
Chris rock always talks about,
you know,

3119
02:04:43,321 --> 02:04:44,690
blacks and inward.
Um,

3120
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:45,990
it's why,
uh,

3121
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,430
you know,
Muslim comedians only ever talk about

3122
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:47,730
Islam.

3123
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:48,061
It's,
you know,

3124
02:04:48,061 --> 02:04:49,740
gay comedians talk about being gay.
I think that's,

3125
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:52,770
you go to that because it's the most
different funny thing about you.

3126
02:04:52,771 --> 02:04:53,461
It's,
and it's a sort of,

3127
02:04:53,461 --> 02:04:55,170
sort of a form of laziness I suppose.
Um,

3128
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:56,790
so I don't know that's particularly
relevant,

3129
02:04:56,791 --> 02:04:57,420
but,
uh,

3130
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:58,380
I'll wait.
Listen,

3131
02:04:58,381 --> 02:05:02,700
it's absolutely relevant.
Make it bounce to the jokes and a lot of

3132
02:05:02,701 --> 02:05:05,370
cultures and Muslim culture is not going
to use no announced.

3133
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:07,250
Um,
and it's,

3134
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:08,820
it's any of them.
It's in the Muslim world that does that.

3135
02:05:08,821 --> 02:05:12,090
Now.
11 countries continue the grand old

3136
02:05:12,091 --> 02:05:15,630
tradition of killing gay people.
But that shit's been around forever.

3137
02:05:15,631 --> 02:05:18,300
I mean,
what does it say in the Bible about a

3138
02:05:18,301 --> 02:05:20,640
man lying with another man?
I think if I could,

3139
02:05:20,690 --> 02:05:22,570
I mean,
if I could change,

3140
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:25,050
if I could choose,
I wouldn't be homosexual.

3141
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:26,640
That doesn't make me self loathing.

3142
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:30,210
So if someone came out and it just made
me so Pfizer came out with a pill to

3143
02:05:30,211 --> 02:05:31,380
make me,
no,

3144
02:05:31,381 --> 02:05:32,011
it doesn't.
No,

3145
02:05:32,011 --> 02:05:36,720
it doesn't make you self loathing to
hate a part of what you are a part of

3146
02:05:36,721 --> 02:05:37,890
what I am.
I love all of me,

3147
02:05:37,891 --> 02:05:40,050
but if I could choose to be even better,
then I would be.

3148
02:05:40,051 --> 02:05:41,940
So you'd be better if you were straight?
Yes.

3149
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:43,320
Wow.
Anybody would be,

3150
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:48,390
if Johnson would be better if he was
strong and had an anti gay pill.

3151
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:49,590
Yeah,
you would take it.

3152
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:51,480
What?
It would be curious suicide,

3153
02:05:51,481 --> 02:05:52,314
but I probably would.
Yeah.

3154
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:54,150
Would it be career suicide?
You don't think that you could

3155
02:05:54,151 --> 02:05:57,420
transition into the straight world?
You would be the poster boy for

3156
02:05:57,421 --> 02:05:58,254
Christian.
Right?

3157
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,510
They would love you.
Tru,

3158
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:01,050
you know,
if I were to pray the gay away,

3159
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:02,370
I'd be so popular.

3160
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:05,430
Super popular.
That's what's holding you back is the

3161
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:06,600
gay.
You're right.

3162
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:07,980
Maybe that's,
you're intelligent.

3163
02:06:07,981 --> 02:06:09,720
You're good looking.
You're well dressed.

3164
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,100
It's true.
It's true.

3165
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:12,990
You're right.
Okay.

3166
02:06:12,991 --> 02:06:14,340
I'm going to,
I'm going to enroll in one of these

3167
02:06:14,341 --> 02:06:15,360
camps again.
I'm going to cheat.

3168
02:06:15,361 --> 02:06:17,790
I'm going to get out the work.
They just an excuse for Denise,

3169
02:06:19,030 --> 02:06:22,350
like Michele Bachmann's husband.
You ever heard about the camp that that

3170
02:06:22,351 --> 02:06:26,440
guy was running?
That guy's the greatest or Oregon after

3171
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:28,320
hours.
How about you say that,

3172
02:06:28,321 --> 02:06:29,580
but hold up.
We'll bring that back.

3173
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:33,570
But how about the guy that got arrested?
Hillary fucking people at that,

3174
02:06:33,571 --> 02:06:36,510
uh,
that community center killer.

3175
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:39,870
Then often many cases,
serial killers.

3176
02:06:39,871 --> 02:06:40,381
I was like,
no,

3177
02:06:40,381 --> 02:06:43,770
he's a KKK guy that got arrested with
black prostitutes.

3178
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:45,780
Oh yeah,
of course he did.

3179
02:06:45,781 --> 02:06:46,591
Of course he did.
Of course.

3180
02:06:46,591 --> 02:06:48,180
He's my favorite course.
I love it.

3181
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:50,390
They're out of the grace of God.
Go on.

3182
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,410
Um,
so my favorite guys,

3183
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:55,440
people who get caught with black
prostitutes,

3184
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:57,260
I mean literally could,
could be me on any first aid,

3185
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:59,900
the racist murderers to get caught with
blackboard.

3186
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:03,450
Those are adorable.
I didn't mean at first,

3187
02:07:03,451 --> 02:07:06,210
but as long as you don't have to have
direct contact with anybody,

3188
02:07:06,211 --> 02:07:07,830
they affected.
It's an adorable story.

3189
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:09,300
No,
obviously I don't,

3190
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:12,500
there was a guy look at him.
Ah,

3191
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:18,450
and you just know that he had like these
big black girls whipping him and like

3192
02:07:18,451 --> 02:07:19,310
raping him with,
um,

3193
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:20,610
you know,
with a Dildo and stuff.

3194
02:07:20,611 --> 02:07:23,550
You just know that when he was a male
sub men,

3195
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:27,940
male prostitutes see black male
prostitutes Mandingo thing,

3196
02:07:27,941 --> 02:07:29,970
didn't he?
There's a lot going on there.

3197
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:32,730
It,
I just can't believe that you would,

3198
02:07:32,731 --> 02:07:35,920
uh,
you would decide to not be gay if you

3199
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:36,250
could.

3200
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,340
And is that because of Christian values?
No,

3201
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:38,890
no,
no.

3202
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:40,690
So what is it?
Uh,

3203
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:45,070
I,
I don't think it's self loathing to

3204
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:48,340
acknowledge that being homosexual is
obviously a sort of aberrant sexuality.

3205
02:07:48,341 --> 02:07:50,590
It's something that Mother Nature does
on the fringes and nobody really knows

3206
02:07:50,591 --> 02:07:51,550
why.
And it could be,

3207
02:07:51,551 --> 02:07:53,710
you know,
elegant variation and the evolutionary

3208
02:07:53,711 --> 02:07:55,810
process.
It could be all sorts of things.

3209
02:07:56,050 --> 02:07:57,750
Who knows the variation,
the,

3210
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,980
something like that.
Uh,

3211
02:07:59,981 --> 02:08:02,260
from a Christian perspective,
it could be a test from the evolutionary

3212
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:05,900
perspective.
It could be a Christian perspective.

3213
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:10,540
Some Christians believe that you get
these things in life as tests and they

3214
02:08:10,541 --> 02:08:12,820
don't judge the sinner.
They judge the sin and what they mean by

3215
02:08:12,821 --> 02:08:15,430
that is you can be gay,
but if you act on it,

3216
02:08:15,431 --> 02:08:17,410
that's when you become sin so they don't
stay.

3217
02:08:17,411 --> 02:08:18,670
Don't blame you for who you are.

3218
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:22,300
They believe me,
they wonder what you'll do is bullshit.

3219
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:24,040
You're gay is fun.
Presenting the argument,

3220
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,870
dude,
fuck,

3221
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:29,920
okay.
There's not a God damn choice in the

3222
02:08:29,921 --> 02:08:34,080
world for you other than being gay.
Well you're the perfect example of this

3223
02:08:34,081 --> 02:08:36,700
shit,
this shipping nonsense that it's a

3224
02:08:36,701 --> 02:08:40,150
choice that somehow or another you're
presented [inaudible]

3225
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:44,440
you're on.
You're on that because I'm actually born

3226
02:08:44,441 --> 02:08:45,880
this way is an invention of the gay
lobby.

3227
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:49,960
Once you go back to the
science for this,

3228
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:54,940
as you guys know base,
there is a broad spectrum.

3229
02:08:54,980 --> 02:08:56,650
There is nice.
Actually what I'm going to be very

3230
02:08:56,651 --> 02:08:58,780
specific because I know you like
specificity.

3231
02:08:59,890 --> 02:09:03,220
There is no basis in science for the
born this way argument.

3232
02:09:03,221 --> 02:09:05,890
There's no basis in science that you are
simply born gay and that's all there is

3233
02:09:05,891 --> 02:09:08,740
to it.
What the science suggests is that it is

3234
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:11,230
very much nature and nurture and it can,
it's as much as 50,

3235
02:09:11,231 --> 02:09:12,910
50 in nature and nurture.

3236
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:15,940
Right?
The gay lobby in the 1980s was worried

3237
02:09:15,941 --> 02:09:17,150
about,
as I finish this one,

3238
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:21,040
the gay lobby in the 1980s was worried
because religious people were saying

3239
02:09:21,050 --> 02:09:24,040
that the gay lifestyle lifestyle,
it was a sinful choice,

3240
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:26,110
right?
So they came up with this thing in the

3241
02:09:26,111 --> 02:09:30,460
gay gene and it is an invention of the
gay lobby designed to get around

3242
02:09:30,490 --> 02:09:32,650
religious bigots.
It's designed to,

3243
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:36,070
um,
to wrong foot to the religious right and

3244
02:09:36,071 --> 02:09:39,880
suggest that people's sexuality has no,
there's no element of choice and people

3245
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:43,090
sexuality born this way.
You're hearing lady Gaga Song and we

3246
02:09:43,091 --> 02:09:46,030
take it as good as,
as granted as you obviously had no idea

3247
02:09:46,031 --> 02:09:49,600
that it was even real until you just
said the lady Gaga was born this way.

3248
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:51,430
Uh,
one of her biggest hits,

3249
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:53,500
never heard of it.
Indeed.

3250
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:55,660
Uh,
one of her biggest hits is based on an

3251
02:09:55,661 --> 02:09:56,020
invention.

3252
02:09:56,020 --> 02:10:00,280
The gala with no basis in science.
What the science says is it's a mixture.

3253
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:03,310
So it simply isn't true to say that you
know,

3254
02:10:03,311 --> 02:10:05,140
you're just born gay and that's all
there is to it.

3255
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:09,940
For most people it is a mixture of early
environmental factors and natural

3256
02:10:09,941 --> 02:10:12,460
predisposition.
That's the most we can say that's the

3257
02:10:12,461 --> 02:10:14,290
most,
that's with any confidence and with any

3258
02:10:14,291 --> 02:10:16,060
surety,
that's the most that we can say from the

3259
02:10:16,061 --> 02:10:19,030
available science born this way is a
marketing gimmick.

3260
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:21,100
It doesn't mean anything.
Okay.

3261
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:23,950
But when you say that you're,
you're talking about,

3262
02:10:23,951 --> 02:10:26,470
again,
a broad spectrum of human sexuality.

3263
02:10:26,471 --> 02:10:30,250
So some people come part going to be
much more nurturing.

3264
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:33,800
Some people it's going to be much more
nature are born gay.

3265
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:35,930
There's a fucking kid that lives down my
street,

3266
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,850
he's five years old and he's gay gaze.
Fuck,

3267
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:39,950
okay,
you might like to play with Asian man,

3268
02:10:39,951 --> 02:10:41,990
but he doesn't necessarily,
he's not necessarily gonna be gay.

3269
02:10:41,991 --> 02:10:46,220
And I have a problem with you ascribing
sexuality to a five year old boy because

3270
02:10:46,221 --> 02:10:48,200
that's exactly what the transgender
parents do.

3271
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:49,970
That's exactly when the transgender
parents say,

3272
02:10:49,971 --> 02:10:52,100
my five year old was really supposed to
be a girl.

3273
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:55,010
You're doing exactly the same thing
you're saying he's five years old.

3274
02:10:55,011 --> 02:10:58,040
He hasn't even hit puberty yet.
He has no idea who he is.

3275
02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:01,310
No idea what he's going to believe.
No idea who is going to want to fuck

3276
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:03,350
when he's older.
He's nowhere near puberty and your

3277
02:11:03,351 --> 02:11:06,020
saying this kid is gay.
You are doing exactly the same thing as

3278
02:11:06,021 --> 02:11:08,990
these Canadian parents who say that my
five year old girl should be a boy.

3279
02:11:09,110 --> 02:11:11,060
Please give them hormones.
You'd be exactly the same.

3280
02:11:11,061 --> 02:11:12,620
Certainly not.
I'm certainly not because I don't want

3281
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:15,260
to give anybody hormones and I don't
want to influence this guy's life in any

3282
02:11:15,261 --> 02:11:19,640
way so I'm going to hang back and watch
fucking apologize.

3283
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:22,080
I will come back to you in 10 years.
I will come back on this show.

3284
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:27,370
You get him on cause his mom calls him
go well his mum is wrong and his mom,

3285
02:11:27,371 --> 02:11:30,200
his mom is just random everyday
Schweppes his ass.

3286
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:34,520
She might know he's gay.
She knows all the things say is up

3287
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:36,200
there.
She's not a bad person.

3288
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:38,360
She's not a bad person.
She's finding things he's put up.

3289
02:11:38,361 --> 02:11:42,380
There are all black dicks.
She doesn't say it in a in a bad way.

3290
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:44,900
She just said she's just pretty sure
he's gay.

3291
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:46,700
You know what actually think he's seven
now.

3292
02:11:46,701 --> 02:11:48,980
I don't particularly like that line of
argument.

3293
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:50,930
Ascribing sexualities.
People that haven't even hit puberty

3294
02:11:50,931 --> 02:11:51,860
yet,
it seems a bit much to me.

3295
02:11:52,050 --> 02:11:55,910
You'd think that with a lot of people
they are gay.

3296
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:59,600
I mean Jen is just what they are
with you.

3297
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:00,980
Some people.
No,

3298
02:12:00,990 --> 02:12:02,750
no.
I'm definitely for you made a choice.

3299
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:05,960
Definitely 50 50 50 50 so you're well
aware of the fact that there is an

3300
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:10,190
element of deliberation in my sexuality
and that's one of the things that annoys

3301
02:12:10,191 --> 02:12:14,810
me about the establishment gay left
where they insist born this way is on

3302
02:12:14,811 --> 02:12:18,460
placards and banners and the Texas,
the taxpayers,

3303
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,870
the taxpayers,
some but a minority,

3304
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,960
a minority of people have no choice over
their sexuality.

3305
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:25,970
Out of the,
out of the total number of gay people in

3306
02:12:25,971 --> 02:12:27,680
minority have no have no choice
whatsoever.

3307
02:12:28,060 --> 02:12:30,170
Nobody else.
There is a varying amount of choice.

3308
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:33,950
I am aware that there was a degree of
deliberation and my sexual orientation,

3309
02:12:33,951 --> 02:12:37,880
yet I am forced through my taxes to pay
for gay pride banners that say born this

3310
02:12:37,881 --> 02:12:38,270
way.

3311
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:40,490
It's just something that you are,
yeah,

3312
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:42,500
I mean like the way that gay pride stuff
is,

3313
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:45,040
is financed by the taxpayer in England.
Right.

3314
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:46,280
It's given,
given money by the government.

3315
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:50,030
My taxes go to gay pride.
People who tell lies in the street stuff

3316
02:12:50,031 --> 02:12:53,540
that I know isn't true.
Medu it basically to get people and they

3317
02:12:53,541 --> 02:12:56,870
do it in the same bitter,
nasty way that paid for a sign that just

3318
02:12:56,871 --> 02:12:58,540
said it's okay to be gay.
Would you be cool though?

3319
02:12:58,550 --> 02:13:00,260
They do that too and I'm fine with that.
Yeah,

3320
02:13:00,261 --> 02:13:01,280
sure.
I don't want my taxes,

3321
02:13:02,640 --> 02:13:04,100
my taxes to pay for it.
Uh,

3322
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:07,460
I definitely said born this way and then
the asterick some small percentage.

3323
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:12,760
Well that would be your kind of,
that will be your dreary pick a side,

3324
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:17,690
some people that gay comma and then
you'd have like a paragraph of text.

3325
02:13:17,690 --> 02:13:19,010
You know,
you wouldn't actually be able to see it

3326
02:13:19,011 --> 02:13:20,400
from very far away,
but your,

3327
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:23,000
your version of this gift,
this born this way sign.

3328
02:13:23,001 --> 02:13:25,190
We'd be like,
let me start with this online in some

3329
02:13:25,191 --> 02:13:26,710
circumstances be bought.
Do you see this?

3330
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:28,900
You see the problem now you to see the
problem now,

3331
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:30,890
but I'm objecting.
I'm just

3332
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:37,500
is simply telling people lies born this
way is a lie and true story with some of

3333
02:13:39,301 --> 02:13:41,880
them.
Nobody that's holding the signs because

3334
02:13:41,881 --> 02:13:44,700
most of the ones holding the signs,
the militant homosexuals are the ones

3335
02:13:44,701 --> 02:13:47,270
that chose to be gay to get it.
People gays.

3336
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:49,480
Does she uh,
do,

3337
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:52,020
do you have like debates with gay people
about their sources?

3338
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:54,060
My skates wanting to debate me because
they know they'll lose.

3339
02:13:55,030 --> 02:13:56,440
Well they've got woman brains.
Don't worry.

3340
02:13:56,441 --> 02:14:00,420
Get logic brains.
I'm just kidding.

3341
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:02,060
You accuse me trolling out here.

3342
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:04,410
So I thought I better do it to live up
to the reputation.

3343
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:07,230
Certainly do.
And you're also very aware that uh,

3344
02:14:07,330 --> 02:14:09,610
you,
you are right wing views and the,

3345
02:14:09,611 --> 02:14:10,444
there was right,
right.

3346
02:14:11,130 --> 02:14:13,140
Kind of a little bit of a right wing Ben
to you.

3347
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:17,400
You talk about conservatives and dressy
events to wear a suit and tie this,

3348
02:14:17,401 --> 02:14:22,230
this right?
Like a good way to align yourself in the

3349
02:14:22,231 --> 02:14:27,231
club is you have to espouse Christian
values or talking about being Christian.

3350
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:31,170
Give us stuff about what the
conservative establishment thinks of me.

3351
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:33,120
If I did,
my career would have turned out very

3352
02:14:33,150 --> 02:14:34,140
differently.
I've,

3353
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:34,930
I,
you know,

3354
02:14:34,930 --> 02:14:38,700
I would have chosen a very different
path through my professional life.

3355
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:39,860
You know,
I was at the Telegraph and it,

3356
02:14:39,861 --> 02:14:40,090
you know,
the,

3357
02:14:40,090 --> 02:14:44,160
the most respectable establishment
newspaper in England,

3358
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:46,740
uh,
eight years ago if I'd want it to be,

3359
02:14:46,741 --> 02:14:47,850
you know,
a sign on of the,

3360
02:14:47,851 --> 02:14:50,160
of the conservative Republican
establishment.

3361
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:52,050
I could've done that.
I did the exact opposite.

3362
02:14:52,051 --> 02:14:56,190
I've stuck my nose up and my middle
finger up at conservatives every

3363
02:14:56,191 --> 02:14:57,780
available opportunity.
I bright,

3364
02:14:57,781 --> 02:15:00,570
poor,
poor Breitbart who put up with so much

3365
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:01,470
from me.
You know,

3366
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:04,920
they published Black Dick Jokes every
week from me and that is a direct

3367
02:15:04,921 --> 02:15:08,040
assault on the kind of stomach churn
that the conservative writers or West

3368
02:15:08,041 --> 02:15:09,390
set to have about gay things.
Right?

3369
02:15:09,391 --> 02:15:12,030
I don't just tell them I'm gay.
I tell them I'm sucking Black Dick,

3370
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:15,870
right?
Really good columns to be funny and

3371
02:15:15,871 --> 02:15:17,160
entertaining and I'm right to
everything.

3372
02:15:17,161 --> 02:15:21,570
And it also puts them in a very
interesting place where they can say,

3373
02:15:21,571 --> 02:15:23,070
look,
we have a gay guy working for us.

3374
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:26,190
I tend to think probably about gives us
stuff about whether people think that

3375
02:15:26,191 --> 02:15:27,620
homophobic on all.
They certainly wouldn't hire me.

3376
02:15:27,650 --> 02:15:31,650
The second is everybody.
Everybody does trust me,

3377
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:32,513
trust me.

3378
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,870
Right.
But doesn't care about,

3379
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:36,900
doesn't care if they're not,
but they don't care if you do.

3380
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:39,510
Right.
What they care about is the facts of

3381
02:15:39,511 --> 02:15:40,920
what they published and the facts,
what they probably should,

3382
02:15:41,230 --> 02:15:46,230
but most of the time I see so strange is
someone who believes but doesn't

3383
02:15:47,641 --> 02:15:50,010
practice.
You believe in religion,

3384
02:15:50,011 --> 02:15:52,800
but you don't practice any of the things
that that religious spouses,

3385
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:56,940
especially the sexual of the things,
but what do you practice that religion?

3386
02:15:57,090 --> 02:15:59,420
I do most of the 10 Commandments.
It's steel.

3387
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:01,230
I don't go,
we don't cover the wives.

3388
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:03,360
No.
I mean I probably covered your wife's

3389
02:16:03,370 --> 02:16:04,203
toxin,
but

3390
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:09,110
you see what I'm saying?
Most of

3391
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:14,280
the 10 Commandments.
I saw that on most of the 10

3392
02:16:14,281 --> 02:16:16,590
Commandments.
I except for the gay stuff

3393
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:20,580
that's in the book though.
God is gonna go.

3394
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:21,630
It's gonna look after me.
You know,

3395
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:23,250
I've got a,
I've got a first class ticket to heaven.

3396
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:25,160
Well,
you know the Moses Come Commandments,

3397
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:27,540
the angels,
Jerusalem scholars now believe that

3398
02:16:27,541 --> 02:16:29,290
Moses was high on drugs.
You know that,

3399
02:16:29,291 --> 02:16:30,130
right?
I'm sure you've read

3400
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,570
that.
I guess another thing we have in common

3401
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:33,900
that Moses,
and you don't have any,

3402
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:36,070
but yeah,
I think it was on different drugs,

3403
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:39,770
pills or something.
Back then it was acacia.

3404
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:43,020
I just be strictly accurate.
I have not admitted to anything but the

3405
02:16:43,021 --> 02:16:45,100
bird,
the idea is the idea that the burning

3406
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:49,720
Bush was a Bush that was a high and
concentrated dod like a k.

3407
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:50,410
Yeah,
yeah,

3408
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:51,390
yeah,
yeah.

3409
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:53,200
Yeah.
And that's nice on some kind of awesome

3410
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:55,960
pause.
Very powerful psychedelic.

3411
02:16:55,961 --> 02:16:57,430
Well,
this is Steve Job says he has these

3412
02:16:57,431 --> 02:17:01,600
visions of divine inspiration on Lsd,
which has enabled him to these very

3413
02:17:01,601 --> 02:17:03,200
different than dimethyltryptamine.
No,

3414
02:17:03,230 --> 02:17:07,990
dimethyltryptamine is a visionary
hallucinogen extremely powerful one.

3415
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:11,230
That's the what?
IOWASCA that's the active ingredient and

3416
02:17:11,250 --> 02:17:13,450
Iowasca yeah.
Idea is that,

3417
02:17:13,451 --> 02:17:15,220
that's what Moses was doing.
That,

3418
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:18,700
that's why the burning Bush,
the literal translation of what that

3419
02:17:18,710 --> 02:17:20,830
episode it was your smoking DMT.

3420
02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:26,670
He's getting a DMT trip and that's why
God is giving him these ideas about how

3421
02:17:27,011 --> 02:17:29,110
people should behave and be,
you know,

3422
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:30,430
what,
what is divine,

3423
02:17:30,431 --> 02:17:33,430
you know,
to be kind to each other to have a view

3424
02:17:33,431 --> 02:17:34,510
on that.
But um,

3425
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,580
I suppose it does sound like the
product.

3426
02:17:36,581 --> 02:17:38,910
If somebody on a nice trip,
well these are mainstream scholars.

3427
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,550
They really nice to everyone.
Moon.

3428
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:41,560
Just like,
don't fuck you.

3429
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:44,410
Don't fuck someone else's.
Whoa dude steel.

3430
02:17:44,470 --> 02:17:45,760
I carved it out.
I mean,

3431
02:17:45,761 --> 02:17:47,170
you'd have to be quite high on drugs to
build,

3432
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:50,190
but back then they carved down any idea
that they had.

3433
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:52,960
They didn't really have any other
options.

3434
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:56,530
I couldn't make billboards.
The state have to pay for it.

3435
02:17:57,610 --> 02:18:02,610
The Christianity result of a drug trip.
I haven't had something today that is a,

3436
02:18:02,951 --> 02:18:05,850
what some mainstream scholars believe
this day.

3437
02:18:06,410 --> 02:18:07,480
I have.
I have,

3438
02:18:07,481 --> 02:18:09,820
I think,
I think I'm right in saying that.

3439
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:12,580
I sort of semi read that somewhere and I
didn't follow it up,

3440
02:18:12,581 --> 02:18:13,500
but I will,
I will look into that.

3441
02:18:13,501 --> 02:18:14,560
I'm sure you have.
Well,

3442
02:18:14,561 --> 02:18:17,080
you know John Marco Allegro,
the guy who was one of the,

3443
02:18:17,081 --> 02:18:19,900
uh,
head scholars that was deciphered the

3444
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:21,520
Dead Sea Scrolls after 14 years of
studying.

3445
02:18:21,521 --> 02:18:24,610
He was a ordained minister,
but he was also agnostic because he

3446
02:18:24,611 --> 02:18:26,860
starts studying religion,
realized it was all bullshit,

3447
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:32,130
but he wrote a book called the,
the sacred mushroom and the cross that

3448
02:18:32,441 --> 02:18:36,880
he believes that the entire origins of
Christianity was based around fertility

3449
02:18:36,881 --> 02:18:40,140
rituals and the consumption of
psychedelic mushrooms fast.

3450
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:42,040
That does sound fascinating.
Book,

3451
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,410
obviously Bolex but it does sound fun at
all.

3452
02:18:44,411 --> 02:18:45,130
I mean,
he's,

3453
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:47,830
he was a well renowned religious
scholar.

3454
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:48,783
It does.
It does.

3455
02:18:49,540 --> 02:18:53,050
A guy who understood language,
he actually trace back the word Christ

3456
02:18:53,260 --> 02:18:57,400
to an ancient Sumerian word that meant a
mushroom covered in God's seaman.

3457
02:18:57,810 --> 02:19:01,030
She mean the psychedelic mushrooms that
grew out of nowhere.

3458
02:19:01,060 --> 02:19:04,990
They thought that when it rained,
it was God coming on the earth and that

3459
02:19:04,991 --> 02:19:07,630
these mushrooms that would come up and
then they would eat them and have these

3460
02:19:07,631 --> 02:19:10,210
great trips,
they thought they were experiencing God.

3461
02:19:10,211 --> 02:19:11,590
And you can,
you can,

3462
02:19:11,591 --> 02:19:13,840
um,
you can generate quite a few

3463
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:15,290
extraordinary,
um,

3464
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:19,090
theories with etymology because 70 words
sound like so many other words.

3465
02:19:19,091 --> 02:19:22,330
So it sounds like an interesting thought
experiment and Nice Social Studies

3466
02:19:22,331 --> 02:19:24,400
paper,
but I'm not sure I quite buy it as a

3467
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:25,600
explaining.
Never looked into it.

3468
02:19:25,810 --> 02:19:28,790
But if you do look into it,
you gotta you gotta assume that we'll

3469
02:19:28,791 --> 02:19:29,624
look into,
I'll write about it.

3470
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:32,810
Fascinating.
Spectacular psychedelic experiences

3471
02:19:32,811 --> 02:19:35,240
would be interpreted by the people who
had no science,

3472
02:19:35,241 --> 02:19:36,074
no books,
no,

3473
02:19:36,290 --> 02:19:40,610
no knowledge of what's going on with the
human neuro chemistry as being something

3474
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:42,230
that was divine you.

3475
02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:45,720
If you had no other reference point
sending right about that.

3476
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:46,730
Yeah,
I mean,

3477
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:49,400
I wouldn't say there's lots of things.
There's always things about life in

3478
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:51,230
general that would be considered
miraculous.

3479
02:19:51,231 --> 02:19:53,930
I mean the Sun rising childbirth,
I'm sure there's lots of things that we

3480
02:19:53,931 --> 02:19:55,850
can,
all those things attributed to the gods.

3481
02:19:56,090 --> 02:20:00,350
And when these people were on these
incredibly powerful psychedelic drugs,

3482
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:03,290
they would try to hide this knowledge
from the Romans.

3483
02:20:03,470 --> 02:20:06,140
And so they hid these stories and
parables.

3484
02:20:06,350 --> 02:20:08,630
It's a really fascinating,
and by the way,

3485
02:20:08,631 --> 02:20:11,740
very controversial thing because
religious scholars you,

3486
02:20:11,741 --> 02:20:12,760
you don't say,
well it's,

3487
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:16,520
this is why one of the reasons why is he
was the only one who was an agnostic who

3488
02:20:16,521 --> 02:20:18,440
was on the Dead Sea Scrolls to ciphering
committee,

3489
02:20:18,830 --> 02:20:21,620
all the other ones where it was really,
he was an ordained minister,

3490
02:20:21,860 --> 02:20:25,580
but he wasn't practicing.
All the rest of them were very

3491
02:20:25,581 --> 02:20:26,330
religious.

3492
02:20:26,330 --> 02:20:29,960
And so the interpretations that they
were willing to accept where not what he

3493
02:20:29,961 --> 02:20:33,650
was willing to accept.
So you would have to get someone of that

3494
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:36,260
level of understanding of the language
to,

3495
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:38,570
to debate him on this and what,
I know he's dead,

3496
02:20:38,990 --> 02:20:41,000
but it's Catholic church,
but out the book you can buy it now,

3497
02:20:41,001 --> 02:20:44,570
but it's like a,
well now it got republished a few years

3498
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:47,870
ago by this guy named John Irvin and you
so you can get ahold of it now,

3499
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:50,270
but for the longest time we still have
to buy it as a used book.

3500
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:51,813
Well,
I will look it up.

3501
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:53,840
Yeah.
This one also the Dead Sea Scrolls,

3502
02:20:53,841 --> 02:20:56,450
the Christian myth,
he wrote a second one after the Catholic

3503
02:20:56,450 --> 02:20:58,600
Church bought out.
The first one stopped production of it

3504
02:20:58,601 --> 02:21:00,830
and bought out all the books.
Yes,

3505
02:21:00,831 --> 02:21:02,480
your people.
Catholics.

3506
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:05,190
I tried to hide that information.
We're great at pl.

3507
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:06,380
They last thing they want.

3508
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:09,110
I went to Catholic school,
man for a whole year.

3509
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:10,880
Cured me,
wakes me up.

3510
02:21:10,881 --> 02:21:13,130
Good.
It's where you get you a fine sense of

3511
02:21:13,131 --> 02:21:14,570
right and wrong from no wait,
let's not do that.

3512
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:17,450
Well what's right and wrong as far as
what anyone's right,

3513
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:21,830
what is wrong now I got lucky.
They beat me a little smack me a little

3514
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:23,790
bit.
Lucky you didn't get that taste of no,

3515
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:25,700
I said just like I said earlier,
if it went from Father Michael,

3516
02:21:25,701 --> 02:21:27,830
I would have given far less good head.
I mean,

3517
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:31,280
there was a real father Michael,
so much less than he's going to get

3518
02:21:31,281 --> 02:21:32,750
killed now,
but who was father Michael?

3519
02:21:33,630 --> 02:21:35,930
There's a real dude I should've made me
suck his dick for real.

3520
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,070
Um,
I make me,

3521
02:21:37,071 --> 02:21:38,780
I was going to ask you about it.
I thought my English teacher too,

3522
02:21:38,781 --> 02:21:39,980
but how old was he at the time?

3523
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:41,230
Um,
I don't know.

3524
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:42,123
She's quite young.
Quite cohort.

3525
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:43,363
Really?
Yeah.

3526
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:46,310
And so that's where it all started.
The Father Michael?

3527
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:47,001
No,
no,

3528
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:49,130
it was that post the tranny.
Yeah,

3529
02:21:49,131 --> 02:21:51,350
it was posted.
So it wasn't like I wasn't drag queens a

3530
02:21:51,351 --> 02:21:53,240
child or anything like that.
So,

3531
02:21:53,241 --> 02:21:54,290
uh,
it was quite a,

3532
02:21:54,530 --> 02:21:56,750
you already had the five.
So when like this is all wrong,

3533
02:21:56,751 --> 02:21:58,190
I need to talk to father Michael.
He's like,

3534
02:21:58,191 --> 02:22:00,830
suck my Dick and shut the fuck up.
And you're like,

3535
02:22:00,831 --> 02:22:02,660
religion is,
I really,

3536
02:22:02,661 --> 02:22:04,070
I really had no hope.
Did I?

3537
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:04,940
I was,
I was,

3538
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:07,870
I was never going to end well.
Well it seems like you kept stumbling in

3539
02:22:07,890 --> 02:22:12,890
a Dick's pulling on them through life.
I don't know what would have happened if

3540
02:22:12,981 --> 02:22:16,440
a heterosexual man that he is,
I've just been falling on decks.

3541
02:22:16,460 --> 02:22:18,770
Was in the same circumstances as you
early on.

3542
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:20,930
I mean obviously things would have went
very different,

3543
02:22:20,931 --> 02:22:24,410
so I'm not sure if I buy the not,
you'd go down great.

3544
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:26,250
And the gay club go down.

3545
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:27,031
Well,
I mean,

3546
02:22:27,031 --> 02:22:31,500
you know,
we have an expression you go down well,

3547
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:36,480
so go down what it means you would,
you'd be popular.

3548
02:22:36,490 --> 02:22:38,460
You got your attention.
Would be like the way you would describe

3549
02:22:38,461 --> 02:22:40,290
a meal or a drink.
Oh,

3550
02:22:40,291 --> 02:22:41,280
like it goes down.
Well,

3551
02:22:41,310 --> 02:22:42,143
yeah.
So No.

3552
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:43,740
Um,
we like taking the piss.

3553
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:45,390
Yeah.
Took me a while to get,

3554
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:46,980
what the hell do you want?
A Cup of mine?

3555
02:22:46,981 --> 02:22:48,950
Yeah.
Which,

3556
02:22:48,951 --> 02:22:51,330
which again is another thing.
Gay people seem disproportionately into

3557
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:55,250
their appeal on each other.
That seems to be a water sports.

3558
02:22:55,251 --> 02:22:59,980
So what does the Lord,
I'm saying only gay to be transgressive.

3559
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,900
They choose to be
changed to be gay,

3560
02:23:03,901 --> 02:23:07,440
to be naughty now being a homosexual
place.

3561
02:23:07,441 --> 02:23:10,770
I know Gail.
I just can't full Blair myself away.

3562
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:16,290
Can't tear myself away.
As you get older and you know,

3563
02:23:16,291 --> 02:23:18,270
she'd drive dries up.

3564
02:23:18,580 --> 02:23:20,610
I think I would have made a good priest.
Do you think I'm making a good priest?

3565
02:23:20,611 --> 02:23:21,361
I think a bit.
Well,

3566
02:23:21,361 --> 02:23:23,640
you make a good priests.
If you think the guy that made you suck

3567
02:23:23,641 --> 02:23:25,080
his dick was a good priest.
That kind of,

3568
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:26,790
he was a great priest.
Honesty,

3569
02:23:26,791 --> 02:23:29,040
like he was good.
Other than that,

3570
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:33,320
I've never had a better senior tutor.
He was great singing teacher got notes

3571
02:23:33,321 --> 02:23:36,170
out of me.
I didn't even know I could produce while

3572
02:23:36,210 --> 02:23:38,100
he worked.
Your plumbing shattering,

3573
02:23:38,101 --> 02:23:42,480
the chandelier's kind of,
but was he good outside of what he did?

3574
02:23:42,481 --> 02:23:46,440
Like was he a good religious scholar?
Was he a good parish priest?

3575
02:23:46,441 --> 02:23:48,210
I mean,
I just see she can creep getting his

3576
02:23:48,211 --> 02:23:50,340
Dick sock then it's going to get lynched
now.

3577
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:52,020
How's it going to get lynched?
Does people,

3578
02:23:52,021 --> 02:23:53,730
do people know who he is?
I didn't think so.

3579
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:55,140
What's his name?
Well,

3580
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:56,370
I'm not saying anymore.
I will be you.

3581
02:23:56,371 --> 02:23:58,600
At the time you were a little kid and he
was like,

3582
02:23:58,601 --> 02:23:59,434
what?
You're just trying.

3583
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:01,290
You're trying to,
was he in his twenties or thirties?

3584
02:24:01,910 --> 02:24:04,140
Yes.
Another feminist strategy that you have

3585
02:24:04,141 --> 02:24:06,660
adopted in addition to your language,
but he says he's trying to turn header

3586
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:07,523
files.

3587
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:13,260
I told you it wasn't the pedophilia.
I was teens.

3588
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:15,970
I was in my teens,
14 I was in my teens,

3589
02:24:15,971 --> 02:24:17,380
something like that.
Something like that.

3590
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:19,510
Pedophilia,
buddy.

3591
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:22,350
I don't know how the rocket,
and I was very old England.

3592
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:25,100
I was in my teens.
I'm hearing a my country and never,

3593
02:24:25,710 --> 02:24:28,500
never seen a 15 year old girl at any
point in your life,

3594
02:24:28,501 --> 02:24:30,350
however old you are,
you've never seen a 15 year ago we

3595
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:35,360
thought was off when I was 15 no,
dude,

3596
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:40,230
when you were 25 when you were 13 girls,
about 15 you thought,

3597
02:24:40,231 --> 02:24:41,064
whoa,
whoa.

3598
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:44,000
No,
you did a dental books should be

3599
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:45,990
hopping.
I didn't want to fucker bullshit.

3600
02:24:46,490 --> 02:24:50,220
Shut it off.
You can't tell me what I was born into.

3601
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:53,760
I think if you're 14 you're born this
way.

3602
02:24:53,761 --> 02:24:55,710
You're born a dreary nit picker.

3603
02:24:58,130 --> 02:24:59,670
Oh,
you're trying to make it so I'm a

3604
02:24:59,671 --> 02:25:01,660
fucking creeper like you.
I'm not,

3605
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:04,960
I'm not in the 14 year olds.
How dare you know?

3606
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:08,430
He's a 14 year old fucking,
the guy that you said is a great guy.

3607
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:11,880
He was in a 14 year old stick.
Terrible person.

3608
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:15,240
No,
surely when I was a very mature 14 year

3609
02:25:15,241 --> 02:25:16,074
old.
Yeah.

3610
02:25:16,110 --> 02:25:17,220
Well,
in your case,

3611
02:25:17,221 --> 02:25:20,190
he got it right.
You've got the right guy to molest.

3612
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,200
It wasn't molestation and that's
absolutely,

3613
02:25:22,201 --> 02:25:23,980
most of the station is perfectly
consensual.

3614
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,860
I don't think it is when they're 14 when
I was 14 trust me,

3615
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:29,410
I was the predator.
I was the Predator,

3616
02:25:29,630 --> 02:25:33,340
the Predator chasing after the crease.
He's trying to stay close to God,

3617
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:37,000
seeing everybody I was,
I was aggressively seeking out sexual

3618
02:25:37,001 --> 02:25:40,300
company of adults because I knew it
would horrify people because I wanted

3619
02:25:40,301 --> 02:25:41,200
sort of power over them.

3620
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:43,660
It was my way of rebelling,
my way of rebelling.

3621
02:25:43,661 --> 02:25:45,820
I was,
I was the Predator of 14 let me tell

3622
02:25:45,821 --> 02:25:47,110
you,
do you think that's what's going on with

3623
02:25:47,111 --> 02:25:49,960
that guy who directed x men?
Bunch of Bryan singer,

3624
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:52,300
a bunch of 14 year old predators.
Yeah.

3625
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:53,350
After that.
Poor man.

3626
02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:55,330
I,
I'm not sure it's the case with him.

3627
02:25:55,470 --> 02:26:00,470
No,
that's a guy know I lived in Hollywood a

3628
02:26:00,910 --> 02:26:03,880
while ago briefly.
And did you go to one of his parties?

3629
02:26:04,650 --> 02:26:08,890
I went to other people who I won't name
of a similar stature in Hollywood.

3630
02:26:08,891 --> 02:26:11,950
I went to the both parties into their
house parties and things and some of the

3631
02:26:11,951 --> 02:26:14,140
things I have seen,
it beggars belief.

3632
02:26:14,310 --> 02:26:16,150
Yeah.
Can you give us like a,

3633
02:26:16,990 --> 02:26:18,320
well,
just,

3634
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:20,860
I can't,
I don't want to be indiscreet about

3635
02:26:20,861 --> 02:26:24,430
specific people because I think it's
going to dance around the facts.

3636
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:25,630
Yeah.
Dangerous.

3637
02:26:25,631 --> 02:26:27,670
But I can tell you the truth without
dropping anyone in it.

3638
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,530
Okay.
And some of the boys that were very

3639
02:26:29,531 --> 02:26:31,270
young,
very young,

3640
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:33,680
I don't necessarily remember,
no,

3641
02:26:33,681 --> 02:26:34,031
no.
Like,

3642
02:26:34,031 --> 02:26:34,864
I don't know,
eight years ago,

3643
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:36,100
um,
I don't,

3644
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:43,450
I don't remember
whether I ever met Bryan singer or

3645
02:26:43,451 --> 02:26:46,660
whatever or even knew who he was then.
But I knew other people of similar

3646
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:47,740
stature,
as I say.

3647
02:26:47,741 --> 02:26:50,020
And there were some very young boys
around at that time.

3648
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:54,610
There was a lot of drugs and a lot of,
a lot of twinks taking drugs and having

3649
02:26:54,611 --> 02:26:57,160
unsafe sex with older men.
And some of these boys were very young,

3650
02:26:57,161 --> 02:26:58,810
desperate,
desperate for a job.

3651
02:26:58,840 --> 02:27:00,220
You know,
when Andy Cohen,

3652
02:27:00,221 --> 02:27:03,400
the Guy Runs Bravo,
had apologize for the use of the word

3653
02:27:03,401 --> 02:27:06,760
twink apologize for Twain.
I thought that was one of the most

3654
02:27:06,761 --> 02:27:08,920
adorable things.
Gay,

3655
02:27:09,550 --> 02:27:10,150
gay as fuck.

3656
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:13,390
And he said the word twink and he had to
apologize because what?

3657
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:15,100
Cause it was demeaning to somebody
starts,

3658
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:18,430
someone was like a perfect twink and he
made like a social media comment.

3659
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:21,430
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong with that.

3660
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:22,540
I got you.
See this,

3661
02:27:22,550 --> 02:27:25,660
this is the thing you see,
the progressive's are starting to police

3662
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:26,890
homosexuals lang.
You know,

3663
02:27:26,891 --> 02:27:28,480
I've got this theory right.
Um,

3664
02:27:28,810 --> 02:27:29,860
I believe that,
um,

3665
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:33,430
pedophilia is the next progressive
rehabilitation drive.

3666
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:36,670
But I also think that straight,
sorry,

3667
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:41,410
that homosexual white guys are going to
be put back into the establishment

3668
02:27:41,411 --> 02:27:44,790
bucket very soon.
If you look at some of the whining

3669
02:27:44,830 --> 02:27:46,600
editorials coming out was like the daily
beast,

3670
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:48,670
um,
this female female columnist and the

3671
02:27:48,671 --> 02:27:52,840
daily beast who will,
who will publish things about seeing it

3672
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:55,990
on your Grindr profile,
this app that you use to pick up guys

3673
02:27:55,991 --> 02:27:58,000
nearby,
which is best just to see if torsos and

3674
02:27:58,001 --> 02:27:59,260
you just pick or you want to get fucked
by

3675
02:28:00,860 --> 02:28:01,693
its correct.

3676
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:05,170
Jesus would've planned that.
I feel like the iPhone and I don't use

3677
02:28:05,171 --> 02:28:06,580
it for that reason,
not for that reason.

3678
02:28:06,670 --> 02:28:07,660
I don't use these.
I don't need to.

3679
02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:09,160
Um,
but uh,

3680
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:10,110
on that,
um,

3681
02:28:10,510 --> 02:28:12,940
on the APP,
some people say whites only.

3682
02:28:12,970 --> 02:28:15,700
Some people say only Hispanics.
People just express their sexual

3683
02:28:15,701 --> 02:28:16,990
preference.
Everybody has a sexual preference.

3684
02:28:16,991 --> 02:28:18,730
It's perfectly reasonable.
But of course,

3685
02:28:18,731 --> 02:28:20,770
you know,
there's some progressive column is just

3686
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:24,170
finally like five years later as
cottoned onto this and decided to make a

3687
02:28:24,171 --> 02:28:26,360
thing about it and said,
problematic that gay people express

3688
02:28:26,361 --> 02:28:28,010
racial preferences in dating.
Of course it isn't.

3689
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:32,210
We will have the Okcupid data actually
shows us which racism,

3690
02:28:32,211 --> 02:28:33,130
which genders,
um,

3691
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,460
you know,
come out on top and come out of the

3692
02:28:34,461 --> 02:28:37,040
bottoms like Asian women do very well,
black women really badly.

3693
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:37,940
Um,
you know,

3694
02:28:37,940 --> 02:28:42,660
and the sort of league tables of,
of of hotness a minimum.

3695
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:43,680
Anyway.
Um,

3696
02:28:44,390 --> 02:28:46,640
so the sign to police the language now
and there's police,

3697
02:28:46,641 --> 02:28:50,900
the sexuality of homosexuals.
I mean there was me thinking we were

3698
02:28:50,901 --> 02:28:54,740
sliding dangerously close to tolerance
and understanding and now progressive's

3699
02:28:54,741 --> 02:28:56,540
are starting to police the sexuality of
homosexuals again.

3700
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:57,950
Um,
very interesting.

3701
02:28:57,980 --> 02:29:01,560
There's a game of Gotcha though.
It's a chemo scarred shirts so they

3702
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:04,170
don't really,
they're not really upset that they're

3703
02:29:04,190 --> 02:29:06,170
not upset.
They're looking for something to

3704
02:29:06,171 --> 02:29:08,810
complain about.
But the problem with the prom with

3705
02:29:08,811 --> 02:29:09,770
outrage culture,
I mean,

3706
02:29:09,771 --> 02:29:11,060
I've always said the only part where
age,

3707
02:29:11,061 --> 02:29:12,230
culture is what it is,
right.

3708
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:15,440
And the problem without any way to
approach outrage culture,

3709
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,820
which is what I do,
is to be outrageous,

3710
02:29:16,821 --> 02:29:19,550
right?
Say Ridiculous and outrageous things

3711
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:24,170
simply to draw attention to the people
to get upset about it.

3712
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:26,870
I think it's a very important project
and it's what I do in a lot of my

3713
02:29:26,871 --> 02:29:27,210
columns.

3714
02:29:27,210 --> 02:29:28,910
That's what I do on Twitter.
I've done it a little bit today.

3715
02:29:29,190 --> 02:29:31,400
Um,
and I think it's very important to wait

3716
02:29:31,401 --> 02:29:33,830
a minute.
You've done a little bit of it today.

3717
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:35,930
I've been outrageous.
Haven't said anything I believe,

3718
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:38,300
but I've been outrageous.
Going to read you something outrageous,

3719
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:40,130
little bit outrageous.
Um,

3720
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:42,230
just a little bit.
I've turned myself down for you.

3721
02:29:42,231 --> 02:29:45,990
Cause I know,
can heterosexual lump lumping Cretia

3722
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:48,670
threatened me?
No,

3723
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:50,150
I've,
I've,

3724
02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:52,640
I've taken,
I've toned myself down with you today,

3725
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:53,700
but,
um,

3726
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:54,550
no,
I,

3727
02:29:54,660 --> 02:29:57,170
I very,
very firm believer that the only

3728
02:29:57,171 --> 02:29:58,880
appropriate response to outreach culture
is to be outrageous.

3729
02:29:58,881 --> 02:30:00,620
But the problem with outreach culture is
that,

3730
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:02,750
uh,
because these people are all basically

3731
02:30:02,751 --> 02:30:03,930
quite thick,
um,

3732
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:07,430
they tend to move in herds and so
outreach culture can have,

3733
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:08,900
um,
trends,

3734
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:10,400
you know,
and so,

3735
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:12,200
uh,
people can sort of cottoned onto a

3736
02:30:12,201 --> 02:30:14,900
particular idea and suddenly everybody's
outraged about the same thing.

3737
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:18,130
And I see ahead of us,
um,

3738
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:21,680
sort of policing of the culture of
heterosexual gay men,

3739
02:30:22,130 --> 02:30:23,090
heterosexual,
gay,

3740
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:23,511
sorry.
Sorry,

3741
02:30:23,511 --> 02:30:24,430
sorry.
Sorry.

3742
02:30:24,431 --> 02:30:26,540
Of of white gay men.
Um,

3743
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:28,840
on the basis that they have,
uh,

3744
02:30:28,930 --> 02:30:30,680
almost like the ultimate male privilege,
you know,

3745
02:30:30,681 --> 02:30:33,650
they're not there.
They are smarter and richer and better

3746
02:30:33,651 --> 02:30:35,880
looking and Saskia and,
uh,

3747
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:38,060
all the things that feminists hate
because feminists are none of those

3748
02:30:38,061 --> 02:30:40,410
things as feminists are
disproportionately poor and ugly and

3749
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:41,720
unlovable.
Um,

3750
02:30:41,810 --> 02:30:44,390
and uh,
and they disproportionately poor.

3751
02:30:44,790 --> 02:30:45,500
Yes.
Yes.

3752
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:45,831
Because,
well,

3753
02:30:45,831 --> 02:30:49,730
because the liberals
put me in a poor,

3754
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:50,660
ugly,
miserable,

3755
02:30:50,661 --> 02:30:52,370
broken people are much more likely to
become liberal.

3756
02:30:52,580 --> 02:30:54,980
What's the percentage that don't have a
natural hair color?

3757
02:30:55,370 --> 02:30:56,400
Oh,
close to a hundred.

3758
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:58,820
Do you know,
do you know I've got,

3759
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:01,730
I went to this,
I went to the salon today and I said,

3760
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:02,583
Gee,
I'm going on.

3761
02:31:02,730 --> 02:31:04,820
I'm waiting on this show.
I think it'd be really funny if you gave

3762
02:31:04,821 --> 02:31:06,530
me like blue hair cause we can make a
joke out of it.

3763
02:31:06,531 --> 02:31:07,680
And he just looked at me and went,
no,

3764
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,080
you're too handsome guys.
18 eight on Santa Monica.

3765
02:31:12,310 --> 02:31:13,131
Um,
no,

3766
02:31:13,131 --> 02:31:14,990
I thought it was nice.
That gave me a lot spring in my step.

3767
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:17,090
That's beautiful.
No,

3768
02:31:17,091 --> 02:31:18,410
I'm not doing that to you.
You're too good looking.

3769
02:31:18,660 --> 02:31:20,070
I really know.
It's adorable.

3770
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:20,881
I know.
I know.

3771
02:31:20,881 --> 02:31:22,050
I know.
I tips huge.

3772
02:31:22,051 --> 02:31:24,450
Which I guess was the point.
I guess it was the point he was,

3773
02:31:24,650 --> 02:31:26,340
he was gunning for.
Um,

3774
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:29,340
he also gave me my first,
you'll appreciate this as a real man.

3775
02:31:29,530 --> 02:31:31,450
Um,
he gave him my first ever cutthroat

3776
02:31:31,550 --> 02:31:32,291
shave.
Oh,

3777
02:31:32,291 --> 02:31:33,450
well,
it's one of those straight razors.

3778
02:31:33,451 --> 02:31:33,871
Yeah.
Yeah.

3779
02:31:33,871 --> 02:31:36,240
I've never had it done before.
I felt like I became a man today.

3780
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:39,630
Real men don't do that because you don't
trust a man with a fucking razor blade.

3781
02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:42,330
You don't need because you've got it.
There's no,

3782
02:31:42,390 --> 02:31:43,680
there's no maneuver where you can get
it.

3783
02:31:43,690 --> 02:31:45,480
Yeah.
You don't want it like a martial art.

3784
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:46,680
There's no,
she's fucking crazy.

3785
02:31:46,970 --> 02:31:48,030
Yeah.
Where there was a guy,

3786
02:31:48,031 --> 02:31:51,570
I believe it was in San Diego that just
slit someone's throat for no reason.

3787
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:54,130
Just went crazy and just went crazy.
Yeah.

3788
02:31:54,590 --> 02:31:56,790
And they arrested him.
The person lived though,

3789
02:31:56,791 --> 02:31:58,340
but they're fucked up.
I,

3790
02:31:58,410 --> 02:32:01,320
they have surgery and like,
he's a guy just sliced open their

3791
02:32:01,321 --> 02:32:05,160
throat.
I was petrified that he would slip or

3792
02:32:05,161 --> 02:32:07,820
that someone would make him jump or
somebody would just come in the store.

3793
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:10,290
It's like turning around and get
earthquakes here.

3794
02:32:10,350 --> 02:32:12,540
Cut My throat open,
you know,

3795
02:32:12,550 --> 02:32:15,750
they can just get a razor.
I watched San Andreas earthquake,

3796
02:32:15,751 --> 02:32:19,560
so I watched San Dress on a plane over
what happens to San Francisco is just

3797
02:32:19,561 --> 02:32:20,320
awful really?

3798
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:21,450
And so dress.
Yeah,

3799
02:32:21,451 --> 02:32:23,760
it's just terrible.
It's awful to see San Francisco brain

3800
02:32:23,761 --> 02:32:26,820
when you watch that movie is even worse.
I like him.

3801
02:32:26,821 --> 02:32:28,920
What's his name?
Yeah,

3802
02:32:28,921 --> 02:32:30,240
he's great.
He's awesome.

3803
02:32:30,241 --> 02:32:32,460
I'm a fan actually.
I've seen pretty much everything he's

3804
02:32:32,461 --> 02:32:34,020
been in.
And do you know what that movie,

3805
02:32:34,021 --> 02:32:36,210
he's actually kind of good actor in
that,

3806
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:38,640
like he's quiet,
but like with this stuff with his

3807
02:32:38,641 --> 02:32:41,640
daughter at the beginning when the mom's
moving into the house with the new guy

3808
02:32:41,641 --> 02:32:43,260
who did the boss did,
he runs away.

3809
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:46,410
Motherfucker,
I need your phones away and leaves her

3810
02:32:46,411 --> 02:32:47,760
in the course.
He does pussy.

3811
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:50,930
What happens when probably British acts
pretty it.

3812
02:32:50,931 --> 02:32:52,590
British actor.
They're always about going male feminist

3813
02:32:52,591 --> 02:32:54,450
palsy.
Probably male feminist.

3814
02:32:54,451 --> 02:32:55,440
Yeah.
Uh,

3815
02:32:55,530 --> 02:32:57,120
and um,
no,

3816
02:32:57,121 --> 02:33:00,130
and I thought his acting was subtle.
I thought it was really point.

3817
02:33:00,220 --> 02:33:02,760
I thought it was a great performance,
but it was great.

3818
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:04,170
It was great.
I can do everything you want.

3819
02:33:04,250 --> 02:33:05,580
It's pretty cool.
That movie sucked.

3820
02:33:07,010 --> 02:33:11,460
I just liked seeing San Francisco,
like pummeled with waves,

3821
02:33:11,670 --> 02:33:13,470
too many games,
natural disasters,

3822
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:17,400
the solid self hate that you could be.
You could be,

3823
02:33:17,430 --> 02:33:19,050
you,
you'd like to be there in an orgy when

3824
02:33:19,051 --> 02:33:22,260
the big one hits God,
take me away.

3825
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,480
Well,
maybe taking another way of earthquakes.

3826
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:26,880
Tsunami,
San Francisco.

3827
02:33:26,881 --> 02:33:31,881
So all evil in America that comes in
your butt tsunami takes you away.

3828
02:33:32,590 --> 02:33:36,340
I've never been propelled forward by it.
Not yet.

3829
02:33:36,790 --> 02:33:38,050
Yeah.
First time for everything.

3830
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:39,660
Maybe we,
I dunno,

3831
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:41,220
you're in San Francisco,
so yeah,

3832
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:44,780
that's how we do it though.
Some street fat you'd get propels and I

3833
02:33:44,781 --> 02:33:49,350
think get repelled.
Just the viral load that's inside that

3834
02:33:49,351 --> 02:33:51,480
person's body.
Boom.

3835
02:33:51,690 --> 02:33:55,800
I always wanted to just have days at t
on tap in the hipster bars in San

3836
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,210
Francisco for the ECT.
Really worked.

3837
02:33:57,240 --> 02:34:00,300
That was like the big conspiracy.
That AZT was a cancer medication,

3838
02:34:00,301 --> 02:34:02,520
that they were using an aids when they
thought it was the gay cancer.

3839
02:34:02,521 --> 02:34:04,080
They stopped AZT a long,
long,

3840
02:34:04,081 --> 02:34:05,600
long time ago.
My,

3841
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:10,820
so much so that there was a kindness,
my gauge of sort of like 80s bigotry.

3842
02:34:11,131 --> 02:34:14,670
I'm totally,
I'm totally out of date or my gay hate.

3843
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:17,730
There was a guy named Peter though

3844
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,830
I had him on the podcast and Mandy's
very few people I've ever had on the

3845
02:34:20,831 --> 02:34:23,980
podcast that brought so much hate with
them.

3846
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:26,800
But yeah,
he is a biologist at the University of

3847
02:34:26,801 --> 02:34:27,850
California,
Berkeley,

3848
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:31,150
uh,
tenured fucking professor up there who,

3849
02:34:31,151 --> 02:34:35,620
uh,
believed that HIV did not cause aids and

3850
02:34:35,621 --> 02:34:38,620
that what HIV was,
was a weak virus that,

3851
02:34:38,660 --> 02:34:41,170
uh,
only existed in the bodies of people

3852
02:34:41,171 --> 02:34:43,240
that already had compromised immune
systems.

3853
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:48,400
And he said the correlation between
partying and a party drugs,

3854
02:34:48,401 --> 02:34:50,640
crystal meth dream and all this
different shit.

3855
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:54,490
This is what drives you into the eye.
It's just what could crushes your immune

3856
02:34:54,491 --> 02:34:56,200
system.
It's really amazing.

3857
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:59,860
Academics believe we have this
extraordinary reverence for science and

3858
02:34:59,861 --> 02:35:00,571
of course we do,
right?

3859
02:35:00,571 --> 02:35:01,050
Yeah.

3860
02:35:01,050 --> 02:35:03,450
Because it's what tells us mostly about
how the world works.

3861
02:35:03,451 --> 02:35:04,640
Python I've see from,
you know,

3862
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:06,310
the transcendental bits that are
actually met her.

3863
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:07,680
Uh,
but it tells us,

3864
02:35:08,340 --> 02:35:10,410
it tells us so much about how the world
functions,

3865
02:35:10,411 --> 02:35:11,790
you know,
like what's going to happen if I do

3866
02:35:11,791 --> 02:35:12,451
that?
Uh,

3867
02:35:12,451 --> 02:35:13,650
you know,
science tells us all these things,

3868
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:14,880
right?
And,

3869
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:16,680
um,
so we have this,

3870
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:18,340
I suppose,
appropriate reverence for scientists,

3871
02:35:18,341 --> 02:35:23,341
but what we always forget is just how
mentor and fallible and in many cases

3872
02:35:23,791 --> 02:35:25,380
unintelligence then many of them are.
Yeah.

3873
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:26,440
Oh,
there people,

3874
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:28,840
they vary so widely to change stuff.
You know,

3875
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:32,680
dark secret that I never tell anyone,
which I'm going to reveal to you.

3876
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:34,540
You don't believe in climate change.
Oh No,

3877
02:35:34,541 --> 02:35:35,321
no.
I'm perfectly happy,

3878
02:35:35,321 --> 02:35:38,200
but I haven't even met McClemmits first
motherfucker.

3879
02:35:38,230 --> 02:35:39,850
No,
I don't believe in manmade climate

3880
02:35:39,851 --> 02:35:41,770
change at all.
But you don't know.

3881
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:43,270
You don't believe in it?
No,

3882
02:35:43,271 --> 02:35:44,320
I don't think it's,
I don't think,

3883
02:35:44,321 --> 02:35:46,540
I don't think we are affecting the
climate significantly.

3884
02:35:46,610 --> 02:35:47,890
No,
no,

3885
02:35:47,891 --> 02:35:48,970
no.
So all those scientists,

3886
02:35:48,971 --> 02:35:50,110
they don't know what the fuck they're
talking about.

3887
02:35:50,111 --> 02:35:51,220
Well,
this is my dark secret.

3888
02:35:52,020 --> 02:35:54,960
So for two years,
nobody knows this.

3889
02:35:54,961 --> 02:35:55,771
I'm going to lose.
I'm going to,

3890
02:35:55,771 --> 02:35:58,230
this is going to be the,
my last shred of conservative

3891
02:35:58,231 --> 02:36:00,120
credibility.
Gone off to this show.

3892
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:03,030
I worked for a climate change NGO.
Uh,

3893
02:36:03,150 --> 02:36:07,320
and um,
I saw at the u I went to the UN,

3894
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:11,010
I was in the front row for Al Gore
speech host in Barley,

3895
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:12,840
let,
all the UN stuff.

3896
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:17,380
I went to all their events and I saw
firsthand just what a load of what a

3897
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:19,320
crock of shit.
So much of it is really,

3898
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:20,903
I mean,
look,

3899
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:25,080
we now know the IPC reports in the UN
are total horse shit.

3900
02:36:25,081 --> 02:36:27,720
Lead authors are asking for the names to
be removed from them now because they've

3901
02:36:27,721 --> 02:36:30,390
turned into just into ideological
political documents.

3902
02:36:30,391 --> 02:36:32,580
They have no basis in climate science
whatsoever anymore.

3903
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:34,090
But even in the early days when,
uh,

3904
02:36:34,170 --> 02:36:37,830
when they were supposedly better,
I saw,

3905
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:41,220
um,
papering over of data.

3906
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:43,830
I was asked to do it and I didn't.
I saw,

3907
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:45,960
um,
people emitting,

3908
02:36:46,010 --> 02:36:47,010
uh,
uh,

3909
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,590
data sets that didn't fit with the,
with the,

3910
02:36:49,591 --> 02:36:51,230
um,
uh,

3911
02:36:51,270 --> 02:36:54,590
hypotheses.
I saw people getting reports,

3912
02:36:54,690 --> 02:36:56,970
some scientists,
and rewording them to make them more

3913
02:36:56,971 --> 02:36:59,010
extreme and more alarmist.
I saw all of this happened,

3914
02:36:59,430 --> 02:37:01,440
um,
and I saw all this happen in multiple

3915
02:37:01,470 --> 02:37:03,810
organizations whose sole purpose was to,
was to,

3916
02:37:03,910 --> 02:37:06,180
um,
the extremist about climate change.

3917
02:37:06,510 --> 02:37:09,660
And I,
I came to believe that the whole thing

3918
02:37:09,661 --> 02:37:10,494
was,
um,

3919
02:37:10,550 --> 02:37:11,850
was a crock of shit and I left

3920
02:37:13,330 --> 02:37:15,180
quit.
Do you think that what happened?

3921
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:16,130
I mean,
I

3922
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:17,570
know very,
very,

3923
02:37:17,571 --> 02:37:20,090
very little on this.
I'm just gonna just take this at face

3924
02:37:20,091 --> 02:37:21,890
value and just debate you and not in
debate.

3925
02:37:21,891 --> 02:37:23,310
You just ask you questions.
Yeah.

3926
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:27,740
Do you think that what is happening is
that an industry has been created?

3927
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:31,520
Uh,
and that certainly is true that there is

3928
02:37:31,521 --> 02:37:33,440
an industry,
I'm not going to suggest that the whole

3929
02:37:33,470 --> 02:37:37,160
climate change establishment as a result
of some people rent seeking where there

3930
02:37:37,161 --> 02:37:39,110
is some of that going on,
but there is definitely a climate change

3931
02:37:39,111 --> 02:37:40,070
industry.
There's no doubt about it.

3932
02:37:40,100 --> 02:37:42,290
Right.
And it also is one,

3933
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:45,980
it's something that if you,
it's like saying that you don't believe

3934
02:37:45,981 --> 02:37:47,600
in vaccines.
No,

3935
02:37:47,601 --> 02:37:48,740
I don't think it's the same.
You look,

3936
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:49,250
but,
um,

3937
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:51,290
but it is to public opinion.
No,

3938
02:37:51,291 --> 02:37:52,220
I don't think that's true.
I think,

3939
02:37:52,221 --> 02:37:53,054
I don't think so.
Opinion.

3940
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:54,160
Well,
you never hear about it because the

3941
02:37:54,161 --> 02:37:59,090
media will never dare tell you a bit
more skeptical about many of the same

3942
02:37:59,091 --> 02:38:01,450
people who don't believe in climate
change also.

3943
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:03,530
Anti-Vaxxers right.
But I don't think these two things have

3944
02:38:03,531 --> 02:38:04,710
anything in common.
And one of them is right.

3945
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:06,110
One them is wrong.
Um,

3946
02:38:06,140 --> 02:38:08,540
you know which one's wrong?
Anti-Vaxxers right.

3947
02:38:09,650 --> 02:38:11,540
Or rule should vaccinate their children.
Right?

3948
02:38:11,930 --> 02:38:14,230
And climate changes bunk.
Um,

3949
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:17,390
but if you need to say that,
you don't need to believe in climate

3950
02:38:17,391 --> 02:38:20,160
change,
a lot of times the same sort of

3951
02:38:20,161 --> 02:38:22,170
believing Wacko.
I don't care what they bought,

3952
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:24,350
lump me in with.
I care about facts not being,

3953
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:26,690
you know,
not whether somebody lumps me in with

3954
02:38:26,691 --> 02:38:28,580
the wrong group of people.
I've never cared about that.

3955
02:38:28,581 --> 02:38:30,620
I don't care what people think about me.
I care whether,

3956
02:38:30,621 --> 02:38:33,620
whether my argument is sounded,
whether I'm right or whether I'm funny

3957
02:38:33,621 --> 02:38:34,760
and entertaining people like me.
But,

3958
02:38:34,870 --> 02:38:36,470
um,
I don't care if somebody,

3959
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:37,700
you know,
but people are people,

3960
02:38:37,701 --> 02:38:39,260
right?
Guys like us off all the time.

3961
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:39,700
Right?
They said,

3962
02:38:39,700 --> 02:38:41,320
write me,
I was in Miss [inaudible] self-loathing,

3963
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:43,670
homosexuals you did.
You did today on wrongly,

3964
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:47,360
you know people do this all the time and
it's just another way that the left has

3965
02:38:47,390 --> 02:38:49,610
of dealers utilizing the speaker because
they don't like the arguments.

3966
02:38:49,611 --> 02:38:52,410
Rather than take the argument you called
the speaker self-loathing rather than

3967
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:54,970
take the argument you call the speaker,
you know a bigger to have some other

3968
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:56,100
kind,
you know what,

3969
02:38:56,120 --> 02:39:00,200
what all you pathologize you say that if
you're a gay person with these opinions

3970
02:39:00,201 --> 02:39:03,380
you must either have like some
psychological problem and you get for

3971
02:39:03,390 --> 02:39:06,410
you need therapy or you hate yourself
and your self loathing because of your

3972
02:39:06,411 --> 02:39:09,620
religious upbringing or the rest of it.
You don't allow that person the dignity

3973
02:39:09,830 --> 02:39:12,680
of having opinions that don't correspond
with their sexuality.

3974
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:16,730
That I think is cheap and it ignores the
messy and complicated reality of human

3975
02:39:16,731 --> 02:39:17,870
sexuality and who people are.

3976
02:39:18,470 --> 02:39:21,440
I don't care if somebody thinks that I'm
a self loathing homosexual.

3977
02:39:21,441 --> 02:39:23,630
What I care about is,
is telling the truth that other people

3978
02:39:23,631 --> 02:39:26,940
seem to be reluctant to do gay people,
the gay establishment and uh,

3979
02:39:26,980 --> 02:39:28,970
you know,
certainly doesn't tell the truth about a

3980
02:39:28,971 --> 02:39:30,410
lot of things.
They don't tell the truth about born

3981
02:39:30,411 --> 02:39:31,940
this way.
They don't tell the truth about HIV.

3982
02:39:31,941 --> 02:39:33,830
They get very upset when you dare to
told,

3983
02:39:34,010 --> 02:39:35,600
you know,
I wrote this column like you know,

3984
02:39:35,601 --> 02:39:37,390
gay people,
if you want to start donating blood,

3985
02:39:37,391 --> 02:39:39,440
cause most gay people,
gay people are banned from donating

3986
02:39:39,441 --> 02:39:40,170
blood,
you know,

3987
02:39:40,170 --> 02:39:44,990
or at least it's very difficult in the
UK and I think the u s too,

3988
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:47,000
and I wrote this column,
so if you want it to gay people are

3989
02:39:47,001 --> 02:39:49,010
complaining that they're not allowed to
donate blood and they said that it's,

3990
02:39:49,011 --> 02:39:50,600
you know,
evidence of homophobia,

3991
02:39:50,601 --> 02:39:50,780
whatever.

3992
02:39:50,780 --> 02:39:51,531
I said if you,
if you don't,

3993
02:39:51,531 --> 02:39:54,530
if you want to be able to donate,
blood stopped being sluts.

3994
02:39:54,740 --> 02:39:56,780
The reason that the,
the reason the NHS doesn't let you

3995
02:39:56,781 --> 02:39:58,250
donate blood,
it's because gay blood is so

3996
02:39:58,251 --> 02:40:00,530
disproportionately more likely to have
diseases in it.

3997
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:03,290
If you want,
if you want to be allowed to donate

3998
02:40:03,291 --> 02:40:06,560
blood,
stop sleeping around and this kind of

3999
02:40:06,561 --> 02:40:09,080
stuff,
stop sleeping around just so they can

4000
02:40:09,081 --> 02:40:09,950
give other people,
it's not,

4001
02:40:09,951 --> 02:40:11,330
but that wasn't the point.
My point was to,

4002
02:40:11,331 --> 02:40:12,170
you know,
to get it,

4003
02:40:12,171 --> 02:40:13,010
the,
the whiners,

4004
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:14,100
the winches and the social justice

4005
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:16,710
warriors and handling it.
My point is I don't care if somebody

4006
02:40:16,711 --> 02:40:17,110
says,
you know,

4007
02:40:17,110 --> 02:40:18,550
you're still floating homosexual.
I know,

4008
02:40:18,551 --> 02:40:20,670
which isn't true.
It's a cheap debate tactic.

4009
02:40:20,710 --> 02:40:22,620
Um,
and it hasn't really has no meaning

4010
02:40:22,621 --> 02:40:24,600
outside of the fact that the argument.
Um,

4011
02:40:24,630 --> 02:40:26,110
so I didn't care about being lumped in
with,

4012
02:40:26,111 --> 02:40:28,500
with crazy people.
If my arguments are sound about a

4013
02:40:28,501 --> 02:40:30,270
particular issue,
I'd rather it wasn't.

4014
02:40:30,271 --> 02:40:31,510
But you know,
Auntie Auntie,

4015
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:33,990
if you say to me,
will you come and you say,

4016
02:40:34,170 --> 02:40:36,840
I didn't believe in climate change.
And in my head I think,

4017
02:40:36,841 --> 02:40:37,621
Oh God,
you're like,

4018
02:40:37,621 --> 02:40:39,750
it can get crazy info wars conspiracy
theorist.

4019
02:40:39,751 --> 02:40:40,890
You're an Alex Jones type,
right?

4020
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:43,680
Who probably thinks vaccines are a
conspiracy by the government.

4021
02:40:43,890 --> 02:40:46,470
Um,
I find that absurd.

4022
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:49,350
And in any case,
I don't really mind too much because I

4023
02:40:49,351 --> 02:40:52,020
think,
I think ordinary people,

4024
02:40:52,110 --> 02:40:57,110
I think many of your fans and certainly
mine are a bit tired of having labels

4025
02:40:57,211 --> 02:40:58,470
applied to them by other people.

4026
02:40:58,740 --> 02:41:02,100
I think people are a bit tired of being
told what they are that told their

4027
02:41:02,101 --> 02:41:03,450
bigoted,
told them a sergeant stick,

4028
02:41:03,451 --> 02:41:04,980
told the um,
you know,

4029
02:41:04,981 --> 02:41:07,590
that there is something else wrong with
them or that they have the wrong

4030
02:41:07,591 --> 02:41:09,480
opinions about things.
I think people are a bit sick of that

4031
02:41:09,481 --> 02:41:10,470
actually.
Um,

4032
02:41:10,570 --> 02:41:12,800
and
uh,

4033
02:41:12,930 --> 02:41:13,860
indeed,
um,

4034
02:41:13,890 --> 02:41:15,060
you know,
I think people are a bit bored of that.

4035
02:41:15,061 --> 02:41:17,910
So I'm very relaxed about people calling
me names because I've had it my whole

4036
02:41:17,911 --> 02:41:19,680
career and normally it's a consequence
of telling the truth.

4037
02:41:20,140 --> 02:41:21,510
Got It.
Um,

4038
02:41:21,511 --> 02:41:22,590
you know,
there's a lot of articles.

4039
02:41:22,591 --> 02:41:26,010
It's really interesting because I
googled it while you were talking about

4040
02:41:26,300 --> 02:41:26,941
the,
you know,

4041
02:41:26,941 --> 02:41:29,700
there's a quote that gets bandied around
a lot,

4042
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:34,320
a 97% of climate scientists agree.
And,

4043
02:41:34,321 --> 02:41:36,210
uh,
there's a lot of fucking articles it

4044
02:41:36,211 --> 02:41:38,970
says that's horse shit.
I don't think that's true.

4045
02:41:39,360 --> 02:41:40,910
I don't think that's ever been true.
I think the 97,

4046
02:41:41,070 --> 02:41:45,450
I think that 97% of climate scientists
agreeing on climate change is in the

4047
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:47,670
same category of,
um,

4048
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:50,820
of immortal myth that the campus rape
culture,

4049
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:52,620
statistically,
it's one of those sort of unquestioned,

4050
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,030
it's like a,
it's become a,

4051
02:41:54,300 --> 02:41:56,730
it's become a,
a fact meme,

4052
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:57,610
you know?
Uh,

4053
02:41:57,610 --> 02:42:00,630
it's one of those things as uncritically
reported and it's been repeated so many

4054
02:42:00,631 --> 02:42:03,270
times that people don't even feel the
need to us for a citation anymore.

4055
02:42:03,550 --> 02:42:05,430
And so for example,
when you hear this stuff about the rape

4056
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:08,820
rape statistics or the pay gap,
people take it,

4057
02:42:08,850 --> 02:42:12,390
it's such an established part of
accepted a statistic.

4058
02:42:12,391 --> 02:42:16,500
Now people's have stopped bothering to
ask for evidence to justify it.

4059
02:42:16,740 --> 02:42:17,830
I don't think it was ever true.
Then.

4060
02:42:17,831 --> 02:42:22,200
I just 7% well,
you would know probably better than a

4061
02:42:22,201 --> 02:42:25,710
lot because you were actually there on
the front lines and you watched people

4062
02:42:25,711 --> 02:42:30,711
actually fuck with evidence and omit
things and add things and,

4063
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:32,750
well,
what,

4064
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:34,770
what was the,
when,

4065
02:42:34,790 --> 02:42:36,360
when you were there,
and this was all going on,

4066
02:42:36,361 --> 02:42:38,430
like what was the philosophy behind
politics?

4067
02:42:38,460 --> 02:42:40,260
It's all politics.
Climate change has never been about

4068
02:42:40,261 --> 02:42:41,520
science.
It's always a bit about politics.

4069
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:42,630
Um,
you know,

4070
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:43,441
and this is,
this is,

4071
02:42:43,441 --> 02:42:45,540
this is when right wing or sometimes
sound a bit conspiratorial,

4072
02:42:45,541 --> 02:42:46,101
a bit crazy,
right?

4073
02:42:46,101 --> 02:42:46,511
Won't miss it.
Oh,

4074
02:42:46,511 --> 02:42:47,500
it's all construction.
The liberal.

4075
02:42:47,501 --> 02:42:49,830
So 97% of scientist is a construction of
liberals.

4076
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:50,970
Just guests get out.
Right.

4077
02:42:51,150 --> 02:42:55,590
I understand how that conversational
moment comes to happen,

4078
02:42:56,070 --> 02:42:59,490
but my more I can tell you is that it
was climate change for me as an

4079
02:42:59,491 --> 02:43:02,950
observer.
Lu for the scientists concern,

4080
02:43:02,951 --> 02:43:06,860
it was primarily a political project.
It was a lot to do with the,

4081
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:10,380
the sort of UN global guilt about
poverty and the third world climate

4082
02:43:10,381 --> 02:43:11,950
change was this issue.
We're going to fix everything,

4083
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,690
right?
It was going to fix poverty in third

4084
02:43:13,691 --> 02:43:14,620
world.
Uh,

4085
02:43:14,621 --> 02:43:16,750
you know,
it's finally addressed the sort of white

4086
02:43:16,751 --> 02:43:18,310
guilt.
They all feel and gave them all a real

4087
02:43:18,311 --> 02:43:20,020
reason to feel bad about being who they
are.

4088
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:20,890
Um,
you know,

4089
02:43:20,890 --> 02:43:22,000
it gave them that,
uh,

4090
02:43:22,001 --> 02:43:24,220
that sort of terrible,
um,

4091
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:27,370
you know,
you get it gave them the justification

4092
02:43:27,371 --> 02:43:29,260
to beat up on capitalism,
which they all hate,

4093
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:31,130
gave them a justification to beat up on,
you know,

4094
02:43:31,131 --> 02:43:33,020
a western way of life.
And my James Delingpole,

4095
02:43:33,110 --> 02:43:36,220
my Breitbach colleague wrote a book
about watermelons green on the outside,

4096
02:43:36,221 --> 02:43:39,100
red on the red on the inside.
And his point was that his thesis is

4097
02:43:39,101 --> 02:43:39,640
that,
you know,

4098
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:42,370
dressed up in the language of
environmentalism and climate change

4099
02:43:42,371 --> 02:43:45,480
concern is actually just socialism,
you know,

4100
02:43:45,550 --> 02:43:47,580
anti-capitalism uh,
it's sort of this,

4101
02:43:47,581 --> 02:43:49,060
this weird,
an archaic,

4102
02:43:49,290 --> 02:43:50,790
um,
desire to see cds.

4103
02:43:50,830 --> 02:43:55,270
The
developed world burn on the part of very

4104
02:43:55,271 --> 02:43:57,010
politicized scientist.
And I have to say,

4105
02:43:57,220 --> 02:43:58,690
based on what I saw,
he's right.

4106
02:43:59,490 --> 02:44:01,740
Well,
it still seems like it's a very high

4107
02:44:01,741 --> 02:44:03,660
number when they're breaking down.
Um,

4108
02:44:03,690 --> 02:44:07,680
there's a skeptical science article
about it and they break down the actual

4109
02:44:07,681 --> 02:44:12,681
number of scientists that do believe
that we have something to do with global

4110
02:44:12,721 --> 02:44:14,490
warming.
I mean,

4111
02:44:14,491 --> 02:44:17,250
ultimately this is a large number,
but ultimately the debate pointless

4112
02:44:17,251 --> 02:44:17,800
anyway.
You know,

4113
02:44:17,800 --> 02:44:18,310
most of,
you know,

4114
02:44:18,310 --> 02:44:19,320
there,
there are a million,

4115
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:21,030
well,
top point is,

4116
02:44:21,031 --> 02:44:22,970
but it's,
there are millions of us

4117
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:24,850
was about climate change and the,
and with one Google search,

4118
02:44:24,851 --> 02:44:26,410
you can't hope to get anywhere even
close to the truth.

4119
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:29,650
But um,
in any case,

4120
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:32,650
it's a good idea to get off fossil fuels
simply because going to run out,

4121
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:34,600
it's a question of energy security,
not conservation.

4122
02:44:34,601 --> 02:44:36,940
For me,
I think for many conservatives who agree

4123
02:44:36,941 --> 02:44:40,480
that we have to find other solutions,
whether it's wind or nuclear or

4124
02:44:40,481 --> 02:44:41,380
something else,
right?

4125
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:45,550
Um,
just drilling and using up all the oil

4126
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:46,420
is going to,
I mean,

4127
02:44:46,421 --> 02:44:47,500
it's going to run out eventually,
right?

4128
02:44:47,501 --> 02:44:48,880
It's going to run out.
So we need to better select,

4129
02:44:48,910 --> 02:44:51,400
we need something else in the wings that
can take over.

4130
02:44:51,610 --> 02:44:53,680
That's,
that's not a question of ecology.

4131
02:44:53,681 --> 02:44:54,850
And that's not a political question
either.

4132
02:44:54,851 --> 02:44:57,550
It's just basic energy security,
making sure that we all have what we

4133
02:44:57,551 --> 02:45:00,610
need to survive and that we can all keep
our lights on.

4134
02:45:00,730 --> 02:45:01,810
Right.
Um,

4135
02:45:01,870 --> 02:45:03,340
so for me it's not,
you know,

4136
02:45:03,410 --> 02:45:07,210
there is a heavily politicized and I
think primarily political and not

4137
02:45:07,211 --> 02:45:09,470
scientific issue,
but um,

4138
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:12,970
we should in any case,
be pursuing renewable energy because one

4139
02:45:12,971 --> 02:45:15,190
day we're going to have to,
even with shale gas,

4140
02:45:15,191 --> 02:45:18,070
which is going to fix us for another 100
200 years or something,

4141
02:45:18,071 --> 02:45:19,900
you know,
it's going to run out eventually and we

4142
02:45:19,901 --> 02:45:21,070
are going to be around when it does.

4143
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:23,420
I believe that,
I always find it very disturbing when

4144
02:45:23,421 --> 02:45:26,480
people bring up this whole fracking
thing and they're very dismissive of it.

4145
02:45:26,481 --> 02:45:30,260
That that one freaks me out because
there's absolute evidence that they've

4146
02:45:30,350 --> 02:45:33,950
poisoned a lot of wells and there's
areas that people can't live in anymore,

4147
02:45:33,980 --> 02:45:37,700
that it's leaked into river supplies.
There's absolute evidence of that.

4148
02:45:37,701 --> 02:45:38,870
And then people like,
well,

4149
02:45:38,871 --> 02:45:40,730
the bill,
look how cheap the gas is now.

4150
02:45:40,731 --> 02:45:42,920
I'm like,
it doesn't matter if you fuck something

4151
02:45:42,921 --> 02:45:45,530
up to the point where it's useless a
hundred thousand years from now,

4152
02:45:45,531 --> 02:45:48,170
it doesn't matter.
The poisoned to river,

4153
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:49,300
it doesn't,
I mean you made it,

4154
02:45:49,430 --> 02:45:50,330
supports it.
The EPA,

4155
02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:53,000
EPA would say that doesn't mean there
shouldn't be any EPA just because they

4156
02:45:53,001 --> 02:45:54,320
fucked up and poisoned the river.
Right.

4157
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:57,740
Just because one fracking well fucked up
or even three,

4158
02:45:57,860 --> 02:46:02,860
four time fracking or 10 out of a
thousand a thousand maybe there needs to

4159
02:46:03,621 --> 02:46:06,080
be better at betting regulation.
Maybe they need to do they think maybe

4160
02:46:06,081 --> 02:46:08,780
they need to do it differently?
I guess the fracking,

4161
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:10,580
I have idea actually more than a
million.

4162
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:13,630
I've been totally out of that climate.
Energy stuff years.

4163
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:15,900
Yes.
Right now I'm going to say friendly in

4164
02:46:15,901 --> 02:46:18,030
wells and 100,000 how many million?
Well,

4165
02:46:18,031 --> 02:46:19,220
fracking worlds.
You're kidding,

4166
02:46:19,221 --> 02:46:20,060
right?
In America?

4167
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:21,980
No,
a million fracking host in America.

4168
02:46:22,580 --> 02:46:24,320
That's insane.
Yeah.

4169
02:46:24,500 --> 02:46:27,830
In America they call it possibly be.
I think it's more than that actually.

4170
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:31,590
1.1 million active tus.
Yup.

4171
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:34,460
I'm stunned,
but don't understand how my country

4172
02:46:34,461 --> 02:46:36,290
roles.
So in that case,

4173
02:46:36,410 --> 02:46:36,981
you could,
I mean,

4174
02:46:36,981 --> 02:46:39,620
you could present hundreds of examples
of poisoned rivers.

4175
02:46:39,621 --> 02:46:42,020
It will still be set,
but it still will be significantly

4176
02:46:42,021 --> 02:46:45,230
insignificant because [inaudible] still
needs that need to get in.

4177
02:46:45,231 --> 02:46:47,590
If there's 1.1 million of these wells
and you're only,

4178
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,160
you could,
and there were a hundred scare stories

4179
02:46:49,161 --> 02:46:50,930
in the media every year.
That hundred is a relatively small

4180
02:46:50,931 --> 02:46:55,040
number if you're looking at statistics.
But if you're the actual human beings

4181
02:46:55,041 --> 02:46:57,200
that live anywhere near the nuclear
power,

4182
02:46:57,201 --> 02:46:58,640
you could say people die in nuclear
accidents.

4183
02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:03,140
So let's don't have
the kind of people do.

4184
02:47:03,141 --> 02:47:05,440
But they were even that many nuclear
actually didn't even a,

4185
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:06,500
well,
they're are traction.

4186
02:47:06,860 --> 02:47:09,050
There are nuclear accidents in Japan are
Unisex since,

4187
02:47:09,051 --> 02:47:09,601
you know,
in,

4188
02:47:09,601 --> 02:47:10,434
in,
in Russia.

4189
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:13,520
Um,
well there's two and three mile island.

4190
02:47:13,550 --> 02:47:14,383
Right,
which is,

4191
02:47:14,510 --> 02:47:15,320
which is,
which is,

4192
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:16,360
well,
probably comparable,

4193
02:47:16,410 --> 02:47:18,410
comparable,
comparable in numbers of people affected

4194
02:47:18,411 --> 02:47:19,850
to your fracking thing.
No,

4195
02:47:19,851 --> 02:47:22,640
we don't live in a perfect world.
We have to make a risk assessment and a

4196
02:47:22,641 --> 02:47:25,580
judgment and also price comes into it.
You know the cost and the amount of the

4197
02:47:25,581 --> 02:47:28,880
benefit to society of getting all of
this natural gas right?

4198
02:47:28,881 --> 02:47:31,910
If a couple of rivers of poisons,
we may say that that is the best of a

4199
02:47:31,911 --> 02:47:36,230
bad set of solutions right now.
None of this stuff is perfect because we

4200
02:47:36,231 --> 02:47:38,060
don't live in mud huts.
We want Nice Shit.

4201
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:39,350
You know,
you want your cameras,

4202
02:47:39,351 --> 02:47:40,760
you want the Internet,
you won't computers.

4203
02:47:40,761 --> 02:47:44,780
You want to read a producer with seven
buzzing devices next to him that comes

4204
02:47:44,781 --> 02:47:45,770
at a price,
right?

4205
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:48,110
There's an energy cost to that.
And if you want that,

4206
02:47:48,200 --> 02:47:50,420
you're going to have to get it from,
you're going to have to get the power

4207
02:47:50,421 --> 02:47:52,370
from somewhere and none of those
solutions are going to be,

4208
02:47:52,371 --> 02:47:57,260
things are going to like,
it's either drilling for it's Middle

4209
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:58,250
East oil.
Well,

4210
02:47:58,251 --> 02:47:59,270
sure.
I think we should invade.

4211
02:47:59,560 --> 02:48:01,820
As Ann Coulter said in the country's
killed their leaders,

4212
02:48:01,821 --> 02:48:03,860
convert them to Christianity,
which she also said,

4213
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:05,310
well,
she also said,

4214
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:07,650
who is he?
And coulters.

4215
02:48:07,720 --> 02:48:09,500
So did you say he also said,
no,

4216
02:48:09,501 --> 02:48:10,334
I didn't.
I said,

4217
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:12,410
I said,
she also said we should invade their

4218
02:48:12,411 --> 02:48:13,940
country's killed the leads and convert
them to Christianity.

4219
02:48:14,450 --> 02:48:18,530
He became a man.
What if she became a trainee and see the

4220
02:48:18,531 --> 02:48:19,660
ankle to whatever,
become a man.

4221
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:23,090
She's a beautiful woman.
How dare you lie to the Ma America,

4222
02:48:23,091 --> 02:48:26,270
the world?
I can't imagine you are a right wing

4223
02:48:26,271 --> 02:48:27,390
shill.
You Saddleback church.

4224
02:48:28,090 --> 02:48:32,870
We really are supportive of fracking.
You love circumcision.

4225
02:48:32,871 --> 02:48:34,990
I love ankles.
Um,

4226
02:48:36,020 --> 02:48:37,940
I think she's tremendous.
I know I do.

4227
02:48:37,941 --> 02:48:40,340
And do you know what I do?
She falls into the same bucket you do.

4228
02:48:40,341 --> 02:48:41,270
And I do.
And Trump does.

4229
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:43,070
She is.
No,

4230
02:48:43,071 --> 02:48:45,220
she's not troll.
You could characterize,

4231
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:48,920
you could characterize much of what both
of us do is just trolling.

4232
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:52,970
I don't trust them.
I don't tell me what I do with trolling.

4233
02:48:53,270 --> 02:48:54,830
Go ahead.
Viewers will make up their own judgments

4234
02:48:54,831 --> 02:48:56,570
on that one.
I'm not a tome fine.

4235
02:48:56,571 --> 02:48:57,231
Okay.
If you're not a trial,

4236
02:48:57,231 --> 02:48:59,270
that's fine.
I may say inflammatory things,

4237
02:48:59,271 --> 02:49:01,750
but I believe them.
I don't mean to meet you.

4238
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:04,490
So where do I go?
[inaudible] shit about Mexicans.

4239
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:09,830
I don't think she believes that I am.
I wanted to persuade you,

4240
02:49:09,831 --> 02:49:11,760
Kipp,
which is closest thing we have to

4241
02:49:11,761 --> 02:49:12,600
equipment,
the tea party.

4242
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:15,810
I want to persuade Ukip in the UK who
were banned from the pride march because

4243
02:49:15,811 --> 02:49:17,520
of course the leftists,
Houma,

4244
02:49:17,610 --> 02:49:21,390
homosexual establishment are nothing,
if not a ruthlessly intolerance of

4245
02:49:21,391 --> 02:49:22,830
conservatives.
It was much more difficult for me to

4246
02:49:22,831 --> 02:49:24,480
come out as a Tory that it wasn't a gay
person.

4247
02:49:24,970 --> 02:49:26,010
Um,
uh,

4248
02:49:26,011 --> 02:49:28,730
Tory being a conservative and much more
just got to come out of the

4249
02:49:28,731 --> 02:49:30,180
Conservatives.
Is that then it must have been gay.

4250
02:49:30,420 --> 02:49:31,470
Um,
right wing,

4251
02:49:31,471 --> 02:49:32,590
like I said,
write me.

4252
02:49:32,660 --> 02:49:35,080
It's very difficult.
Uh,

4253
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:36,120
I wanted Ukip,
who's,

4254
02:49:36,121 --> 02:49:38,520
I could look at the tea party to,
um,

4255
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:40,200
to,
uh,

4256
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:43,430
go all dressed in drag as Margaret
Thatcher and have signed,

4257
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:44,820
we'll have signs,
things like,

4258
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:46,320
um,
I've lost my thread.

4259
02:49:46,420 --> 02:49:49,540
Uh,
I lost my to say we've been talking for

4260
02:49:49,541 --> 02:49:50,340
a very long time.

4261
02:49:50,340 --> 02:49:51,600
Um,
what were you talking about?

4262
02:49:52,060 --> 02:49:53,730
Um,
gay people.

4263
02:49:54,870 --> 02:49:57,030
I've lost it.
Let's go to the UK and I've lost it.

4264
02:49:57,031 --> 02:49:58,260
It's gone.
It doesn't matter.

4265
02:49:58,410 --> 02:49:59,370
Trolling.
But now I've got,

4266
02:49:59,371 --> 02:50:00,210
I've got,
I've got a troll.

4267
02:50:00,211 --> 02:50:01,140
It's gone.
It's done.

4268
02:50:01,190 --> 02:50:06,190
You were accusing me of trolling,
it can be trollish as quarter.

4269
02:50:06,330 --> 02:50:07,500
Ken,
as Donald Trump is,

4270
02:50:07,770 --> 02:50:09,720
um,
where I think we can all be trollish and

4271
02:50:09,721 --> 02:50:13,770
it's it being provocative and outrageous
saying things you believe in.

4272
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:14,690
Um,
the,

4273
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:16,710
the definition of trolling is expanded
to cover that.

4274
02:50:16,711 --> 02:50:19,740
Now it's become essentially meaningless
word like racist.

4275
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:21,990
Well,
it's also dismissal word.

4276
02:50:21,991 --> 02:50:22,620
It's like,
you know,

4277
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:25,560
when someone calls you a sexist or
someone calls you a bigot,

4278
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:28,020
they'll call you.
And I think what we all do,

4279
02:50:28,050 --> 02:50:30,990
all four of us,
is we say thing,

4280
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:36,020
we gin up our jokes and our rhetoric and
our provocation to get attention and to

4281
02:50:37,261 --> 02:50:40,820
draw attention perhaps to people who are
unnecessarily offended by things that

4282
02:50:40,821 --> 02:50:42,540
they shouldn't be offended by two
idiots.

4283
02:50:42,810 --> 02:50:45,210
But in the course of doing so,
we do tell the truth what we really

4284
02:50:45,211 --> 02:50:46,200
believe in.
Now,

4285
02:50:46,230 --> 02:50:50,820
you may be the sort of least on that
spectrum that probably starts with you

4286
02:50:50,821 --> 02:50:53,310
and ends with Trump.
Your probably,

4287
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,320
you know,
the least trollish but you still do it.

4288
02:50:55,950 --> 02:50:57,180
Hmm.
Interesting.

4289
02:50:57,480 --> 02:50:59,660
Well,
I think it's part of the countercultural

4290
02:50:59,730 --> 02:51:00,331
spectrum.
You know,

4291
02:51:00,331 --> 02:51:01,170
if people,
if people,

4292
02:51:01,171 --> 02:51:02,530
you know,
you're not part of a right wing

4293
02:51:02,670 --> 02:51:04,590
establishment media,
you're your own thing.

4294
02:51:04,591 --> 02:51:05,221
You are,
you know,

4295
02:51:05,221 --> 02:51:06,130
you fall,
um,

4296
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:07,950
I think very squarely into that category
we talked about earlier.

4297
02:51:07,951 --> 02:51:08,850
You know,
that sort of,

4298
02:51:09,150 --> 02:51:11,790
I think many of the people who like each
of us,

4299
02:51:11,940 --> 02:51:12,661
uh,
have the same,

4300
02:51:12,661 --> 02:51:13,061
you know,
that we have,

4301
02:51:13,061 --> 02:51:14,280
we have a big overlap I think of,
of,

4302
02:51:14,281 --> 02:51:16,040
of,
of our listeners and fence.

4303
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:17,120
Yeah.
So I think we do too.

4304
02:51:17,170 --> 02:51:19,170
Yeah.
I'm trollish in some,

4305
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:23,580
here's one like what I said earlier
about tweeting about male feminists

4306
02:51:23,610 --> 02:51:25,170
choking to death on Vegan.
Peter.

4307
02:51:25,350 --> 02:51:28,710
That's clearly true but offensive.
It just strikes me,

4308
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:30,480
it strikes me as good government policy.

4309
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:34,770
Um,
we just did three hours,

4310
02:51:34,771 --> 02:51:35,551
man.
Shit.

4311
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:36,384
Really?
That was it.

4312
02:51:37,570 --> 02:51:41,880
And we could have done another three
easily when going to come to blows once

4313
02:51:41,881 --> 02:51:46,470
on the gay stuff.
That's what's fun.

4314
02:51:46,471 --> 02:51:49,770
It's fun when people die.
We got more heated about Christianity

4315
02:51:49,771 --> 02:51:50,820
than anything.
Yes we did.

4316
02:51:50,821 --> 02:51:54,870
Because you're a militant atheist.
Refused to extend that even an easy,

4317
02:51:54,871 --> 02:51:58,110
except the obvious truth that your your,
here's the thing,

4318
02:51:59,080 --> 02:52:01,140
this is where people can't get wrong.
Get me wrong.

4319
02:52:01,141 --> 02:52:02,780
I am not an economist.
I'm not,

4320
02:52:02,790 --> 02:52:04,020
I'm not,
I don't even,

4321
02:52:04,021 --> 02:52:05,030
I wouldn't even class.
And you know what,

4322
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:09,550
as anti I'm just,
I don't believe people,

4323
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:13,000
I think people are full of shit.
And when I read a story that's full of

4324
02:52:13,001 --> 02:52:14,080
Shit,
like look at,

4325
02:52:14,180 --> 02:52:16,270
first of all,
I know too much about the construction

4326
02:52:16,271 --> 02:52:18,190
of the Bible.
I know too much about the new testament.

4327
02:52:18,191 --> 02:52:22,330
I know Constantine and a bunch of
bishops constructed it and decided what

4328
02:52:22,331 --> 02:52:24,130
to leave out.
I know Constantine didn't even become a

4329
02:52:24,131 --> 02:52:26,320
Christian until right before he fucking
died.

4330
02:52:26,321 --> 02:52:28,660
Okay.
I know that the original Bible was

4331
02:52:28,661 --> 02:52:33,160
written in ancient Hebrew and to this
day there's a fucking shit ton of words

4332
02:52:33,161 --> 02:52:35,590
in ancient Hebrew that they have no idea
what the hell they mean.

4333
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:39,070
Not only that,
they an ancient Hebrew letters double as

4334
02:52:39,071 --> 02:52:40,270
numbers.
There were no numbers.

4335
02:52:40,271 --> 02:52:44,350
So the letter a was also the number one,
there's a numerical value to words and

4336
02:52:44,351 --> 02:52:48,850
sentences that was completely lost in
the translation to Latin and Greek and

4337
02:52:48,851 --> 02:52:49,750
eventually English.

4338
02:52:49,780 --> 02:52:51,670
I know that you're a well read and
passionate on the subject,

4339
02:52:51,671 --> 02:52:54,280
so let's move on.
We can't move on.

4340
02:52:55,610 --> 02:52:57,190
It's,
I'm not even,

4341
02:52:57,250 --> 02:52:59,860
I'm not anti God.
I've had so much flat a great,

4342
02:52:59,861 --> 02:53:03,370
it's been great.
Thank you for having me on man time ever

4343
02:53:03,371 --> 02:53:04,660
in town again.
Let's do it again.

4344
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:07,480
We could probably be,
you can be sure.

4345
02:53:07,481 --> 02:53:08,400
I'll be back.
Uh,

4346
02:53:08,401 --> 02:53:10,290
I think that's my next sentence then we
could do what?

4347
02:53:10,291 --> 02:53:12,020
I really like it guest,
we can do 180.

4348
02:53:13,270 --> 02:53:14,980
I've had a lovely time.
And when you come to London,

4349
02:53:15,010 --> 02:53:16,550
um,
make sure you let me know and I'll say

4350
02:53:17,230 --> 02:53:19,030
absolutely.
I'm usually in London like once a year.

4351
02:53:19,250 --> 02:53:20,680
Um,
how often do you mean house Angeles?

4352
02:53:21,310 --> 02:53:22,810
I think I'm going to be around a lot
more now.

4353
02:53:23,620 --> 02:53:27,490
Someone's got something cooking,
which I can't quite tell you that I have

4354
02:53:27,491 --> 02:53:29,200
a little,
I have a little announcement coming in

4355
02:53:29,201 --> 02:53:30,490
the next seven days,
which,

4356
02:53:30,510 --> 02:53:31,343
um,
uh,

4357
02:53:31,660 --> 02:53:33,890
will draw me to the u s much more often.
Well,

4358
02:53:33,891 --> 02:53:35,350
listen,
you're a lot of fun.

4359
02:53:35,351 --> 02:53:37,660
Your articles are fantastic.
I really enjoy it.

4360
02:53:37,661 --> 02:53:39,940
Your Twitter feeds great.
Check it out.

4361
02:53:39,941 --> 02:53:43,080
It's Nero,
the one that killed all the Christians

4362
02:53:43,081 --> 02:53:44,920
that is evil,
that evil.

4363
02:53:44,930 --> 02:53:47,950
Do that.
So regulations are getting that as a

4364
02:53:47,951 --> 02:53:50,080
Twitter handle.
That's an excellent friends in low

4365
02:53:50,081 --> 02:53:51,490
places.
Excellent catch.

4366
02:53:51,491 --> 02:53:53,020
All right.
That's it ladies and gentlemen.

4367
02:53:53,380 --> 02:53:56,060
We'll be back tomorrow until then.
Go Fuck Yourself.

4368
02:53:56,090 --> 02:53:57,580
So I ride up by,

4369
02:54:03,900 --> 02:54:04,020
yes.
