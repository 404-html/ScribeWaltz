1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:01,861
Okay.

3
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:02,790
Here's a serious question.

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,170
Is there a guy that has ever existed that
has a full suit of armor in his house

5
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,400
that isn't a douchebag?

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,613
Nope.

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,220
Well,

8
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,551
I mean,

9
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:13,920
comic book collector guys
aren't really Douche bags.

10
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,131
You know,

11
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:15,150
they like that shit.

12
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,630
You know,

13
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,463
like they have like,

14
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,110
they have like a real suit
of armor in their house.

15
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,330
I've almost bought it an
armored helmet the other day.

16
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,440
I saw helmets.

17
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,520
Helmets are kind of dope.

18
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:23,821
Yeah,

19
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:24,631
I almost bought one of those.

20
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,320
I could see it.

21
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,240
I would say last case I would say,

22
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,710
uh,

23
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,780
the same could be said about those dives.

24
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,020
Store a Indians.

25
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,160
Oh,

26
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,090
cigar store Indian

27
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,750
or the black jockeys that
you put on your lawn.

28
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,530
Oh fuck.

29
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,930
How about people who have like
little gremlins and shit on there?

30
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,960
The elves,

31
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,290
you know,

32
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,123
what do they call him?

33
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,160
My Step Mama has it.

34
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,530
He East on her front porch today.

35
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,400
If it starts to rain,

36
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,600
she puts a raincoat on it.

37
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,680
And then if it's like Halloween,

38
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,660
she dresses up in a low
cost and it's like this,

39
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,550
this big ceramic geese.

40
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,331
And then I,

41
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,020
I was,

42
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,010
I always make fun of it.

43
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,490
And then somebody came broke it
recently and she was so sad about it.

44
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
So now she has all these stupid geese
outfits and she can't find another one of

45
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,150
them.

46
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,983
So see,

47
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,273
are you kidding me?

48
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,203
No.

49
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,050
Some geese.

50
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,550
What happened today?

51
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:18,530
It was the worst day of my life.

52
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,230
Someone cracked my ceramic bed.

53
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,950
How you had that one than I leave.

54
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,900
It makes me so happy.

55
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:28,130
I come home.

56
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,860
I you see my ceramic duck.

57
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,260
I got him into Toronto
world fairy 62 it's acts.

58
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,420
They don't make 'em or that much anymore.

59
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,500
He's beauty foe.

60
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,000
He defined my God.

61
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,520
I swear you still look at me.

62
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,500
He was my friend.

63
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,360
I know that sounds retarded.

64
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,100
I don't care.

65
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,140
He was my friend

66
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,800
ever since he left.

67
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,270
Ever since Jimmy left,

68
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,380
he's gone.

69
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,160
Oh,

70
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
ever since he's gone.

71
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:01,950
A house is haunted.

72
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,410
Ever since he's gone.

73
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,730
I feel a little crazy.

74
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:09,390
I can't sleep at night cause I feel like
I failed him and he's going to kill me

75
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:10,224
in my sleep.

76
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,223
I should have,

77
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,630
I should have gotten him a coat of armor.

78
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,670
It was my little Charlie.

79
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:18,260
I had a name for forum,

80
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,210
Charlie the duck,

81
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,790
and now he's dead.

82
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,850
I had illustrated books I
made about him over the years.

83
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
He's going to come back and kill
those punks that broke them.

84
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,920
Those fucking punks.

85
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,500
Stephen King movie about a
fucking evil ceramic duck.

86
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,521
That's some good.

87
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:37,390
Some kids break.

88
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,850
It goes out and cuts their
throat and their sleep.

89
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,270
Yeah.

90
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,930
Just imagine that you're waking
up and a giant ceramic doc.

91
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,140
I just cutting your throat.

92
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:54,730
Yeah.
