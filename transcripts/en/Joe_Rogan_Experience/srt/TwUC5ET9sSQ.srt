1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,520
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,010
Do you watch those movies
and shake your head?

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,211
I like him.

4
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:07,680
I just knew I liked science fiction,

5
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:07,860
you know?

6
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,510
Right.

7
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,000
You know,

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,781
so yeah,

9
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:10,350
I didn't sit there.

10
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,610
I grew up with star wars.

11
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,660
That was my,

12
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,240
when I was nine years
old or some finances.

13
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,380
Yeah.

14
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,213
I'm not having this.

15
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,080
I did,

16
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,661
I did a,

17
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,680
an argument with Neil,

18
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,290
the grass tight,

19
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:20,821
not an argument,

20
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:24,270
but a debate with him about lightsabers
ones cause I claimed that they're

21
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,340
physically the in
principle there possible.

22
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,630
Um,

23
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,800
and he was trying to say that they aren't,

24
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,420
but they are what did have to loop back
around cause the light's not continuing

25
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,630
to like the fact that it goes to
a certain distance and pauses.

26
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,610
We don't have a mirror or something,

27
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:38,911
I guess.

28
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:39,091
Yeah.

29
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:40,470
Something that's true to be the end of it.

30
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:40,621
Right.

31
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,040
That's true.

32
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,590
So it wouldn't,

33
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,830
it'd be a different kind of light.

34
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,420
So the only point was
making is that photons,

35
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,270
particles of light can
bounce off each other.

36
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,530
So we see that in really high energy
experiments in particle accelerators.

37
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,630
We can collide photons together.

38
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,980
So my point was a bit of a
pedantic physicist one but he's,

39
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,491
cause he,

40
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,860
it is true that light can bounce off.

41
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,500
It can hit light but very,

42
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:05,334
very high energy.

43
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,300
But when they press that
button to a certain distance,

44
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,523
I wasn't,

45
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,453
that's engineering.

46
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,290
I agree with you.

47
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:13,921
I agree with you.

48
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:14,754
The distance thing,

49
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,100
I agree mass to it.

50
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:17,820
Right.

51
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,560
So as you're swinging it around,

52
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,340
you wouldn't have the
leverage of a long thing.

53
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,230
So why not make it really long?

54
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,630
Cause it wouldn't be
difficult to swing around.

55
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,050
Like you could stab someone
with a lightsaber a mile away.

56
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,943
That's true.

57
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,300
Well I shoot a laser in it.

58
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,800
Yes.

59
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,580
Like why,

60
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,690
why make it so short?

61
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,971
You have to swing,

62
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,920
you got to be close to
hitting a person with it.

63
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,910
That's a silly,

64
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,110
silly design.

65
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,830
You are picking holes
correctly in the engineering.

66
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:47,664
Part of my,

67
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,100
the only point I was
making is that physics is,

68
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:54,460
that we shutting is quite interesting
is it light can bounce off light.

69
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,221
So,

70
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,041
but it would have to do,

71
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,090
it would have to be something that
causes it to stop at the very end.

72
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,980
Yeah,

73
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,470
yeah,

74
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,303
yeah.

75
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,271
Which would be,

76
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:03,691
you're right,

77
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:04,290
you'd have a merit,

78
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,080
but he wouldn't look cool with it if
there was a no kind of thing within,

79
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,370
which drives me crazy about star
wars is not the light sabers.

80
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,670
It's the lasers when
they're shooting the guns.

81
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:14,250
So I'm like,

82
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,830
why can I see that when
I can't see bullets?

83
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,920
This is,

84
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
we're supposed to be way
faster than a bullet.

85
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,330
Yeah.

86
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,430
Like easy to see this
because it's like George,

87
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,323
you could duck,

88
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,170
you can get out of the way.

89
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,710
Those things,

90
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,543
they really slow.

91
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm so angry.

92
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,630
I feel like this is so dumb.

93
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:34,980
I could go warp speed in this Millennium
Falcon and travel the speed of light,

94
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,120
but for whatever reason,

95
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:39,030
these lasers are so slowly you
could duck out of the way of them.

96
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,780
That's so dumb.

97
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,790
And he's not only star wars is,

98
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,520
it's everything.

99
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,790
Uh,

100
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,860
the epigenome is quite difficult.

101
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,723
Different.

102
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,720
The epigenome is that the structure
of how the DNA is looped around.

103
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,770
If you look at the chromosome,

104
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:50,430
you're not seeing the gene Amil.

105
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:55,431
It really basically saying epigenome and
what w what I think is causing aging is

106
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:58,160
not that you're losing the DNA structure,

107
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,710
you're not having mutations.

108
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,410
You're actually changing the epigenome,

109
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,244
which is the,

110
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,230
the reader of the genes.

111
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,303
To put another way,

112
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,690
a compact disc,

113
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,763
okay.

114
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,010
Uh,

115
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,150
for the young audience,

116
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,420
uh,

117
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,821
come back.

118
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,760
Discs are little things
we used to put music on.

119
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,111
But anyway,

120
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,500
these are,

121
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,270
these are digital information of course.

122
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,390
And the reason we switched to digital
in the first place is that it's very

123
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,820
copyable and it doesn't wear out.

124
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,700
Whereas a,

125
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,560
a cassette tape,

126
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,221
you know,

127
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:27,550
people our age know that if you
try to copy that a thousand times,

128
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,660
there's not much left at the end.

129
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,280
So that the compact disc
inflammation is the genome.

130
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,160
The epigenome is the reader of the CD,

131
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,720
that little laser that goes around.

132
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,400
And what I think is causing aging is
not the loss of the digital information,

133
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,890
but it's the reader at the analog pot.

134
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,890
And that's like a cassette
tape that eventually runs out.

135
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,350
So what we,

136
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,770
what's going on really is that your
cells are losing the ability to read the

137
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,350
right genes the way they
did when you were 20.

138
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,710
And that's basically noise,

139
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,900
informational noise
that gathers over time.

140
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:02,770
Um,

141
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,120
and so what we end up with when we're
80 is a compact disc or DVD that

142
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:07,840
scratched.

143
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,670
So the reader cannot read the right genes,

144
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,780
the right time,

145
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,550
and the cells become dysfunctional.

146
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,170
Now what we're working on is how do you
Polish that CD or that DVD to get that

147
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,460
information back again?

148
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,241
And if you could do that,

149
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:23,320
I think that's really the
best way to reset your age.

150
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,520
And I,

151
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,390
we haven't published it yet,

152
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:25,691
but,

153
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,140
uh,

154
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,370
we're working on ways to
actually reset that genome,

155
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,220
actually get back the information
that we once had when we were 20.

156
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,550
So what is happening to the epigenome
when you're going through those scanners?

157
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,690
Well,

158
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,900
so what we found is the biggest
disruptor of the epigenome is,

159
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:41,340
uh,

160
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,900
a broken chromosome and DNA break.

161
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,970
And I don't know about scanners,

162
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,800
that's just an abundance of caution.

163
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,660
But an x ray will damage your DNA,

164
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,943
no question.

165
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,893
Um,

166
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,290
even going out in the sun,

167
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,130
we'll do a bit of that.

168
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,500
And we think that the cells reaction to
that break having to unwrap the DNA from

169
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,281
its Chromatin,

170
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,114
we call it,

171
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,841
and uh,

172
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:06,790
and then rewrap it is what eventually
disrupts the ability to read the right

173
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,511
gene at the right place.

174
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,420
So Dna damage is essentially
a s a little scratch on,

175
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,460
on the DVD.

176
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,990
And that accumulates over time.

177
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,550
A lot of people are not willing to learn
how to do that because they want the

178
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,420
fast track out,

179
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,280
take a drug and pass out.

180
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,091
That is the thing,

181
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:21,331
right?

182
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,260
They just want a pill.

183
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,860
Yeah.

184
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,680
It's very unfortunate that
those things exist in that,

185
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:28,260
that that sort of thinking is,

186
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,370
you know,

187
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,260
it's reinforced.

188
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,243
Yeah.

189
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah.

190
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,721
It's encouraged.

191
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:34,220
In fact,

192
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,800
you know,

193
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,210
all these ads and all these
doctors and different people,

194
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,720
well if you have a hard time sleeping,

195
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,120
I'll just write your prescription.

196
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:43,140
And then next thing you know,

197
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,090
and I mean you look at the animal world,

198
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:46,290
like they self medicate,

199
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,140
they'll use clay for
parasites and you know,

200
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,750
dogs leak grass for stomach issues.

201
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,860
And you know that I guess birds now are
putting like nicotine and cigarettes and

202
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:59,960
their nests cause there's some of
benefit to that and you see animals

203
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,070
self-medicating,

204
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,550
you see our ancestors using
everything from you know,

205
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,370
cannabis to Ceylon cinnamon to you know,

206
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,950
all sorts of different derivatives
for thousands of years.

207
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,300
So it's not like supplementation or self
medication or the or the whole creation

208
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:18,380
of pharmaceuticals is something that's
unnatural or not acceptable human

209
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,214
activity.

210
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,260
But once you start to use it as a crutch,

211
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,930
I think that's where you
run into issues like once,

212
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:28,931
once you deny the human body's ability
to be able to heal itself or to be able

213
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,070
to decrease stress on its own,

214
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,290
you begin to rely on
these exogenous chemicals.

215
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,030
I think that's where you
start playing with fire.

216
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,950
The idea that you're
going to be this balance,

217
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,290
chilled out person and
still be a fucking world.

218
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,120
Smasher good luck with that.

219
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,520
I'm the farthest thing
from relaxed and chill.

220
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,200
You know,

221
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
I try to learn now,

222
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,230
but,

223
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,020
but when you're training
and when you look,

224
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,230
there's a mindset that's
required to beat the best guys,

225
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,830
and it's not the same mindset
that's required to get good to get,

226
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,960
you could get good and be a chilled out,

227
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,710
relaxed person.

228
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,660
Like say you want to be
a black belt in Jujitsu,

229
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,920
that's totally possible.

230
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,180
You can be really good.

231
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,661
People can go,

232
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:02,871
Hey,

233
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:03,704
look at Mike Mann.

234
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,180
Mike has got great triangle.

235
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:05,751
Watch them raw.

236
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,051
Wow,

237
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:06,884
he's really good.

238
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,650
But if Mike wants to be the
motherfucker have motherfuckers,

239
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:10,600
you better be crazy.

240
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,030
You know,

241
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,470
you better be God damn crazy.

242
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,210
You better be like Mike
Tyson when he was young.

243
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:14,520
Yup.

244
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,220
Be those Michael Jordan's
you're talking about,

245
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,420
they're always thinking about it.

246
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,750
Roy Jones Jr yes.

247
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,581
All of those guys.

248
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,710
You gotta be a fucking crazy person.

249
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,573
Absolutely.

250
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,570
Roy Jones Jr played a professional
basketball game the day of his fight.

251
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,340
Played a guy in a basketball game,

252
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,230
did not have competitive.

253
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,730
Do any.

254
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,563
Just an athlete.

255
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,693
Yeah.

256
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,180
Yeah.

257
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,541
I mean,

258
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,790
I just don't think there's any other way.

259
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,271
I mean,

260
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,490
I think if you're going to win a race,

261
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:41,810
you're going to red line
the engine because I just
don't see how you're going to

262
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,730
beat the best guy.

263
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,810
Everybody is trying their best.

264
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,883
This is the thing.

265
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,780
There's so much going on there.

266
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,890
I mean you could have like a really
good coach so you have an advantage.

267
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,460
Technically you could have a really
good group of guys you train with,

268
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,460
so you have an advantage in
the environment that you're
training in and there's

269
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,450
a lot of inspiration.

270
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,270
But if you're not a fucking psychopath,

271
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,753
good luck.

272
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,600
I know my friend Sam Harris was trying
to get you guys to ban Donald Trump.

273
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,740
He was saying if the fall,

274
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:10,970
your terms of service,

275
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
I just did a podcast with
him actually as well.

276
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,210
It should come out today or tomorrow.

277
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,953
He's uh,

278
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,470
he's a,

279
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,110
he's a fascinating guy.

280
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:18,651
Sam Harris.

281
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:19,490
I love him to death.

282
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,070
But what he was trying
to do was like saying,

283
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,340
hey,

284
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,170
he's threatening nuclear war.

285
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,610
Like he's saying,

286
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,510
Hey Korea,

287
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,280
my bombs are bigger than your bombs.

288
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:28,611
Like,

289
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,670
what else does the guy
have to do to get your,

290
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,960
to remove them from the platform?

291
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,250
When you guys saw that,

292
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:34,391
what,

293
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,810
what was your reaction to that?

294
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,550
Was there an internal discussion about
actually banning the president of United

295
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,750
States?

296
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,021
Well,

297
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:41,854
so,

298
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,570
so two things there.

299
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,404
One,

300
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,830
it was a context that presidents of this
country have you similar language in

301
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,630
different mediums.

302
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,240
They use it on radio,

303
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,240
use it on television.

304
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,010
It's not just through Twitter.

305
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,670
And even if you were looking at,

306
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,790
you were to look at the
presidency of Obama.

307
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,350
It wasn't exactly the same tone
in this exact same language,

308
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:10,560
but there were threats
around the same country.

309
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,040
And we have to take that
context into consideration.

310
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,070
So the second thing is that we need the
most controversial aspect of our rules

311
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,310
and our terms of services.

312
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,340
Probably this clause around public
interest in newsworthiness where,

313
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,493
um,

314
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,970
powerful figures are public figures,

315
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:33,660
might,

316
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:33,980
uh,

317
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,330
be in violation of our terms of service.

318
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:41,310
But the tweet itself
is of public interest.

319
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,850
Yes,

320
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,190
there should be a conversation around it.

321
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,820
And that is probably the thing
that people disagree with the most.

322
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,121
Um,

323
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:53,910
and where we have a
lot of internal debate,

324
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,340
but we also have some pretty hard lines.

325
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,690
If we had a global leader,

326
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,430
including the president of United States,

327
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,460
make a violent threat
against a private individual,

328
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,870
we would take action.

329
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,690
We,

330
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,500
we always have to balance that with like,

331
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,220
is this a,

332
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,030
is this something that the
public has interest in it?

333
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,721
And I,

334
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,790
I believe generally the answer is yes.

335
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,900
It's not going to be in every case,

336
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,070
but generally the answer is yes,

337
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:22,071
because we should see how our
leaders think and how they act.

338
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:30,990
Okay.
