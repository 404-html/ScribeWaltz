1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,260
18 year old and shit like that.

2
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:01,560
Right.

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,070
His daughter.

4
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,431
Here we go.

5
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:02,761
Here we go.

6
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,030
Yeah,

7
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,280
yeah,

8
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,113
yeah.

9
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:04,980
Three,

10
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,813
two,

11
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,713
one.

12
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,371
Damn.

13
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,530
It's been a minute since we
did one of these hot minute.

14
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,453
How long has it been?

15
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,210
I can't remember his months.

16
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,333
Longer than that.

17
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,260
The cows just not part of the fight.

18
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:16,480
This,

19
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,380
the fight companion.

20
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,550
These,

21
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,001
wow.

22
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,050
You're kicking them out.

23
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:20,420
I can't believe I knew
it was going to happen.

24
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:20,700
Dude.

25
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,690
Why are we going to do,

26
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:22,530
we got to fall in,

27
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,020
kind of get to put them out to see,

28
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:25,291
man,

29
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:25,381
he's,

30
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:25,921
he had an old,

31
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,210
he just can't make it a sentence.

32
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,130
She had the Beatles that they kicked out.

33
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,820
Jamie says name.

34
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,180
We're radio came in the original drummer.

35
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:36,961
He was a drummer.

36
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:37,200
Right.

37
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,310
Well Fuck Peter.

38
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,240
If you bring in rain,

39
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:40,020
go.

40
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,501
He was,

41
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,310
uh,

42
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,880
it was,

43
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,870
it was so sad.

44
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,011
Pete.

45
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,420
Best.

46
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:44,820
Yeah.

47
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,450
I was listening to this
Malcolm Gladwell book on tape.

48
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:51,960
It's called outliers and they got
into a part about the Beatles,

49
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,101
the Beatles,

50
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,730
man,

51
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,260
when this Pete Pete passed,

52
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,060
he was there in the beginning.

53
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,571
Man,

54
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:57,941
he,

55
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,460
he did these crazy gigs with them.

56
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,410
Could you imagine like you being a part
of a band and then you get kicked out of

57
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:04,861
that band?

58
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,030
It turns into the Beatles.

59
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,180
That's never happened before.

60
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,751
I mean,

61
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,710
no one is ever those before.

62
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,450
Right,

63
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,830
so no one has ever been.

64
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,740
Is that him right there.

65
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,030
Oh,

66
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,350
he doesn't look like he fits in,

67
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,184
does he?

68
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,740
How bout when has it ever been that guy?

69
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,950
I bet he went home was like,

70
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,280
but they screaming when they first,

71
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,114
Oh my God.

72
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,490
There was nothing like that before that.

73
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,021
That's a piece.

74
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:27,200
People,

75
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,650
people say that that was all staged.

76
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,161
No,

77
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,140
come on ad screaming.

78
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,740
No saying that

79
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,090
beavers are faking to,

80
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,440
I'll send you a link.

81
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,990
The Biebs has the same effect on some men.

82
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,900
Girls lose nobody.

83
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,773
Mine.

84
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,801
Certain dudes,

85
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,030
Brendan Jabber like that.

86
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,490
Never like if you look at that old,

87
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,360
those go crazy.

88
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,194
That footage,

89
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,811
those chicks,

90
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,141
dude,

91
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,880
that's he as they didn't
have the internet,

92
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,100
they didn't know there'd be endorsed.

93
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,010
That was natural.

94
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,020
That's how every girl naturally feels.

95
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,340
There's no Instagram,

96
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,391
no Instagram.

97
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:00,991
There's nothing.

98
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:03,660
So first time you see
them in person we have,

99
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,820
is there a possibility that it was set up?

100
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,270
Is there a possible put
the conspiracy we have,

101
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,951
we have a,

102
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,340
an idea of what women are based on,

103
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:15,240
how women behave around us when they're
worried about the way we think about

104
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:15,720
them.

105
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,500
The same way we behave
differently when it's all us,

106
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
when there's no women around,

107
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,830
there's just ways that people behave.

108
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,320
And if you leave all these women together,

109
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,161
hold on a second,

110
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:26,430
right?

111
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,910
If you leave all of these women
together and it's 19 what,

112
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,893
what year was that?

113
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,200
Said?

114
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,551
What's that?

115
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,690
The sixties late sixties right?

116
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:36,524
Ones

117
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:37,610
do,

118
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,020
they didn't even barely
have books back then.

119
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,410
I mean there was the kitchen,

120
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,620
he a Beatles girl screaming.

121
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,401
Of course they had books.

122
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,180
I'm joking,

123
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,730
but what I'm not joking around about
it is that they had no one had ever

124
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:51,970
experienced anything like that before.

125
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,860
And if you get all these girls together
and they're seeing these guys who

126
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:59,830
they're seeing on television and they're
seeing on the Ed Sullivan and there's,

127
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,440
they're seeing him everywhere and they're
sitting there in the newspapers and

128
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:07,441
the magazines and they see these guys
and the sounds they make are so good in

129
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:13,300
the way they sing and play music
together is so magical and it's so

130
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,560
unprecedented and it's a new kind
of sound and they just special,

131
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:17,980
you know,

132
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,270
these girls just can't help it.

133
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,103
Like me,

134
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,490
Brian,

135
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,960
you know when you're a pig,

136
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,880
you ever see a taping of a TV show?

137
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,860
Did you ever see the big
applause light with our plots?

138
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,500
And they make,

139
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,360
is that a real plaza?

140
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:31,360
Is that a fake applause?

141
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,350
I mean that's fake.

142
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,270
Their conditional.

143
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,470
Well that's a different level level to

144
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,630
listen those uplights
they're not a conspiracy.

145
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,740
They're not a conspiracy,

146
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,280
but they are kind of cheesy dude,

147
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,270
look at Justin Bieber's concert.

148
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:49,991
I mean listen,

149
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,400
I worked at hot as fuck.

150
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,940
He is hot,

151
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,481
but I worked.

152
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,310
So I worked in security for it,

153
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,520
like some of these uh,

154
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,990
bands and I worked for the hip
when Hilary Duff was in her a day,

155
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,980
I'm talking bitches passing
out from excitement at the,

156
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,840
grabbed their big asses out of the crowd.

157
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,160
That's not fake.

158
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:06,994
That's real dude.

159
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,440
It's fucking bitches crying.

160
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:11,310
I have to understand that girls have
a completely different reaction.

161
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,281
Not all girls,

162
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:12,851
but some,

163
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:13,900
some dude's too,

164
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,820
or you brought up.

165
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,180
Do you remember the reactions?

166
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,750
There's a,

167
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,850
there's a lot of Beatles
footage of the audience,

168
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,180
but there's girls just
fucking flipping out,

169
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:23,640
screaming and crying,

170
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,000
like just going nuts.

171
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,440
You remember those toe shots?

172
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,500
100% look,

173
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,510
do,

174
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,400
do I think that girls would act up to
get on camera to make it a bigger deal?

175
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,323
Yes.

176
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,340
Do I think that's what
they were all doing?

177
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,160
No.

178
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,560
Look at this mayhem dude.

179
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:42,120
I think they couldn't believe that the
Beatles were actually there and there'd

180
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,220
never been anybody like the
Beatles before hock thirsty bro.

181
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,530
I think they were just hypnotized.

182
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,560
There's something singing out in their
DNA about that music because look,

183
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,390
we can listen to the Beales
today and it's still great.

184
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,550
I listened to the white
album just the other day.

185
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,373
It was amazing.

186
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,190
How was it?

187
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,610
That's a different beginning
to where sexy though.

188
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,100
They weren't like heart drops their
dick had here because don't have to take

189
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,830
basic did don't know.

190
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,741
It's the music.

191
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,520
It's the music.

192
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,600
They're so good.

193
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,110
And this,

194
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,670
this movie or this book rather.

195
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,210
The Malcolm Gladwell was
all about extraordinary
performances like what people

196
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,380
have done that's been
completely extraordinary.

197
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,130
And one of them was talking about how
the Beatles got so good because they

198
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:24,964
played,

199
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,630
I think it was Berlin was where
they play or Homburg one of those.

200
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,890
So they played somewhere
where they played all night.

201
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,790
They played like multiple hours a
night and they played every day.

202
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,720
They played an insane number of shunt
of audience in front of audiences.

203
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,760
They just played constantly and he
talked about the importance of that,

204
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,550
that by the time we got to see them,

205
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,260
by the time they were on television,

206
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,470
they had played together so many more
times than the average band where we'll do

207
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:57,370
in their entire career.

208
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,010
Like the

209
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,791
sheer numbers.

210
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,200
They were always playing,

211
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,270
always doing these live performances.

212
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,410
I forget where it was,

213
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,120
but the cavern club where,

214
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:05,721
where was it?

215
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,520
Beatles at the cavern club
is what it was called,

216
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,180
I think.

217
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,300
Where is the place that they
performed early in their career?

218
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,680
I want to say it's a Homburg.

219
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,280
This says the first of a long series
of resident nights during a traditional

220
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,001
jazz evening,

221
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,540
they performed an interval as the only
rock group during an all night session

222
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,440
including jazz.

223
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,740
Maybe it might be one of
many things they've done.

224
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,870
I would not think this
was before they made it.

225
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,440
This was like as they were
like young guys coming up,

226
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,460
just think about the
Beatles in Hamburg corner.

227
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,190
Just so many repetitions.

228
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,641
Yeah,

229
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,690
and he talked about how it,

230
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,990
and then think about that
Pete best dude go fuck.

231
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,040
I was in the mix.

232
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,560
What would it do?

233
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,030
What did he end up donating thing?

234
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,030
He start his own band.

235
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,290
How do you recover from that biggest l?

236
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,351
Here's the thing,

237
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,790
there's never been a Beatles before,

238
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,820
so we're looking at the
Beatles like we already know.

239
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,654
They're awesome.

240
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,390
They're all already a part
of pop culture history.

241
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,051
I miss them.

242
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,660
I'm younger.

243
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:57,870
Yeah,

244
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,630
but if we live back then,

245
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:00,200
man,

246
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,260
if it was like 1963 in the
Beatles burst in the scene,

247
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,280
you would be like,

248
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,300
why is there anything close to that now?

249
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,120
There were two.

250
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,020
We have too much stimulus.

251
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:09,980
We see it too much.

252
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,180
Instagram.

253
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,260
We get inside their lives.

254
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,890
It's hard.

255
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,570
It's hard to find some huge bank.

256
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,520
There's that Korean ban that's fucking,

257
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,820
Ooh,

258
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,500
a Korean bands freak out of
k pop and I forget the name,

259
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,483
but they're starting to,

260
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,650
uh,

261
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,483
you'll see the,

262
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,830
the put them in like at the
grammys and stuff and the,

263
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,530
the entire crowd is these young teenage
Korean girls going fucking ape shit

264
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:31,070
flow.

265
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,903
They're huge.

266
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,580
But there's like the
backstreet boys and new kids.

267
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,570
What about the metal?

268
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,404
Have you heard of them?

269
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,220
What?

270
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,053
Baby metal?

271
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,870
No,

272
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,040
you haven't heard a baby metal?

273
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,640
Never Bro.

274
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,260
You've heard of baby metal does Amy's on
the ball with the always spirit to the

275
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,071
baby.

276
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:48,980
Metal is super technical power metal,

277
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,290
but they have little
Japanese girl singing.

278
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,220
It's gigantic.

279
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,580
It's like God gigantic he or patient.

280
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:58,881
No,

281
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,830
it's just funny you can't
put this on youtube right?

282
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:01,664
We'll Yank.

283
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,920
Damn.

284
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,300
It's super hardcore metal.

285
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,141
This is like,

286
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,040
it's like a

287
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,413
Gotcha.

288
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,250
We talked about repetitions.

289
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:14,880
They do.

290
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,200
You know in Korea there you can watch a
documentary on the k pop stuff and they,

291
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,281
they don't like,

292
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:21,780
it's not chemistry where the GIM together,

293
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,730
they forced them together and then they,

294
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,100
it's,

295
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,380
you're talking 14 hours a day.

296
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,370
They make them rehearse,

297
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,941
practice,

298
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:27,870
practice kept.

299
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,220
They can't have girlfriends,

300
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,020
boyfriends to tell him when to eat,

301
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,801
where to sleep.

302
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:34,860
It's a bs fog to that noise.

303
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,691
That's why I said I'd like the,

304
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:36,361
one of the biggest,

305
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:36,540
uh,

306
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,670
Korean pop singers often commit suicide.

307
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,121
Just couldn't,

308
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,200
didn't want to deal with the,

309
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,990
with the restrictions and the control
and sounds like Illuminati cheesy Christ.

310
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:45,670
Well,

311
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,500
so they're like,

312
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:46,620
oh,

313
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,870
the old school studio model.

314
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,340
Yeah.

315
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,170
You don't remember that.

316
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,003
You ever hear that?

317
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,040
No.

318
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,320
No.

319
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,153
With um,

320
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,821
they didn't,

321
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:56,280
they used to do that with
these two that with bands,

322
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,780
they do that with a,

323
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,740
even with movies,

324
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,990
it's signed in the old school studio days.

325
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,280
It's signed on to these long term
contracts and they would produce all this

326
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:08,540
stuff for them and forced them to
do things and studios would sign the

327
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,280
contracts.

328
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,560
Right.

329
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,380
Are they still do that?

330
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,220
That's them by the way.

331
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:14,760
Jamie bts bts behind the scenes.

332
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,680
That was things were,

333
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,940
it was crazy.

334
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,170
We haven't said anything about the files.

335
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,030
I don't know.

336
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,080
I don't know anything about
what young kids are doing today.

337
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,711
Every,

338
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:29,190
I have to go to Jamie and Jamie's in
intermediary because he's a grown man.

339
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,001
He's not,

340
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:30,834
he's not a bulldozer.

341
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,850
Bluebells 20 or 35 I have to try to
pay attention or the say I tried to,

342
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,480
man,

343
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,290
he's Jamie struggling to pay
attention that the young girls,

344
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:40,620
you know,

345
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,790
other mall multilayered my son,

346
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,880
young girls with the cutoff Jean shorts
in the ass cheeks hanging out the back.

347
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:45,660
That's,

348
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,280
I know that's in his crazy
ass out the back of the back.

349
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,930
People just trying so hard

350
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,720
just to get recognition,

351
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:55,070
man.

352
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,903
Ah,

353
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,770
it's a fascinating time to be a person.

354
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,070
It really is so interesting right now.

355
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,963
It's a good time.

356
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,871
Oh yeah.

357
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:04,920
It's a great time.

358
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,450
Also a rough time.

359
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,681
Wow.

360
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,570
It's all the mass shooters and that stuff.

361
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,050
That's funny.

362
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,740
Top part,

363
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,840
especially in charge or thousand oaks.

364
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,910
How was a safe ass place?

365
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,331
Yeah.

366
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,890
How does that number ring?

367
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,510
A former marine who was in the Las Vegas
shooting as a survivor was the survivor

368
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,450
and the thousand oaks shooting the fucking

369
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,650
insane.

370
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,270
Think about the odds of that.

371
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,260
That's why I was told when I grow,

372
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,790
think about,

373
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,490
well I think there,

374
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:29,851
there was,

375
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,200
so who was in the Vegas shooting?

376
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:31,921
Who survived that?

377
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,060
Who's at this one that died,

378
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,870
right.

379
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,410
It was that,

380
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,280
I think so.

381
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,391
Either way.

382
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,224
It's dark shit.

383
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,310
They don't have no idea
what his motive or anything.

384
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:41,730
Right.

385
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,301
The cops,

386
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,530
it investigated them.

387
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,750
They investigated them,

388
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,290
um,

389
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,610
fairly recently because they thought
he was unstable or something like that.

390
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,710
I think his mom called the cops,

391
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:53,130
like some,

392
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,100
somebody called the cops
and they investigated him,

393
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:56,791
talked to him.

394
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,950
And that's always tough if you're f
guys like what do you want us to do?

395
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,660
Arrest them for being fucking weird.

396
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:05,220
Like he didn't exactly like what can
we do for every one that does this cat

397
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:05,561
trail,

398
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:08,070
the guy thousand that don't,

399
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,001
you know,

400
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,900
I mean you've got to figure out what the
fuck is it that allows people to decide

401
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,010
to hit that switch.

402
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,220
Like I don't know if they understand that,

403
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,083
like the what is,

404
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,130
what's the psychological
motivation of that?

405
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:24,420
But it's gotta be a sign that there's
something wrong with our culture.

406
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,310
If it's kept popping up so often and
he's gotta be a sign that something,

407
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
there's something wrong.

408
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,730
Obviously they always chalk it up
to mental health and all right.

409
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:32,911
Yeah,

410
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:33,870
he was 100 percenters.

411
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,510
You know how many people
have mental health issues
and none of them are going to

412
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,940
blow people up or two people,

413
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,840
different kinds of mental health issues.

414
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,670
But then there's also just bad people.

415
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,300
Yeah.

416
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,950
Sometimes you got to
chalk it up to that too.

417
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,880
That's true too,

418
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,830
but you know a lot of bad people,

419
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,180
like a giant number.

420
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,770
I've had horrible things happen.

421
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:50,604
Yeah.

422
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,040
That's where it gets
weird because it's like,

423
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,261
okay,

424
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:53,980
what made

425
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,350
this guy become who he is and it's,

426
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,720
you definitely should.

427
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,830
You definitely should arrest
someone who does evil shit.

428
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,550
Right?

429
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,180
But what makes a person get to a
point where they can do evil shit?

430
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:09,910
This is a whole series of
events probably take place,

431
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,500
including abuse,

432
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,000
physical abuse,

433
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,080
maybe sexual abuse.

434
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,951
Sometimes there's not.

435
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,330
Sometimes you just get a bad apple.

436
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:17,320
Like with Jeffrey Dahmer,

437
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,480
it was like his pants liked it.

438
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:18,970
Yeah.

439
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,640
I mean you definitely need to get
into some weird shit with his mom,

440
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,270
but still,

441
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,710
you know how some people are born,

442
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,880
they have problems with their liver?

443
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,750
Yeah.

444
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,471
Some people are born,

445
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,460
they have problems with their brain.

446
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,600
That's just a fact.

447
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,850
We know that there's
problems with the eyesight.

448
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,170
This problems with,

449
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,850
you know,

450
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,790
people are born deaf.

451
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,330
Yup.

452
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,550
There's errors in the human body.

453
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:41,050
Sometimes you don't think that someone
can be born to just completely squirrely,

454
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,100
wired wrong.

455
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,940
Of course they can.

456
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,440
Sociopathy makes sense.

457
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,221
I'm not a doctor,

458
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,480
obviously a fucking moron,

459
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,960
but I bet a doctor would agree that
when you're dealing with mental health

460
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:56,140
issues you probably dealing with
this giant spectrum of them.

461
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,050
What if there's something we could check
so that like when they're a baby could

462
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:02,560
check and aside DNA called eugenics but
in there like this he's going to be a

463
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:03,161
bad kid.

464
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,770
Do we just do it?

465
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,840
But how you always going
to be about and why,

466
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,000
how many people on the
cemetery of your face,

467
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,641
how could,

468
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:14,770
how many people want to be a better
person and they don't ever get it together

469
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,110
and how many people are lacking like
some sort of coaching or lacking some

470
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,010
inspiration,

471
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,851
inspiration,

472
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:25,030
positive people in their life and then
their life spirals further and further

473
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,953
downhill.

474
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,460
How many people are on the border?

475
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,130
God,

476
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,871
the majority,

477
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:29,350
right?

478
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,651
Yes.

479
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:34,480
Cause I think people change and I think
people improve as they grow older and as

480
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,520
they become wiser and they
have more experiences.

481
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,241
But also if you,

482
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,290
if you look at the mass shooters,

483
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,050
a lot of them are quote unquote losers.

484
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,950
They live in their,

485
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,350
the parents' basement
and everything going on.

486
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,790
A lot of them were white
look like shit use mode.

487
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,050
They're always white and they,

488
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,240
oh,

489
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,073
he's white,

490
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,990
low energy,

491
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,640
always white and low energy,

492
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,381
low energy.

493
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,760
This guy didn't seem low energy.

494
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,181
You know,

495
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,130
the Nazis made propaganda films.

496
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,940
Uh,

497
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,691
basically,

498
00:13:58,691 --> 00:13:59,524
um,

499
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,310
uh,

500
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,290
they made people believe that a mentally
deranged people were out on the streets

501
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,550
attacking and killing people and they
may propaganda film so that they would

502
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,580
okay killing someone who was,

503
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,520
you know,

504
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,740
mentally deranged.

505
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,000
You always have to be careful of people
trying to label someone as someone that

506
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,250
you don't have to consider
it a regular human.

507
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,020
Someone who you could disregard.

508
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,130
That's what they do with the juice.

509
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:24,311
Right.

510
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,110
That's like the rats are stealing from us.

511
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:26,861
They're monsters.

512
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:27,640
That's what they do.

513
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,770
People done that throughout
history to other people.

514
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,660
There's like a scientific term for it.

515
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:32,710
I don't remember what it is,

516
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,820
but genics damn,

517
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:34,471
I was telling no,

518
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:35,304
that's not what I'm saying.

519
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,030
That's a scientific term for people
that demonize other groups of people and

520
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:40,151
their,

521
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:41,840
the way they look at propagandists.

522
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,460
No,

523
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,180
no.

524
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,290
The way you look at people like this is
a person and you looked at the enemy,

525
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,780
you would look at them like a subhuman.

526
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,400
There's,

527
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,550
it's like there's a psychological,

528
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,020
it is definitely racist.

529
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:54,360
Yeah.

530
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,380
But there's like a trait that people like.

531
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,530
There's like a pattern that
people commonly fall into
with that humanize them.

532
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,470
The enemy.

533
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,390
We're all stupid in it.

534
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,190
We are all stupid,

535
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,860
but dehumanizing the enemy.

536
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,870
It's a natural thing that people do.

537
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,580
It just fucking everyone does it.

538
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,170
It's so weird.

539
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,440
And it's how people can do gang warfare
is how people can do tribal warfare.

540
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:20,450
It's how people can do inter
continental w where you had your boy,

541
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,220
what's the name of the English cat?

542
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,480
The hypnotizer.

543
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,070
Daymond Aaron Brown hair and Brown.

544
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,380
Yeah.

545
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,080
Have you seen his thing on Netflix?

546
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,500
No.

547
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,240
It's fucking sick.

548
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,540
And so I'm not,

549
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,850
no spoiler,

550
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:33,080
but so he,

551
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,891
he took a guy,

552
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,360
like he took a ton of people,

553
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,290
took a guy who lives in Florida who's in
construction and who was super kind of

554
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:44,060
racist towards immigrants like
Mexicans and Hispanics and uh,

555
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,200
he sat him down.

556
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,590
He's got,

557
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,670
he's the perfect one for sure.

558
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,630
Cause your phone off Bro.

559
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,170
Damn it.

560
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,730
What in the fuck God damn Bro.

561
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,610
Hold on,

562
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,443
hold on.

563
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,911
Hey G.

564
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:55,081
Oh,

565
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,480
I'm on a bike companion
right now with Joe Rogan.

566
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:57,831
Say Hey.

567
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,040
Hey.

568
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,873
Hey.

569
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,291
Okay.

570
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,124
Sorry about that.

571
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,450
Did you hear about it or what?

572
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,150
Yeah,

573
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,261
yeah,

574
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,760
I was watching it as a,

575
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,301
um,

576
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,190
I watched your fight with Rosenthal.

577
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,313
Um,

578
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,491
oh,

579
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:09,324
I of them.

580
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,980
Yup.

581
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,370
Yup.

582
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,150
Points dude.

583
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,170
That's the point system.

584
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,771
You know what I mean?

585
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,630
That's the way they go down.

586
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,690
They call me

587
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,180
and then they took it away from him.

588
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,713
Match.

589
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,200
Yeah.

590
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,480
Yeah.

591
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,920
Wow.

592
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
Well I was smashing where I
had the under hook on him.

593
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,303
You know what I mean?

594
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,020
Yeah,

595
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,853
yeah.

596
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,490
Hello?

597
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,323
I'm on call.

598
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,610
I come back out to quarter guard and then,

599
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,860
and then they call me
for calling him like,

600
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,370
like,

601
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,280
like I don't get that when we
pass on our knees all the time.

602
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,200
Like you know what I mean?

603
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,020
Yeah.

604
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,841
So that's what it was.

605
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:42,500
They called you,

606
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,590
they called stalling for
you being in top half.

607
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,120
Yeah.

608
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,110
Is that why you lost?

609
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,101
Oh,

610
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:52,400
I thought I thought it was the judge's
decision and they gave it to him based on

611
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,653
that.

612
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,410
Okay.

613
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,200
This is super technical.

614
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,820
The only thing I mentioned I
talk about to the call you guys,

615
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,933
it's tough.

616
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,330
All right.

617
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,280
I don't think Jiu Jitsu is
boring but I don't either.

618
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,510
But if you could explain it.

619
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,540
No fucking idea what John Martinez in the
house monster Joe is a fantastic tool.

620
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,880
I tell dude under Eddie Bravo and he's
one we referenced many times in the

621
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:15,630
podcast,

622
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,370
him and his brother Richie boogeyman
because both those guys started out as

623
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,300
bboys.

624
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,800
They started out as these Israeli last
break dancers and they have incredible

625
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:26,970
control of their body.

626
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,590
And I remember when they first
started training at Eddie's plays.

627
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,391
Eddie was like,

628
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:30,750
like,

629
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,950
like he had a new form yet.

630
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:32,281
He's like,

631
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:32,880
dude,

632
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,060
fuck you break everyone.

633
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,043
Practice

634
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,143
practicing.

635
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,740
And he wrestled.

636
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:41,550
So he's got both.

637
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,500
But what's up with what's
going on with Tony?

638
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,620
I feel bad for him.

639
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,590
I feel like they're leaving
him in the fucking done.

640
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:46,831
No,

641
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:46,980
no,

642
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,300
no,

643
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,520
no,

644
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,641
no,

645
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:47,960
no,

646
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,120
no,

647
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,301
no,

648
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:48,540
no,

649
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:48,781
no.

650
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:49,501
They're leaving him.

651
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:49,920
No,

652
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,100
no,

653
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,820
no,

654
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,510
no.

655
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,260
Hey No,

656
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,750
they,

657
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,720
they're very serious about
doing something with Tony.

658
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,320
First we'll talk about,

659
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,960
Dana even said that he is most likely
next to next in line for Khabib.

660
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,640
Tony Ferguson.

661
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,200
Look after you to perform that man.

662
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,070
Fuck yeah,

663
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:05,521
he does.

664
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,200
And after that performance against Pedis,

665
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,730
like come on man.

666
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,481
This is,

667
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,350
this is the time.

668
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:11,670
It's the time to set him right.

669
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,200
He's so fucking tough.

670
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,190
He wants it too though.

671
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,260
I think could be said him or GSP,

672
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,094
right man.

673
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,540
Tony hasn't lost in,

674
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,321
what is it?

675
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,460
12 fights now?

676
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,050
How many fights is it?

677
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,840
1111 straight.

678
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,121
Well,

679
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:28,170
fight win streak against
guys like Edson Barboza,

680
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,440
Darcy's,

681
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,120
Kevin Lee,

682
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,910
Kevin Leach triangles,

683
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,660
him pedis.

684
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,770
Pedis gets an injury,

685
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,030
but because Thompson,

686
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,990
Josh Thompson

687
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,470
on hose up,

688
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,780
Lando Bernados,

689
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,160
Lando fuck beat tough fucking guys,

690
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:44,580
man.

691
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,050
Lando came at him.

692
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,520
He had no training camp for that one.

693
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,750
She was training for that one.

694
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,630
Well land they make though.

695
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,040
Lando is a talented guy,

696
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:53,430
man.

697
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,150
He pushed him.

698
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,860
I mean he clipped him and
he clipped him with that.

699
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,320
He does this a head kick out of the break.

700
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,000
Um,

701
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,440
but he survived that in one.

702
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:01,800
I mean,

703
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,610
dude,

704
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,440
Tony Ferguson is a fucking beast.

705
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,240
Look at those three Ho steel.

706
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,380
Those are no pumps,

707
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:07,770
man.

708
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,700
Josh Thomson,

709
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:13,701
Monster Barboza Ranada just to
look us and Joe's bows of an Datta.

710
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:18,991
Hofeld dos Anjos and Kevin Lee and then
Anthony Pettis in a row we can pass.

711
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,940
Those guys does not nearly get
nearly get the attention he deserves.

712
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:24,601
God Man,

713
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,770
he's got a million
followers now and he's more,

714
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,810
he should,

715
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,320
he should.

716
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,220
He should be.

717
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,121
First of all,

718
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:35,121
I don't think he should have been stripped
because he got injured one time doing

719
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:38,190
USC prep and doing something
and he tripped over some wires.

720
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,600
It's a freak accident.

721
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,610
It just something that happened,

722
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,211
you know,

723
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,740
to strip them because of that.

724
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:43,980
Like,

725
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,640
I don't know.

726
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,421
I think he'd be,

727
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:48,120
Anthony Pettis has 60% we know already,

728
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:48,360
but,

729
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,570
uh,

730
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,180
he,

731
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,013
he,

732
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,380
he's looked better before
the injury obviously,

733
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:56,120
but him coming back that fast doing what
he did is it's like even adopt cruise.

734
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,311
Like,

735
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,080
I don't know how the fuck he's doing this.

736
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,750
So I thought even as good as he looked,

737
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,770
that's not even him at his,

738
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:02,701
you know,

739
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,050
he's gonna be even better
than this next fight.

740
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,351
Well,

741
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,510
I think more pet has look really good too.

742
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,360
You got to give credit to Pedis for sure.

743
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,040
Clip Titus,

744
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,380
collect him and he had him hurt,

745
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,360
but Tony figured out a way
to hold on and survive.

746
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:15,450
But he didn't look like he
was missing a beat to me.

747
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,351
He looked,

748
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,060
he looked very in tune.

749
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,720
Did I?

750
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,820
I heard something that
he didn't spar for this.

751
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,654
Is that true?

752
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,413
Um,

753
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,730
I'm not too sure what he
does with the striking.

754
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,830
I'm never there when he
transferred the striking.

755
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,420
I have no idea to tell you the truth.

756
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,201
You don't stay all can't.

757
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:34,890
We just deal with the ground
now when we do no shit told me.

758
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:36,480
And I've heard that too when he spars,

759
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,440
when we do Jujitsu we uh,

760
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,720
we definitely spark situation situation.

761
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,310
No like straight up striking.

762
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,810
No 16 ounce gloves.

763
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,710
Man Data is such a debate.

764
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,210
What a crazy debate that is.

765
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,383
Does the same thing,

766
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,700
does he know sparring?

767
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,850
Here's his starting six years might not,

768
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,530
that might not be a bad idea.

769
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,570
Robbie Lawler took six
years off sparring too.

770
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,351
He did.

771
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:03,350
But then he became better when he went
to [inaudible] eight t when you went to

772
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:08,351
ATC and started a training with some
serious talent down there and dropped down

773
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,130
to one 70.

774
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,023
I would like to know that,

775
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,830
that the period of no sparring,

776
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:17,230
I think that was the 85
period when he was at strike.

777
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,870
Well Chad,

778
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,980
Chad Mendez took a while off too cause
obviously he got busted but then he took

779
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:23,620
time off and then he's
looking frickin pretty gnarly.

780
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,110
Yeah,

781
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,550
Dude.

782
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,130
Um,

783
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,780
and haven't Dale Earnhardt junior on the
other day and talking to him about the,

784
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,910
the brain injuries that he
sustained from driving his car.

785
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:33,660
And I haven't heard.

786
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,390
Yeah,

787
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,070
horrible dude.

788
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:36,910
He got to,

789
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,260
couldn't walk across the room.

790
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,940
He had a hold on the tables and shit.

791
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,360
I was,

792
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,260
as he was walking me.

793
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:42,700
Did he say he's head concussion?

794
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,750
Does he know what's in it?

795
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:46,600
Something insane like 12
over a period of four years.

796
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:47,321
Holy Shit,

797
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,040
that's a lot.

798
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,730
I want to say it was something like 12
concussions over a period of 40 how's he

799
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:52,390
know?

800
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,223
He's great.

801
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,820
Super Nice Guy.

802
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,571
Very,

803
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:56,560
very genuine guy.

804
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,260
He said that the length popping up
says at least 20 fuck concussions.

805
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,150
It's more than some fighters.

806
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,991
God Damn it.

807
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,070
That's crazy.

808
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,240
That is so crazy.

809
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:09,280
But you know he's a lot,

810
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,500
a lot of like serious problems
that he had worked through,

811
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,730
but he found a good doctor that has
as good cognitive therapy really.

812
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,140
So he's had some kind
of side effects from it.

813
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,610
He had a bunch of side effects,

814
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:20,860
but they cleared them up
through these exercises.

815
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,630
Really interesting stuff like,

816
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:23,500
and he was basically,

817
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:24,820
I made the analogy that it's like,

818
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,470
is it like exercising your mind?

819
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,480
Like is just like exercising your body.

820
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,160
Like there's things you can do that
make things grow and make it an yeah and

821
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,921
make things strong.

822
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:37,240
Hurts CBD oil and fish oil if really
the exports that I know who are in that

823
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:41,170
field and with the brain always
tell me a tons of Fisher on CBD oil.

824
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,100
Krill oil too.

825
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:43,090
That stuff's real good.

826
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,690
Yup.

827
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,500
Yeah,

828
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,040
yeah.

829
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,401
Stuff.

830
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:48,580
Anything that reduces inflammation but um,

831
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,340
that damn Taylor and her thought crazy.

832
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
These guys decide that's that.

833
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:53,410
Some of them decide,

834
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:53,890
you know,

835
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,200
cowboy was doing that for
awhile and probably still is.

836
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,063
I don't know what he was doing,

837
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,821
what he's doing now.

838
00:22:57,821 --> 00:22:58,840
I didn't talk to him about this.

839
00:22:58,841 --> 00:22:59,920
CanNot sparring heavy.

840
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,150
It wasn't sparring at all.

841
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,430
He's just hitting pads.

842
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,240
Just hitting pads.

843
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,074
It's not that I know.

844
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,670
I ain't the horse idea man.

845
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,810
Boxers beg to differ.

846
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,430
You talked to any of those
boxers and they're like,

847
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:09,880
no,

848
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,630
I think it was a Loma
Chenko and a while to go.

849
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,220
We like to get a 12 rounds in
hard right before the fight,

850
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:18,911
like two weeks,

851
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,280
three weeks out and then we cut
it off like three weeks out.

852
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:21,641
Just make,

853
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:25,750
see where we're at and
cutting about boxing though
is your hands are wrapped up.

854
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,771
You know your,

855
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:27,940
your gloves are on,

856
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:28,450
they've got,

857
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,470
you've got 16 ounce training gloves
or maybe even 20 if you're a beast,

858
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:32,861
right?

859
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:37,861
You've got big ass puppy 16 you got big
ass puffy gloves and there's no kicking.

860
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,260
The thing about like kicking it,

861
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,620
like to see,

862
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,460
I bought Sam's book,

863
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,790
I'd feel like boxing is more dangerous.

864
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,780
It is in a way that all they're doing is
head hunting all it's all head and it's

865
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:51,500
just head.

866
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:51,801
Right?

867
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,150
But especially at that level.

868
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,320
Well,

869
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,410
you're not getting kicked.

870
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,101
I know,

871
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,780
but in in like high level,

872
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:00,400
Jim's like black house or
a t t a k people there,

873
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:03,110
they're not really going to throw
those kicks as hard as they can.

874
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,801
Man.

875
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,740
I don't know about all the Shit
fucking old school shoot box.

876
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,490
There's a lot of,

877
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:07,851
gosh,

878
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,680
they're still going after it like that.

879
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,770
There's a lot of guys that will still
talk to you about the benefits of going

880
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:13,130
after it.

881
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,960
Like that.

882
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,793
Yeah.

883
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,020
Out for Rasa.

884
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,710
Hobby was sandy gets guys who
try to kill George Saint Pierre.

885
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,640
He give him extra money if you can knock
them out just because he's so good.

886
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:23,630
No doing shit.

887
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,493
He's so good.

888
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,330
They're not doing it to
she names nightmare card.

889
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,560
He wants to be in danger for us wants
Georgian and danger in legitimate danger.

890
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,300
So his in his mind is you put George in
legitimate danger all the time in the

891
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:39,740
gym and he figures out a way to get
through that and he gets comfortable with

892
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,390
that so that when it comes to the fight,

893
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,890
it's the same thing.

894
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,160
That's easy to say if you and
George St and I love for us,

895
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:49,700
but when you have George St Pierre who's
the smartest dude to ever run of the

896
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:52,010
full marks guys ever fight
and he's so technical,

897
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,660
you whoever you're
going to bring in there,

898
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,750
you're not going to hit Joe.

899
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,581
Let me ask you this.

900
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,720
He's so maybe,

901
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,920
maybe there's benefit and
not when you're early going,

902
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,460
when you're learning technique more
and you're really learning timing and

903
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,270
pacing.

904
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,930
Maybe then is when you should spar,

905
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,790
like way more technical.

906
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,520
But then when you get
older and you're better,

907
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:18,170
like maybe you need the fear of an actual
fight and then then you can just slide

908
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,030
right into the fight.

909
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,350
Smart cause you're now also
cause your head movements better.

910
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:21,700
Your mood.

911
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,190
Yeah.

912
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,700
Smarter,

913
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,810
protect yourself more.

914
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:26,840
But the danger is still a hundred percent
real so that we're aware of all the

915
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,480
day.

916
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,860
Yep.

917
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,120
So that way when you're in a fight,

918
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,860
it feels exactly like your training.

919
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,723
It's not a bad idea.

920
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,070
Useful,

921
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,841
but you're already there.

922
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,790
You're already at a high
level of proficiency.

923
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,260
You already have the tools.

924
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,830
Did I really think that there's an a
real issue with fighters and this is a

925
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:45,170
impossible to tell after it's over
right after the career's over.

926
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,801
Like what,

927
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,150
why did they do it this way?

928
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,590
What if they had done it that way?

929
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:49,730
Maybe it would've worked better.

930
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:49,851
Well,

931
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:50,090
you know,

932
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,331
you know,

933
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,170
Chuck Liddell,

934
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,143
um,

935
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,400
is he's not with Hackleman
for this TRTs fight.

936
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,550
He just shot that like was an
old school type of training.

937
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:00,170
So I decided to go somewhere else.

938
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,850
I was training with Einstein.

939
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,960
Izzy.

940
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,890
Well listen,

941
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,420
I'm a big fan of uh,

942
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,010
Einstein as a Jujitsu.

943
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,883
I Dunno,

944
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,070
I dunno.

945
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,000
And strength and
conditioning costs on about,

946
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,330
yeah,

947
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,250
he knows a lot about slow movement,

948
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,960
slow movement lifting,

949
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,201
you know,

950
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:16,310
slowly like he's a,

951
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,233
what does he call it?

952
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,570
What does,

953
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,850
I don't know what the style is.

954
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,770
It's all super slow.

955
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:22,311
That's what it is.

956
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:22,770
Right.

957
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,190
This is working with Antonio Mckee.

958
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,320
Mckee was he like working with him?

959
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,030
Um,

960
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,750
but uh,

961
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,830
I've known that dude forever.

962
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,760
How long have you known that dude?

963
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,770
He was in King of the cage when I
used to commentate back in 2000.

964
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:37,520
And he's a damn good
fighter for a long time.

965
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:37,970
Right.

966
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,470
His son is awesome.

967
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,070
The Antenna Mickey San Antonio Mckee,

968
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,163
Toro.

969
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,700
I was talking about Einstein.

970
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,150
He's,

971
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,720
oh my bed.

972
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,470
But no know.

973
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,430
But both of them,

974
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,210
chuck is training with uh,

975
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,910
what's a gym called?

976
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,680
Power garage or some shit like that.

977
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:53,280
Sure.

978
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,821
I forget,

979
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,840
but that's where Chuck's at.

980
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,760
Cause cause what I heard on the street
and I'll say I fucking love John

981
00:26:59,760 --> 00:26:59,761
Hackleman.

982
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:00,630
Shout up John Hockman,

983
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:02,790
but it was such an old
school way of training.

984
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:03,031
He's like,

985
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:03,271
dude,

986
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,370
it's the to advance so fast.

987
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:06,390
I need to go somewhere.

988
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,680
Which workers saw that?

989
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:11,550
He goes down to Jay Glazer's
place to right the unbreakable.

990
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,470
I don't know if they're
in business together.

991
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:14,640
He's been there forever.

992
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,990
He's been one of the starters.

993
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:16,590
What?

994
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,740
How would a dope place Jay
Glazer put together a sunset?

995
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,080
It's amazing.

996
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:22,980
Have you been there chuck?

997
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:23,641
No Man.

998
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,271
I've never been,

999
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:27,930
but I've seen all these videos are
really con might displace is crazy.

1000
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,310
Snoop Dogg's in there,

1001
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,380
Wiz Khalifa,

1002
00:27:30,381 --> 00:27:30,870
sparring.

1003
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,050
Somebody's Pete Denny was in
that were one of the jail.

1004
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,180
You know I'm Wiz Khalifa?

1005
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:36,630
Nope.

1006
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,841
No.

1007
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:41,841
Snoop Dogg rather sparred with a
legit sparred with Daniel Seraphin.

1008
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,150
Snoop Dogg was Seraphin
wasn't hitting them.

1009
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,993
He goes,

1010
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,380
but let's look at this.

1011
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,250
Snoop is in there and Seraphina just
kind of using head movement and kind of

1012
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,390
touching them a little bit,

1013
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:57,390
but you know how fucking
goddamn terrifying that must be.

1014
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,090
Does this have gloves
on in front of Seraphim?

1015
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,460
Do you think snoop knows?

1016
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,131
Is he aware?

1017
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:02,964
I don't think so.

1018
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,590
He's got so probably told them was like,

1019
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:05,941
hey man,

1020
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:06,774
you know what the guy's done.

1021
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,610
That guy might not be,

1022
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:08,910
you know,

1023
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,200
the best in the world.

1024
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,460
He might not be the best world,

1025
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:13,890
but he's a fucking monster.

1026
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,481
Dude.

1027
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:15,600
Come back to snoop.

1028
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:18,840
He is built like shit leg.

1029
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,260
He's so strong too black twizzler and he
cuts a Shitload of weight to that guy's

1030
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,880
a gigantic what?

1031
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,300
Wade is a seraphim fight.

1032
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:30,300
I want to say fights at
85 but he's super jacked.

1033
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,950
He's a thicket.

1034
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,830
Damn straight steal.

1035
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,610
Just a real dangerous dude.

1036
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,740
So to see him in their
sparring with snoop dog,

1037
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:37,921
I'm like,

1038
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:41,400
I wonder if Snoop Dogg
understands that this is like,

1039
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,580
it's like Paul and at a a
giant pit bull or something.

1040
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,211
You know,

1041
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:46,044
I wonder.

1042
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,550
I don't think he know to what level.

1043
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,630
I don't know.

1044
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,463
I mean you're a Sikh.

1045
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,920
You ever seen one that has got ball?

1046
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:52,380
Snoop dog's got real balls.

1047
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,790
Did Not just do that,

1048
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,110
but to do that and put it up,

1049
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,830
make a video of it and look true and dude.

1050
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,380
And it didn't look like an asshole.

1051
00:28:59,680 --> 00:28:59,920
No,

1052
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,280
it didn't look like an ass for a guide.

1053
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,530
It's not a like a long time combat sport,

1054
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,910
notable athletes,

1055
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,481
you know what I mean?

1056
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:08,220
He's not like some guy
we've known about like,

1057
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,360
like if you saw,

1058
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,050
um,

1059
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,501
like there's,

1060
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,300
there's some guys like Mario Lopez,

1061
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,240
if you saw Mario Lopez box
and when somebody you'd go,

1062
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:15,630
yeah,

1063
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,560
that guy can box.

1064
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,993
Everybody knows it.

1065
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:18,681
Everybody.

1066
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:19,650
He has smokers.

1067
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,920
Like everybody knows Mario Lopez smokers.

1068
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,211
Yeah.

1069
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:22,501
Yeah.

1070
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,910
He smoker gets a friend of mine.

1071
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,140
I think Frank Gallo it.

1072
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:25,861
Fuck him up.

1073
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:26,070
But,

1074
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,780
oh wow.

1075
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,600
Dario.

1076
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,410
I know he punched Acey Slade and I do,

1077
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,510
I've seen,

1078
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,720
I've trained with frank man.

1079
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,100
He's feisty one.

1080
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:35,340
Yeah,

1081
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,030
I believe you.

1082
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,211
I mean,

1083
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:36,960
he looks tough,

1084
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,010
but Lopez can fight.

1085
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:38,910
I think,

1086
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,743
you know.

1087
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,560
Yeah.

1088
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,040
I think you need is a

1089
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,551
wildcard.

1090
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,590
West for wafer carries himself.

1091
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,110
This is one of the reasons why I think
he really knows how to box when I'm

1092
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:48,340
around really arrogant way.

1093
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,420
Not really arrogant,

1094
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:49,900
but it's,

1095
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,440
he's,

1096
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,460
he knows how to fight.

1097
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,230
He's a nice guy.

1098
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,300
Do you remember our buddy?

1099
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,810
Uh,

1100
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,920
he was a porn star.

1101
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,360
He was the one who,

1102
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,194
uh,

1103
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,700
who fought Mario Lopez,

1104
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,690
goddammit Derek my out and his real name.

1105
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:05,741
Oh Dude,

1106
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:06,574
there's still porn.

1107
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,443
Oh,

1108
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,110
black guy.

1109
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,943
Jared diamond.

1110
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,560
It's not dark.

1111
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,350
Dark Diamond Tyler night.

1112
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,363
Tyler night.

1113
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:15,810
Oh,

1114
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,690
that's his porno name.

1115
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,850
Totally lights weren't on there.

1116
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,723
What a great.

1117
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,430
And he's also an author and he,

1118
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:21,760
um,

1119
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,640
he runs like crazy
marathons and shit now too.

1120
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,300
Doesn't he still dicking girls down?

1121
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:26,950
It was just older,

1122
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm not sure.

1123
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,540
So anyway,

1124
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,460
he had an amateur fight.

1125
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,570
He used to go to 10th planet.

1126
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,733
Really Nice Guy.

1127
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,040
And he had an amateur
fight with Mario Lopez.

1128
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,390
He had one of them smokers.

1129
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:38,370
Like how do you go day?

1130
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,400
Mario dropped him,

1131
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:44,020
I think ac Slater fuck the most and
Mara Matas either stopped him or he won,

1132
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,500
um,

1133
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,333
a decision,

1134
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,260
but Tyler dropped him Tarla drop morrow.

1135
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,150
So it was a real fight.

1136
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,930
So it,

1137
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,920
that to me like,

1138
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,180
because Tyler was jacked,

1139
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:53,770
he was like super powerful back then.

1140
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,540
And I think that if he can come back
from getting dropped and still win,

1141
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,380
you know,

1142
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,180
he's Mario,

1143
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,871
no shit too.

1144
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,910
When it comes to box and I've done
a podcast on just about boxing.

1145
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm sure he knows his shit
when you guy really is a,

1146
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,020
you know,

1147
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,853
I mean,

1148
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,930
I'd like to see him do something.

1149
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,390
I've never seen him actually box somebody.

1150
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:13,751
No,

1151
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,300
me neither does any like 45 yeah.

1152
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,790
So do you think it is everybody in here?

1153
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:19,421
Yeah,

1154
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,320
he looks beautiful.

1155
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:20,981
He's got perfect.

1156
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:22,000
I know what he's doing,

1157
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,893
but it's working.

1158
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,733
How old are you?

1159
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,650
35 he looks younger than you do.

1160
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,960
Mario Lopez don't have a
wrinkle on his pretty face.

1161
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:29,201
Dude.

1162
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:30,610
Ac Slater has an age,

1163
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,440
whatever moisturizer he's got.

1164
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,303
I want

1165
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,533
Brian.

1166
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,753
Brian.

1167
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,261
Dude,

1168
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:39,580
I haven't watched one second.

1169
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:40,840
This fight I ever needed.

1170
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,220
Several fights there.

1171
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,000
Well not there.

1172
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,833
He looks like.

1173
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,560
Feels like.

1174
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,830
Say you get stung by all
the bs and the cheeks.

1175
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:48,664
Then

1176
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,830
Super Nice guy too.

1177
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,641
Really,

1178
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:52,240
really nice.

1179
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,670
Joe Professional to hosting.

1180
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:55,504
He's abused.

1181
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,510
Who's blowing up faster than Leo?

1182
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,160
Theo Vaughn feel Vaughn's killer.

1183
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,350
He's out there.

1184
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,900
He's,

1185
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,740
it's a funny guy,

1186
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:03,071
man.

1187
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:04,540
He's a really funny guy.

1188
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,250
That whole rat king at the strap thing.

1189
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,460
You know that he's got going podcast.

1190
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,890
He sits hysterical.

1191
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,731
He's so funny.

1192
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,080
He's a belt to all the shows.

1193
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:14,290
You know,

1194
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,280
it takes pictures with fans.

1195
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,090
Peanut strap that funny.

1196
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,450
They came in as a wrestler.

1197
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:19,750
Well,

1198
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,830
when we had wrapped port on,

1199
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:21,664
he came in as like,

1200
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,490
oh man,

1201
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,201
he's crazy.

1202
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:24,034
He's so funny.

1203
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,370
He's hilarious and he's such a good guy.

1204
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,470
Super happy to see dude,

1205
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,610
when we did that,

1206
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:33,070
a show in Phoenix with Ari.

1207
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,953
Oh Yay.

1208
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,960
Big Crazy show.

1209
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:36,160
Ryan Theo.

1210
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,250
Theo fricking destroyed,

1211
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,363
destroyed.

1212
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:40,971
It was so much.

1213
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:41,960
We always destroys.

1214
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,460
Every time I see him he's like,

1215
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,210
um,

1216
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,350
he's not just funny.

1217
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:45,770
Right?

1218
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,910
He's funny and you,

1219
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,773
you like,

1220
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,230
you don't know anybody like him.

1221
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:49,910
I've never heard it.

1222
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,743
He's so good.

1223
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,740
His upbringing from New Orleans and
being in therapy since he was like seven.

1224
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,130
He's such a unique dude,

1225
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,720
man.

1226
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,171
He's really,

1227
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:57,920
really unique.

1228
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,753
It's real good.

1229
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,590
I'll tell you who else
I've never really hung out.

1230
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:02,930
Was with a big J big.

1231
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:03,740
Jay's a big chase.

1232
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,430
Awesome.

1233
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,780
He's hilarious.

1234
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,920
He's a great guy.

1235
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,570
All those legion of skanks guys,

1236
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,920
those guys are the best.

1237
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,180
I don't know any nice guys.

1238
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,931
I just know it well.

1239
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:12,770
I know big J now.

1240
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,633
Do you know Louis?

1241
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,473
I don't know metals.

1242
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,373
Louis is great.

1243
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,290
There's,

1244
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,270
there's Gomez.

1245
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,890
Um,

1246
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,890
there's there just Dave Smith who's
I've had on my podcast of gang times.

1247
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,590
If you ever wanted someone
to understand that,

1248
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,040
that could understand politics
and actually be funny.

1249
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,700
Oh yeah.

1250
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,511
He's really good at that.

1251
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:29,660
Yeah.

1252
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,530
He's a libertarian.

1253
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:31,364
He's one of those guys,

1254
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,900
which usually means like a white
guy with a gun and no disrespect.

1255
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,830
Only time I ever listened
to the show was when,

1256
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:37,460
uh,

1257
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,000
uh,

1258
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,530
it was about the cause.

1259
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:43,820
I think they had one of the dudes on
the show when Amy Schumer like rob the

1260
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,390
stage.

1261
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,240
Remember that New York I listened
to that cause big Jay was like,

1262
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,950
kind of give me the benefit of the doubt.

1263
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,680
But then the restaurant,

1264
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,540
we're just roasting here.

1265
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,460
This is the one time it's hilarious.

1266
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,700
Yeah.

1267
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:54,920
Uh,

1268
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,270
was Ari on that one as well?

1269
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,630
Yeah.

1270
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,020
Yeah.

1271
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,370
He goes super hard in the paint.

1272
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,440
He does go hard and Ari's great man.

1273
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,820
He's not here to play games.

1274
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,600
He's great.

1275
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,431
He didn't give a fuck Ari's,

1276
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:04,430
he's an animal dude.

1277
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,100
That motherfucker went from not working
out at all to doing this sober October

1278
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:12,170
fitness challenge and getting,

1279
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,873
you know,

1280
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,380
like hundreds of points more than Tom
Ziglar and Bert Kreischer guys who work

1281
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:19,214
out all the time.

1282
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,820
Tom and per workout all the time.

1283
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:21,340
All the time.

1284
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,300
I mean burn off steam.

1285
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,710
I mean Tom looks good,

1286
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,870
but from where they're from,

1287
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,700
but they're not like in shape.

1288
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:29,510
I love bolts and bolt,

1289
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,931
but bro,

1290
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,250
it's all on where they're starting from.

1291
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,180
I know,

1292
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,013
I know.

1293
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,230
Starting from a place where they
were both really overweight and they,

1294
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,660
they talked themselves into
this weight loss challenge.

1295
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,781
They lost all the weight.

1296
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:40,850
Tom Kept it off.

1297
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,020
Tom Looks amazing,

1298
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,830
looks amazing and kind to,

1299
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,380
I don't want bridge fluctuating.

1300
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,303
It's been fun.

1301
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,100
But Taiwan,

1302
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,640
I'm skinny.

1303
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,500
Manawan I'm healthy.

1304
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,460
But is this the new rocky
movie commercials that what?

1305
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:53,294
This house,

1306
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,250
I'm going to go on forever.

1307
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,001
I love it there.

1308
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:56,900
Michael B.

1309
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,100
Jordan do all the steroids.

1310
00:34:58,101 --> 00:34:58,950
He's jacked,

1311
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,780
jacked.

1312
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,860
He's creepy jacked.

1313
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,050
He's like super athlete jacked.

1314
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,353
He's so,

1315
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,880
he's so good at like being a bad guy too.

1316
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:10,400
He was great in that Black
Panther movie has a bad guy.

1317
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,660
I can whatever.

1318
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:13,110
I see Michael Jordan's name.

1321
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,060
Jordan stands for basketball.

1322
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:20,571
Crazy,

1323
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:21,404
right?

1324
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,353
I go back

1325
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,030

1326
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,540

1327
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,260
Oh Dude.

1328
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,120
He's like one of the silliest guys ever.

1329
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,830
He makes me laugh so hard,

1330
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:37,380
man.

1331
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,100
Man.

1332
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,881
He's not just funny.

1333
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:39,810
He's so silly.

1334
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:40,920
Like that kind of shit.

1335
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,600
The beast eds for basketball.

1336
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,320
I do just that.

1337
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,273
It's so

1338
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,580
great.

1339
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,430
It's so good.

1340
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,320
But that he does that all the time.

1341
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:56,130
Like is his Instagram feed
is all just him being silly.

1342
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,260
Dude's like he's bored all day till it
gets on stage and he just does silly

1343
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,280
shops shop.

1344
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,650
Making fun of people walk into the
coffee shop to funny comic to Matt Deleon

1345
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,090
makes me laugh harder than anyone.

1346
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,311
Man.

1347
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,330
He's a funny guy.

1348
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,920
You know Larry,

1349
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,000
but I think I love him on stage,

1350
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:17,001
but I think I like him as much when
he does is a silly internet shit too.

1351
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,440
Like when you see,

1352
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,700
I don't know why he keeps going.

1353
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,720
He keeps going out by him
while he goes out to everybody,

1354
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:25,400
man.

1355
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,070
Dude,

1356
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,620
you see when he was in metabolism,

1357
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,610
when he's entertaining
rapping like m and m.

1358
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,810
Yes.

1359
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,730
Oh my God.

1360
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,060
And I told them cause meaning that me
and him love Worldstar hip hop and I made

1361
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,430
it on there and then he made on it.

1362
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:38,910
So I sent them the link.

1363
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:39,211
I went,

1364
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:39,690

1365
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,523

1366
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,601

1370
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,830
for something that's hilarious for this.

1371
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,030
Just making it up as he gets
tossed to get an abortion.

1372
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:56,060
Then the divorce thing,

1373
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,470
time to hear with the forum,

1374
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,850
the candidates doing this,

1375
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:06,740
why are you panicking and you're looking
to stay on at mannequins and I'm going

1376
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:09,320
on a fan of kids trying
to get up a planet.

1377
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,183
Gifts,

1378
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,040
complaining.

1379
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,740
Constantin Capanpan

1380
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,910
I'm in a companion banner
chant and on a standup banner.

1381
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,290
Well,

1382
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,470
you don't got to stay on one
and get a link and a stamina.

1383
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,701
Do you see the edit?

1384
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:33,310
They did Jamie on m and m's
actual body with the video.

1385
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:34,144
It's ridiculous.

1386
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:36,980
Oh,

1387
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,930
he can pull it off,

1388
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:38,200
man.

1389
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,100
He's so silly.

1390
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:39,281
Yeah,

1391
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:40,114
that's a good,

1392
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,200
that's a good example.

1393
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:43,220
Like we were talking about
the over guy who's just,

1394
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,140
he's got his own uniquely
ridiculous kind of comedy.

1395
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,940
Which some strange reason
when you talked to a,

1396
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,390
or you talked to any of his
friends who've known him forever.

1397
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:52,900
They're like,

1398
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,081
no,

1399
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:55,480
all he's wanting to do since he
was a kid has made people laugh.

1400
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,770
This is lily what he's meant to do.

1401
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,540
Yeah.

1402
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,950
I guess just the filariasis silly dude.

1403
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,830
Remember he's huge on
vine before it went away.

1404
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:03,011
I mean,

1405
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:03,760
you're talking,

1406
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,230
he's one of the main stars on vine,

1407
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:06,640
man for doing this type of stuff.

1408
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,513
Makes Sense.

1409
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:07,900
Meals,

1410
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,280
that kind of shelves all day.

1411
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,320
His Instagram's great.

1412
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:10,660
Oh,

1413
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,060
if I could post the
texts that he sends me.

1414
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,570
I mean you get millions and
millions that they're so funny.

1415
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:17,070
Man.

1416
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,970

1418
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,883
Then he had an,

1419
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,251
he goes,

1420
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:21,581

1421
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,980
something's wrong with my
microwave and then hits the button.

1422
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,260
Just all this cash faucet

1423
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,870
cause I'm know hook to do.

1424
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,360
We always send each other pictures
of our check rather reason.

1425
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:35,194
Just talking.

1426
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,490
That's hilarious.

1427
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,540
That's hilarious.

1428
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:37,871
Yeah.

1429
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:38,980
He's a funny dude.

1430
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,450
How fun is it having friends
that are comedians the best,

1431
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,580
the most fun to hang with the best.

1432
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,320
Everybody's always being silly.

1433
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,850
Everybody's always
putting you in your place.

1434
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:49,823
Oh,

1435
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,450

1436
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,750
You're like,

1437
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,620
oh no,

1438
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,560
I love Chris because he
dresses like a fuck boy too.

1439
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:58,600
So if I wear this jacket
to the comedy store,

1440
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,740

Yeah.

1446
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:07,810
You guys can talk about
different clothing manufacturers.

1447
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,280
Do you know any Eddie?

1448
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:13,720
Do you know any clothing
designers and some of the coachee?

1449
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,820
Bon Jor in those jeans?

1450
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,100
[inaudible] Versace means
you don't remember bonds,

1451
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:18,940

1452
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,620
What about Sergio Valenti?

1453
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,041
Listen,

1454
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,510
this is all old stuff.

1455
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,160
That's old school.

1456
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,490
But what I'm saying is this motherfucker
could probably rattle off like gang or

1457
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,090
is that still good?

1458
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,241
Yeah.

1459
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:28,481
Good.

1460
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:28,901
She's good.

1461
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:30,310
Just talking right now off whites.

1462
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:32,490
The biggest brand in the world off white,

1463
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,333
off white right now.

1464
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,313
Dan,

1465
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,690
a materialist woman's dude.

1466
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,070
I'm a materialist woman's dream.

1467
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,960
Think about this.

1468
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,770
You're a big old gorilla of a guy.

1469
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,900
You got big Dick Energy Fat Dick.

1470
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:44,471
You're right about that.

1471
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:45,460
You're a manly man,

1472
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:49,090
but yet you're into fashion soup and
don't suck Dick with this jacket.

1473
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,530
Leopard skin jacket on.

1474
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:50,801
Nothing.

1475
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:54,970
But the point is that you really do
enjoy it and you're not shy about it now.

1476
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,750
Now love it.

1477
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,441
This is what I like.

1478
00:39:56,441 --> 00:40:00,580
I like give me a name of an obscure
designer that you really love his work.

1479
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,390
Mark Mason.

1480
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,680
See her follows like women's
dresses and shit too.

1481
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:08,970

Like I'll tell him,

1484
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,290
I'll tell my girl to wear
or like shoes or like a,

1485
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,580

1490
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:20,524
I knew what it was.

1491
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:20,891
I was like,

1492
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:22,000
that person is sick.

1493
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,531
And Tony's like,

1494
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:24,880

1497
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,350
you just don't know what it is.

1498
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,740
It's like,

1499
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,640
well listen,

1500
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,780
I don't know why.

1501
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,810
Why did a style and aesthetics,

1502
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:34,930
why did that become a homosexual
activity only or a female?

1503
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,381
Yeah.

1504
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:36,910
I don't know to where it,

1505
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,920
this is why.

1506
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,980
Because I bought that shit because
sometimes people want to staple a regular

1507
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,570
shirt on the outside of a tee shirt.

1508
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:44,261
Pretend it's not.

1509
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:45,070
We're talking to you.

1510
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,030
That's not fashion.

1511
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,141
How many times,

1512
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:49,270
if it seems to hold myself back a bunch,

1513
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,950
but what's the 10 no.

1514
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,550
Okay.

1515
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,383
Zoo Lander.

1516
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,110
The lander.

1517
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:53,741
I never saw it,

1518
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,920
but I've seen clips I've never seen so
ever since I heard the second one's a

1519
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:57,301
bomber.

1520
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:57,760
No,

1521
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,550
you got to see zoo lander with Brendan.

1522
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,753
You guys

1523
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,370
smoke weed.

1524
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:03,701
Yeah,

1525
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:04,510
totally.

1526
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,350
I was watching a clip the
other day from tropic thunder.

1527
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,333
Oh my God.

1528
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,173
Classic.

1529
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,563
It's up there.

1530
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:15,040
There's two things you
can't do ever again.

1531
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,450
After tropic thunder.

1532
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:19,650
You can't be a white guy
wearing blackface pretty cheap.

1533
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,160
You can't say retard.

1534
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:21,571
Well.

1535
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:22,404
Yeah,

1536
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,500
like simple is done so you
can do simple jacket again.

1537
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:26,920
Yeah.

1538
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,140
But remember you never go full retard.

1539
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,750
I mean that was one of the
big lines in the movie.

1540
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,280
You literally do that today.

1541
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:34,950
You can't play,

1542
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,580
you can't make fun of
playing a real person,

1543
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,100
like four people that had
done blackface since this,

1544
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:42,530
I mean a deal from Saturday night live.

1545
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,280
Um,

1546
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,113
there's a list of them.

1547
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,060
No,

1548
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,680
seriously,

1549
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,330
I just a major motion picture.

1550
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,560
Not a major motion picture,

1551
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:49,650
but Saturday night live.

1552
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,470
Even if I'm wrong,

1553
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,850
like exactly.

1554
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:57,560
Maybe someone did it afterwards
and culturally like that
is the last big moment.

1555
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,170
You might be right that other
people have done it since then.

1556
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,860
It's find out what was the last time
someone black face in the movie?

1557
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,600
Did you know what Dave Chappelle,

1558
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,990
Dave Chappelle does white face
that doesn't care Mexican aisle.

1559
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:09,860
That was years ago.

1560
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:14,210
It doesn't extra time out on the
Chappelle show 10 years ago and he's also

1561
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:15,044
doesn't count.

1562
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,930
White faced is not the same as black face.

1563
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,900
Black face existed back
in the Al Jolson days.

1564
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:21,734
He ever see that shit.

1565
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,371
You ever see?

1566
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:25,920
Like when the minstrel
quite guys on black dudes,

1567
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,140
you ever watch it?

1568
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,620
No.

1569
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,970
It's crazy.

1570
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,631
You're like,

1571
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,800
what is this?

1572
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,551
Like what?

1573
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,384
It's weird.

1574
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,081
It is.

1575
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:33,320
Fuck.

1576
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,830
Look at that.

1577
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,280
God,

1578
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,090
Doug does.

1579
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,220
So racer and he would
have to have white lips.

1580
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,090
Is that this?

1581
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:39,650
Does that make it official?

1582
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,410
I don't think he looks
just like a regular black.

1583
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,970
They just made it to hit lips look bigger.

1584
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,493
I mean that's the,

1585
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,750
that's what the white does.

1586
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,340
100% yeah,

1587
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:49,561
they're,

1588
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:53,720
they're trying to make him
have exaggerated looking
lips because in contrast to

1589
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:54,554
the black,

1590
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,490
it looks like lips.

1591
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:59,450
Just like when a girl puts lipstick and
she outlines it outside of her lips,

1592
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,320
makes her lips look bigger.

1593
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:01,790
That's exactly what
these people are doing.

1594
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,850
So this is what they did and they
wouldn't let black people in the movies.

1595
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,190
Black people couldn't be
like the star of a movie.

1596
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:10,730
They didn't have to be a white guy
playing a black guy in black face.

1597
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,160
Did you see Sean White
dress up as simple jacking?

1598
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,690
Got Roasted for it?

1599
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:15,350
Who Really?

1600
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,130
Come on.

1601
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,140
Shaun white is the Olympic snowboarder.

1602
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,150
Monster gold medalists.

1603
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:20,361
Yeah.

1604
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:21,194
Math Games.

1605
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,483
Flying Tomato.

1606
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,340
You know what's crazy is like these
days you can't talk to my shit no more.

1607
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,470
But the gender thing isn't
there like 60 some genders.

1608
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:35,250
They're supposed to be a bunch of
different gender Telmo now like six,

1609
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:35,730
right?

1610
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:35,940
Yeah,

1611
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,040
but they don't,

1612
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,290
they're not saying is 60 genders,

1613
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,440
but what they are saying is they should
have the right to dictate what pronoun

1614
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,680
that that you use instead of him or her.

1615
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,390
If they want like Xer orZ ,

1616
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,820
they make up a bunch of these wacky,

1617
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,260
but how many are there really?

1618
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:55,250
There's man,

1619
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,113
woman,

1620
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,223
man,

1621
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:57,861
dude,

1622
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,700
born as man,

1623
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:01,220
but it woman inside woman,

1624
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,120
born woman,

1625
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:03,210
but man inside.

1626
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:09,010
And then the fifth one might be a man
who feels like he's man and woman and

1627
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,120
maybe they're six or seven.

1628
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,003
How many,

1629
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,380
how many associate with that though?

1630
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:17,090
Some of them say they
don't associate with them.

1631
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:18,530
Then there's asexual that seven,

1632
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,040
like one hand sexual guy who
doesn't think he's a guy or a girl.

1633
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,960
What does isn't pan?

1634
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,950
You just love to fuck pansexual,

1635
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,700
whatever going.

1636
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,581
It's all good.

1637
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,240
I'll panel pansexual.

1638
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,920
Is it Monday through Friday?

1639
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:33,120
I'm a fucking dude.

1640
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,220
Saturdays,

1641
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,620
Fridays,

1642
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,161
Saturday night.

1643
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:35,970
I'm a fucking chick.

1644
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:36,241
Yes.

1645
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,074
Gender fluid.

1646
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:37,861
Yeah,

1647
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:38,700
they go back and forth.

1648
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,400
I don't know why there was a
whole radio on the weekend.

1649
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,950
There was a whole radio lab podcasts about
it and I was laughing my ass off when

1650
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:47,401
I was listening.

1651
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:48,210
To me,

1652
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,470
there's parts of it that it
was so preposterous because
it was a guy who would

1653
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:55,440
just decide while he's talking and he's
a girl and because this is like a super

1654
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:58,830
progressive show cause radio lab
is this like really well made,

1655
00:44:58,831 --> 00:44:59,664
really high,

1656
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,160
fucking super well edited.

1657
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,400
They connect.

1658
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:08,410
They literally can't say this guy might
have some problems with his perception

1659
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:09,121
to reality.

1660
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:09,570
Yeah.

1661
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,340
This might not just be a gender thing
or maybe it is a gender thing or is it

1662
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,243
split?

1663
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:13,830
Right,

1664
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,960
but you have to have both
options on the table.

1665
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:18,330
Like this guy might be
fucking crazy and he,

1666
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,111
the guy was a man.

1667
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:19,860
Then you just go,

1668
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,693
oh I just flipped.

1669
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,421
I just flipped him.

1670
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:21,751
The woman,

1671
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:23,010
now it's this size.

1672
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,451
He goes back,

1673
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:25,284
he's the man again,

1674
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,690
but you can't,

1675
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,980
when it comes to gender,

1676
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:29,501
here's the thing,

1677
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:30,420
because he get mad.

1678
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,790
You can't have these thoughts.

1679
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,020
You can't question.

1680
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,090
You can't cause I don't know.

1681
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,953
I'm not him.

1682
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:37,883
Right.

1683
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,000
Maybe that's a thing.

1684
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:42,060
Maybe you do just flip back and forth
from feeling like you're a guy or feeling

1685
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:42,894
like you're,

1686
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,000
or maybe that's crazy.

1687
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,700
That's possible to be fucking crazy.

1688
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,720
Then it might be some kind of
delusion that's involved in this.

1689
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,091
Again,

1690
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:51,870
maybe or,

1691
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,501
but the thing is,

1692
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:53,250
if he wants to do that,

1693
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,050
I don't give a flying shit,

1694
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:57,070
but don't get mad at me if I
don't call you the right prone.

1695
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,050
If I don't call him right now,

1696
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,560
I don't.

1697
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,500
We don't know if he did get mad or
she got mad depending on who she was.

1698
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:07,501
And what percentage is there a
high rate of suicide for people?

1699
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,610
For dudes that chop their
dicks off transgender.

1700
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,000
Right.

1701
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,270
50% think whether or not they
go through the operation.

1702
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:17,130
There's still a very high rate of suicide,

1703
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:17,610
but trash.

1704
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:17,830
Yeah,

1705
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,420
transgenders,

1706
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,420
50% so here's the,

1707
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,910
you cut off your Dick.

1708
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,910
You should be on suicide watch,

1709
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:24,450
right?

1710
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,950
I mean that's huge.

1711
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,370
Well,

1712
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:26,911
it's huge,

1713
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:30,660
but I don't think it's affected them
that they regret come their dicks off.

1714
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,670
Put the no the hormones.

1715
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,280
I think that's what
fucks with their brains.

1716
00:46:34,281 --> 00:46:34,590
Stuff like,

1717
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,350
cause then you're,

1718
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,520
you're messing with the
biological system of your body,

1719
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:38,731
right?

1720
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:39,420
Yeah,

1721
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,500
I came straight all that.

1722
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,910
I think [inaudible] right,

1723
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,210
man.

1724
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,410
If you're a man,

1725
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:45,720
but you're feeling like a woman inside,

1726
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,850
I'd say it just keep your Dick.

1727
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,840
You know what I mean?

1728
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,850
Cause it's gonna it.

1729
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,001
You Chop it off.

1730
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:53,140
You're going to lose
all those orgasms minus,

1731
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,660
we'll have orgasms to do.

1732
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,730
You can't have orgasms
if you chop your Dick,

1733
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,360
cause I'm doing chicks
were tits with fat Dick.

1734
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,380
I don't think so.

1735
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,170
Dicks,

1736
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,200
they keep their pleasure.

1737
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:06,034
Pat,

1738
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,103
keep up.

1739
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,830
You're going to get rid of your orgasm
unless you're born with like a deformed

1740
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:11,160
Dick.

1741
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,731
Oh my God.

1742
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:14,910
I mean we're missing the
craziest girl Tko of all time.

1743
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,210
This girl is getting smashed harbor
doing some cough drops and some horrific

1744
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:21,570
bombs down.

1745
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,500
Oh my God.

1746
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,490
These girls are,

1747
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,241
oh my God.

1748
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:24,721
Big Elbow.

1749
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:25,380
This reverence.

1750
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,560
Damn Raf to get in the damn.

1751
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:29,560
She got blasted

1752
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,080
some shots.

1753
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:32,411
Hey,

1754
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:33,190
it's a fight game.

1755
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,020
Yep.

1756
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,080
So just getting paid for it.

1757
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,741
Ah Damn.

1758
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:36,574
That was wild.

1759
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,140
She got blood on the full on it.

1760
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:38,520
Shirt.

1761
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,340
Powerful on it.

1762
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,280
The ice man.

1763
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,800
Shout out in the audience.

1764
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,663
Shout out.

1765
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,460
Oh,

1766
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,880
I see Birdman back the
to what were we just say,

1767
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,330
man,

1768
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,170
what were we just saying?

1769
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:48,280
Oh,

1770
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,340
we're talking about
chicks with dicks and the

1771
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,520
cut it off.

1772
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:53,880
No,

1773
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,650
keep it.

1774
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,540
Keep the fun.

1775
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:55,940
Yeah,

1776
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,220
I mix it up.

1777
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,630
It's plenty of dudes will suck it.

1778
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,493
You know what I mean?

1779
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,131
Probably.

1780
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:00,890
Yeah.

1781
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:01,780
That's probably a big number.

1782
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:02,643
Go to Germany.

1783
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,531
You go to Germany,

1784
00:48:04,531 --> 00:48:05,590
he west Hollywood up the street.

1785
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,640
But the question is like,

1786
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:10,420
do they get suicidal because
they're not accepted early in life?

1787
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,530
I think the real question,

1788
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:13,690
because this is what a
lot of the thought is,

1789
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,830
is that they develop their self esteem
when they're very young and went there,

1790
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:21,820
you very young and they're a boy and
they wish they were a girl and then they

1791
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:24,700
get picked on for that or
they get fucked with for that.

1792
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,890
That becomes like this very,

1793
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:27,763
um,

1794
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:32,910
very awful connection with this terrible
memory in this terrible feeling that

1795
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:34,860
you feel around people who,

1796
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,250
who hate you just because you're
different and then you are as an adult.

1797
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:39,550
Yeah.

1798
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,070
And then who knows what
else comes into play there.

1799
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:42,904
Right.

1800
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,450
Um,

1801
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:43,720
you know,

1802
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,330
alcohol and but also hate
crimes on transgenders through.

1803
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,140
Yeah.

1804
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,580
Yeah.

1805
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,090
Like even,

1806
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:49,610
uh,

1807
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,320
uh,

1808
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,290
Kristin Beck who was a
former navy seal and now she,

1809
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:53,740
you know,

1810
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,640
she's a woman.

1811
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:55,474
She takes hormones,

1812
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,280
but I don't think chopper Dickoff off.

1813
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,510
You're talking about a navy seal killed.

1814
00:48:58,530 --> 00:48:58,810
Yeah.

1815
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,920
Ton Of fucking people.

1816
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,550
She was saying she was walking on the
street and some guys came up behind her,

1817
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:06,590
hit her over the head with a
bottle just for being transgender.

1818
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:08,020
I just knocked her out on the street.

1819
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:08,854
Jesus Christ.

1820
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,970
Fucking terrible man.

1821
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:11,703
Yeah.

1822
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,750
Yeah man,

1823
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,583
this is,

1824
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,110
it's just a lot of people that are
developed in a really fucked up way.

1825
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,540
You know,

1826
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,480
they've just seen too many awful things.

1827
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,930
He childhood and think about all these,

1828
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,230
all the people in this country right
now that are growing up in horrible

1829
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:33,290
neighborhoods and what's
going to happen out of them?

1830
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:33,870
What is,

1831
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:34,520
what's going to happen?

1832
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,211
What's going to happen?

1833
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:35,710
These people,

1834
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:39,620
you read these stories about Chicago
and parts of the south side Chicago with

1835
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,200
just shootings like a
hundred and a weekend.

1836
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,430
That kind of crazy shit,

1837
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,953
you know?

1838
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,320
Yeah.

1839
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,300
If you lived in a place like that,

1840
00:49:47,301 --> 00:49:48,134
like someone was,

1841
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,240
there was a comic who
said something I forgot.

1842
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:51,260
I apologize.

1843
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:52,490
I forgot who it was.

1844
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,720
Who said something like this
on Twitter about how you get,

1845
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,583
uh,

1846
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,760
he's a black comic too.

1847
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,940
You were saying that PTSD
is not just for soldiers.

1848
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,920
Like you get it when
you grow up in the hood.

1849
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,251
Oh,

1850
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:04,851
that makes sense.

1851
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:06,800
You see a lot of shit that you shouldn't,

1852
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,440
you shouldn't see your route.

1853
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:13,280
A lot of violence around a
lot of [inaudible] with a
different perspective when

1854
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:14,001
you grow up,

1855
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:17,510
a little shell shocked and um,

1856
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,383
I mean that's,

1857
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,480
that's a crazy way to develop,

1858
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:24,931
you know,

1859
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:25,764
super crazy.

1860
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,700
Well thank God for these
pills that you could take.

1861
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,630
Oh,

1862
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,100
I don't know if those are the
answer or there aren't they,

1863
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,210
but are they the answer for
some people sometime I think.

1864
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:35,660
Yeah.

1865
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:35,930
Yeah.

1866
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:36,201
Some,

1867
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:36,391
yeah.

1868
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:40,970
Some people were on hanging on by a thread
there hanging out on by a thread and

1869
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:45,390
someone comes along and they offer
them chemical escape from the,

1870
00:50:45,391 --> 00:50:48,650
the just the fucking sheer
misery of being alive.

1871
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,440
And then it puts them in a place
where they can think about things,

1872
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,400
does it,

1873
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,240
where they can think about it.

1874
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:55,880
Cause when you hear
like a Neil Brennan or,

1875
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:59,450
but Neal Brennan was fucking most
brilliant comedian minds out there.

1876
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,980
I wrote for a Chappelle show.

1877
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,960
Brilliant comic has special on Netflix,

1878
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:04,550
three mikes brilliant.

1879
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,800
And he talks about how,

1880
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,031
you know,

1881
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,020
when he takes those,

1882
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,010
those pills,

1883
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:12,920
the prescriptions every
like he doesn't get high,

1884
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,460
didn't get low.

1885
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,150
It's just,

1886
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,983
he's going through it.

1887
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,090
Like you talked about his accomplishments.

1888
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:17,361
He's like,

1889
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:17,481
yeah,

1890
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:18,314
it does nothing.

1891
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,730
Like I don't feel anything.

1892
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,710
They don't feel anything man.

1893
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:22,941
That's terrible,

1894
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:23,690
weird way to go.

1895
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,250
Well do you know depression again?

1896
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:25,470
Like,

1897
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,260
like what we were talking about earlier,

1898
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:27,770
it's,

1899
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:28,730
it's on a spectrum,

1900
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,110
just like mental illness,

1901
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:33,740
just like all kinds of other different
things that occur in people because

1902
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,030
everyone deals with depression.

1903
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,240
We've all been little Preston,

1904
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:38,820
but some people it sticks
like you can't get out of it.

1905
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,980
And Anti conspiracy theory
pill when you get take a blue,

1906
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,880
the blue pill,

1907
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,990
like on the weekends you don't want
to hit up out false flags or nothing.

1908
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,990
He does go out and just have fun and dude,

1909
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,450
Arusha footjoy the marsh fee are used.

1910
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,130
This is why I have its opinion on this.

1911
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,370
You should fear used
antidepressants correctly.

1912
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,690
And um,

1913
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,071
he,

1914
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:03,500
he had to try a couple of different kinds
and figure out which one really worked

1915
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:04,310
for him.

1916
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,170
But once he did it helped him.

1917
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,030
I saw it help and he's a happy guy.

1918
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,070
He turned his life around.

1919
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:10,830
He see,

1920
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,380
he got on the antidepressants and knees.

1921
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,660
He talks about this openly.

1922
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,070
Never share too though.

1923
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:16,460
Right?

1924
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,370
He got successful.

1925
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:18,500
It helps as well.

1926
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:19,070
He's still on him.

1927
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,330
But who knows what came first?

1928
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:21,200
The chicken or the egg?

1929
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:21,561
No,

1930
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,730
he weaned himself off of them.

1931
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,790
But he got on them and they helped him.

1932
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,400
And why did he have to wean
himself off as the health?

1933
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,940
Because he didn't think
that he needed him anymore.

1934
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,060
He thought that he was leaning on them
as a crutch and he would kind of reset

1935
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:37,520
his mind and change your way of thinking.

1936
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,180
Yeah.

1937
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:38,721
And He,

1938
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:38,901
you know,

1939
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:39,060
he,

1940
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,400
he and I talked about it and I'm,

1941
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:40,681
I'm,

1942
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:41,514
I'm,

1943
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,930
I'm trying to remember
exactly how he put it,

1944
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:46,550
but essentially it was what he was saying.

1945
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,320
I got another one to be
some limit that the Olympia,

1946
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:48,960
you gotta taste.

1947
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,220
Yes.

1948
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,770
Olympia Shit.

1949
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,100
It's delicious.

1950
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,280
Just something about beer in a can.

1951
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,001
I don't know what it is.

1952
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:56,151
My,

1953
00:52:56,151 --> 00:53:00,680
my mouth was watering like
a crack head beer in a can.

1954
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:02,060
Yeah.

1955
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:02,591
But with art,

1956
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,250
it's like success to make you happy.

1957
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:04,601
Like I,

1958
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:05,000
yeah,

1959
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,430
for sure.

1960
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:06,010
That man,

1961
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:06,920
he's killing it.

1962
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,521
He's killing it.

1963
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,290
And I'm sure that had
something to do with it.

1964
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,910
So maybe you get on it discounted.

1965
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,300
But I think there's a
lot of things going on.

1966
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,243
The depression,

1967
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,580
a lot of the things you can't,

1968
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:21,790
it's hard to narrow things down plus or
minus and thinking that it's one thing

1969
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:25,380
that's causing you to be happy or
one thing that's caused db to be sad.

1970
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,190
It's

1971
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,350
very likely there's a bunch
of different shit going on.

1972
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:29,581
Yeah,

1973
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,000
you gotta,

1974
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,750
you gotta remind yourself
every day of how lucky you are.

1975
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,901
Yeah.

1976
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:34,450
It's tough.

1977
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,100
That's tough.

1978
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,930
Fucking Thomas on realistic.

1979
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,280
Not really.

1980
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,851
Not really.

1981
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:39,684
You could do it.

1982
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,940
It's just like working out.

1983
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,720
You know what I mean?

1984
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,441
It's the same thing.

1985
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:45,630
You could put yourself an hour,

1986
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,770
hour and a half thinking one way.

1987
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:47,610
I'm going to work out.

1988
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,030
I'm going to,

1989
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm going to fucking focus on,

1990
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,110
on getting stronger today.

1991
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:54,510
Focus on the reps and all
the sets and my routine.

1992
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,940
You'll apply that to,

1993
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:57,181
you know,

1994
00:53:57,181 --> 00:53:58,230
just for 15 minutes.

1995
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:00,960
Just think about all the
shit you've accomplished.

1996
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,010
Think about the money.

1997
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:06,870
Have think about how lucky you are that
you don't live in fucking Liberia or

1998
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:08,610
Guatemala or some shit.

1999
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,580
You could be in that caravan right
now with the backpack throwing rocks.

2000
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,330
You know what I mean?

2001
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,021
So if you,

2002
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:13,681
if you really,

2003
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:14,011
and this is,

2004
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:15,000
that's the real shit though.

2005
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,950
That's not an illusion.

2006
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,920
The real shit is that
you should be thankful.

2007
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,560
The fake shit is not being thankful.

2008
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:23,394
That's the fake shit.

2009
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,090
That's,

2010
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,190
that's the illusion.

2011
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,410
It's not because you're so caught
up in like your daily life,

2012
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:28,951
stuff like that.

2013
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:29,581
But you know what I mean?

2014
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:33,390
You know how quickly you would appreciate
your life if you got framed for murder

2015
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:33,751
right now.

2016
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:36,090
Just right now all of a
sudden your knife would be,

2017
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:41,160
I had a little bit of a scare with my son
and it was like nothing else mattered.

2018
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:41,551
Yes,

2019
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:42,360
exactly.

2020
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:42,811
That happened.

2021
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:43,200
I was like,

2022
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,980
Dad,

2023
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,330
take my career to take this.

2024
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:45,691
Perfect.

2025
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:46,201
Exactly.

2026
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:47,480
Importunate would it be want man,

2027
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,820
just make him make it.

2028
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:49,621
I was like,

2029
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:51,030
maybe you have a verbal portion for real.

2030
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:51,721
I'm like,

2031
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,920
please make sure he's okay.

2032
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,600
I don't give a shit.

2033
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,610
Yeah.

2034
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:55,470
Damn.

2035
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,250
That's course like if you found out
you had five minutes to leave to live,

2036
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,620
all you would think about is your kid.

2037
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,540
That's all you would think about it.

2038
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:04,830
Well I just got evacuated,

2039
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,520
evacuated from my house
cause the fires fires,

2040
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,410
they're everywhere.

2041
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,833
They're everywhere.

2042
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:13,710
They're,

2043
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:14,461
they're in.

2044
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:14,790
Um,

2045
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:19,560
they ended evacuated like thousand oaks
and they evacuated places in Westlake

2046
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,300
and cigarettes out.

2047
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,200
Apparently this fire that we have here
is nothing in comparison to the fire

2048
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:26,190
that's in upstate.

2049
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,260
What further up northern?

2050
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:31,080
The northern California fires
supposed to be even more severe.

2051
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,840
They were saying that northern
California fire was moving it.

2052
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,970
What was the number of something insane?

2053
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:37,890
Like 80 football fields a minute.

2054
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,780
Wasn't that what every label it?

2055
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:41,460
The biggest fire California ever.

2056
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,460
The biggest fire going on right now
in northern California to northern

2057
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:45,060
California.

2058
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:50,010
It's craziest as a how damaged
cars are getting there.

2059
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,630
Like melt at cars are melted.

2060
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,890
This bus,

2061
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,030
this bus that looked like it was bombed.

2062
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:57,864
Like how was,

2063
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,120
how were fired?

2064
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:00,270
We know how it's done in that.

2065
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:00,851
I don't know.

2066
00:56:00,851 --> 00:56:03,960
It's always the worst when it's like
some fucking asshole started it.

2067
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:04,830
I don't know.

2068
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,670
I don't know if they know.

2069
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:06,510
Crikey.

2070
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,460
I don't know if they know
direct energy weapons.

2071
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:12,210
It happened right
outside of a rocket dyne.

2072
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,490
That's where it happened,

2073
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,743
which is a,

2074
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,010
it's like a rocket.

2075
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,620
Have you seen those pictures
of the cars with their,

2076
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,570
the rims are melting.

2077
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,130
How hot do forest fires get?

2078
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,180
They get hot as fuck.

2079
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,050
How is steel mill out of aluminum?

2080
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,460
It's a lot of aluminum wheels.

2081
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,990
The frame doesn't show
just so goddamn blurb.

2082
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:34,781
Aluminum wheels,

2083
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:35,540
right?

2084
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,060
Yeah.

2085
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,700
Halloween.

2086
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,860
Regular fire melts aluminum.

2087
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,490
I'm just a regular fire will melt.

2088
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,290
Your tires are going to let you know me,

2089
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:44,501
dude.

2090
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,334
You're asking me.

2091
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,030
You're asking me do I think about
who you're talking to right now?

2092
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,650
You got a couple of factors here
that I would just take into account.

2093
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,890
Not being a fire expert,

2094
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,120
but one of them want to think it would be.

2095
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:55,930
Tires.

2096
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,370
Tires are super flammable.

2097
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,780
Once your tires catch fire,

2098
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:02,110
they're all made out of rubber and
all kinds of other plastics and shit.

2099
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,400
Just fucking Flambeau.

2100
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:08,320
They go black smoke.

2101
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:09,490
It's a crazy smoke.

2102
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,250
That's why the cartel used and when
they kill people that put them into the

2103
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,273
fucking

2104
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:14,491
Dow.

2105
00:57:14,491 --> 00:57:16,900
Some with like lighter
fluid and I don't know.

2106
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,550
The other thing I was going to say is
gasoline cars are fueled by gasoline.

2107
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,800
Gasoline there you got fire,

2108
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,360
you got insane heat.

2109
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,600
The whole car gets in golf,

2110
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,050
the gas tank erupts.

2111
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,020
You got fucking
temperatures that are like,

2112
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:34,450
it's like basically having
an inferno right there.

2113
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,284
It's not like,

2114
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,210
it's not a fire like oh a fucking phone
book caught on fire and it melted a

2115
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:40,750
wheel.

2116
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,081
No,

2117
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:46,081
it's like a giant combustion engine that
works on gasoline and has these rubber

2118
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:52,960
stopper flammable tires and it's covered
by a plastic paint that's probably

2119
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:53,870
slammed Hobos,

2120
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,860
flammable and this shit all gets hit.

2121
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,880
Insides of leather with fire that's
coming from 50 mile an hour wind and fire

2122
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,741
machines.

2123
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:05,020
And then about like the the registration.

2124
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,730
What the fuck?

2125
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,200
I mean I'm just trying to be funny.

2126
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:11,170
Oh I'm sorry.

2127
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,063
I thought you were serious.

2128
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,030
Look at these cars.

2129
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,740
These cars got murked.

2130
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,280
This is like what happened when
I met Loki on the Avengers.

2131
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,210
They fucking destroyed Eddie.

2132
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,830
That the heat makes them shatter.

2133
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,060
They fall apart.

2134
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,550
If you ever get a glass too hot,

2135
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,000
you ever have a glass get too hot?

2136
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:32,830
No.

2137
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,110
If you pour tea in a regular glass,

2138
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:35,944
they crack.

2139
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:41,850
So that's not even that hot cause
it team makes them expand the,

2140
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:42,201
the,

2141
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:43,270
the heat from the T.

2142
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,440
You're not buying it Hoodie.

2143
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,640
I Dunno man.

2144
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:46,790
Well it was fires aware.

2145
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,820
This is what I would suggest.

2146
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:48,670
Don't look into it.

2147
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,570
Try Shit.

2148
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,760
You know me affected by the fires.

2149
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,653
Fires.

2150
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:56,381
If CNN,

2151
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:58,780
if the headline says anything,

2152
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,711
I don't believe it.

2153
00:58:59,711 --> 00:58:59,930
Any,

2154
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:00,763
anything.

2155
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,560
That's true Eddie.

2156
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:03,250
That's true.

2157
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,810
Here's the beautiful
thing about this fire.

2158
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:05,800
You can fucking see it.

2159
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,080
You don't have to one on another fire.

2160
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:09,640
I'm just saying like how it started.

2161
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:10,600
This is what we're talking about.

2162
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:11,620
We're talking about this fire.

2163
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,330
There's a fire for sure.

2164
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,530
Giant by the smoke.

2165
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,690
So I don't know.

2166
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,690
There's some crazy people
out there saying that um,

2167
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,260
being started by some fucking
direct energy weapons.

2168
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:24,891
Adol no,

2169
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:26,420
that's what the crazy people are saying.

2170
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:26,540
Well,

2171
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,800
fires happen all the time though.

2172
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,240
It's kind of a natural,

2173
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,110
what's more likely that
fires are happening.

2174
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:38,140
Like they always fucking happen from
electric boxes going out or wires going

2175
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:41,540
down or people being
assholes with cigarettes.

2176
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,380
That's how firefight before
there was Illuminati,

2177
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,000
before there was anything,

2178
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,260
there was forest fires.

2179
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,340
They had been around forever.

2180
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,720
This is not like a new occurrence.

2181
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:54,410
It's not like they using this secret
energy weapon to do some shit that's never

2182
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:55,250
been done before.

2183
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,170
How done when they're super energy weapon,

2184
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:58,250
if they use it to start fires,

2185
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,050
there's just a lot of weird
shit out there like that.

2186
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:01,670
Houses like you can see house,

2187
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:02,001
house,

2188
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:02,540
house,

2189
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,570
completely level all
the trees around them.

2190
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,880
Nothing wrong with the trees at all.

2191
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:08,580
Weird.

2192
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,710
Just weird shit like that.

2193
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,880
Well it's proud of knowing what these
are here for the fire to make fucking

2194
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:17,450
houses go up in flames
because it's all dry old shit.

2195
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,550
So dry wood hood,

2196
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,770
you got dry old shit on the tile,

2197
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,850
your tiles.

2198
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:24,890
A lot of times these people have these um,

2199
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,160
these roofing tiles in the
embers get in between there.

2200
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:29,450
It goes right into the tar.

2201
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:30,284
It burns it,

2202
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,740
it goes right through my next door
neighbor is his roof was on fire.

2203
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,510
[inaudible]

2204
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,030
done well.

2205
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:37,650
Yeah.

2206
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:37,851
No,

2207
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:38,570
they um,

2208
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:38,870
they,

2209
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,310
they got to it in time.

2210
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:41,630
The firefighters caught it.

2211
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,220
Actually my friend bud caught it,

2212
01:00:43,221 --> 01:00:44,850
told the firefighters to bud.

2213
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,100
Bud Brotzmann.

2214
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,430
Yeah.

2215
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:47,200
His house.

2216
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,351
No,

2217
01:00:47,351 --> 01:00:47,460
no,

2218
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:47,570
no.

2219
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:48,403
It wasn't his house,

2220
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,420
but it was my neighbor's house.

2221
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,380
So when,

2222
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,820
when this was all going down,

2223
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,860
this is happening all throughout,

2224
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:55,671
not just here,

2225
01:00:55,671 --> 01:01:00,671
but all throughout Topanga now and Malibu
and these embers fall from the sky and

2226
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,450
then they blew the light.

2227
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:05,060
Everything up in flames
because everywhere you look,

2228
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,910
everything is dry as fuck.

2229
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,340
Shit,

2230
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,920
we haven't had any rain
in a long ass time.

2231
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,780
If you go running in the trails,

2232
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:12,830
it's just dust.

2233
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,970
You're kicking up dust,

2234
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:17,880
you start calling and
you got the wins breads,

2235
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:18,590
all of it.

2236
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,060
Everything's Brown and dried entity.

2237
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,110
And when these embers fall
from the sky and hit this shit,

2238
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,160
it just starts up.

2239
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,060
We're just lucky.

2240
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:27,080
It doesn't happen more often.

2241
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:27,914
In fact though,

2242
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,750
it happened this time last year
around here because we had a deal,

2243
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,600
we had ash out in the gym area.

2244
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:40,070
We had a sweep the ash out cause he had
actually come in through cracks like

2245
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,040
little tiny cracks.

2246
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:41,480
I'm bash,

2247
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,660
although my house from his
fire all the way where I'm at,

2248
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,500
I'm sure,

2249
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,640
I'm sure it's no joke.

2250
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,180
Dude was two shifts IV.

2251
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:50,720
So I don't think it's an energy wave.

2252
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:56,030
But I do think it's fucking
super dangerous to live
in a climate where there's

2253
01:01:56,031 --> 01:01:59,330
this much vegetation
and not enough moisture.

2254
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,740
Like how come we can't figure out how to
get that fucking water out of the ocean

2255
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,990
and start spraying it all over
so much water and you know,

2256
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,940
it's just so much.

2257
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,180
There's salt in it.

2258
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,230
We can't fuck with it.

2259
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,170
The can't fuck with us all.

2260
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:17,120
Feel like they can take the salt down
until the can't fuck with the salt.

2261
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,391
No,

2262
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:17,451
no,

2263
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:17,601
no.

2264
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:18,680
They have desalination.

2265
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:20,070
Plants are just too expensive.

2266
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:20,911
That's too expensive.

2267
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:21,741
We can't afford that.

2268
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:23,210
They say this Guy Holman.

2269
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:24,031
In fact,

2270
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,070
if we only had more money
we'd be able to do that.

2271
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,600
But it's too expensive.

2272
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,990
The plants off the ocean water
now they use all our water.

2273
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,450
If you got rid of almonds in
California will be straight.

2274
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,333
Wow.

2275
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,490
The almonds bro.

2276
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,120
Vegans consumed more almonds
and then they were there.

2277
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:39,990
The reason why,

2278
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:40,840
the reason why the word.

2279
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,340
Imagine how ironic that would be is
there as almonds that we're doing this in

2280
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:45,174
the whole time,

2281
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,620
not cattle raising.

2282
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:52,130
Is fucking almond country rich enough
to filter the salt out of water and use

2283
01:02:53,431 --> 01:02:56,530
the water for their country or
is it just too expensive to buy?

2284
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,510
I could do that shit.

2285
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,490
No,

2286
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,830
I don't have that much money

2287
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:02,730
in a hotel.

2288
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,310
They would roll out a carpet,

2289
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:09,320
made a goal to do it slide and a
gold surfboard in that fucking song.

2290
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:10,933
Builders,

2291
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,810
like for the navy there's like a
survivor filter that you could drink the

2292
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,600
seawater and you could like
suck and it's like this filter,

2293
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,600
the survival thing.

2294
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,770
I don't know about that.

2295
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,060
I know they have been drink piss,

2296
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,790
so they have those things for ponds,

2297
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,790
they have these things
they're called steri pants.

2298
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,280
Just can't figure out that seawater
and this cannot go that out.

2299
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,830
What's a high salt content?

2300
01:03:30,831 --> 01:03:31,630
You too expensive.

2301
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:33,120
Can't have that much salt content.

2302
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,793
What if?

2303
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,770
What if we have a water tax?

2304
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,461
You know what I mean?

2305
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:39,660
We're running out of water.

2306
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,470
We got to figure out how to take
the salt out of the seawater.

2307
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,840
I don't think this is a,

2308
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:45,870
we have a task.

2309
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,310
Plenty of fresh water though.

2310
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:48,810
I don't think this is a conspiracy.

2311
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,081
No.

2312
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:49,914
You just said,

2313
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:53,580
you just said how come we can't just take
the fucking ocean water and I was just

2314
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:54,414
being funny.

2315
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:55,590
I'll tell you why they can't.

2316
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:56,970
It's fucking super expensive.

2317
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:57,361
It's too,

2318
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:58,770
it's just be a transplant.

2319
01:03:59,030 --> 01:03:59,863
Yeah.

2320
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:05,470
Well kind of much money to change the
water and to do it all the time for all

2321
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,083
the people.

2322
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,330
Just pull that water out
and then who owns it?

2323
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,480
Maybe if we bring some coke and from
Central America and generate income that

2324
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:15,000
way.

2325
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,610
Imagine if we started sucking
all the stuff out of the ocean.

2326
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:20,970
The ocean started pushing back and then
people started building houses in front

2327
01:04:20,971 --> 01:04:22,290
of the people's houses in Malibu.

2328
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,530
And at first they would,

2329
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,320
at first they would go,

2330
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:26,070
fuck you.

2331
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:26,910
We have the beach.

2332
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,211
Yeah,

2333
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:27,371
yeah,

2334
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:27,541
yeah.

2335
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,710
But it's not the beach anymore.

2336
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,120
So basically just got an acre

2337
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,600
because I've read a book a mile,

2338
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:35,040
just keep sucking water out.

2339
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,110
Imagine this like a mile to the beach now.

2340
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:37,561
And uh,

2341
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:37,930
you know,

2342
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:38,910
all these Malveaux people,

2343
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,740
they show up at the fucking
county board meetings,

2344
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,990
pulling the water out of the ocean.

2345
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,070
He turned around behind him.

2346
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:45,690
It's a goddamn tropical jungle.

2347
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,600
We got monkeys in La and parents and shit.

2348
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,113
Man.

2349
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:54,030
We turned it into the tropics
when make it moist and delicious,

2350
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:58,020
that that would happen is a
piece I'm gonna do a fight.

2351
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,470
Uh,

2352
01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,490
real quick dairy.

2353
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:00,230
She's a monster.

2354
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,390
Yeah,

2355
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,170
he is a beast.

2356
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:01,740
He's just fell,

2357
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,000
fallen on hard times a little bit.

2358
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:04,860
He was ranked fucking high for a while.

2359
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:05,910
He's a very good fighter.

2360
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:06,331
Yeah.

2361
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:07,440
He's so good at everything,

2362
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:07,630
man.

2363
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:08,470
And just very good.

2364
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,920
Matchups he had a tough loss,

2365
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:11,131
right?

2366
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:11,964
His last fight.

2367
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:13,860
He follows up to Martin.

2368
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:14,694
Stopped him.

2369
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,130
Michael Johnson recently,

2370
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,160
but I forget it was Amy.

2371
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:20,140
Can you pull up and
Neil Dahrouge she's um,

2372
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,120
he had a tough flat on the ground.

2373
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,691
Amazing.

2374
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:24,370
Fucking striking.

2375
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:26,860
I do not know much about this.

2376
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:28,770
Saw fighting.

2377
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,280
Say his name.

2378
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:31,114
Moisis

2379
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:32,501
oh.

2380
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:32,951
Tiyaga.

2381
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:34,390
Moisis these from att.

2382
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,590
He fought an Ebi combat Jujitsu.

2383
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:36,791
Oh,

2384
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,400
no shit.

2385
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:37,610
Oh,

2386
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:38,443
how good is he?

2387
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,120
Uh,

2388
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,830
it was hard to tell from one match,

2389
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,270
but he's a black belt.

2390
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,590
He's from American top team,

2391
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:46,360
so he's gotta be a fucking beast.

2392
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,130
The daddy jumped right in to kill it.

2393
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,070
To eat.

2394
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,540
That's a deep one.

2395
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,110
Like,

2396
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,750
Oh shit.

2397
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,250
That we shouldn't be prompt to summit.

2398
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,180
Wow.

2399
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,080
That was tight though.

2400
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,010
She has,

2401
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,690
he got killed by Edson Barboza.

2402
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:02,610
That's what we're thinking about.

2403
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:02,921
Yeah,

2404
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,110
that's exactly one thing
about by a flying knee.

2405
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:08,860
And then Alexander Hernandez in his
last fight Caledon with punches,

2406
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:09,970
but he's beat some good guys.

2407
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:10,670
Like James is.

2408
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:14,260
He knocked down that Tiago Moises,

2409
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,030
he's gone for us going for it.

2410
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,560
Fucking tough to submit him.

2411
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,611
It's going to be,

2412
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:19,241
but man,

2413
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:19,781
he uh,

2414
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:20,571
I think he has it.

2415
01:06:20,571 --> 01:06:21,910
Took his back and strangle them.

2416
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:22,410
Yeah.

2417
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,700
Did we do I love chess at 70 yeah,

2418
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:25,060
he did.

2419
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:25,391
He did,

2420
01:06:25,391 --> 01:06:25,870
right?

2421
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:26,320
Yeah.

2422
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:26,511
She,

2423
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:27,101
I said seven.

2424
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:27,461
I do like,

2425
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:28,294
can we trouble,

2426
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,940
he just was killing himself.

2427
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,430
Makes you pay 85 yeah.

2428
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,850
I love from hanging around him.

2429
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,460
He's a wide fella.

2430
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,600
He's a sturdy fellow.

2431
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:38,111
Big Dude.

2432
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:38,680
Big Frame.

2433
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,150
He's me really good at 70.

2434
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:40,311
He's,

2435
01:06:40,311 --> 01:06:41,260
he can give guys problems.

2436
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:41,530
You know,

2437
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:41,800
were,

2438
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,630
I was doing commentary with Paul Felder,

2439
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,200
you know,

2440
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,790
and I'm standing next to Paul Felder.

2441
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,151
I'm thinking,

2442
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:47,320
how the fuck are you?

2443
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:48,700
155 pounds.

2444
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,200
That is ridiculous.

2445
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:52,260
You're not 155 he gets bad to it.

2446
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:52,930
People say,

2447
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:53,231
you know,

2448
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:53,891
this guy over here,

2449
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:54,631
he's 200 pounds with,

2450
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:55,330
Hey,

2451
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,280
I was one 92 last two,

2452
01:06:57,281 --> 01:06:57,881
my bad.

2453
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:58,690
He'll get upset.

2454
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,523
That's hilarious.

2455
01:06:59,560 --> 01:06:59,951
He'll give you,

2456
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:02,830
try to gain an extra
eight or 10 pounds on him.

2457
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,270
He's just a big lightweight.

2458
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:04,990
He's a big boy.

2459
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,450
He's a powerhouse in thinking about it.

2460
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:08,920
That was my Perry's last fight.

2461
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:10,990
Last when my Perry can outclassed him.

2462
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:11,381
Well,

2463
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:12,400
what happened was,

2464
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,293
um,

2465
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,950
he bounced his forearm off of Mike Perez
head early on in the fight and he's

2466
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:22,360
spinning back fist at him and hit him
with this part of the forearm right in the

2467
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:24,640
forehead and snapped his
arm and half his arm.

2468
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,580
So he's fighting with one arm and
fought like that for three rounds,

2469
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:28,720
but he couldn't wrestle.

2470
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:29,261
Okay.

2471
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:30,160
So he couldn't shoot,

2472
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:31,930
take downs or do anything
with his right arm.

2473
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,820
He punched him with it a bunch of times,

2474
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:35,050
even though it's still broken.

2475
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,130
And he was trying,

2476
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:38,260
he was trying to punch with
his leg was in fucking agony.

2477
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,520
It's not just about power,

2478
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:39,970
right?

2479
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:43,150
It's about knowing that this shit doesn't
work anymore and you're going to try

2480
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:43,984
to grab her hand.

2481
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,550
And he got a guy tried
to rip your head off.

2482
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,413
And Mike Perry,

2483
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,770
super strong,

2484
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:48,401
one 70.

2485
01:07:48,401 --> 01:07:49,270
He's a beast.

2486
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:50,500
He's super aggressive.

2487
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,270
He comes at you real hard.

2488
01:07:52,271 --> 01:07:54,400
He takes a tremendous shot.

2489
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:58,480
He's got a fucking Iron Chin
and horrifying knockout power.

2490
01:07:58,481 --> 01:08:00,490
Tough matchup for Jake Kellenberger Elbow,

2491
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:01,031
that elbow.

2492
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:02,740
Kayla lucky like Jesus,

2493
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,880
he's got real power but then
you know the guillotine.

2494
01:08:06,881 --> 01:08:10,600
But Paul Filter was kind of Mike Page
first wind where he's technical and stayed

2495
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:12,310
on the outside hanging on that neck.

2496
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:12,790
Yeah.

2497
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,200
And then before that though,

2498
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:16,840
like Alan Jobe and beat
him was super technical.

2499
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:18,860
I think the move to Jackson's has,

2500
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:22,760
it had a giant impact on him because
what I saw in his last fight,

2501
01:08:22,761 --> 01:08:25,940
I saw him manage distance
much better and pace.

2502
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,660
He wasn't just like a marauding
psycho going after her own fate.

2503
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:30,511
He's mixing it up.

2504
01:08:30,511 --> 01:08:31,700
You ain't go sit it up.

2505
01:08:31,701 --> 01:08:33,740
It was like very good footwork as well.

2506
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,000
It was very technical.

2507
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:39,500
So I think he's adding a lot
more technique and strategy
to what he already had.

2508
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:40,550
The Tower series,

2509
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:41,680
power series,

2510
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,800
aggression can,

2511
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,180
he had skills already.

2512
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,470
It's not like you couldn't punch,

2513
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:46,304
it's not like he couldn't,

2514
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:46,670
you know,

2515
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:48,530
but he was kind of one
dimensional a little bit.

2516
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,760
We'll just so wild,

2517
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:51,410
so reckless and so,

2518
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,120
so hungry to fuck you.

2519
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:55,400
What will beat a lot of
guys to get a certain level,

2520
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,450
then they can deal with it.

2521
01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:00,590
But Kudos to him for recognizing Brilla
and then making some adjustments.

2522
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:03,200
And I think he definitely did make
an adjustment in that Felder fight.

2523
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,011
He looked amazing.

2524
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:05,450
So it was on him.

2525
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:06,530
He made the adjustment.

2526
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:07,100
Um,

2527
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,650
and he obviously put in
the work and look great.

2528
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:14,090
And it was also on Felder breaking his
arm or pretty early on the fine arm.

2529
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,800
But even before he broke his arm,

2530
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,720
Perry was getting the
better of the exchanges.

2531
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:18,051
He was,

2532
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:19,310
he was more dangerous.

2533
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,153
He was like,

2534
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,740
there was more consequences.

2535
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:21,840
He,

2536
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,220
he's a,

2537
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:27,220
he's a fucking scary knockout artists
stylistic wise for cowboy hits a tough

2538
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:28,244
five days.

2539
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:28,760
Well,

2540
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,760
we both think that cowboys at
his best when he doesn't have to,

2541
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,980
he doesn't have to fight guys that
are that much bigger than him.

2542
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:37,730
You know,

2543
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:40,250
I would rather see some
guy's tough cowboy.

2544
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:44,750
I'd rather see him at one 55 then
see him fight Darren till again.

2545
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:48,200
There was something about seeing him
with Darren till we see how big Darren is

2546
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:48,981
at one 70.

2547
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,480
He's fucking big man.

2548
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,531
He's big.

2549
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:53,520
He even talked about going to 85 and he,

2550
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:54,620
he's going 85 now.

2551
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,990
And you look at him [inaudible]
he changed his mind again.

2552
01:09:57,991 --> 01:09:58,130
Yeah,

2553
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:58,650
he's like a thing.

2554
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:00,140
It would collect 70
cause he was gonna fight.

2555
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:03,350
Ask Her in at 70 them they
gave African Robbie Lawler.

2556
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,393
Oh,

2557
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:04,941
what?

2558
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:05,900
Both fights I love.

2559
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,270
But you know that guy's just so,

2560
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,980
he was so much bigger than cowboy.

2561
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:11,420
He was so much bigger.

2562
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:12,980
Way bigger when you
looked at him in there.

2563
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:15,140
I mean he looked like he was
two weight classes bigger.

2564
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:16,340
At least one weight class.

2565
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:17,174
Bigger look at ease.

2566
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,220
At least on the upper end
of the next weight class.

2567
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,180
Lawler makes sense.

2568
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:21,014
What are you talking about?

2569
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:21,410
Fuck yeah,

2570
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:22,880
the reasons to not make sense.

2571
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:23,960
It may make sense.

2572
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:24,381
No,

2573
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:27,570
it doesn't get to be hard to take down
and he's fucking vicious with this.

2574
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,650
So none on the night of the fight.

2575
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,513
I dig it.

2576
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:34,790
But the thing that makes Ben
aspirins special to is his,

2577
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:35,690
you know his mouth,

2578
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:36,291
his mind came.

2579
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:38,060
So rob not going to play that game.

2580
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:39,170
He doesn't have a dance partner.

2581
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:39,800
Oh,

2582
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,930
that's what makes it
great is that he can't,

2583
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,621
he can't.

2584
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:42,950
Uh,

2585
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:43,161
what?

2586
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:43,850
What is it going to do?

2587
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:47,260
This is the fashion lover and
you're talking none of them hold up.

2588
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:47,940
No.

2589
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:48,251
This,

2590
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:50,050
this is the Dana white me talking.

2591
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:50,930
This is the moneymaker.

2592
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:52,910
Meet the your boys the exact same way.

2593
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:56,930
Let me here because if you give Ben
Astron who can talk fucking right up there

2594
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:57,411
with the best,

2595
01:10:57,411 --> 01:10:58,244
we got men.

2596
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,450
If you give him a guy,

2597
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,800
you know you name anybody,

2598
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,720
you give him with anyone in the,

2599
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:05,030
in the fight game and
he goes back and forth.

2600
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,511
He's going to be great.

2601
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,340
You can Colby Cummington
who's a shit talker.

2602
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:07,610
Yeah.

2603
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:10,710
The fans are going to be able to gravitate
towards that and see the story is

2604
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:11,540
that first fight.

2605
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,081
That's the first.

2606
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:13,100
This is only one fight.

2607
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,010
It's a big fight.

2608
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,360
Robbie lumpy physically that shit.

2609
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:18,980
Talking aside,

2610
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,580
you're right with the
shit talking for sure.

2611
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,533
X's and o's.

2612
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,440
Amazing fight night,

2613
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:23,340
but love the fight.

2614
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,770
The physicality of the fight.

2615
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:26,604
Is that a word?

2616
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:27,480
Probably.

2617
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,313
I like to work.

2618
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:28,741
I'll tell you.

2619
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:29,700
It's probably Jamie.

2620
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:30,800
You got her name right?

2621
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:31,860
Physicality.

2622
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,780
That's a word that seems right.

2623
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:34,951
Come on man.

2624
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:35,784
That's the,

2625
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,690
hold on.

2626
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:38,220
This is no easy for Ben.

2627
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:39,360
That's going to be a hard

2628
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,390
fight is easy for him.

2629
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,700
He just grabs everybody.

2630
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,130
Fucking Manhattan.

2631
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:46,700
I'm Sam for the Russian guys.

2632
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:49,860
Same to take full advantage of what
Ben Asker and brings to the table.

2633
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,040
Robbie Lawler is not the matchup
I would give them off the bat.

2634
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:53,501
I would.

2635
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:56,970
He gave him a Darren till or Colby come
into in something like that who will

2636
01:11:56,971 --> 01:11:57,960
verbally go back.

2637
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:01,410
Got To build up to that has
been in the game too long.

2638
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:03,180
I understand what the night of the fight.

2639
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,350
Amazing fight.

2640
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,190
I don't think.

2641
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,600
I think you just want to see the fight.

2642
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:10,750
I don't think we should ever
make decisions based on shit.

2643
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,461
Talking Shit,

2644
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:13,110
talking and encouraging shit talking.

2645
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:15,030
I think what's interesting
about Ben asked her in his bed,

2646
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:15,810
aspirin,

2647
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:19,590
I want to see what the fuck he can
do to a real former world champion.

2648
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:22,020
We're hardcore who's fought
at the highest level.

2649
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,093
That's a great,

2650
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:24,930
great match with you guys.

2651
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:25,610
I love them.

2652
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,780
I love Robbie lines.

2653
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,340
I think Robbie allows the
legend whether he talks back,

2654
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:30,330
no one's gonna give a shit.

2655
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:30,780
Look,

2656
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,261
Ben,

2657
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:32,220
ask him when he was at.

2658
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,300
That's not the world we live in.

2659
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:33,630
Joe,

2660
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:33,901
Ben,

2661
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,040
ask him when he was at the UFC,

2662
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:37,290
they put a camera on him
and the crowd went nuts.

2663
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,000
He hasn't even fought in the UFC yet.

2664
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,980
Everybody knows about
him from the Internet.

2665
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:45,150
A lot of people know about him from you
and me and a lot of people know about

2666
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:48,060
him from Bela Tarr fans and one fc fans.

2667
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:52,620
I think people didn't realize how fucking
popular he is and how people want to

2668
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:54,810
see what an undefeated,

2669
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:00,020
undefeated wrestler who dominated guys
like Lima and Koresh carve and Bella tour

2670
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,710
still hasn't dominated.

2671
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:02,100
I want,

2672
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,370
don't you want to see what the fuck that
guy can do and if you don't want to see

2673
01:13:05,371 --> 01:13:08,610
what that guy can do against
the fucking ruthless one.

2674
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,750
Robbie Lawler,

2675
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,460
Robbie Lawler's not done man.

2676
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:12,110
No,

2677
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:12,750
he's not done.

2678
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,930
He's still be lunches.

2679
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,360
He's alleged scary.

2680
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:16,530
He's always scary,

2681
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:17,140
man.

2682
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:17,380
Pete,

2683
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,940
he's had multiple like
periods in his career.

2684
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,650
He had the strike force period.

2685
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:22,951
Hey,

2686
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:24,350
the UFC period here,

2687
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,620
the championship period.

2688
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,041
You know,

2689
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:29,280
he had his younger wild days and
why he's fallen on some hard times.

2690
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,050
He's not the greatest.

2691
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:34,110
Robbie Lawler is not the
greatest wrestler of all time.

2692
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:39,170
He's fucking wrestle growing
up and what the equalizer are.

2693
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,560
His fucking hands,

2694
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:41,010
dude,

2695
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:41,580
his kicks,

2696
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,200
Russell was everything you could say.

2697
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:43,411
He's,

2698
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:43,860
you know,

2699
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,860
he's like right in there,

2700
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:45,360
you know,

2701
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,710
a decent wrestler,

2702
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,300
but it's fucking hands.

2703
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:53,410
Aspirin takes down and is anybody in the
UFC he made maybe pet he might finding

2704
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:56,980
out he was going to be as
entertaining as fuck dude.

2705
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,540
Again,

2706
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,580
I think it's coming at me like I
don't think he's a great fight.

2707
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,570
I'd love the fight.

2708
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,113
I just went,

2709
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:02,761
ah man,

2710
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:03,950
I'm gonna get him Colby Covington.

2711
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:04,770
I would have gave him,

2712
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:05,580
that's coming.

2713
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,413
That's coming.

2714
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,540
This is after the first time world champ.

2715
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,410
But or,

2716
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:13,780
or Robbie Lawler gets Cubby
Colby Covington if he wins.

2717
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,470
No,

2718
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:15,370
that's a great way to,

2719
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:16,780
for Robbie to get back into the mix.

2720
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:20,540
And plus you don't want to make it easy
on Ben Ashman cause everyone's goal.

2721
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:20,681
Yeah.

2722
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:21,580
This to,

2723
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,503
uh,

2724
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,180
out of the UFC organisation champ.

2725
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:25,961
Let's see what he's made of.

2726
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,460
Robbie Lawler is a tough fucking tests.

2727
01:14:27,461 --> 01:14:28,570
Good take down defense.

2728
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,500
But how can artists,

2729
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:34,210
it gives roc nation an opportunity
to reset to if Robbie can beat him.

2730
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:34,631
You know,

2731
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:37,090
Robbie didn't have a good
fight with Rafael dos Anjos,

2732
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:38,620
but he did have a good fight with cowboy.

2733
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:39,251
Right?

2734
01:14:39,251 --> 01:14:40,660
Those were the last two fights he had,

2735
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:41,350
I believe.

2736
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:42,190
Am I right about that?

2737
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,440
He lost dose on Jolson Cowboy.

2738
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,180
He lost the Dos Anjos right?

2739
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,640
Last raining.

2740
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:48,550
It's cowboy.

2741
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,580
Has Aspirin fought
anybody at Lawler's level?

2742
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:52,130
No.

2743
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:52,420
No.

2744
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:52,780
Right?

2745
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:53,520
No.

2746
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,250
Lima.

2747
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:54,920
Douglas Lema.

2748
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,960
But also younger Lima
didn't wrestle growing up.

2749
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,190
It was a younger Lima.

2750
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:02,680
So I met the same cops.

2751
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:03,550
A fucking monster.

2752
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,240
But he's,

2753
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,260
but both those guys,

2754
01:15:05,261 --> 01:15:06,220
he dominated them.

2755
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:07,210
So they were young.

2756
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,770
Lala brings in wrestling
and ferocious striking.

2757
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:14,620
Also can't competition
at the highest levels.

2758
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,290
Great champion in the UFC.

2759
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:17,711
I mean,

2760
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:19,450
he fought warriors.

2761
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,590
He fought some of the best,

2762
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:21,220
the vast,

2763
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:21,491
I mean,

2764
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:22,780
he's one of the best of best.

2765
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:27,810
I'm interested in shit
times canny can't add.

2766
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,880
Is there something about Lawler
that asked him can talk shit about,

2767
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:31,870
what?

2768
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,440
Can you say?

2769
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,273
Nothing.

2770
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,620
There's a few guys you
can't talk shit about.

2771
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:37,210
It's fricking Robbie Lawlor,

2772
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,620
Dan Henderson,

2773
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,610
Matt Hughes,

2774
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:41,290
like you just can't you remember Pete?

2775
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:41,950
There's nothing there.

2776
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,360
Before Tyron Woodley beat him,

2777
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:46,090
people thought he was the
boogie man who Robby Lauer.

2778
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,051
A huge scare.

2779
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:47,884
The shit out of people.

2780
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:52,950
I'll never forget Dana white at the comedy
store and like 2002 or three and he's

2781
01:15:53,201 --> 01:15:53,620
like,

2782
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:54,050
it needs,

2783
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:54,620
we're,

2784
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,880
we're at the parking lot.

2785
01:15:55,930 --> 01:16:00,190
Dana white went to see you and he's
like raving about this new kid.

2786
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:01,061
Oh my God,

2787
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:01,930
I got this new kid,

2788
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:03,460
Robbie Lawler's ferocious.

2789
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,700
He's a wrestler who's just knocking
everybody out on the local level.

2790
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:08,590
You're going to hear a
lot about Robbie Lawler.

2791
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:10,000
I'll never forget that.

2792
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,510
2001 2002 something like that.

2793
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:14,490
Talking about a hall of Famer,

2794
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:15,430
Legit Hall of Famer.

2795
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,090
Yeah,

2796
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:19,270
so for sure it's the toughest
opponent of Ben aspirins career or,

2797
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,170
yeah,

2798
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,070
I would say it's the toughest,

2799
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,230
but for sure it's a tough validates.

2800
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:23,501
Ben.

2801
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:24,250
If he beats them.

2802
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,360
I have to be totally honest.

2803
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:25,690
I never,

2804
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:27,670
I never watched his fights in one FC.

2805
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:29,810
I'd never figured out
Ben's with you get it off

2806
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:32,490
with the Russian wrestler.

2807
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,760
He does one guy.

2808
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:34,594
He's the best way.

2809
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,810
I mean I just saw,

2810
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,940
I just saw highlights.

2811
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:37,730
I saw highlights too.

2812
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:38,900
I didn't watch one FC either

2813
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:41,710
one.

2814
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,780
As soon as he puts his hands,

2815
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,510
autos is at something's up.

2816
01:16:46,511 --> 01:16:49,780
But he has bionic hands or something
because as soon as he's able to get his

2817
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:50,500
hands on,

2818
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,490
he just doesn't let go.

2819
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,410
And I'm not going to say names you down.

2820
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:54,490
I'm not gonna say names,

2821
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:55,383
but he does.

2822
01:16:56,170 --> 01:17:00,050
He does that to everybody and
guys we know that are good graph.

2823
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,540
I mean if free bud.

2824
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:01,721
Yeah,

2825
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:02,800
that's exactly what I hear.

2826
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,260
Which is why you and I both,

2827
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,870
we went on like a goddamn
campaign to get that motherfucker.

2828
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,100
How long did it take?

2829
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:11,571
I know.

2830
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:14,990
I love having him on the podcast was
great too because people could get to see

2831
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:16,040
who he actually is,

2832
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:16,461
you know,

2833
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:17,131
because you,

2834
01:17:17,131 --> 01:17:20,780
you want a guy like Matt Locke and
these little shit talk and blurbs.

2835
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,550
Like this guy an asshole.

2836
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:23,384
Like who is this guy?

2837
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,670
But then you sit with them
for an hour and he's fun.

2838
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,770
He's fucking smart as shit.

2839
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,600
Really well educated.

2840
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:31,670
Looks like a Greek statue,

2841
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:32,301
right?

2842
01:17:32,301 --> 01:17:33,230
Doesn't even get extra.

2843
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,710
He take a shot like no one man.

2844
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:40,070
He takes fucking knees when he
shoots and gets clipped with knees.

2845
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,300
Not good enough.

2846
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:42,650
The greatest spiders,

2847
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,220
there's,

2848
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:47,000
there's a couple others that you used
to used to campaign for the greatest

2849
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:48,650
fighters that never fought in the UFC.

2850
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:53,180
Ben Aspirin is one cause the other
one fader was a big black guy,

2851
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,380
a black guy,

2852
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:56,030
black guy who's never fought in the UFC.

2853
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:59,060
Not Sad campaign for for 10 fucking years.

2854
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:00,793
Man Home.

2855
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,010
Oh yeah.

2856
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:07,010
But it wasn't really fighting that
much MMA outside of pride rules.

2857
01:18:07,401 --> 01:18:07,910
Right?

2858
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:08,340
Like he did.

2859
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,440
Did he fought anywhere else?

2860
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,800
He taught Bella toy data.

2861
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,440
Fucking knock you into another dimension
or he's going to get choked out,

2862
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,170
but either way you bring them
in his fight with Robbie Lawler.

2863
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,730
How can we never got Melvin into
the you because you want an a man.

2864
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,793
Is that what it was?

2865
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,470
Once you suggest the fiber,

2866
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:28,601
they're never coming.

2867
01:18:28,601 --> 01:18:29,970
Now you guys got it bro.

2868
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:31,870
It's different hymns,

2869
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:33,780
different name of fucking move.

2870
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:34,873
No bed.

2871
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,200
Dana hated Ben.

2872
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,833
Ask Him.

2873
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,060
They hated talk shit online
yet they went back and forth.

2874
01:18:41,061 --> 01:18:41,894
They chose brilliant.

2875
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:42,170
Yeah.

2876
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:43,820
Dana blocked him on Twitter.

2877
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:44,703
Yes,

2878
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,410
but valleys in,

2879
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,670
I got ahold of Dana and I said,

2880
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:50,720
he's a nice guy.

2881
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,291
I said,

2882
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:52,190
he's a fun guy.

2883
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:53,650
He's talking it.

2884
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:54,493
They ended up partying,

2885
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:57,250
especially with Ben becomes changed shit,

2886
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,220
Shitload of money to this and
they're going to be happy.

2887
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:02,430
They made this decision as Ben.

2888
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:03,770
He's not that old.

2889
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,660
He's already probably
thirties early thirties

2890
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:10,160
34 he's still fun to
do it for a hot minute,

2891
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:11,280
but he still fuck people up.

2892
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,680
Zero damage.

2893
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:15,080
He didn't take a punch
in his last two fights.

2894
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:18,800
He hasn't taken a punch in for like
you looked at the month it's been,

2895
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:19,910
has ever cracked.

2896
01:19:19,911 --> 01:19:20,560
Solid.

2897
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:20,810
Yeah,

2898
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,643
he's been here.

2899
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:25,070
He's been hit pretty hard
here on this list decision.

2900
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,060
And He,

2901
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,490
I remember the something
up he was telling me about,

2902
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:29,480
I don't want to speak out of school,

2903
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:30,314
so I won't even say what he said.

2904
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,190
I don't remember what he said,

2905
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,050
but there was an issue in his camp.

2906
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:33,860
But this one was,

2907
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,750
she was also striking a lot and he's like,

2908
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:37,400
what the fuck am I doing?

2909
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,830
You're not going to go in there
and do this and then change.

2910
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:40,880
His whole demeanor was just like,

2911
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:42,200
I'm bringing everybody down.

2912
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,250
I'm not going to get hit.

2913
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:43,611
Well,

2914
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,080
Floyd Mayweather here on,

2915
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:45,710
you know,

2916
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,160
he's uh,

2917
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,990
he's got real talent.

2918
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:48,531
I mean,

2919
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:53,060
Jay heroin lost to some really good
guys like George Saint Pierre and Tyron

2920
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,240
Woodley.

2921
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,990
But Jay heroin's a tough fighter and
he's got a good mix of wrestling and

2922
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:58,610
grappling and it was a,

2923
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,470
or a wrestling and striking rather.

2924
01:20:00,471 --> 01:20:04,600
And it was enough wrestling to get back
up when he was stuck on the bottom or

2925
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,770
prevent takedowns or fight him off.

2926
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,960
And they were looking at this man here,

2927
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:11,460
this nice little squeaky reversal.

2928
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:11,671
Yeah.

2929
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:13,280
So he can actually wrestle a bit too.

2930
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:14,670
And he hit it with a nice punch there.

2931
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:18,810
So Jay here on good terms
with a spinning back kick.

2932
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:19,351
Yeah.

2933
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:22,020
So Jay heroin is a tough guy,

2934
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:22,470
man.

2935
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:22,981
Really,

2936
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:25,440
really Jay here on restless all yeah.

2937
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:25,711
Yeah.

2938
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:27,110
He's a real wrestler and,

2939
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,840
and he's also got a lot of experience
and had a lot of experience striking.

2940
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,760
That was after he fought
George Saint Pierre,

2941
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,073
right?

2942
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:34,290
Yeah,

2943
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,250
I believe so for sure.

2944
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:36,870
That you have to check
to see if that's correct.

2945
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:37,733
That's correct.

2946
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,540
Cause I know Jay w w
that's after we've fought.

2947
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:42,360
They fought after he got
released from the UFC.

2948
01:20:42,361 --> 01:20:43,170
Is that what happened?

2949
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:44,003
Yeah.

2950
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:44,970
So anyway,

2951
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,250
that was like the toughest
test of his UFC career.

2952
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:50,940
But apparently there was another
fight that he had in one FC.

2953
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:51,871
Now this is,

2954
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:54,240
I'm getting this completely
second hand and I apologize,

2955
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:54,990
but I'm just,

2956
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:56,400
I didn't think we're
going to talk about this.

2957
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,560
I didn't prepare this
or anything like that,

2958
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:02,160
but I think someone was telling me that
he fought some dude and the fight got

2959
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:03,390
stopped by an eye poke,

2960
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,950
but that it was a tough fight.

2961
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:05,903
The Russian cat,

2962
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,250
it might've been the Russian cat.

2963
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:08,940
Look at that.

2964
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:09,600
Look at this fight.

2965
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,740
Damn it dear.

2966
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:11,420
You should feel that.

2967
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,080
Who's got that body triangle?

2968
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:13,890
I don't know.

2969
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,191
Shit.

2970
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:14,860
That's tight.

2971
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:15,750
Oh,

2972
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:18,893
close.

2973
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,340
Oh my goodness.

2974
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:21,810
I don't know if this is true.

2975
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,840
This is just my guests and I think
the first person to utilize that body

2976
01:21:27,151 --> 01:21:27,990
triangle.

2977
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:33,340
I'm authentically at a high level and
competition was John Jacques Machado.

2978
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:35,380
Abu Dhabi.

2979
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:35,730
Yup.

2980
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,990
He was the first one.

2981
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:40,530
I know there's old pictures
of catch wrestling with
guys and body triangles from

2982
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:41,160
the back,

2983
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:46,160
but in high level competition recorded
historical high level competition.

2984
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:47,364
Abu Dhabi,

2985
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:52,200
John Jacques Machado fucking ran through
guys putting that body triangle on the

2986
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:52,380
back.

2987
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,260
I remember asking him when
he got back from Abu Dhabi,

2988
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:59,280
why were you putting the figure four lock?

2989
01:21:59,370 --> 01:21:59,671
You know,

2990
01:21:59,671 --> 01:22:00,504
while you're on the back,

2991
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,400
why not just use the regular leg hooks?

2992
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:03,623
And he said,

2993
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:04,351
man,

2994
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:04,881
when you're gone,

2995
01:22:04,881 --> 01:22:07,370
no [inaudible] is so slippery unit.

2996
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:08,041
And he goes,

2997
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:09,270
you got to lock in the hips.

2998
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:11,730
And from that point on
that changed my game.

2999
01:22:11,731 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm like,

3000
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,331
okay,

3001
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:15,650
I guess when I get the back that's
going to be my main focus is putting a,

3002
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,550
a triangle body triangle on.

3003
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,240
And that was 1998 99 in that area.

3004
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,410
Well a lot of people don't know how much,

3005
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,510
well everybody knows you're
a John Jack Black belt,

3006
01:22:25,511 --> 01:22:30,010
but a lot of people don't know how
much John Shock style of Nogi is.

3007
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:34,990
What influenced you to come up with a
lot of the positions in moves from 10th

3008
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:35,430
planet.

3009
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:36,420
Not only me,

3010
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:37,830
but Marcello Garcia.

3011
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:42,900
John John Machado was the first
Marcella Garcia of the Abu Dhabi.

3012
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:43,980
Uh,

3013
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:44,813
um,

3014
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,140
historical archive.

3015
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:47,400
Yeah,

3016
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,091
he was the first one.

3017
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:52,020
Because when you look at Marcella
Garcia and no doubt Marcella Garcia,

3018
01:22:52,021 --> 01:22:55,170
when you're talking about the
greatest grappler of all time,

3019
01:22:55,260 --> 01:23:00,080
Pete Marcella Garcia as right there in
the conversation can easily be number one

3020
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:00,781
to say number one,

3021
01:23:00,781 --> 01:23:04,470
would it be Hixon I'm going
to say Marcella Garcia,

3022
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:07,150
Jacques Hixon number one,

3023
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:07,751
Roger,

3024
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:08,620
Gracie,

3025
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:09,670
um,

3026
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:10,930
half a Mendez,

3027
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:12,160
um,

3028
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,300
you know that level.

3029
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:17,080
But the first one in
Abu Dhabi was John Jock.

3030
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,550
When you look at what he did,

3031
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,670
he was using x guard and
he was getting the back,

3032
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:23,890
putting the body triangle is on the back,

3033
01:23:23,891 --> 01:23:28,210
was his shit and then Marcello
came and he was using x car to,

3034
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:28,781
not that,

3035
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:28,930
you know,

3036
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,970
I'm not taking anything
away from Marcella Garcia.

3037
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,510
Everybody,

3038
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:35,440
anybody that knows me knows that I've
given Marcella Garcia more props and

3039
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:36,640
fucking anybody living.

3040
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,753
I'd uh,

3041
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:38,200
uh,

3042
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,610
you don't have to explain that,

3043
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:40,211
but what I'm,

3044
01:23:40,211 --> 01:23:41,044
what I'm saying,

3045
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:43,690
what I'm saying right now is
one of the greatest of all time.

3046
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,020
Yeah.

3047
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:44,853
And so is John.

3048
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:45,110
Jack,

3049
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:46,870
they're both two of the
greatest of all times.

3050
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:47,950
There's a lot of that group.

3051
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:52,000
John [inaudible] was the first Abu Dhabi
legend as far as finishing goes when

3052
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:53,290
you're talking about the submissions,

3053
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:58,540
because in those early Abu Dhabi's you
had a bunch of wrestlers who are masters

3054
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:01,270
at controlling human
beings without clothing,

3055
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:04,000
but they didn't know how to pass
and they didn't want to finish.

3056
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:08,500
And then on the flip side you had
Brazilians who are masters of passing the

3057
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:10,780
guard and finishing their opponents,

3058
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,960
but they didn't really know how to
do it as well without the gooey.

3059
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:21,100
So he had a lot of stalemate and going
on and a lot of bickering and bantering

3060
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:23,200
back and forth about the
rule set and all that.

3061
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:24,860
After the first couple of years,

3062
01:24:24,861 --> 01:24:25,391
it's like people,

3063
01:24:25,391 --> 01:24:25,571
you know,

3064
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:26,550
you had the Jujitsu,

3065
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:27,430
Jujitsu guys,

3066
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:31,030
a stale mating with the wrestlers and
there's all this grease and all this sweat

3067
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:31,864
flying everywhere.

3068
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:35,200
And then enters John
Jacques and his first,

3069
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,300
his first year in Abu Dhabi,

3070
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:40,240
he submits everybody
and gets the gold medal.

3071
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,040
So at that point people were like,

3072
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,330
what the fuck?

3073
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:45,700
This guy doesn't even have
fingers on his left hand.

3074
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:48,040
How did it come in to Abu Dhabi?

3075
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:51,040
And tap everybody and win the gold medal.

3076
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,010
What is [inaudible] big like really big.

3077
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,001
Yeah.

3078
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:59,030
We just had the trials two weeks ago and
it was the biggest trials of all time.

3079
01:24:59,220 --> 01:24:59,940
The truck,

3080
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,590
there's like 60 70
people in each division.

3081
01:25:02,591 --> 01:25:03,050
Dan,

3082
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:04,380
think about that shit is it?

3083
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:05,590
Gosh,

3084
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:06,640
it's bigger than ever.

3085
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,050
She's just a switch.

3086
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,100
Complete gears to,

3087
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:09,611
how about that?

3088
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:10,750
Bare knuckle boxing.

3089
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:12,310
I finally caught watching it.

3090
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,320
Did you see in this weekend just not
fill brony Hendrix got knocked out but I

3091
01:25:18,371 --> 01:25:23,371
watched like exciting shit was boss
route and doing commentary was pretty

3092
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:25,890
excited.

3093
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,880
[inaudible] or just boxing?

3094
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:29,280
Just fucking box.

3095
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:30,681
You know you guys are,

3096
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:32,230
he's talking about he
don't want gloves and shit.

3097
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,223
Redo it again.

3098
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:34,390
Fucked up.

3099
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:39,470
You should be all over that shit
just to be on our own league,

3100
01:25:39,471 --> 01:25:39,820
Bro.

3101
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:41,980
Bare knuckle boxing as they
do in the states or Russian.

3102
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:42,790
It was here.

3103
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:43,091
Listen,

3104
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:44,080
don't give me a job,

3105
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,513
Brendan Shop.

3106
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,330
I have to do it.

3107
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:50,930
Anything that boss ruin attached to.

3108
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:52,660
Don't boss Dude.

3109
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:53,930
How about bare knuckle MMA?

3110
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:54,521
That's next,

3111
01:25:54,521 --> 01:25:55,090
right?

3112
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,200
Well it should just be tough.

3113
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:56,741
It should be.

3114
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:57,341
Call it coc.

3115
01:25:57,341 --> 01:26:00,160
How is that boxing happened?

3116
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:00,730
How?

3117
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:03,260
How hard is it going to be
to have bare knuckle MMS?

3118
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:03,980
[inaudible] we're

3119
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:04,731
just trying to stay,

3120
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:07,790
you know and amaze in like a motherfucker.

3121
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:11,300
We don't have to be arrests
all proper for anybody.

3122
01:26:11,301 --> 01:26:12,740
MMA is not going anywhere,

3123
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:13,574
so we don't have to.

3124
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,680
Let's be loaded down.

3125
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,920
If you could smash your
elbow into someones eye,

3126
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:22,070
if you could smash and elbow
your elbow across someone's nose,

3127
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:22,970
into their face,

3128
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:23,780
into their mouth,

3129
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,310
over and over again into their lips,

3130
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:26,144
into their teeth,

3131
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:27,231
their mouth guards.

3132
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:28,340
You can do that with your elbow.

3133
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,490
Why can't you punch them?

3134
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:32,990
Why can't you punch them?

3135
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:34,430
Free.

3136
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,330
Normal person.

3137
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,230
I don't mean normal.

3138
01:26:36,231 --> 01:26:39,430
Every casual fan turns on Fox and ESPN,

3139
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,400
wherever it's going to be on,

3140
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:43,060
and they see dudes with nothing on this.

3141
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:43,401
Michael,

3142
01:26:43,401 --> 01:26:44,270
this is barbaric.

3143
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:49,700
Reebok in rivers where if people thought
something and that something was not

3144
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:50,001
true,

3145
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:50,421
what do we do?

3146
01:26:50,421 --> 01:26:51,890
Do we educate them or do we go,

3147
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:52,240
well,

3148
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:52,641
not when we can.

3149
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:53,930
Do people just think differently.

3150
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,040
They don't know any better.

3151
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,780
Know team football.

3152
01:26:56,781 --> 01:26:57,800
Get rid of helmets.

3153
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:58,753
Yes,

3154
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:59,783
you really should.

3155
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:02,490
You know why that's they think
that'd be the one thing quit.

3156
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:06,850
What kind of leather type
thing they used to wear them.

3157
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,213
That George

3158
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,910
[inaudible].

3159
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:16,370
George [inaudible] still white dude.

3160
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,790
Super White Leather helmets on

3161
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:27,000
people would do to ruled support.

3162
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,730
You're talking about Babe Ruth,

3163
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,330
you're sober rating.

3164
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,310
There wasn't one

3165
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,190
when Jim Bro,

3166
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:37,580
shut up.

3167
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:42,380
Have you seen those highlight those epic
runs of Jim Brown and it's all white.

3168
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:48,640
He's putting on moves on these
white guy to do it though.

3169
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,320
First Black Nick came in
baseball and was like,

3170
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:54,230
what the fuck you're Dominican game over?

3171
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,730
Jim Brown had some of them.

3172
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,490
You got to watch his
greatest fucking runs.

3173
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:59,120
Oh,

3174
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,500
better than Barry Sanders and Oj Simpson.

3175
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:02,900
He's a better lacrosse player.

3176
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:04,400
Yeah,

3177
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,270
he's a Masha.

3178
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:09,920
Imagine playing their with Jim Brown
and he's allowed to hit you with that

3179
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:10,191
stick,

3180
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:10,461
right?

3181
01:28:10,461 --> 01:28:10,990
A little bit.

3182
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:11,900
Fuck yeah,

3183
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:13,820
a little bit with that stick.

3184
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,790
How much hit and make that stick?

3185
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:16,520
Can you get away with it?

3186
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,630
You can hit the arms.

3187
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:20,330
You just can't hit the heavy
closest colleges as any of us.

3188
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:20,800
What?

3189
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,760
How hard can it be?

3190
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:22,280
Both.

3191
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,160
I played the college.

3192
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:24,861
He played it.

3193
01:28:24,861 --> 01:28:25,281
I played it.

3194
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:25,800
Yeah.

3195
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:25,971
Well,

3196
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:27,050
how much can you beat each other?

3197
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:28,400
We can beat the shit each other.

3198
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:28,851
Your arms.

3199
01:28:28,851 --> 01:28:29,990
It's the way they have pads in the arms.

3200
01:28:29,991 --> 01:28:30,890
You hit the arms,

3201
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,210
the stick.

3202
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:32,600
You can,

3203
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,140
you can literally fucking court.

3204
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,440
Oh Shit.

3205
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:38,060
How was this sports still around?

3206
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,110
Let's cross.

3207
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,430
It's one of the oldest
sports in the world,

3208
01:28:40,431 --> 01:28:40,730
man,

3209
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:41,660
but here's the started it.

3210
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,860
It looks kind of fun.

3211
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:43,481
Basketball.

3212
01:28:43,481 --> 01:28:44,640
Oh my God.

3213
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:45,491
People get fucked up.

3214
01:28:45,491 --> 01:28:45,830
Okay.

3215
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:47,450
That dude just got way late.

3216
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:48,470
That's not illegal.

3217
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:48,861
Nah,

3218
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:49,694
man.

3219
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,500
On a Saturday afternoon.

3220
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,571
Why not get a minute?

3221
01:28:55,571 --> 01:28:55,911
Wait a minute.

3222
01:28:55,911 --> 01:28:56,360
Wait a minute.

3223
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,010
You're allowed to hit
each other with the stick.

3224
01:28:58,011 --> 01:28:59,140
Run into each other like that.

3225
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,111
Make the stick.

3226
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:01,410
Have contact with that head.

3227
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:01,800
Yeah,

3228
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,040
it's

3229
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,380
hockey on fucking grabs.

3230
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:04,830
It's warm.

3231
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:05,760
It's a great game.

3232
01:29:05,761 --> 01:29:06,690
It's a great game.

3233
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:07,621
Great game.

3234
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:08,940
If you like concussions,

3235
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:10,170
it's a great game.

3236
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,280
It's causing you watch,

3237
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:11,611
you watch.

3238
01:29:11,611 --> 01:29:12,540
How often do you watch it?

3239
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:13,613
The first one,

3240
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,740
and that's fun to play.

3241
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,180
If there's a game,

3242
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:19,014
that's great.

3243
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:21,120
That means you watch
it when you follow it.

3244
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,710
It's not great if you don't watch them.

3245
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:23,910
The problem is it great.

3246
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,530
I love it.

3247
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:26,670
I love to follow.

3248
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:28,200
I don't want to either.

3249
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:29,250
In Jujitsu is great,

3250
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,113
then you don't like

3251
01:29:31,810 --> 01:29:36,660
are missing these Kaos up in Lacrosse.

3252
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,830
Oh Jesus Christ.

3253
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,690
They're whipping their
fucking stick at each other.

3254
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:40,350
Dude,

3255
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:41,460
this is chaos.

3256
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,690
You got to sacrifice kickboxing for this.

3257
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:46,610
You've got to follow this down,

3258
01:29:46,611 --> 01:29:47,640
but let me tell you something.

3259
01:29:47,641 --> 01:29:48,930
They're striking each other.

3260
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,490
This is not like just,

3261
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:51,390
that's a strike.

3262
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,430
They said their elbow
strike in each other.

3263
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,260
They're not like just
running into each other,

3264
01:29:55,261 --> 01:29:55,401
do,

3265
01:29:55,401 --> 01:29:56,460
doing way worse.

3266
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,610
They're hitting each other with the
sticks and their Koa and each of them.

3267
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:01,560
Now Imagine Jim Brown.

3268
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:02,790
Oh my God,

3269
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:07,860
there are you going to watch each other
and smashing elbows into each other's

3270
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:08,560
faces.

3271
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,750
Rough and you gotta be fucking
athletic to be a midfield's.

3272
01:30:12,751 --> 01:30:16,890
Go back and forth the cardio
machine overnight in the cardio.

3273
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,600
I'm not denying the ferocity.

3274
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:19,703
I'm not denying,

3275
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:23,610
I'm not denying the size
of these guys balls.

3276
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:24,570
I'm not denying that.

3277
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,570
I'm just saying if you ain't following it,

3278
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:29,460
it's,

3279
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:30,241
it's okay.

3280
01:30:30,241 --> 01:30:30,930
At best.

3281
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:31,380
Yeah,

3282
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:31,890
I mean I can,

3283
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:32,930
the college us,

3284
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:33,630
you know,

3285
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,340
people say I love all music.

3286
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:37,770
I love all you like Mariachis like that.

3287
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:39,210
I love every style.

3288
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:42,630
How many Maniaci cds do you
have in your car right now?

3289
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:44,120
All of them.

3290
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:44,953
All

3291
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,950
you like Polka.

3292
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:47,843
You remember what he liked?

3293
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,970
Like a 12 disc CD changing ball,

3294
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:51,903
ma'am.

3295
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,550
And you pushed it into the cartridge.

3296
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,600
Chuck Chinese dude,

3297
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:58,350
I have a thousand cds
in the back of my truck

3298
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:01,381
changers.

3299
01:31:01,381 --> 01:31:01,891
Like everybody,

3300
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:02,671
if you were a ball,

3301
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:07,671
you at a tissue 12 this
change go with number six.

3302
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,550
So our stereo store with
him and he would just,

3303
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:14,821
Joe,

3304
01:31:14,821 --> 01:31:17,880
we'd go in and just give me the best shit.

3305
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,400
How long ago was that word?

3306
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:19,840
Well,

3307
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,640
once he money,

3308
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:23,100
I just wanted a sound.

3309
01:31:23,101 --> 01:31:25,140
I wanted to hear what the
best stereo sounds like.

3310
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,920
It sounds both.

3311
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:31,540
Didn't you say that word for word gives
me the figure out what to do and I said

3312
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:32,130
that shit.

3313
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:32,963
Do the best shit.

3314
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:34,380
Like what sounds the best?

3315
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,370
What car was it then?

3316
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:40,610
That was a Porsche 911 six twin
turbo and endure a Barracuda

3317
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,510
Acura NSX.

3318
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:46,913
All that

3319
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:50,430
makes an experience better.

3320
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,880
He had like the high
level Nsx back in the day.

3321
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:57,890
This was like tire barn
and we were at Jujitsu any,

3322
01:31:57,940 --> 01:32:00,370
he had a bucket tear and he
couldn't walk and he goes,

3323
01:32:00,371 --> 01:32:02,680
you got to take me to
the prolotherapy people.

3324
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:06,460
And I had a driver's NSX and
I knew how to drive stick,

3325
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:08,900
but high performance
sticks a little different.

3326
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,090
So we were panicking.

3327
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,370
He's fucking holding his needs.

3328
01:32:11,371 --> 01:32:11,801
He scream,

3329
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:11,951
you go,

3330
01:32:11,951 --> 01:32:13,720
you've got to take me to prolotherapy.

3331
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,080
And I joined the drivers,

3332
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,600
go to the prolotherapy doctor.

3333
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:17,434
You the MRI.

3334
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,313
Yeah,

3335
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,120
and I grinded his gears a
little bit and his fucking

3336
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:24,903
steam

3337
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:28,553
follicles.

3338
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,600
He was holding his leg and he's going,

3339
01:32:31,601 --> 01:32:32,434
you motherfucker,

3340
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,970
don't cry my shit.

3341
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:34,923
And I'm like,

3342
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:37,323
you

3343
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:39,040
were so mad.

3344
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:42,610
I know you've got your artistic,

3345
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,820
I'll never forget that.

3346
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,900
I forget everything except
the cultural moment stick.

3347
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:49,781
And I said,

3348
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:50,000
yeah,

3349
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,950
know how to drive a stick.

3350
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,061
He's like,

3351
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:52,211
yeah,

3352
01:32:52,211 --> 01:32:53,044
I got you bro.

3353
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:56,230
I actually lied and I didn't know he did.

3354
01:32:56,231 --> 01:33:00,230
I knew all my first car was a
Ford Pinto snake stick in a while.

3355
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:03,870
I remember those little tiny sports cars,

3356
01:33:03,871 --> 01:33:05,620
two seater Fiat's I had one of those.

3357
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:08,050
Those are the styles dude.

3358
01:33:08,051 --> 01:33:13,050
For a month I was driving around at 19
with the little two seater yellow Fiat

3359
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:13,270
Kahn.

3360
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:17,550
I'm the fucking man until it broke
down like all Fiat's do and I,

3361
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:18,640
I drove for a month.

3362
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:21,870
We could never figure out
how to fix that motherfucker

3363
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:24,980
fee out repair man.

3364
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:27,790
And it was a mid engine dude.

3365
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:31,630
That thing was so like it
was a fix it again Tony.

3366
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,950
That's what the outstanding for dude.

3367
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:37,930
Dude.

3368
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:38,231
I,

3369
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:42,610
there was one day when that car broke
down I realized who my friends really

3370
01:33:42,611 --> 01:33:43,150
were.

3371
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,510
Nobody wanted to come
pick me up for parties.

3372
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,550
I one night I started crying

3373
01:33:50,690 --> 01:33:52,870
like I don't really have any real friends.

3374
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:54,940
Everybody was partying,

3375
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,100
everyone was going out.

3376
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,273
Cause I lived,

3377
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:02,490
I lived in like kind of far how far
and I was the one picking 2025 minutes.

3378
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:07,240
Tell you that's why I was crying.

3379
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,290
Why do you think I was crying?

3380
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,071
I'm like,

3381
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:10,180
I love the friends.

3382
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:10,931
Yeah,

3383
01:34:10,931 --> 01:34:11,441
you're cool.

3384
01:34:11,441 --> 01:34:14,530
But 25 minutes is a long way
trying to fuck this girl.

3385
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:17,920
I realized how important cars were.

3386
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:23,350
Never forget when my with up on blocks
in my garage and nobody could figure it

3387
01:34:23,351 --> 01:34:23,860
out on.

3388
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:24,730
Nobody could figure it out.

3389
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:24,910
Dude,

3390
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:25,631
how great is this?

3391
01:34:25,631 --> 01:34:26,690
They're doing this throwback.

3392
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:28,960
This is like the throwback logos.

3393
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:30,870
Dope anniversary.

3394
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:33,060
This is the first time
Jermaine Deronn to me is fun.

3395
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:35,770
How crazy is that?

3396
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,120
So,

3397
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:39,430
and then there's Raquel Pennington
who is just a beast to high breakouts.

3398
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:39,791
Okay,

3399
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:40,624
check this out.

3400
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,150
How sexist is the UFC?

3401
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:43,984
Think about this

3402
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:46,730
in a joking way.

3403
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:47,663
There's a joking way.

3404
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,660
But when,

3405
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:52,420
when Raquel Pennington five Amanda Nunez,

3406
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:56,800
the one thing they had in common was
they both had girlfriends that were UFC

3407
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:57,590
fighters.

3408
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:58,311
They don't touch on.

3409
01:34:58,311 --> 01:34:59,240
Everything was fine.

3410
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:00,830
Everything was going
and it should be cool.

3411
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,980
But can you imagine if there was two
male fighters fighting for the belt and

3412
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:08,240
they both had boyfriends,

3413
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:12,230
they were all so UFC fighters to him.

3414
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:13,550
How crazy is that?

3415
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:14,151
We don't,

3416
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:17,480
we don't get that sexist though
because we don't let guys do that.

3417
01:35:17,481 --> 01:35:18,570
We're okay with girls though.

3418
01:35:18,571 --> 01:35:21,860
When he made the UFC want to give
a fuck if DC and Jon were gay,

3419
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:22,800
they come up there.

3420
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,101
You don't think,

3421
01:35:24,101 --> 01:35:24,620
you think,

3422
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:27,780
you think they would be okay with that
hundred percent as long as they were

3423
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:28,311
winning fights,

3424
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:28,730
they don't care.

3425
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:30,800
But here's what you have
to take into consideration.

3426
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:36,580
I don't think there's been any suppression
of a gay fighters and promotions.

3427
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,570
There hasn't been enough promotion.

3428
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:44,290
It's probably super hard for some
gay guys to get acceptance in gyms.

3429
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:45,253
Exactly.

3430
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:46,173
Exactly.

3431
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,740
It's got to be a gay gym,

3432
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:48,170
right?

3433
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:49,003
It's gotta be a gate.

3434
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:52,100
Someone who runs a gym is super open.

3435
01:35:52,101 --> 01:35:54,280
Miners got gotta be gang kickboxing,

3436
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:54,820
gay.

3437
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:55,700
You can be a guy,

3438
01:35:55,701 --> 01:35:56,534
that'd be easier.

3439
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,340
But check this out.

3440
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,173
Check this out.

3441
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,140
Because the problem is fight cultures,

3442
01:36:00,141 --> 01:36:04,850
old culture and that old old culture
from the boxing days and a lot of the

3443
01:36:04,851 --> 01:36:05,750
wrestling days,

3444
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,880
like there's this thought of,

3445
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:08,241
you know,

3446
01:36:08,241 --> 01:36:10,640
it's not the most
progressive concept that,

3447
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:10,910
uh,

3448
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:11,360
you know,

3449
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,440
gay guys,

3450
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:13,040
Whoa,

3451
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:13,873
Holy Shit.

3452
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,823
Celt Pennington,

3453
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:17,330
there's,

3454
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:18,920
there's not a sense of the quality.

3455
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:20,450
Check this out,

3456
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:20,850
don't,

3457
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:21,683
isn't it?

3458
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,820
This is my theory,

3459
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,460
my theory that show there's a,

3460
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,480
there's a disproportionate amount
of female lesbian fighters,

3461
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:30,110
uh,

3462
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:31,910
having success in the UFC,

3463
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:32,630
and this is my,

3464
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,370
this is my theory.

3465
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:33,921
You know why?

3466
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:34,490
You know why?

3467
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:35,450
You know why this is,

3468
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:39,020
my theory is their training
camps are not disruptive.

3469
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:40,730
If they were heterosexual,

3470
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,950
everybody would be making moves on him.

3471
01:36:42,951 --> 01:36:43,850
Their Dietitian.

3472
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:47,450
That's exactly kick boxing trainer.

3473
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:50,810
Everybody's going to be trying to make
moves on them when they're lesbian.

3474
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,760
Everybody just treats them like a guy

3475
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,193
thinking this,

3476
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,680
this is real.

3477
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:58,940
This is really a factor,

3478
01:36:58,941 --> 01:37:00,220
but I don't think that's awesome.

3479
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:01,490
I think Holly Holm,

3480
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:05,690
I think there's just some women like to
fight and maybe more lesbians like to

3481
01:37:05,691 --> 01:37:05,961
fight.

3482
01:37:05,961 --> 01:37:06,291
That's true.

3483
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:07,260
More draw to it.

3484
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:08,930
Straight women like to fight too.

3485
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:12,260
I think their camps or less
disruptive because you take a girl,

3486
01:37:12,261 --> 01:37:12,500
okay,

3487
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,180
let's just take a girl
probably like facts.

3488
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:15,590
Like let's take a small thing.

3489
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:20,570
The second UFC fighter that
looks as good as Paige vanzant.

3490
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:21,020
Yeah,

3491
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:21,853
she's just like that.

3492
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:26,950
Imagine all the Dick that's going
to be thrown at her every day.

3493
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:29,800
The dye houses.

3494
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,250
You want a chiropractor.

3495
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:32,140
If she was single,

3496
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,060
boxing was

3497
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:35,763
even if she's,

3498
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,070
if she's actually,

3499
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,530
especially if she's single,

3500
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,990
can you imagine the drama involved?

3501
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:42,591
Trust me,

3502
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:45,740
I'm in the fucking fight
game the girls are getting,

3503
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,280
if you're a heterosexual
girl and you're in the,

3504
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:51,050
you're in a Jujitsu being a hot moraine.

3505
01:37:51,051 --> 01:37:51,860
Exactly.

3506
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:55,430
But if you're lesbian and you're
hardcore guys still trying to forward,

3507
01:37:55,431 --> 01:37:56,010
but you're not,

3508
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,910
dude aren't going to go for it.

3509
01:37:57,030 --> 01:38:00,480
They're going to treat you like a dude
and you're going to have a drama free

3510
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:02,810
training camp and a school
and you're going to,

3511
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:04,260
you're going to this small,

3512
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,850
you're going to stick
with the school lung.

3513
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:07,170
Look at all the lesbian fighters.

3514
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:07,501
This is,

3515
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:09,790
we'll stick with the trainers
because they stick the best ones.

3516
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:10,360
The history.

3517
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,193
There's no drama,

3518
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:11,970
no drama.

3519
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:14,220
But this is what I think is
what you're saying is true.

3520
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:19,170
What you're saying is correct,

3521
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,600
but this is just a factor.

3522
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:22,680
There's a bunch of fallacies.

3523
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:24,810
Beautiful rose.

3524
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:25,850
Yeah,

3525
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:27,140
she's beautiful and raw,

3526
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:27,840
but no,

3527
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,673
no rose.

3528
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,090
All the top fighters are lesbian.

3529
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:37,140
I'm just saying there's a disproportionate
amount of top fighters that are

3530
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:40,590
lesbian and I think that's because you
know when you'll feel like we're all on

3531
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:44,790
the June rose Dama Junis got a gigantic
gorilla boyfriend that will fucking

3532
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:45,750
stomp on there.

3533
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,673
Yes.

3534
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:47,843
That's different.

3535
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:51,600
Can you imagine a Rose Rose
normal Junius was single.

3536
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,700
Can you imagine all the Dick,

3537
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:57,240
they would be flying at her like she'd
be doctoring shit like the Matrix.

3538
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:57,901
Respectfully.

3539
01:38:57,901 --> 01:38:58,260
You're right,

3540
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:58,740
right.

3541
01:38:58,740 --> 01:38:59,401
Hundred percent.

3542
01:38:59,401 --> 01:39:01,020
There's less drama dude.

3543
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:02,040
Cause in Jujitsu,

3544
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,950
not even striking a
restaurant just in Jujitsu,

3545
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,480
heterosexual girls.

3546
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:09,570
But that's Thomas comments field though.

3547
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,080
Hold on.

3548
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:10,860
Exactly.

3549
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:11,491
Exactly.

3550
01:39:11,491 --> 01:39:12,330
Even women are,

3551
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,560
that's proving my 0.0 at an MMA gym does
the way more contact with a guy and a

3552
01:39:19,891 --> 01:39:20,724
girl.

3553
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:22,213
Two girls,

3554
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:23,910
two girls are,

3555
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:24,210
are,

3556
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:24,550
are,

3557
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:25,910
are uh,

3558
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:30,300
are more prone to switch Jujitsu schools.

3559
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:32,150
Then she got a postcard would die,

3560
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:32,520
right?

3561
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,740
Cause they start dating a guy
from another school and they go,

3562
01:39:34,741 --> 01:39:35,510
you know what,

3563
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:37,290
let me go train at that
school on Saturdays,

3564
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:39,840
they started training on the school on
Saturdays and then the guys that their

3565
01:39:39,841 --> 01:39:40,291
schools are like,

3566
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,220
what are you trying to go over there?

3567
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:41,940
And,

3568
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,140
but dudes don't do that.

3569
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:45,460
But the girls do that because you know,

3570
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,830
because they're heterosexual.

3571
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:48,440
I think that there's a ledge.

3572
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,100
There's a little bit,

3573
01:39:50,101 --> 01:39:52,080
I'm not saying it's the be all end all.

3574
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:52,850
I'm going to sound,

3575
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:54,130
I don't think chicken bones.

3576
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:57,630
I don't think UFC highlights
Amanda Nunez enough being lesbian.

3577
01:39:57,631 --> 01:40:00,390
She should be on fucking every
poster in West Hollywood.

3578
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:02,040
Now check this out.

3579
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:03,533
Check this out.

3580
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:06,680
We don't fuck out of
Raquel Pennington who,

3581
01:40:06,681 --> 01:40:07,514
who's a beast.

3582
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,640
Shit.

3583
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,151
Think about,

3584
01:40:09,151 --> 01:40:11,640
think about onstar music marketable.

3585
01:40:11,641 --> 01:40:12,660
Then think about the music.

3586
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:14,940
There's a disproportionate amount of,

3587
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,890
of of all,

3588
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:20,670
I would say 90% of my
favorite singers are gay.

3589
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:23,820
I love this singer's singer Peter fucking,

3590
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:24,360
oh,

3591
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,620
I'm not even going to say his name.

3592
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:27,000
I don't want to bust anybody out.

3593
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,110
I'm just going to say,

3594
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:29,243
uh,

3595
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:29,440
no,

3596
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,060
no.

3597
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:30,870
Who knows?

3598
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:30,961
Uh,

3599
01:40:30,961 --> 01:40:31,621
Freddie Mercury,

3600
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:32,250
whatever.

3601
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:37,250
But what I'm saying is
there's a disproportionate
amount of gay vocalists out

3602
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:37,800
there,

3603
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,400
right?

3604
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,170
Think about currently and
gay Broadway can drive.

3605
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:44,280
You would think of people
that perform on Broadway.

3606
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:47,070
You think that these to
a healthy percentage,

3607
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:47,904
and think about this,

3608
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,280
we all know this,

3609
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,650
we all know this in the music industry,

3610
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,130
there's a lot

3611
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:58,750
of gay music producers
and music executives,

3612
01:40:58,751 --> 01:40:59,170
right?

3613
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:00,040
And they do creepy shit,

3614
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:00,820
right?

3615
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:01,750
Not because they're gay,

3616
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:04,010
just because the guys
that you guys happened.

3617
01:41:04,011 --> 01:41:07,450
Cause the dyes guys do creepy shit and
you're going to do creepy shit with

3618
01:41:07,451 --> 01:41:08,110
girls.

3619
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:08,711
Or if you're gay,

3620
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:09,880
you're going to do creepy shit with guys,

3621
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,260
girls in district court.

3622
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,830
There's a disproportionate
amount of gay singers out there.

3623
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:20,070
And how was that heterosexual singer
going to compete with the gay singer when

3624
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:23,380
they're ready to suck dick
at the drop of a fucking hat?

3625
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:24,580
You know what I mean?

3626
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:24,701
Well,

3627
01:41:24,701 --> 01:41:25,361
how bad you want to be.

3628
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:28,420
Batman references jungle
with a lot of guys.

3629
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,880
I'm not saying anything.

3630
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:34,360
I'm just saying there's a lot
of gay singers and there's
a lot of gay and I love

3631
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:35,290
gay singers.

3632
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,720
Most of my favorite
singers or gallons arguing,

3633
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:38,810
I'm sorry,

3634
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:41,620
let me phrase it this way.

3635
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:46,300
Are you saying that the same way that
like have a gal was trying to get into the

3636
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:47,140
music business,

3637
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:51,430
she could potentially run into some own
scrupulous males in the business who

3638
01:41:51,431 --> 01:41:53,770
prey on young girls trying
to enter it to the business?

3639
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,640
Exactly the same.

3640
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:55,710
Exactly.

3641
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:58,600
For young guys with gay guys,

3642
01:41:58,630 --> 01:41:59,171
if they're gay,

3643
01:41:59,171 --> 01:42:01,330
they're willing to suck
that producers Dick.

3644
01:42:01,331 --> 01:42:02,260
And if they're not,

3645
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:02,981
if they're straight,

3646
01:42:02,981 --> 01:42:03,814
it's going to be hard.

3647
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,903
There's some

3648
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:09,270
dudes in bands like bass
players and drummers are like,

3649
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,720
do we need a gay singer to
get a deal up in [inaudible]?

3650
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,660
So they look for gay singers.

3651
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,850
I don't know the music industry.

3652
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:17,171
Oh Shit.

3653
01:42:17,171 --> 01:42:18,850
Look at that Germain de Randamie one too.

3654
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,890
That was nasty.

3655
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:20,890
You know,

3656
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:22,240
one of the worst champions of all time,

3657
01:42:22,241 --> 01:42:24,030
but it's fucking skilled man.

3658
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:24,461
Dude.

3659
01:42:24,461 --> 01:42:26,590
Really high level stand standup,

3660
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:27,970
14 time world champion,

3661
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:28,720
some shit like that.

3662
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:29,051
Very,

3663
01:42:29,051 --> 01:42:32,830
very good striking but did not
want nothing to do with Cyborg.

3664
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:33,910
Isn't that fascinating?

3665
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:34,901
Literally it was like,

3666
01:42:34,901 --> 01:42:35,130
you know what,

3667
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:36,900
I have to hand her town.

3668
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:39,880
She beat Holly should be here.

3669
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:40,510
Well,

3670
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:41,680
here's why I agree with you.

3671
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:45,040
Holly clanged her with a question
mark kick and dropped her.

3672
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:48,040
She had her stunned with that and then
she dropped her with a straight left

3673
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:48,640
hand.

3674
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,980
Those are two hugely significant moments.

3675
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,750
He only significant moments really?

3676
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,320
Well there was Jermaine hit
her after the bell twice,

3677
01:42:56,350 --> 01:43:00,250
twice and I think the second time you
should have taken a point away because it

3678
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:00,640
was,

3679
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,120
it was,

3680
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,230
they were hurting her.

3681
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,450
Did the last one she
landed after the bell.

3682
01:43:04,451 --> 01:43:05,170
I think it was,

3683
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:06,220
was it the second round?

3684
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:06,550
Oh.

3685
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:07,540
Oh Shit.

3686
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:09,350
Hey Jermaine piece.

3687
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:14,450
Solid fucking strike or petty shit.

3688
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,580
Did you hear what we're saying?

3689
01:43:15,581 --> 01:43:16,414
Champion dude?

3690
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:17,501
No,

3691
01:43:17,501 --> 01:43:19,450
she's a multiple time world champion.

3692
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:21,670
Her kickboxing is out of this world,

3693
01:43:21,671 --> 01:43:22,180
man.

3694
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:24,250
She had some insane kickboxing record.

3695
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:25,090
Jamie pull up or cake.

3696
01:43:25,091 --> 01:43:25,181
Well,

3697
01:43:25,181 --> 01:43:28,900
I'm surprised they gave Raquel Penton
this fight and I'm just an awful fucking

3698
01:43:28,901 --> 01:43:29,591
beast man.

3699
01:43:29,591 --> 01:43:30,510
Not when it comes to the shredder.

3700
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:31,540
Well,

3701
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:34,450
she's just fighting a woman
who's just way better than her.

3702
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,400
So it was Amanda Nunez fucking record.

3703
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:37,690
Those are all wins,

3704
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:38,470
son.

3705
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,490
No world champion.

3706
01:43:39,491 --> 01:43:41,950
Dude kicked loads 37.

3707
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:42,730
Oh,

3708
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:43,690
Holy Shit.

3709
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,111
Yeah,

3710
01:43:44,111 --> 01:43:44,351
Dude.

3711
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:45,220
And he's Lanky.

3712
01:43:45,221 --> 01:43:47,890
She's got wide shoulders
nightmare to deal with.

3713
01:43:47,891 --> 01:43:48,570
Here's the thing,

3714
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:48,860
man,

3715
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:49,430
here's the thing.

3716
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:49,781
She didn't,

3717
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:50,760
she work CyBorD and she,

3718
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:53,980
because she doesn't want
she the fuck out cyborgs.

3719
01:43:53,981 --> 01:43:56,660
Two big cyborg she said was a perennial.

3720
01:43:56,661 --> 01:43:56,951
What'd you,

3721
01:43:56,951 --> 01:43:57,570
what'd you call her?

3722
01:43:57,570 --> 01:43:59,110
[inaudible] user or some shit.

3723
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:00,340
She had like a,

3724
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:01,400
like a,

3725
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,233
I don't want to,

3726
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,520
I don't want to misquote.

3727
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:05,271
Scared was like,

3728
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:05,531
you know what,

3729
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:06,351
I'll vacate the belt.

3730
01:44:06,351 --> 01:44:07,250
Fuck that noise.

3731
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:08,870
I'm going to go back paraphrase.

3732
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:13,670
She essentially was saying that Cyborg
has cheated and that she's used steroids.

3733
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,700
I don't know what [inaudible] is.

3734
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:17,930
And she said because of that
she didn't want to fight her.

3735
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:19,700
The first set her hand hurt.

3736
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:20,091
Then she was like,

3737
01:44:20,091 --> 01:44:20,331
you know what,

3738
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:21,164
fuck national on this.

3739
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,690
She said she needed thumb
surgery and she didn't.

3740
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:24,230
Um,

3741
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:27,380
she brought that up like immediately
when I asked her about fighting Cyborg.

3742
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:29,990
But I think sideboards the
Bogie woman to these people.

3743
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:30,853
That's what I think.

3744
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,320
I think she's so much
bigger than everybody else.

3745
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:37,180
I mean she's cutting down from
one 75 one 80 or beat the shit.

3746
01:44:37,181 --> 01:44:42,020
Even she is not sure she'd
get up to shake it up,

3747
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:42,920
shake it up there bro.

3748
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:43,440
She,

3749
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,830
she a big woman to one 35 no,

3750
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:48,160
41 45 45 do,

3751
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,800
don't want to fuck with her
two to five with that girl.

3752
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:56,150
Think about how big Conor is condor's
walking around at one 70 ish.

3753
01:44:56,151 --> 01:44:56,371
Right.

3754
01:44:56,371 --> 01:44:57,860
And he used to cut down to one 45.

3755
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:58,460
Yeah,

3756
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:58,701
this,

3757
01:44:58,701 --> 01:44:59,750
think about that.

3758
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,740
Now cyborg basically
somewhere in that same range.

3759
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:04,641
That's what's going on.

3760
01:45:04,641 --> 01:45:04,791
Yeah,

3761
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:05,624
that's huge.

3762
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:06,523
That's a lot of weight.

3763
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:11,360
A lot of weight to cut somewhere in the
one 70 and maybe it made me even during

3764
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:12,240
the off season two,

3765
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:13,160
she gets even heavier.

3766
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:16,160
[inaudible] me just hit her with
a fucking nasty straight leg.

3767
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:20,300
How bout the fucking Amanda Nunez
Cyborg fight ended December.

3768
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:21,231
Jon Jones,

3769
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:22,530
Guzman St Clark.

3770
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,940
Do Small grants to small looks.

3771
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:27,020
So nasty.

3772
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:27,720
Look.

3773
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:28,553
Kind of good.

3774
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:29,750
I gotta get Outta here.

3775
01:45:29,751 --> 01:45:34,360
I gotta go to 10 planet 15
year anniversary party tonight.

3776
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,470
Bobby Lee's gonna perform.

3777
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:41,650
Sam Tripoli's going to perform
Simone Leigh Psi at Bobby Slayton.

3778
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:42,920
What time's it start?

3779
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,110
It starts at a right now.

3780
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:46,303
Damn.

3781
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:47,210
I gotta get Outta here.

3782
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:49,010
He sat on it 15 years,

3783
01:45:49,011 --> 01:45:49,670
baby.

3784
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:49,971
Damn.

3785
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:51,120
Congrats with thank you ma'am.

3786
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,890
Did you were there that
first day 15 years ago.

3787
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:56,310
God Damn,

3788
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:58,640
that's not a time flies
like a motherfucker.

3789
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,000
Taz.

3790
01:45:59,000 --> 01:45:59,300
Dude.

3791
01:45:59,300 --> 01:45:59,630
Dude,

3792
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:00,980
I have so many black belts.

3793
01:46:00,981 --> 01:46:01,731
It's incredible.

3794
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:05,870
I got today we had a business meeting
because this weekend is the 10th planet

3795
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:06,740
eclipse weekend.

3796
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:10,190
We do it every year and
we have the holiday party.

3797
01:46:10,191 --> 01:46:13,650
We have a quintet at 10 versus 10 show.

3798
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:14,421
That was last night.

3799
01:46:14,421 --> 01:46:15,290
There was insane.

3800
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,600
Here's those quintet's are amazing man.

3801
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:22,220
And then tonight we have the party
and then tomorrow we have the 10 Pq,

3802
01:46:22,221 --> 01:46:24,920
which is the 10th planet
qualifier for the next Dbi,

3803
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:25,441
which is a,

3804
01:46:25,441 --> 01:46:26,480
the strawweight girls.

3805
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:27,830
Uh,

3806
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:28,311
man.

3807
01:46:28,311 --> 01:46:28,880
Um,

3808
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,260
did you get a legit business?

3809
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:31,760
I just rounded.

3810
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:34,490
I'm surrounded by dudes who can kill me.

3811
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,590
I got all around.

3812
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:35,900
I might,

3813
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,711
these motherfuckers,

3814
01:46:36,711 --> 01:46:37,401
if they wanted to,

3815
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:39,020
they could just end my life.

3816
01:46:39,021 --> 01:46:40,110
Right now you've shown no,

3817
01:46:40,111 --> 01:46:40,851
it's pretty crazy.

3818
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:42,620
Your master split is pretty much turtles.

3819
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,950
I got fucking budget turtles
and Saturday all around me.

3820
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:46,551
You know,

3821
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:47,870
Shit ever hits the fan,

3822
01:46:48,290 --> 01:46:48,741
you know?

3823
01:46:48,741 --> 01:46:49,320
Um,

3824
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,130
you want to be hanging

3825
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,240
out with Jujitsu clans.

3826
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:52,950
That's for God damn sure.

3827
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:54,150
Unless it's a fire,

3828
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:59,151
but you two people are generally more
calm because they're going to war all the

3829
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:00,444
time.

3830
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,130
They get all that shit
out of their system.

3831
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:03,120
They're way more chill,

3832
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:03,721
you know,

3833
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:04,351
the way more,

3834
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:04,750
uh,

3835
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:06,910
no relax food.

3836
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:10,440
How easy it would be just to put
someone in a rear naked choke.

3837
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:11,460
And he was like,

3838
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:11,970
you know what?

3839
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:12,803
Yep.

3840
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,440
You know,

3841
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,190
if you don't train,

3842
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:15,090
if you don't train,

3843
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:17,460
if you don't train and you're
not a doctor you're doing,

3844
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:21,870
if you're not a doctor or some kind
of macgyver and you don't train,

3845
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:23,610
we're going to have to eat
you to what you said before,

3846
01:47:23,611 --> 01:47:27,600
the podcast was so funny
about the apocalypse that
homeless people are going to

3847
01:47:27,601 --> 01:47:28,980
be psyched because it'd be like,

3848
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:29,720
ah,

3849
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:31,580
people waiting,

3850
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,590
waiting for the end of the world.

3851
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,660
They're taking the fires because
they're going to be running shit.

3852
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:37,770
They're going to be the cause.

3853
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,640
They know what they're doing.

3854
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:40,260
They know the spots and shit.

3855
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:44,230
The good is not going
to change their life.

3856
01:47:44,231 --> 01:47:45,250
It might get better.

3857
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:46,140
What's going to get crowded?

3858
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:47,130
Dude's in favelas.

3859
01:47:47,131 --> 01:47:48,240
If you live in a favela,

3860
01:47:48,241 --> 01:47:50,730
you don't have to worry about them in
the world cause it's already the end of

3861
01:47:50,731 --> 01:47:51,390
the world for you.

3862
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:52,020
You know what I mean?

3863
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:53,400
You already got your Shit mastered.

3864
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,150
Most people that are walking around
pushing shopping carts with all these

3865
01:47:57,151 --> 01:47:58,530
plastic bags hanging off them,

3866
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:02,970
they're probably most likely mentally
ill batshit crazy where I'll probably be

3867
01:48:02,971 --> 01:48:03,320
able to,

3868
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:06,630
it's probably mk ultra throwaways.

3869
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,790
It's probably a tag trafficking
throws his way to that.

3870
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:10,920
Yeah,

3871
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:11,753
it might be.

3872
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:12,793
It might be.

3873
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:18,070
I think some of them have to be some
throw away cause we all know a trafficking

3874
01:48:19,401 --> 01:48:21,460
is going on and I'm like
what happens to these people?

3875
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:22,830
We know a lot of them are veterans.

3876
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,110
That's where it gets real scary.

3877
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:25,141
Super.

3878
01:48:25,141 --> 01:48:26,280
Dot of them are veterans.

3879
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:29,790
A lot of a lot of veterans come home and
they don't know what the fuck to do and

3880
01:48:29,791 --> 01:48:30,624
um,

3881
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,380
you know,

3882
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,141
oh that scared me.

3883
01:48:32,141 --> 01:48:34,980
I said be McGregor but it
says now available and bypass.

3884
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:35,963
I was like,

3885
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:39,420
oh my God dude,

3886
01:48:39,421 --> 01:48:40,230
you're the best.

3887
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:41,063
Congrats man.

3888
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:44,490
I'll call you later brother house wedding.

3889
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,353
Rehurt

3890
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,690
later let her dude to sit over here.

3891
01:48:48,691 --> 01:48:49,710
I'll feel what's can be weird,

3892
01:48:49,711 --> 01:48:50,220
right?

3893
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:51,053
Uber driver,

3894
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:53,250
that friend and you have an extra friend,

3895
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:55,400
the friends in the front seat and
that friend leaves and the friend,

3896
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:57,100
the back seat stays in the back seat.

3897
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:57,511
Like,

3898
01:48:57,511 --> 01:48:57,931
hey man,

3899
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:58,830
you got to get up here.

3900
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:01,050
Fuck this dude.

3901
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,980
Jam Germane to Rhonda.

3902
01:49:04,981 --> 01:49:06,000
Me Looks Spooky.

3903
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:09,540
She is so dangerous because
she doesn't do anything wrong.

3904
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,230
You know,

3905
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:11,130
show calculating.

3906
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:15,330
It's super like super technical
with her movements too.

3907
01:49:15,331 --> 01:49:16,770
And she's basically playing like a,

3908
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,180
a rhythm dance.

3909
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,430
She's forcing Raquel into movements,

3910
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:23,940
but she has the solutions to those
movements like several steps ahead.

3911
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:24,691
But here's the thing,

3912
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:24,871
Joe,

3913
01:49:24,871 --> 01:49:29,871
think about how many more fights
Dramamine it's been in that Kal,

3914
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:32,710
I [inaudible] cold remotely.

3915
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:34,920
Well not just bands
factor at a high level.

3916
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:37,500
Pennington would have to really
struggle to take her down.

3917
01:49:37,501 --> 01:49:40,830
She's a one 45 or in Pennington
has been fighting at one 35,

3918
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:41,681
you know,

3919
01:49:41,681 --> 01:49:44,340
and Jermaine dropped down
to 35 for this fight,

3920
01:49:44,341 --> 01:49:44,640
right?

3921
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,020
Is this the 35 or 45?

3922
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:47,020
35.

3923
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,010
So Jermaine dropped

3924
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,280
back down to 35 after
that 145 pound fight.

3925
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:51,971
Oh Shit.

3926
01:49:51,971 --> 01:49:52,804
Head kick.

3927
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:53,740
Um,

3928
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:58,740
so she's super strong for the weight
class and it didn't [inaudible] tough

3929
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:01,870
record to the salty six and five or some,

3930
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:02,770
she's type shit.

3931
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:04,030
She's as tough as they come.

3932
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:04,301
You know,

3933
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:07,300
one of my favorite finishes
ever was her versus Ashley,

3934
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:07,841
Evan Smith,

3935
01:50:07,841 --> 01:50:10,730
because he was just
this wild fucking fall.

3936
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:14,590
And then she catches her in a bulldog
choke and puts her unconscious for like a

3937
01:50:14,591 --> 01:50:16,510
second to the last fight.

3938
01:50:16,511 --> 01:50:17,650
And Deborah to was,

3939
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:20,890
she's from Colorado Springs so they
usually put on the Denver cards.

3940
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,990
I think I'm a fan.

3941
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:23,771
I'm a fan too.

3942
01:50:23,771 --> 01:50:25,480
She's just so damn tough man.

3943
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:26,440
But Duran me,

3944
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:26,860
I just,

3945
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:31,270
I hate this matchup for
after fucking Amanda Nunez.

3946
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:35,900
Well it's a scary matchup cause she's
ranked number foods that uppercut goddamn.

3947
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:38,060
It's scary because it's,

3948
01:50:38,061 --> 01:50:40,210
it's real similar and maybe,

3949
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:40,960
you know,

3950
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,960
Duran to me is even more a more
lethal with all the different things.

3951
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,320
I'm not hating on all,

3952
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:49,360
but trend me looks identical to the gang.

3953
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:51,630
Kickbox kickboxer that beats
the fuck out of junk club.

3954
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:52,473
[inaudible] friend,

3955
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,840
the scary dude who's kicking the walls.

3956
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:01,560
The thing about Duran to me that makes
her just see for sure Amanda Nunez has

3957
01:51:02,111 --> 01:51:06,430
more power and she'll assault you and
she's more aggressive and reckless.

3958
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:07,780
Like she comes after you,

3959
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:08,090
uh,

3960
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:08,923
Nunez.

3961
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:09,670
Yes.

3962
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:10,520
And she's a murderer.

3963
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:13,710
Power and more power at her
hands are just stuttering speed.

3964
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,790
And then she's not so
black belt on the ground.

3965
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:16,750
She's a bit of a beast,

3966
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:18,370
but I think it's the
power is the difference.

3967
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:21,520
But Duran to me has the full arsenal,

3968
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:22,121
you know what I mean?

3969
01:51:22,121 --> 01:51:23,230
Like as far as her tech,

3970
01:51:23,231 --> 01:51:24,070
she's a surgeon.

3971
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:24,761
Yes.

3972
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:25,600
That's a good way to put it.

3973
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:26,410
Everything she,

3974
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:29,680
all of her striking is dumped
so efforts effortlessly.

3975
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:31,600
It's all efficiently and smooth.

3976
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,460
And there's no like weird,

3977
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:35,950
like moments where hands are down.

3978
01:51:35,951 --> 01:51:38,910
She's lunging or footwear Ballance never.

3979
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:39,940
The only time she,

3980
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:40,630
you know,

3981
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:42,100
struggled severely.

3982
01:51:42,101 --> 01:51:42,940
It was against Holly Holm,

3983
01:51:42,941 --> 01:51:47,170
who's also a worldclass boxer and
tricky because Holly is different than

3984
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:49,120
probably a lot of the
strikers that she faced.

3985
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:50,051
He's a big boy.

3986
01:51:50,051 --> 01:51:50,710
Thai people.

3987
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,401
Yes she is.

3988
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:52,390
Because she's very strong.

3989
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:53,080
Athletic.

3990
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:53,441
Yeah.

3991
01:51:53,441 --> 01:51:56,110
And she also has got
sneaky shit that she does.

3992
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:57,670
Like that question mark kick,

3993
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,361
you know what I mean?

3994
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:00,190
She claimed her right off
the head with that one.

3995
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:00,580
You know,

3996
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:04,540
that was a big moment because Duran to
me was in the beginning of the fight was

3997
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:06,340
kind of controlling the page
and controlling the rhythm.

3998
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:08,380
And Holly had a finder spots and,

3999
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:10,600
and a lot of people thought she
could have won that decision.

4000
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:10,930
It was,

4001
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:11,770
it was real close.

4002
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,230
It's a tough spot for [inaudible] me
where they go and now you're fighting

4003
01:52:14,231 --> 01:52:14,710
Cyborg.

4004
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:15,071
And she's like,

4005
01:52:15,071 --> 01:52:16,300
fuck that man.

4006
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:18,340
So then you know she had
stripped of the title.

4007
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:19,510
We all shit on her,

4008
01:52:19,511 --> 01:52:20,800
but it must have been a tough position.

4009
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:21,641
Well,

4010
01:52:21,641 --> 01:52:24,030
if she has real feelings
about this and she really,

4011
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:24,221
oh,

4012
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:25,054
something happened.

4013
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:26,771
What happened?

4014
01:52:26,771 --> 01:52:27,604
Grabbing the shorts.

4015
01:52:27,790 --> 01:52:28,091
I don't know.

4016
01:52:28,091 --> 01:52:28,924
Something happened.

4017
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:30,463
Hit her in the titty.

4018
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:32,350
Did she go low?

4019
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:34,053
Did they take,

4020
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:36,400
did they take a cooler shot?

4021
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,391
Do you pause?

4022
01:52:37,391 --> 01:52:38,224
So I took it.

4023
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:39,970
What happened Jamie?

4024
01:52:39,971 --> 01:52:40,450
What happened?

4025
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:41,950
I poke the pussy shot.

4026
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:43,060
Was it?

4027
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:43,820
Come on.

4028
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:44,653
Was it,

4029
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:47,000
I think it was either
shorter fence grabbing.

4030
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,290
That guy's a hard part.

4031
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:51,800
It might be a sense grabbing fence or
it seems like the given her a chance to

4032
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:52,634
recover.

4033
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:53,481
God it,

4034
01:52:53,481 --> 01:52:54,500
I wish we were paying attention.

4035
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:56,270
It's something happened.

4036
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:57,410
Can we rewind a bit?

4037
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:57,560
Oh,

4038
01:52:57,560 --> 01:52:58,393
but then we'll fuck everybody.

4039
01:52:58,410 --> 01:52:58,860
Yeah,

4040
01:52:58,860 --> 01:52:59,693
it'd be a nightmare.

4041
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:00,800
She dragged me.

4042
01:53:00,801 --> 01:53:01,790
Just apologize.

4043
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:02,960
I wonder what it was.

4044
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:05,030
It seems like a f a Pho strong.

4045
01:53:05,390 --> 01:53:06,201
I'm strong J oh,

4046
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:06,471
nice.

4047
01:53:06,471 --> 01:53:08,450
Neat fuck but not,

4048
01:53:08,451 --> 01:53:11,480
but doesn't go net lateral
notice straight back.

4049
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:12,090
Right.

4050
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:14,270
Still good takedown defense,

4051
01:53:14,271 --> 01:53:17,960
but accepting the fact that clinch is
definitely going to happen as opposed to

4052
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:19,580
like almost wants to clinch.

4053
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,530
Well almost maybe a fire.

4054
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,740
It's also the end of the third and
she's been winning all the rounds,

4055
01:53:24,741 --> 01:53:25,101
so she's like,

4056
01:53:25,101 --> 01:53:25,341
all right,

4057
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:25,801
cool man.

4058
01:53:25,801 --> 01:53:26,634
Let's say for me.

4059
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:26,840
Yeah,

4060
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,310
I'll just knocked down to myself.

4061
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:32,870
Let me catch my breath and then get
you off me and finished around strong,

4062
01:53:32,871 --> 01:53:34,380
but she's going to have a
hard time getting her off.

4063
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,551
Dude,

4064
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:36,320
I'm nervous for these next two fights.

4065
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:40,270
The Korean Zombie one's
interesting because yeah,

4066
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:41,990
there's been out for a hot fucking minute.

4067
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:42,421
Mary,

4068
01:53:42,421 --> 01:53:42,741
he's base.

4069
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:44,270
He signed with Bellator,

4070
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:48,380
like he was going through that whole thing
where he turned down as a beat fight.

4071
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:49,170
Then they go,

4072
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:49,341
right,

4073
01:53:49,341 --> 01:53:50,240
if you're not fighting to beat,

4074
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:51,170
we're going to cut you.

4075
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:52,153
Then he's a guy

4076
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:54,381
and then they're like,

4077
01:53:54,381 --> 01:53:54,980
write your findings.

4078
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:55,371
A beat.

4079
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:56,204
There's a beat.

4080
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:58,330
Pulls out two d step.

4081
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,900
Beautiful one right hand,

4082
01:53:59,901 --> 01:54:00,440
left hook,

4083
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,310
right leg kick.

4084
01:54:01,690 --> 01:54:01,910
Do.

4085
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:03,020
She's fun to watch,

4086
01:54:03,021 --> 01:54:03,261
man.

4087
01:54:03,261 --> 01:54:04,490
She got a bad rap because the,

4088
01:54:04,491 --> 01:54:04,731
you know,

4089
01:54:04,731 --> 01:54:06,080
some on the Cyborg stuff.

4090
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:07,220
Well,

4091
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:08,240
you know what man,

4092
01:54:09,690 --> 01:54:10,420
it is what,

4093
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,270
that is what it is.

4094
01:54:11,271 --> 01:54:12,710
We've said so much about that.

4095
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:15,310
There's really no reason to
continue to talk about it now.

4096
01:54:15,490 --> 01:54:18,590
Just want to look at the
reality of who they are today.

4097
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:21,410
Cyborg is just waste carrier
than any of those girls.

4098
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,570
One of the things that makes Amanda Nunez,

4099
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,111
uh,

4100
01:54:24,111 --> 01:54:27,020
interesting as an opponent
for Cyborg is first of all,

4101
01:54:27,021 --> 01:54:28,580
her last fight with Raquel Pennington,

4102
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:29,690
she showed a lot of movement.

4103
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:31,670
I think she needs a shitload
of movement in this fight.

4104
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,180
She would need all the moves.

4105
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:35,390
She needs to be in fucking shape.

4106
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:39,110
She needs to be in serious shape
and she needs to be strong rounds.

4107
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:41,660
And this is one of the things that
Amanda noon that said at the press

4108
01:54:41,661 --> 01:54:42,494
conference,

4109
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,611
the press conference,

4110
01:54:43,611 --> 01:54:46,880
press conferences is interesting
because Cyborg was accusing her of,

4111
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:47,570
uh,

4112
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:50,300
I think not fighting
or at a previous time.

4113
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,850
And she said she needed more time.

4114
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:55,610
I think they wanted to
try to do those too.

4115
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:56,151
They did.

4116
01:54:56,151 --> 01:54:59,540
They'd be trying from Madison Square
Garden while Amanda Nunez goes,

4117
01:54:59,541 --> 01:55:00,261
I need more time,

4118
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:01,370
which I actually liked that.

4119
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:05,690
I liked that too because she's the
smaller woman coming up as 135 pound

4120
01:55:05,691 --> 01:55:06,380
champion,

4121
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:08,240
challenging the hundred 45 pound champion.

4122
01:55:08,241 --> 01:55:10,340
She's going to have to put some
weight on to want to keep it on and be

4123
01:55:10,341 --> 01:55:13,670
comfortable with it on and hopefully
get above one 45 so she can cut a little

4124
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:17,240
because the reality of
Cyborg is she's way bigger.

4125
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,070
She's probably walking around.

4126
01:55:19,130 --> 01:55:19,580
How many,

4127
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,590
how many pounds bigger
would you guess then Amanda?

4128
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,760
Just naturally,

4129
01:55:22,761 --> 01:55:24,770
just naturally 25 30 probably.

4130
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:25,610
What did you think?

4131
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:27,550
There's a number I
would like to play with.

4132
01:55:27,551 --> 01:55:28,970
That number is at least 20 [inaudible].

4133
01:55:28,971 --> 01:55:30,440
Say It would be 2020 to be fair.

4134
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:31,011
20 pounds.

4135
01:55:31,011 --> 01:55:32,210
That's entirely possible.

4136
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:37,211
It would be 20 so if Amanda Nunez is the
hundred and 35 pound women's champion,

4137
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:41,180
what does she actually
way we're saying if you,

4138
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:42,380
if you think the Cyborg is,

4139
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:42,791
let's give her,

4140
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:45,270
it was be generous and say
it's in the one seventies yes.

4141
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:48,150
And then she cuts down to one
45 and we don't know by the way,

4142
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:49,530
we just have red things.

4143
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:53,850
I would like to know like let's see if
Cyborg has ever commented on what she

4144
01:55:53,851 --> 01:55:55,290
weighs before she starts her weight.

4145
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:56,124
Cut.

4146
01:55:57,110 --> 01:55:57,390
Lock,

4147
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:58,410
high sixties right?

4148
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,460
Maybe let's,

4149
01:55:59,461 --> 01:56:04,050
let's get crazy and say it's one 60
even one 60 would be a lot of weight.

4150
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:05,160
Bigger than a man of Nunez,

4151
01:56:05,161 --> 01:56:05,994
wouldn't you think?

4152
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:11,060
100% what does Amanda Nunez way 50 you
think she weighs one 50 when she walks

4153
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:15,270
around normally and cuts down to one
35 [inaudible] she's very strong.

4154
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:16,770
Rock stuck,

4155
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:17,850
jacked.

4156
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:19,860
She's got all that back power man,

4157
01:56:19,861 --> 01:56:20,700
when she punches,

4158
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:24,560
she fucking has the longest
punches like you my favorites.

4159
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:25,140
But she's,

4160
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:26,700
she punches so long.

4161
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,690
It's like she's hitting you with science
team and she's hitting you way at the

4162
01:56:30,691 --> 01:56:31,440
end.

4163
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,450
And she's fucking aggressive as shit.

4164
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:34,471
But um,

4165
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:39,471
so maybe let's say she weighs
one 45 one 50 at the most,

4166
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:41,340
let's say 50 at the most.

4167
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:44,740
Cyber could be one 70 she
could be bigger than one.

4168
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,860
She's rolling around sixties
you think she's in her sixties?

4169
01:56:47,861 --> 01:56:48,390
Yeah.

4170
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:50,250
She thinks she's in his sixties now.

4171
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:52,710
Or you think she's in
the 60s all the time.

4172
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:57,390
Do you think she gets bigger than that
and then fleeing from talking with her

4173
01:56:57,391 --> 01:56:57,990
and uh,

4174
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,621
her manager,

4175
01:56:58,621 --> 01:56:59,454
her boyfriend,

4176
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:02,250
she walks around at one 85 Jesus used to,

4177
01:57:02,251 --> 01:57:03,084
she said,

4178
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:03,930
oh my God.

4179
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:04,630
She said,

4180
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:05,170
okay.

4181
01:57:05,170 --> 01:57:05,791
This one,

4182
01:57:05,791 --> 01:57:10,791
she's approaching UFC two 19 which
already happened at one 70 is down here.

4183
01:57:14,221 --> 01:57:16,740
They were talking what year is this?

4184
01:57:16,741 --> 01:57:18,150
Is this is at the end of last year.

4185
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:19,163
Interesting.

4186
01:57:20,350 --> 01:57:25,350
Now know before I used to walk around at
one 80 or 85 and now I'm walking around

4187
01:57:25,771 --> 01:57:28,710
at one 70 and it's very different than it.

4188
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:29,130
Oh,

4189
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:29,963
that's interesting.

4190
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,310
Then before when I was heavy,

4191
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:34,640
I'm getting to work more and more that.

4192
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:35,370
Okay,

4193
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:36,203
that makes sense.

4194
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,640
Once 70 he said,

4195
01:57:37,641 --> 01:57:39,480
I'm getting to work more and more.

4196
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:40,141
Getting light,

4197
01:57:40,141 --> 01:57:42,120
but I really have to be
on top of my weight now.

4198
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:45,450
So she's decided to stay on top of her
weight so she doesn't have to go through

4199
01:57:45,451 --> 01:57:46,500
so much of a brutal cut,

4200
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:47,730
which I think is very wise.

4201
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:50,010
One 70 is still a lot of weight.

4202
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:51,390
That's 25 pounds.

4203
01:57:51,391 --> 01:57:54,510
She fights at one 45 she's
the 145 pound champion,

4204
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:58,620
which means even right now she's
saying she doesn't cut as much,

4205
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:01,110
but she cuts 25 pounds.

4206
01:58:01,110 --> 01:58:01,770
Man.

4207
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:02,490
That's how,

4208
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:03,870
how big she is for the division.

4209
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:05,820
And I did Lockhart tips.

4210
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:07,290
Maybe it was dolce is one of those,

4211
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:07,981
wait,

4212
01:58:07,981 --> 01:58:08,430
come in.

4213
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:12,600
Which we're saying that it's tougher
for females that the weight cut gets

4214
01:58:12,601 --> 01:58:15,330
tougher and tougher because the adipose
tissue and stuff like that and their

4215
01:58:15,331 --> 01:58:16,000
hormones.

4216
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:16,440
Yeah,

4217
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,450
I think that was Lockhart.

4218
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:17,890
I don't,

4219
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:18,431
I don't remember.

4220
01:58:18,431 --> 01:58:21,370
I just be bro Science right now
we are pro science and all that,

4221
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:22,111
but I don't,

4222
01:58:22,111 --> 01:58:24,450
one of us know Jack Shit
about fat content thing,

4223
01:58:24,990 --> 01:58:26,010
especially when it comes to women.

4224
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:27,480
But I do think that,

4225
01:58:27,481 --> 01:58:27,930
um,

4226
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:28,350
you know,

4227
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:32,130
there's also unique struggles with women
when it's different times of the month.

4228
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:32,791
You know,

4229
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:33,750
women get bloated,

4230
01:58:33,751 --> 01:58:34,920
they retained water,

4231
01:58:34,921 --> 01:58:37,020
and sometimes it's hard
to get that water out.

4232
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:41,070
I have also talked to some women I've
dated in the past when and who do those

4233
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:42,160
who cut

4234
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,690
weight to not for fighting,

4235
01:58:43,691 --> 01:58:45,820
but for like bodybuilding
where they do bikini,

4236
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:46,091
right?

4237
01:58:46,091 --> 01:58:50,920
Her thyroids are fucked up
so then their body cut down,

4238
01:58:50,921 --> 01:58:51,371
but then it goes,

4239
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:51,701
oh shit,

4240
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:52,570
we don't do that again.

4241
01:58:52,571 --> 01:58:55,150
So it blows up and it's
trying to protect stuff.

4242
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:56,800
So weight cutting for women,

4243
01:58:56,890 --> 01:58:58,630
the high Maffra time
gets tougher and tougher.

4244
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:04,180
Row Science Hashtag Bro Science
ProSites bad for everybody,

4245
01:59:04,181 --> 01:59:04,570
man.

4246
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:05,440
It's not good for anybody.

4247
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:09,640
That's why cowboy at 70 I
like is 55 or so drawn out.

4248
01:59:09,641 --> 01:59:13,480
But then there's guys like
fucking till till you know,

4249
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,790
Wonderboy is fucking huge to like,

4250
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:17,463
dude,

4251
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,513
you know what we're about.

Mick and scary and he
swings to try to kill you.

4254
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:27,250
Here's the thing that scares me
about this fight with cowboy cal.

4255
01:59:27,251 --> 01:59:27,821
We needs this,

4256
01:59:27,821 --> 01:59:28,001
right?

4257
01:59:28,001 --> 01:59:30,250
He's a bit of a fork in
the road for first career.

4258
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:33,250
He's fighting a guy and Mike
Perry who's trained with his camp,

4259
01:59:33,251 --> 01:59:35,680
nobody knows cowboy better watch cab.

4260
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,200
We sparred more than people at Jackson's.

4261
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:38,820
Yeah.

4262
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:41,500
And can we needs this then there's the
whole thing with Mike [inaudible] and

4263
01:59:41,501 --> 01:59:44,310
John who's corner and
Perry against cowboy.

4264
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:46,540
Just a shit situation man.

4265
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:48,080
But it is for everybody.

4266
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:49,600
Just highly charged.

4267
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,650
It's highly charged.

4268
01:59:50,651 --> 01:59:51,370
But look,

4269
01:59:51,370 --> 01:59:53,010
both guys are there.

4270
01:59:53,330 --> 01:59:53,830
They're,

4271
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:55,750
it's a matchup that people want to say.

4272
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,021
You know,

4273
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:56,180
it's,

4274
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:57,540
it's a real crossroads match off.

4275
01:59:57,541 --> 01:59:58,420
I love the fight.

4276
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:03,160
It's a crossroads match up because if
a pirate Perry can't get past Robin or

4277
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:06,700
can't get past a Donald's Roney and
it puts him in this position where,

4278
02:00:06,730 --> 02:00:07,061
you know,

4279
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:07,451
he's,

4280
02:00:07,451 --> 02:00:08,284
um,

4281
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,513
he's learning,

4282
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:10,720
he's certainly getting better,

4283
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:12,730
but when it comes to
world class competition,

4284
02:00:12,731 --> 02:00:15,040
who's the most world class guy he's faced,

4285
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:18,400
but before it's Felder and fell just
really a 155 pounds daughters is best.

4286
02:00:18,401 --> 02:00:21,100
When he mentioned he was
hurt before that Potts,

4287
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:22,473
he lost.

4288
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,171
He lost that.

4289
02:00:23,171 --> 02:00:24,430
That's an old Jake Ellenberger.

4290
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:26,831
Unfortunately,

4291
02:00:26,831 --> 02:00:29,950
but it's still fucking stunning
the way he knocked him out.

4292
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:32,140
You realize that that kind of
older Jake Ellenberger for sure,

4293
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:35,590
but that elbow on the break
was legit as fuck dude.

4294
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:36,530
Cause then when you look at the guys,

4295
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:37,780
Alan Jobe and beat him,

4296
02:00:37,781 --> 02:00:38,230
right?

4297
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:39,260
So yeah,

4298
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:41,440
it should be by if this is
by far the toughest fight.

4299
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:42,970
I think this is his toughest fight,

4300
02:00:42,971 --> 02:00:44,680
but also they know each other.

4301
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:47,010
They've sparred together and um,

4302
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:47,920
I think that,

4303
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:48,341
but you know what?

4304
02:00:48,341 --> 02:00:49,490
I liked those.

4305
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:50,141
Sorry.

4306
02:00:50,141 --> 02:00:53,890
I think Donald thinks he
knows his tendencies and he
knows what he can do with

4307
02:00:53,891 --> 02:00:54,550
them.

4308
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:55,383
And um,

4309
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:56,380
you know,

4310
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:58,600
I think Donald has some
good times with them.

4311
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:01,640
They say when they grappled
Donald tuned him up.

4312
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:03,100
That's what I think Matt.

4313
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:06,640
And that's one of the things that Mike
Perry sad is that Donald's probably going

4314
02:01:06,641 --> 02:01:08,440
to try to grab a hold of
me and put me on my back.

4315
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,280
I'm holding me down.

4316
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,193
You know,

4317
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:11,590
it's,

4318
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:12,250
you can't,

4319
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:13,630
you can't discount this dude.

4320
02:01:13,631 --> 02:01:13,781
I mean,

4321
02:01:13,781 --> 02:01:14,980
he knocked out Matt Brown.

4322
02:01:14,981 --> 02:01:15,191
I mean,

4323
02:01:15,191 --> 02:01:19,210
this fucking combination that he did
to Rick story was preposterous to

4324
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:19,650
capitalism.

4325
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:21,550
One of the great that he's
just been doing it for a long,

4326
02:01:21,551 --> 02:01:22,830
long fucking time.

4327
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,460
And the way he did that Rick story went,

4328
02:01:24,461 --> 02:01:24,641
dude,

4329
02:01:24,641 --> 02:01:25,750
he's just touching him up.

4330
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:27,490
He's a touch scary thing about Donald's.

4331
02:01:27,491 --> 02:01:28,870
When Donald can be the bully,

4332
02:01:28,871 --> 02:01:30,340
he's gonna fuck you up.

4333
02:01:30,341 --> 02:01:33,850
But when someone draws a line in the
sand and starts going forward on Donald,

4334
02:01:33,851 --> 02:01:34,810
he struggles a little bit.

4335
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:36,310
Ideas fight.

4336
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:36,851
You know there,

4337
02:01:36,851 --> 02:01:37,684
there's some,

4338
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,320
the guys who don't play his games,

4339
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,040
Matt Brown,

4340
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,030
that was a tough fight for him.

4341
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:42,200
So he knocked him out.

4342
02:01:42,201 --> 02:01:43,190
That was a tough fucking fight.

4343
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:43,501
What was it,

4344
02:01:43,501 --> 02:01:44,630
Matt Brown's tough fight for anybody.

4345
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:45,051
Watch this.

4346
02:01:45,051 --> 02:01:45,680
Here it is.

4347
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,870
Here's that elbow boom son.

4348
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:48,561
I mean,

4349
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:50,570
he's got some fucking power,

4350
02:01:50,571 --> 02:01:51,404
man.

4351
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:52,670
He,

4352
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:54,050
he looked great against filter.

4353
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:54,820
He really did.

4354
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:55,250
He did.

4355
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:57,590
He didn't just look great
because fell to hurt his arm.

4356
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,180
He looked great because he looked great,

4357
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:00,950
but felt he did hurt his arm.

4358
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:01,700
But I mean,

4359
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:03,590
he took his arm off Mike Perry's head,

4360
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:06,500
that spinning back fist
leads to so many broken arms.

4361
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,250
Think about it.

4362
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:08,300
There's a lot of God.

4363
02:02:08,301 --> 02:02:08,571
Yeah,

4364
02:02:08,571 --> 02:02:12,320
you hit that forehead and Felder and I
were talking about it like he was like,

4365
02:02:12,321 --> 02:02:15,020
he's tries to kind of smash it with a,

4366
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:16,670
like a hammer fist.

4367
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:17,121
You know,

4368
02:02:17,121 --> 02:02:19,520
you try to catch a guy like
right at the end of it,

4369
02:02:19,521 --> 02:02:20,750
like sometimes,

4370
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:21,693
sometimes.

4371
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:24,230
And sometimes you hit
that fucking forehead.

4372
02:02:24,231 --> 02:02:25,790
Foreheads are so hard,

4373
02:02:25,791 --> 02:02:26,060
man.

4374
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:27,230
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

4375
02:02:27,231 --> 02:02:30,950
Cause Felder's a great commentator so
do that and quick and punch in the face.

4376
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,370
Um,

4377
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,560
he is a great commentator.

4378
02:02:32,561 --> 02:02:33,021
He's very,

4379
02:02:33,021 --> 02:02:34,880
very good spin together,

4380
02:02:34,881 --> 02:02:35,300
man.

4381
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:35,691
I was like,

4382
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:35,931
damn,

4383
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:38,300
this dude is smooth and professional.

4384
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,890
He loves the sport.

4385
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:41,330
He really does love the sport.

4386
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:41,541
You know,

4387
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:42,740
he's an acting major.

4388
02:02:42,741 --> 02:02:43,231
Theater majors.

4389
02:02:43,231 --> 02:02:43,341
Yeah,

4390
02:02:43,341 --> 02:02:44,390
he was a theater major,

4391
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:45,771
a smart guy.

4392
02:02:45,771 --> 02:02:47,000
He's very good at it.

4393
02:02:47,150 --> 02:02:47,871
But do it for the two.

4394
02:02:47,871 --> 02:02:48,560
Your fucking,

4395
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,460
he likes fighting.

4396
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:51,140
Of course he likes it.

4397
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,940
He's finding James Vick next,

4398
02:02:52,941 --> 02:02:53,421
which is a thing.

4399
02:02:53,421 --> 02:02:54,290
It's a very good fight.

4400
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:54,951
James Vick is,

4401
02:02:54,951 --> 02:02:56,340
I'll fucking big guy.

4402
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:57,251
His last one,

4403
02:02:57,251 --> 02:02:59,620
like his first big step up
for James Vick lost that.

4404
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:02,060
But James Vick and Paul
Felder's a great fight.

4405
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,340
That's a great fight to crazy fight.

4406
02:03:04,341 --> 02:03:04,850
Right?

4407
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:07,010
Isn't it pretty crazy fight.

4408
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:07,490
Yeah.

4409
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:09,260
I mean the big fight for James Vick,

4410
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:13,040
but well it's a big fight for both guys
fell this just coming off a loss and the

4411
02:03:13,041 --> 02:03:15,380
loss was like a last minute fight.

4412
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:16,160
I mean,

4413
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,911
I that's right.

4414
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:19,270
I think you only got like a couple
of weeks they switched it on.

4415
02:03:19,330 --> 02:03:19,650
Yeah.

4416
02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:20,271
Less than that.

4417
02:03:20,271 --> 02:03:20,600
Right.

4418
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:24,710
And he moved up to one 70 for that fight
instead of fighting at one 55 which,

4419
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:25,640
you know,

4420
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:25,901
uh,

4421
02:03:25,901 --> 02:03:29,750
I think if you're going to fight a
weight class above yours and you know,

4422
02:03:29,751 --> 02:03:31,970
you feel like it's the time
and you made the decision,

4423
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:32,781
that's great,

4424
02:03:32,781 --> 02:03:33,620
you should do that.

4425
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,270
But if you're not doing that,

4426
02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:39,950
if you plan to keep fighting at one
55 to take a fight in a larger way,

4427
02:03:39,951 --> 02:03:41,210
class is a big risk.

4428
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:43,160
And it take a fight against apple up.

4429
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:43,461
Yeah.

4430
02:03:43,461 --> 02:03:44,420
Against a real killer.

4431
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:45,350
Like Perry,

4432
02:03:45,351 --> 02:03:47,030
I think it's super dangerous.

4433
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:49,070
He's dangerous because he
hits like a seven year.

4434
02:03:49,071 --> 02:03:51,260
There's guys who were to take hates it,

4435
02:03:51,261 --> 02:03:53,080
but he couldn't hit like
a fucking middleweight.

4436
02:03:53,090 --> 02:03:53,420
Even.

4437
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:58,420
He hits fucking hard to real problems
and he takes it and you got to remember

4438
02:03:59,210 --> 02:04:01,460
cowboy has fought everybody.

4439
02:04:01,461 --> 02:04:01,881
Man.

4440
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:03,980
He's fought so many fucking people,

4441
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:04,911
you know.

4442
02:04:04,911 --> 02:04:06,270
And this is named MMA fighter.

4443
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:07,133
He's probably fine,

4444
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:07,700
man.

4445
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:08,210
Ever met.

4446
02:04:08,210 --> 02:04:10,220
And this is deep into his career.

4447
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:10,671
You know,

4448
02:04:10,671 --> 02:04:11,750
this is a real,

4449
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:13,880
like Darren till is a young,

4450
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:17,020
enormous welterweight
and cowboy lost to him.

4451
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:17,571
It's like damn,

4452
02:04:17,571 --> 02:04:19,780
how good is Darren till
Kelby lost Edwards too.

4453
02:04:19,781 --> 02:04:22,940
But if k to Leon Leon Edwards,

4454
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:23,630
that's right.

4455
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:24,820
He lost a decision decision.

4456
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:25,421
That was the one we,

4457
02:04:25,421 --> 02:04:26,630
he was sick as fuck though.

4458
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:27,940
And he almost pulled out of the fight.

4459
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:29,120
Still true.

4460
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:29,840
It's true.

4461
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,441
No doubt.

4462
02:04:30,441 --> 02:04:31,040
Look,

4463
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:31,671
no one's saying,

4464
02:04:31,671 --> 02:04:33,470
I'm not saying that this isn't a monster.

4465
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,640
No one's saying cowboys,

4466
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,290
a 20 year old guy who's at
the beginning of his career,

4467
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,970
he's been fighting a long time.

4468
02:04:38,971 --> 02:04:42,480
But I think you get a look at
a person from their last fight.

4469
02:04:42,481 --> 02:04:42,780
And you go,

4470
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,441
ah man,

4471
02:04:43,441 --> 02:04:44,191
he slept and like,

4472
02:04:44,191 --> 02:04:45,024
are you sure?

4473
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:45,661
Are you sure?

4474
02:04:45,661 --> 02:04:46,350
Because he,

4475
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:50,820
he might just be unmotivated or a lack
having a lack of discipline for this camp

4476
02:04:50,821 --> 02:04:52,650
or just find a really fucking good guy.

4477
02:04:52,651 --> 02:04:54,760
And Edward at 10 Darren till yes.

4478
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:55,201
Terrible.

4479
02:04:55,201 --> 02:04:58,550
Matchups farm until his win
was against the other cowboy,

4480
02:04:58,570 --> 02:04:59,450
the Brazilian Calloway,

4481
02:04:59,490 --> 02:04:59,760
right?

4482
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:00,180
Yeah.

4483
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:02,400
And Darrin tells such if
he asks him and Daryl,

4484
02:05:02,401 --> 02:05:02,671
sorry,

4485
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:03,450
Yancey materials,

4486
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:06,510
you can't keep him off you if you
can't clip him and keep you up to you.

4487
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,373
Yeah.

4488
02:05:07,410 --> 02:05:08,243
He's a nightmare.

4489
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:10,200
Fat Best One of the best in the world.

4490
02:05:10,290 --> 02:05:14,910
And this is one of the
things that highlights how
underrated Woodley strikings

4491
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:17,730
become because Woodley
knocked down both till,

4492
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:20,880
who started to be one of the best strikers
in the division and long and awkward

4493
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:23,330
and Wonderboy knocked dumb luck,

4494
02:05:23,331 --> 02:05:24,164
choked him out,

4495
02:05:24,670 --> 02:05:29,190
but not down Wonderboy in bolts of
their fights and had them all fucked up.

4496
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:31,080
Whereas neither one of
those guys hurt him.

4497
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:32,400
Neither one of those guys hit him.

4498
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,950
That's kind of crazy impressive too.

4499
02:05:34,951 --> 02:05:36,570
And doing rap albums and shit,

4500
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:37,400
I didn't hurt.

4501
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:38,090
Here's rap.

4502
02:05:38,090 --> 02:05:38,570
However,

4503
02:05:38,570 --> 02:05:39,140
was it good?

4504
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:39,930
Was Khalifa?

4505
02:05:39,930 --> 02:05:40,501
Uh,

4506
02:05:40,501 --> 02:05:40,770
yeah.

4507
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:41,041
I mean,

4508
02:05:41,041 --> 02:05:41,760
yeah,

4509
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,593
for sure.

4510
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:43,130
Have you heard of?

4511
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:43,800
To me?

4512
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,633
No,

4513
02:05:44,650 --> 02:05:45,690
it's not bad.

4514
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:46,530
You know,

4515
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:50,970
he got upset that we were talking
about cm punk and I was saying that,

4516
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:51,600
uh,

4517
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:52,433
that cm,

4518
02:05:52,460 --> 02:05:52,890
that,

4519
02:05:52,890 --> 02:05:54,360
that what does that Logan,

4520
02:05:54,361 --> 02:05:54,991
Paul Logan,

4521
02:05:54,991 --> 02:05:55,824
Paul character,

4522
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:56,693
the guy.

4523
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:58,380
You're right about that.

4524
02:05:58,470 --> 02:05:59,221
Is that what you said?

4525
02:05:59,221 --> 02:05:59,730
Yes.

4526
02:05:59,730 --> 02:06:00,563
I said

4527
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:02,280
why?

4528
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:05,910
Because Logan Paul wrestling
high school cm punk did not also,

4529
02:06:05,911 --> 02:06:07,440
I was looking at his boxing match.

4530
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:09,360
I was looking the way
chains punches together.

4531
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:09,810
He can,

4532
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:10,640
he's athletic.

4533
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:10,841
Yeah,

4534
02:06:10,841 --> 02:06:11,371
he could punch.

4535
02:06:11,371 --> 02:06:12,510
So if you're in allow cm punk,

4536
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:13,530
the fight in the UFC,

4537
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:14,670
that was on my own.

4538
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:17,370
That was all my point was my
point wasn't the cm punk is bad.

4539
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:20,430
And I think that cm punk is
actually a very brave guy.

4540
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:21,210
I think he's,

4541
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:22,500
that's a powerful thing to do,

4542
02:06:22,501 --> 02:06:23,151
to take a chance.

4543
02:06:23,151 --> 02:06:24,390
I can publicly,

4544
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:25,293
yeah,

4545
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:26,363
how dare you.

4546
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:30,150
But I mean anyone's brain
talking shit about him,

4547
02:06:30,151 --> 02:06:31,110
but I'm most certainly not.

4548
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:31,351
No,

4549
02:06:31,351 --> 02:06:32,280
he's a teammate.

4550
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:33,000
It's awesome.

4551
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,601
I get it.

4552
02:06:33,601 --> 02:06:35,340
He loves TMZ show,

4553
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:35,760
SAT,

4554
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,140
gets ratings to Willie,

4555
02:06:37,141 --> 02:06:38,000
knows how to play the game.

4556
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:39,300
I'm thinking he loves the guy too,

4557
02:06:39,430 --> 02:06:41,160
which I respect.

4558
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:41,641
And if you go,

4559
02:06:41,641 --> 02:06:42,140
Hey Logan,

4560
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:43,320
Paul can beat up your boy.

4561
02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:44,280
I don't even know if he could.

4562
02:06:44,281 --> 02:06:45,420
I don't know if they're even the same way.

4563
02:06:45,610 --> 02:06:47,610
Tony fucking a lot bigger.

4564
02:06:47,790 --> 02:06:49,420
I have no idea how big it Logan Paul,

4565
02:06:49,421 --> 02:06:50,031
he's the Youtuber,

4566
02:06:50,031 --> 02:06:50,760
so I don't know.

4567
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:51,511
Like someone said,

4568
02:06:51,511 --> 02:06:53,980
he fought at 185 pounds
and his boxing match,

4569
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:55,500
but they cut any weight though,

4570
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:55,820
right?

4571
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:57,960
It's he that pig when 85 he's a big fella.

4572
02:06:58,160 --> 02:06:58,550
His,

4573
02:06:58,550 --> 02:06:59,780
he has a little brother too.

4574
02:06:59,781 --> 02:07:01,020
He's calling out like Dell,

4575
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:01,801
Dylan Dannis,

4576
02:07:01,801 --> 02:07:02,580
which is silly.

4577
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:02,671
Oh,

4578
02:07:02,671 --> 02:07:03,480
that's hilarious.

4579
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:04,141
That's hilarious.

4580
02:07:04,141 --> 02:07:05,420
And then he goes out when people go,

4581
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:06,040
ah,

4582
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:06,340
you know,

4583
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:07,770
Dylan's a worldclass just the guy goes,

4584
02:07:07,950 --> 02:07:08,111
no,

4585
02:07:08,111 --> 02:07:08,181
no,

4586
02:07:08,181 --> 02:07:08,241
no,

4587
02:07:08,241 --> 02:07:08,311
no,

4588
02:07:08,311 --> 02:07:09,144
not Jujitsu.

4589
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:10,120
Just box it.

4590
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:11,020
It's good.

4591
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:11,760
Yeah.

4592
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,660
He just doesn't know.

4593
02:07:12,690 --> 02:07:13,081
Oh Shit.

4594
02:07:13,081 --> 02:07:13,950
It's about to go down,

4595
02:07:13,951 --> 02:07:14,220
dude.

4596
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:16,790
Mike Perry is in the cage
and cowboys walking that boy,

4597
02:07:16,791 --> 02:07:19,320
you always look so nervous
when he fights in Denver.

4598
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:21,330
He was 86 kilograms flat,

4599
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,193
whatever that is.

4600
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:24,180
86 kilograms.

4601
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:25,223
What is that?

4602
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:26,970
Is that a hundred that's 160 something,

4603
02:07:26,971 --> 02:07:27,690
right?

4604
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:28,523
I don't know.

4605
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:33,560
I a twice one 89.5 so he's way bigger
than cm punk will see you playing cause

4606
02:07:34,531 --> 02:07:36,100
pilot 70 cut weight.

4607
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:37,580
Those guys didn't cut.

4608
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:41,080
Well he might be cm park might
be in the one eight nine range.

4609
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:42,400
Logan Paul definitely is.

4610
02:07:42,430 --> 02:07:43,240
Why the ground?

4611
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:45,110
Paul is a fighter and 70 yeah.

4612
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,780
There's nothing wrong saying that.

4613
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:50,110
He probably weighs like probably one 80
or something because Santa one seven if

4614
02:07:50,111 --> 02:07:50,740
you had a guest,

4615
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:51,890
cm punk Adh.

4616
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:54,580
What is 91 92 I believe that.

4617
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:56,020
So it's WWE.

4618
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:57,340
It's 20 pounds.

4619
02:07:57,710 --> 02:07:58,421
Probably not.

4620
02:07:58,421 --> 02:08:00,730
Probably actually now it's
probably UFC information.

4621
02:08:00,990 --> 02:08:01,823
Yeah.

4622
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:02,920
What are your fights out?

4623
02:08:02,921 --> 02:08:03,140
Well,

4624
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:04,150
does he competes?

4625
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:07,210
He might be cutting weight from
one 90 which is not outrageous.

4626
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:09,010
So Logan Paul's way younger,

4627
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:10,300
little lot younger.

4628
02:08:10,301 --> 02:08:11,134
Vibrant.

4629
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:11,681
Well,

4630
02:08:11,681 --> 02:08:12,514
it's more,

4631
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:13,240
you know,

4632
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:18,150
it's one thing if it was Melvin
Manhoef fit 36 you know a guy.

4633
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:18,401
Yeah.

4634
02:08:18,401 --> 02:08:19,150
But you know what I'm saying?

4635
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:22,600
It's like it's not just being
36 it's learning later in life.

4636
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:27,610
You know there's a thing about striking
if you're not an explosive person and

4637
02:08:27,611 --> 02:08:29,260
you learned later in life,

4638
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:29,770
man,

4639
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:31,480
it seems like it's really difficult.

4640
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:35,020
The people that seem to pick it up or
people had a little bit of it when they

4641
02:08:35,021 --> 02:08:35,854
were younger,

4642
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,970
like a little bit of karate,

4643
02:08:36,971 --> 02:08:37,840
little bit of boxing,

4644
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:41,230
and they kind of kept the understanding
of their head and then as they retire

4645
02:08:41,231 --> 02:08:42,040
from other sports,

4646
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:43,120
then they start to do it.

4647
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:44,470
Was that the case with you?

4648
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:45,180
A little bit?

4649
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:45,611
A little bit.

4650
02:08:45,611 --> 02:08:46,060
Did you,

4651
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:50,320
were you doing any amateur boxing matches
or anything like that while you were

4652
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:52,210
doing football before
you're doing football?

4653
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,440
I was doing some Jujitsu.

4654
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:54,363
Jujitsu.

4655
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:56,530
When did you like get
heavily into striking?

4656
02:08:58,270 --> 02:08:59,740
Mm,

4657
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:03,520
I would do it to stay in shape during
the football season was before the

4658
02:09:03,521 --> 02:09:04,810
ultimate final for the ultimate.

4659
02:09:04,811 --> 02:09:05,440
How much,

4660
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:06,730
how much striking had you done?

4661
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,470
A just a golden gloves,

4662
02:09:08,471 --> 02:09:09,790
but I had six months of training.

4663
02:09:09,940 --> 02:09:10,601
Six months.

4664
02:09:10,601 --> 02:09:13,230
Six months of bucks and yeah,

4665
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,860
see like now think about,

4666
02:09:14,861 --> 02:09:15,041
Whoa,

4667
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:15,880
look at this Mike Perry.

4668
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:17,640
And facing them bowed to him.

4669
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:18,910
Let me that mean face.

4670
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:19,270
He's,

4671
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:20,710
he looks like almost like,

4672
02:09:20,711 --> 02:09:21,040
uh,

4673
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:21,490
like,

4674
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:22,150
like a,

4675
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:26,360
a devil type character in a movie he
looks like under Laski miniature size

4676
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:27,413
heading mean.

4677
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:28,390
So mean.

4678
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:28,860
He looks,

4679
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:29,350
he looks,

4680
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:31,460
he's probably one of the meanest
looking dudes in the spores.

4681
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:31,720
It,

4682
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:32,950
he's intense look and dude,

4683
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:34,060
so mean looking.

4684
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:34,750
Yeah.

4685
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:36,640
He's becoming more and
more comfortable to,

4686
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:37,090
you know,

4687
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:40,280
that's what you're seeing from him now
to this is this so much pressure on the

4688
02:09:40,281 --> 02:09:40,511
cow.

4689
02:09:40,511 --> 02:09:41,380
Much measure.

4690
02:09:41,590 --> 02:09:44,440
I just so much I liked my pay,

4691
02:09:44,441 --> 02:09:46,300
but copies of personal friends.

4692
02:09:46,301 --> 02:09:47,320
I'm rooting for cowboy.

4693
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:48,850
I feel exactly the same way.

4694
02:09:49,150 --> 02:09:49,720
I uh,

4695
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:49,870
I'm,

4696
02:09:49,870 --> 02:09:51,430
I love watching frank with cowboy,

4697
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:54,160
but I love Mike Perry to easily look,

4698
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:56,200
no matter what happens,

4699
02:09:56,650 --> 02:09:58,090
we're going to see a hell
of a fight right now.

4700
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:58,980
Hopefully.

4701
02:09:58,980 --> 02:09:59,170
Look,

4702
02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:00,820
I like cowboys do haircuts on,

4703
02:10:00,821 --> 02:10:01,481
I'm not mad at it.

4704
02:10:01,481 --> 02:10:03,970
Kind of a little crazy.

4705
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:04,990
Shaved on the sides.

4706
02:10:04,991 --> 02:10:05,410
Right.

4707
02:10:05,410 --> 02:10:07,030
And Patch on the Tuck is Baird.

4708
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:08,313
Yeah.

4709
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:09,760
It looks like a savage,

4710
02:10:10,270 --> 02:10:10,930
you know cowboys,

4711
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:12,910
grandma's low savage in this fight.

4712
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:14,680
You know you're fighting a savage.

4713
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:16,840
You better look savage
to match the savage.

4714
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:17,440
Here we go.

4715
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:18,580
Look at these two.

4716
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:19,480
Whew.

4717
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:20,373
I know.

4718
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:21,300
Me Too.

4719
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:23,510
I'm a terrible bite to make me nervous.

4720
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:24,640
Have a super angry.

4721
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:25,091
Yeah,

4722
02:10:25,091 --> 02:10:25,810
he does.

4723
02:10:25,810 --> 02:10:28,300
You think cowboy flips off
a Winkeljohn three wins.

4724
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:29,690
I don't know if he does.

4725
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:31,830
Let's say hey had kicked kv.

4726
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:32,741
Maybe there might be.

4727
02:10:32,741 --> 02:10:34,400
So that's cowboy dude or something.

4728
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,910
Since I've known cowboys hate Winkeljohn
and that'd be something to it.

4729
02:10:37,911 --> 02:10:39,080
Let's see what happens here.

4730
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:39,801
Damn.

4731
02:10:39,801 --> 02:10:40,760
He looks disciplined.

4732
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:43,220
Look at Mike Perez striking hands up.

4733
02:10:43,221 --> 02:10:44,780
High light on the fool.

4734
02:10:44,781 --> 02:10:45,141
Shit.

4735
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:49,370
He trying to knock them out
big right hand you the cowboys.

4736
02:10:49,371 --> 02:10:50,181
A slow starter.

4737
02:10:50,181 --> 02:10:50,760
So if,

4738
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,100
if I'm Mike Paris coach,

4739
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:55,030
I know Greg to the elbow
off the brake cowboy.

4740
02:10:55,031 --> 02:10:56,360
He's fucking good in the clinch Dell.

4741
02:10:57,860 --> 02:10:58,401
Damn.

4742
02:10:58,401 --> 02:10:58,940
Let's see here.

4743
02:10:58,940 --> 02:11:00,140
Well that's the thing about cowboy,

4744
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:01,880
surprisingly good wrestling.

4745
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:02,770
He fucks people up.

4746
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:03,321
The Dude,

4747
02:11:03,321 --> 02:11:06,910
I've seen him fucking amazing forgetful
and they forget because he's got picked

4748
02:11:06,911 --> 02:11:07,670
that he does here.

4749
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:08,481
That's amazing.

4750
02:11:08,481 --> 02:11:10,940
He lifts his left arm and
me picks dudes all the time.

4751
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:11,691
Well,

4752
02:11:11,691 --> 02:11:12,620
he also like,

4753
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:13,431
he's been,

4754
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:14,660
that does a nice knee to the body.

4755
02:11:14,661 --> 02:11:15,494
That shit was sharp.

4756
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:17,510
I'll cowboy sit trade with you all day.

4757
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:18,831
But Paris,

4758
02:11:18,831 --> 02:11:20,090
and he was very good as well though.

4759
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,553
But um,

4760
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:24,740
see the thing about cowboy is he's like a,

4761
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:26,900
he seems like a fun guy,

4762
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:27,380
right?

4763
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:31,700
He's always partying in and
driving around in his jet skiing,

4764
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:34,370
getting wild and jumped on
a plane and all that stuff.

4765
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:35,540
So people think,

4766
02:11:35,541 --> 02:11:35,691
oh,

4767
02:11:35,691 --> 02:11:36,650
this guy is just wild.

4768
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:39,380
He's also a seriously skilled fighter.

4769
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:40,200
God,

4770
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,910
a lot of that is a little
bit of a smokescreen.

4771
02:11:41,911 --> 02:11:42,230
He's a,

4772
02:11:42,230 --> 02:11:44,390
he's an absolutely an adrenaline junkie,

4773
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:46,130
but he's a very skilled fighter.

4774
02:11:46,131 --> 02:11:47,900
It looks unprofessional inside leg kick.

4775
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:48,940
Just lit up that enzyme.

4776
02:11:49,410 --> 02:11:50,590
And you do it from all angles.

4777
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:51,050
Yeah.

4778
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:51,590
And he'll look.

4779
02:11:51,590 --> 02:11:51,771
Yeah.

4780
02:11:51,771 --> 02:11:52,910
Has he had some rough fights?

4781
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:53,690
Yeah.

4782
02:11:53,690 --> 02:11:54,950
Against the best in the world though.

4783
02:11:55,010 --> 02:11:58,970
You're going to get that this is a
crazy ass fucking sport he's doing.

4784
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,040
It also has over 45 exactly.

4785
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:03,860
And you're throwing bones at
each other at a high velocity.

4786
02:12:03,861 --> 02:12:05,240
You're going to get some knockouts.

4787
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:06,170
You're going to give some,

4788
02:12:06,171 --> 02:12:07,010
you're going to get some,

4789
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:08,480
it's just part of the program.

4790
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:12,320
But cowboy look at that good head
room with their cowboys still here.

4791
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:13,490
Do you feel African?

4792
02:12:13,730 --> 02:12:15,530
Because callow Tim,

4793
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:19,820
he's biting his mouthpiece and just
going forward cause cowboys fucking tall.

4794
02:12:19,821 --> 02:12:21,590
I thought Perry was a
lot shorter compared.

4795
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:23,090
He's fucking bitch.

4796
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:24,230
I think he's six feet tall.

4797
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:25,910
Jesus tank too,

4798
02:12:25,911 --> 02:12:26,180
man.

4799
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:27,013
He's a tank.

4800
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:28,880
He's a real thick dude man.

4801
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:31,280
When you stub his girl in
his corner and he lost,

4802
02:12:31,281 --> 02:12:31,491
he's like,

4803
02:12:31,491 --> 02:12:31,791
you don't what?

4804
02:12:31,791 --> 02:12:32,391
Pregnant anymore,

4805
02:12:32,391 --> 02:12:33,050
Huh?

4806
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:35,030
Well you know he was on campus hat off.

4807
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:38,690
He can't make 55 fuck cal cal cowboy,

4808
02:12:38,691 --> 02:12:39,230
Ken.

4809
02:12:39,230 --> 02:12:39,561
God,

4810
02:12:39,561 --> 02:12:41,210
it's stuff on Kelly as he gets older too.

4811
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:41,750
Yeah.

4812
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:44,420
I mean maybe Perry can
make 55 maybe I'm wrong.

4813
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:47,030
Maybe you can kill himself and get
to like rumble Johnson used to do.

4814
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:50,440
He looks great at 70 dam
that will help her get up,

4815
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:51,530
get the fucking scared.

4816
02:12:51,531 --> 02:12:51,921
It's good.

4817
02:12:51,921 --> 02:12:54,650
But he's doing it on the outside and
Donald's slipping away from it now.

4818
02:12:54,651 --> 02:12:55,580
They sparred a lot,

4819
02:12:55,581 --> 02:12:59,090
a lot before they did a lot of sparring
with walking kind of fucked up.

4820
02:12:59,091 --> 02:12:59,191
I,

4821
02:12:59,191 --> 02:13:02,630
it's like when I filed a hundred
Laski we sparked a bunch together.

4822
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:06,440
So when we fought you're super tender
cause you knew what the guy was good at so

4823
02:13:06,441 --> 02:13:08,150
you wouldn't throw your normal shit.

4824
02:13:08,410 --> 02:13:09,890
So it makes for a more boring fight.

4825
02:13:09,891 --> 02:13:12,380
Sometimes in cowboys side though,

4826
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:16,340
I think psychologically it probably helps
him cause he's already fought this guy

4827
02:13:16,341 --> 02:13:18,980
before and if he did get the
better of him been training,

4828
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:21,110
it doesn't mean you're dealing
with the same Mike Perry.

4829
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,910
I'm sure Mike Perry is way better now.

4830
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:26,900
But if they did train together and
cowboy did get the best of them,

4831
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:30,080
then that shit's probably on
both of their minds right now.

4832
02:13:30,110 --> 02:13:31,380
There's just no way it's not.

4833
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:34,020
And that's a psychological
edge that cowboy would like.

4834
02:13:34,021 --> 02:13:34,290
Dude,

4835
02:13:34,290 --> 02:13:36,960
Oh side can travel is nasty off his past.

4836
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:41,880
He reminds me a lot of Anthony Pettis
off his back where they're so explosive.

4837
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,400
Even if you know what triangles come in,

4838
02:13:43,401 --> 02:13:44,940
there's fucking the really,

4839
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:45,810
really sneaky man.

4840
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:45,991
Well,

4841
02:13:45,991 --> 02:13:46,501
let's see,

4842
02:13:46,501 --> 02:13:47,910
because I can see those can
be tough to do anything.

4843
02:13:47,911 --> 02:13:49,680
This is not somewhere he wants to be.

4844
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:51,510
Let's see how he gets
out of this stuff is,

4845
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,410
I don't think it will take this all day.

4846
02:13:55,430 --> 02:13:56,270
Oh,

4847
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:57,720
that was beautiful.

4848
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:57,930
Yeah.

4849
02:13:57,930 --> 02:13:58,740
I encourage the tape.

4850
02:13:58,740 --> 02:13:59,760
Oh my God.

4851
02:13:59,761 --> 02:14:00,750
That was beautiful.

4852
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:01,613
That was beautiful.

4853
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:03,031
Smash him.

4854
02:14:03,031 --> 02:14:03,900
He can go to mount though.

4855
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:07,200
But this is the thing that Mike Perry was
saying that he would do that to him in

4856
02:14:07,201 --> 02:14:09,510
the gym and cowboys doing
it to him right now.

4857
02:14:09,710 --> 02:14:11,460
She cowboys super confident here.

4858
02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:12,810
Cal with grappling.

4859
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:13,381
Phenomenal.

4860
02:14:13,381 --> 02:14:14,011
It's phenomenal.

4861
02:14:14,011 --> 02:14:15,090
But not only got that look,

4862
02:14:15,091 --> 02:14:15,331
trap,

4863
02:14:15,331 --> 02:14:15,661
that arm,

4864
02:14:15,661 --> 02:14:17,760
he's being sock him in the fucking face.

4865
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,770
Torture in this guy for years.

4866
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:20,370
Right?

4867
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:21,090
Or for,

4868
02:14:21,090 --> 02:14:21,481
well,

4869
02:14:21,481 --> 02:14:22,030
not years.

4870
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:23,130
Maybe a few weeks,

4871
02:14:23,190 --> 02:14:23,940
a couple of weeks,

4872
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:24,511
maybe a few.

4873
02:14:24,511 --> 02:14:24,820
Sudanese.

4874
02:14:24,820 --> 02:14:25,980
He has him crucified.

4875
02:14:25,981 --> 02:14:26,770
Right.

4876
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:27,120
Years.

4877
02:14:27,120 --> 02:14:27,870
I made that up,

4878
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:28,560
but he couldn't.

4879
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:33,240
When he is doing though is exercising
some serious confidence in [inaudible].

4880
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,173
See this?

4881
02:14:34,270 --> 02:14:34,551
Look it.

4882
02:14:34,551 --> 02:14:35,280
He lost it though.

4883
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,120
He lost a position.

4884
02:14:36,510 --> 02:14:37,080
He lost it.

4885
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:37,711
He's on his back.

4886
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:39,900
So this isn't a path for cowboy?

4887
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:40,320
No.

4888
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,070
Oh,

4889
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:41,370
great.

4890
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:42,201
Has a great guard,

4891
02:14:42,201 --> 02:14:42,441
man.

4892
02:14:42,441 --> 02:14:43,500
It seems pretty good so far.

4893
02:14:43,530 --> 02:14:43,771
Yeah.

4894
02:14:43,771 --> 02:14:43,921
No,

4895
02:14:43,921 --> 02:14:45,690
he's got his guard attacking and he's,

4896
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:48,120
he looks like he's trying to
bait them with the right arm.

4897
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:48,601
Cowboys,

4898
02:14:48,601 --> 02:14:49,190
triangles.

4899
02:14:49,190 --> 02:14:50,310
Fucking filthy man.

4900
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,660
How needed the ass pipe?

4901
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,170
Where are you allowed to hit back,

4902
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:54,980
back there,

4903
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:55,391
everything.

4904
02:14:55,391 --> 02:14:56,160
Anything goes.

4905
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,110
Anything but the zones
hit the scroll them.

4906
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:00,180
But you're kinda hitting
super closest snack.

4907
02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:02,880
It's like you're hitting this tastes
like the house next door to you getting

4908
02:15:02,881 --> 02:15:03,630
bombed on.

4909
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:04,021
Look at this.

4910
02:15:04,021 --> 02:15:07,230
Armbar attempt always spikes him
and he's gonna break his arm.

4911
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,340
He's got to host breaking his arm.

4912
02:15:08,341 --> 02:15:08,511
Done it.

4913
02:15:08,511 --> 02:15:08,710
No,

4914
02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:10,170
he's passing over and he's passing over.

4915
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:10,360
Oh,

4916
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:12,690
cowboys breaking his fucking arm.

4917
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:14,643
Fuck yeah.

4918
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,170
Fuck yeah.

4919
02:15:16,170 --> 02:15:17,250
That's a wrap son.

4920
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:17,850
Fuck yeah.

4921
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:18,683
Cowboy.

4922
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:19,610
Do y'all take him?

4923
02:15:19,610 --> 02:15:21,030
Show him with that is for cowboy.

4924
02:15:21,031 --> 02:15:22,700
Didn't take a shot and got an arm bar.

4925
02:15:23,050 --> 02:15:23,910
Didn't take a big shot.

4926
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:24,970
[inaudible] book.

4927
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:27,630
I like to come at me,

4928
02:15:27,631 --> 02:15:28,464
mother fucker.

4929
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:29,670
I love it.

4930
02:15:29,671 --> 02:15:29,960
This,

4931
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:30,870
leave this talking,

4932
02:15:30,871 --> 02:15:31,920
all that shit.

4933
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:33,600
You gotta appreciate it man.

4934
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:34,583
Dude,

4935
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:36,900
you get kicked out of your own gym.

4936
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:37,950
Here comes this kid too.

4937
02:15:37,951 --> 02:15:39,020
And just had a baby boy.

4938
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:41,600
I don't think that's what he's
doing on his wife to bring his kid,

4939
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:42,230
his kid.

4940
02:15:42,230 --> 02:15:43,310
That's tall,

4941
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:44,040
man.

4942
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:44,700
That's what it,

4943
02:15:44,700 --> 02:15:45,660
that's phenomenal.

4944
02:15:45,661 --> 02:15:46,860
It wasn't an anger thing.

4945
02:15:46,890 --> 02:15:48,030
That's phenomenal.

4946
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:48,391
That was,

4947
02:15:48,391 --> 02:15:50,400
he wants to sign a damn man.

4948
02:15:50,610 --> 02:15:50,791
Oh,

4949
02:15:50,791 --> 02:15:51,720
what a cute little fella.

4950
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:52,890
Wow,

4951
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:53,341
dude.

4952
02:15:53,341 --> 02:15:54,280
How happy sockeye.

4953
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:54,841
Wow.

4954
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:57,090
What a great frickin wind for cowboy.

4955
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:58,860
He looks so confident,

4956
02:15:58,861 --> 02:15:59,640
Dude.

4957
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:03,900
Look how confident he looked and I think
some of that is just to not just that

4958
02:16:03,901 --> 02:16:04,980
he's a really good fighter,

4959
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:07,170
but also that they've,

4960
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:08,430
they've sparked their familiar.

4961
02:16:08,431 --> 02:16:09,264
We had a number.

4962
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,313
He knew he had it.

4963
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:11,340
If it went to the ground,

4964
02:16:11,341 --> 02:16:12,810
especially dude,

4965
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:14,430
but he has no god.

4966
02:16:14,431 --> 02:16:15,370
That is cute.

4967
02:16:15,390 --> 02:16:15,961
Standing up.

4968
02:16:15,961 --> 02:16:16,870
He didn't get hit with it.

4969
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:17,970
No.

4970
02:16:17,970 --> 02:16:18,211
Yeah,

4971
02:16:18,211 --> 02:16:19,260
he's moving to it.

4972
02:16:19,261 --> 02:16:20,670
He looks smooth as fuck.

4973
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,890
He looked super polished standing up.

4974
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:24,470
What a big win for cal,

4975
02:16:24,471 --> 02:16:26,580
but he looks like he's got
to snap his fucking arm to,

4976
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:26,941
hey man,

4977
02:16:26,941 --> 02:16:27,691
he might've broke it.

4978
02:16:27,691 --> 02:16:28,530
We don't even know.

4979
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:28,831
I mean,

4980
02:16:28,831 --> 02:16:30,080
he was always bad English.

4981
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:30,790
Please.

4982
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:31,391
God Man,

4983
02:16:31,391 --> 02:16:32,230
very underrated.

4984
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:34,270
Get spiked to trap the leg.

4985
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:34,660
Nope.

4986
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:36,660
Spiking holds ever works
unless you rampage.

4987
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:38,200
I say 80 doesn't let go,

4988
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:40,870
turns him and then holds them belly down,

4989
02:16:40,871 --> 02:16:43,690
gets that arm and now when
he arches his back up like,

4990
02:16:43,691 --> 02:16:43,961
dude,

4991
02:16:43,961 --> 02:16:44,500
there's a,

4992
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:46,060
there's a ton of fucking torque.

4993
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:47,313
Look at this.

4994
02:16:47,710 --> 02:16:48,900
That arm is in trouble and it's,

4995
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:50,300
we get cowboy sideways.

4996
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:51,980
It might've been examined right there,

4997
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:52,511
dude.

4998
02:16:52,511 --> 02:16:53,860
His arm might've went sideways.

4999
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:54,761
Look at this again.

5000
02:16:54,761 --> 02:16:55,780
Look at this from this angle.

5001
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:57,400
Like look at where the arm is.

5002
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:58,293
He was our intern.

5003
02:16:58,310 --> 02:16:58,920
Yeah,

5004
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:01,840
look at where his arm is though
is it's almost like he's doing it.

5005
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:04,870
He's getting it like this
way and Torque in it.

5006
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:05,111
Yeah,

5007
02:17:05,111 --> 02:17:09,700
he's gay way joint manipulation
and he's not getting it like this.

5008
02:17:09,701 --> 02:17:11,940
It looked like he wasn't getting it
like this straightened out my grade.

5009
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:12,771
Like to the side.

5010
02:17:12,771 --> 02:17:14,140
It looked like it was almost like this.

5011
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,490
That will rip your shit apart,

5012
02:17:15,491 --> 02:17:16,120
man.

5013
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:16,953
That's tremendous.

5014
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:18,023
Ooh,

5015
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:20,350
big way again,

5016
02:17:20,351 --> 02:17:23,420
this nothing I liked Mike Perry
has nothing to do with like I do.

5017
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,730
I just know taboos career,

5018
02:17:24,731 --> 02:17:25,564
what he's been through.

5019
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:26,770
He had a baby,

5020
02:17:26,890 --> 02:17:28,540
he gets kid kicked out of his gym,

5021
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:29,590
his back's against the wall,

5022
02:17:29,591 --> 02:17:30,580
he loses this one.

5023
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:33,910
Everyone's telling him to retire
like it's fucking Donald Cerrone,

5024
02:17:33,911 --> 02:17:34,270
man.

5025
02:17:34,270 --> 02:17:34,481
Look,

5026
02:17:34,481 --> 02:17:35,314
God damn good too.

5027
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:38,860
And the fact that he
came to them and said,

5028
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:39,560
hey,

5029
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:41,500
I don't think it's fair that
you guys train this guy,

5030
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:42,480
you know,

5031
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:43,480
which doesn't make any sense.

5032
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,000
We've been,

5033
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,160
we've been together forever.

5034
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:46,150
And they said,

5035
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:46,541
okay,

5036
02:17:46,541 --> 02:17:48,370
well we're going to talk it
through and have a meeting.

5037
02:17:48,371 --> 02:17:49,510
And then they come back after the meeting.

5038
02:17:49,511 --> 02:17:50,344
Oh yeah,

5039
02:17:50,370 --> 02:17:51,071
I'm going to train him.

5040
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:52,030
You can't come here anymore.

5041
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:53,470
So fucked up.

5042
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:54,280
And then,

5043
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:56,460
but also would have him win the,

5044
02:17:56,550 --> 02:17:58,450
the interesting thing too is,

5045
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:01,930
you know cowboy Daigo is Greg Jackson
and according to next week he goes,

5046
02:18:01,931 --> 02:18:02,200
yeah,

5047
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:03,840
just not this one to just see this shit.

5048
02:18:03,870 --> 02:18:04,241
The movie,

5049
02:18:04,241 --> 02:18:05,350
like what is it called?

5050
02:18:05,351 --> 02:18:06,190
Overlord dude.

5051
02:18:06,191 --> 02:18:07,990
This shit looks so good.

5052
02:18:08,010 --> 02:18:09,310
Seeing tons of people talk about it today.

5053
02:18:09,311 --> 02:18:09,491
I said,

5054
02:18:09,491 --> 02:18:10,210
it's really good.

5055
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:10,331
Oh,

5056
02:18:10,331 --> 02:18:11,870
is it out already this weekend?

5057
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:12,753
Oh my God,

5058
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,120
a video game right now.

5059
02:18:14,130 --> 02:18:14,860
I don't think it hasn't.

5060
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:15,521
I think so.

5061
02:18:15,521 --> 02:18:16,300
Dude.

5062
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:17,133
Am I crazy?

5063
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:20,470
I'm thinking of Wolfenstein definitely
could have been a video game.

5064
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:20,980
Fuck yeah,

5065
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,840
it might be a bit of good.

5066
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:22,683
I'm still,

5067
02:18:22,900 --> 02:18:23,621
if it's not,

5068
02:18:23,621 --> 02:18:24,281
they fucked up.

5069
02:18:24,281 --> 02:18:25,260
I remember that time.

5070
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:26,980
Make it a video game with the release.

5071
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:29,020
I know people would play
the shit out of that.

5072
02:18:29,710 --> 02:18:31,120
I was balls deep in Wolfenstein.

5073
02:18:31,121 --> 02:18:31,521
As a kid,

5074
02:18:31,521 --> 02:18:34,390
imagine what has to come into
place to make a video game.

5075
02:18:34,630 --> 02:18:36,490
Like imagine if you
have a movie and you go,

5076
02:18:36,491 --> 02:18:36,701
man,

5077
02:18:36,701 --> 02:18:38,380
we've got to make a video
game to get this movie.

5078
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:39,790
Like to come out with it.

5079
02:18:39,791 --> 02:18:40,930
It'd be the perfect video game.

5080
02:18:41,110 --> 02:18:41,680
What is it?

5081
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:42,730
Overlord film review.

5082
02:18:42,731 --> 02:18:45,220
Great video game movie that's
not based on a video game.

5083
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:49,840
That's funny.

5084
02:18:51,010 --> 02:18:52,330
I figured it was the video game.

5085
02:18:52,331 --> 02:18:53,200
The name overlord.

5086
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:57,130
The poster looks like two fucking
Wolfenstein so ridiculously fun.

5087
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:57,700
That's funny.

5088
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:58,660
That's so funny.

5089
02:18:58,750 --> 02:18:59,351
That's so funny.

5090
02:18:59,351 --> 02:19:00,340
It hurts my feelings.

5091
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:01,991
Yeah,

5092
02:19:01,991 --> 02:19:02,171
man.

5093
02:19:02,171 --> 02:19:02,950
That's what it seemed like.

5094
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:03,970
It seemed like a video game.

5095
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:05,350
A hundred percent dude,

5096
02:19:05,351 --> 02:19:06,490
look at cowboy.

5097
02:19:06,491 --> 02:19:07,324
He's so happy.

5098
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:09,460
How can you not be your son's?

5099
02:19:09,461 --> 02:19:12,490
They're chewing on monster
can shout out the monster.

5100
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:15,260
Don't let the sun actually
get that monster system.

5101
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:15,750
Yeah.

5102
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:19,120
Now that would not be a match and that
he gets a hold of that and that's open

5103
02:19:19,121 --> 02:19:19,954
to,

5104
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:22,870
and it looks like a all's good in the end.

5105
02:19:23,410 --> 02:19:23,980
Wow.

5106
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:24,813
Beautiful.

5107
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:25,481
No,

5108
02:19:25,481 --> 02:19:25,661
no,

5109
02:19:25,661 --> 02:19:25,811
no.

5110
02:19:25,811 --> 02:19:26,644
That's okay.

5111
02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:27,470
That's okay.

5112
02:19:27,470 --> 02:19:28,101
I'll say hi to.

5113
02:19:28,101 --> 02:19:30,320
I want to see him and congratulate him.

5114
02:19:31,190 --> 02:19:31,951
He's an awesome dude.

5115
02:19:31,951 --> 02:19:33,560
What up in his hometown,

5116
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:34,160
man.

5117
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:35,120
So happy for him.

5118
02:19:35,610 --> 02:19:36,500
That was a stressful.

5119
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:37,371
Here's the thing though,

5120
02:19:37,371 --> 02:19:37,581
man.

5121
02:19:37,581 --> 02:19:38,251
He looked good.

5122
02:19:38,251 --> 02:19:39,084
His fuck.

5123
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:40,460
It wasn't just that he won,

5124
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:40,881
dude.

5125
02:19:40,881 --> 02:19:41,930
He look smooth.

5126
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:44,240
How about Paul Felder
trains at Jackson's too.

5127
02:19:44,241 --> 02:19:45,140
He knows what's going on.

5128
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:46,730
Most one with history.

5129
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:47,810
Paul's with Duke.

5130
02:19:48,010 --> 02:19:49,100
He was at Jackson's first.

5131
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:49,640
Yeah,

5132
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:50,473
before that.

5133
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:51,860
Before Duke did.

5134
02:19:51,861 --> 02:19:52,700
He loves Duke.

5135
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:54,860
He loves Duke.

5136
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:55,380
Okay.

5137
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:56,450
That powerful Joe Schilling,

5138
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:58,480
his grandma's shaking man.

5139
02:19:58,850 --> 02:19:59,460
Macdonald.

5140
02:19:59,460 --> 02:20:00,290
How cool it.

5141
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:01,820
Your son's so happy.

5142
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:03,650
Look how fucking happy he is.

5143
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:05,930
Look at that fucking animal.

5144
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,280
Love it.

5145
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,570
I wonder what Kelly's love it.

5146
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:09,561
Yeah,

5147
02:20:09,561 --> 02:20:10,010
he's a,

5148
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:11,180
he's a guy that like,

5149
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:11,690
man,

5150
02:20:11,690 --> 02:20:12,740
look at that resume.

5151
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:14,090
Cowboy Hall of Famer Man.

5152
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:14,740
Yeah,

5153
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:15,830
a hundred percent yeah.

5154
02:20:15,831 --> 02:20:16,670
He's got some big fights.

5155
02:20:16,671 --> 02:20:17,451
One big fights,

5156
02:20:17,451 --> 02:20:19,400
but most finishes in UFC history.

5157
02:20:19,401 --> 02:20:20,840
Most wins in UFC history.

5158
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:21,620
You're a hall of Famer.

5159
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:21,921
Yeah.

5160
02:20:21,921 --> 02:20:23,450
Even if he never wins a title,

5161
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:24,680
he's a hall of Famer.

5162
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:25,490
I agree.

5163
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:26,420
He's the one guy.

5164
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:27,590
I think he passes your eyes.

5165
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:28,970
The one guy who never went to title.

5166
02:20:28,971 --> 02:20:31,310
That shit becomes more popular too.

5167
02:20:31,730 --> 02:20:32,240
Yeah.

5168
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:32,780
Well you're right.

5169
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:34,700
You know your eyes when thinking
about getting back in there.

5170
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:37,220
No Games,

5171
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:38,410
pasture board,

5172
02:20:38,450 --> 02:20:39,170
man.

5173
02:20:39,170 --> 02:20:40,050
He has so much shit.

5174
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:44,300
You don't shut a movies healing
up and he's thinking about it.

5175
02:20:44,350 --> 02:20:44,640
Oh,

5176
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:45,191
that's about it.

5177
02:20:45,191 --> 02:20:45,830
Yeah.

5178
02:20:45,830 --> 02:20:46,670
How about the ditch?

5179
02:20:46,671 --> 02:20:47,480
The fly?

5180
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:49,100
This is super impressive man.

5181
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:51,920
But cowboy did super impressive
that he never let it go.

5182
02:20:52,060 --> 02:20:53,570
Like that was tight as shit.

5183
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:55,030
Dude slamming it's old school,

5184
02:20:55,031 --> 02:20:55,360
but yeah.

5185
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:55,540
Yeah,

5186
02:20:55,540 --> 02:20:58,670
but it's the way in the
transitions are sure to stay on it.

5187
02:20:58,730 --> 02:20:58,941
Yeah.

5188
02:20:58,941 --> 02:21:02,270
Because even when Mike was doing the
right thing by passing over the top,

5189
02:21:02,271 --> 02:21:03,530
it looked like he was almost out.

5190
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:07,250
But the risk control that he had the
cowboy hat and it keeping it in the

5191
02:21:07,251 --> 02:21:08,450
position where he wanted it,

5192
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:09,873
the squeeze.

5193
02:21:09,950 --> 02:21:10,783
I think there's a,

5194
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:11,571
like again,

5195
02:21:11,571 --> 02:21:14,520
him and Anthony Pettis are guys when it
goes to the ground because people think

5196
02:21:14,521 --> 02:21:15,980
of a miss knockout artist,

5197
02:21:15,981 --> 02:21:17,350
which they are and the great standing.

5198
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:21,320
But Anthony Pettis and him on the ground
are fucking tricky man from their back.

5199
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:23,030
Most people aren't from their back,

5200
02:21:23,031 --> 02:21:24,980
but Petterson him from
their back is nasty.

5201
02:21:24,981 --> 02:21:25,520
They both,

5202
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:27,620
they both dive on shit real quick too.

5203
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:29,120
Explosive Man.

5204
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:29,601
Yeah.

5205
02:21:29,601 --> 02:21:30,530
Well they basic stuff,

5206
02:21:30,531 --> 02:21:31,460
but it's explosive.

5207
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:33,300
Cowboys started off with Moy.

5208
02:21:33,301 --> 02:21:33,560
Tai.

5209
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:34,131
Look at this.

5210
02:21:34,131 --> 02:21:34,320
Yeah.

5211
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:34,861
A quick though.

5212
02:21:34,861 --> 02:21:35,031
This.

5213
02:21:35,031 --> 02:21:36,020
I was so pretty.

5214
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:37,810
[inaudible]

5215
02:21:38,750 --> 02:21:39,201
boom.

5216
02:21:39,201 --> 02:21:40,870
The slam and tightening.

5217
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:42,230
Look how's it's to see that.

5218
02:21:42,830 --> 02:21:43,700
Oh look how he's got that.

5219
02:21:43,701 --> 02:21:44,690
Like trapped in like that.

5220
02:21:44,691 --> 02:21:44,870
Yo,

5221
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:46,160
he's fucking that elbow up.

5222
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:46,551
Yeah.

5223
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:47,720
There was gonna be sore tomorrow.

5224
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:48,280
Oh,

5225
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:50,540
he had a tap like you were saying.

5226
02:21:50,770 --> 02:21:53,750
It's a tough loss for Mike Perry
because you want to see where he's at.

5227
02:21:53,751 --> 02:21:53,991
Right.

5228
02:21:53,991 --> 02:21:54,250
Cause the,

5229
02:21:54,250 --> 02:21:55,400
the guys that he's beat,

5230
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:56,870
you do see where he's at though?

5231
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:58,310
Donald's a step ahead of him.

5232
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,210
At least.

5233
02:21:59,210 --> 02:22:00,043
At least a step.

5234
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:01,063
Maybe more.

5235
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:01,910
Yes.

5236
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:02,450
You know Mike,

5237
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:06,230
but Mike Perry looked better than he's
ever looked before and he's just fighting

5238
02:22:06,231 --> 02:22:08,060
the guy who was the best
guys ever fought before.

5239
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:08,541
And when he,

5240
02:22:08,541 --> 02:22:09,610
Mike Perry moves in,

5241
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:11,330
he moves in with his hands up high.

5242
02:22:11,450 --> 02:22:13,910
His Chin's talk his techniques on point.

5243
02:22:13,930 --> 02:22:14,180
He look,

5244
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,080
he's not done.

5245
02:22:15,350 --> 02:22:16,970
He's not done.

5246
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:18,230
I don't even mean in his career.

5247
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:20,210
I mean it's progress is going to get,

5248
02:22:21,140 --> 02:22:24,350
he just got to Jackson
already from a beating.

5249
02:22:24,351 --> 02:22:25,184
Paul Felder.

5250
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:26,600
Keeman looked better in a,

5251
02:22:26,650 --> 02:22:28,560
in as a fighter against cowboy.

5252
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:29,700
So the next one,

5253
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:30,751
maybe you just don't give them,

5254
02:22:30,751 --> 02:22:31,110
uh,

5255
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:32,630
the caliber of cowboy.

5256
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:33,630
He's not there yet.

5257
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:33,940
Well,

5258
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:34,711
can you get there though?

5259
02:22:34,711 --> 02:22:35,790
Sleep on cowboy,

5260
02:22:35,791 --> 02:22:36,151
man.

5261
02:22:36,151 --> 02:22:36,984
They forget.

5262
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:38,730
They think for some reason he's done,

5263
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,080
but just because he got knocked out by
Darren till and then lost Leon Roberts.

5264
02:22:43,560 --> 02:22:45,120
Leon Roberts is a really good fighter.

5265
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:46,950
And he was a Roberts or Edwards.

5266
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,360
Did I say Edwards or Robert?

5267
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:48,991
I don't know.

5268
02:22:48,991 --> 02:22:49,950
Now I'm getting to weed.

5269
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:50,611
It is Edwards,

5270
02:22:50,611 --> 02:22:51,330
right?

5271
02:22:51,330 --> 02:22:51,871
It's Edwards.

5272
02:22:51,871 --> 02:22:52,470
Right?

5273
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:55,170
Leon Roberts or Edwards had
fought cowboy cowboys last fight.

5274
02:22:55,230 --> 02:22:56,063
Edwards.

5275
02:22:56,250 --> 02:22:56,581
Did I say,

5276
02:22:56,581 --> 02:22:57,414
I said Roberts.

5277
02:22:57,630 --> 02:22:59,370
It's all good to Tibet.

5278
02:22:59,510 --> 02:23:00,600
Sorry.

5279
02:23:01,510 --> 02:23:02,343
Yeah,

5280
02:23:02,730 --> 02:23:06,270
I got a contact high
dude doing sober October.

5281
02:23:06,271 --> 02:23:09,270
Did you get fucked up right away after?

5282
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,710
Sorry to Leon Edwards.

5283
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:11,550
Um,

5284
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:12,840
but my point was yeah,

5285
02:23:12,841 --> 02:23:15,450
we got fucked up big time
to get more fucked up now,

5286
02:23:15,451 --> 02:23:16,650
which took 30 days off.

5287
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:17,581
I don't think so.

5288
02:23:17,581 --> 02:23:18,570
It seems exactly the same.

5289
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:20,160
You on no nut November now?

5290
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:20,671
Uh,

5291
02:23:20,671 --> 02:23:20,881
no.

5292
02:23:20,881 --> 02:23:21,511
It's supposed to be no,

5293
02:23:21,511 --> 02:23:22,470
remember November?

5294
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:23,131
No,

5295
02:23:23,131 --> 02:23:23,581
it's no,

5296
02:23:23,581 --> 02:23:25,020
not November maybe.

5297
02:23:25,021 --> 02:23:25,950
And your weird camp.

5298
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,800
My fucking hell.

5299
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:28,780
Oh.

5300
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:30,510
Can we get together?

5301
02:23:31,180 --> 02:23:31,681
There was no,

5302
02:23:31,681 --> 02:23:31,930
no,

5303
02:23:31,930 --> 02:23:32,763
no.

5304
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:34,200
We're trying to get rid of these loads.

5305
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:37,330
Yeah.

5306
02:23:37,330 --> 02:23:38,041
Less loads.

5307
02:23:38,041 --> 02:23:38,790
December.

5308
02:23:38,790 --> 02:23:40,710
I remember hearing about tantric sex.

5309
02:23:41,570 --> 02:23:43,830
Tantric sex makes sex better and oh,

5310
02:23:43,831 --> 02:23:46,290
what is this crazy commercial people
to drive it wrapped or though,

5311
02:23:46,830 --> 02:23:47,580
look at that.

5312
02:23:47,580 --> 02:23:49,680
Forrest Griffin still
doing the damn thing,

5313
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:51,361
dude.

5314
02:23:51,361 --> 02:23:52,110
How bout uh,

5315
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:52,890
TJ verse.

5316
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:57,890
So Hutto but at 25 foot doesn't make sense
that it's going to be at 25 is really

5317
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:00,740
going to get rid of the
flyweight division there.

5318
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:01,410
Done.

5319
02:24:01,410 --> 02:24:02,400
That seems strange.

5320
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:03,180
Why do it?

5321
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:03,661
I know why.

5322
02:24:03,661 --> 02:24:04,620
When sue who don't come up,

5323
02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:06,410
because I guess Tj wants
to be a double champion.

5324
02:24:06,411 --> 02:24:07,350
That's the last fight.

5325
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:10,620
But it's a for a belt that's for
divisions not around anymore.

5326
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:11,100
Well,

5327
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:13,920
maybe they decided to do it because
the historical implications,

5328
02:24:13,921 --> 02:24:16,590
because if Tj can drop down and beat him,

5329
02:24:16,860 --> 02:24:19,080
he's the last champ champ.

5330
02:24:19,081 --> 02:24:21,090
And he wins the title in two divisions.

5331
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:24,270
Unless he wants to go up to 45 you know?

5332
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:25,830
And then if he does,

5333
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:29,940
I mean maybe he builds up after a while
and goes up to 45 for a few fights,

5334
02:24:31,110 --> 02:24:31,830
you know?

5335
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:32,161
Yeah.

5336
02:24:32,161 --> 02:24:32,994
Maybe.

5337
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:33,541
I mean,

5338
02:24:33,541 --> 02:24:34,770
you've got a whole lot for him.

5339
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:35,310
Well,

5340
02:24:35,310 --> 02:24:35,521
well,

5341
02:24:35,521 --> 02:24:36,480
there's some good fights for it.

5342
02:24:36,481 --> 02:24:37,890
45 for sure.

5343
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:40,290
Not 45 45 seat may a tough one for him.

5344
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:41,130
It's going to be tough.

5345
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:42,780
35 there's still some fights.

5346
02:24:43,020 --> 02:24:44,400
Marlin Mariah's is right there.

5347
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:45,360
Yeah,

5348
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:45,511
no,

5349
02:24:45,511 --> 02:24:46,080
I agree.

5350
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:46,950
Jimmy Rivera,

5351
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:48,020
just one is last one.

5352
02:24:48,021 --> 02:24:49,740
E five is his natural way class.

5353
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:52,290
But if he's working with that,

5354
02:24:52,291 --> 02:24:53,130
what's that guy's name?

5355
02:24:54,130 --> 02:24:55,770
What is his name?

5356
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:57,150
Alameda.

5357
02:24:57,150 --> 02:24:57,781
Is that his name?

5358
02:24:57,781 --> 02:24:59,310
I forget what his,

5359
02:24:59,311 --> 02:24:59,610
uh,

5360
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:02,400
he's marshaling Tj Dillashaw.

5361
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:03,390
Jamie searching for it.

5362
02:25:03,391 --> 02:25:04,224
He's got it in the

5363
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:11,550
God it I hate when that marijuana
clouds my memory and ruins my argument.

5364
02:25:11,580 --> 02:25:12,600
And I have marijuana.

5365
02:25:12,601 --> 02:25:13,560
They have no excuse.

5366
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:14,850
You got hotbox on.

5367
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:15,773
Oh there we go.

5368
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:16,650
Yeah,

5369
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:19,440
I'm contact I this stuff a
strong second hand smoke.

5370
02:25:20,070 --> 02:25:20,730
Um,

5371
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:21,451
but TJ versa,

5372
02:25:21,451 --> 02:25:22,290
who does a good fight though?

5373
02:25:22,291 --> 02:25:23,124
It's a very good fight.

5374
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:28,360
Can't find his strength and conditioning
coach didn't pop up right away.

5375
02:25:29,490 --> 02:25:30,220
It's all good.

5376
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:32,040
Sam Calavaro Kalvia yeah,

5377
02:25:32,130 --> 02:25:32,710
that's right.

5378
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:33,543
What did I say?

5379
02:25:34,290 --> 02:25:35,830
[inaudible]

5380
02:25:36,110 --> 02:25:36,911
do you know why?

5381
02:25:36,911 --> 02:25:38,740
Cause he's a comic named France Alameda.

5382
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:40,000
That's why.

5383
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:40,833
Hmm.

5384
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:42,243
So spell it.

5385
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:43,121
K a.

5386
02:25:43,121 --> 02:25:43,870
L A.

5387
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:43,871
V.

5388
02:25:43,871 --> 02:25:44,091
I t.

5389
02:25:44,091 --> 02:25:44,271
T.

5390
02:25:44,271 --> 02:25:45,760
A cal Alito.

5391
02:25:46,130 --> 02:25:46,963
Calla veto.

5392
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:49,613
Tell veto

5393
02:25:51,450 --> 02:25:52,290
the grip.

5394
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:54,340
Gj raves about this guy.

5395
02:25:54,430 --> 02:25:55,263
I know

5396
02:25:57,530 --> 02:25:59,920
his name because he didn't
want to get out on the podcast.

5397
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:00,870
He goes,

5398
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:02,140
I don't want anyone working with them.

5399
02:26:02,141 --> 02:26:03,100
And I can say his name like,

5400
02:26:03,101 --> 02:26:03,291
dude,

5401
02:26:03,291 --> 02:26:04,220
come on.

5402
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:05,163
He's hilarious.

5403
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:06,041
That's interesting.

5404
02:26:06,041 --> 02:26:07,270
But probably accurate.

5405
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:08,193
Yeah,

5406
02:26:08,830 --> 02:26:09,790
that's probably accurate.

5407
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:12,940
You find out about a scientist out there
that's just doing it for the art gives

5408
02:26:12,941 --> 02:26:14,170
you a huge advantage.

5409
02:26:14,470 --> 02:26:14,681
Yeah.

5410
02:26:14,681 --> 02:26:18,850
I mean this guy seems like he knows so
now lunch now or him and Tj have that.

5411
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:20,800
They went on that Jim Munios.

5412
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:21,191
It's him.

5413
02:26:21,191 --> 02:26:21,640
Right?

5414
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:23,350
And then they'll Scott in Pico there.

5415
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:25,840
That little fucking monster.

5416
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:27,063
Yeah,

5417
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:28,450
Aaron Picos terrifying.

5418
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:29,470
Oh my God.

5419
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:32,620
That left hook that he killed that dude
with the biggest prospect and it was

5420
02:26:32,621 --> 02:26:32,701
like,

5421
02:26:32,701 --> 02:26:33,010
oh,

5422
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:34,930
shovel hook like a left upper cut.

5423
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:37,030
His body shots nasty.

5424
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:41,020
But that one to the chin where just to
do just was out cold and just fell back

5425
02:26:41,021 --> 02:26:42,040
like Jesus.

5426
02:26:42,130 --> 02:26:43,420
It was like he takes shots,

5427
02:26:43,421 --> 02:26:46,600
he just doesn't respect his opponents
cause he fucks up worldclass guys all the

5428
02:26:46,601 --> 02:26:47,434
time in the gym.

5429
02:26:47,470 --> 02:26:48,400
So when they give them like,

5430
02:26:48,550 --> 02:26:48,701
oh,

5431
02:26:48,701 --> 02:26:49,490
here's layer,

5432
02:26:49,490 --> 02:26:50,061
he's foreign.

5433
02:26:50,061 --> 02:26:50,171
Oh.

5434
02:26:50,171 --> 02:26:50,530
He's like,

5435
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:51,670
fuck that Larry.

5436
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:53,590
And just walk forward.

5437
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,850
It's what they see in the gym.

5438
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,530
Eat some of the best guys in the world.

5439
02:26:56,531 --> 02:26:57,970
He started them.

5440
02:26:58,030 --> 02:26:58,811
Boom.

5441
02:26:58,811 --> 02:27:00,580
That is such a nasty hook,

5442
02:27:00,581 --> 02:27:01,414
man.

5443
02:27:01,430 --> 02:27:05,770
It's so perfectly placed
under the right arm.

5444
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:06,970
Look at that dude.

5445
02:27:06,971 --> 02:27:07,804
That is crazy.

5446
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:08,933
That was my time.

5447
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:10,300
That from the beginning,

5448
02:27:10,930 --> 02:27:11,681
the cows slick.

5449
02:27:11,681 --> 02:27:12,640
This is like this.

5450
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:14,620
He sees the righthand comment,

5451
02:27:14,621 --> 02:27:19,210
any hooks under it and right on the
Chin and there's slides and we're doing

5452
02:27:19,211 --> 02:27:21,700
right by him because they're not
throwing them to the wolves right away.

5453
02:27:21,790 --> 02:27:22,110
You're like,

5454
02:27:22,110 --> 02:27:22,781
if he's in the UFC,

5455
02:27:22,781 --> 02:27:25,630
he'd be fighting fucking
top 10 guys right away.

5456
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,960
Look at that nasty left hook to
the fucking liver right there.

5457
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:30,730
Two guys out to the body now.

5458
02:27:31,630 --> 02:27:32,081
Oh Man.

5459
02:27:32,081 --> 02:27:33,490
Liver shots are horrific.

5460
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:36,220
Nothing really might be
worse than him knocked out.

5461
02:27:36,310 --> 02:27:36,580
Yeah.

5462
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:37,870
There's literally nothing you can do.

5463
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:41,800
Kids at tank too and it's
super high level wrestler,

5464
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:43,030
wrestler and boxer.

5465
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:43,660
Yeah.

5466
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:44,110
Some list.

5467
02:27:44,110 --> 02:27:45,070
As long he's been wrestling,

5468
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:45,933
he can do it all.

5469
02:27:46,270 --> 02:27:47,980
Thinking about this Freddy Roach,

5470
02:27:47,981 --> 02:27:49,540
his corner to MMA fighters,

5471
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:51,820
him and GSP.

5472
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,750
So there must be something special
about that fucking kid dam.

5473
02:27:55,180 --> 02:27:56,220
And uh,

5474
02:27:56,230 --> 02:27:56,531
you know,

5475
02:27:56,531 --> 02:27:58,510
I'd like the story that
he lost his first fight.

5476
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:02,470
I liked that I was hyping up so
much on I working with flight,

5477
02:28:02,620 --> 02:28:03,360
but that's a,

5478
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:06,280
that's a a cold hard reminder.

5479
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:06,970
We'll ask.

5480
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:07,411
Got Coke.

5481
02:28:07,411 --> 02:28:07,721
Can I go?

5482
02:28:07,721 --> 02:28:10,240
Why would you give them that
big fucking duty goes Brennan.

5483
02:28:10,570 --> 02:28:11,860
We asked guys,

5484
02:28:11,861 --> 02:28:13,900
you would know vets and
they would not fight him.

5485
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:14,681
He was like,

5486
02:28:14,681 --> 02:28:17,950
there's like this mythical
fucking or about this kid.

5487
02:28:17,951 --> 02:28:18,820
No one wants to fund this.

5488
02:28:18,821 --> 02:28:20,290
The only guy we get fine.

5489
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:21,080
Wow.

5490
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:22,220
Was a terrible match for me.

5491
02:28:22,221 --> 02:28:23,660
It's fucking seven and eight.

5492
02:28:23,661 --> 02:28:25,280
Oh big or bigger guy.

5493
02:28:25,281 --> 02:28:27,110
Two weight classes up is a bad idea.

5494
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:31,590
Not so picos never fought before
and fight that mass square garden.

5495
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:32,480
His first fight,

5496
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:33,710
I didn't know the main car.

5497
02:28:33,711 --> 02:28:34,461
How much bigger than him.

5498
02:28:34,461 --> 02:28:36,470
I just thought the guy just
caught him with a shot.

5499
02:28:36,471 --> 02:28:37,304
He's a lot bigger.

5500
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:39,050
A lot bigger dude.

5501
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:40,420
Bad idea.

5502
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:40,790
What did,

5503
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:42,050
what did the guy weigh in at?

5504
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:44,540
I mean they weighed in the same,

5505
02:28:44,541 --> 02:28:44,970
but he's,

5506
02:28:44,970 --> 02:28:45,220
you know,

5507
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:45,530
he,

5508
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:47,480
his original weight classes higher up.

5509
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:48,170
Yeah,

5510
02:28:48,170 --> 02:28:49,130
he's a bigger fighter,

5511
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:51,360
but they just thought
anyone was so special.

5512
02:28:51,361 --> 02:28:52,340
He'd fucking starch him.

5513
02:28:52,530 --> 02:28:52,980
Well,

5514
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:53,431
it didn't.

5515
02:28:53,431 --> 02:28:55,670
The dude have a marginal record.

5516
02:28:55,671 --> 02:28:55,791
Look,

5517
02:28:55,791 --> 02:28:57,630
he'd only fought them to know once.

5518
02:28:57,640 --> 02:28:59,600
He really pretty sure
it's seven to no damn.

5519
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:00,290
Yeah,

5520
02:29:00,290 --> 02:29:01,790
he goes o and L.

5521
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,151
Oh,

5522
02:29:02,151 --> 02:29:02,901
I didn't know that.

5523
02:29:02,901 --> 02:29:03,710
Yeah,

5524
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:04,010
no.

5525
02:29:04,010 --> 02:29:04,161
Yeah.

5526
02:29:04,161 --> 02:29:04,491
I was like,

5527
02:29:04,491 --> 02:29:05,510
cause I asked coker,

5528
02:29:05,511 --> 02:29:06,111
you know who's great?

5529
02:29:06,111 --> 02:29:06,351
And I go,

5530
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:06,990
why the fuck would you,

5531
02:29:06,990 --> 02:29:09,710
I guess Brennan's only guy
who would take this fight.

5532
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:10,910
Wow.

5533
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:11,870
I guess he knew something.

5534
02:29:12,410 --> 02:29:12,621
Yeah.

5535
02:29:12,621 --> 02:29:13,160
I guess.

5536
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:14,090
What's homeboy's name?

5537
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:15,860
Who he lost to?

5538
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:16,251
Yeah,

5539
02:29:16,251 --> 02:29:17,084
I forget,

5540
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:18,110
but it's crazy.

5541
02:29:18,110 --> 02:29:18,530
What's that,

5542
02:29:18,530 --> 02:29:19,350
Zach?

5543
02:29:19,350 --> 02:29:19,941
That's right.

5544
02:29:19,941 --> 02:29:20,330
Exactly.

5545
02:29:20,330 --> 02:29:21,041
He's seven to know,

5546
02:29:21,041 --> 02:29:21,874
right?

5547
02:29:21,890 --> 02:29:22,581
It's probably eight.

5548
02:29:22,581 --> 02:29:22,860
No,

5549
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:23,693
no.

5550
02:29:25,090 --> 02:29:26,560
Unless he lost one since then.

5551
02:29:26,590 --> 02:29:27,520
That was a while ago.

5552
02:29:30,820 --> 02:29:31,010
No,

5553
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:32,150
he's nine and three now.

5554
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:32,331
Yeah,

5555
02:29:32,331 --> 02:29:33,164
he's lost.

5556
02:29:33,810 --> 02:29:34,643
Wow.

5557
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:37,900
Pull up the map the
thing so we could see it.

5558
02:29:37,901 --> 02:29:39,490
Two losses before he fought on Pico.

5559
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:40,510
So what was his record?

5560
02:29:40,511 --> 02:29:41,344
We fought Pico.

5561
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:41,471
Oh,

5562
02:29:41,471 --> 02:29:41,950
here we go.

5563
02:29:41,950 --> 02:29:43,000
I must have been eight and two.

5564
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:46,420
So a lot of evidence to the a wad.

5565
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:48,790
That guy's fucking good.

5566
02:29:48,791 --> 02:29:52,960
But still when he fought Piquillo
seven and two so nine fights.

5567
02:29:53,740 --> 02:29:55,320
That's a shitload for guys.

5568
02:29:55,321 --> 02:29:58,060
Zero to get sky was,

5569
02:29:58,300 --> 02:29:58,890
oh no,

5570
02:29:58,890 --> 02:29:59,770
it was my point.

5571
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:01,360
You fucking nuts man.

5572
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:02,291
And you know,

5573
02:30:02,291 --> 02:30:04,870
fighting in Madison
Square Garden first debut,

5574
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:06,640
you know you only get one debut.

5575
02:30:07,510 --> 02:30:08,710
It's a big deal.

5576
02:30:08,711 --> 02:30:10,690
And you're young pressure on TV.

5577
02:30:10,750 --> 02:30:14,020
Everyone knows how good you are and the
other guy's good and he got some Dick

5578
02:30:14,021 --> 02:30:16,190
head in a suit and tie in the box.

5579
02:30:16,191 --> 02:30:18,100
And you're the next
Lebron James or the MMA.

5580
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:19,570
His name's Brendan.

5581
02:30:19,630 --> 02:30:20,170
Yeah,

5582
02:30:20,170 --> 02:30:23,020
they just just fill your sim out.

5583
02:30:23,050 --> 02:30:24,530
Could they just take your button?

5584
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:24,760
Go.

5585
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:25,930
I still believe it though.

5586
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:26,823
Yeah,

5587
02:30:28,780 --> 02:30:29,561
like a balloon.

5588
02:30:29,561 --> 02:30:31,270
So you receive Franco Columbo,

5589
02:30:31,271 --> 02:30:33,610
make a hot water bottle
explode but below it into it.

5590
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:34,240
No,

5591
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,140
that's what people are doing.

5592
02:30:35,141 --> 02:30:35,321
It is.

5593
02:30:35,321 --> 02:30:37,700
But it's cool that low and smoke depot.

5594
02:30:38,150 --> 02:30:40,030
I was one of those guys
made to stand by it.

5595
02:30:40,060 --> 02:30:40,810
But he was right.

5596
02:30:40,810 --> 02:30:41,470
You were right.

5597
02:30:41,470 --> 02:30:41,921
He just,

5598
02:30:41,921 --> 02:30:45,640
it was a lesson and it's just part of
being a human being in competition and

5599
02:30:45,970 --> 02:30:49,240
look at Franco Columbo
checked just he would,

5600
02:30:49,330 --> 02:30:51,220
who would blow up a hot water bottle.

5601
02:30:51,221 --> 02:30:54,730
That's how strong his fucking
lunch until we would explode.

5602
02:30:55,090 --> 02:30:56,170
Holy Shit.

5603
02:30:56,171 --> 02:30:56,471
Look at me.

5604
02:30:56,471 --> 02:30:57,410
People are watching that bull.

5605
02:30:57,820 --> 02:30:58,421
This lady's like,

5606
02:30:58,421 --> 02:30:59,350
Oh my God,

5607
02:30:59,351 --> 02:31:00,250
I can't believe it.

5608
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:01,510
Do you not fucking strong.

5609
02:31:01,511 --> 02:31:03,010
Your lungs have to be to make this happen.

5610
02:31:03,011 --> 02:31:03,461
Like look at them.

5611
02:31:03,461 --> 02:31:05,620
He thing you know you have
nothing else going on.

5612
02:31:05,621 --> 02:31:06,850
Are you attending this live?

5613
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:09,130
That guy is a tank of a human.

5614
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:11,020
That's some old school,

5615
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:12,780
Italian neanderthal genes,

5616
02:31:12,781 --> 02:31:14,500
some old school entertainment.

5617
02:31:14,530 --> 02:31:14,800
God,

5618
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:16,030
look at those diamond pieces.

5619
02:31:16,060 --> 02:31:17,500
I bet that hot chick.

5620
02:31:21,430 --> 02:31:21,831
Come on.

5621
02:31:21,831 --> 02:31:22,620
Do it.

5622
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:25,020
That's the Arnold set dude.

5623
02:31:25,150 --> 02:31:25,983
Where Jack,

5624
02:31:26,210 --> 02:31:27,230
Why watch pumping iron?

5625
02:31:27,250 --> 02:31:29,730
I get sad that I wasn't back
then hanging out with them.

5626
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:32,460
They looked like they
were just doing steroids.

5627
02:31:32,610 --> 02:31:33,510
Fucking girls.

5628
02:31:33,511 --> 02:31:35,070
We'd Venice beach.

5629
02:31:35,071 --> 02:31:38,070
Jack wasn't all the bums are one.

5630
02:31:38,071 --> 02:31:39,120
They're just lifting every day.

5631
02:31:39,121 --> 02:31:41,040
It's fucking gold.

5632
02:31:41,250 --> 02:31:42,450
Just getting jacked.

5633
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:42,931
Yeah,

5634
02:31:42,931 --> 02:31:43,770
that's all he cared about.

5635
02:31:43,771 --> 02:31:48,771
Jackson pages and probably like at
a level that nobody had done before.

5636
02:31:48,871 --> 02:31:53,640
The steroids right along and all
of a sudden the party got started.

5637
02:31:54,150 --> 02:31:56,220
Like you look at it free when
they're hanging out with,

5638
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:57,510
you know what I got to tell you though?

5639
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:58,500
Here's what's weird.

5640
02:31:58,890 --> 02:32:00,450
If you look at Arnold right there,

5641
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:01,710
he was Mister Olympia.

5642
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:05,610
Obviously jacked as fuck but beautiful.

5643
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:09,300
Nowhere near as he Coleman is.

5644
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:13,170
Any of the big guys that you see today
we're talking about different steroids.

5645
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:13,471
Well,

5646
02:32:13,471 --> 02:32:13,910
it's nice.

5647
02:32:13,910 --> 02:32:18,910
See h came along and steroids and it's
not just that it's they just want to

5648
02:32:19,261 --> 02:32:20,790
continue to get bigger,

5649
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:25,620
like there should really be a time and
it's hard to figure out when that time is

5650
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:27,840
where you really don't
want to get any bigger.

5651
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:32,400
He just want to get more sculpted
and more ripped and more dif.

5652
02:32:32,430 --> 02:32:34,020
You want to get more proportionate.

5653
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:35,220
Well so that everything looks right,

5654
02:32:35,221 --> 02:32:38,350
whether it's your calves or
your like [inaudible] shit.

5655
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:40,670
That's why the same Ronnie
Coleman kind of fucked exam.

5656
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:41,340
Frank.

5657
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:41,581
Yeah.

5658
02:32:41,581 --> 02:32:44,730
They used to love Frank Zane even
though he was smaller than those guys.

5659
02:32:44,740 --> 02:32:45,360
Wheeler.

5660
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:45,820
Yeah.

5661
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:47,400
Unbelievable symmetry.

5662
02:32:47,460 --> 02:32:49,020
They said Ronnie Coleman
came along and was like,

5663
02:32:49,021 --> 02:32:49,171
oh,

5664
02:32:49,171 --> 02:32:53,700
cool story and just was like cash and
they said he's just fucked everything up

5665
02:32:53,701 --> 02:32:54,700
because he's so massive.

5666
02:32:54,810 --> 02:32:56,430
Even before him,

5667
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:57,450
Dorian Yates,

5668
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:00,220
Dorian Yates was a Dji aunt.

5669
02:33:00,430 --> 02:33:02,640
The mother fucker was hugely tall.

5670
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:03,960
No shorter.

5671
02:33:04,110 --> 02:33:04,291
See,

5672
02:33:04,291 --> 02:33:05,190
Ronnie was tall.

5673
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:05,461
Yeah,

5674
02:33:05,461 --> 02:33:05,940
that's true.

5675
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:07,260
Color for a bodybuilder.

5676
02:33:07,430 --> 02:33:08,880
I want to say he's taller than me.

5677
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:10,110
Dorian's taller than me,

5678
02:33:10,111 --> 02:33:11,660
but I don't pick the peas.

5679
02:33:11,730 --> 02:33:13,200
I don't think he's six feet tall,

5680
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:14,310
maybe six feet tall.

5681
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:15,413
But anyway,

5682
02:33:15,480 --> 02:33:16,350
in his prime,

5683
02:33:16,650 --> 02:33:18,570
he was safe.

5684
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:19,171
I mean,

5685
02:33:19,171 --> 02:33:20,850
mass talked to Ronnie Coleman,

5686
02:33:20,851 --> 02:33:21,330
massive.

5687
02:33:21,330 --> 02:33:22,950
He was pretty fucking big man.

5688
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:23,521
Ever.

5689
02:33:23,521 --> 02:33:24,900
See Dorian Yates is prime.

5690
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:26,610
She's picture at Gold's.

5691
02:33:26,611 --> 02:33:29,160
I don't know enough to say that.

5692
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:32,400
Who was the first guy to
gets super jacked like that?

5693
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:35,640
But he was the first Mr Olympia
that I remember seeing going,

5694
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:36,030
well,

5695
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:37,050
what the fuck?

5696
02:33:37,051 --> 02:33:37,831
Kind of steroids.

5697
02:33:37,831 --> 02:33:40,380
And they use it now and he talked about,

5698
02:33:40,381 --> 02:33:42,750
he's like super open
about it's full cycle.

5699
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:43,290
Oh really?

5700
02:33:43,290 --> 02:33:43,500
Took,

5701
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:44,311
Oh yeah man,

5702
02:33:44,311 --> 02:33:45,300
he did my pocket jacks.

5703
02:33:45,301 --> 02:33:46,081
He's the best.

5704
02:33:46,081 --> 02:33:48,840
Have you seen the Ronnie
Coleman doc on Netflix?

5705
02:33:48,841 --> 02:33:49,440
Haven't I heard?

5706
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:50,160
It's awesome.

5707
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:51,120
It's awesome.

5708
02:33:51,121 --> 02:33:53,070
It above me out in a boat out and go,

5709
02:33:53,071 --> 02:33:53,521
you know what?

5710
02:33:53,521 --> 02:33:56,700
I've never squat and a heavy ever
again or his back is destroyed.

5711
02:33:56,730 --> 02:33:56,850
Right?

5712
02:33:56,850 --> 02:34:00,450
Two hip replacements back's fucked and
he has to have crutches and he's like in

5713
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:01,790
constant pain now.

5714
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:05,040
Constant been taken
fucking opiates every day.

5715
02:34:05,070 --> 02:34:05,850
Didn't he have like,

5716
02:34:05,850 --> 02:34:06,240
bummer.

5717
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:07,860
Multiple back surgeries,

5718
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:09,030
multiple back surgeries,

5719
02:34:09,031 --> 02:34:10,530
fused pinched nerves.

5720
02:34:11,690 --> 02:34:11,991
Damn.

5721
02:34:11,991 --> 02:34:14,490
Look at Dory and now it's like me now.

5722
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,353
He looks at him there.

5723
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:16,193
Yeah.

5724
02:34:16,260 --> 02:34:16,531
Dude,

5725
02:34:16,531 --> 02:34:18,880
he was Jack's shaggy city.

5726
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:20,350
Ain't got Sham Ronnie though.

5727
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:21,790
See Him on stage though.

5728
02:34:21,791 --> 02:34:23,020
That's a picture.

5729
02:34:23,021 --> 02:34:24,100
He was bigger than that.

5730
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:25,720
Then we'll get to the far left.

5731
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:27,280
The far left up there.

5732
02:34:27,370 --> 02:34:30,040
Look at this size of that
mother Pharma's thickie.

5733
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:30,970
Dude,

5734
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:32,650
look at the size of him.

5735
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:38,340
He was fucking huge man and
shredded and just want to pick.

5736
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:42,600
He was worked harder than Alabamians.

5737
02:34:42,770 --> 02:34:43,180
Huge.

5738
02:34:43,180 --> 02:34:45,160
They were all on the steroids for sure.

5739
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:46,750
For sure.

5740
02:34:46,750 --> 02:34:47,740
Them steroids.

5741
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:49,630
They were all on all the steroids,

5742
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:54,840
but for sure that motherfucker worked
as hard if not harder than lifting

5743
02:34:55,901 --> 02:34:56,420
weights.

5744
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:57,550
Phil Heath was Jack to,

5745
02:34:57,610 --> 02:34:57,911
okay,

5746
02:34:57,911 --> 02:34:58,561
here's the question.

5747
02:34:58,561 --> 02:35:00,010
He's lost his last competition.

5748
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:00,641
We'll look at this.

5749
02:35:00,641 --> 02:35:01,390
Look at those two.

5750
02:35:01,390 --> 02:35:03,430
How do you decide which one is more jack?

5751
02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:04,480
That is insane to me.

5752
02:35:04,510 --> 02:35:05,590
That don't make any sense.

5753
02:35:05,860 --> 02:35:06,940
I look at those two and I go,

5754
02:35:06,941 --> 02:35:07,774
wow,

5755
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:08,860
and you have to have an eye for it,

5756
02:35:08,861 --> 02:35:09,840
right thing.

5757
02:35:09,841 --> 02:35:10,660
You're a jeweler.

5758
02:35:10,660 --> 02:35:12,640
You got to go over that
shit with jewelers glass.

5759
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:15,940
Look for cut color clarity and the tube.

5760
02:35:15,941 --> 02:35:16,890
Karen thrills.

5761
02:35:17,390 --> 02:35:17,690
Real.

5762
02:35:17,690 --> 02:35:18,780
Look at this to be an expert.

5763
02:35:18,850 --> 02:35:22,660
What the fuck to the greatest backs in
history is that is that is that they'll

5764
02:35:22,661 --> 02:35:23,494
take Ronnie,

5765
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:26,530
Ronnie Coleman on the top
left or was that Phil?

5766
02:35:27,210 --> 02:35:29,140
That's during Ronney Colon.

5767
02:35:29,230 --> 02:35:31,900
Ronnie Coleman's ass is out of control.

5768
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:34,810
W but do you saying it's a Phil Heath?

5769
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:37,090
I think that's running
Coleman tried to call.

5770
02:35:37,091 --> 02:35:38,170
I know Ronnie's ass.

5771
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:38,891
Oh Wow.

5772
02:35:38,891 --> 02:35:39,251
Strong.

5773
02:35:39,251 --> 02:35:40,180
I know Ronnie ass.

5774
02:35:40,210 --> 02:35:43,090
That's a Ronnie fuck his lats look at,

5775
02:35:43,091 --> 02:35:48,091
they look like they're on a supermarket
shelf covered in Saran wrap it right.

5776
02:35:48,251 --> 02:35:52,510
It doesn't look like he has any fat to
it looks they look like ribs baby back

5777
02:35:52,511 --> 02:35:54,010
ribs that you put barbecue on.

5778
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:55,750
It looks like he could
look at Dorian Yates.

5779
02:35:55,870 --> 02:36:00,190
It looks like he could pull your
head right through your back.

5780
02:36:00,191 --> 02:36:04,720
Like tap your head with your spinal
column attached and just pull it out like

5781
02:36:04,721 --> 02:36:05,860
the Moose Lake gts.

5782
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:06,071
Yeah,

5783
02:36:06,071 --> 02:36:07,730
just leave a hole we accord.

5784
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:08,710
Used to be for sure.

5785
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:10,413
Here's the thing though,

5786
02:36:10,450 --> 02:36:14,320
during the eighth got that flat
ass compared to Ronnie flatty.

5787
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:17,890
Why are you flat a white
room and I don't see that.

5788
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:18,970
I saw in that picture,

5789
02:36:20,060 --> 02:36:22,370
that picture side by side picture plays.

5790
02:36:22,570 --> 02:36:24,340
It was a part of a different one.

5791
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:25,720
It was a part of an article.

5792
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:27,690
It was like one of these small towns.

5793
02:36:27,850 --> 02:36:28,690
That's Phil.

5794
02:36:29,770 --> 02:36:31,900
Can you back sheets?

5795
02:36:32,770 --> 02:36:33,281
I tried that.

5796
02:36:33,281 --> 02:36:33,730
It didn't work.

5797
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:34,270
Did it work?

5798
02:36:34,270 --> 02:36:35,420
Can't you type in uh,

5799
02:36:35,440 --> 02:36:36,340
during the eighth verse,

5800
02:36:36,341 --> 02:36:39,960
Ronnie Coleman and Big
Birdie or no glutes,

5801
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:40,840
glutes,

5802
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:41,890
the proper term door.

5803
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:46,450
How about just type in Dorian
Yates big booty or na right there.

5804
02:36:46,451 --> 02:36:47,260
There it is.

5805
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:47,831
Come on Bro.

5806
02:36:47,831 --> 02:36:48,041
Okay,

5807
02:36:48,041 --> 02:36:49,450
but he's sucking in that in man.

5808
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:54,510
Something was Poland is his back at some
of the g string and get his butt and

5809
02:36:54,551 --> 02:36:58,030
then Ronnie Coleman's pulling the
Jewish history hungry but is eating.

5810
02:36:58,031 --> 02:36:59,890
Those are the ones that ass at,

5811
02:36:59,891 --> 02:37:00,341
first of all,

5812
02:37:00,341 --> 02:37:01,900
there's no reason to
wear those shorts boys.

5813
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:02,850
We get it.

5814
02:37:02,850 --> 02:37:03,431
We got it.

5815
02:37:03,431 --> 02:37:05,260
We know that you have a
senior to for asshole,

5816
02:37:05,530 --> 02:37:06,820
but at a certain point in time,

5817
02:37:06,821 --> 02:37:08,610
like your shorts are
too little to minutes.

5818
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:09,680
Flat ass little,

5819
02:37:09,681 --> 02:37:10,780
but he's a little,

5820
02:37:10,781 --> 02:37:12,670
but he's on a little bike,

5821
02:37:12,671 --> 02:37:13,030
right?

5822
02:37:13,030 --> 02:37:13,271
Yeah,

5823
02:37:13,271 --> 02:37:13,411
no,

5824
02:37:13,411 --> 02:37:14,620
we get Ronnie's bucket.

5825
02:37:14,650 --> 02:37:15,201
Is that Ronnie?

5826
02:37:15,201 --> 02:37:16,034
On the right.

5827
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,300
Does Ronnie,

5828
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:20,120
so blacks and all those
loan leave at peach.

5829
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,983
I take it back.

5830
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:22,490
I take back what I said.

5831
02:37:22,491 --> 02:37:23,420
I can tell the difference,

5832
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:25,640
but I can't though because well go.

5833
02:37:25,641 --> 02:37:28,130
I can't make go go larger
gang go larger again,

5834
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:29,601
Ronnie.

5835
02:37:29,601 --> 02:37:30,434
All Day.

5836
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:33,410
Ronnie's look at his lower back.

5837
02:37:33,411 --> 02:37:34,430
What is going on in there?

5838
02:37:34,580 --> 02:37:35,413
That's the same.

5839
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:36,433
Yeah.

5840
02:37:36,470 --> 02:37:39,170
I guess they're both fucking insane.

5841
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:42,020
The difference really to
me is from the waist down,

5842
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:43,110
but agree.

5843
02:37:43,110 --> 02:37:44,450
But what?

5844
02:37:44,451 --> 02:37:45,860
Ronnie's legs are spread out.

5845
02:37:45,890 --> 02:37:46,500
Ooh.

5846
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:46,821
See,

5847
02:37:46,821 --> 02:37:47,300
okay.

5848
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:48,200
Now it's different,

5849
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:51,080
but still Ronnie's legs or they're crazy,

5850
02:37:51,350 --> 02:37:51,581
dude.

5851
02:37:51,581 --> 02:37:52,414
We're talking about Ronnie's.

5852
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:52,921
Look at it.

5853
02:37:52,921 --> 02:37:54,860
It's been who did his buttocks?

5854
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:57,160
He's got extra inches of buttocks.

5855
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:57,560
Ooh.

5856
02:37:57,560 --> 02:37:57,890
Uh,

5857
02:37:57,890 --> 02:37:58,461
Korean Zombie.

5858
02:37:58,461 --> 02:38:00,170
Just fucking look like those ACL.

5859
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:00,850
Oh,

5860
02:38:00,850 --> 02:38:01,683
just started.

5861
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:02,653
Oh Shit.

5862
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:03,620
We're looking at male,

5863
02:38:03,660 --> 02:38:06,530
but he did have a flat ass though.

5864
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:07,940
Ronnie Coleman's gonna ignore him.

5865
02:38:07,941 --> 02:38:09,560
His ass do know Jamie,

5866
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:10,603
keep that at one.

5867
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:11,990
Make it bigger.

5868
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,141
No,

5869
02:38:12,141 --> 02:38:12,830
keep that up.

5870
02:38:12,830 --> 02:38:14,580
That last picture version.

5871
02:38:14,980 --> 02:38:15,200
Yeah,

5872
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:15,770
find a bed.

5873
02:38:15,770 --> 02:38:16,860
Get them bending over Kenya.

5874
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:17,031
Oh,

5875
02:38:17,031 --> 02:38:17,750
there you go.

5876
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:19,060
That's plenty delicately.

5877
02:38:19,061 --> 02:38:19,671
It's ass,

5878
02:38:19,671 --> 02:38:20,170
dude.

5879
02:38:20,170 --> 02:38:20,850
That's how it's,

5880
02:38:20,850 --> 02:38:21,683
it's outrageous.

5881
02:38:21,710 --> 02:38:22,820
That's outrageous.

5882
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:24,100
Let me see that last picture.

5883
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:24,953
Jamie.

5884
02:38:25,460 --> 02:38:30,460
Oh Jesus Christ during the eighth got
that flat f this size of Ronnie Coleman's

5885
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:31,450
muscles.

5886
02:38:31,450 --> 02:38:31,991
I do.

5887
02:38:31,991 --> 02:38:32,824
It's breezy.

5888
02:38:32,870 --> 02:38:36,440
Muscles look like he could fucking
kick through a building real thick.

5889
02:38:36,441 --> 02:38:37,910
His back is okay.

5890
02:38:37,911 --> 02:38:38,744
Here's the question.

5891
02:38:38,930 --> 02:38:39,231
Now.

5892
02:38:39,231 --> 02:38:40,310
His back's destroyed,

5893
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:41,330
his hips destroyed,

5894
02:38:41,331 --> 02:38:42,290
his knees are destroyed.

5895
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:45,830
Do you think that they
did things differently?

5896
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:47,450
Do you think he said Ronnie did.

5897
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:51,770
If when you ask the doctor like they have
everyone who compete against even Jay

5898
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:51,771
Cutler,

5899
02:38:51,771 --> 02:38:52,490
they go,

5900
02:38:52,490 --> 02:38:52,761
dude,

5901
02:38:52,761 --> 02:38:53,150
we,

5902
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:56,510
we were trained with Ronnie sometimes
and no one wanted to train with him cause

5903
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:59,420
he would just do things
we wouldn't do like what?

5904
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:02,000
Like 800 pounds squat
all the fucking time.

5905
02:39:02,830 --> 02:39:03,663
Listen,

5906
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:05,000
Jesus,

5907
02:39:05,230 --> 02:39:05,670
every,

5908
02:39:05,670 --> 02:39:07,610
all the Bodybio say he's
the biggest freak ever.

5909
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:09,140
How strong he was too.

5910
02:39:09,141 --> 02:39:09,974
They said he just,

5911
02:39:10,220 --> 02:39:12,980
the amount of work you do inside
that weight room was insane.

5912
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:14,810
The crazy thing was when he was a cop,

5913
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:15,351
oh yeah,

5914
02:39:15,351 --> 02:39:18,440
I am a genius with a beautiful leg kicks
inside and then now he's managing him,

5915
02:39:18,441 --> 02:39:19,520
pulled over by him for weed.

5916
02:39:19,521 --> 02:39:19,731
I'm like,

5917
02:39:19,731 --> 02:39:19,960
Bro,

5918
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:23,690
line fucking more legal drugs in their
system than me with the foot to talking

5919
02:39:23,691 --> 02:39:25,090
about what are we talking about?

5920
02:39:25,100 --> 02:39:25,581
Come on dude,

5921
02:39:25,581 --> 02:39:26,061
let me go.

5922
02:39:26,061 --> 02:39:26,330
Right.

5923
02:39:26,330 --> 02:39:27,560
I'll be ironic.

5924
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:28,850
It'd be hilarious.

5925
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:33,950
That would be super ironic because that
guy's on illegal drugs like literally.

5926
02:39:33,980 --> 02:39:35,360
You can't get that big without them.

5927
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:37,100
It's not possible.

5928
02:39:37,910 --> 02:39:38,151
Dude,

5929
02:39:38,151 --> 02:39:39,710
Jay Cutler and these interviews,

5930
02:39:39,711 --> 02:39:40,161
he just,

5931
02:39:40,161 --> 02:39:43,520
I don't know if I want to
hate on the guy did don't.

5932
02:39:43,850 --> 02:39:44,001
Yeah,

5933
02:39:44,001 --> 02:39:44,834
I'm not going to,

5934
02:39:44,990 --> 02:39:46,640
it's hard not to write God.

5935
02:39:46,700 --> 02:39:47,750
Get a couple beers in yet.

5936
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:50,830
Haterade came down.

5937
02:39:50,940 --> 02:39:52,310
He's don't want to talk shit.

5938
02:39:52,820 --> 02:39:53,151
Damn.

5939
02:39:53,151 --> 02:39:55,130
J Co was giant to Jay Cutler.

5940
02:39:55,131 --> 02:39:57,530
Beat him when he's going
for a number nine right.

5941
02:39:57,630 --> 02:39:57,801
Well,

5942
02:39:57,801 --> 02:40:00,920
I never would thought Ronnie Coleman
shouldn't a done nine just stopped at

5943
02:40:00,921 --> 02:40:01,640
eight.

5944
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:02,473
Oh,

5945
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:03,500
fucking Phil Heath,

5946
02:40:03,501 --> 02:40:05,150
my boy Phil Heath lost the last one.

5947
02:40:05,330 --> 02:40:06,320
Who won the last one?

5948
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:07,330
I was say Mr Olympia.

5949
02:40:07,360 --> 02:40:08,193
Never heard of him.

5950
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:11,120
A guy who they compare to flex wheeler,

5951
02:40:11,121 --> 02:40:11,301
right.

5952
02:40:11,301 --> 02:40:12,920
He's a smallest thinner dude.

5953
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:13,980
When I say thin,

5954
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:17,820
I can't tell how many of these
are photo shopped or oh my God.

5955
02:40:18,090 --> 02:40:18,601
Wait a minute.

5956
02:40:18,601 --> 02:40:19,470
Is that real?

5957
02:40:19,650 --> 02:40:21,750
Go back to that last
picture he just picked up.

5958
02:40:22,170 --> 02:40:23,220
Jesus Christ.

5959
02:40:23,221 --> 02:40:24,054
Make that bigger.

5960
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:26,820
What the fuck dude?

5961
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:30,270
To get us people that are definitely
Photoshop but like that one doesn't look

5962
02:40:30,271 --> 02:40:31,200
like it's real.

5963
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:32,910
That guy looks like a video game.

5964
02:40:32,970 --> 02:40:33,803
Character.

5965
02:40:33,950 --> 02:40:34,420
Photoshop.

5966
02:40:34,420 --> 02:40:34,531
Yeah,

5967
02:40:34,531 --> 02:40:37,710
that looks Photoshop and zombies down on
a piece in up here while we're talking

5968
02:40:37,711 --> 02:40:38,340
about ass.

5969
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:39,000
Oh Man.

5970
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:39,391
So yeah,

5971
02:40:39,391 --> 02:40:41,310
here was teeing off on
him just a moment ago.

5972
02:40:41,311 --> 02:40:41,940
Is He?

5973
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:42,660
Yeah.

5974
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:42,871
Dude.

5975
02:40:42,871 --> 02:40:43,170
Who won?

5976
02:40:43,170 --> 02:40:43,470
Who won?

5977
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:44,760
2018 Olympia.

5978
02:40:44,790 --> 02:40:45,300
This guy.

5979
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:45,601
Oh Wow.

5980
02:40:45,601 --> 02:40:46,370
He's not sure it was.

5981
02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:48,240
You're not flex wheeler at all.

5982
02:40:48,750 --> 02:40:49,890
Giant ass thighs,

5983
02:40:49,891 --> 02:40:52,800
but it looks fine sized there dude.

5984
02:40:52,801 --> 02:40:54,910
His apps or blah.

5985
02:40:55,210 --> 02:40:56,043
It's a weird,

5986
02:40:56,250 --> 02:40:56,461
yeah,

5987
02:40:56,461 --> 02:40:57,330
they look like inside.

5988
02:40:57,360 --> 02:40:57,751
How come?

5989
02:40:57,751 --> 02:40:58,171
That's okay.

5990
02:40:58,171 --> 02:40:59,130
But blackface isn't,

5991
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:01,710
well I think as black Joe.

5992
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:02,830
Okay,

5993
02:41:02,830 --> 02:41:03,420
what?

5994
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:05,370
He's black but everybody does that.

5995
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:06,780
Or you can do that too.

5996
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:08,160
I know they all do that.

5997
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:08,670
You know?

5998
02:41:08,670 --> 02:41:09,600
Oh my God,

5999
02:41:09,630 --> 02:41:09,991
look at that.

6000
02:41:09,991 --> 02:41:10,410
Wait a minute.

6001
02:41:10,410 --> 02:41:11,160
Is he black?

6002
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:11,761
If he's black,

6003
02:41:11,761 --> 02:41:15,330
why did he look so wider in that
photo when he was doing most muscular?

6004
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,493
I don't know.

6005
02:41:17,020 --> 02:41:17,240
Jay,

6006
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:20,760
who was those as close on that gentleman
through upper left hand corner.

6007
02:41:20,970 --> 02:41:22,650
Upper left hand corner
like you had before.

6008
02:41:23,310 --> 02:41:25,380
The image in the upper left
hand corner keeps rolling up.

6009
02:41:26,460 --> 02:41:26,880
Okay.

6010
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:27,990
All the way up that one.

6011
02:41:27,991 --> 02:41:28,290
Okay.

6012
02:41:28,290 --> 02:41:29,123
Yeah.

6013
02:41:29,740 --> 02:41:30,400
Okay.

6014
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:32,050
He might be African American,

6015
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:33,190
but he kind of,

6016
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:33,441
Tina,

6017
02:41:33,441 --> 02:41:34,520
we should probably pay attention.

6018
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:35,631
What do you think he is?

6019
02:41:35,631 --> 02:41:36,710
Jamie was his nationality.

6020
02:41:37,130 --> 02:41:38,090
I'm not talking about that guy.

6021
02:41:38,150 --> 02:41:38,983
That's the same guy.

6022
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:40,100
The guy with the black abs.

6023
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:40,491
No,

6024
02:41:40,491 --> 02:41:41,001
that's not him.

6025
02:41:41,001 --> 02:41:41,330
Is it?

6026
02:41:41,330 --> 02:41:42,080
Yes.

6027
02:41:42,080 --> 02:41:42,321
Oh,

6028
02:41:42,321 --> 02:41:42,710
he's,

6029
02:41:42,710 --> 02:41:43,411
that's what I'm saying.

6030
02:41:43,411 --> 02:41:44,210
I'm black.

6031
02:41:44,210 --> 02:41:45,020
Right?

6032
02:41:45,020 --> 02:41:45,770
Or if he has,

6033
02:41:45,770 --> 02:41:46,251
he's very light.

6034
02:41:46,251 --> 02:41:50,000
But what I'm saying is they are allowed
to wear that stuff that makes your skin

6035
02:41:50,001 --> 02:41:50,834
look dark.

6036
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:51,651
So as you can see,

6037
02:41:51,651 --> 02:41:52,330
the muscles better.

6038
02:41:52,330 --> 02:41:52,640
Right?

6039
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:54,590
But they get to a point
where it's literally,

6040
02:41:54,591 --> 02:41:55,330
it's blackface.

6041
02:41:55,330 --> 02:41:56,240
It's black body.

6042
02:41:56,990 --> 02:41:59,060
I also faced this from Egypt.

6043
02:41:59,180 --> 02:41:59,491
Okay,

6044
02:41:59,491 --> 02:42:00,324
so he's,

6045
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:03,170
but he's much lighter,

6046
02:42:03,400 --> 02:42:04,730
more images,

6047
02:42:04,731 --> 02:42:06,620
more Maha Maha.

6048
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:11,060
It doesn't make sense if that
one of them has an accurate,

6049
02:42:11,061 --> 02:42:12,230
the one that most Moscow with it,

6050
02:42:12,231 --> 02:42:12,830
you just put up,

6051
02:42:12,830 --> 02:42:14,510
if that's an accurate skin tone car.

6052
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:15,231
Jesus Christ.

6053
02:42:15,231 --> 02:42:17,070
Jesus fucking Christ.

6054
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:17,541
God,

6055
02:42:17,541 --> 02:42:18,374
he's huge.

6056
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:19,850
God Dog.

6057
02:42:19,851 --> 02:42:20,211
What?

6058
02:42:20,211 --> 02:42:23,180
That one picture where you see his whole
body that isn't even look like a real

6059
02:42:23,181 --> 02:42:23,840
person.

6060
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:25,100
Here's an ass on them too.

6061
02:42:25,101 --> 02:42:26,450
That Egyptian ass bro.

6062
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:27,180
Dude,

6063
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:27,890
that dude.

6064
02:42:27,890 --> 02:42:29,690
How mad are people that
we're talking about ass?

6065
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:30,893
That's fine.

6066
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:31,911
Oh,

6067
02:42:31,911 --> 02:42:33,170
Korean Zombie with a straight left.

6068
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:34,401
He won the thing.

6069
02:42:34,401 --> 02:42:35,890
This dude from Egypt believe so.

6070
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:36,330
Yeah.

6071
02:42:36,330 --> 02:42:37,163
Be beat Phil here.

6072
02:42:37,570 --> 02:42:38,403
That's right.

6073
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:39,200
Wow.

6074
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:40,370
He's a beast man.

6075
02:42:40,400 --> 02:42:40,851
And you know,

6076
02:42:40,851 --> 02:42:41,960
fucking this,

6077
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:43,580
this beautiful spiritual position.

6078
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:45,720
I'll look a double tap on the face,

6079
02:42:45,721 --> 02:42:46,554
but Green Zone,

6080
02:42:46,580 --> 02:42:49,490
high green just stopped doing
the Olympia because it was uh,

6081
02:42:49,710 --> 02:42:50,391
like rigged.

6082
02:42:50,391 --> 02:42:50,781
So he's like,

6083
02:42:50,781 --> 02:42:51,614
fuck this dude.

6084
02:42:52,130 --> 02:42:52,963
Yeah.

6085
02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:53,811
He'd be a good guy.

6086
02:42:53,811 --> 02:42:54,440
Get on the park.

6087
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:56,540
Why they think it's rigged?

6088
02:42:57,140 --> 02:42:58,260
A category and always Kia.

6089
02:42:58,410 --> 02:42:59,620
Jesus Christ.

6090
02:42:59,630 --> 02:43:00,770
God Damn.

6091
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:03,820
What big Ramey as EDC is his name?

6092
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:04,370
Ramey.

6093
02:43:04,370 --> 02:43:04,850
I think so.

6094
02:43:04,850 --> 02:43:04,980
Yeah.

6095
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:05,990
What is his full name?

6096
02:43:06,020 --> 02:43:06,910
We should be what?

6097
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:08,300
I tried pronouncing credits.

6098
02:43:08,310 --> 02:43:09,080
Jostle.

6099
02:43:09,080 --> 02:43:09,913
Let me go back to it.

6100
02:43:10,130 --> 02:43:11,860
Let me try to pretty much
better at names than me.

6101
02:43:13,540 --> 02:43:14,710
I don't want to fuck this up.

6102
02:43:14,890 --> 02:43:16,680
Momma do else?

6103
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:17,680
Ba?

6104
02:43:17,740 --> 02:43:17,901
No,

6105
02:43:17,901 --> 02:43:18,460
mom,

6106
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:19,810
let's listen to someone say it.

6107
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:21,453
It's fine.

6108
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:24,770
I don't want to fuck out man.

6109
02:43:24,771 --> 02:43:29,410
Sounds so authentic that I feel like five
ten three hundred ten pounds contest.

6110
02:43:29,411 --> 02:43:30,100
Wait,

6111
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:32,710
five 10 yeah,

6112
02:43:32,711 --> 02:43:33,200
it's me,

6113
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:34,240
Fairmont son.

6114
02:43:34,670 --> 02:43:35,130
That's it.

6115
02:43:35,130 --> 02:43:35,963
Thick dude.

6116
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:38,170
Especially the type of girl.

6117
02:43:38,590 --> 02:43:39,430
White guys,

6118
02:43:39,580 --> 02:43:41,180
like regular white guys.

6119
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:42,790
Who was the white guy?

6120
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:43,371
The big guy.

6121
02:43:43,371 --> 02:43:44,890
The Gunther Maryam.

6122
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:46,600
He would compete with Ronnie Coleman.

6123
02:43:46,601 --> 02:43:47,434
Those guys?

6124
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:48,250
No,

6125
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:49,090
he's name is Gunther.

6126
02:43:49,091 --> 02:43:53,300
He was a giant Swede and you're
just like fucking colossal from X.

6127
02:43:53,300 --> 02:43:55,090
Men would go chocolate face.

6128
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:56,890
Do they get chocolate but you can't.

6129
02:43:56,891 --> 02:44:01,570
Jay Cutler went chocolate j girls show
10 girls do it too and we just accept it.

6130
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:01,940
Yeah,

6131
02:44:01,940 --> 02:44:03,130
it's full chocolate body.

6132
02:44:03,170 --> 02:44:05,080
It's full chocolate
body and chocolate face.

6133
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:05,340
Yeah.

6134
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:07,240
It's like as long as
you go full chocolate,

6135
02:44:07,270 --> 02:44:09,040
as long as you have tracks
and they don't give a fuck,

6136
02:44:09,070 --> 02:44:09,851
but you have to go everywhere.

6137
02:44:09,851 --> 02:44:13,570
You can't have like one side chocolate
and one side not have face trying to win

6138
02:44:13,571 --> 02:44:14,200
or not.

6139
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:14,530
Well,

6140
02:44:14,530 --> 02:44:15,221
not only that,

6141
02:44:15,221 --> 02:44:15,971
like it's not legal.

6142
02:44:15,971 --> 02:44:17,220
You have to pretend you're one collar.

6143
02:44:17,250 --> 02:44:17,410
Yeah,

6144
02:44:17,410 --> 02:44:18,150
you do.

6145
02:44:18,150 --> 02:44:20,620
Except the fact that you're in
chocolate body and chocolate face.

6146
02:44:20,621 --> 02:44:21,431
What is that?

6147
02:44:21,431 --> 02:44:22,264
That's not real.

6148
02:44:22,270 --> 02:44:22,790
Is that real?

6149
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:23,880
Just as bill.

6150
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:26,200
He will not believe my face bell mistakes.

6151
02:44:26,201 --> 02:44:27,400
I think that might be real.

6152
02:44:27,490 --> 02:44:27,881
He went,

6153
02:44:27,881 --> 02:44:28,511
leave my face,

6154
02:44:28,511 --> 02:44:29,310
bro.

6155
02:44:29,310 --> 02:44:29,470
Dude,

6156
02:44:29,470 --> 02:44:30,150
he's body.

6157
02:44:30,150 --> 02:44:31,240
He went chocolate body.

6158
02:44:31,630 --> 02:44:32,191
That not ray.

6159
02:44:32,191 --> 02:44:32,570
He was.

6160
02:44:32,570 --> 02:44:35,300
He was a really progressive bodybuilder
and he couldn't go blackface.

6161
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:37,570
He went though and then
go back to that picture.

6162
02:44:37,750 --> 02:44:39,010
He went chocolate body,

6163
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:42,010
but his face didn't touch it.

6164
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:43,600
You can't give him that much.

6165
02:44:43,601 --> 02:44:44,370
Did a little okay.

6166
02:44:44,370 --> 02:44:46,990
Give him like he pretended
he rolled around in the dirt.

6167
02:44:48,430 --> 02:44:49,540
Can't give him a metal bro.

6168
02:44:50,140 --> 02:44:50,351
Yeah,

6169
02:44:50,351 --> 02:44:50,501
man.

6170
02:44:50,501 --> 02:44:52,720
He's going to win because
he went only chocolate body,

6171
02:44:52,721 --> 02:44:54,340
which is totally socially acceptable.

6172
02:44:54,610 --> 02:44:58,420
He totally didn't go chocolate
face to chocolate body.

6173
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:02,590
They're literally spray tanning this
people exactly what they're deer and

6174
02:45:02,591 --> 02:45:04,240
turning that guy black.

6175
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:04,750
Go back.

6176
02:45:04,750 --> 02:45:06,640
Oh my God.

6177
02:45:06,670 --> 02:45:07,900
But he keeps the face.

6178
02:45:08,530 --> 02:45:09,363
Is this real?

6179
02:45:10,030 --> 02:45:12,720
That's before he went out as cannot
be released before he went out.

6180
02:45:12,730 --> 02:45:13,241
This is like,

6181
02:45:13,241 --> 02:45:13,631
he's like,

6182
02:45:13,631 --> 02:45:16,940
you mother fuckers are not taking a
picture of me with black face on within

6183
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:17,710
probably like Michelle,

6184
02:45:17,710 --> 02:45:18,311
how ridiculous.

6185
02:45:18,311 --> 02:45:19,510
Let's just call it chocolate face.

6186
02:45:19,540 --> 02:45:19,990
Let's all call,

6187
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:21,340
but that's just going on

6188
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,453
pure chocolate.

6189
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:26,951
I mean,

6190
02:45:26,951 --> 02:45:30,070
I know he doesn't want to be racist and
I'm not saying that there's no intent

6191
02:45:30,071 --> 02:45:31,150
there to be raising chin.

6192
02:45:31,270 --> 02:45:32,103
Imagine.

6193
02:45:32,110 --> 02:45:34,000
Imagine if from this conversation,

6194
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:35,710
what the fuck is that guy doing?

6195
02:45:35,740 --> 02:45:37,000
That's Brian [inaudible].

6196
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:37,390
Brian,

6197
02:45:37,390 --> 02:45:41,170
he's gets his body bronze up to up to
the neck and then he leaves it alone.

6198
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:43,390
What does hats right before I went at him.

6199
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:44,500
Wow.

6200
02:45:44,500 --> 02:45:45,070
Okay.

6201
02:45:45,070 --> 02:45:45,790
Imagine.

6202
02:45:45,790 --> 02:45:49,750
Just imagine if because of
this conversation we put blue,

6203
02:45:49,770 --> 02:45:52,210
we bring awareness to chocolate face,

6204
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:56,680
which is essentially a socially
acceptable version of blackface.

6205
02:45:57,280 --> 02:45:58,710
We're basically to look at this guy,

6206
02:46:00,070 --> 02:46:01,390
you need to go to jail,

6207
02:46:01,391 --> 02:46:02,224
sir.

6208
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:07,793
Please

6209
02:46:08,900 --> 02:46:10,060
don't tell

6210
02:46:10,090 --> 02:46:10,750
me sir.

6211
02:46:10,750 --> 02:46:12,530
We give a guy no listen,

6212
02:46:12,710 --> 02:46:14,300
but even forget all that.

6213
02:46:14,330 --> 02:46:16,580
You don't look better when you do that.

6214
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:19,360
You just look insane like you.

6215
02:46:19,361 --> 02:46:22,700
You have a black man's skin
color and you have blonde,

6216
02:46:22,701 --> 02:46:23,810
spiky hair.

6217
02:46:24,170 --> 02:46:25,420
This is insanity.

6218
02:46:25,430 --> 02:46:26,270
What am I looking at?

6219
02:46:26,271 --> 02:46:27,980
How hard he worked this way,

6220
02:46:27,981 --> 02:46:28,251
dude,

6221
02:46:28,251 --> 02:46:29,270
I'm looking at a puzzle.

6222
02:46:30,280 --> 02:46:30,580
I'm like,

6223
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:32,000
what is that a hot math?

6224
02:46:32,001 --> 02:46:32,241
I'm like,

6225
02:46:32,241 --> 02:46:33,080
what is that puzzle?

6226
02:46:33,110 --> 02:46:35,630
Oh fuck here with a nice head kick.

6227
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:37,100
Maybe we should pay attention to this.

6228
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:38,690
Awesome fight through that white guy.

6229
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:39,543
Like schooling,

6230
02:46:39,570 --> 02:46:41,240
different of chocolate body.

6231
02:46:41,300 --> 02:46:42,100
Same Guy.

6232
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:42,431
No,

6233
02:46:42,431 --> 02:46:42,551
no,

6234
02:46:42,551 --> 02:46:42,680
no,

6235
02:46:42,680 --> 02:46:43,440
but that's,

6236
02:46:43,440 --> 02:46:45,000
that's one guy dolled up and the other,

6237
02:46:45,010 --> 02:46:46,040
just an actual say,

6238
02:46:46,050 --> 02:46:46,760
listen man,

6239
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:47,593
I get it.

6240
02:46:47,630 --> 02:46:48,800
Black guys look better.

6241
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:51,110
You just going to have to deal
with you see the muscle fiber.

6242
02:46:51,111 --> 02:46:54,960
I agreed to just be white chocolate body

6243
02:46:59,950 --> 02:47:00,783
body.

6244
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:04,530
I'll read the first one.

6245
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:05,960
Staffer say this.

6246
02:47:06,290 --> 02:47:07,011
No,

6247
02:47:07,011 --> 02:47:07,844
I'm sure.

6248
02:47:09,230 --> 02:47:11,920
I think we might be the first to call it
chocolate body and I think that shit is

6249
02:47:11,930 --> 02:47:12,560
going to stick.

6250
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,393
Oh,

6251
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:15,310
baffled spending Yeovil by yeah.

6252
02:47:15,360 --> 02:47:16,710
You look at it.

6253
02:47:16,760 --> 02:47:16,941
Yeah.

6254
02:47:16,941 --> 02:47:18,020
You're looking for the sweet.

6255
02:47:18,110 --> 02:47:19,690
But think about fighters Tan.

6256
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:22,190
Try to get real tan.

6257
02:47:22,340 --> 02:47:22,521
Yeah.

6258
02:47:22,521 --> 02:47:24,200
Here keeps the chocolate hip toss.

6259
02:47:25,850 --> 02:47:26,151
Yeah,

6260
02:47:26,151 --> 02:47:26,691
they do.

6261
02:47:26,691 --> 02:47:27,650
Fighters get tanned,

6262
02:47:27,651 --> 02:47:28,970
but George Saint Pierre did.

6263
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:29,871
But you know there's a,

6264
02:47:29,871 --> 02:47:31,370
there's actually what you got yellow.

6265
02:47:31,460 --> 02:47:32,151
It was actually,

6266
02:47:32,151 --> 02:47:32,511
there's a,

6267
02:47:32,511 --> 02:47:35,810
there's an actual benefit like
in terms of your performance,

6268
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:38,840
the increased vitamin D from getting Tan.

6269
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:39,531
Like,

6270
02:47:39,531 --> 02:47:39,860
um,

6271
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:41,930
I think Steve Maxwell told me about this,

6272
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:43,430
that they did some studies,

6273
02:47:43,431 --> 02:47:44,900
so get this last position.

6274
02:47:44,901 --> 02:47:45,800
These boys are scrapped.

6275
02:47:45,830 --> 02:47:46,520
Yeah.

6276
02:47:46,520 --> 02:47:49,190
I believe Steve Maxwell
told me that there's a,

6277
02:47:49,191 --> 02:47:52,200
there's physical benefits to uh,

6278
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:54,890
getting Tan being out in the sun.

6279
02:47:54,920 --> 02:47:55,101
Yeah.

6280
02:47:55,101 --> 02:47:55,980
Well not just that,

6281
02:47:56,560 --> 02:48:01,560
while you were Tan and your body's jacked
up on vitamin D from the exposure to

6282
02:48:02,001 --> 02:48:02,450
the sun,

6283
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:05,270
even I think probably not as good,

6284
02:48:05,271 --> 02:48:06,650
but better than nothing.

6285
02:48:06,651 --> 02:48:07,790
Exposure to a tanning bed.

6286
02:48:07,850 --> 02:48:08,480
That makes sense.

6287
02:48:08,480 --> 02:48:10,550
It actually can benefit you.

6288
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:13,580
It's really crazy that
your body makes up vitamin.

6289
02:48:13,820 --> 02:48:16,190
I know it's the only way you
can stuff getting sun rays.

6290
02:48:16,550 --> 02:48:16,791
Well,

6291
02:48:16,791 --> 02:48:18,770
there's other ways to get
it dietarily but you know,

6292
02:48:18,771 --> 02:48:23,210
most of the way you get it staring
at the sun or being in the sun.

6293
02:48:23,230 --> 02:48:24,063
It is crazy.

6294
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:25,093
Crazy.

6295
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:26,840
How bizarre is that?

6296
02:48:27,890 --> 02:48:28,161
God,

6297
02:48:28,161 --> 02:48:29,990
I wish one of these two
wind chocolate body.

6298
02:48:30,170 --> 02:48:30,910
Yeah.

6299
02:48:30,910 --> 02:48:31,131
What?

6300
02:48:31,131 --> 02:48:33,890
Imagine if a guy fought in the
UFC chocolate body and he's like,

6301
02:48:33,891 --> 02:48:34,161
Bro,

6302
02:48:34,161 --> 02:48:35,080
I got to get contracts.

6303
02:48:35,090 --> 02:48:35,990
I want to look ripped.

6304
02:48:36,740 --> 02:48:37,160
You know,

6305
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:38,150
he couldn't say anything.

6306
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:41,990
I see how guys who are fortunate enough
to have more melanin in their skin,

6307
02:48:42,230 --> 02:48:42,801
they look better.

6308
02:48:42,801 --> 02:48:43,970
They get more contracts.

6309
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:44,833
It's true.

6310
02:48:45,130 --> 02:48:46,640
He can't hold that shit back from me.

6311
02:48:46,910 --> 02:48:49,280
Like you remember when Chuck Ladell
used to paint his toenails and then

6312
02:48:49,281 --> 02:48:51,440
everybody wanted to paint
their toenails black?

6313
02:48:51,710 --> 02:48:53,210
I'm talking about black toes.

6314
02:48:53,240 --> 02:48:53,570
Yep.

6315
02:48:53,570 --> 02:48:58,570
All we need is one dude to go chocolate
body and everybody goes nuts and he gets

6316
02:48:59,451 --> 02:49:00,740
a big endorsement contract.

6317
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:05,180
We need North Carolina triggers
with the fucking beautiful kicks.

6318
02:49:05,650 --> 02:49:06,610
But grins Ahmond,

6319
02:49:06,611 --> 02:49:07,980
don't give a fuck about your

6320
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:08,813
kicks.

6321
02:49:09,510 --> 02:49:10,950
He's such a little monster.

6322
02:49:13,560 --> 02:49:15,240
Good defense there by area,

6323
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:16,130
but were Koreans.

6324
02:49:16,130 --> 02:49:16,600
Oh,

6325
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:17,190
try it again.

6326
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:17,730
Try it again.

6327
02:49:17,730 --> 02:49:19,710
But at the very least it's
allowing him to escape.

6328
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:19,981
Oh,

6329
02:49:19,981 --> 02:49:20,940
step in elbow.

6330
02:49:20,941 --> 02:49:22,440
Look at that as a creative dude.

6331
02:49:22,470 --> 02:49:22,920
Oo.

6332
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:23,121
Oh,

6333
02:49:23,121 --> 02:49:24,210
you can clip though.

6334
02:49:24,211 --> 02:49:24,630
Temple.

6335
02:49:24,630 --> 02:49:26,330
That right hand without the Zombie Dude.

6336
02:49:26,331 --> 02:49:28,140
He like you're flashy shit.

6337
02:49:28,141 --> 02:49:29,070
And just come forward.

6338
02:49:29,250 --> 02:49:33,240
Well in a lot of ways this is a real good
test for him after the Frankie fight.

6339
02:49:33,380 --> 02:49:34,470
Good test for both of them,

6340
02:49:34,471 --> 02:49:34,671
right?

6341
02:49:34,671 --> 02:49:35,504
Yes.

6342
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:36,353
What's matter?

6343
02:49:38,010 --> 02:49:39,900
Logo fighters definitely can't do that.

6344
02:49:40,090 --> 02:49:41,580
And fake 10 UFC fighter.

6345
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:43,380
Oh Sam Albi did.

6346
02:49:43,381 --> 02:49:44,340
Why did he do that?

6347
02:49:44,550 --> 02:49:47,160
2015 wow.

6348
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:52,190
You know the UFC had to make in a policy
about putting those fake tattoos on

6349
02:49:53,221 --> 02:49:54,900
your back that said like,

6350
02:49:54,901 --> 02:49:55,260
uh,

6351
02:49:55,260 --> 02:49:55,561
you know,

6352
02:49:55,561 --> 02:49:58,170
casino something.com and remember this,

6353
02:49:58,171 --> 02:49:58,591
we're doing it.

6354
02:49:58,591 --> 02:49:59,160
Yeah.

6355
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:01,410
I think Bernard Hopkins was
the first guy to do that.

6356
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:02,550
There's some guys who did that.

6357
02:50:02,551 --> 02:50:02,701
Yeah.

6358
02:50:02,701 --> 02:50:03,451
UFC can't do it.

6359
02:50:03,451 --> 02:50:04,500
You can't get tattoos,

6360
02:50:04,501 --> 02:50:04,651
you know,

6361
02:50:04,651 --> 02:50:05,461
that's in your contract.

6362
02:50:05,461 --> 02:50:06,900
No tattoos of logos.

6363
02:50:07,170 --> 02:50:07,710
Ah,

6364
02:50:07,710 --> 02:50:08,543
interesting.

6365
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:10,470
[inaudible] the air it on television.

6366
02:50:10,471 --> 02:50:11,281
No basketball too.

6367
02:50:11,281 --> 02:50:12,360
Like Jared Smith got like,

6368
02:50:12,361 --> 02:50:17,361
I think a supreme tattoo and that they
had to cover it up a large big ass

6369
02:50:17,761 --> 02:50:18,570
supreme debt.

6370
02:50:18,570 --> 02:50:20,550
Unless you have ownership
in that business.

6371
02:50:20,551 --> 02:50:21,540
Don't do that.

6372
02:50:21,570 --> 02:50:21,781
Yeah.

6373
02:50:21,781 --> 02:50:22,620
What is that about?

6374
02:50:22,621 --> 02:50:23,454
I don't know.

6375
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:24,580
He has so many tattoos.

6376
02:50:24,581 --> 02:50:24,991
He's probably like,

6377
02:50:24,991 --> 02:50:25,710
fuck.

6378
02:50:25,710 --> 02:50:26,041
He's like,

6379
02:50:26,041 --> 02:50:26,874
come on,

6380
02:50:27,330 --> 02:50:28,163
give me a free shit.

6381
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,070
That's what he's doing.

6382
02:50:29,070 --> 02:50:29,701
Is that what it is?

6383
02:50:29,701 --> 02:50:30,181
Wow.

6384
02:50:30,181 --> 02:50:32,550
He's got a right off the
back of the sick though.

6385
02:50:34,110 --> 02:50:34,681
Oh,

6386
02:50:34,681 --> 02:50:35,041
look at that.

6387
02:50:35,041 --> 02:50:35,251
Yeah,

6388
02:50:35,251 --> 02:50:36,180
you're spinning elbow.

6389
02:50:36,181 --> 02:50:37,200
That shit was nasty.

6390
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:38,520
Did you see that replay?

6391
02:50:39,300 --> 02:50:42,030
We should pay attention to as far we've
been talking about chocolate bodies.

6392
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:42,510
Yeah.

6393
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:43,710
I think we have a point though,

6394
02:50:43,860 --> 02:50:44,280
dude.

6395
02:50:44,280 --> 02:50:46,560
I feel like we're the first
ones really call it out.

6396
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:47,341
Yeah.

6397
02:50:47,341 --> 02:50:49,780
I've never heard before Jamie.

6398
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:51,290
I don't know.

6399
02:50:52,170 --> 02:50:55,240
There's probably a reason why there was
a bunch of them tagged together on a

6400
02:50:55,241 --> 02:50:55,880
website.

6401
02:50:55,880 --> 02:50:56,713
I'm sure.

6402
02:50:56,810 --> 02:50:57,250
True.

6403
02:50:57,250 --> 02:50:59,910
I just think it's hilarious when you
see the dudes who don't have chocolate

6404
02:50:59,911 --> 02:51:00,290
face,

6405
02:51:00,290 --> 02:51:01,290
they chocolate body.

6406
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:03,120
That's so weird looking.

6407
02:51:03,180 --> 02:51:06,690
It's just like you like your
face is just a normal color,

6408
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:07,740
but I get it.

6409
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:08,281
I get it.

6410
02:51:08,281 --> 02:51:10,380
It does make you look
more defined yet does.

6411
02:51:10,410 --> 02:51:12,810
When you're Tan you'd
definitely look more shredded.

6412
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:14,951
Oh Damn.

6413
02:51:14,951 --> 02:51:15,130
Yeah.

6414
02:51:15,130 --> 02:51:15,510
Here.

6415
02:51:15,510 --> 02:51:17,370
But the thing about it is like tanning,

6416
02:51:18,150 --> 02:51:19,200
there's not really good for you.

6417
02:51:19,201 --> 02:51:19,560
Right?

6418
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:20,490
Like get that dark.

6419
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:21,211
Not all the time.

6420
02:51:21,211 --> 02:51:21,600
Right.

6421
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,150
If you've got that dark fuck,

6422
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:23,881
they can't do it.

6423
02:51:23,881 --> 02:51:25,050
That's why they have to spray paint.

6424
02:51:26,220 --> 02:51:29,790
And also I would think that I wouldn't
be mad if Korean Zombie had somewhat of a

6425
02:51:29,791 --> 02:51:30,061
Tan,

6426
02:51:30,061 --> 02:51:30,870
but whatever.

6427
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:30,991
Oh,

6428
02:51:30,991 --> 02:51:31,824
how dare you.

6429
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:33,630
That's what it looks like Bro.

6430
02:51:34,290 --> 02:51:37,710
Cause we're creating going
for the sand it up dude.

6431
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:38,440
He does.

6432
02:51:38,440 --> 02:51:39,570
It's good head movement too.

6433
02:51:39,590 --> 02:51:40,200
He looks,

6434
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:40,711
he looks good.

6435
02:51:40,711 --> 02:51:41,830
Standing up dude.

6436
02:51:41,831 --> 02:51:44,330
To how fun of a fight would
have been for beat versus Ia.

6437
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:45,630
That's a motherfucking fight.

6438
02:51:45,930 --> 02:51:46,201
Yeah.

6439
02:51:46,201 --> 02:51:47,310
That would have been really good fight.

6440
02:51:47,610 --> 02:51:51,430
I don't like that fight
for as a beat or uh oh man.

6441
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:53,070
Nice right hand by the Korean Zombie.

6442
02:51:53,610 --> 02:51:54,211
Well A,

6443
02:51:54,211 --> 02:51:55,080
I like it for,

6444
02:51:55,081 --> 02:51:56,780
to see entertainment wise.

6445
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:58,140
I want to see what's up.

6446
02:51:58,650 --> 02:51:58,951
You know,

6447
02:51:58,951 --> 02:52:00,870
it's like a lot of people thought that uh,

6448
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:04,890
Mike Perry had it all day for cowboy and
cowboy just showed everybody what was

6449
02:52:04,891 --> 02:52:05,710
up tonight.

6450
02:52:05,710 --> 02:52:06,820
That's what's interesting.

6451
02:52:07,090 --> 02:52:07,390
Right?

6452
02:52:07,390 --> 02:52:07,561
You,

6453
02:52:07,561 --> 02:52:08,200
you know,

6454
02:52:08,200 --> 02:52:09,400
I want it for a long time.

6455
02:52:09,401 --> 02:52:10,750
We know what tub way brings,

6456
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:12,520
we don't know what Mike Perry brings.

6457
02:52:12,700 --> 02:52:13,241
We don't know what,

6458
02:52:13,241 --> 02:52:13,421
yeah,

6459
02:52:13,421 --> 02:52:15,220
you're or fuckings a beat bring.

6460
02:52:15,670 --> 02:52:18,310
We don't totally know what they bring,

6461
02:52:18,311 --> 02:52:20,620
but we've seen the flyer tested.

6462
02:52:20,650 --> 02:52:20,930
Yeah.

6463
02:52:20,930 --> 02:52:21,550
Yeah,

6464
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:22,151
we've seen,

6465
02:52:22,151 --> 02:52:22,361
yeah,

6466
02:52:22,361 --> 02:52:24,130
you're tested against Frankie.

6467
02:52:24,460 --> 02:52:25,900
Frankie Edgar just destroyed.

6468
02:52:25,930 --> 02:52:29,630
There was even a test that we test
you just like you're not a lot of,

6469
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:32,170
what is this?

6470
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:33,850
What's going on with the left picture?

6471
02:52:34,450 --> 02:52:35,680
I can't put that on youtube,

6472
02:52:35,681 --> 02:52:38,110
but what is that left
pictures that a guy or girl,

6473
02:52:38,170 --> 02:52:39,003
what's a woman?

6474
02:52:39,250 --> 02:52:40,580
How come she doesn't have a shirt on a,

6475
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:41,433
she allowed to,

6476
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:42,273
this is the door.

6477
02:52:42,430 --> 02:52:43,930
An artist photographer,

6478
02:52:43,931 --> 02:52:48,930
a photographer did like a
series of photos on the subject,

6479
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:49,400
dude.

6480
02:52:49,400 --> 02:52:51,160
That a transgender,

6481
02:52:51,210 --> 02:52:51,451
no,

6482
02:52:51,451 --> 02:52:51,971
no.

6483
02:52:51,971 --> 02:52:53,020
Son of a bitch.

6484
02:52:53,050 --> 02:52:55,300
How dare that's a transgender
woman on the left.

6485
02:52:55,320 --> 02:52:55,431
No,

6486
02:52:55,431 --> 02:52:55,581
no,

6487
02:52:55,581 --> 02:52:55,690
no.

6488
02:52:55,690 --> 02:52:57,400
That's a woman who's um,

6489
02:52:59,020 --> 02:53:04,020
how shall we put this in a lot of muscle
that was not a woman and the titties

6490
02:53:05,501 --> 02:53:06,160
like that.

6491
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:07,330
Those are implants.

6492
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:07,601
No,

6493
02:53:07,601 --> 02:53:08,650
it's a woman that's hooked up.

6494
02:53:08,910 --> 02:53:10,630
They did the titties or implants.

6495
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:11,170
Right.

6496
02:53:11,170 --> 02:53:12,280
But my point is like,

6497
02:53:12,281 --> 02:53:13,660
that looks like,

6498
02:53:14,170 --> 02:53:19,170
like her body and her proportions
look like that's a man like up

6499
02:53:22,810 --> 02:53:24,640
like a different kind of thing.

6500
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:27,160
If that came up to you as a
lady boy and telling him like,

6501
02:53:27,161 --> 02:53:27,570
Bro,

6502
02:53:27,570 --> 02:53:29,440
the fuck Outta here do better,

6503
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:30,700
but this is what I'm thinking.

6504
02:53:31,270 --> 02:53:33,910
She looks like she can be piecing them up.

6505
02:53:34,060 --> 02:53:34,420
Is She,

6506
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:34,810
is he,

6507
02:53:34,810 --> 02:53:35,060
Oh,

6508
02:53:35,060 --> 02:53:36,040
dad's going after him.

6509
02:53:36,100 --> 02:53:36,490
Yeah.

6510
02:53:36,490 --> 02:53:38,970
She looks like she could be like uh,

6511
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:41,950
a type of human that
evolved on a nearby star.

6512
02:53:42,700 --> 02:53:44,470
She looks like Steve Nash with tits.

6513
02:53:44,471 --> 02:53:45,100
Am I right?

6514
02:53:45,100 --> 02:53:49,180
Like a type of human and evolved in a
nearby galaxy that's super similar to us.

6515
02:53:49,630 --> 02:53:50,650
I don't know Bro.

6516
02:53:50,710 --> 02:53:52,120
Hopefully not while the,

6517
02:53:52,150 --> 02:53:53,350
the implant,

6518
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:53,890
right.

6519
02:53:53,890 --> 02:53:55,180
If that wasn't an implant,

6520
02:53:55,210 --> 02:53:56,650
if that's just what the breasts look like,

6521
02:53:57,130 --> 02:53:58,660
just super muscular on top.

6522
02:53:58,660 --> 02:54:00,670
Just like a guy super jacked.

6523
02:54:00,671 --> 02:54:01,840
It looks like a rugby player.

6524
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:05,080
And then you get to the titties
and these weird sort of um,

6525
02:54:06,550 --> 02:54:07,720
bulbous bags.

6526
02:54:07,721 --> 02:54:09,160
Maybe their horns or something.

6527
02:54:10,150 --> 02:54:12,370
Hard rocks that they use for chess,

6528
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:13,420
Bang and battle.

6529
02:54:14,680 --> 02:54:15,161
God,

6530
02:54:15,161 --> 02:54:15,251
I,

6531
02:54:15,251 --> 02:54:16,870
that's a tough call jacked.

6532
02:54:17,140 --> 02:54:18,820
But that's not a classic female physique,

6533
02:54:18,850 --> 02:54:19,470
that's for sure.

6534
02:54:19,470 --> 02:54:20,470
I like the nails though.

6535
02:54:21,100 --> 02:54:22,690
Long white nails are strong touch.

6536
02:54:22,691 --> 02:54:23,524
Go back to that Jamie.

6537
02:54:24,210 --> 02:54:27,630
If there was any doubt whatsoever
about the feminine energy.

6538
02:54:28,570 --> 02:54:28,990
Yeah,

6539
02:54:28,990 --> 02:54:30,820
we them nails powerful.

6540
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:31,600
I'll tell you though,

6541
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:35,640
that's a main demon hands at and David.

6542
02:54:35,750 --> 02:54:39,820
Oh full of veins and thick looked like
they'd been just lifting heavy shit for

6543
02:54:39,821 --> 02:54:40,630
years.

6544
02:54:40,630 --> 02:54:41,321
Jerking off,

6545
02:54:41,321 --> 02:54:42,154
dude.

6546
02:54:42,190 --> 02:54:42,821
Boom,

6547
02:54:42,821 --> 02:54:43,750
boom.

6548
02:54:44,590 --> 02:54:45,423
Yeah,

6549
02:54:45,670 --> 02:54:46,361
but hey man,

6550
02:54:46,361 --> 02:54:47,350
if that's how she wants to look,

6551
02:54:47,570 --> 02:54:48,460
I don't give a shit.

6552
02:54:48,461 --> 02:54:48,941
Do your thing,

6553
02:54:48,941 --> 02:54:49,620
girl.

6554
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:51,820
People that love to get jacked,

6555
02:54:51,880 --> 02:54:53,640
they love to just be preposterously.

6556
02:54:54,130 --> 02:54:54,963
Whew.

6557
02:54:55,450 --> 02:54:57,580
That lady total chocolate face.

6558
02:54:57,610 --> 02:54:58,443
How dare you?

6559
02:54:58,470 --> 02:55:01,260
That is the most chocolate face.

6560
02:55:01,670 --> 02:55:04,160
She's dark chocolate
face to need a new chalk.

6561
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:05,420
Full coke.

6562
02:55:06,130 --> 02:55:07,940
She looks damn dude.

6563
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,680
If she was on the Meghan Kelly Shelf,

6564
02:55:09,681 --> 02:55:10,880
she walked out in the background,

6565
02:55:10,881 --> 02:55:13,550
started posing right when Megan
was talking about blackface,

6566
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:17,100
the whole world.

6567
02:55:19,450 --> 02:55:19,770
Wait,

6568
02:55:19,770 --> 02:55:19,990
wait,

6569
02:55:19,990 --> 02:55:20,171
wait,

6570
02:55:20,171 --> 02:55:20,400
wait,

6571
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:21,010
wait.

6572
02:55:21,010 --> 02:55:22,030
That's okay.

6573
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:23,463
Hold on.

6574
02:55:24,310 --> 02:55:24,970
Okay.

6575
02:55:24,970 --> 02:55:27,700
She's a fitness cows or you got your guy.

6576
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:29,800
It's okay bro.

6577
02:55:29,860 --> 02:55:32,270
It's a fitness [inaudible]
Olympia next week.

6578
02:55:32,530 --> 02:55:34,480
I'm just showing you how rip my face is.

6579
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:41,270
Yeah.

6580
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:42,930
My face is shredded as fuck,

6581
02:55:43,580 --> 02:55:43,791
dude.

6582
02:55:43,791 --> 02:55:46,250
I'm trying to show off my
jaw muscles right here.

6583
02:55:46,251 --> 02:55:48,320
I guess I chew gum all day Bro.

6584
02:55:48,321 --> 02:55:49,190
When I want to stop,

6585
02:55:49,191 --> 02:55:54,191
I don't of my fucking cheeks or has
wrapped and it just makes zero sense.

6586
02:55:54,471 --> 02:55:57,180
My face is chocolate
faces lift for a look at,

6587
02:55:57,220 --> 02:55:59,030
oh I have to bro.

6588
02:55:59,620 --> 02:56:00,453
Getting that face.

6589
02:56:01,020 --> 02:56:01,853
Oh Hey

6590
02:56:01,950 --> 02:56:02,783
fella,

6591
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:07,240
you can't do that as an aboriginal
woman in a man's not do that

6592
02:56:08,930 --> 02:56:12,770
and someone has to translate the white
man's language too about that is you got

6593
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:13,171
a guy,

6594
02:56:13,171 --> 02:56:17,010
why are we giving white
people are looking for gold.

6595
02:56:17,030 --> 02:56:20,180
That's exactly like do you have boom,

6596
02:56:20,990 --> 02:56:21,460
boom,

6597
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:22,293
go.

6598
02:56:23,010 --> 02:56:24,540
Oh how dare you sir.

6599
02:56:24,810 --> 02:56:28,050
How many people just want to wear a
black face cause they're super racist and

6600
02:56:28,051 --> 02:56:29,670
they can't so they become body builders.

6601
02:56:30,690 --> 02:56:31,800
Is that happen dude?

6602
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:34,020
I'm not saying it happens a lot,

6603
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:35,220
but it enough for you.

6604
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:39,930
Has It happened once as one guy but
just to fucking bodybuilder bro.

6605
02:56:39,990 --> 02:56:40,490

6606
02:56:40,490 --> 02:56:41,540

6607
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:41,881

6608
02:56:41,881 --> 02:56:42,601

02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:56,960

6617
02:56:59,320 --> 02:57:00,640
How is that acceptable?

6618
02:57:00,670 --> 02:57:02,140
How is that possible?

6619
02:57:02,141 --> 02:57:02,974
Oh,

6620
02:57:03,110 --> 02:57:03,950
that guy.

6621
02:57:04,130 --> 02:57:06,920
It looks like somebody sprayed ANC on him.

6622
02:57:07,130 --> 02:57:07,550
Dude.

6623
02:57:07,550 --> 02:57:08,151
You know hard.

6624
02:57:08,151 --> 02:57:11,240
That shit is to get off to do
these bullshit competition.

6625
02:57:11,270 --> 02:57:12,081
That guy looks like,

6626
02:57:12,081 --> 02:57:12,651
here's this.

6627
02:57:12,651 --> 02:57:14,030
They fell in an oil.

6628
02:57:14,031 --> 02:57:14,790
Well,

6629
02:57:14,790 --> 02:57:15,141
you know,

6630
02:57:15,141 --> 02:57:15,741
unhealthy.

6631
02:57:15,741 --> 02:57:16,610
Those people are,

6632
02:57:17,240 --> 02:57:19,310
you're the catalyst and it
looks like you fell in oil.

6633
02:57:19,340 --> 02:57:19,671
He liked,

6634
02:57:19,671 --> 02:57:20,900
they pull them out of an oil.

6635
02:57:20,901 --> 02:57:21,540
Well,

6636
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:21,970
I go,

6637
02:57:21,970 --> 02:57:22,491
I was in there.

6638
02:57:22,491 --> 02:57:23,090
I had a restaurant,

6639
02:57:23,090 --> 02:57:24,380
a kid he went under,

6640
02:57:25,940 --> 02:57:28,880
he went under and save somebody
and he's a goddamn hero.

6641
02:57:28,970 --> 02:57:29,240
And you're,

6642
02:57:29,240 --> 02:57:30,970
you don't have to be black.

6643
02:57:31,010 --> 02:57:31,311
What's it?

6644
02:57:31,311 --> 02:57:31,701
Okay.

6645
02:57:31,701 --> 02:57:32,690
Whoa.

6646
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:34,250
That guy might be black.

6647
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:34,940
I think so.

6648
02:57:34,940 --> 02:57:39,170
How do you know Jamie don't get
racist on is Jamie Jesus hairs?

6649
02:57:39,220 --> 02:57:40,053
Isn't that funny?

6650
02:57:40,070 --> 02:57:40,903
That you can get,

6651
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:42,410
that would make you racist.

6652
02:57:42,620 --> 02:57:46,490
Like if you thought that one of these
guys in chocolate face and chocolate skin

6653
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:47,331
and chocolate body,

6654
02:57:47,331 --> 02:57:49,220
if you thought one of
those guys wasn't doing it,

6655
02:57:49,340 --> 02:57:51,430
what the fuck you feel you are racist.

6656
02:57:51,660 --> 02:57:51,790
Like,

6657
02:57:51,790 --> 02:57:52,131
oh my God,

6658
02:57:52,131 --> 02:57:53,270
that's his real color shifts.

6659
02:57:53,540 --> 02:57:53,760
It's,

6660
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:55,400
it's more the women do it too though,

6661
02:57:55,401 --> 02:57:55,641
right?

6662
02:57:55,641 --> 02:57:56,120
Jamie?

6663
02:57:56,120 --> 02:57:57,320
It's more of a man thing.

6664
02:57:57,800 --> 02:57:58,251
Oh No,

6665
02:57:58,251 --> 02:57:58,520
the,

6666
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:59,750
the women do it for sure.

6667
02:57:59,780 --> 02:57:59,901
I mean,

6668
02:57:59,901 --> 02:58:00,380
I'll see.

6669
02:58:00,380 --> 02:58:01,213
Ah Dude.

6670
02:58:01,290 --> 02:58:02,460
Oh

6671
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:03,773
Hey,

6672
02:58:05,250 --> 02:58:06,810
what are you showing me man?

6673
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:11,550
He keeps it up to the creepy
out look Latina girls.

6674
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:13,950
I just can't man do this.

6675
02:58:13,951 --> 02:58:16,650
Round four we talked about this
fight for a total of 20 seconds.

6676
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:19,860
Looks like it's good to
fucking chocolate bodies.

6677
02:58:19,940 --> 02:58:22,890
Fucking up the middle by ya here.

6678
02:58:23,070 --> 02:58:25,530
Once a Korean zombies forced to
find in the outside like this,

6679
02:58:25,531 --> 02:58:25,850
then yeah.

6680
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:29,430
Or his kicks become more dangerous and
that's shit like spinning back fist

6681
02:58:29,431 --> 02:58:30,330
because you don't know which,

6682
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:31,253
what's coming.

6683
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:32,400
So he doesn't know where the,

6684
02:58:32,660 --> 02:58:33,610
where the distance is,

6685
02:58:33,611 --> 02:58:34,444
where he's safe.

6686
02:58:34,530 --> 02:58:38,820
It doesn't need to land a real clean
one to stop the Zombie cause he does not

6687
02:58:38,821 --> 02:58:41,450
fucking studies the Zombie two.

6688
02:58:41,460 --> 02:58:41,791
Nice.

6689
02:58:41,791 --> 02:58:42,624
Right hands.

6690
02:58:42,810 --> 02:58:43,110
Ooh,

6691
02:58:43,110 --> 02:58:43,410
he's,

6692
02:58:43,410 --> 02:58:44,250
he's hunted him down.

6693
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:44,880
Oh yeah.

6694
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:45,270
Yeah.

6695
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:46,103
Oh Shit.

6696
02:58:46,410 --> 02:58:46,981
Oh Shit.

6697
02:58:46,981 --> 02:58:49,140
Oh I think he fell there though.

6698
02:58:49,240 --> 02:58:50,073
I definitely fell

6699
02:58:51,550 --> 02:58:52,290
filing right now.

6700
02:58:52,290 --> 02:58:53,670
Good job chasing after him,

6701
02:58:53,671 --> 02:58:54,690
but I think he fell.

6702
02:58:55,080 --> 02:58:56,700
Oh Nice Jab.

6703
02:58:57,590 --> 02:58:57,901
Damn.

6704
02:58:57,901 --> 02:58:58,081
Yeah.

6705
02:58:58,081 --> 02:58:59,100
Here's bloodied up.

6706
02:58:59,240 --> 02:58:59,430
Yeah,

6707
02:58:59,430 --> 02:59:00,890
they're beating each other
up or there's another nice,

6708
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:02,580
nice left hand Korean Zombie.

6709
02:59:02,581 --> 02:59:04,260
Switching up from right hand or left hand?

6710
02:59:04,350 --> 02:59:05,430
Both fucked up.

6711
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,110
Bump their noses look broke.

6712
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:07,951
Yeah,

6713
02:59:07,951 --> 02:59:08,240
they're,

6714
02:59:08,240 --> 02:59:09,500
they're beat up Korean zombies.

6715
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:11,520
Got some shots with his nose,

6716
02:59:11,521 --> 02:59:12,870
but I think with his lip right here.

6717
02:59:12,871 --> 02:59:13,620
His upper lip?

6718
02:59:13,620 --> 02:59:13,980
Yeah.

6719
02:59:13,980 --> 02:59:14,221
Oh,

6720
02:59:14,221 --> 02:59:15,310
we just want to build there.

6721
02:59:15,360 --> 02:59:16,590
He just threw that punch and a wiggle.

6722
02:59:17,070 --> 02:59:17,781
Oh Shit.

6723
02:59:17,781 --> 02:59:21,060
He just playing to remember what Korean
Zombie just dipped out for four years to

6724
02:59:21,061 --> 02:59:22,080
serve in Korea.

6725
02:59:22,230 --> 02:59:23,780
Military have to,

6726
02:59:23,820 --> 02:59:24,001
yeah.

6727
02:59:24,001 --> 02:59:24,811
It was a few years.

6728
02:59:24,811 --> 02:59:25,561
How many years was it?

6729
02:59:25,561 --> 02:59:26,220
Was it four?

6730
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:27,053
Four?

6731
02:59:27,240 --> 02:59:27,391
He,

6732
02:59:27,391 --> 02:59:28,680
I remember he was gone for four years.

6733
02:59:28,681 --> 02:59:31,620
Then beat Dennis Bermudez I
think to his lip is fucked up.

6734
02:59:31,621 --> 02:59:33,210
I think he kao Dennis Bermudez.

6735
02:59:33,240 --> 02:59:33,811
Oh y'all.

6736
02:59:33,811 --> 02:59:36,330
You're popped him with the
jab right on that mouth.

6737
02:59:37,440 --> 02:59:38,273
I think he's got,

6738
02:59:38,290 --> 02:59:40,620
he's got some issues going
on with that upper lip man.

6739
02:59:41,160 --> 02:59:41,980
We've seen that before.

6740
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:43,050
Were lip splits.

6741
02:59:44,710 --> 02:59:45,770
You seen chocolate?

6742
02:59:45,780 --> 02:59:47,100
Dell's when he fought rich Franklin,

6743
02:59:47,101 --> 02:59:49,250
that was the worst I've ever
seen is probably the worst.

6744
02:59:49,251 --> 02:59:49,770
All right.

6745
02:59:49,770 --> 02:59:50,540
Close to four years.

6746
02:59:50,540 --> 02:59:51,373
Jamie.

6747
02:59:52,060 --> 02:59:52,980
She missed four years.

6748
02:59:52,981 --> 02:59:54,040
I think he served too,

6749
02:59:54,480 --> 02:59:55,710
but he missed four years in the AFC.

6750
02:59:55,711 --> 02:59:57,340
Then came back beat Dennis Bermudez.

6751
02:59:58,360 --> 02:59:59,010
What happened?

6752
02:59:59,010 --> 03:00:00,810
Korean Zombie just hit
him with a big right hand.

6753
03:00:00,811 --> 03:00:02,670
Fuck big right hand.

6754
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:04,230
He's yelling something.

6755
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:05,520
He's saying he's doing something.

6756
03:00:05,740 --> 03:00:06,630
He's holding his glove.

6757
03:00:07,060 --> 03:00:09,980
He said something through
did it wobble yet.

6758
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:10,650
Yay.

6759
03:00:10,650 --> 03:00:11,310
Cracked him.

6760
03:00:11,310 --> 03:00:11,881
He cracked him.

6761
03:00:11,881 --> 03:00:13,360
Could it was a good shot.

6762
03:00:13,370 --> 03:00:14,940
Fucking Zombie man.

6763
03:00:15,330 --> 03:00:16,860
Remember his bad ass walk out shirt.

6764
03:00:17,070 --> 03:00:17,161
Oh,

6765
03:00:17,161 --> 03:00:18,410
he's saying he hit him
in the nuts or is yeah,

6766
03:00:18,411 --> 03:00:19,800
you're looking for for a break.

6767
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:22,350
They're not stopping it for that.

6768
03:00:22,410 --> 03:00:23,101
I'll come on.

6769
03:00:23,101 --> 03:00:25,080
Go Korean Zombie.

6770
03:00:25,320 --> 03:00:25,680
Wow.

6771
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:26,580
Let's take no racist.

6772
03:00:26,630 --> 03:00:26,970
I don't,

6773
03:00:26,970 --> 03:00:27,803
I didn't see that.

6774
03:00:28,440 --> 03:00:29,370
Did you see what happened?

6775
03:00:30,060 --> 03:00:30,720
Uh,

6776
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:31,590
Zaire was complaining.

6777
03:00:31,591 --> 03:00:33,210
They get hit in the nuts
and kept looking at the ref.

6778
03:00:33,211 --> 03:00:33,661
What do you see?

6779
03:00:33,661 --> 03:00:35,560
What happened that made
him say get hitting them

6780
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:37,993
dude,

6781
03:00:38,040 --> 03:00:39,150
but if the ref doesn't stop,

6782
03:00:39,151 --> 03:00:39,391
I mean,

6783
03:00:39,391 --> 03:00:40,224
come on dude.

6784
03:00:40,230 --> 03:00:41,930
They're probably both
exhausts you can see by.

6785
03:00:41,940 --> 03:00:42,630
Come on.

6786
03:00:42,630 --> 03:00:43,463
Give us a break.

6787
03:00:45,210 --> 03:00:45,331
Well,

6788
03:00:45,331 --> 03:00:45,810
they're both,

6789
03:00:45,810 --> 03:00:48,000
they've taken a lot of palm
trees from Korean Zombie.

6790
03:00:48,001 --> 03:00:49,260
Looks like a different person

6791
03:00:51,440 --> 03:00:52,021
and so does he.

6792
03:00:52,021 --> 03:00:53,130
I hear he's covered in blood.

6793
03:00:53,190 --> 03:00:54,490
Oh and right head.

6794
03:00:54,510 --> 03:00:55,343
Beautiful left hand.

6795
03:00:55,880 --> 03:00:57,690
It looks like one of those
hyenas when they're done,

6796
03:00:57,720 --> 03:01:00,910
when they're eating right and they doing
right through a water hogs asshole.

6797
03:01:00,940 --> 03:01:01,650
Yes.

6798
03:01:01,650 --> 03:01:03,040
Like a fucking water.

6799
03:01:03,070 --> 03:01:03,311
Yeah.

6800
03:01:03,311 --> 03:01:04,450
Water Buffaloes Dick.

6801
03:01:04,910 --> 03:01:05,300
Yes.

6802
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:06,310
Face is all red.

6803
03:01:06,311 --> 03:01:08,220
Like some like a waterpik.

6804
03:01:08,250 --> 03:01:08,830
Yeah,

6805
03:01:08,830 --> 03:01:13,830
some kind of will the beast looking
like a fucking butthole Hyena man.

6806
03:01:15,420 --> 03:01:16,360
You see a wart hog?

6807
03:01:17,140 --> 03:01:17,480
Yeah,

6808
03:01:17,480 --> 03:01:18,670
I've seen a word hung up close.

6809
03:01:18,690 --> 03:01:21,220
I don't fucking weird
looking animal that you ever,

6810
03:01:21,221 --> 03:01:21,881
you ever watch on,

6811
03:01:21,881 --> 03:01:23,680
I forget what the w nature metal.

6812
03:01:23,681 --> 03:01:24,431
Where the fuck it is.

6813
03:01:24,431 --> 03:01:25,480
We both wanted to go.

6814
03:01:25,481 --> 03:01:25,890
Yeah.

6815
03:01:25,890 --> 03:01:27,040
Nature's was like a Hyena.

6816
03:01:27,041 --> 03:01:30,970
Rick on the fucking water buffaloes to
kick off and it has a sense of material.

6817
03:01:30,971 --> 03:01:31,190
I'm like,

6818
03:01:31,190 --> 03:01:32,650
I'll watch it five in the morning.

6819
03:01:32,680 --> 03:01:33,910
Like God damn it.

6820
03:01:34,150 --> 03:01:38,680
It's like a zebra got his fucking air
starched off by a fucking eagle or

6821
03:01:38,681 --> 03:01:39,130
something.

6822
03:01:39,130 --> 03:01:44,130
James Vick posted something on Instagram
cause you know James Vick has been a

6823
03:01:44,350 --> 03:01:45,310
pig hunting lately.

6824
03:01:45,770 --> 03:01:46,210
Yeah.

6825
03:01:46,210 --> 03:01:46,720
And uh,

6826
03:01:46,720 --> 03:01:51,720
he posted this video of a pig eating a
deer and you watch it like a boar wild

6827
03:01:52,871 --> 03:01:53,460
pig.

6828
03:01:53,460 --> 03:01:54,880
It doesn't necessarily have to be a board,

6829
03:01:54,881 --> 03:01:55,400
eat a deer.

6830
03:01:55,400 --> 03:01:56,680
It could be a wild female.

6831
03:01:56,830 --> 03:01:58,060
So when you think of wild boar,

6832
03:01:58,061 --> 03:01:59,680
people think of like a different thing.

6833
03:02:00,580 --> 03:02:00,940
Yeah,

6834
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:01,990
that's just a male.

6835
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:02,913
Oh yeah.

6836
03:02:03,380 --> 03:02:03,670
So,

6837
03:02:03,670 --> 03:02:04,503
but I think,

6838
03:02:04,630 --> 03:02:07,390
but a bore isn't the same
as the pig that we eat.

6839
03:02:07,391 --> 03:02:08,310
The pink piggies.

6840
03:02:08,340 --> 03:02:11,350
They're like dads where it gets strange
because they're actually all the same

6841
03:02:11,351 --> 03:02:12,184
species.

6842
03:02:12,370 --> 03:02:12,941
Oh Damn.

6843
03:02:12,941 --> 03:02:13,680
I did not know that.

6844
03:02:13,680 --> 03:02:17,110
They do looks different here for noses.

6845
03:02:17,111 --> 03:02:17,860
They're gnarly.

6846
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:18,310
Yup.

6847
03:02:18,310 --> 03:02:20,390
They're different in where
they come from to be rocks.

6848
03:02:20,920 --> 03:02:22,030
If they're in like Russia,

6849
03:02:22,031 --> 03:02:27,031
like Russian bores and the bigger are
all considered among the same genus,

6850
03:02:27,370 --> 03:02:28,330
I think they call it.

6851
03:02:28,331 --> 03:02:29,081
They say genus.

6852
03:02:29,081 --> 03:02:29,590
Is that what you said,

6853
03:02:29,590 --> 03:02:30,460
Janice or Gina's?

6854
03:02:30,500 --> 03:02:31,333
How do you say that?

6855
03:02:32,310 --> 03:02:33,730
Steve or Noah told me all this.

6856
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:38,760
It's an animal species called [inaudible]
and that's what pigs are the same

6857
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:42,890
ladies that you're saying
the eagles different.

6858
03:02:43,260 --> 03:02:43,781
Very different.

6859
03:02:43,781 --> 03:02:44,261
Very different.

6860
03:02:44,261 --> 03:02:46,570
Because when you leave
pigs out in the wild,

6861
03:02:46,930 --> 03:02:47,111
see,

6862
03:02:47,111 --> 03:02:47,944
there it is right there.

6863
03:02:48,070 --> 03:02:49,010
What are the differences in the border?

6864
03:02:49,030 --> 03:02:52,270
Willdabeast while the pigs
called the bore underrated man.

6865
03:02:52,450 --> 03:02:53,283
That's just,

6866
03:02:53,670 --> 03:02:53,971
yeah,

6867
03:02:53,971 --> 03:02:54,551
it says it right here.

6868
03:02:54,551 --> 03:02:55,720
It doesn't talk about
the other piece of that.

6869
03:02:56,650 --> 03:02:57,580
Uh,

6870
03:02:57,640 --> 03:02:58,473
okay.

6871
03:02:58,920 --> 03:02:59,530
What does it say?

6872
03:02:59,530 --> 03:03:01,110
A wild pig could be called the board,

6873
03:03:01,120 --> 03:03:02,230
but that's just the name of it.

6874
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:03,010
Pig.

6875
03:03:03,010 --> 03:03:04,300
European wild boar.

6876
03:03:04,660 --> 03:03:05,170
Yeah.

6877
03:03:05,170 --> 03:03:06,003
Um,

6878
03:03:06,220 --> 03:03:07,000
but what are the,

6879
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:07,570
what is,

6880
03:03:07,570 --> 03:03:08,800
this is what the question is,

6881
03:03:08,801 --> 03:03:09,634
right?

6882
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:13,510
What's the difference between
wild pigs and domesticated pigs?

6883
03:03:13,860 --> 03:03:17,830
Pig pig in the w in the more
think a pig is the same family.

6884
03:03:17,831 --> 03:03:18,730
It's the same thing.

6885
03:03:18,970 --> 03:03:19,061
Oh,

6886
03:03:19,061 --> 03:03:20,240
there it is a boy.

6887
03:03:20,290 --> 03:03:20,561
Yeah.

6888
03:03:20,561 --> 03:03:21,460
An castrated male.

6889
03:03:21,461 --> 03:03:22,294
Domestic pig.

6890
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:24,730
That's just the term war.

6891
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:25,613
Uh,

6892
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:28,270
wild boar when I'm asking is,

6893
03:03:28,900 --> 03:03:31,540
is a pig in a wild pig,

6894
03:03:31,630 --> 03:03:33,070
a domesticated pig in a wild pig?

6895
03:03:33,071 --> 03:03:34,210
What's the difference between them?

6896
03:03:34,390 --> 03:03:35,830
I don't think there really is.

6897
03:03:36,070 --> 03:03:37,120
I think they're the same thing.

6898
03:03:37,121 --> 03:03:41,410
It's just they bred one and turned it
into this like real soft sort of thing.

6899
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:43,000
But when they get wild,

6900
03:03:43,810 --> 03:03:45,430
their body actually morphs the,

6901
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:45,701
yeah,

6902
03:03:45,701 --> 03:03:46,780
they're not pink in the wild.

6903
03:03:46,781 --> 03:03:48,490
They get fucked up right now.

6904
03:03:48,491 --> 03:03:48,701
They're,

6905
03:03:48,701 --> 03:03:51,400
they literally have
changes to their anatomy.

6906
03:03:51,430 --> 03:03:52,690
Their nose grows,

6907
03:03:52,870 --> 03:03:54,070
their mouth lengthens,

6908
03:03:54,100 --> 03:03:55,700
their teeth grow out there,

6909
03:03:55,710 --> 03:03:59,780
their hair gets thicker and it
happens just after a few months.

6910
03:04:02,320 --> 03:04:02,800
Yeah,

6911
03:04:02,800 --> 03:04:03,633
I know what the,

6912
03:04:03,730 --> 03:04:04,640
the girls,

6913
03:04:05,360 --> 03:04:09,730
there's a wild pig is just both wants to
Twila and then a regular razor back is,

6914
03:04:09,740 --> 03:04:10,573
uh,

6915
03:04:10,820 --> 03:04:12,040
it's not the answer to my question.

6916
03:04:12,041 --> 03:04:12,400
No,

6917
03:04:12,400 --> 03:04:15,940
they call it the question is what is
the difference between a wild pig and a

6918
03:04:15,941 --> 03:04:17,290
domesticated pig?

6919
03:04:18,370 --> 03:04:19,480
Did they have that on there?

6920
03:04:20,620 --> 03:04:21,453
Okay.

6921
03:04:21,460 --> 03:04:21,971
Google,

6922
03:04:21,971 --> 03:04:25,330
what's the difference between a
wild pig versus domesticated pig?

6923
03:04:28,050 --> 03:04:28,530
Yeah,

6924
03:04:28,530 --> 03:04:30,870
let's see what their piggy,

6925
03:04:30,990 --> 03:04:31,141
yeah,

6926
03:04:31,141 --> 03:04:34,860
we go a pig hog and board
essentially describe the same animal,

6927
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:36,330
but there are some distinctions,

6928
03:04:36,590 --> 03:04:38,910
a bores and uncast
treated male domestic pig.

6929
03:04:38,911 --> 03:04:40,950
But it also means a
wild pig of any gender.

6930
03:04:40,951 --> 03:04:41,900
A hog off means.

6931
03:04:42,150 --> 03:04:42,983
Okay.

6932
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:44,730
If we go deeper into it,

6933
03:04:44,731 --> 03:04:48,350
I'm pretty sure that it says that
they're a part of something called Sue

6934
03:04:48,350 --> 03:04:49,160
Scrofani.

6935
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:50,790
And Sue's Crawford is the,

6936
03:04:50,791 --> 03:04:51,450
uh,

6937
03:04:51,450 --> 03:04:53,910
the group that includes wild pigs,

6938
03:04:53,911 --> 03:04:55,020
domesticated pigs,

6939
03:04:55,410 --> 03:04:56,430
all those different animals.

6940
03:04:58,380 --> 03:04:59,520
But when you let them go wild,

6941
03:05:00,390 --> 03:05:00,751
they,

6942
03:05:00,751 --> 03:05:01,050
uh,

6943
03:05:01,050 --> 03:05:02,610
they literally change where they are.

6944
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:03,980
So sue scruff up.

6945
03:05:03,990 --> 03:05:04,823
That's it.

6946
03:05:04,950 --> 03:05:06,390
So it is kind of the same thing.

6947
03:05:06,391 --> 03:05:08,730
It's just they look different
in different places,

6948
03:05:09,180 --> 03:05:10,200
but they're the same thing.

6949
03:05:10,270 --> 03:05:10,490
Dude.

6950
03:05:10,490 --> 03:05:12,540
My son was playing with two baby pigs.

6951
03:05:12,690 --> 03:05:13,740
They're eight weeks old.

6952
03:05:13,741 --> 03:05:14,210
Got Dan.

6953
03:05:14,210 --> 03:05:15,480
They were cute or adorable.

6954
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:15,871
God,

6955
03:05:15,871 --> 03:05:17,550
they're cute when you
see them in the wild,

6956
03:05:17,551 --> 03:05:18,384
they're so different.

6957
03:05:18,480 --> 03:05:20,790
It's such a ruthlessly
aggressive little thing.

6958
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:21,440
Really.

6959
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:22,380
So you want to kill him?

6960
03:05:22,530 --> 03:05:22,741
Well,

6961
03:05:22,741 --> 03:05:23,451
they're creepy.

6962
03:05:23,451 --> 03:05:23,820
They,

6963
03:05:23,820 --> 03:05:25,530
I remember the first
time I ever hunted them,

6964
03:05:26,430 --> 03:05:30,360
I was with Rinella and we were walking
past this field and the grass was the

6965
03:05:30,361 --> 03:05:30,840
brush.

6966
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:33,090
Everything was very thick
and it was really high.

6967
03:05:33,091 --> 03:05:36,720
It was like a much
taller than their backs.

6968
03:05:37,410 --> 03:05:38,250
So if a pig is,

6969
03:05:38,460 --> 03:05:38,651
you know,

6970
03:05:38,651 --> 03:05:39,451
like a couple feet tall,

6971
03:05:39,451 --> 03:05:40,650
the grass was probably like five,

6972
03:05:40,651 --> 03:05:42,420
six feet tall because she
couldn't see where they were.

6973
03:05:42,660 --> 03:05:43,590
But you hear him in there

6974
03:05:47,130 --> 03:05:48,510
going at it with each other and it's,

6975
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:48,890
dude,

6976
03:05:48,890 --> 03:05:51,450
it sounded like there was little demons
in there trying to kill each other.

6977
03:05:51,530 --> 03:05:53,700
Then what did you guys just go
in there and mark among this?

6978
03:05:53,730 --> 03:05:54,563
They're just,

6979
03:05:54,600 --> 03:05:55,433
they're about to throw down.

6980
03:05:55,440 --> 03:05:56,710
Look at this like this.

6981
03:05:56,840 --> 03:05:57,810
It put their hands up.

6982
03:05:58,080 --> 03:05:58,913
What is going on?

6983
03:05:59,220 --> 03:06:00,290
Why are they all flat?

6984
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:01,890
Korean Zombie just
looked up at the screen.

6985
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:02,130
Yeah.

6986
03:06:02,130 --> 03:06:03,900
He said let's meet right in
the center and throw it out.

6987
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:05,760
I think that's bombies down.

6988
03:06:06,780 --> 03:06:07,920
I don't know what happened there.

6989
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:10,260
Zombie looked around like
we're talking about wild pigs.

6990
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:13,930
People like this fucking fight is
amazing and these two assholes,

6991
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:15,430
you a bunch of people to clap and shit.

6992
03:06:16,530 --> 03:06:17,390
Chocolate bodies,

6993
03:06:17,580 --> 03:06:18,450
chocolate face,

6994
03:06:19,070 --> 03:06:19,903
chocolate,

6995
03:06:20,380 --> 03:06:21,630
chocolate body's totally okay.

6996
03:06:21,900 --> 03:06:23,850
So when you go upstairs
with the face you're,

6997
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:27,430
you're better off going full
white face chocolate body and say,

6998
03:06:27,431 --> 03:06:27,721
hey man,

6999
03:06:27,721 --> 03:06:29,660
I'll never do black faces disrespectful,

7000
03:06:29,810 --> 03:06:33,330
but you have chocolate feet
straight left hand by the Zombie.

7001
03:06:33,331 --> 03:06:34,440
That was nice.

7002
03:06:34,610 --> 03:06:37,320
Zombies trying to get
in the fucking shootout.

7003
03:06:37,350 --> 03:06:39,000
That was a serious straight left.

7004
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:42,960
He's been switching stances and as he
switches stances he pops out left hand in

7005
03:06:42,961 --> 03:06:43,794
there.

7006
03:06:43,900 --> 03:06:44,210
God,

7007
03:06:44,210 --> 03:06:45,030
if someone said,

7008
03:06:45,030 --> 03:06:45,581
hey shop,

7009
03:06:45,581 --> 03:06:48,900
I'll give you $100,000 tell
me he's winning this fight.

7010
03:06:48,900 --> 03:06:49,471
I couldn't do it.

7011
03:06:49,471 --> 03:06:50,304
I'm not sure.

7012
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:54,300
I'll tell you about the couple of
things about chocolate bodies and blogs.

7013
03:06:54,960 --> 03:06:56,310
I know quite a bit about that.

7014
03:06:56,610 --> 03:06:57,443
Let me to,

7015
03:06:57,540 --> 03:06:58,700
nothing in a wild pigs.

7016
03:06:58,760 --> 03:06:59,510
I know.

7017
03:06:59,510 --> 03:07:00,930
It's been an entertaining fight.

7018
03:07:01,790 --> 03:07:02,623
Yeah.

7019
03:07:02,730 --> 03:07:03,570
Oh,

7020
03:07:03,571 --> 03:07:04,021
beautiful.

7021
03:07:04,021 --> 03:07:05,100
Spinning back fist.

7022
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:05,790
Yeah.

7023
03:07:05,790 --> 03:07:06,970
Here they still,

7024
03:07:06,980 --> 03:07:08,430
we that tries to hammer fist.

7025
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:10,050
He's still super creative.

7026
03:07:10,051 --> 03:07:11,460
Oh yeah.

7027
03:07:11,461 --> 03:07:12,900
He's a fun guy to watch,

7028
03:07:12,901 --> 03:07:13,560
man.

7029
03:07:13,560 --> 03:07:13,891
I really,

7030
03:07:13,891 --> 03:07:14,724
yes.

7031
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:15,301
Oh,

7032
03:07:15,301 --> 03:07:15,571
nice.

7033
03:07:15,571 --> 03:07:16,404
Right.

7034
03:07:17,020 --> 03:07:17,531
We'll shortly,

7035
03:07:17,531 --> 03:07:18,141
we'll check.

7036
03:07:18,141 --> 03:07:18,974
Hook

7037
03:07:20,330 --> 03:07:21,480
that side kick to the knee.

7038
03:07:21,481 --> 03:07:21,721
Man.

7039
03:07:21,721 --> 03:07:23,070
That's such a nasty move.

7040
03:07:23,130 --> 03:07:23,310
Yeah.

7041
03:07:23,310 --> 03:07:24,900
Here was that Jackson's for a little bit,

7042
03:07:24,901 --> 03:07:25,410
remember?

7043
03:07:25,410 --> 03:07:25,800
Yup.

7044
03:07:25,800 --> 03:07:27,270
The sidekick is their thing.

7045
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:28,553
Well,

7046
03:07:29,490 --> 03:07:30,420
it's a legit move.

7047
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:30,931
Fuck.

7048
03:07:30,931 --> 03:07:31,480
Yeah.

7049
03:07:31,480 --> 03:07:32,251
That was just good.

7050
03:07:32,251 --> 03:07:32,791
Whitaker.

7051
03:07:32,791 --> 03:07:33,690
Yoel Romero.

7052
03:07:34,650 --> 03:07:35,483
Yeah.

7053
03:07:35,970 --> 03:07:36,211
Dude.

7054
03:07:36,211 --> 03:07:39,050
How about fucking Weidman can start crazy.

7055
03:07:39,051 --> 03:07:40,140
Can you get the next title shot?

7056
03:07:40,141 --> 03:07:41,460
Two cranes and,

7057
03:07:41,610 --> 03:07:41,761
well,

7058
03:07:41,761 --> 03:07:43,080
I guess Aaker ray gets it now.

7059
03:07:43,550 --> 03:07:44,383
[inaudible]

7060
03:07:44,970 --> 03:07:46,890
style bender with Chuck Gray for,

7061
03:07:47,340 --> 03:07:48,030
because Jacqui,

7062
03:07:48,030 --> 03:07:49,110
I already lost her Whitaker.

7063
03:07:49,230 --> 03:07:50,063
Yeah,

7064
03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:51,210
no one wants to see that.

7065
03:07:51,300 --> 03:07:51,571
Yeah,

7066
03:07:51,571 --> 03:07:52,470
but man,

7067
03:07:52,471 --> 03:07:52,681
I mean,

7068
03:07:52,681 --> 03:07:54,930
how many more years do you think
geography is going to fight?

7069
03:07:54,931 --> 03:07:56,400
He's 38 and I met,

7070
03:07:56,401 --> 03:07:59,280
he beat the guy who was
going to get the title shot,

7071
03:08:00,300 --> 03:08:01,133
don't you think?

7072
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:01,730
Yeah.

7073
03:08:01,730 --> 03:08:01,921
Well,

7074
03:08:01,921 --> 03:08:02,250
no.

7075
03:08:02,250 --> 03:08:03,150
Weidman was for sure.

7076
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:06,330
They were going to fly him to
the fight to be a alternate.

7077
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:07,343
But here's the thing,

7078
03:08:07,360 --> 03:08:08,610
to keep putting their hands up.

7079
03:08:08,611 --> 03:08:10,080
There's fucking left.

7080
03:08:10,110 --> 03:08:10,860
I don't understand.

7081
03:08:10,860 --> 03:08:11,221
Tell you what,

7082
03:08:11,221 --> 03:08:11,760
if there's,

7083
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:12,480
what are they doing?

7084
03:08:12,480 --> 03:08:13,313
I don't understand.

7085
03:08:13,380 --> 03:08:13,680
I too,

7086
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:14,940
if you don't want to get the bonus,

7087
03:08:14,941 --> 03:08:16,320
do this kick to the body there.

7088
03:08:16,520 --> 03:08:17,061
Oh,

7089
03:08:17,061 --> 03:08:17,870
Yolo.

7090
03:08:17,870 --> 03:08:18,530
Shift.

7091
03:08:18,530 --> 03:08:19,180
Flatline.

7092
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:20,013
Holy.

7093
03:08:21,380 --> 03:08:24,770
Holy got seconds left.

7094
03:08:24,890 --> 03:08:25,170
Oh,

7095
03:08:25,170 --> 03:08:26,003
my

7096
03:08:26,960 --> 03:08:28,610
elbow knocked Korean Zombie.

7097
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:29,900
Oh my God.

7098
03:08:29,901 --> 03:08:31,880
That was in sick and
kick all the coaches out.

7099
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:37,570
Celebrate the data here is insane.

7100
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:38,530
Flatlined dumb.

7101
03:08:38,590 --> 03:08:39,920
Oh my God.

7102
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:40,773
He's Zombie dumb.

7103
03:08:41,470 --> 03:08:46,470
He's still out looking at
the doctor over a dire.

7104
03:08:47,180 --> 03:08:48,050
Calling the doctor over.

7105
03:08:48,130 --> 03:08:48,700
Yeah,

7106
03:08:48,700 --> 03:08:50,230
probably knows dude.

7107
03:08:50,231 --> 03:08:52,270
That fucking elbow flat.

7108
03:08:52,440 --> 03:08:53,290
We had a replay.

7109
03:08:54,670 --> 03:08:55,180
Jesus.

7110
03:08:55,180 --> 03:08:55,331
Oh,

7111
03:08:55,331 --> 03:08:55,931
he's hurt,

7112
03:08:55,931 --> 03:08:56,764
man.

7113
03:08:57,030 --> 03:08:57,940
Is that he was hurt.

7114
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:01,820
See how he got up and
he just Winston pain.

7115
03:09:03,880 --> 03:09:04,181
What do you,

7116
03:09:04,181 --> 03:09:05,014
what did he hurt?

7117
03:09:05,940 --> 03:09:07,440
Just coach cow.

7118
03:09:07,510 --> 03:09:08,343
Here we go.

7119
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:10,710
This is one of the best Naca.

7120
03:09:10,711 --> 03:09:11,860
Was that on the Buzzer?

7121
03:09:11,890 --> 03:09:12,461
Yes.

7122
03:09:12,461 --> 03:09:13,294
Look at this.

7123
03:09:13,590 --> 03:09:13,880
Yeah.

7124
03:09:13,880 --> 03:09:14,713
Whoops.

7125
03:09:14,890 --> 03:09:15,910
Oh,

7126
03:09:15,920 --> 03:09:16,910
boring elbow.

7127
03:09:16,970 --> 03:09:17,870
Insane.

7128
03:09:17,871 --> 03:09:18,930
Holy Fall.

7129
03:09:18,980 --> 03:09:19,221
My,

7130
03:09:19,221 --> 03:09:20,660
I've never seen a suite like it.

7131
03:09:20,661 --> 03:09:21,494
Never ever seen that.

7132
03:09:22,130 --> 03:09:23,840
Oh my God.

7133
03:09:24,380 --> 03:09:25,580
Oh my goodness.

7134
03:09:25,610 --> 03:09:29,840
What a fucking K on a
beautiful elbow credit.

7135
03:09:29,930 --> 03:09:31,130
Oh my God.

7136
03:09:31,610 --> 03:09:32,960
Oh my God,

7137
03:09:33,230 --> 03:09:33,710
dude,

7138
03:09:33,710 --> 03:09:34,400
that was,

7139
03:09:34,400 --> 03:09:36,620
can we get the cliquiness
clock at the bottom?

7140
03:09:37,220 --> 03:09:37,521
Oh,

7141
03:09:37,521 --> 03:09:38,354
Mike,

7142
03:09:38,830 --> 03:09:39,663
two seconds.

7143
03:09:39,950 --> 03:09:41,640
Two seconds.

7144
03:09:41,960 --> 03:09:43,320
And I wonder what the scorecard we're,

7145
03:09:43,380 --> 03:09:44,400
we're going into that.

7146
03:09:44,401 --> 03:09:45,420
That's a good question.

7147
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:48,630
I wish we were paying attention
and we watched the Kale.

7148
03:09:50,340 --> 03:09:51,151
That's phenomenal,

7149
03:09:51,151 --> 03:09:51,984
man.

7150
03:09:52,410 --> 03:09:53,590
That is phenomenal.

7151
03:09:53,920 --> 03:09:54,131
Look,

7152
03:09:54,131 --> 03:09:57,760
it isn't a man Victor Ortiz to Holy Shit.

7153
03:09:57,761 --> 03:09:59,550
What a big win for [inaudible].

7154
03:10:01,080 --> 03:10:01,913
Victor Davala,

7155
03:10:01,930 --> 03:10:02,770
the guy who just jumped in,

7156
03:10:02,771 --> 03:10:03,221
use the,

7157
03:10:03,221 --> 03:10:03,370
uh,

7158
03:10:03,370 --> 03:10:06,010
he's a UFC commentator for the Cortez.

7159
03:10:06,190 --> 03:10:07,023
Yeah.

7160
03:10:07,390 --> 03:10:08,170
Super good dude.

7161
03:10:08,170 --> 03:10:08,730
That's my nails.

7162
03:10:08,730 --> 03:10:09,563
Black belts too.

7163
03:10:09,720 --> 03:10:09,941
Yeah.

7164
03:10:09,941 --> 03:10:10,774
He's a great guy.

7165
03:10:10,990 --> 03:10:13,000
Him and a ver doom or the deport days,

7166
03:10:13,001 --> 03:10:13,241
guys.

7167
03:10:13,241 --> 03:10:13,430
Dude,

7168
03:10:13,430 --> 03:10:15,590
that right elbow was so nasty.

7169
03:10:15,630 --> 03:10:16,510
I've never seen that.

7170
03:10:16,750 --> 03:10:17,583
I've never,

7171
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:21,100
ever shot the shot.

7172
03:10:22,090 --> 03:10:23,680
Wow.

7173
03:10:23,800 --> 03:10:25,150
That is crazy.

7174
03:10:25,570 --> 03:10:25,980
That was a,

7175
03:10:25,980 --> 03:10:27,900
that was one of the craziest
elbows you're ever going to see,

7176
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:28,560
man.

7177
03:10:28,560 --> 03:10:29,410
Best out of the year,

7178
03:10:30,300 --> 03:10:32,230
especially considering that
he's got this nickname,

7179
03:10:32,231 --> 03:10:33,520
the Korean Zombie,

7180
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:34,600
and we've never seen the,

7181
03:10:34,610 --> 03:10:35,020
wait a minute,

7182
03:10:35,020 --> 03:10:35,411
wait a minute.

7183
03:10:35,411 --> 03:10:37,990
Was Alster and Francis was that this year?

7184
03:10:39,340 --> 03:10:40,173
We're always,

7185
03:10:40,400 --> 03:10:41,580
was that this year?

7186
03:10:43,700 --> 03:10:44,680
I think this is better.

7187
03:10:44,710 --> 03:10:49,570
I've seen how many bright hands connect
that was left fuckings left hook by the

7188
03:10:49,571 --> 03:10:50,290
way.

7189
03:10:50,290 --> 03:10:51,160
Left right hook.

7190
03:10:51,161 --> 03:10:52,900
Technically at the end of
last year was December.

7191
03:10:52,960 --> 03:10:53,081
No,

7192
03:10:53,081 --> 03:10:54,760
that was the upper cut he had last year.

7193
03:10:55,090 --> 03:10:55,630
Last year.

7194
03:10:55,630 --> 03:10:56,141
So last year.

7195
03:10:56,141 --> 03:10:57,340
So we got this out.

7196
03:10:57,730 --> 03:10:58,563
It's out of the running.

7197
03:10:58,900 --> 03:11:00,130
That's the number one.

7198
03:11:00,170 --> 03:11:00,430
The,

7199
03:11:00,430 --> 03:11:00,730
yeah.

7200
03:11:00,730 --> 03:11:01,241
Okay.

7201
03:11:01,241 --> 03:11:03,860
But Albo from no look fucking right.

7202
03:11:04,060 --> 03:11:04,893
But that's,

7203
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:07,000
but that's only you have seen.

7204
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:09,030
Yeah.

7205
03:11:09,030 --> 03:11:09,980
Other ones don't really count,

7206
03:11:09,981 --> 03:11:10,221
does it?

7207
03:11:10,221 --> 03:11:11,860
Or they should.

7208
03:11:12,120 --> 03:11:12,420
Well,

7209
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:12,940
okay.

7210
03:11:12,940 --> 03:11:13,830
Valid tour

7211
03:11:15,400 --> 03:11:15,860
for sure.

7212
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:16,990
Belterra has some good ones.

7213
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:17,920
Okay.

7214
03:11:17,920 --> 03:11:19,350
What's the best scale?

7215
03:11:19,510 --> 03:11:20,160
Yes.

7216
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:21,130
Pico Santam.

7217
03:11:21,131 --> 03:11:21,770
Great Kale.

7218
03:11:21,770 --> 03:11:23,650
It goes upper cut that
we talked about earlier.

7219
03:11:24,030 --> 03:11:25,240
That upper cuts insane.

7220
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:28,330
I'll flip through here to here
is the best chaos of the year.

7221
03:11:28,990 --> 03:11:29,823
Cater.

7222
03:11:30,060 --> 03:11:30,830
Yeah.

7223
03:11:30,830 --> 03:11:31,720
Kid had had a good one.

7224
03:11:31,721 --> 03:11:32,800
I was at that fight.

7225
03:11:33,490 --> 03:11:37,150
John Gray Brunson jocker
rate head kicked him.

7226
03:11:37,151 --> 03:11:38,170
That's what's so crazy.

7227
03:11:38,171 --> 03:11:38,801
Shock race.

7228
03:11:38,801 --> 03:11:39,420
Just right here.

7229
03:11:39,420 --> 03:11:40,600
Fucking dudes up.

7230
03:11:40,920 --> 03:11:41,330
No,

7231
03:11:41,330 --> 03:11:41,680
that's,

7232
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:43,190
that's not even the same fucking no,

7233
03:11:43,191 --> 03:11:43,341
no,

7234
03:11:43,341 --> 03:11:43,481
no.

7235
03:11:43,481 --> 03:11:44,350
It's a different thing.

7236
03:11:44,950 --> 03:11:45,221
Oh,

7237
03:11:45,221 --> 03:11:46,240
fucking Smith.

7238
03:11:48,010 --> 03:11:49,510
This is t Santos.

7239
03:11:50,320 --> 03:11:51,690
Santos code him though.

7240
03:11:51,790 --> 03:11:54,580
But he shot he body shot at
him and then beat him down.

7241
03:11:54,810 --> 03:11:58,410
I've never seen a no look
elbow knocking dude out fall.

7242
03:11:59,110 --> 03:11:59,800
Um,

7243
03:11:59,800 --> 03:12:02,740
if you ever seen Oh yeah.

7244
03:12:02,741 --> 03:12:04,110
Meryl rock cold was getting Oh,

7245
03:12:04,130 --> 03:12:05,320
Rockhold is fantastic.

7246
03:12:05,330 --> 03:12:05,421
Yeah,

7247
03:12:05,421 --> 03:12:06,400
it was fucked up.

7248
03:12:06,401 --> 03:12:07,250
You Ain't getting that as a beat.

7249
03:12:07,251 --> 03:12:07,461
Yeah.

7250
03:12:07,461 --> 03:12:09,220
Your fight for some quite some time.

7251
03:12:09,460 --> 03:12:09,791
No,

7252
03:12:09,791 --> 03:12:10,031
no,

7253
03:12:10,031 --> 03:12:10,540
no.

7254
03:12:10,540 --> 03:12:11,470
He got fucked up dude.

7255
03:12:11,470 --> 03:12:14,840
He is really stand on his leg tube.

7256
03:12:14,841 --> 03:12:16,210
When Gol Punches you,

7257
03:12:16,240 --> 03:12:17,800
it just seems like a different thing.

7258
03:12:18,760 --> 03:12:21,130
The way he punched Rockhold
and then punched him again.

7259
03:12:21,131 --> 03:12:22,300
It's like a different thing.

7260
03:12:22,390 --> 03:12:25,560
Did you forget 85 there's
some great fucking fire still.

7261
03:12:25,690 --> 03:12:27,190
It might be the best division right now.

7262
03:12:28,540 --> 03:12:29,860
55 stack.

7263
03:12:29,890 --> 03:12:32,570
It is seventies fucking football stats.

7264
03:12:32,571 --> 03:12:33,850
The but you know what?

7265
03:12:34,030 --> 03:12:39,030
Between Style Bender Bora Cina you know
you got Yoel Romero who's still in the

7266
03:12:40,451 --> 03:12:41,284
mix.

7267
03:12:41,300 --> 03:12:42,450
Why Robert Whittaker?

7268
03:12:42,660 --> 03:12:45,700
Cold Weidman was in that fight.

7269
03:12:45,730 --> 03:12:48,070
I know it was good until the last punch.

7270
03:12:48,190 --> 03:12:49,870
The jock or array land to the k Odom.

7271
03:12:49,960 --> 03:12:52,400
Kelvin Gas Slum Kelvin gasoline there.

7272
03:12:52,401 --> 03:12:53,960
Stack rock holds a beast,

7273
03:12:53,961 --> 03:12:54,794
man.

7274
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:56,233
Who else?

7275
03:12:56,360 --> 03:12:58,640
85 is up there.

7276
03:12:58,880 --> 03:12:59,930
How about cannoneer?

7277
03:13:00,170 --> 03:13:03,440
Who just fought at 85 looked
like offset first big Wister,

7278
03:13:03,920 --> 03:13:04,131
dude,

7279
03:13:04,131 --> 03:13:05,360
he looks terrified.

7280
03:13:05,390 --> 03:13:06,170
Here it is again.

7281
03:13:06,170 --> 03:13:07,070
Oh my goodness.

7282
03:13:07,100 --> 03:13:08,090
That is pretty Dick.

7283
03:13:08,110 --> 03:13:08,410
Yes.

7284
03:13:08,410 --> 03:13:09,470
Look at this slide.

7285
03:13:09,471 --> 03:13:09,951
Slide.

7286
03:13:09,951 --> 03:13:12,620
Slide Bank.

7287
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:13,580
Ooh.

7288
03:13:13,670 --> 03:13:17,450
I mean there's that Lacy
Day is this is placement.

7289
03:13:17,480 --> 03:13:18,201
So perfect.

7290
03:13:18,201 --> 03:13:19,250
What's he saying about his leg?

7291
03:13:25,920 --> 03:13:29,350
He does camp in Cowboy Cerrone
cause they did their camp.

7292
03:13:29,420 --> 03:13:30,253
Yeah.

7293
03:13:30,650 --> 03:13:31,483
That's beautiful.

7294
03:13:33,550 --> 03:13:34,031
They just,

7295
03:13:34,031 --> 03:13:34,864
uh,

7296
03:13:38,090 --> 03:13:38,420
he,

7297
03:13:38,420 --> 03:13:40,180
I wonder what happened
to him and he's limping.

7298
03:13:40,390 --> 03:13:40,541
Oh,

7299
03:13:40,541 --> 03:13:41,374
he's bringing it up now

7300
03:13:44,080 --> 03:13:44,950
to break his feet

7301
03:13:47,310 --> 03:13:47,811
first round.

7302
03:13:47,811 --> 03:13:48,601
He fucked his foot up,

7303
03:13:48,601 --> 03:13:49,434
you said.

7304
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:50,383
Okay.

7305
03:13:54,750 --> 03:13:57,360
So he kicked his knee accidentally.

7306
03:13:57,800 --> 03:14:01,920
He thinks he broke his foot in the first
round or at least fucked his foot up in

7307
03:14:01,921 --> 03:14:02,754
the first round.

7308
03:14:04,530 --> 03:14:05,220
Wow.

7309
03:14:05,220 --> 03:14:06,450
Does he call it the beat now?

7310
03:14:08,050 --> 03:14:08,883
Yeah.

7311
03:14:10,380 --> 03:14:13,140
Whoever's Sean Shelby and
Dana White want me to fight?

7312
03:14:13,770 --> 03:14:17,520
Always a standard thing to say that you
never get picked phase when you do that,

7313
03:14:17,521 --> 03:14:18,120
but yeah.

7314
03:14:18,120 --> 03:14:18,900
Yeah.

7315
03:14:18,900 --> 03:14:22,050
You always get to just go for
someone even it's not your nature.

7316
03:14:22,890 --> 03:14:23,723
Yeah.

7317
03:14:25,140 --> 03:14:25,890
Yeah.

7318
03:14:25,890 --> 03:14:27,150
If you really want that fight,

7319
03:14:27,151 --> 03:14:29,640
you got to ask for data and
they put it in their brain.

7320
03:14:29,641 --> 03:14:31,860
Otherwise they can give
you what they think's best.

7321
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:37,050
Very interesting fight though for what
we did get to see of it and that elbow

7322
03:14:37,051 --> 03:14:38,400
was fucking fantastic.

7323
03:14:38,430 --> 03:14:39,021
That's not going to,

7324
03:14:39,021 --> 03:14:39,330
yeah,

7325
03:14:39,330 --> 03:14:40,890
that's such a really good,

7326
03:14:40,891 --> 03:14:45,891
important point about the
difference between recklessly
charging in and you know

7327
03:14:47,360 --> 03:14:50,730
what the Korean zombies doing that turning
into a Zombie war like he does every

7328
03:14:50,731 --> 03:14:51,200
fight.

7329
03:14:51,200 --> 03:14:52,560
It was a work and I feel as,

7330
03:14:52,561 --> 03:14:55,420
I feel like you'd probably be up on the
scorecards look like it was working and

7331
03:14:55,430 --> 03:14:57,450
then now we'll find out.

7332
03:14:57,780 --> 03:14:58,780
We'll find out later what,

7333
03:14:58,781 --> 03:15:02,280
what the people that were watching
think even at the scorecards,

7334
03:15:02,310 --> 03:15:05,430
one person I've read said he was down
three one going into that round for the

7335
03:15:05,431 --> 03:15:10,180
Zombie three rounds to one Zombie was
up from what I saw does not mean the

7336
03:15:10,230 --> 03:15:11,580
exchanges looked like it.

7337
03:15:11,610 --> 03:15:13,770
He was definitely coming
after him moving forward,

7338
03:15:13,771 --> 03:15:16,740
but it looks like GI or was getting
some shots and happy then good for him,

7339
03:15:16,741 --> 03:15:17,310
man.

7340
03:15:17,310 --> 03:15:18,480
Look if you take the drama too,

7341
03:15:18,481 --> 03:15:21,110
there's this family got blood on your mom.

7342
03:15:21,900 --> 03:15:22,770
Do we have this again?

7343
03:15:23,370 --> 03:15:24,330
This is so sick,

7344
03:15:24,640 --> 03:15:25,640
dude.

7345
03:15:26,460 --> 03:15:28,310
That's m n one shit.

7346
03:15:28,410 --> 03:15:29,190
Ooh,

7347
03:15:29,190 --> 03:15:30,870
he just delivered that.

7348
03:15:30,871 --> 03:15:31,704
Look at this.

7349
03:15:33,520 --> 03:15:34,510
That's radiate.

7350
03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:35,520
Oh my God.

7351
03:15:35,970 --> 03:15:40,970
One of the best elbow chaos of all AV
or of all times of all time and perfect

7352
03:15:41,881 --> 03:15:42,960
time to use that technique.

7353
03:15:42,961 --> 03:15:46,380
And that's the number 10 guy in
the world and in the Korean Zombie,

7354
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:46,831
you know,

7355
03:15:46,831 --> 03:15:47,140
he's a,

7356
03:15:47,140 --> 03:15:50,700
it's a fight where according to
at least one judge he was losing.

7357
03:15:51,420 --> 03:15:52,330
That's insane.

7358
03:15:52,331 --> 03:15:54,730
And he lands that and it's
just not how the coach,

7359
03:15:54,820 --> 03:15:59,100
the bottom line in and it uses
the momentum of his attacker.

7360
03:15:59,130 --> 03:16:03,700
Like it's a beautiful lesson in martial
arts for people to watch like a,

7361
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:06,600
when a strike like that lands
and it lands so perfectly,

7362
03:16:06,690 --> 03:16:09,390
that opens up that strike
for a lot of people.

7363
03:16:09,430 --> 03:16:10,590
100% right.

7364
03:16:10,650 --> 03:16:13,800
You remember John Jones started the one
where he touched inside leg and did the

7365
03:16:13,810 --> 03:16:15,620
spending and then
everyone started to do it.

7366
03:16:15,990 --> 03:16:16,530
Yeah,

7367
03:16:16,530 --> 03:16:16,861
no,

7368
03:16:16,861 --> 03:16:18,070
John One guy does it.

7369
03:16:18,840 --> 03:16:19,673
Yeah.

7370
03:16:19,720 --> 03:16:23,190
Did you ever see a gas Tom
Bolano spinning elbow and Beltre.

7371
03:16:23,730 --> 03:16:26,580
No Sun dope son.

7372
03:16:26,630 --> 03:16:27,463
Really?

7373
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:30,450
You want to see someone look like
they got shot with a laser beam?

7374
03:16:30,810 --> 03:16:32,790
Moon really just hits me the head.

7375
03:16:32,970 --> 03:16:33,803
That shit.

7376
03:16:34,230 --> 03:16:37,170
This dude got hit so hard gas.

7377
03:16:37,260 --> 03:16:38,041
Dawn is a,

7378
03:16:38,041 --> 03:16:40,260
you know he's a real
worldclass Moy Thai fighter.

7379
03:16:40,261 --> 03:16:41,094
Look left.

7380
03:16:41,220 --> 03:16:44,220
Oh fuck dude.

7381
03:16:45,780 --> 03:16:46,860
Watch this one more time.

7382
03:16:46,861 --> 03:16:47,694
Watch this.

7383
03:16:48,180 --> 03:16:49,800
Oh my God.

7384
03:16:49,801 --> 03:16:51,660
Come on site of them.

7385
03:16:51,661 --> 03:16:53,400
But it's the way it lands too.

7386
03:16:53,401 --> 03:16:54,840
It's just so perfect.

7387
03:16:55,140 --> 03:16:56,190
Ooh.

7388
03:16:56,340 --> 03:16:59,280
Now was this against the
number 10 fight in the world?

7389
03:16:59,310 --> 03:16:59,860
No.

7390
03:16:59,860 --> 03:17:00,990
So yeah,

7391
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:02,460
years is more impressive,

7392
03:17:02,550 --> 03:17:04,120
but boom.

7393
03:17:04,590 --> 03:17:06,030
I've seen spinning elbows.

7394
03:17:06,031 --> 03:17:07,080
Land knocked it down.

7395
03:17:07,890 --> 03:17:08,860
That one's pretty cool.

7396
03:17:09,220 --> 03:17:10,110
Let's watch it one more time.

7397
03:17:10,370 --> 03:17:10,770
Time.

7398
03:17:10,770 --> 03:17:11,640
Never seen a guy.

7399
03:17:11,641 --> 03:17:12,061
No,

7400
03:17:12,061 --> 03:17:12,451
look.

7401
03:17:12,451 --> 03:17:13,590
Kao some with an l,

7402
03:17:13,591 --> 03:17:15,150
but I don't think I have
either watched it though.

7403
03:17:16,290 --> 03:17:17,100
That's real time.

7404
03:17:17,100 --> 03:17:17,551
One more time.

7405
03:17:17,551 --> 03:17:17,970
Real time.

7406
03:17:17,970 --> 03:17:18,340
One more time.

7407
03:17:18,340 --> 03:17:18,691
More time.

7408
03:17:18,691 --> 03:17:19,231
Real time.

7409
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:20,064
Real time.

7410
03:17:20,100 --> 03:17:21,090
Give it to you in real time.

7411
03:17:22,430 --> 03:17:24,700
Look at this song that,

7412
03:17:24,701 --> 03:17:25,440
I mean,

7413
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:26,490
that is insane.

7414
03:17:26,520 --> 03:17:27,353
That's like,

7415
03:17:27,900 --> 03:17:29,250
that's the restart.

7416
03:17:29,251 --> 03:17:29,881
That's control.

7417
03:17:29,881 --> 03:17:30,120
Alt,

7418
03:17:30,120 --> 03:17:30,953
delete.

7419
03:17:31,320 --> 03:17:34,170
Right to the whole thing
goes dark and comes back up.

7420
03:17:34,410 --> 03:17:34,651
Yeah.

7421
03:17:34,651 --> 03:17:39,240
But Korean Zombie is a guy who
first of all was deep in that fight.

7422
03:17:39,241 --> 03:17:40,500
Maybe even winning that fight,

7423
03:17:40,501 --> 03:17:45,501
at least according to one judge known for
being a Zombie known for being able to

7424
03:17:45,751 --> 03:17:46,920
take a tremendous shot,

7425
03:17:46,980 --> 03:17:47,610
flatline,

7426
03:17:47,610 --> 03:17:48,630
toughest shit.

7427
03:17:49,140 --> 03:17:51,420
Flatlined flatline and fight.

7428
03:17:51,421 --> 03:17:53,370
He might've been winning and powerful.

7429
03:17:53,490 --> 03:17:54,241
Rashad here,

7430
03:17:54,241 --> 03:17:55,020
shod looking,

7431
03:17:55,020 --> 03:17:56,370
suave.

7432
03:17:56,520 --> 03:17:57,730
I like your shape to everything.

7433
03:17:57,800 --> 03:17:58,440
Whatever.

7434
03:17:58,440 --> 03:17:58,951
I like that.

7435
03:17:58,951 --> 03:17:59,910
What he's doing his hair.

7436
03:17:59,911 --> 03:18:02,730
I liked this purple
psychedelic Paisley tie.

7437
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:03,660
Not Mad at the beard.

7438
03:18:04,140 --> 03:18:05,160
I liked the whole look.

7439
03:18:06,330 --> 03:18:07,163
Jimmy Smith.

7440
03:18:08,520 --> 03:18:09,330
What's that pin?

7441
03:18:09,330 --> 03:18:12,090
We think that Penn is so Porsche
pen and I just went to Dick.

7442
03:18:12,090 --> 03:18:12,361
You'd be,

7443
03:18:12,361 --> 03:18:13,650
if you had like a Ferrari pin.

7444
03:18:13,680 --> 03:18:14,550
That's some shit I would do.

7445
03:18:15,800 --> 03:18:18,360
I what do you think that Penn is?

7446
03:18:18,420 --> 03:18:19,080
I don't know.

7447
03:18:19,080 --> 03:18:20,280
It looks like your pores that pin.

7448
03:18:20,281 --> 03:18:21,114
Jimmy,

7449
03:18:21,840 --> 03:18:22,530
what do you think?

7450
03:18:22,530 --> 03:18:23,970
It's probably for veterans today.

7451
03:18:24,120 --> 03:18:25,950
Oh,

7452
03:18:26,010 --> 03:18:26,843
good call.

7453
03:18:27,560 --> 03:18:28,393
Yeah,

7454
03:18:28,570 --> 03:18:30,390
keep call doing something
along those lines.

7455
03:18:30,780 --> 03:18:31,613
Um,

7456
03:18:32,490 --> 03:18:33,323
well dude,

7457
03:18:33,390 --> 03:18:34,710
well we covered it all bro.

7458
03:18:35,790 --> 03:18:40,790
We could cover it all but fighting
for all you bodybuilders out there.

7459
03:18:41,130 --> 03:18:41,910
We don't really care.

7460
03:18:41,910 --> 03:18:42,091
No,

7461
03:18:42,091 --> 03:18:42,570
keep doing it.

7462
03:18:42,570 --> 03:18:43,310
Chocolate bodies.

7463
03:18:43,310 --> 03:18:46,830
We actually don't judge it because it's
hilarious and it makes you look better.

7464
03:18:46,890 --> 03:18:47,723
You're right dude.

7465
03:18:47,770 --> 03:18:48,730
It's an advantage.

7466
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:49,840
Chalk it up bro.

7467
03:18:49,870 --> 03:18:50,081
Yeah,

7468
03:18:50,081 --> 03:18:50,710
you're right.

7469
03:18:50,710 --> 03:18:51,280
I get it.

7470
03:18:51,280 --> 03:18:51,650
I get,

7471
03:18:51,650 --> 03:18:53,500
I don't think that you
shouldn't be able to do it,

7472
03:18:53,770 --> 03:18:55,570
but I do think all of it's crazy.

7473
03:18:57,690 --> 03:18:58,570
Now I look at it more.

7474
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:00,580
I don't even think it's racist.

7475
03:19:00,850 --> 03:19:02,170
I don't even think it's racist.

7476
03:19:02,560 --> 03:19:06,050
I think they're just trying to
look like they're like a black guy.

7477
03:19:06,051 --> 03:19:07,630
Shredded like a black guy,

7478
03:19:07,940 --> 03:19:08,590
Dario.

7479
03:19:08,590 --> 03:19:09,910
That's exactly what they're doing.

7480
03:19:09,940 --> 03:19:10,720
And listen,

7481
03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:11,710
it's working for him.

7482
03:19:11,711 --> 03:19:14,770
And John Libby's the new
thing highlights credible.

7483
03:19:15,430 --> 03:19:16,900
Well definitely has an impact man.

7484
03:19:16,901 --> 03:19:21,100
I mean if you're white like paper and
try and look jacked on TV and you're

7485
03:19:21,101 --> 03:19:23,800
standing next to a duty when
chocolate face and chocolate Bonnie,

7486
03:19:24,070 --> 03:19:25,270
that guy's going to look way darker.

7487
03:19:25,271 --> 03:19:26,280
Who wants to be more chocolate?

7488
03:19:26,281 --> 03:19:29,470
And the only reason why you should go
chocolate face is because otherwise it's

7489
03:19:29,471 --> 03:19:30,700
super distracting.

7490
03:19:31,930 --> 03:19:34,360
Cause now you've got to go all
now I don't think you're Tan.

7491
03:19:34,361 --> 03:19:36,940
I think you're crazy what's going on.

7492
03:19:36,941 --> 03:19:40,510
But do you have like a
suit on like you know,

7493
03:19:40,511 --> 03:19:41,710
like a match it,

7494
03:19:41,740 --> 03:19:45,460
there's some girls who are particularly
sexually adventurous and they will,

7495
03:19:45,510 --> 03:19:45,760
uh,

7496
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:48,190
even for Halloween parties
we'll just paint their tits.

7497
03:19:48,220 --> 03:19:48,661
Yes.

7498
03:19:48,661 --> 03:19:50,230
That was the thing that
was going on for a while.

7499
03:19:50,260 --> 03:19:51,790
It was crazy like crazy.

7500
03:19:51,791 --> 03:19:52,520
It was like a loop.

7501
03:19:52,520 --> 03:19:53,353
Crazy hot,

7502
03:19:53,620 --> 03:19:54,310
crazy hot.

7503
03:19:54,310 --> 03:19:57,880
But it was like a loophole where girls
could basically be topless at parties

7504
03:19:57,881 --> 03:19:59,050
with paint on her tits.

7505
03:19:59,430 --> 03:20:00,880
You could see their full nipple,

7506
03:20:00,910 --> 03:20:03,100
but it was all heated stars over there.

7507
03:20:03,101 --> 03:20:07,510
Areolas are you watching twitch
these days while it's still going on?

7508
03:20:07,960 --> 03:20:08,500
What's twitch?

7509
03:20:08,500 --> 03:20:09,160
What's going on?

7510
03:20:09,160 --> 03:20:10,240
What's going on in twitch?

7511
03:20:10,270 --> 03:20:11,890
I don't know what day
they changed the rules,

7512
03:20:11,891 --> 03:20:13,540
but the rules got changed sometime.

7513
03:20:13,840 --> 03:20:14,890
Why they changed the rules?

7514
03:20:14,930 --> 03:20:15,340
No,

7515
03:20:15,340 --> 03:20:17,500
the other way to let
them paint their tits.

7516
03:20:17,740 --> 03:20:18,700
Why not listen?

7517
03:20:18,760 --> 03:20:23,760
If you can wear like some shear skin tight
shirt that shows your nipples and I'm

7518
03:20:23,921 --> 03:20:24,754
all for that.

7519
03:20:24,910 --> 03:20:27,460
Why can't a girl painter
tits and make some money?

7520
03:20:27,670 --> 03:20:30,760
What do you want to work at Denny's
motherfucker to guy pain his dick and make

7521
03:20:30,761 --> 03:20:31,420
some money?

7522
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:32,200
Yes.

7523
03:20:32,200 --> 03:20:32,650
Okay.

7524
03:20:32,650 --> 03:20:33,780
That's what I'm talking about.

7525
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:34,360
Perfect.

7526
03:20:34,360 --> 03:20:36,130
Too Hot.

7527
03:20:36,710 --> 03:20:38,820
This girl just has her
titties all done up scraping.

7528
03:20:38,830 --> 03:20:39,640
Only this one.

7529
03:20:39,640 --> 03:20:41,050
This is twitch world.

7530
03:20:41,080 --> 03:20:41,620
Yeah,

7531
03:20:41,620 --> 03:20:42,790
so they have fake Becu.

7532
03:20:43,180 --> 03:20:44,260
Get on Twitter.

7533
03:20:44,261 --> 03:20:45,094
It's just titties.

7534
03:20:45,190 --> 03:20:46,210
She has some tiny dude,

7535
03:20:46,211 --> 03:20:47,200
this is naked.

7536
03:20:47,890 --> 03:20:48,850
This girl's got no,

7537
03:20:48,880 --> 03:20:49,391
stop it.

7538
03:20:49,391 --> 03:20:50,224
You asshole.

7539
03:20:50,230 --> 03:20:50,810
The girls.

7540
03:20:50,810 --> 03:20:52,030
These girls separate them.

7541
03:20:52,170 --> 03:20:52,341
Oh,

7542
03:20:52,341 --> 03:20:53,420
but this is the LLC,

7543
03:20:53,450 --> 03:20:54,430
the dark web now.

7544
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:54,671
No,

7545
03:20:54,671 --> 03:20:54,731
no,

7546
03:20:54,731 --> 03:20:54,850
no.

7547
03:20:54,850 --> 03:20:55,540
We're good.

7548
03:20:55,540 --> 03:20:56,373
Leave it alone.

7549
03:20:57,100 --> 03:20:58,870
The point is they're allowed to do it.

7550
03:20:59,170 --> 03:21:00,700
She's got barbs through those nipples.

7551
03:21:00,760 --> 03:21:01,690
What's happening down there?

7552
03:21:01,770 --> 03:21:02,290
Hey man,

7553
03:21:02,290 --> 03:21:03,820
is there something happening
onto those nipples?

7554
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:05,140
Am I just looking at it right?

7555
03:21:05,141 --> 03:21:06,130
This is twitch.

7556
03:21:06,131 --> 03:21:07,400
What the fuck did they do it for?

7557
03:21:07,450 --> 03:21:08,740
What are those things on her nipples?

7558
03:21:08,770 --> 03:21:09,580
Are those,

7559
03:21:09,580 --> 03:21:10,660
is that some sort of a,

7560
03:21:10,680 --> 03:21:11,513
an object?

7561
03:21:12,240 --> 03:21:12,460
Yeah.

7562
03:21:12,460 --> 03:21:13,740
What does that sound like?

7563
03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:15,340
A nail through it.

7564
03:21:15,550 --> 03:21:15,690
Oh,

7565
03:21:15,690 --> 03:21:16,440
was that paint?

7566
03:21:16,440 --> 03:21:16,810
That's the way.

7567
03:21:16,810 --> 03:21:17,643
It's all pain.

7568
03:21:17,830 --> 03:21:21,410
I thought maybe she had some sort of
ring going on and I talk about twitch,

7569
03:21:21,430 --> 03:21:23,830
like my dad asking me
about CBD will ever know.

7570
03:21:23,920 --> 03:21:24,970
I have no clue.

7571
03:21:25,410 --> 03:21:27,220
I couldn't tell you what people do.

7572
03:21:27,221 --> 03:21:28,570
A lot of shows on twitch now.

7573
03:21:28,600 --> 03:21:29,890
I know a lot of,

7574
03:21:29,891 --> 03:21:30,550
uh,

7575
03:21:30,550 --> 03:21:32,410
you know who contacted me the other day,

7576
03:21:32,411 --> 03:21:33,640
Bubba the love sponge.

7577
03:21:33,690 --> 03:21:34,180
Oh really?

7578
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:34,391
Yeah.

7579
03:21:34,391 --> 03:21:35,680
He's doing a show on twitch.

7580
03:21:35,770 --> 03:21:36,940
He does a show on twitch.

7581
03:21:36,970 --> 03:21:37,601
Like a straight,

7582
03:21:37,601 --> 03:21:38,231
what do you mean show?

7583
03:21:38,231 --> 03:21:40,780
He was a famous a radio guy and still is.

7584
03:21:40,781 --> 03:21:41,200
I mean,

7585
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:41,521
did,

7586
03:21:41,521 --> 03:21:41,950
uh,

7587
03:21:41,950 --> 03:21:45,740
he used to be on Sirius in the early
days when Howard first got public.

7588
03:21:45,770 --> 03:21:47,840
Loves Punch was on a show like this.

7589
03:21:47,841 --> 03:21:48,674
On twitch?

7590
03:21:49,010 --> 03:21:49,151
Yeah,

7591
03:21:49,151 --> 03:21:49,760
apparently.

7592
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:50,390
Yeah.

7593
03:21:50,390 --> 03:21:54,210
On twitch yet p I think jeans and,

7594
03:21:54,230 --> 03:21:57,560
and [inaudible] are doing
it on their mom's house.

7595
03:21:57,620 --> 03:21:58,630
Tom and Christina,

7596
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:00,080
other hip,

7597
03:22:00,080 --> 03:22:00,710
they're cool.

7598
03:22:00,710 --> 03:22:01,543
They're doing,

7599
03:22:02,140 --> 03:22:03,170
they're doing twitch as well.

7600
03:22:04,060 --> 03:22:04,820
Have you looked into it?

7601
03:22:04,820 --> 03:22:05,653
Jamie?

7602
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:06,561
Myself,

7603
03:22:06,561 --> 03:22:07,490
but I play video games,

7604
03:22:07,491 --> 03:22:09,140
but it's expanded over the last,

7605
03:22:09,230 --> 03:22:09,561
I don't know,

7606
03:22:09,561 --> 03:22:11,870
a year to two more than video games.

7607
03:22:11,900 --> 03:22:13,040
There's podcast sections,

7608
03:22:13,041 --> 03:22:14,150
there's music sections.

7609
03:22:14,480 --> 03:22:15,950
They tried to do like a comedy section.

7610
03:22:15,951 --> 03:22:18,350
Even they're trying to entice people
to do stand up comedy on there.

7611
03:22:19,210 --> 03:22:19,370
Yeah,

7612
03:22:19,370 --> 03:22:20,151
it's a terrible idea,

7613
03:22:20,151 --> 03:22:21,230
but that doesn't work.

7614
03:22:22,260 --> 03:22:22,850
But there's tons,

7615
03:22:22,850 --> 03:22:25,190
there's tons more than
just video games on there.

7616
03:22:25,191 --> 03:22:25,520
Now.

7617
03:22:25,520 --> 03:22:26,930
When people first started doing podcasts.

7618
03:22:26,931 --> 03:22:30,260
One guy asked me to do as podcasts
and then asked me to do stand up.

7619
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:34,100
They do it the live podcasts he wanted
me to do stand up on the podcast.

7620
03:22:34,460 --> 03:22:34,970
I go,

7621
03:22:34,970 --> 03:22:36,110
what are you talking about?

7622
03:22:36,200 --> 03:22:36,441
I go,

7623
03:22:36,441 --> 03:22:38,420
do you want me to do
my act on your show to,

7624
03:22:39,200 --> 03:22:40,790
and then it just gets
released on the Internet.

7625
03:22:40,820 --> 03:22:41,653
I just do it that way.

7626
03:22:42,080 --> 03:22:44,000
Instead of just getting
paid for comedy central,

7627
03:22:44,660 --> 03:22:45,321
Netflix special,

7628
03:22:45,321 --> 03:22:46,370
like what are you talking about it?

7629
03:22:46,790 --> 03:22:47,630
Why would they do that?

7630
03:22:48,580 --> 03:22:49,311
And you just,

7631
03:22:49,311 --> 03:22:50,240
and you're just going to sell it.

7632
03:22:50,241 --> 03:22:50,840
No idea.

7633
03:22:50,840 --> 03:22:52,630
He just going to sell this
podcast to put it out and well,

7634
03:22:52,650 --> 03:22:53,660
how much do I get out of this?

7635
03:22:53,661 --> 03:22:54,170
Zero.

7636
03:22:54,170 --> 03:22:54,471
Okay,

7637
03:22:54,471 --> 03:22:55,300
that sounds like a good deal.

7638
03:22:55,300 --> 03:22:56,420
My materials out there,

7639
03:22:58,520 --> 03:23:00,590
but that was early days of podcasting.

7640
03:23:00,650 --> 03:23:02,750
He was trying to figure out
what the hell it was like,

7641
03:23:02,751 --> 03:23:03,471
what is this thing?

7642
03:23:03,471 --> 03:23:04,280
It's hilarious.

7643
03:23:04,280 --> 03:23:04,361
This,

7644
03:23:04,361 --> 03:23:05,300
it's just a joke.

7645
03:23:05,350 --> 03:23:06,500
Is Anybody paying attention?

7646
03:23:06,530 --> 03:23:07,290
Who's watching?

7647
03:23:07,290 --> 03:23:08,210
Little did they know?

7648
03:23:08,260 --> 03:23:08,401
Yeah.

7649
03:23:08,401 --> 03:23:08,901
It's just,

7650
03:23:08,901 --> 03:23:09,140
uh,

7651
03:23:09,140 --> 03:23:12,800
I remember Kevin Smith was one of the
first guys who take it seriously because

7652
03:23:12,801 --> 03:23:13,790
he rented a theater.

7653
03:23:13,791 --> 03:23:15,350
He had a theater on Melrose.

7654
03:23:15,890 --> 03:23:16,521
It was like,

7655
03:23:16,521 --> 03:23:17,030
um,

7656
03:23:17,030 --> 03:23:19,640
the smog cast theater and uh,

7657
03:23:19,641 --> 03:23:20,810
we used it once.

7658
03:23:20,870 --> 03:23:21,920
I used it once,

7659
03:23:21,921 --> 03:23:23,060
the interview

7660
03:23:24,980 --> 03:23:26,780
was it Tom Green and Jim Norton,

7661
03:23:27,110 --> 03:23:29,900
I think I did two podcasts there.

7662
03:23:29,960 --> 03:23:31,940
I did one with Tom Green
and one with Jim Norton.

7663
03:23:32,150 --> 03:23:32,451
Yeah.

7664
03:23:32,451 --> 03:23:33,200
It was interesting.

7665
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:33,770
It was cool.

7666
03:23:33,770 --> 03:23:34,603
It's different.

7667
03:23:34,850 --> 03:23:35,511
It's interesting,

7668
03:23:35,511 --> 03:23:36,141
but it's different.

7669
03:23:36,141 --> 03:23:36,351
Yeah.

7670
03:23:36,351 --> 03:23:38,470
Doing it live in front of
an audience is different.

7671
03:23:38,840 --> 03:23:39,673
It's not like,

7672
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:42,770
do you guys still do live fighter
and the kid shows we don't,

7673
03:23:42,980 --> 03:23:43,850
he don't know.

7674
03:23:43,880 --> 03:23:45,290
Too busy with both of your standup.

7675
03:23:45,291 --> 03:23:45,771
Too busy.

7676
03:23:45,771 --> 03:23:46,320
Yeah.

7677
03:23:46,320 --> 03:23:46,940
Yeah.

7678
03:23:46,940 --> 03:23:47,481
Rare.

7679
03:23:47,481 --> 03:23:47,781
Brian,

7680
03:23:47,781 --> 03:23:49,970
I get together live show.

7681
03:23:49,971 --> 03:23:52,280
I guess that's good because
it means you're both busy.

7682
03:23:52,281 --> 03:23:55,770
Cause that's exactly the same thing
that happened like me and Joey and uh,

7683
03:23:55,810 --> 03:23:58,280
and even me when me and
Ari and me and Dunkin,

7684
03:23:58,281 --> 03:24:00,560
it's like everybody else just got too big.

7685
03:24:00,830 --> 03:24:01,251
You know,

7686
03:24:01,251 --> 03:24:03,680
Ari's just headline
these giant ass places.

7687
03:24:03,681 --> 03:24:08,570
Now when Joey's headline and giant ass
places and you know [inaudible] selling

7688
03:24:08,571 --> 03:24:10,910
out everything all across the country.

7689
03:24:11,480 --> 03:24:12,313
Yeah.

7690
03:24:12,590 --> 03:24:13,760
It's just how it goes.

7691
03:24:13,790 --> 03:24:14,360
You know,

7692
03:24:14,360 --> 03:24:15,140
if you're,

7693
03:24:15,140 --> 03:24:16,580
you're doing stuff with people,

7694
03:24:16,581 --> 03:24:20,120
eventually they wind up doing
something else and you know,

7695
03:24:20,630 --> 03:24:21,291
I know you,

7696
03:24:21,291 --> 03:24:23,540
you are doing really well
with your standup comedy.

7697
03:24:23,780 --> 03:24:24,680
It's probably hard to do.

7698
03:24:24,681 --> 03:24:26,750
Those shows still shows
her a different thing.

7699
03:24:26,751 --> 03:24:27,200
Right.

7700
03:24:27,200 --> 03:24:29,510
It takes away from what I'm doing,

7701
03:24:29,630 --> 03:24:29,931
you know,

7702
03:24:29,931 --> 03:24:30,830
like the original goal,

7703
03:24:30,831 --> 03:24:33,590
like if I'm going to
dedicate time and stage,

7704
03:24:33,620 --> 03:24:35,330
it's going to be to my right.

7705
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:37,340
Especially because you kind of have to,

7706
03:24:37,370 --> 03:24:38,330
if you want a headline,

7707
03:24:38,331 --> 03:24:42,810
places keep pumping out new shit
and you want to do a special,

7708
03:24:43,190 --> 03:24:45,060
as much as fun as that
have with the lifeline,

7709
03:24:45,090 --> 03:24:45,541
the kids,

7710
03:24:45,541 --> 03:24:46,740
it was the exact opposite.

7711
03:24:46,741 --> 03:24:46,970
Like,

7712
03:24:46,970 --> 03:24:47,180
no,

7713
03:24:47,180 --> 03:24:50,860
it was just improv and me and Brian
Dicken Ram was the time we can,

7714
03:24:50,861 --> 03:24:53,190
I can better than anything
at the time with your buddy,

7715
03:24:53,250 --> 03:24:53,461
right?

7716
03:24:53,461 --> 03:24:54,190
You're not making your,

7717
03:24:54,190 --> 03:24:55,140
your act stronger.

7718
03:24:55,560 --> 03:24:56,620
Piecing up your materials.

7719
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:57,451
I read the last one.

7720
03:24:57,451 --> 03:25:00,000
I told Brian this what me and
him did one at the comedy store.

7721
03:25:00,120 --> 03:25:00,511
I don't know,

7722
03:25:00,511 --> 03:25:01,950
like a year at least ago.

7723
03:25:01,951 --> 03:25:03,600
Year and a half maybe we got done.

7724
03:25:03,601 --> 03:25:03,841
I was like,

7725
03:25:03,841 --> 03:25:04,710
I'm done with these dude.

7726
03:25:04,920 --> 03:25:05,753
Wow.

7727
03:25:06,210 --> 03:25:06,301
Oh,

7728
03:25:06,301 --> 03:25:07,350
you had a weird one,

7729
03:25:07,351 --> 03:25:07,650
right?

7730
03:25:07,650 --> 03:25:09,620
It was one of them that came
out weird at the comedy store.

7731
03:25:09,621 --> 03:25:11,180
It's just wasn't weird bookie.

7732
03:25:11,280 --> 03:25:12,061
He was clunky.

7733
03:25:12,061 --> 03:25:12,320
Yeah.

7734
03:25:12,320 --> 03:25:12,541
Yeah.

7735
03:25:12,541 --> 03:25:14,460
Cause we haven't been together
a while and we did that.

7736
03:25:14,461 --> 03:25:14,701
I'm like,

7737
03:25:14,701 --> 03:25:15,210
dude,

7738
03:25:15,210 --> 03:25:17,310
this isn't the best product for you or me.

7739
03:25:17,350 --> 03:25:17,600
Right.

7740
03:25:17,600 --> 03:25:18,670
It makes us look bad.

7741
03:25:18,830 --> 03:25:20,790
I feel like I can write.

7742
03:25:20,791 --> 03:25:22,800
I think you got to respect what that is.

7743
03:25:22,801 --> 03:25:24,810
If we're going to do like a two man show,

7744
03:25:25,130 --> 03:25:27,720
he got to coordinate the shit out
of that requires a lot of work.

7745
03:25:27,730 --> 03:25:28,710
Can't wing it.

7746
03:25:28,740 --> 03:25:31,980
Especially from people going
from pain to see you do stand up.

7747
03:25:31,981 --> 03:25:33,000
They see your standard back,

7748
03:25:33,001 --> 03:25:33,690
which is,

7749
03:25:33,690 --> 03:25:34,740
you know what it is.

7750
03:25:34,741 --> 03:25:36,300
They go from seeing that to that.

7751
03:25:36,480 --> 03:25:39,330
I felt like it was hurting
the brand or anything.

7752
03:25:39,360 --> 03:25:40,193
That makes sense.

7753
03:25:40,620 --> 03:25:41,240
Yeah.

7754
03:25:41,240 --> 03:25:42,580
I think Brian agreed to and that,

7755
03:25:42,610 --> 03:25:42,990
you know,

7756
03:25:42,990 --> 03:25:45,780
but like we did a show together
with Ari and big J and that,

7757
03:25:45,781 --> 03:25:46,440
that was fun.

7758
03:25:46,440 --> 03:25:47,273
That was fine.

7759
03:25:48,450 --> 03:25:49,320
That was a,

7760
03:25:49,350 --> 03:25:49,981
there was a,

7761
03:25:49,981 --> 03:25:50,731
all things comedy.

7762
03:25:50,731 --> 03:25:51,810
They're doing a festival down there.

7763
03:25:51,930 --> 03:25:54,270
US brought us all in all things comedy.

7764
03:25:54,271 --> 03:25:55,170
He's doing a lot of shit,

7765
03:25:55,171 --> 03:25:55,500
man.

7766
03:25:55,500 --> 03:25:56,333
They're killing it.

7767
03:25:57,450 --> 03:25:58,500
They're doing specials.

7768
03:25:58,790 --> 03:25:58,891
Yeah,

7769
03:25:58,891 --> 03:25:59,580
they can do,

7770
03:25:59,580 --> 03:26:00,960
they're doing Ian Edwards special.

7771
03:26:01,020 --> 03:26:01,853
Are they really?

7772
03:26:02,060 --> 03:26:02,820
That's dope.

7773
03:26:02,820 --> 03:26:03,001
Oh,

7774
03:26:03,001 --> 03:26:03,834
Yay.

7775
03:26:03,930 --> 03:26:05,040
Comedy central game especially.

7776
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:07,980
But there's something with
that and like Ari Feo,

7777
03:26:07,981 --> 03:26:09,930
Brian Big Jay and I were
all talking about like,

7778
03:26:10,110 --> 03:26:11,640
we could do the same way.

7779
03:26:12,070 --> 03:26:12,903
Um,

7780
03:26:13,070 --> 03:26:15,300
frickin they did the white comedy tour.

7781
03:26:15,330 --> 03:26:17,150
Blue was at plu coming
toward white coming here.

7782
03:26:17,160 --> 03:26:17,993
Where the fuck it was.

7783
03:26:18,120 --> 03:26:18,571
You could do,

7784
03:26:18,571 --> 03:26:20,070
we could do that once a month.

7785
03:26:20,190 --> 03:26:21,420
Just pick one city dude.

7786
03:26:21,450 --> 03:26:23,490
Like two big ass shows and get out.

7787
03:26:23,630 --> 03:26:24,000
Yeah.

7788
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:24,420
But dude,

7789
03:26:24,420 --> 03:26:25,800
like announced a tour with it.

7790
03:26:25,920 --> 03:26:26,753
Yeah.

7791
03:26:27,180 --> 03:26:27,511
Yeah,

7792
03:26:27,511 --> 03:26:28,080
definitely.

7793
03:26:28,080 --> 03:26:28,913
It'd be fun.

7794
03:26:29,130 --> 03:26:29,491
You know,

7795
03:26:29,491 --> 03:26:32,580
and also like you're
doing comedy clubs too,

7796
03:26:32,730 --> 03:26:36,450
which is so important at this stage of
like when you're trying to ramp up to a

7797
03:26:36,451 --> 03:26:37,560
special in January,

7798
03:26:37,920 --> 03:26:40,770
you've got to do a lot of comedy clubs
because you get those to show at nights

7799
03:26:40,771 --> 03:26:41,880
and two shows.

7800
03:26:41,881 --> 03:26:42,810
Friday two shows.

7801
03:26:42,811 --> 03:26:47,811
Saturday one Thursday tooth
to Friday to Saturday.

7802
03:26:48,060 --> 03:26:48,750
If that's good.

7803
03:26:48,750 --> 03:26:50,220
Thursday's a warmup set.

7804
03:26:50,460 --> 03:26:51,090
Yes.

7805
03:26:51,090 --> 03:26:54,030
Get things and get that bitch hot.

7806
03:26:54,090 --> 03:26:54,330
Yeah.

7807
03:26:54,330 --> 03:26:55,163
Ooh,

7808
03:26:55,270 --> 03:26:57,060
come in guns blazing on Friday.

7809
03:26:57,090 --> 03:26:58,700
I tell you what's weird to to,

7810
03:26:59,100 --> 03:27:01,660
to relate it to fighting is
that I was like go fuck him.

7811
03:27:01,710 --> 03:27:03,710
I'm about nine weeks out from the special.

7812
03:27:03,720 --> 03:27:04,710
It almost feels like you're like,

7813
03:27:04,711 --> 03:27:06,090
damn you gotta I dunno.

7814
03:27:06,240 --> 03:27:06,661
I think you know,

7815
03:27:06,661 --> 03:27:09,900
he say that Louis C K he used
to treat it like it was a fight.

7816
03:27:09,940 --> 03:27:13,320
You'd go running and get in shape
and run like five miles a day.

7817
03:27:13,500 --> 03:27:17,890
He'd be like ramp up like actual physical
training to prepare for comedy special

7818
03:27:17,891 --> 03:27:18,691
10 my Diet's,

7819
03:27:18,691 --> 03:27:19,401
I'm sweating now,

7820
03:27:19,401 --> 03:27:20,940
my diet and my workouts.

7821
03:27:21,330 --> 03:27:21,690
Well,

7822
03:27:21,690 --> 03:27:23,730
what I learned from this sober October,

7823
03:27:23,790 --> 03:27:25,090
a workout challenge,

7824
03:27:25,140 --> 03:27:30,030
fitness challenges that Ari and Tom and
Burt and I did was that when you work

7825
03:27:30,031 --> 03:27:31,230
out a lot like that,

7826
03:27:31,260 --> 03:27:32,820
you do a shit ton of cardio.

7827
03:27:32,880 --> 03:27:34,170
You don't give a fuck.

7828
03:27:34,200 --> 03:27:36,270
You're anxiety is severely,

7829
03:27:36,480 --> 03:27:37,950
severely diminished.

7830
03:27:38,340 --> 03:27:39,570
You feel so good.

7831
03:27:39,750 --> 03:27:41,860
It's crazy when you do a lot cardio

7832
03:27:42,130 --> 03:27:46,750
like I was doing on a normal
day at any average day,

7833
03:27:46,751 --> 03:27:48,690
I might be working out three
and a half hour too much.

7834
03:27:48,820 --> 03:27:49,480
That's crazy.

7835
03:27:49,480 --> 03:27:50,520
Crazy too much,

7836
03:27:50,770 --> 03:27:51,790
but it was just for a month,

7837
03:27:52,210 --> 03:27:53,680
but the point was that,

7838
03:27:53,860 --> 03:27:55,500
and I don't think you need
to do three and a half hours,

7839
03:27:55,501 --> 03:27:56,800
but you might need to do an hour.

7840
03:27:57,010 --> 03:27:58,660
If you can do an hour of hard cardio,

7841
03:27:58,661 --> 03:28:00,940
you don't give a fuck.

7842
03:28:00,970 --> 03:28:01,803
That's what I tried to do.

7843
03:28:01,850 --> 03:28:04,810
Shell 60 minutes of
hard where I'm burning.

7844
03:28:04,811 --> 03:28:05,260
Yeah,

7845
03:28:05,260 --> 03:28:06,520
800,000 calories.

7846
03:28:06,550 --> 03:28:07,390
That's all you have to do.

7847
03:28:07,450 --> 03:28:07,960
That's it.

7848
03:28:07,960 --> 03:28:08,380
Yeah.

7849
03:28:08,380 --> 03:28:08,711
Dude,

7850
03:28:08,711 --> 03:28:09,190
I fee.

7851
03:28:09,190 --> 03:28:11,830
I feel really good when
I work out like that.

7852
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:12,551
If I don't,

7853
03:28:12,551 --> 03:28:13,840
I feel like my demeanor,

7854
03:28:13,841 --> 03:28:14,770
I'm not as fun.

7855
03:28:14,771 --> 03:28:17,120
I'm now creative,

7856
03:28:17,140 --> 03:28:18,880
like I don't feel great too though,

7857
03:28:18,881 --> 03:28:20,080
saying that if it was a pill,

7858
03:28:20,320 --> 03:28:24,050
if you give someone a pill and that pill
could make me feel like I feel after I

7859
03:28:24,060 --> 03:28:26,050
work out for three and a
half hours addicted to it,

7860
03:28:26,100 --> 03:28:27,100
I would take that pill every day.

7861
03:28:27,520 --> 03:28:27,970
That's some,

7862
03:28:27,970 --> 03:28:30,250
I don't give a fuck juice
called Oxycontin Joe.

7863
03:28:30,251 --> 03:28:30,750
But what it,

7864
03:28:30,750 --> 03:28:31,583
no,

7865
03:28:31,820 --> 03:28:33,070
it doesn't change who you are.

7866
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:35,230
Like if you get a spelling bee,

7867
03:28:35,231 --> 03:28:38,470
I fuck up the same words account the same.

7868
03:28:38,920 --> 03:28:40,420
And that was the thing was interesting.

7869
03:28:40,421 --> 03:28:43,570
Like I was worried it was going to
negatively affect my podcast because I was

7870
03:28:43,571 --> 03:28:44,800
worried that I'd be too tired.

7871
03:28:45,070 --> 03:28:45,640
I come in here,

7872
03:28:45,640 --> 03:28:47,410
I'd just be ragdoll and beaten down,

7873
03:28:47,440 --> 03:28:48,273
but I wasn't,

7874
03:28:48,420 --> 03:28:49,540
you shed more than energy.

7875
03:28:49,541 --> 03:28:49,770
Right.

7876
03:28:49,770 --> 03:28:50,620
And a lot of energy.

7877
03:28:50,621 --> 03:28:51,071
Like Jamie,

7878
03:28:51,071 --> 03:28:52,840
I didn't seem like any slower or anything,

7879
03:28:52,841 --> 03:28:53,674
did I?

7880
03:28:54,400 --> 03:28:54,731
You know,

7881
03:28:54,731 --> 03:28:56,740
it fucks me up and we've
talked about this before.

7882
03:28:56,770 --> 03:28:57,220
What's that?

7883
03:28:57,220 --> 03:28:59,170
Fucking yoga classes too.

7884
03:28:59,171 --> 03:29:01,450
And I do a 90 minute yoga
class and I come in here,

7885
03:29:01,480 --> 03:29:03,250
I am way more fucked up.

7886
03:29:03,251 --> 03:29:03,820
Fuck yeah.

7887
03:29:03,820 --> 03:29:05,500
Because that mental energy with that,

7888
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:06,730
it's not just that,

7889
03:29:06,731 --> 03:29:07,750
it's like what you're,

7890
03:29:08,080 --> 03:29:12,310
what you're doing to elevate your heart
rate is so much more exhausting to your

7891
03:29:12,311 --> 03:29:17,311
muscles than say running for cause
you can't hold the yoga path.

7892
03:29:18,360 --> 03:29:21,010
A yoga pose for as long as you can run,

7893
03:29:21,340 --> 03:29:24,640
you can run like for
hours and you've been,

7894
03:29:24,641 --> 03:29:25,031
you're not,

7895
03:29:25,031 --> 03:29:27,880
you're not doing and you're going left,

7896
03:29:27,881 --> 03:29:28,241
right,

7897
03:29:28,241 --> 03:29:28,541
left,

7898
03:29:28,541 --> 03:29:28,900
right.

7899
03:29:28,900 --> 03:29:31,090
It's just like this steady push,

7900
03:29:31,150 --> 03:29:31,990
relax,

7901
03:29:31,991 --> 03:29:32,400
push,

7902
03:29:32,400 --> 03:29:32,981
relaxing your,

7903
03:29:32,981 --> 03:29:33,520
your,

7904
03:29:33,520 --> 03:29:36,280
your legs have like a half a
second to recover with each step.

7905
03:29:36,490 --> 03:29:37,480
That's what's going on.

7906
03:29:37,481 --> 03:29:39,280
But it's different because yoga,

7907
03:29:39,281 --> 03:29:40,120
you could never do that.

7908
03:29:40,121 --> 03:29:41,470
Like when you're in a yoga pose,

7909
03:29:41,471 --> 03:29:42,071
like you're in,

7910
03:29:42,071 --> 03:29:42,720
um,

7911
03:29:42,720 --> 03:29:43,110
you know,

7912
03:29:43,110 --> 03:29:44,500
triangle pose or something like that.

7913
03:29:44,920 --> 03:29:46,810
How long can you hold that Hoodie?

7914
03:29:46,840 --> 03:29:47,740
Keep Ahold of it minute.

7915
03:29:47,800 --> 03:29:48,251
Can you hold it?

7916
03:29:48,251 --> 03:29:49,084
Five minutes.

7917
03:29:49,210 --> 03:29:53,410
Maybe you're in fucking tremendous shape
and you could do the bow pose where you

7918
03:29:53,411 --> 03:29:56,080
hold your foot and you put it
over behind you and you have,

7919
03:29:56,440 --> 03:30:00,330
maybe you could do that for five
minutes if you were in fucking Chad.

7920
03:30:00,510 --> 03:30:01,331
Tremendous,

7921
03:30:01,331 --> 03:30:02,350
tremendous shape.

7922
03:30:02,770 --> 03:30:03,251
But damn,

7923
03:30:03,251 --> 03:30:04,630
that is hard to do.

7924
03:30:04,990 --> 03:30:06,160
What does that Jamie scorecards,

7925
03:30:06,250 --> 03:30:07,750
everyone had Korean Zombie up.

7926
03:30:08,670 --> 03:30:09,310
Yeah.

7927
03:30:09,310 --> 03:30:13,770
Set for one gut sit for one judge
or one judge had even going in.

7928
03:30:14,380 --> 03:30:16,810
Other judges had green on every card.

7929
03:30:18,190 --> 03:30:19,023
Mm.

7930
03:30:19,150 --> 03:30:20,010
So someone at two,

7931
03:30:20,020 --> 03:30:21,100
two others at three.

7932
03:30:21,101 --> 03:30:21,881
One three,

7933
03:30:21,881 --> 03:30:22,241
one three,

7934
03:30:22,241 --> 03:30:22,421
one,

7935
03:30:22,421 --> 03:30:22,571
two,

7936
03:30:22,571 --> 03:30:23,230
two.

7937
03:30:23,230 --> 03:30:24,063
Interesting.

7938
03:30:24,070 --> 03:30:24,903
What a KL.

7939
03:30:25,090 --> 03:30:26,370
What Amazing Cook Kale.

7940
03:30:26,570 --> 03:30:27,130
All right.

7941
03:30:27,130 --> 03:30:27,461
All right,

7942
03:30:27,461 --> 03:30:28,420
let's wrap this bitch up.

7943
03:30:28,450 --> 03:30:30,310
Everybody out there being
affected by the fires.

7944
03:30:30,311 --> 03:30:33,190
We genuinely and sincerely hope
you and your family are safe.

7945
03:30:33,310 --> 03:30:33,880
Uh,

7946
03:30:33,880 --> 03:30:34,121
it's,

7947
03:30:34,121 --> 03:30:36,130
it sucks if you lose your place,

7948
03:30:36,131 --> 03:30:36,821
but you know,

7949
03:30:36,821 --> 03:30:38,380
it's way worse if you're dead.

7950
03:30:39,110 --> 03:30:39,500
Um,

7951
03:30:39,500 --> 03:30:42,470
what's positive is your friends and
your family and your loved ones.

7952
03:30:42,471 --> 03:30:43,760
And that means a lot to me right now.

7953
03:30:43,761 --> 03:30:46,610
So I'm thinking about it even
though I'm evacuated and uh,

7954
03:30:46,611 --> 03:30:47,121
I'm sure,

7955
03:30:47,121 --> 03:30:47,870
uh,

7956
03:30:47,870 --> 03:30:48,261
I know,

7957
03:30:48,261 --> 03:30:50,450
I already know people that for
sure have lost their houses,

7958
03:30:51,110 --> 03:30:52,160
but uh,

7959
03:30:52,190 --> 03:30:53,420
we'd feel a whole lot worse.

7960
03:30:53,420 --> 03:30:54,253
We lost them,

7961
03:30:54,410 --> 03:30:54,651
you know,

7962
03:30:54,651 --> 03:30:55,550
it's hard to deal with.

7963
03:30:55,580 --> 03:30:56,300
It's rough.

7964
03:30:56,300 --> 03:30:57,230
It's not a good thing,

7965
03:30:57,440 --> 03:31:01,940
but it's also a humbling reminder of
where we are and that nature is a thing to

7966
03:31:01,941 --> 03:31:03,530
be respected and feared.

7967
03:31:03,920 --> 03:31:05,300
And when fire gets out of hand,

7968
03:31:05,570 --> 03:31:08,510
there's some serious fucking consequences
and I don't know what solutions there

7969
03:31:08,511 --> 03:31:10,520
are to fixing something like this,

7970
03:31:10,760 --> 03:31:15,760
but I think if there was a an invading
army that came here and did the kind of

7971
03:31:16,251 --> 03:31:18,890
damage and devastation that
these forest fires have done,

7972
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:22,430
there would be some serious steps
to protect us against that army.

7973
03:31:22,730 --> 03:31:27,260
If there is a profit to be
made and figuring out how
to protect people from this

7974
03:31:27,261 --> 03:31:31,280
kind of fucking horrendous fire like
well I don't know what it would be.

7975
03:31:31,281 --> 03:31:35,390
I don't know what would be hiring way
more firefighters or putting way more

7976
03:31:35,391 --> 03:31:37,280
precautions in place or,

7977
03:31:37,281 --> 03:31:42,281
or hiring people and Donald Trump creating
new jobs to clear all this dead wood

7978
03:31:42,951 --> 03:31:44,260
and the in the forest and,

7979
03:31:44,530 --> 03:31:49,190
and to figure out some way to get to the
scene quicker and have flights that are

7980
03:31:49,191 --> 03:31:52,220
ready on standby filled
with water at all times.

7981
03:31:52,220 --> 03:31:53,390
I don't know what the fuck it would be,

7982
03:31:53,900 --> 03:31:58,900
but it seems to me that these things
when they get out of hand like this,

7983
03:32:00,200 --> 03:32:03,620
leave people unusually helpless.

7984
03:32:04,010 --> 03:32:06,100
Like we're oftentimes help us to nature.

7985
03:32:06,650 --> 03:32:07,071
This is,

7986
03:32:07,071 --> 03:32:10,850
this is one of those unusually helpless
moments where it makes you really

7987
03:32:10,851 --> 03:32:13,640
understand how dangerous fire is and,

7988
03:32:13,641 --> 03:32:14,450
uh,

7989
03:32:14,450 --> 03:32:17,630
nothing but love and respect out there
for all the firefighters and first

7990
03:32:17,631 --> 03:32:19,970
responders and all these people
that are taking care of people.

7991
03:32:19,971 --> 03:32:20,380
And,

7992
03:32:20,380 --> 03:32:21,660
and shout out to Whitney coming,

7993
03:32:21,661 --> 03:32:24,500
saving animals are girls
out there in Malibu.

7994
03:32:24,540 --> 03:32:25,670
Save an animals,

7995
03:32:25,820 --> 03:32:26,690
bringing them to shelter.

7996
03:32:26,691 --> 03:32:27,740
She saved horses,

7997
03:32:27,770 --> 03:32:28,790
chickens and shit.

7998
03:32:28,820 --> 03:32:30,740
She likes channels people.

7999
03:32:30,741 --> 03:32:30,951
Yeah,

8000
03:32:30,951 --> 03:32:32,300
she's always been an animal person.

8001
03:32:32,840 --> 03:32:33,210
Pov.

8002
03:32:33,210 --> 03:32:33,820
Whitney Cummings.

8003
03:32:33,820 --> 03:32:34,100
All right.

8004
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:35,810
Thank you to you all much love.

8005
03:32:35,811 --> 03:32:36,320
Bye.
