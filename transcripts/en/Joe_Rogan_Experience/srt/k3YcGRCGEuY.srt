1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,210
In four,
three,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,800
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,070
Hey Jimmy.
What's up?

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,160
Hi Joe.
How you doing?

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,870
Doing good now we're on the radio.
Fantastic.

6
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:18,290
It's 3:31
minutes before 4:00.

7
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,240
Here's vow with the weather.
Hot.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,950
Hottest.
Fuck back to you Jimmy.

9
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:26,951
Bob.
So how are we going to car fire in the 

10
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:28,990
breakdown lane.
So you were getting emotional in the 

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,200
green room listening to Henry rollins 
talk about Putin.

12
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,430
You're about to quote Chomsky like.
Yes.

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,970
So he was,
I just caught the end of it.

14
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:36,380
I sent,
went in the green room and I like,

15
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:37,790
you know,
everybody loves Henry Rollins.

16
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:41,810
Right?
And Sam Henry twice.

17
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:45,110
So good.
He's constantly grinding.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,420
Yeah.
But he was doing that thing about.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,270
Oh,
poot.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,430
And you know there was a journalist who 
wrote a book about them,

21
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,190
ended up dead.
Putin's a bad guy.

22
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:55,590
He's a bad guy as opposed to who?
Well,

23
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,250
no,
but he,

24
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,100
you,
you mean he's definitely a bad guy,

25
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,430
right?

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,270
We all agree that course.
But I mean just because other people are

27
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:07,271
also bad guys.
It doesn't negate his point of Putin 

28
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:07,370
being a bad guy.
What he was saying is just that.

29
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:12,371
It's very bizarre that the Republicans,
these people that were at the forefront 

30
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,590
of the Cold War,
these ones always,

31
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,860
I mean these are the people that 
remember Khrushchev Banging on the desk 

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:19,970
saying,
we'll bury you with,

33
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,020
with Kennedy and these people are now 
like the whitewashing Putin.

34
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,080
They're essentially like trying to paint
out Putin to be a good guy because trump

35
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,650
is in this position where he's trying to
be friends with this guy.

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,540
So.

37
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,750
Well here's the quote I wanted to send 
you.

38
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,310
Right?
So that whole thing,

39
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:42,320
if,
if Nuremberg laws were applied,

40
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:47,321
then every post war American president 
would have been hanged since says Noam 

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,570
Chomsky,
a Putin kills journalists.

42
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:53,070
We just torture hours.
Let me.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,420
Chelsea manning is a whistleblower.
We took Brock Obama torture.

44
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,810
So we have our president,
we have presidents and vice presidents 

45
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,030
who are legit war criminals that walk 
around today,

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,220
that a torture program.
Okay.

47
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,480
So,
uh,

48
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:13,510
you know,
Barack Obama got a peace prize and then 

49
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,731
he had a kill list.
How a peace prize winner with a kill 

50
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:17,060
list at drone kill it.
Would you keep the kill list next to the

51
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:19,220
peace prize?
Where do you keep those two things?

52
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:24,221
Are they anyway,
so that's some of the people that were 

53
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:24,221
killed were American citizens with no 
due process,

54
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:27,610
no due process.
And so nobody has a problem with trump.

55
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:32,611
Being buddy buddies with Benjamin 
Netanyahu is a psychopathic maniac who 

56
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,890
shoots,
who shoots with precision,

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,160
uh,
medics who are trying to help people in 

58
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,310
nurses hand journalists,
by the way.

59
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,470
Well,
some is really true.

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,530
Israeli troops do that.
That's a really depressing thing.

61
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,860
You know,
I had abby Martin on and she sort of 

62
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,410
illuminated that whole situation to me.
I really didn't know how bad it was,

63
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,840
nor did she until she went over there.
Right.

64
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,000
And you know,
just experiencing what it's like the,

65
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,980
it's crazy that people that went through
the

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Holocaust that realize the cost of 
dehumanizing an entire race of people 

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,590
now are capable,
at least some of them are capable of 

68
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:10,590
doing that to the Palestinians.

69
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,440
Yeah.
It's,

70
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,810
it's,
it's kind of mind blowing.

71
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:15,600
So I want to hear,
and I have friends who do that.

72
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,660
Everyone's doing this right?
Everyone's getting caught up in this 

73
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,091
hysteria.
That's why there's a word called 

74
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:23,091
hysteria because it happens and Lauryn 
one,

75
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:27,320
and you know what I like is what Noam 
Chomsky said about this Russia hysteria 

76
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,330
that's happening.
He said,

77
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:30,780
if you care about effects on our 
pristine elections,

78
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:33,210
which he said very sarcastically,
he said,

79
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:36,450
if you care about what's affecting our 
pristine elections to Russia,

80
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,560
gate is the last place I would look,
and the first place he would look.

81
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:45,561
If you're worried about four and a 
control of or influence on our 

82
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,320
government.
He said he would look to Israel.

83
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:49,470
They're the ones.
Benjamin Netanyahu came here and address

84
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:54,471
the joint session of Congress without 
the permission or invitation of the 

85
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:54,471
president,
my bro,

86
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,160
when Obama was president and he did 
that.

87
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,190
He did that.
That's a guy coming here to tell our 

88
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,220
guys how to vote in direct defiance of 
our president and everyone embraced him.

89
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,250
Can you imagine the food and did that 
boot and came to America and addressed 

90
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,250
the joint session of Congress against 
the will of the president.

91
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,670
So this idea that somehow because Putin 
is a bad guy,

92
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,410
trump shouldn't have a good friendship 
with them.

93
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,950
Is Bs the guys who are really 
influencing our government.

94
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:19,170
Here are Benjamin Netanyahu,
Saudi Arabia,

95
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:23,360
but trump opened eight businesses in 
Saudi Arabia during the election.

96
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,820
No one gives a crap about any of that 
stuff because they're our friends.

97
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,990
Saudi Arabia,
by the way,

98
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:30,630
just bombed us school today.
A school bus,

99
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:32,500
29 kids dead.
So yeah,

100
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,130
I just retweeted that from Sarah Abdula.
So,

101
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,390
uh,
why would they do that?

102
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:37,480
Because they're in Yemen.
They're,

103
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,760
they're,
they're bombing.

104
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,250
We were committing genocide in Yemen 
right now.

105
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,420
So we're helping Saudi Arabia committed 
genocide in Yemen.

106
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,990
And the way we're doing it is they're 
doing a thing called siege warfare,

107
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,170
which is a war crime.
And we just,

108
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,200
in fact they just prosecuted someone a 
few months ago in a,

109
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,920
at the Hague for it.
So,

110
00:04:55,921 --> 00:05:00,921
but since we're doing it and we're the 
enforcers and Saudi Arabia is on the 

111
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,760
human rights council.
So everything's a joke now,

112
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,160
right?
So we were past it where it's a farce.

113
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,010
We're living in this forest.
And so when I see a guy that I love,

114
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:10,680
like Henry Rollins,
I'm saying stuff like,

115
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,630
oh Putin's this special,
kind of bad.

116
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,240
I just called back Chomsky out.
We have nothing.

117
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:19,500
We have legit war criminals.
Just one presidency away.

118
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,230
Do you think he's a step removed from 
that though?

119
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,900
I mean he,
he'll assassinate journalists in his own

120
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,930
country right now.
Right now we're trying to assassinate 

121
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,440
Julian assange right now are trying to 
do.

122
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,960
They're trying to kill that guy.
Yes.

123
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:36,690
They want at that guy dead heavily.
Hillary Clinton's campaign.

124
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,210
We drone that guy,
can't we kill them?

125
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,610
And she really did say that.
She really did say that after she just 

126
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,130
got done killing Kadafi and then laughed
about it,

127
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,490
that we've played that several times we 
came,

128
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,880
we saw he died.
The fact that fact

129
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,450
that any human being would ever do that,
that.

130
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,430
And by the way,
the way he died,

131
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,830
that's some dark shit they watched and 
they stabbed him in the ass hole.

132
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,710
There's a video of him stabbing him in 
the asshole.

133
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I standing there just confused.
Not knowing what to do in this guys 

134
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,780
jamming a sword up his ass.
Have you seen the video?

135
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,980
I have not seen.
Oh my God,

136
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,120
it's awful.
You want to see,

137
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,480
you know,
the video,

138
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,940
them capturing him is fascinating 
because it's a guy who has lived with an

139
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,120
iron fist,
controlled these people.

140
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Been a brutal dictator.
Been a horrible monster of a human 

141
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,601
being.
Now all of a sudden these rebels have 

142
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:28,601
captured him and they can't believe they
have.

143
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:29,060
I mean,
they're shooting and stabbing him.

144
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:34,061
And then eventually they have his body 
and they prayed his body around after 

145
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,061
they've killed them.
But there's,

146
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,880
there's,
there's video of him should look at it 

147
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,141
for just for a moment because it's so 
stunning to see him captured and alive 

148
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,910
and can't believe that these rebels have
him.

149
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,370
That it's not even.
It's not even like,

150
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,510
yeah,
I have seen video of him captured and 

151
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,390
that look on his face.
So I know what you're talking about.

152
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,340
Just the guy's shoving.
But I did not.

153
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,790
I shoving a knife up his ass.
I um,

154
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,630
I hit a dog with my car awhile ago and I
just can't have no stomach for any of 

155
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:07,410
that stuff anymore.
I just a,

156
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,690
I don't,
something went,

157
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,450
ha ha.
I had a real breakdown.

158
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,790
Like we took it to the vet.
It lived.

159
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,500
I didn't hit,
I didn't.

160
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,750
So I hit it.
I hit a dog,

161
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,010
killed it a bout a year and a half ago.
He might have already been dead already 

162
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,310
been done because I think it was laying 
in the street because I didn't see it.

163
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,180
So it had to be already laying there 
anyways,

164
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:31,630
so it,
you know,

165
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I just.
And then I saw I was driving to my pot 

166
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,021
store and Eagle Rock and I saw this 
little black puppy dog run across the 

167
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,220
street in front of our car and there was
this big median,

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,950
like a grass median and it was good and 
I go,

169
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:45,730
stop,
stop.

170
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,940
And the cards hasn't started coming it 
the other way and I stopped saying my 

171
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,631
wife stops and I jumped out and I'm 
running and I see the cars coming and 

172
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:55,720
they're just,
I don't see the dog anymore.

173
00:07:55,721 --> 00:08:00,100
And then I see the dog next to the curb 
and it's Kinda like,

174
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:04,270
just going like that and it just crushed
me.

175
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:06,330
He's like,
even now to think of it switching.

176
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,990
Yes,
it got hit.

177
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,620
And so,
um,

178
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,300
we,
we pick it up and we,

179
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,200
we drove to a hospital as soon as we 
could.

180
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:14,680
I mean,
you know,

181
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,700
the Animal Hospital,
which there was one not far away and it 

182
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:19,870
lived,
the dog lived,

183
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:22,480
but I couldn't believe it.
You take it as a pet.

184
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,560
No,
no,

185
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:24,430
no,
no.

186
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,570
Um,
um,

187
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,380
they just might.
My wife called back,

188
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,940
you know,
to the thing and they said,

189
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:32,170
yeah,
it's going to live in.

190
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,210
We have someone who's going to take it 
like,

191
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,260
okay,
thank God.

192
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:39,260
But I was so surprised at how I just 
broke down over that puppy.

193
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:43,660
The dog I ran over,
I was like numb to but that dog for some

194
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,850
reason that just everything opened and I
was just,

195
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,060
I couldn't,
it was such a basket case puppy's so 

196
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,060
cute.
It was such,

197
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,790
I was hit by a car at such a how can.
So it's just like,

198
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:59,791
I see and I,
and I feel like I don't know if I have 

199
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,040
this,
but I feel like I have ptsd over that,

200
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:07,041
right.
Like I way over reacted to that 

201
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:07,560
situation so there was a lot more going 
on there.

202
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,080
And so when someone says something like 
the Kadafi video.

203
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,670
Yeah.
So I can't even imagine guys who have to

204
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,910
go to war and the stuff they have to see
and the things that they have to do.

205
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,060
I don't know how they all don't come.
You know,

206
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,840
anybody who went over there.
Yeah,

207
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,350
I,
I've been,

208
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,100
I've been to Afghanistan soldiers.
I mean,

209
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,340
but uh,
uh,

210
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,570
yeah.
I mean I'd known that.

211
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,450
Not Personally,
like they come to my show,

212
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:32,220
that kind of stuff.
I know those people.

213
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,730
I don't have a close friend who was 
actually in combat like that.

214
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,030
No.

215
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,290
I have a few close friends that have 
been in combat and when they start 

216
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,110
drinking and that's when,
you know,

217
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,890
inhibitions get loosened up and then 
stories start flowing and you know,

218
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,170
it's most people,
but it's not something people are 

219
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:52,330
designed to see,
you know,

220
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,290
especially not when.
No one else is seeing it.

221
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,310
The thing is if we all lived in the 
Roman times and everybody was getting 

222
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,740
sorted up every day and people getting 
hit with arrows all the time,

223
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,040
it's a normal part of life when people 
start accepting the fact that there's 

224
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,520
going to be lost,
but there's something about living today

225
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,670
where the majority of human beings live 
in this uber safe environment that's 

226
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,660
probably a safe more safe than any 
people who've ever lived ever.

227
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,220
And just overall in general,
like the modern Western civilization.

228
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,740
But then you're going over to 
Afghanistan and you're,

229
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:22,300
you're,
you know,

230
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,340
you're dealing with bombings and schools
and buses and sniper attacks and you 

231
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,711
know,
your buddy just lost a leg from an ied 

232
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:35,291
and you know,
that that kind of shit just wears on a 

233
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:35,291
person.

234
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:35,820
Yeah.
Just any,

235
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,690
any,
anything?

236
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,470
I.
Oh,

237
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I can't,
I can't believe we still do more like 

238
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,280
this.
It's just,

239
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,280
you know,
I'm very.

240
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,241
See I get it a lot of trouble because 
I've antiwar and all words are bullshit 

241
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,540
and get in trouble because you're 
antiwar.

242
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,770
For instance,
pro war,

243
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,620
uh,
the entire establishment is pro war.

244
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,840
You know that every,
every newscaster is pro war.

245
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,250
If you're on,
if you're not pro war,

246
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,580
you don't get on TV.
If you're against the war,

247
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,880
you get fired.
Like Phil Donahue,

248
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,920
like Ed Schultz,
like Jesse Ventura,

249
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,570
like Ashley Banfield,
fear.

250
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,750
If you tell Chris Hedges,
if you tell the truth about the war,

251
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,790
you will get fired from establishment 
news

252
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,500
establishment and use that will let you 
talk openly other than Artie.

253
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,200
Artie seems to be pretty open,
which is really ironic.

254
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,010
It's ironic,
right?

255
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,450
Yeah.
I mean,

256
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,700
when Abby Martin was working for,
it was like Jesus Christ,

257
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:22,340
like,
wow,

258
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,050
how's that work?

259
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,650
No.
At the empire files and you're working 

260
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,840
for Russia.
I know.

261
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,580
It does seem crazy.
It's a crazy,

262
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,210
crazy juxtaposition.
It is weird.

263
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:35,080
Ed Schultz was the one who said that,
uh,

264
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:36,020
you know,
he wasn't.

265
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,900
He was told what to cover,
what not to cover at MSNBC.

266
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,620
He was told not to cover Bernie Sanders.
He wanted to cover Bernie Sanders.

267
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:47,621
Anyway,
he said that the Hillary Clinton 

268
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:47,621
campaign and the head of NBC News,
Andy Lack.

269
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:50,240
We're joined at the hip and he tried to 
cover Bernie Sanders.

270
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,300
He was told not to,
he was yelled at by the head of MSNBC,

271
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,980
how he described it,
and a month later he was fired.

272
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,390
He was out.
Well,

273
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,690
Jack had a similar situation,
Jack from the young Turks,

274
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,460
just that he was told that,
uh,

275
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,680
our friends in Washington don't like 
your tone.

276
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,590
Oh my God,
that's what they told him.

277
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,800
That is hilarious.
And he was winning his time slot and 

278
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,720
they told them that and they moved into 
the weekend to give out sharp.

279
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,780
This is true,
this is true.

280
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,830
So they moved them to the weekend and 
they said they wanted him to work on his

281
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,780
presentation skills.
Guys.

282
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:24,400
Wedding is time.
Plot their segment.

283
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,860
We want you to work on your presentation
skills.

284
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,650
And meanwhile who they replaced them 
with Al Sharpton.

285
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,100
He's got great presentation skills.
That's all.

286
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:38,101
Al Has sued on Al Sharp.
Did you ever see him try to read a 

287
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,950
teleprompter is brutal.
Yeah.

288
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,020
I mean he's a great order,
but he's not a teleprompter reader and 

289
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,100
it was like I have clips we used to make
fun of all the time on my show.

290
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,110
If curious and then find out that that's
the reason they gave was because he's a 

291
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,060
better presenter.
He's better.

292
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,250
He's a great order.
That's different than being a news 

293
00:12:59,250 --> 00:12:59,630
presenter and that is not in Al 
Sharpton's wheelhouse.

294
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,890
No,
it's just he's not the most trustworthy 

295
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:04,890
person either.

296
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,380
I mean he's got a history of deception.
So you having that,

297
00:13:06,381 --> 00:13:07,720
the way he got that job?
Yeah.

298
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,870
Well how about the way he became famous,
the Tawana Brawley case.

299
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,430
I mean he became famous through 
deception and so you're seeing this guy 

300
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,580
who is basically a famous con man who's 
now on television on a news program.

301
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,800
Well,
they have.

302
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,510
There's a lot.
Look at Brian Williams.

303
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,170
Yes,
yes.

304
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,140
He has the 11th hour at an MSNBC,
so since everybody forgotten,

305
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,010
everybody has forgotten.
I got.

306
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,330
His punishment was he had to.
He had to go spend six months a giggling

307
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,450
with Rachel maddow.
What did he do?

308
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,730
Something show.
They do these shows.

309
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:47,731
They have like these round tables.
At the end he has to laugh and pretend 

310
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:48,370
they all pretend they fucked up about 
him.

311
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,890
All he had to do is tell the truth and I
was scary enough.

312
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,460
No Shit.
I mean,

313
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,100
you were in Iraq.
He really were there.

314
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,270
Were there?
Yeah.

315
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,260
I mean,
you really were there.

316
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:58,210
Or Afghanistan.
Was it Iraq or Afghanistan?

317
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,610
I think it was a wreck.
And you're really.

318
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,780
Shots were fired.
Hillary did the same goddamn thing.

319
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:05,380
Oh,
that's right.

320
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,810
She lied about being shot at fucking 
straight up.

321
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,740
Lied about being in Bosnia.
Right.

322
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,150
And,
and who was it?

323
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,370
The was the comedian who outed her.
It was a sinbad.

324
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,780
Sinbad who was on that trip and he's 
like sniper.

325
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,030
Oh,
that's hilarious.

326
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,220
Yeah.
She was busted straight up,

327
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,520
lying about being shot at.
So it's just,

328
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,530
it's always shocking to me when I find 
out it had.

329
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:33,030
Politicians are lying.
Isn't it so true?

330
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,660
They're all dark.
That's weird.

331
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,130
It's,
it's such a.

332
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,100
only the purest of people are drawn to 
that,

333
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:44,101
but freshman,
it's whenever I find out they're 

334
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:44,101
narcissists.

335
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:44,101
Megaliters,
narcissistic megalomaniacs.

336
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm always shocked.
You know what it is,

337
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:50,401
Jimmy?
We're weeding out the bad apples and 

338
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:50,500
then we're eventually gonna get to the 
good ones.

339
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,530
Yeah.
We got to get rid of these bad ones 

340
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,281
first.
So that's why it comes back to when he 

341
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:57,281
was talking about how Putin,
he is like,

342
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:57,281
Hey,
I want to tell trump,

343
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:58,010
slow down.
Don't be friends with this guy.

344
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,040
No,
I want trump to be friends with Putin 

345
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,040
because he's a nuclear power.
I want trump to be friends with anybody.

346
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,590
We need detente.
NATO is the one wrapping up tensions,

347
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,520
ramping up tensions with Russia and we 
have ever since the Cold War,

348
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:13,940
it supposedly ended and so it was just a
few anyways.

349
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,770
So I just think,
yes,

350
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,960
Putin has a bad guy.
They're all bad guys.

351
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,250
Right?
There's why I,

352
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,200
you know,
I just had John Kiriakou on my show.

353
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:21,690
I don't know,
is he?

354
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,520
So he is a FCA guy.
He went to prison because he exposed the

355
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:27,520
torture program.
Oh yeah.

356
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,350
So Robert Mueller actually prosecuted 
that guy.

357
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,520
So now he's,
he's a member of veterans intelligence 

358
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:36,520
professionals for sanity,
Vips.

359
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,340
And they were,
uh,

360
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,060
they were invented or they were 
originally organized to debunk the 

361
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,081
weapons of mass destruction about Iraq.
So they were intelligence professionals 

362
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:51,011
who knew what was happening that we're 
being sold a bill of goods because the 

363
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:51,710
military industrial complex wanted it's 
war.

364
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,760
Right.
And so they,

365
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,460
they were like all the top guys,
ray mcgovern,

366
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:56,720
Bill Binney,
and they,

367
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,110
and they created this organization to 
help debunk.

368
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:05,111
It will open.
He is the guy who was the first whistle 

369
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:05,111
blower for the NSF.
Correct.

370
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:06,890
And they tried to throw in the FBI,
tried to throw him in jail.

371
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,140
And of course he's the smartest guy at 
the NSA of her head.

372
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,840
So he outsmarted the FBI.
Well how did they do that?

373
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,910
So he had the story,
but I forget the story,

374
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:17,630
he told it to me,
but he had them secretly recorded saying

375
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:22,631
certain things.
And so when they tried to show the 

376
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:22,910
evidence against him,
he was like,

377
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:24,680
actually I got you guys.
And they're like,

378
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,460
oh shit.
And so they could.

379
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,480
So he had him.
So he outsmarted them and he tells the 

380
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,480
story on my show and you know,
it was about a year ago,

381
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,801
so I don't remember exactly how it went.
But he told me a lot of mindblowing 

382
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:36,980
stuff on my show,
a lot of stuff just to,

383
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,720
um,
you know,

384
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,400
like about how they spy on us.
Well,

385
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:45,401
he was the one that first expose this 
program that was essentially spying on 

386
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:46,520
every single email,
every single voicemail,

387
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,130
every single conversation that you have 
is being recorded.

388
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,740
So William Binney invented a thing 
called thin thread.

389
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:57,070
So thin thread was a data collection.
So what he did is he hooked up every 

390
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,680
cell phone to every cell phone in the,
in the universe.

391
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,710
It's,
and he did it and it was hard to do and 

392
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:05,710
everybody said you couldn't do it.
He did it.

393
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:10,130
And so he knew that medidata.
What was more predictive than say,

394
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:13,250
if I tap your phone and listen to your 
actual phone conversation,

395
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,300
that I actually learned more by looking 
at a larger data set.

396
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,040
And when,
when,

397
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,170
when context start happening,
that means movements happening.

398
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,430
That means that attack is going to 
happen.

399
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,950
That means more so if the metadata means
more.

400
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,210
And so he found a way to attract people 
and keep your identity secret.

401
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,010
So it was constitutional.
That's what he cared about,

402
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:39,011
the constitution and the right to 
privacy and thin thread did that it was 

403
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:42,941
a better and,
and they got rid of thin thread and a 

404
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:42,941
couple of weeks later,
nine slash 11 happened.

405
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,710
So that's what built.
So that's who bill binney is.

406
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:50,711
And so he said they got rid of it 
because there's billions of dollars in 

407
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:50,711
the do pro.
They brought in a,

408
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:51,710
a,
uh,

409
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,410
I think it was called trailblazer out 
and not as good as a tracker,

410
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,740
not as good as a metadata thing and,
but it was five,

411
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:01,560
$6,000,000,000
to Booz Allen or whoever invented it.

412
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,800
And that's what it's all about is it's 
all about money and you don't want to 

413
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,740
disappoint people who want to have a lot
of money paid their way.

414
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,030
And then.
So that's what.

415
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:14,031
So he blew the whistle on that and they 
come back at them and they tried to put 

416
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:14,250
him in jail.
That's what they do to whistleblowers.

417
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,080
That's what we do.
So that's funny to hear him say,

418
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,200
oh,
somebody wrote a bad book about Putin 

419
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,200
and they ended up dead.

420
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,350
What do you think we do in this country?
Look what they did to Chelsea manning.

421
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,470
Look what we did to people who expose 
war crimes inside of our country right 

422
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:27,470
now.
We're trying.

423
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,380
They're trying to assassinate Juliana 
sons.

424
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,930
They haven't been basically solitary 
confinement.

425
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,450
We literally did torture Chelsea 
Manning.

426
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,770
So,
uh,

427
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,450
and then,
you know,

428
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,420
Barack Obama used,
uh,

429
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,090
he,
he prosecuted lots of whistleblowing 

430
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,200
journalists using the non.
Blanking on the word it's called,

431
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,330
but,
um,

432
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,710
espionage act.
So this idea that,

433
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,030
yeah,
I'm sure poor,

434
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:54,060
maybe Putin didn't.
Maybe that woman who wrote that book 

435
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,060
about Putin has a lot of powerful 
enemies.

436
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,880
Usually you do when you are that kind of
been a journalist where you're exposing 

437
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,120
the powerful.
She probably didn't just expose booton.

438
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,540
So she probably exposed a lot of people.
My point being is that,

439
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,110
uh,
you know,

440
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,400
now who's being naive gay?

441
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Well,
I mean she probably did expose a lot of 

442
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,911
people,
but it's also very likely that Putin 

443
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:13,911
enter.
Yes.

444
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:17,960
And I'm not,
I'm not denying that Barack Obama had a 

445
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,600
kill list.
So these guys are out,

446
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,110
you know,
he,

447
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,510
he took us from two hours to seven.
He did Libya,

448
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:25,240
turned it into a failed state.
Right now they have open slave trading.

449
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,820
No,
you're watching on youtube.

450
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,220
So dark.
And they wanted to do it again.

451
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:30,510
They want to do it in Syria.
They want.

452
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,220
So Joe,
let me ask you a question.

453
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,220
If we get rid of Assad in Syria,
do you know who takes over?

454
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,290
Uh,
the Jesus?

455
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,070
That's right.

456
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,730
Who starts running things,
Moses,

457
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,310
Elka,
al Qaeda,

458
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:45,670
El Nuestra.
Yeah.

459
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Uh,
so that the power vacuum that always 

460
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:50,980
happens.
The,

461
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:50,980
uh,
the,

462
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,730
the Wahhabi terrorist funded by Saudi 
Arabia,

463
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,760
that's who takes over and I have video 
tape after videotape of our top 

464
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,171
officials admitting that Saudi Arabia 
Funds Isis and that we also did so and 

465
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,550
that we created,
we created al Qaeda,

466
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,790
we got,
we create an isis was created because of

467
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,791
our invasion of Iraq,
but then we actually fund them and we 

468
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,170
ship them arms.
So for what reason?

469
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,230
To overthrow aside.
So we can put a pipeline through Syria.

470
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,440
So we fund them so that they fight 
Assad.

471
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,830
But then Saudi Arabia funds,
this isn't the first time we did that.

472
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:28,440
We funded to Al Ida.
So they would fight the Russians.

473
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,940
Right.
So this is the same.

474
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,130
And then we were left with them.
When was the mujahideen?

475
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,180
That's when they were the moon.

476
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,770
Yes.
Hi Dean.

477
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,040
So,
and I have videotapes of Hillary Clinton

478
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,190
screaming about this.
We created this problem.

479
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,170
She says this on video.
I have it.

480
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,150
So,
um,

481
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,940
that's why I get trouble because I tell 
the truth about the war.

482
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,240
And if you tell the truth about the war,
you'll be called a conspiracy theorist 

483
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,550
by the establishment news.
That's exactly what's happened.

484
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,440
That happened to me.
Or you conspiracy theorist?

485
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,970
No,
that's what they say.

486
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,970
You know what the biggest,
because I tell the truth about Syria,

487
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,050
right?
Uh,

488
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,540
the biggest conspiracy in my lifetime 
was the Iraq war.

489
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,410
That was a conspiracy.

490
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,380
Yeah.
That's legit.

491
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,900
That's a legit conspiracy.
Yeah.

492
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,830
I mean that's when you can actually 
prove right.

493
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,380
I mean I used to have a whole bit about 
it.

494
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,670
I used to have a whole bit about like 
the,

495
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,910
the only way to find out if someone was 
like from 2005,

496
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,000
it was that the reason why they put 
George Bush and power is the only way to

497
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:26,001
find out if someone is really stupid is 
to put an actual stupid guy in his 

498
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:30,411
president and find out if everybody 
freaks out because the only way to 

499
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:30,411
really tell.
And we're like,

500
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,190
well we could put a smart guy in there 
and have Mac.

501
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm like,
no,

502
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:32,910
no,
no.

503
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,890
We'll never know.
We'll never know.

504
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,240
We'll get it.
We get a dumb guy.

505
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,010
Let's just try it out and see what 
happens.

506
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,770
And then it was all the whole thing 
about us going to war in Iraq.

507
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:42,870
Like why did we go to the war over there
and why?

508
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,800
What did we tell them?
And they bought that Holy Shit.

509
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,670
And then he won again.
He won again.

510
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,440
Fuck.
And then I go and you know,

511
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,820
there's someone in the back of the room 
going,

512
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,040
I think we can go dumber.

513
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,940
And that became trump.
I mean,

514
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:06,780
that was from 2005 from my showtime 
special from 13 years ago.

515
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,110
Uh,
let me tell you something,

516
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:14,111
trump,
it will be allowed to be president and 

517
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:15,260
was allowed to be president because he's
doing the bidding of the establishment.

518
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,170
They're on board with most of the stuff 
he's doing there like that.

519
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,490
He's,
he's not,

520
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,950
he's not pulling back on any of the 
wars.

521
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:26,951
He's,
they've all ramped up the military 

522
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:28,541
budget.
Isn't it funny Joe not protecting him 

523
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:28,541
from you or they're not protecting him 
from this,

524
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,510
this investigation?
Well,

525
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,680
he's.
Nothing's happened.

526
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,000
Again,
it's,

527
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,050
and by the way,
what they've gotten them on is all 

528
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,050
regular corruption.
Like I said,

529
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,050
trump is corrupt.
Yes,

530
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,320
he's corrupt.
He's corrupt with Saudi Arabia.

531
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:41,720
He's corrupt with Russia.
He grew up with Israel.

532
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,860
He's get,
they're all corrupt,

533
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,790
but he thought the Clinton Foundation 
and they're there all the chomsky quote,

534
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,780
they'd all be hung if we applied the 
Nuremberg standards.

535
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,200
So this is the world we're living in.

536
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,030
So this idea that somehow we need to 
focus extra on trump and somehow poot.

537
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,860
And you know what,
journalists,

538
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,200
the Anti Putin journalists in Russia 
will tell you that we're a bunch of 

539
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,870
numbskulls over here because we're 
inflating Putin's power.

540
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,110
So we are blood like he's this all 
powerful guy who's got his finger in 

541
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,741
every decision everywhere at all times.
Ellison mulattoes now blaming the Green 

542
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,350
party being controlled by the Russians 
for an Ohio election.

543
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:19,640
A special election.
I'm not kidding.

544
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:24,290
I could show you some Milana and I.
Who Doesn't love Alyssa Milano,

545
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,370
right?
She's beautiful.

546
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,170
She's one of the prettiest of all time.

547
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,290
I met her in a hotel once.
Did you really wandering through the 

548
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:32,290
hotel.
We got an elevator together.

549
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,820
So here is can't believe him in a hotel 
elevator with just not as I said hello.

550
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,930
She said hello back.
And that was it.

551
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,840
Did she know who you were?
I don't think so.

552
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,270
No.
This is a long time ago too.

553
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,680
She says,
you know what sucks,

554
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:49,681
because of our unwillingness to pass 
policy that protects our election 

555
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:53,231
integrity.
I immediately think the Green party 

556
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:53,420
votes.
And tonight's our Russian meddling.

557
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,660
Why else would eddie would cast a 
protest vote in Ohio when there's so 

558
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,900
much at stake?
So much at stake.

559
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,540
That's so delusional.
What is it?

560
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,190
Protest vote.
What's your vote worth?

561
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,100
If everyone votes and they all vote 
green,

562
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,580
is that a protest vote?
If it is possible that the Green party 

563
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:11,800
can win,
like do you have no faith?

564
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,840
So what they're doing is essentially 
just bowing down to a rig system saying 

565
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,240
the system is rigged,
so just vote for side b,

566
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,360
even though side a and b are funded by 
the same people I know,

567
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:25,240
I know,
but ideologically side B is our side.

568
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,560
That's what she's saying.

569
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,570
So what they've gone past.
So now the hashtag resistance have gone 

570
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,261
beyond voters shaming and now what 
they're actually doing is democracy 

571
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:38,861
shaming.
You don't get to participate in 

572
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:38,861
democracy and those people.
So let me tell you something.

573
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:39,440
When people say,
Oh,

574
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,910
you know,
the Greens take away vote.

575
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I would not have voted in the 
presidential election if I did not have 

576
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,300
the opportunity to vote for the Green 
Party.

577
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,570
Just so those votes,
you don't own those votes.

578
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:54,710
The way electoral politics works is that
if you don't have enough votes to win,

579
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,100
you have to go get them and you have to 
appeal to those votes,

580
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:01,430
but they don't have an appeal to voters.
The Democratic Party,

581
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:06,431
they have nothing,
and so what they have left is fear and 

582
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:08,540
voter shaming and that's it.
Now they're actually shaming democracy.

583
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,620
Well,
you would also think that by the time 

584
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:13,620
after we've gotten through this past 
election where no one,

585
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,430
literally no one in the mainstream 
media,

586
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,680
then maybe Fox News predicted that trump
was gonna win,

587
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,950
no one.
They all were 100 percent sure hillary 

588
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,950
was gonna win.
They were.

589
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,230
They were had in the 90 percent range of
probability of her winning and they were

590
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,870
displaying it on cnn so they know that 
that's wrong.

591
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,670
So why would someone think that a Green 
party candidate has to be,

592
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:37,030
or a libertarian candidate has to be a 
protest vote?

593
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,630
Why can't it be a real vote at this 
point when you're talking about the kind

594
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:45,631
of social media outreach that is capable
today that's possible today,

595
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,610
what you a person who has some really 
good points,

596
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,860
and as I look at this woman who wanted 
in New York,

597
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,080
the 28 year old girls a democratic 
socialist,

598
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,660
Alessandra ocozzio plant says,
look,

599
00:25:55,661 --> 00:26:00,661
if that doesn't tell you like this world
is changing in a radical way and 

600
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:04,950
upstarts and and,
and people who are huge underdogs have 

601
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,160
the possibility of winning.
It's not a protest vote.

602
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,310
It's an actual vote.
And if everybody who thinks this way 

603
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,830
votes towards that protest vote,
guess what?

604
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,270
They win.
That's right.

605
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,960
That's what it is.

606
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,890
So I used to have a joke or I would say,
no,

607
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:20,460
you can't vote for.
You can vote for a third party candidate

608
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:23,010
until a lot of people already voting for
a third party candidate.

609
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,500
Exactly.
That's what they're saying.

610
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,000
You can't vote for.
They have no chance to win.

611
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:32,001
So you have to wait until a lot of 
people are already so that people don't 

612
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:32,550
understand that inherent contradiction.
And by the way,

613
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,820
people maybe if you spent a 10th of the 
energy trying to excite the half of the 

614
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:43,521
country that doesn't vote as you do and 
trying to voter shame progressive's or 

615
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,980
Green Party or environmentalist for not 
giving you their vote,

616
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:51,981
what you do not fucking own,
you would've spent a 10th of the energy 

617
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:54,360
trying to excite people who don't 
participate to participate.

618
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,610
Instead of shaming the people who do 
participate.

619
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,930
Maybe you'd get somewhere.

620
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,300
It's also this reluctance to admit that 
both sides are corrupt,

621
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,330
is this very strange thing that exists 
on people who operate within those 

622
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,891
narrow bandwidth.
In this narrow bandwidth is whatever 

623
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:14,491
side you're on,
whether it's you're on the right or the 

624
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:16,141
left,
this is the side that you want to win 

625
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:16,600
and it's the right side and they're the 
good people and the other side,

626
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,200
even though,
well,

627
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:20,920
even though our side does wrong,
this side does worse and they operate in

628
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:25,921
this real narrow bandwidth.
This is why she would think something 

629
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:29,440
that's possibly negative for her side is
a protest vote.

630
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,140
Instead of being your actual feelings on
the issue,

631
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,220
and if these people really cared about 
voting integrity,

632
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:41,221
wouldn't they want paper ballots?
If they really cared about a voter 

633
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:44,851
integrity,
wouldn't they want rank choice voting 

634
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:44,851
when they want that?
Then you don't,

635
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:48,921
you don't,
you don't have to worry about this 

636
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:48,921
choice voting choice.
So they have it in Maine now,

637
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:48,921
right?
So,

638
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:49,690
uh,
it's where,

639
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:49,930
so,
you know,

640
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,160
you,
you get to,

641
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,400
this is my first choice.
This is my second choice.

642
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,580
This is my third choice.
So you don't get to.

643
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,010
So it eliminates that.
You're a spoiler,

644
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,300
right?
It's just.

645
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,260
Yeah.
So,

646
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,340
um,
and,

647
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:08,341
and they voted in,
in Maine and the politicians of course 

648
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:12,661
don't want it.
So they got rid of it and the court 

649
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:12,661
reinstated.
It hadn't been.

650
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,690
I think it's happened twice.
Now.

651
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,380
How does it work

652
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,750
in terms of like say if you're going to 
vote for a governor of Maine,

653
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,090
you have a first choice.
A second choice.

654
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,450
Okay.
Let's say,

655
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,540
let's say there's three choices.
So you get to,

656
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,010
you get to say,
well,

657
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,070
let's say,
let's say if your first choice was a 

658
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,070
green party candidate and you go,
okay,

659
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,131
that's my first choice,
but my second choice would be the 

660
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,081
Democrat.
So in my third choice would be maybe 

661
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,410
nobody.
And so does second choice have different

662
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:36,360
points.
So if you that,

663
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,920
if your first choice doesn't get enough 
votes to win,

664
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,870
then your second choice goes,
right?

665
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,020
So that's how it works.
So you're never wasting your vote.

666
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,690
And you know,
what's ironic is that,

667
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,920
and I might have,
you know,

668
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,830
there's people who can better explain 
that simply.

669
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,400
I know people are going be jamie the 
weighty,

670
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,620
better way to say that I,
I'm sure there's better ways,

671
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,860
but the thing that kills me is that 
Bernie Sanders,

672
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,670
his whole career was about being an 
independent.

673
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,010
And I have video tapes of him saying,
you know,

674
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:03,750
what kills me.
This is like,

675
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,040
what do I do?
These talks that I talk to people,

676
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,600
they come up to me after these debates 
and they said,

677
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:09,860
you know,
I like what you said and uh,

678
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,110
you,
you make the most sense.

679
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,120
But I can't vote for you because you 
never going to win.

680
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,980
I hate that they go,
I want to waste my vote.

681
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Oh,
if there's one thing I hate more than 

682
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,040
that phrase,
waste your vote.

683
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,230
This was what he was saying his entire 
career until now.

684
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,820
And I want to know why.
I want to know what the hell does Bernie

685
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,540
Sanders in 2018 know that Bernie Sanders
in 2006 didn't know.

686
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,530
And Bernie Sanders in 1996 doesn't know.
And he tells everybody you got to run.

687
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,360
He's,
you know,

688
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,350
getting people to come into the 
Democratic Party,

689
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:42,100
which is actively cheating them yet he's
still seeing and him.

690
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,680
And he still runs as an independent in 
Maine.

691
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,840
I mean in Vermont.
He still runs it.

692
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,990
Everybody say you guy,
you can see he gets to run as an 

693
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:51,990
independent.

694
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,550
He gets the running as an independent 
while represented.

695
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:54,240
Democratic Party.
Yes.

696
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,270
So they have a special sweetheart deal 
is.

697
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:59,900
What is he saying when he says,
he's saying now that protest votes are a

698
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,280
waste.
Like what is he saying?

699
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,390
He told everybody vote for Hillary.
He told.

700
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:08,410
I mean,
he's not starting a third party and you 

701
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:08,410
know,
his whole life,

702
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,991
he was like,
he said that we have to have the 

703
00:30:11,991 --> 00:30:13,470
verbiage he used.
One time I saw him was that,

704
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,710
uh,
you know,

705
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:15,810
uh,
Jesse Jackson's correct.

706
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:17,730
We knew we needed a rainbow coalition of
people,

707
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,180
uh,
but it has to happen outside of the 

708
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,370
Democratic Party.
He said that that was him.

709
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,800
So we have to have a progressive 
coalition,

710
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:28,320
but it has to happen outside and who 
better to lead it.

711
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,050
But Bernie Sanders.
So that's why it's hard to start a third

712
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:35,940
party because you need people who are 
already famous and popular and,

713
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,840
uh,
in government.

714
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:41,841
So if he left and he got saved,
Tulsi Gabbert and Nina Turner and 

715
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,800
Alexandra Cause your court.
And he got a bunch of people that are 

716
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,201
super popular on the left,
we'd have a third party and that would 

717
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:48,330
be pulling at 10,
15 percent.

718
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:53,330
And now the Democrats would have to join
former coalition instead of what they're

719
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:55,710
doing now,
which is ignoring progressives.

720
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:01,070
After she cheated Bernie Sanders,
after the Democrats cheated Bernie 

721
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,150
Sanders in the primary,
Hillary Clinton didn't choose Bernie 

722
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,150
Sanders as their vice president,
as an olive branch.

723
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,510
Doesn't choose a little bit with worn as
an olive branch.

724
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,660
She went to her right.
She got Tim Kaine was to the right of 

725
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,180
her.
Who's anti union,

726
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:12,440
whose.
Oh,

727
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,940
everything bad thing you want in the 
Corporate Democrat,

728
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,380
he's pro walled.
The whole deal.

729
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,710
She went.
So just so if we had a third party that 

730
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,610
actually pulled at 10 or 15 percent,
they would have to.

731
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,850
They couldn't do that anymore.
They'd have to.

732
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,320
They'd have to do a thing called Joe 
voter outreach instead of voters shaming

733
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,350
or it's what it's devolved to now,
which is democracy shaming.

734
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,190
They're literally shaming people for 
participating in democracy.

735
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,280
You don't get to participate in 
democracy because you're a third party 

736
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,920
will fuck you.
That's called democracy.

737
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,480
And so yes,
I do.

738
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,630
And I get to vote my conscience.
It will be right back.

739
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,130
That's good.
That's good.

740
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,180
That break right there.
Solid going a radio show,

741
00:31:51,181 --> 00:31:53,040
that will be the way to go.
Hey,

742
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:58,041
one of the reasons why we came in today 
is because we wanted to talk about the 

743
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,350
Alex Jones situation.
Um,

744
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:01,410
I know you were a notch as a vocal 
critic of Alex Jones.

745
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:03,960
You spit in his face on,
on live Internet show.

746
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:07,290
I did not spit in his face.
That was completely involuntary.

747
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,070
He coughed and liquid came out of your 
mouth.

748
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,230
As you know,
Alex Jones is hilarious.

749
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,910
There's no doubt.
There's no denying that.

750
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,030
He's occasionally very hilarious.
Yes.

751
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,100
Yeah.
And I told you what happened.

752
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:21,330
I was walking up.
He's having this,

753
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:23,280
they're just about to go fisticuffs the 
whole time.

754
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,830
And as I walk up he goes,
Hey,

755
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:27,810
I'm just trying to be nice and you had 
to spit.

756
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,050
And I had a mouthful iced tea and I 
understand that's my story.

757
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm sticking to it.
Good story.

758
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,120
You know who trump meant to say would I 
would actually say would.

759
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:39,700
Yeah.

760
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,080
Yeah.
He actually,

761
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,870
what did he say?
I don't see any reason why they would,

762
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:46,760
but he meant to say what it's.
Yeah.

763
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That was one of the worst lies I think 
anybody's ever told on television in 

764
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,630
front of millions of people.
That was a disturbing lie because in the

765
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:56,030
context of the words and the way he was 
communicating,

766
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:58,730
it's very clear.
It's very clear.

767
00:32:58,731 --> 00:32:59,650
He meant to say what

768
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,030
it meant.
It was disconcerting to me for different

769
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:08,031
reasons.
It was disconcerting to me because it 

770
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:08,031
showed that he

771
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:08,031
mcadam to cave.
Yeah.

772
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:08,860
Someone talked to him.
Someone pulled them aside and said,

773
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,870
do you understand what the fuck is going
on here?

774
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,190
By the way,
when they go,

775
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:12,710
oh,
he did.

776
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,400
He,
uh,

777
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:18,010
trump contradicted our intelligence 
communities in public in Helsinki,

778
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,410
and that's treason.
No ass wipe.

779
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,430
That's not treason.
The president sets our foreign policy.

780
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,740
You're not supposed to contradict the 
fucking president.

781
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Whatever the president says goes,
and I hate fucking saying this because 

782
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,990
I'm not a fan of Donald trump,
but God damn it,

783
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,070
we all lose our head and think that the 
unelected spies run our foreign policy.

784
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,670
They do not spice spice or spice 
unelected.

785
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,230
Yeah.
So,

786
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,500
and the ones who let us into Iraq,
let's not forget that the very.

787
00:33:47,501 --> 00:33:49,300
Do Anyway,
don't.

788
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,330
Do you ever play that video?
I played almost weekly on my show of 

789
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,151
Robert Molar lying about weapons of mass
destruction to Congress to get us into 

790
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:57,151
the Iraq war.

791
00:33:57,151 --> 00:34:00,330
Well,
he was misinformed at the time.

792
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:05,630
He wasn't aware of all the information 
and you know him along with Colin Powell

793
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,070
and many others where they're just good 
guys,

794
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,280
good people,
good people to do it in a bad.

795
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:16,281
Those those no bid contracts at 
Halliburton got for billions and 

796
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:20,990
billions of dollars.
It's just because they were the right 

797
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:20,990
ones for the job.
I mean,

798
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,511
why have bids when you've got 
Halliburton and you've got a guy who's 

799
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,140
really close to Halliburton and Dick 
Cheney,

800
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,350
who used to be the CEO of Halliburton as
the vice president.

801
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,400
He got a sweet deal here.
Take advantage of it.

802
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,790
Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a 
$30,000,000

803
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:37,570
down payment when he became vice 
president of this little bit of that.

804
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Trying to help you out.
I know you like to go duck hunting,

805
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,340
give you a nice gun.
Don't shoot your friend in the face.

806
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:47,790
That's how I used to do a bit about that
too.

807
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,190
He shot his friend in the face and his 
friend,

808
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:51,690
apologize,
apologize.

809
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,030
That's how gangster Dick Cheney is.
Ah,

810
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:59,031
I should've been there or I looked like 
a bird thing was so fucking crazy,

811
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,910
you know?
Um,

812
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,460
we were talking about Alex Jones being 
the platform.

813
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:06,390
Yeah,
I mean,

814
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,620
it seems to be across the board,
like they're,

815
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:16,790
it's almost waited for apple.
It seems like when apple pulled them 

816
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,450
from itunes,
then,

817
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,800
you know,
youtube,

818
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:20,820
uh,
danced with it,

819
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:22,530
right?
They'd given him some strikes.

820
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,830
It was really recently,
like within the last couple of that 

821
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,310
facebook had given him some strikes and 
Youtube gave him some strikes and people

822
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:30,840
are like,
hey,

823
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,770
you know,
there was some,

824
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,840
I felt like almost like unfounded,
um,

825
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,370
speculation

826
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,230
that they would remove him from the 
platform.

827
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,990
My 10 navigant or move him.
That's crazy.

828
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,630
That's too far.
And then all of a sudden,

829
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,240
boom,
everybody in one fell swoop.

830
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,310
Spotify,
spotify remove him.

831
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,690
They were going to,
they did.

832
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,470
Itunes removed him.
But there's a loophole though that some 

833
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,110
of you.
I saw an article today where people want

834
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,610
nothing less than total destruction.
Uh,

835
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,160
I,
that apple,

836
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,560
uh,
attacked Alex Jones and got rid of them,

837
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:09,480
but they offered him a safety net in the
form of the APP that he has on their APP

838
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,730
store that they're still.
So they were trying to take that down to

839
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:16,731
like take down his,
his show became instantly way more 

840
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:16,731
popular.
Oh,

841
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:16,731
I'm sure.
So it can.

842
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:20,480
The unintended consequences.
I try to tell people that,

843
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:20,850
uh,
you know,

844
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,430
I'm not defending Alex Jones.
I'm defending,

845
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,370
you know,
the principle of freedom of speech.

846
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,740
You know,
people who are convicted of killers or.

847
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:29,850
No,
on death row,

848
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,630
they still get their freedom of speech.
You're allowed to print articles and 

849
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:35,630
they're allowed to have,
you know what I mean?

850
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:35,630
They're still allowed to.
Oh,

851
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,780
he's allowed to still.
I mean,

852
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:38,520
he does.
He's hasn't been silenced.

853
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:43,521
He has his website,
but he could put his show out on his 

854
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:43,521
website.
He can,

855
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:45,120
he can host it from his website and it 
could all be fine,

856
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:50,330
but these major media companies now,
they just decided we've had enough.

857
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,160
We don't want this on,
and here's the thing,

858
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:58,161
like,
I don't know what he said that they 

859
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:02,140
were,
there was the straw that broke the 

860
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,801
camel's back.
It seemed like it's not a recent 

861
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:03,900
statement that says go to the court 
transcripts and we'll figure out.

862
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,860
Oh,
there wasn't.

863
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,390
There wasn't a,
Oh,

864
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,790
there is no hearing or nothing.

865
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,230
There wasn't a judicial hearing.
There was no.

866
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,410
Come on.
Do they just want,

867
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,390
they let some Jag off billionaire in the
middle of the night on a whim,

868
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:16,790
fucking do this.
Is that what happened?

869
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:21,950
Do you think that's what it is?
That was some billionaire or do you 

870
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,531
think it's the middle managers and the 
executives at all these giant tech 

871
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:28,000
companies have just decided?
Um,

872
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,400
I don't know.
It's,

873
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,260
it's definitely,
uh,

874
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,980
the government tells facebook,
uh,

875
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,520
what to do a lot of times.
Right.

876
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:40,521
And so they bow to the government all 
the time because they don't want to be 

877
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:40,521
regulated.
So,

878
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:41,700
uh,
that's why they just,

879
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:44,520
they just started having hearings with.
That's why they had those hearings.

880
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:47,370
Should we regulate facebook?
So those hearings,

881
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:49,770
by the way,
we're fucking bizarre.

882
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,400
It was like a guy pretending to be 
human,

883
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,840
you know,
it's like some sort of a robot or an 

884
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,931
alien the way you would sip water.
He would take like this and it was like 

885
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,080
a guy spitting dip into a glass.
He would go to.

886
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:10,390
It was the weirdest little sips.
Someone should make a compilation of 

887
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,710
Zuckerberg,
sips of water.

888
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,610
Whoever is that guy who makes their 
compilations of your show.

889
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:19,611
He does a good job as a funny job by 
those Zuckerberg or pressure.

890
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,890
No senator.
No Sir.

891
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,550
There.
Watch this.

892
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,780
Watch that.
Sip.

893
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,280
Give me another one of those.
Oh,

894
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:30,590
there is one.
They have them.

895
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:31,100
Yeah.
Oh,

896
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:36,190
so there is a tricky water.
Oh my God.

897
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,340
Watch them sip who fucking sips water 
like that.

898
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,940
It's like he has to think about it.
Act Normal.

899
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,950
Be Human.
Humans drink water,

900
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,190
drink the water.
Slowly he tilted that glass at him and 

901
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,190
the guy behind him at the same colored 
tie.

902
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,360
That's the guy that they're going to 
shoot in the head keeping eye contact 

903
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,921
while he was drinking the water.
It's kind of weird trying to at least be

904
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,160
disrespectful.
Fantastic.

905
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,920
That,
that whole thing was so strange.

906
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,490
It was so what a better guy to,
uh,

907
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,200
to,
to protect us from fake news and tell us

908
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:15,190
what's real news and you know,
who has integrity and what doesn't.

909
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:20,191
Then a guy who made a couple of billion 
dollars off a stolen idea from his 

910
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:20,191
friends.
I mean,

911
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:20,980
I think that's the perfect guy to say 
that.

912
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,450
The true story.
Is that what he actually did he,

913
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,420
I think that's what was in the movie,
right?

914
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,830
That was in the movie.
That's what I know.

915
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,360
I didn't see the movie.
Oh,

916
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:29,130
okay.
Yeah,

917
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,260
I know the story though was that he 
ripped people off that it wasn't his 

918
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,050
idea,
but he was the one who figured out a way

919
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:40,051
to wrestle at a get rich as fuck.
But this is Matt Taibbi wrote an article

920
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,100
on this second,
August second about this and um,

921
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,620
there's been a lot of people being 
platform from facebook that you don't 

922
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:52,620
know about.
Like,

923
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,150
this isn't like,
uh,

924
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,940
okay.
So,

925
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:56,170
um,
here's,

926
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,230
here's what he's,
they shut down lots of other sites at 

927
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,940
the behest of the government in Israel,
like the,

928
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,440
and the Atlantic Council.
So pages like black elevation,

929
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,830
they got shut down a page called mindful
being.

930
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,980
They got shut down.
A facebook also wiped out,

931
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:15,850
no unite the right to it,
which is a page appearing to advertise a

932
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:20,851
counter rally on the upcoming 
anniversary of the violence in 

933
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:20,851
Charlottesville.

934
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,470
So they shut that down to Matt,
how you beat it.

935
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,820
Let me just give you a quick quote from 
his article.

936
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,120
He says,
facebook was helped in its efforts to 

937
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,881
wipe out these dangerous memes by the 
Atlantic Council on whose board you'll 

938
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:34,600
find confidence inspiring names like 
Henry Kissinger,

939
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,710
Cia,
chief,

940
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:37,780
Michael Hayden,
former acting cio,

941
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,840
had Michael Morel and former Bush era 
homeland security chief Michael 

942
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,550
Chertoff.
These people now have their hands on 

943
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,790
what is essentially a direct lever over 
nationwide news distribution.

944
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,870
It's hard though to state the potential 
mischief that lurks behind this union of

945
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:57,871
Internet platforms and would be 
government censors at Kennedy's.

946
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:59,740
Read you one more paragraph because this
is.

947
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,300
This is exactly what we're talking 
about.

948
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:06,301
He says,
it is already a scandal that these 

949
00:41:06,301 --> 00:41:08,401
defacto private media regulators have 
secret algorithmic processes that pushed

950
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:11,500
down some news organizations in favor of
others,

951
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:16,501
which they do witness the complaints by 
outlets like alternate truth dig and 

952
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:20,881
others that big platforms have been 
deemphasizing alternative sites in the 

953
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:24,190
name of combating fake news.
But this week's revelation is worse when

954
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:29,191
facebook works with the government and 
want to want to be star chamber 

955
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:32,731
organizations like the Atlantic Council 
to delete sites on national security 

956
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:36,841
grounds using secret methodology.
It opens the door to nightmare 

957
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,720
possibilities that you'd only find in 
Dystopian novels.

958
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,750
So he goes out and it's,
it's awesome what he says,

959
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:42,760
but I'm.

960
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,490
We would have more comfort if.
I mean,

961
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:50,550
there's no,
like one of the things that they're 

962
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,550
doing is they use that blanket term hate
speech.

963
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,210
Yeah.
So by the way,

964
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,020
so now they're trying to put a bill.
Have you heard about this in Congress to

965
00:41:55,021 --> 00:42:00,021
make police a protected class of people?
So if you say shit about them now it's 

966
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:00,870
considered hate speech.
Did you know that?

967
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,850
Yeah.
They're trying to make peep.

968
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,140
Yes.
So fuck.

969
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:06,510
The police would be considered hate 
speech.

970
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:09,360
So they would just retroactively arrest 
Nwa.

971
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,880
They could not iced tea,
man.

972
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,800
Cop Killer.
Right motherfucking cop killer.

973
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,620
And so now if you do have a rally that's
against the police,

974
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:21,621
that's a hate rally and they can take 
your youtube channel down if you said 

975
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:22,880
hate stuff about the cops and such.
So.

976
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,290
So that that's where we are.
Hate speech.

977
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,840
The fuck.
How come I'm not allowed to hate shit by

978
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:29,340
the way.
I hate Nazi's.

979
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:32,310
Can I say I hate fucking Nazis.
I hate the KKK.

980
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:34,530
Can I say I hate them?
That's hate speech.

981
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,780
I.
You strongly disliked the KKK.

982
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,440
You can strongly disliked something.
When I was a kid,

983
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:45,441
I hated the fucking dodgers.
I know speech because I was a cubs fan 

984
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:47,430
and the doctors always kicked out.
It's fish.

985
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,530
Yeah.
Hate speech is a strange blanket term.

986
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:51,350
Almost like drugs,
you know,

987
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,190
drugs is caffeine,
but it's also heroin.

988
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,890
You know,
it's like drugs.

989
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,760
What's wrong with it?
I don't understand what it is.

990
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,180
There's hate out there.
So what?

991
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,700
So what's.
So by the way,

992
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,940
I

993
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,670
bad way of expressing things like hate 
speech is,

994
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,360
it's not a good descriptive because I 
agree.

995
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,630
When you,
when you stopped the,

996
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,330
what does it entail?
Like you know,

997
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:16,331
I had a conversation with a woman at 
Youtube about Sam Harris and I'm a 

998
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:23,350
Douglas Murray and a podcast where they 
had had a conversation and someone put 

999
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:26,360
it on their youtube channel in their 
playlist,

1000
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,150
just put it in their playlist and they 
got a community guidelines.

1001
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,540
Oh,
I,

1002
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,420
I asked why and the woman said very 
cleanly it was hate speech.

1003
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,010
And I said,
what are you talking about?

1004
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,450
I go,
did you listen to it?

1005
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,630
It was a two intellectuals to public 
intellectuals discretion discussing 

1006
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,010
immigration and some of the problems 
that Europe is having right now.

1007
00:43:46,011 --> 00:43:51,011
And you decided that that's hate speech 
and you don't even know what they said 

1008
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:54,280
but that.
But the fact that she's so confidently 

1009
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,561
described it in that way sort of,
it sort of embodies what this problem 

1010
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:58,610
is,
is that they have these blanket terms.

1011
00:43:58,611 --> 00:44:03,611
There were other throw on problems and 
there's a million other fires to put 

1012
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:07,061
out.
So there's no more needed to put any 

1013
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:07,061
more consideration to this.
This guy is a problem.

1014
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,480
This is problematic.
This is hate speech.

1015
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,170
Shut it down.

1016
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:15,270
People don't realize how bad it is for 
all you do because you know this story.

1017
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,530
But people go,
Oh,

1018
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:18,810
good for Alex Jones.
He shouldn't be able to do that stuff.

1019
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,860
What?
He's doing that good.

1020
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,980
I'm like,
do you not understand that this is the 

1021
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,550
shot across the bow,
that if they can do this to Alex Jones,

1022
00:44:26,551 --> 00:44:31,551
that they're coming.
I've already been trashed by the 

1023
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:31,551
establishment media,
by the Washington Post,

1024
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:35,781
by.
I've already been equated to pedophiles 

1025
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:38,541
and those kinds of things and conspiracy
theorists and I been in articles with 

1026
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:38,541
Alex Jones.
They've done it to me.

1027
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,830
So because I tell the truth about the 
war,

1028
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,240
right?
And so,

1029
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:46,020
uh,
the antidote to bad speech,

1030
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,210
if you really hate what Alex Jones is 
doing,

1031
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,790
the antidote to bad speech is not 
censorship.

1032
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,400
The antidote to bad speech is more 
speech.

1033
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,600
If you think,
if you think what Alex Jones is doing 

1034
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,581
needs to be debunked,
create a facebook page called debunking 

1035
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:01,581
Alex Jones and debunk him.

1036
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:03,780
The old Kyle Kalinsky does that kind of 
stuff all the time.

1037
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,600
People do that stuff all the time.
That's how you convert.

1038
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,870
If you're afraid of an idea,
you don't shut down the idea,

1039
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,080
you expose the idea and you debunk it,
but if you have a private platform and 

1040
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,671
you own this and you start a business 
and your businesses putting up youtube 

1041
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:23,901
videos and you decide that someone is 
putting up something that's hurtful and 

1042
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:27,951
damaging and racist and it could be used
to attack large groups of people and 

1043
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:32,661
then you see like all the craziness 
that's been connected to the alt right 

1044
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:35,940
movement and you associate that with 
this individual.

1045
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,540
Do you have to keep that on your 
platform?

1046
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,660
I mean there's no regulation right now.
No,

1047
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,790
not like technic public utilities or it 
should be though.

1048
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:49,791
That's my point.
My point is that 70 percent of the 

1049
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:50,430
people get their news from Google and 
facebook and they're a monopoly,

1050
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:50,730
right?

1051
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,290
So they had planned on ballistic powers.
70 present.

1052
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:53,900
Yeah,
that's,

1053
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,460
that was,
uh,

1054
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,110
that was a stat I read today.
So you can't.

1055
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,160
It's like,
well,

1056
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:00,600
it's written that turn on and off.
I believe it.

1057
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,290
Hey,
they took.

1058
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,680
They took stretch.
Yeah.

1059
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,170
They,
you think it's a stretch?

1060
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,950
It's says 45 percent of the people get 
straight from facebook.

1061
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,980
That means $150.
Million people are on facebook every 

1062
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:12,980
single day.
Yeah,

1063
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,310
I would think that's not accurate.
No,

1064
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:16,240
but I think that's right.
But when they get their news,

1065
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,820
we don't have three people in this room 
aren't.

1066
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:19,650
So that's three people right here.
They're aren't.

1067
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,330
But I get my news from Google.
Good.

1068
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,430
I have that Google App on my phone and 
every,

1069
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,130
every day I go to it in the morning when
I'm taking a shit and I go over like,

1070
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:30,960
what's crazy today?
What's happening?

1071
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:32,440
Oh,
new porsche coming out.

1072
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,910
One sentence like Sacha Baron Cohen do 
one sentence.

1073
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,920
Let's see what they said.
I just looked at it.

1074
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,300
It's what it said.
Forty five percent.

1075
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,470
I get it from,
from a facebook ad to.

1076
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:47,510
Is it a Gallup poll?
It was according to their stats and I 

1077
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:47,510
went back to read another rolling stone 
article to find out.

1078
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,280
Right,
and it's a bunch of like a facebook 

1079
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:52,890
article,
selling advertisements,

1080
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,440
trying to find the data.
So even even,

1081
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,610
even if you clip it with those,
we can't deny like Alex Jones cannot now

1082
00:46:59,611 --> 00:46:59,970
go,
well,

1083
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:03,900
just go to the other youtube,
just go to the other facebook.

1084
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:08,901
There isn't another.
So we have to recognize that the way we 

1085
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:11,870
are organized as a society,
that the town square is now owned by 

1086
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,600
corporations who that need to be 
regulated.

1087
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:13,920
Right?
Like before,

1088
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:17,100
if you know when 18 t was the phone 
carrier for everybody,

1089
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,500
they couldn't go,
I'm not going to give Alex Jones a phone

1090
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,830
service because I don't like the shit.
He's saying that.

1091
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,780
So you know,
we,

1092
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,360
you can't deny services,
somebody,

1093
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:29,361
all that stuff.
That's not really a valid comparison 

1094
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:30,400
because the phone wasn't distributed

1095
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:35,410
information to people.
The phone service is just a method of 

1096
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:35,410
communication.
It was just a utility.

1097
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,480
What he's able to do through info wars 
is if you've got them on your platform,

1098
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:46,140
he's going to say some things and he's 
going to use your platform to say some 

1099
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:46,750
things that you know,
might not be true.

1100
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:51,751
It might be crazy.
So you've got to decide like when does 

1101
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:54,631
it become a problem?
And I think where they drew the line 

1102
00:47:54,631 --> 00:47:54,631
with Sandy Hook.

1103
00:47:54,631 --> 00:47:54,820
So here's what I say,
Joe,

1104
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,910
uh,
we need to treat these as public 

1105
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
utilities because they are right 
facebook,

1106
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:02,680
there is no alternative.
There is an alternative to youtube.

1107
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,990
We need to deregulate them.
Well,

1108
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:07,480
it's a long overdue by the way.
And they are monopolies.

1109
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:12,481
We,
there's obvious to everyone that there 

1110
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:12,481
are monopolies,
but you know,

1111
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:15,180
when you,
when you invent something called 

1112
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,180
whatsapp and then facebook buys it for 
$20,

1113
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,180
billion dollars,
there's a monopoly,

1114
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,930
there's no way.
There's no way to,

1115
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,620
to compete with these people.
So these are monopolies.

1116
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:23,230
They need to be regulated and people's 
need to be protected.

1117
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,110
And it,
it,

1118
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,290
it,
that's how,

1119
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,320
that's where we need to go because right
now we're leaving it up to the whims of 

1120
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:31,320
a billion.
Like you'd say,

1121
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,850
Hey,
if Alex Jones really did some shit that 

1122
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,531
was wrong and he should be taken off,
or his free speech should be a bridge 

1123
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:37,531
for it,
do it.

1124
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,920
Let's do it.
Go go to a court or go to a thing or go.

1125
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,470
People go,
well,

1126
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,500
he docks his people and he didn't.
I go is if doxing is illegal,

1127
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,050
he should be prosecuted.
If that's what happened,

1128
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,350
but you shouldn't take away.
Did he docs people?

1129
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,900
That's what they're saying.
They're saying he's died.

1130
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,180
He wanted he docs people from newtown or
whatever from the school shooting,

1131
00:48:55,181 --> 00:49:00,181
so that's what they're talked about.
The individuals that he gave their 

1132
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:00,520
addresses and their names.
That's what they are saying,

1133
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:05,521
that he decay,
but let's find out if he actually did 

1134
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:05,521
that because that sounds crazy.
I,

1135
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:05,800
I,
I'm,

1136
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:06,790
I don't know if he did,

1137
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,050
but they're not saying what he actually 
did.

1138
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:13,850
This is what's crazy.
I keep hearing that he promoted the idea

1139
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:18,851
that sandy hook was a false,
was false and that it was a false flag 

1140
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,620
and that these were all actors.
I don't know if he actually said that.

1141
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,000
I think what he actually said was,
I don't know if that happened.

1142
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,850
I think that's what he actually said.
People are saying,

1143
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:36,851
well,
that's promoting the idea that it was a 

1144
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,431
hoax someone,
but I want to know if that's what he 

1145
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:39,431
really said.
See,

1146
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:40,400
I don't know if that's even the case 
because I've heard it.

1147
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I've heard it written that he promoted 
the idea that sandy hook was a 

1148
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,300
conspiracy,
but I did not quoting.

1149
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,180
When they say that there's no quotes,
there's no.

1150
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:53,810
Sandy Hook was a hoax.
Those kids were actors.

1151
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,690
Those kids are not dead.
I don't see that anywhere,

1152
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,910
but they keep attributing that to him 
without quotation.

1153
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,090
But again,
if this.

1154
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,840
If there was some kind of process due 
process where you could go back and look

1155
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:06,170
at the transcript.
No,

1156
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:11,490
not only that.
If during this whole time where he's 

1157
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,440
being tried,
he was still labeled to be on youtube 

1158
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,531
and have his videos.
He could show in his videos that he 

1159
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:20,071
didn't say that he could show what he 
actually said and tell you what he 

1160
00:50:20,071 --> 00:50:22,420
actually said and show clips.
He can't do that anymore.

1161
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,380
So now the narrative is completely in 
the hands of the mainstream media,

1162
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,440
100 percent.
So the Alex Jones narrative is being 

1163
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,770
taken 100 percent out of his hands and 
now it's in the mainstream media and now

1164
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,730
there's sandy hook denier,
conspiracy theorists,

1165
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,350
right wing,
lunatic,

1166
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,730
all these different things.
Which mayor,

1167
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,760
if some of it.
I mean Alex my fucking nuts.

1168
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,210
So my point is we've had nuts.
People would always tell that when I was

1169
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:48,780
a kid,
Joe,

1170
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,260
maybe you remember Johnny Carson used to
go ape shit about the national enquirer.

1171
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,880
Yes.
Do you remember that?

1172
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:58,881
And it was a big deal.
He would stop his show and I'm putting 

1173
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:01,641
my foot down about this.
They still have the national and nobody 

1174
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,460
said take it out of the supermarkets.
Nobody was like,

1175
00:51:02,461 --> 00:51:07,461
we've got a band in that newspaper 
because we can't handle the ideas from 

1176
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:07,470
this newspaper that they're still right 
there.

1177
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:08,550
You go to Ralph's,
they're right there.

1178
00:51:08,551 --> 00:51:09,990
They're the last thing you see before 
they leave.

1179
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,870
They're right at the eye level for kids.
Nobody what says,

1180
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:14,850
take away the national.
And I went to facebook.

1181
00:51:14,851 --> 00:51:16,940
They still have a facebook page.
Natural acquirer.

1182
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,620
Yes.
So does the World News daily.

1183
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,680
And you know what the first news news 
story was that came up on world news 

1184
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,790
dailies was a British man can only 
dedicate through his mouth.

1185
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,120
That was the first story that came up.
The first story.

1186
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,700
You don't have to look for it.
British man,

1187
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,770
Devin.
Kate's through his mouth.

1188
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,290
I'm like,
dude,

1189
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:39,660
this is like South Park and it's not 
like you want them to be taken down as 

1190
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:45,471
well.
But it's what's interesting is like 

1191
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:45,471
World News daily and

1192
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:45,471
Star magazine,
all those,

1193
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:46,850
they've sort of been there a joke like,
you know,

1194
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:47,570
it's not real,
you know,

1195
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,000
the enquirer is not real,
but we know that,

1196
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:50,600
but it's not.

1197
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,380
It's just finding those.
So.

1198
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:55,440
But he's buying.
Are they buying the other kind of buying

1199
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,470
somebody watches professional wrestling.

1200
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,610
Here it goes,
lawsuit quotes,

1201
00:52:00,611 --> 00:52:02,110
Jones saying.
Yeah.

1202
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,020
So sandy hook is a synthetic.
Completely fake.

1203
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,570
Is,
is a thin synthetic.

1204
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,890
Completely fake with actors in my view,
manufactured.

1205
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,830
Okay.
I would show the visual,

1206
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,410
right?
January 13th,

1207
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:20,860
2015.
The lawsuit quotes Joan saying.

1208
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,960
Yeah.
So Sandy.

1209
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,900
Yeah.
So sandy hook is a synthetic,

1210
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,420
completely fake with actors.
My view manufactured.

1211
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:36,610
Yeah,
you that you actually nail that 

1212
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:39,400
impression.
I spent a lot of time with that dude 

1213
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,400
drunk.
If there's a.

1214
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,400
he's.
I'm like,

1215
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,310
that's,
that's a real problem saying something 

1216
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:44,310
like that.
It's crazy.

1217
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:44,310
But he's,
he's look,

1218
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:47,020
he,
his whole business is saying things that

1219
00:52:47,021 --> 00:52:51,850
are sometimes right and saying things 
that are sometimes absolutely wrong,

1220
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:52,860
you know?
And,

1221
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,940
and that's.
And it's all wild and it's all 

1222
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,381
globalists.
And you ever seen that song that they 

1223
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:03,040
did with these guys?
Took his actual words and rants,

1224
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,180
but then they have like this like emo 
song singing the words.

1225
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,220
No fucking genius.
Would we get pulled over off of Youtube 

1226
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,910
if we play that?
Let's find out if we get yanked for this

1227
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:15,520
one because it's brilliant because it's,
it's a parody,

1228
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,680
but it's so.
It's so deep.

1229
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,940
Focus on.
Yeah.

1230
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,460
He said he was fine enough.
There's two indie folk,

1231
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,400
emo.
Just,

1232
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,430
you know,
some low testosterone music.

1233
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,970
Please listen to this.
Listen,

1234
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:27,870
listen,
listen to this.

1235
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,180
And that's why we're just doing simple 
things.

1236
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:33,690
Pointing out that we're meant to be a 
nature natural and this is where we find

1237
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:38,691
the source that God made your transcend 
the new world order and that's why they 

1238
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:38,691
want to try to keep us out of it.

1239
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,970
Factors keeping

1240
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,240
what?
Taking audio out.

1241
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,810
Oh,
you're taking the audio off.

1242
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,280
Alex Jones rants as an indie folk song 
for people that are just listening to 

1243
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:06,590
this.
You gotta Google this because we removed

1244
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,930
the sound from Youtube.
Oh,

1245
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:11,180
okay.
Babies.

1246
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,320
Babies.
We love.

1247
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:18,340
Say we want to eat babies.
I have the video you just said could not

1248
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:23,870
fill it.
Oh,

1249
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,690
Paul and Hillary posts.
But like so far,

1250
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,700
this is song literal Fab,
Pyre potbelly.

1251
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,660
Come on.

1252
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,660
Oh,
oh my God.

1253
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,010
Uh,
you know,

1254
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:27,310
I think there's something.
There's something about his struggle 

1255
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:31,901
right now that's representative of the 
chaotic world that we live in,

1256
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,910
that that he does have this giant voice 
than he does is they have this giant 

1257
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:41,891
following and that it is this,
this is actual words come out in song 

1258
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:46,871
like that and are so hysterical and that
they think that somehow or another 

1259
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:51,500
yanking this guy off all these platforms
is gonna like remove it.

1260
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,740
Do they understand the streisand effect?
Because this is just gonna.

1261
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:58,370
It's going to be another way,
but what's the streisand effect?

1262
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:01,730
Barbara streisand had a house in Malibu,
just giant ass house.

1263
00:56:01,731 --> 00:56:05,270
They took pictures of it and she went 
ape shit and you know,

1264
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:10,300
complained to all these newspapers and 
complained to the police and everything 

1265
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,740
that they're taking photos of her house 
and get the fuck Outta here.

1266
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:17,741
This I'm Barbara streisand.
And because of that it became a giant 

1267
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,711
story that Barbara streisand is pissed.
If someone's showing her house and 

1268
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:20,711
they're like,
wow,

1269
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,320
it must be a hell of a house.
Where is it?

1270
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,430
And then there it is.
The effects is a phenomenon.

1271
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,110
There's the house whereby an attempt to 
hide remover sensor,

1272
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,120
a piece of information,
unintended consequences of publicizing 

1273
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,720
the information more wildly,
usually facilitated by the Internet.

1274
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,230
Okay.
Yeah.

1275
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,410
No,
I thought you,

1276
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,560
but on print,
again,

1277
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:49,450
people may make the false equate.
Oh,

1278
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,860
you're defending Alex.
Joe.

1279
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:55,861
I'm not defending defending free speech,
defending free speech and I understand 

1280
00:56:55,861 --> 00:56:56,560
the argument that,
hey,

1281
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:58,510
it's a private corporation.
I get that.

1282
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:03,570
I get that.
But if you took a look at the bigger 

1283
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:03,570
picture,
the should beat.

1284
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,410
Everyone thinks the internet should be a
public utility.

1285
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:10,411
I mean,
most people do and that's what they're 

1286
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:10,411
upset that they're not treating it like 
a public utility.

1287
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:12,310
Obama administration did.
They decided to at the last minute.

1288
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,200
And so if you think the Internet should 
be a public utility,

1289
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,430
I think youtube and facebook should be a
public utility also and but there's the,

1290
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:25,510
there's an opening for other people to 
make their own youtube,

1291
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,960
like make a version of it if you have 
them an efficient capital,

1292
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,420
but you don't.
And there's some.

1293
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,410
And if you do start it,
they'll just buy you out.

1294
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,190
Like I just showed you the example of 
whatsapp with nightwood,

1295
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,040
$19,000,000,000
on whatever they paid for.

1296
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,640
It was some crazy.
So that's a,

1297
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:42,790
just eat up their competition right now.
We need to Teddy Roosevelt to come along

1298
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,160
and break up all these monopolies.
It's never gonna happen.

1299
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,990
Uh,
the end of the empire is coming.

1300
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,570
So here's the question,
like,

1301
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,160
is there a valid parallel,
a valid comparison?

1302
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Like are there people that have things 
that are more hateful that are on 

1303
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,890
youtube that haven't been deep 
platforms?

1304
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:04,420
Is it the influence that he has that 
it's terrifying?

1305
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:09,070
Is it the fact that he's a figurehead 
for this kind of stuff?

1306
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:14,250
Is that what it is that he's the.
This whole info wars movement is in some

1307
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:18,730
people's mind a figurehead for this pro 
trump thing.

1308
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,640
They're trying to stop and silence.
Like what is it?

1309
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,180
I don't know.

1310
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,670
It's very curious that it all happened 
at the same time.

1311
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:26,470
Right?
And because there's a,

1312
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:27,800
there's a,
um,

1313
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,970
in 1996 there was a law passed that 
actually insulates the platforms for 

1314
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:36,250
being sued.
Did you know that?

1315
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:39,300
So like for them.
So if someone puts up something like say

1316
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,410
he puts something up that leads to 
someone getting killed,

1317
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:42,250
right?
On facebook,

1318
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:44,160
you can't,
you can't sue youtube,

1319
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,380
you can't sue facebook for it.
That's in that 1996 law.

1320
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,480
Um,
so there's that.

1321
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:51,520
So I get that they're a private company,
but again,

1322
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:53,770
they have to have the protection of the 
law.

1323
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,540
They have congress protecting them.
So they have a certain.

1324
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,940
That's a certain type of regulation 
you're regulated from.

1325
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,630
You can't sue them.
Right?

1326
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,890
So I'm looking for this tweet bike,
Glenn Greenwald that really,

1327
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,530
because if we're going to take down 
here,

1328
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,750
I'll find it.
I'll find it.

1329
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,460
Here it is.
He says there's been a tactic of sensors

1330
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:23,011
for centuries.
They start with someone who was so 

1331
00:59:23,011 --> 00:59:25,411
utterly hated and marginalized that 
everyone is blinded by their hatred for 

1332
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:29,591
the first central ship target that they 
cheer and forget that they're endorsing 

1333
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:32,390
a principle and power that will then 
expand.

1334
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,830
And so right now they came for the Jews.
Yeah.

1335
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,320
Right now we're allowing,
uh,

1336
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,360
the whim of billionaires in the middle 
of the night to decide who gets to be on

1337
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,490
these monopolistic platforms and who 
doesn't.

1338
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,520
If there was 10 youtube,
no one would care,

1339
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,200
but there isn't.
There's one youtube,

1340
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:53,230
there's one facebook and they are 
monopolies and that's the world we live 

1341
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,260
in right now and that's why they are 
doing whatever the government wants them

1342
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:56,480
to because they don't want the 
government to regulate them.

1343
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,720
That's why he went there and was sipping
the water like that and trying to make 

1344
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,960
guide tat contact and be nice because he
doesn't want them to regulate them.

1345
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:08,080
He'll do it for.
I'll do Julian assange and 2010 gave a 

1346
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,870
speech which I saw recently on a plane 
where he predicted this.

1347
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,270
He was like,
the corporations are an extension of the

1348
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:13,610
government and they will do the 
censorship in the future.

1349
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,530
And that's exactly what's happening 
right now.

1350
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,050
So do you think is the government that 
sensory Alex Jones,

1351
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,080
because I would think that the 
government that's in power currently 

1352
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,301
would want to keep Alex Jones and 
position because he's a supporter of 

1353
01:00:25,301 --> 01:00:25,580
trump.
He's a supporter of,

1354
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,980
you know,
why does,

1355
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:31,990
so why does,
why is trump going after Julian assange 

1356
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:31,990
just because he's afraid he'll expose 
him someday.

1357
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,220
I don't know.
Why is he allowing the CIA to do that,

1358
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:39,550
to go after Julian assange and you know,
that just shows you how shitty the 

1359
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:42,431
journalists are in America because not 
one of them are standing up for Julian 

1360
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:45,691
to signs and they're all pretending that
when trump says mean things about Jim 

1361
01:00:45,691 --> 01:00:49,720
Acosta,
that somehow that's this unbelievable 

1362
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,740
violation of our freedom and our press 
and he's got you son of a bitch.

1363
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,010
You don't care if you cared about 
freedom of the press.

1364
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,010
You would say something about Julian 
Assan and no one is saying,

1365
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,200
what lie has Julian assange is ever 
printed.

1366
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,530
Never,
never,

1367
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,050
never,
never.

1368
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:08,260
What did Julian assange's do?
He revealed that our election was being 

1369
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,160
rigged by the Democratic Party,
not Russia,

1370
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,920
but by the Democratic Party.
And that is a sin you can commit.

1371
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:14,720
You can not tell the truth about the 
powerful.

1372
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,960
And that's what's happening right now.
And uh,

1373
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,630
you know,
he,

1374
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:22,690
he revealed the CIA in has,
although spying techniques that they can

1375
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,730
get your tv to listen to you,
your phone,

1376
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:31,030
a vault seven,
all that stuff he revealed that's why 

1377
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,030
they want to get them.
But I trump,

1378
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,810
you know,
I just think that trump is just,

1379
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,990
you know,
he's not really clued in,

1380
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:37,130
right?
He's,

1381
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:39,800
lets other.
He's glad to let the generals do the job

1382
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:41,820
and his underlings,
he doesn't really want.

1383
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,080
He wants to paint broad strokes and lets
everyone you want to kill Julian.

1384
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:45,800
Sounds.
Go ahead.

1385
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:48,020
I don't give a f that's I think how he 
feels.

1386
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:53,140
I don't think it's his plan to do it,
but everybody else underneath it wants 

1387
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:53,140
to.
And certainly the intelligence community

1388
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:57,090
and everyone forgets this.
Chuck Schumer went on Rachel Maddow show

1389
01:01:57,091 --> 01:02:02,091
like two years ago and right out in 
public said that trump is making a 

1390
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:06,191
mistake by crossing the intelligence 
community because when you mess with 

1391
01:02:06,191 --> 01:02:09,251
them,
they have six ways to Sunday to mess 

1392
01:02:09,251 --> 01:02:09,251
with you back.
Holy Shit.

1393
01:02:09,251 --> 01:02:13,571
And nobody cared that he said that.
So what he's saying is the president 

1394
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:15,080
should be afraid of unelected spooks,
unelected bureaucrats,

1395
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,100
these don't.
They should be,

1396
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,810
he should be afraid of them.
That is.

1397
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,830
And no one went.
What,

1398
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,660
what the apps could you imagine saying 
that about Barack Obama?

1399
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,720
Hey,
Barack Obama better be nice to the CA.

1400
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:28,730
They're gonna to eft with him as an 
elected official to official saying that

1401
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:31,140
almost almost sanctioning it.
Yes.

1402
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:36,230
And then we have Eugene Robinson and the
Washington Post or writing an articles 

1403
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,280
begging the deep state to undermine 
about trump's foreign policy.

1404
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,270
Did you see that article?
No.

1405
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,120
Yes.
Pulitzer Prize winner.

1406
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:45,210
First they spend all their life denying 
there is a deep state.

1407
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:50,270
And that new gene Robinson writes an 
article begging the deep state to defy 

1408
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:50,270
president,
uh,

1409
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:54,860
president trump.
So blinded by ideology that they don't 

1410
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,700
see the consequences of this.
There's unintended consequences.

1411
01:02:56,701 --> 01:03:00,150
And here they are and they're coming.
They've already come for me.

1412
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,820
They're already coming for the left 
third.

1413
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,750
This is how,
this is how this works.

1414
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:09,140
So again,
that's why I worn all my friends about 

1415
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:09,660
the Russia gate.
Nonsense Chomsky said,

1416
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:12,750
if you care about the people meddling in
our election,

1417
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:14,670
Russia would be the last place I would 
look.

1418
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:17,310
The first place to look is concentrated 
capital.

1419
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,400
That's what dictates who are going to be
our government.

1420
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:25,550
That's why we don't have the things the 
rest of the world has because we have a 

1421
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:26,610
cut.
Capital has captured our government,

1422
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,710
which is why we don't have medicare for 
all,

1423
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:33,711
which is why we don't have free college,
which is why we don't have an 

1424
01:03:33,711 --> 01:03:33,780
infrastructure plan,
which is why we're in a wars.

1425
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:38,990
Meanwhile,
people have to countries poor or low 

1426
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:38,990
income.
Sixty three percent of the country can't

1427
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:43,251
afford a thousand dollar emergency and a
quarter of all kids are in poverty in 

1428
01:03:43,251 --> 01:03:43,710
the richest country in the world.
Joe,

1429
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:48,711
what do you call a system that takes the
richest country in the world that 

1430
01:03:48,711 --> 01:03:49,230
renders half of its population poor or 
low income?

1431
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:54,350
That's a failed fucking system and 
that's what we're living in right now 

1432
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:54,420
and it's failing worldwide.

1433
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,990
Now.
If you were someone like Google though,

1434
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:03,090
or who owns youtube or if you were 
itunes or any of these platforms that 

1435
01:04:04,061 --> 01:04:09,061
have spotify when you get an 
overwhelming volume of complaints about 

1436
01:04:09,701 --> 01:04:14,701
someone who's in the news right now,
because the fact that Alex Jones is 

1437
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:18,961
being sued by the Sandy Hook parents,
this is what started this all off 

1438
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:23,340
because to people this is so egregious,
these poor parents lost their children 

1439
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:28,950
and here's this guy.
It's horrible saying that it's fake and 

1440
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:29,510
that they don't want that on their 
platform.

1441
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:33,700
So would you think that they should just
delete the episode that has that?

1442
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,840
It says that,
should they do that or should they allow

1443
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:38,710
that episode?

1444
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:40,020
I,
I,

1445
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,040
so,
uh,

1446
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,990
here's the,
here's the solution.

1447
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,670
If,
if there's,

1448
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,460
if he did do something in a video that 
is illegal,

1449
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,700
take that video down until it gets 
adjudicated.

1450
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,260
You don't see platform of 100,
you don't give him the death penalty.

1451
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:56,140
Right.
So,

1452
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,940
okay.
What about like stormfront,

1453
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,080
what have you got?
Like some white supremacist group.

1454
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:01,990
It's calling for violence against 
people.

1455
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:03,760
You Do,
you take them down.

1456
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,300
I think you would.
Again,

1457
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:10,301
you would have to,
I would like to see in some kind of 

1458
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:10,301
adjudication,
you know,

1459
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:10,301
again,
I,

1460
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:12,740
the blanket policies and things saying 
things like hate speech.

1461
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,590
It's all interpretation in bed.
Just a week ago,

1462
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:18,360
Mark Zuckerberg was defending it.
He was defending that,

1463
01:05:18,361 --> 01:05:20,320
that we have holocaust deniers on our 
platform,

1464
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,640
holocaust deniers.
Joe,

1465
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,470
and that's not fake news.
That's not going.

1466
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:25,300
You're not going to take that down like 
I just told you.

1467
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,340
They have guys deprecating out of their 
mouth.

1468
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,190
They have this thing.
They have the,

1469
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:30,940
the,
the,

1470
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:31,330
the,
uh,

1471
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,160
the national enquirer.
They're still cool.

1472
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,320
So this is a very squiggly line.
Joe.

1473
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:35,860
And again,
there's,

1474
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:38,140
there's no board,
there's no adjudication.

1475
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:39,220
It's not transparent

1476
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,280
parents,
not rational either.

1477
01:05:41,281 --> 01:05:43,170
This is not a rational debate.

1478
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,720
Uh,
let me just,

1479
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:49,810
the sheer.
Let me just give you one more thing 

1480
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,390
about what he says when this is Matt 
Taibbi.

1481
01:05:50,391 --> 01:05:55,391
He says,
the sheer market power of these 

1482
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:55,391
companies over information flow has 
always been the real threat.

1483
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:00,580
This is why breaking them up,
she'd have long ago become a national 

1484
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,010
priority instead,
as was obvious during the Senate hearing

1485
01:06:02,011 --> 01:06:06,710
with Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year,
politicians are more interested in using

1486
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,620
then curtailing the power of these 
companies.

1487
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,580
The platform for their part will cave 
rather than be regulated.

1488
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:18,790
The end game here couldn't be clearer.
This is how authoritarians marriages 

1489
01:06:18,861 --> 01:06:21,710
begin and people should be very worried.

1490
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,790
They should be worried.
They should be worried,

1491
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:29,850
especially if this does escalate.
I understand that people who believed 

1492
01:06:31,231 --> 01:06:33,820
that he's a sandy hook deniers and they 
read those words,

1493
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,240
they don't want him to have a platform.
They don't want them to be able to 

1494
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,541
spread that hate and they understood.
I understand that they would feel like 

1495
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,350
imagine being one of those parents and 
you lost your kid and you're,

1496
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:49,351
you're.
You're seeing this guy on tv or on 

1497
01:06:49,351 --> 01:06:49,351
youtube saying it's all fake.
It's,

1498
01:06:49,351 --> 01:06:51,260
it's outrageous and it's repulsive.
I agree.

1499
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:55,540
It's offensive and I get that,
but I think it's,

1500
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,020
it's,
it's very dangerous.

1501
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:04,830
It's very dangerous to silence people 
that may or may not have any other 

1502
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:11,941
recourse in terms of like he doesn't 
have the ability to defend himself,

1503
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,240
it doesn't have the ability to make a 
video about it unless he puts it on his 

1504
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,130
own website and then who's going to 
watch it like this,

1505
01:07:19,131 --> 01:07:21,130
the stuff that they're doing with 
youtube,

1506
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:24,130
it's just,
it's a slippery slope,

1507
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,920
you know,
and especially when they use these terms

1508
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:31,921
like hate speech,
they're not like when you say like what 

1509
01:07:31,921 --> 01:07:31,921
do they say?

1510
01:07:31,921 --> 01:07:32,530
And they say that he violated their 
terms,

1511
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,970
correct.
Yes.

1512
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:39,150
So what,
what are those terms that he violated 

1513
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:41,281
and what is the specific violation?
Like what are the words that he said 

1514
01:07:41,281 --> 01:07:41,920
where you were like,
enough is enough.

1515
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,560
If that's the case,
how did you let him get away with saying

1516
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,620
all this other shit for years and years 
and what,

1517
01:07:46,621 --> 01:07:48,250
when,
when do you draw this line?

1518
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:50,530
Like just that video that we played,
you know,

1519
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:52,060
they smell like sulfur,
they eat it,

1520
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:54,560
they want to eat babies screaming.
I love Satan.

1521
01:07:54,561 --> 01:07:56,890
And the one of the babies like,
Whoa,

1522
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:59,590
what?
Where does the line get drawn?

1523
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:00,650
I just,
I don't,

1524
01:08:00,651 --> 01:08:05,651
I don't think.
I don't think that should be up to 

1525
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:08,110
subjectivity.
I think that should be a very,

1526
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,730
very hard question that's answered with 
very clear facts.

1527
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,020
You

1528
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,190
should have an adversarial judicial with

1529
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:21,190
an impartial judge or jury.
And how would you even get someone 

1530
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,540
impartial instead?
They have inhouse decide decisions.

1531
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:23,790
Well,
you heard that.

1532
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:26,660
I mean you heard Matt Taibbi does 
delineate the people who are involved in

1533
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:31,661
this stuff and by the way,
facebook's taken down pages of people 

1534
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:33,210
who are Palestinians because the Israeli
government tells them to do it.

1535
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,070
Do you know about that?
Right?

1536
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,690
I had heard about it.
Yes.

1537
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:39,940
So that's them doing the bidding.
The government says take a down,

1538
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,690
take it you.
They don't get to free speech.

1539
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:46,691
Okay.
Because I don't want the government to 

1540
01:08:46,691 --> 01:08:46,691
get mad at me because we're making so 
much goddamn money right now.

1541
01:08:46,691 --> 01:08:47,720
I don't want the government to get mad 
at us.

1542
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:49,250
That's what facebook and youtube is 
doing.

1543
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:52,910
See if I would like that.
If someone,

1544
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:58,290
you know,
I'm not saying that no one should be 

1545
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:58,290
taken down.

1546
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,030
If someone's calling for the death of 
all black people and like maybe it's not

1547
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:04,031
a good place to give them a platform,
but I feel like the problem that I'm 

1548
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:07,430
having with this is these things like 
air quotes,

1549
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,880
hate speech,
because I told you that they said that 

1550
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,030
about Sam Harrison Douglas Murray.
Now that is fucking crazy.

1551
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,940
So when is it stopping hate speech?
Like when?

1552
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:20,300
When do you draw the line?
When it's mildly offensive,

1553
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:22,220
is that hate speech?
Like where's it go?

1554
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:24,920
Where does it go?
Where we're not allowed to hate people.

1555
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:28,580
I don't understand why I don't get that.
I'm not being a dick.

1556
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:31,460
I honestly,
why aren't you allowed to hate things?

1557
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,520
Right.
I don't.

1558
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:37,700
I understand that calling for action I 
think is the call for action might be.

1559
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:42,701
I mean,
I guess it's a legal term that this is 

1560
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:42,701
not a legal term though.

1561
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:44,360
The when they blanket things with hate 
speech,

1562
01:09:44,361 --> 01:09:46,760
like we were saying,
was calling something a drug,

1563
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,390
this is an illegal drug.
Well,

1564
01:09:48,391 --> 01:09:50,960
what if caffeine becomes an illegal drug
then?

1565
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:53,870
Is that the same as meth?
It's clearly not.

1566
01:09:53,871 --> 01:09:57,020
There's different things.
So when you say hate speech and you also

1567
01:09:57,021 --> 01:10:02,021
lumped Douglas Murray having an 
intellectual conversation with Sam 

1568
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:03,290
Harris about immigration,
you lump that in.

1569
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,360
So that's the kind of soft.
And so did you know that right before 

1570
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,010
fourth of July there was a newspaper,
I think it was in Texas.

1571
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:12,530
And so they wanted to for the fourth of 
July,

1572
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,050
they wanted to post the declaration of 
independence.

1573
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:17,900
So they posted the first half of it.
Did you know about this?

1574
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,940
Facebook gave him a strike for hate 
speech,

1575
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:25,990
hate speech.
They gave him a strike and so now 

1576
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:25,990
they're like,
they were like,

1577
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:25,990
that was an algorithm though,
right?

1578
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:30,670
They picked up some of the phrase or the
phrasing in there about slavery and 

1579
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,670
stuff like that.
And then being animals or something like

1580
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:32,330
that.
I don't know,

1581
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:33,800
something like that.
I'm not sure what it was.

1582
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:36,110
But.
And then the newspaper said,

1583
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:41,170
now we're afraid to post the second half
of the declaration because we'll get a 

1584
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:41,930
second strike and they might pull our 
whole page.

1585
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,480
Yeah.
So again,

1586
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:46,910
when they released that strike.
Correct.

1587
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:48,070
So,
so yeah.

1588
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,600
So what is this book?
Pill?

1589
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:53,660
What is this idea that I need a nanny 
state to protect me from the ideas?

1590
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:58,970
I think they're worried about the power 
of propaganda and it's just they don't 

1591
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:02,561
know exactly what the consequences of 
suppressing that power of propaganda 

1592
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:03,590
are.
I think that's really the primary issue.

1593
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:07,040
They're worried that a guy like Alex 
Jones already has this massive following

1594
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,450
his what he's done by calling sandy hook
fake may,

1595
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:13,500
may be awful,
I believe is,

1596
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,100
but

1597
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,060
is it enough to completely diy platform 
him and how?

1598
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,250
How are they,
how are they?

1599
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,180
Even if it was,
let's say it was,

1600
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,130
let's just say you and I agree that it 
is okay.

1601
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:30,660
They shouldn't.
Shouldn't there still be some kind of a 

1602
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:30,660
process?
There should be.

1603
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,740
That's what I'm saying.
It shouldn't be.

1604
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,330
Even if we agreed,
and again,

1605
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,520
I hate that.
I hate it as much as you hate it,

1606
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,050
I'm with you and that people are going 
to.

1607
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:39,060
I know Joe,
last time I was on your show,

1608
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,980
I said,
I said people are going to take what I'm

1609
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:44,040
saying right now and twisted and that's 
exactly what they did to me last night.

1610
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,590
So I'm sure people did who took it and 
twisted it.

1611
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,350
I don't want,
you don't have to name names,

1612
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:52,080
but what did they do?
They say they twisted what we were.

1613
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:54,510
So when we're talking about seth rich,
they twisted and I said,

1614
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:55,020
you know,
I did,

1615
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:57,090
was covered on my show until this day.

1616
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:59,280
People still say I was pushing it.
I do a new show.

1617
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:04,281
I covered it,
but even discussing it and even you 

1618
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:04,281
can't even discuss like I couldn't cover
it,

1619
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:06,390
couldn't discuss it and that.
And so that's exactly what happened.

1620
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:09,480
Somebody cut me saying that and cut some
other stuff and put it together.

1621
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,980
And I was like,
son of a bitch.

1622
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:11,940
But you,
so what are you going to do?

1623
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:12,810
Right?
So what are you gonna do?

1624
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,550
So,
um,

1625
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,100
so I just want people to know this is 
again,

1626
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:22,130
I'm just as offended as everybody.
I'm saying we need to have these things 

1627
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,250
be public utilities for a lot of 
reasons.

1628
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:24,710
And that,
um,

1629
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:29,900
you know exactly what Matt Tie.
He'd be said what the end game here is 

1630
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:30,720
very clear and they want to be able to 
censor people.

1631
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,870
They want to be able to censor and the 
first people are going to come after his

1632
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:34,950
left wing organizations.

1633
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,480
They're could come after black lives 
matter.

1634
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:38,000
They're connected,
already come after left.

1635
01:12:38,001 --> 01:12:39,740
He's like,
why did they think they're going to come

1636
01:12:39,741 --> 01:12:42,100
after to black lives matter?
What do you mean there?

1637
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:44,180
I their hate speech against the police.
You kidding me.

1638
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,290
They already said they're controlled by 
the Russians.

1639
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:51,380
Who is they?
Who is they saying that and who's they 

1640
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:51,380
gonna come after them.
What do you mean by that?

1641
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:51,840
So.
Well,

1642
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:53,510
the FBI will infiltrate them.
They are,

1643
01:12:53,511 --> 01:12:54,600
I'm sure they already have,
you know,

1644
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:56,500
how that works.
So you know,

1645
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:58,590
how all that stuff works.
So that's how that stuff works.

1646
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:03,591
And um,
and then just credit them and then they 

1647
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:03,591
will commit violence in their name and 
say,

1648
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:04,740
oh look,
black lives matters are violent.

1649
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:05,790
No,
that was a cop doing it,

1650
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,570
you know,
that didn't help that.

1651
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:08,180
That's what happened up in Dapple,
you know,

1652
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,690
that's the kind of stuff they do up 
there.

1653
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,390
And then provocateur.
Exactly.

1654
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:13,380
Right.
So by the way,

1655
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:17,490
I learned about that from Alex Jones.
So that's the problem with Alex Jones.

1656
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:19,080
He's right about stuff sometimes.

1657
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:21,400
Well,
he was way more right about stuff in the

1658
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:26,401
past.
Alex himself and I've talked to him 

1659
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,460
about this,
says he drinks too much and he's getting

1660
01:13:27,461 --> 01:13:32,461
too crazy.
It needs to go on a diet and exercise 

1661
01:13:32,461 --> 01:13:33,930
and start getting his life in order and 
he takes things too far sometimes and he

1662
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:37,210
should take those off the rails.
He goes off the rails like he.

1663
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:42,240
He and I had a conversation,
but he got mad at me for saying that I 

1664
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,110
didn't think George Soros was a Nazi and
so he had this whole thing.

1665
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:49,120
We ranted ray and then we talked back 
and forth and he apologized and he said,

1666
01:13:49,361 --> 01:13:53,050
I sometimes have to far what I'm talking
to.

1667
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:58,051
Aliens will say that unit,
but I think he recognizes that sometimes

1668
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,320
he's just caught up in that cycle of 
outrage,

1669
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,510
that cycle of outrage.
It just,

1670
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,200
there's no room for error.

1671
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,560
There's no room to step back and sort of
reset is.

1672
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:16,330
It's this constant outrage constantly 
under attack.

1673
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,480
And then there's these words that get 
thrown around that sort of lose their 

1674
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,060
meaning,
like globalists and shills and,

1675
01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:25,260
and,
and you know,

1676
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,630
and this,
this sort of attitude that there's this,

1677
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:34,110
there's this cabal of evil that is 
trying to take,

1678
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:38,380
take over the world.
And at one point Alex had this idea that

1679
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:42,820
they were going to try to kill off most 
people and you remember that.

1680
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:48,270
I heard about it.
There's this idea that they wanted to a 

1681
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,510
youth and I orj was genocide.
They wanted to,

1682
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:54,810
they wanted to break it down to what is 
the word where they talk about doing 

1683
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:55,900
that to talk about reducing the 
population.

1684
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:58,570
There's like some sort of a conspiracy 
theorist,

1685
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,600
term of reduction of population to a 
sustainable number of super evil 

1686
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,420
geniuses that could live forever.

1687
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:06,490
And they wanted to get it down to like,
you know,

1688
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:11,670
500 million people worldwide that can 
live for a million years or some crazy 

1689
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:15,610
shit.
But I think that that's that whole cycle

1690
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,880
of like constant outrage and 
everything's a conspiracy and you get 

1691
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,550
whacked,
whacked out and caught up in it.

1692
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:29,700
If you go back to Alex's earlier videos,
I met Alex in 98 I believe,

1693
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:36,300
and back then Alex was,
he was going after George w dot Bush 

1694
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,650
when George W dot Bush was running for 
president and he was saying that this 

1695
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:41,590
guy is a,
he's a,

1696
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,400
he's a puppet and that he's a puppet of 
the CIA and you know,

1697
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:46,290
and,
and he,

1698
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,300
you know,
he supports genocide and he was showing 

1699
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:51,550
up at campaign rallies and they were 
arresting him.

1700
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,700
He was anti right wing.
I mean he was,

1701
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:57,700
he was anti what he thought was this 
globalist agenda.

1702
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:03,150
He also infiltrated Bohemian Grove when 
everybody thought the Bohemian Grove is 

1703
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:03,700
nonsense.
There's nothing really going on.

1704
01:16:03,701 --> 01:16:04,270
He's like,
no,

1705
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:08,140
these really rich people are getting 
together with heads of state and foreign

1706
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:11,230
dignitaries and they're dressing up like
fucking druids.

1707
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:15,430
And they have an effigy that they burned
in front of the owl God Molek and people

1708
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:16,210
like,
he's crazy.

1709
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:19,240
Then he releases the video and like,
oh my God,

1710
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,480
they really do do that.
Like he did some good work.

1711
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,570
The World Trade Organization protests in
his,

1712
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:29,830
his video nine slash 11,
a road to tyranny right after nine slash

1713
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:34,831
11.
He releases this video that shows that 

1714
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:37,830
the World Trade Organization protests 
were infiltrated by these agent 

1715
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,990
provocateurs who are most likely 
government agents with government agent.

1716
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:42,010
Boots on,
by the way,

1717
01:16:42,011 --> 01:16:44,890
shows this in the video.
They smash windows.

1718
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,170
They're all wearing masks,
had light things on fire.

1719
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,840
Then they're all.
They all hold up in one house.

1720
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:53,260
They negotiate with the police and are 
eventually released.

1721
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,810
This is all done under.
I mean he proved all this.

1722
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,140
He showed all how this is going like,
look at these peaceful protesters.

1723
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:04,290
Then the consequences of that,
they established a no protest line at 

1724
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:09,181
the WTO where you couldn't go by with a 
pin on have you tried to get through 

1725
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:12,170
with a that said,
w t o with a red line through it.

1726
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:14,540
They told you you could not wear that 
pin.

1727
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,750
You can't come through here.
This is a node protest zone,

1728
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,270
and he's like,
this is the consequences of this kind of

1729
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:22,970
censorship and this is how they 
establish the censorship.

1730
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:28,180
They make it seem like your organization
is violent and dangerous by introducing 

1731
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,200
violent,
dangerous elements in the,

1732
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:33,320
in the form of an undercover police 
officers or military.

1733
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:38,440
They smash windows tip over newspaper 
stands and it was fucking create chaos 

1734
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:42,410
so that the government has to come in 
because now we have a violent situation,

1735
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,560
so then the military comes in and arrest
protestors and silences the protests so 

1736
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:52,361
they don't look embarrassing in front of
all these people from foreign countries 

1737
01:17:52,361 --> 01:17:53,000
that are coming here to the World Trade 
Organization.

1738
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,880
I didn't know he showed that,
but dude,

1739
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:58,370
he look,
he's not wrong always,

1740
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:02,090
and he was more right back then.
He was also more sane back then.

1741
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,880
His,
he was more measured and more calm.

1742
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:10,030
It wasn't this.
He didn't have the big moon face back 

1743
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:10,030
then either and he wasn't drinking as 
much.

1744
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:12,470
I don't think in the screaming and 
spitting and and you know,

1745
01:18:12,471 --> 01:18:13,430
you ask him,
he'll say,

1746
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:15,980
well,
I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer volume

1747
01:18:15,981 --> 01:18:18,690
of corruption,
all the shit that he sees every day.

1748
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:23,420
Do you remember he was crying when trump
bombed Syria?

1749
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:27,020
He was crying because he was crying that
trump fucked us.

1750
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,670
You know what I mean?
He,

1751
01:18:28,671 --> 01:18:32,840
I really genuinely believe most of the 
time that he means.

1752
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:33,940
Well,
the,

1753
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,410
the,
the,

1754
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:37,940
the thing is we look for conspiracies 
everywhere,

1755
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
like everything that's experiencing 
you're off track and I don't think 

1756
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,460
there's anyone there that can sit down 
and go,

1757
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,810
stop,
hold on.

1758
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,380
Let's examine this in a factual way.
Let's stop.

1759
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:53,530
Cut The hyperbole out and let's look at 
what the facts are and where are we 

1760
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:54,710
getting these facts and why do we think 
this is happening?

1761
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:57,650
Why do you think this is fake?
Because that sounds fucking crazy to me.

1762
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,740
No one's there to do that.
If someone was there to do that,

1763
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:04,460
I think he probably would be stopped and
would examine things.

1764
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,640
It would balance out,
you know,

1765
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:11,650
like one of the reasons why I wanted to 
have him on my podcast when I did was 

1766
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:12,290
because I wanted people to see the Alex 
that I know because people like,

1767
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:13,820
how could you know that guy?
I'm like,

1768
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,110
look at how he is when I get them high 
and we get drunk and he's laughing about

1769
01:19:18,111 --> 01:19:21,500
stuff and talking about interdimensional
child molesters and all that.

1770
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,260
This is what I wanted everybody to see.
Like this is Alex Jones.

1771
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:27,050
He's a fun guy.
It's just that,

1772
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:32,290
that is not a good position to be in 
where you're constantly looking for 

1773
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:35,240
conspiracies everywhere you go.
And you might nail a few,

1774
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,940
but then you might call out a bunch of 
them that are fake,

1775
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:42,970
which not just negates the ones that you
nailed but negates everything you say as

1776
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:48,401
soon as you're one of those guys that 
everything's a conspiracy and then dead 

1777
01:19:48,401 --> 01:19:49,610
kids aren't really dead and everyone's 
an actor.

1778
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:51,710
And like everything that you say that 
it's good,

1779
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:52,670
they're going to stop.

1780
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:58,710
My uh,
thing is that I focus on the ones that 

1781
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,880
are important,
right?

1782
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:01,960
That I think is right.
I'm like,

1783
01:20:01,961 --> 01:20:06,961
I don't,
I care about wars and the lies that are 

1784
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:12,530
told about wars from the media,
which the media pushes every war in my 

1785
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:14,120
lifetime.
So that's the ones I care about.

1786
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,840
I hear everything you're saying.
And um,

1787
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:16,800
yeah,
I don't,

1788
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:18,090
I didn't really know.
I got to say God,

1789
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,430
I didn't really know much about Alex 
Jones until the,

1790
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,150
I met him,
you know,

1791
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,860
very famously at that incident,
I didn't really,

1792
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:27,720
I never really watched them.
I went home that night.

1793
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:32,721
I watched some of his videos,
which is when I found out some of them 

1794
01:20:32,721 --> 01:20:32,721
are really funny and uh,
so I,

1795
01:20:32,721 --> 01:20:37,430
honest to God,
I didn't really know much about him and 

1796
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,430
so I don't even know this stuff.
So

1797
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:41,890
if you could find that Jamie CV,
did they pull all that stuff from 

1798
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,711
youtube?
Everything but doesn't so else have it 

1799
01:20:44,711 --> 01:20:44,720
probably on their channel.

1800
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:49,790
And I did,
I never did videos about him or 

1801
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:49,790
debunked,
but I just,

1802
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:49,790
you know,
it just,

1803
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:54,720
he wasn't in my sight line of sight.
I was busy making fun of MSNBC and CNN.

1804
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:55,980
That's what I like to do.

1805
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:56,820
Yeah,
it's,

1806
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:02,200
it's,
it's all very confusing to me and all.

1807
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,650
I don't think he should say those 
things.

1808
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:08,910
I don't think he should say lies about 
kids not being dead.

1809
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:09,880
The,
the,

1810
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,810
the horrors of being a parent and your 
kid was shot.

1811
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:16,650
And school shooting and then some guy 
saying that there are 100 percent actors

1812
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:18,950
and fake and lead.
That's horrible stuff.

1813
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:23,951
There's a guy who was one of the parents
that was a conspiracy theorist until 

1814
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:23,951
this happened,
you know,

1815
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:25,920
he was a conspiracy theorist.
He believed all that stuff.

1816
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:30,921
And then his son was killed and then 
they started calling him a fraud and 

1817
01:21:30,921 --> 01:21:34,101
saying he was an actor and saying it 
never happened and that he's a paid 

1818
01:21:34,101 --> 01:21:35,920
shill and you know,
and there's a big article about this,

1819
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:41,030
this guy.
I mean you see this guy talk and it's 

1820
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,030
heartbreaking.
You know,

1821
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,510
you read his words,
it's heartbreaking.

1822
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:46,950
You can imagine your son was murdered in
one of the biggest school maskers ever,

1823
01:21:46,951 --> 01:21:48,060
if not the biggest.
Right?

1824
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:53,540
And here's people running around,
emailing you and sending you tweets and 

1825
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:56,970
facebook messages that you're a fraud.
And then you,

1826
01:21:56,971 --> 01:22:01,971
you know,
you work for the globalists and this is 

1827
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:02,280
all just a plot to take our guns away.
It's like holy.

1828
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:08,090
These things are.
That's the people who think the old 

1829
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,290
school shootings that they're all set up
to so they can take our guns away.

1830
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:15,390
They think that about everything.
They thought that about the country 

1831
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,270
music festival shooting in Vegas because
they felt like,

1832
01:22:16,271 --> 01:22:21,271
hey,
here's a way to get those people on our 

1833
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:21,271
side because those are all the second 
amendment people,

1834
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:26,040
the country music people.
What better people to get to turn 

1835
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,180
against the second amendment that a 
bunch of people that are.

1836
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:32,260
I mean I guarantee you if you had like a
red light that went off every time,

1837
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,580
like on the top of someone's head,
if there were a national rifles agency,

1838
01:22:36,581 --> 01:22:39,340
if they were an NRA member in that 
audience,

1839
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,370
I bet there'll be a lot of fucking 
lights a,

1840
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,300
but a lot of those people are nra 
people.

1841
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:45,790
Lot of people who are gun owners.
I better just gun owners.

1842
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,040
How many people are gun owners?
A bit fucking half.

1843
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:53,100
At least half the audience.
Probably one of the strongest 

1844
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:53,100
demographics.

1845
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:53,410
You could find.
Country Music,

1846
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:54,940
gun owners.
That's a.

1847
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:57,550
that's a giant connection and so the 
thought was,

1848
01:22:57,551 --> 01:22:58,480
hey,
if this guy,

1849
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:03,700
okay,
they make this Manchurian candidate and 

1850
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,150
make them gun down all these people,
some people think you didn't even do it.

1851
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:09,151
They think they shot in the room and 
then the agents did it and they killed 

1852
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,270
all these people and then there's 
bullets coming out.

1853
01:23:10,271 --> 01:23:12,910
All these different windows and all 
these different areas and like,

1854
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:14,240
oh my God,
fuck it.

1855
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,150
You know,
it's exhausting.

1856
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,450
It's exhausting and it's also horrific,
man.

1857
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:24,480
I mean the whole thing's horrific.
The idea that they think that the 

1858
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,991
government would create a false flag 
that by the way didn't do anything 

1859
01:23:27,991 --> 01:23:31,381
second amendment still in place,
but that they would create a false flag 

1860
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:35,340
and they would be willing to gun down 
what did that he killed like 50 plus 

1861
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:38,850
people and shot like 500 something 
fucking insane like that,

1862
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,060
that,
that would be the,

1863
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,040
that that's they would get together and 
go,

1864
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:47,041
you know,
we gotta do we gotta get this guy and 

1865
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:50,280
get them,
get them to shoot all these people and 

1866
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:50,280
that's how we're going to get rid of 
guns is totally ineffective.

1867
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:50,950
It hasn't done anything.

1868
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,520
No.
A lead here.

1869
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:57,550
Here's the thing,
and I'm not the first person to make 

1870
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:57,550
this point about guns,
is people who are big,

1871
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:59,360
strong second amendment.
People say that.

1872
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:04,370
Why?
Because whenever I advocate for gun 

1873
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:04,370
control,
people say,

1874
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:04,370
oh good that only the governor will have
guns,

1875
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:05,900
which is,
it's not a bad argument,

1876
01:24:05,901 --> 01:24:06,430
right?
It's not.

1877
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,730
I,
I understand that argument.

1878
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,850
Uh,
but the whole point of view keeping your

1879
01:24:10,851 --> 01:24:15,851
guns to protect yourself from the 
government is that the government's 

1880
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,540
going to take your rights away.
So you need to have your guns to protect

1881
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,740
your rights.
Well,

1882
01:24:18,741 --> 01:24:20,120
the government already took your rights 
away.

1883
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:22,130
They're already reading every email.
They're already reading,

1884
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,920
listening on every.
You already lost your right to privacy.

1885
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:27,410
They let you keep your guns while they 
took the rest of your rights away.

1886
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:32,530
So now you still have your guns.
Now why don't you go get your rights 

1887
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:34,991
back?
You have your gun that they're never 

1888
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:34,991
going to do it,

1889
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:38,010
right?
So already report was an interesting 

1890
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:38,010
take on that,
right?

1891
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:38,800
Like the,
the one day technology to reach a point,

1892
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:43,940
you know,
for them it was like through those 

1893
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:44,530
little psychic dudes that um,
we're going to be able to predict future

1894
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:45,280
crime.
Right.

1895
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,470
And then he arrested you for a future 
crime.

1896
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:47,980
Yeah.

1897
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:49,930
[inaudible].
Yeah.

1898
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:50,530
That's kind.
Well,

1899
01:24:50,531 --> 01:24:51,280
they already cut.
Yeah.

1900
01:24:51,281 --> 01:24:53,680
They kind of do that.
Now they can arrest you for a conspiracy

1901
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:54,020
to commit.
Okay.

1902
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:54,370
Crime.

1903
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,230
But you don't even have to have a crime,
right?

1904
01:24:56,231 --> 01:24:58,300
You just have some emails,
talk and shit.

1905
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:03,710
I,
you get to have a role playing thing 

1906
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:03,710
that you do with your wife.
We talk about,

1907
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:03,710
you know,
listen to you and I,

1908
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:08,070
we're Bonnie and Clyde and we're going 
to take down the government and they 

1909
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:08,110
just fucking kick down your door in the 
middle of the night.

1910
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:10,210
Yeah.
What's that?

1911
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:13,870
Who's that comic?
Who had the ice agents breakdown?

1912
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,690
That guy.
I started following him after that.

1913
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,520
He made a joke.
Yeah.

1914
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:19,530
What was the joke?
Oh,

1915
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,080
I forget.
But that was fun.

1916
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:22,480
That's pretty funny by the way,
to.

1917
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:24,890
That guy's pretty funny.
I do know my phone.

1918
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:29,520
I forgot that story.
He tells us hilarious about those ice or

1919
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:32,800
the ice cops coming into his place.
What is his name?

1920
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,600
Jake Jake parttime,
standup comic podcast hosts and 

1921
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,871
self-described pizza delivery guy,
who in a strange twist of fate recently 

1922
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,220
found himself debating immigration 
policy with for homeland security agents

1923
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:50,221
in his home.
The agent's paint him in early morning 

1924
01:25:50,221 --> 01:25:51,400
visit last Sunday because of some jokes.
He tweeted about Cinco de Mayo.

1925
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:52,870
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1926
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,310
Okay.
This is what he said.

1927
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:59,400
Here's how Cinco de Mayo works in 2018 
white people allowed to culturally 

1928
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,570
appropriate on the condition that you 
helped destroy ice.

1929
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:04,070
You kill one ice agent.
You get to wear

1930
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,770
some barrel to kills you.
Get to wear a Poncho.

1931
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:15,260
But the problem is that you can't joke 
around about killing an agent because 

1932
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:15,260
there's,
you know.

1933
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:18,290
So if he had a Sirius xm radio show,
he'd be fired right now.

1934
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,750
Oh yeah.
Well they fired Nick Depaulo for that,

1935
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,460
for saying something very similar to 
that.

1936
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,870
And so I say about that.
It's like,

1937
01:26:23,871 --> 01:26:27,230
so nick can't make a joke about someone 
going into a university,

1938
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:27,590
go,
hey,

1939
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:29,270
next school shooter.
That was his joke.

1940
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:30,410
Next,
the professor,

1941
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:33,410
please go to the Berkeley and go to the 
teacher's lounge or something like that.

1942
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:34,340
Right.
Which everyone knows.

1943
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:36,020
It's obviously a joke.
He's a goddamn comedian.

1944
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,360
Jesus,
he's a right wing community.

1945
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,570
Can we see everybody?
So,

1946
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,920
so,
but you can go on those same radio shows

1947
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:47,921
and they'll same radio stations and you 
can advocate for killing hundreds of 

1948
01:26:47,921 --> 01:26:48,920
thousands of people in another country 
that you don't know and nobody says shit

1949
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:50,180
all the time.

1950
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,740
People do that.
People lie about.

1951
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:53,090
So that's the.
That's the weird thing,

1952
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:58,280
you know,
we can have a torture program in 

1953
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:58,280
America.
Nobody goes,

1954
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:58,280
you know,
it's just weird that the.

1955
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,410
And then the media goes along,
they don't even call it torture.

1956
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:03,290
They call it enhanced interrogation 
techniques because we're doing it.

1957
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,270
But Nick said that that's all of a 
sudden.

1958
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:10,080
So it's just such a weird squiggly 
bullshit line of morality and,

1959
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,830
and so and now Nicole would be better 
off for it anyway.

1960
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:18,430
Yeah.
Nick will be better off for it and he 

1961
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:20,201
has a podcast now,
but I think unfortunately he's doing a 

1962
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:21,470
subscription service,
which I tried to talk all these guys out

1963
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:23,420
of because you can't hear it at all for 
free.

1964
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:27,530
You have to pay and I don't know,
but it limits a bad idea.

1965
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:29,270
Yeah,
it limits your growth.

1966
01:27:29,271 --> 01:27:30,500
I mean,
he's a famous comedian,

1967
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:35,501
so I'm sure he'll get some money and I 
know he's probably doing really well 

1968
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:35,690
with it,
but it's just.

1969
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,750
It's impossible to grow.
Is it a subscription service?

1970
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:44,500
Jamie's shaking his head on Patriot for 
10 bucks or more.

1971
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:51,310
He doesn't give you more.
So start at 10 and then keep adding 

1972
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:54,191
more.
So now all we do is we need to give all 

1973
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:54,510
the way all our stuff for free,
except we do a couple of weeks.

1974
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:57,740
We'd maybe do a couple extra hours a 
week for our patrons.

1975
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,970
That's like bonus,
right?

1976
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:01,310
So you don't,
but you don't want to.

1977
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:05,870
That's not the worst thing in the world.
I just think that people have different.

1978
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,400
You do bonus stuff.
No,

1979
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:08,480
no.
Everything's free.

1980
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:10,500
Everything's free.
You're really lucky.

1981
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:12,080
Your super,
super popular.

1982
01:28:12,081 --> 01:28:17,081
Yeah,
but when I wasn't super popular it was 

1983
01:28:17,081 --> 01:28:17,081
all free too.
Yeah.

1984
01:28:17,081 --> 01:28:17,810
I had it free in the beginning when I 
was getting a thousand downloads.

1985
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,710
It's always been free.
I just.

1986
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,200
I just want to just start to kick it.

1987
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:26,230
Kick in for you.
When did you started to take off this 

1988
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:26,230
show?
Two years ago.

1989
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:26,230
Three years ago,
something like that.

1990
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:27,920
Really say about two years ago.
Three years ago.

1991
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:30,860
Was it an issue or what is it?
You had a special guest that.

1992
01:28:30,861 --> 01:28:33,080
What was it you think?
I don't know.

1993
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,620
It's momentum.
Just over time.

1994
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,730
Just,
just always.

1995
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,010
Just constantly doing it.
Grinding,

1996
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,070
being in here,
delivering on three or four days a week.

1997
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:43,930
Yeah.
You,

1998
01:28:43,931 --> 01:28:46,190
you do your best.
Do your best.

1999
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:47,870
Get better at it.
Make mistakes,

2000
01:28:47,871 --> 01:28:49,850
apologize for your mistakes.
Keep going.

2001
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,220
Because when I.
When I did your show last time,

2002
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:57,221
I just in my head ever since like I 
always like you are doing what I want to

2003
01:28:59,451 --> 01:29:00,260
do.
Like you don't.

2004
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:02,040
I loved what I go,
Joe Doe because

2005
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,480
people always try and discredit men.
No,

2006
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,290
know how I got into a position where I 
have to worry about being discredited.

2007
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:10,290
I'm a fucking nightclub Jaguar comedian 
and afterward,

2008
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:13,020
that's why you're like,
I don't have to cage fighting.

2009
01:29:13,021 --> 01:29:14,970
I spoke the pod.
I'm not a reputable person.

2010
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,210
I was like,
I want to be.

2011
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:21,210
You want to be who I want to be.
I'm at a reputable person,

2012
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,710
go fuck you.
You know,

2013
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:25,170
I do my best to be honest.
You know,

2014
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:28,350
I mean,
I approach issues and in an honest way,

2015
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:30,600
but I'm not your source of reason,
but you know what I mean?

2016
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,490
I'm not,
I'm not that guy.

2017
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:37,491
I want to be a provocateur.
I want to be the guy in the outside 

2018
01:29:37,491 --> 01:29:37,491
throwing spitballs that's,
that's who I want to be doing.

2019
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,800
I am doing that.
Somehow I got caught up in this thing 

2020
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,530
where people are going to try to 
discredit you.

2021
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,330
Goddamn it.
It's so.

2022
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,250
I'm confused.
I'm confused by this,

2023
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:55,251
this Alex Jones thing,
because although I don't support a lot 

2024
01:29:55,251 --> 01:29:58,290
of the things that he said,
I don't know why more people don't think

2025
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:03,291
that this could be a real problem,
that they could just throw that hate 

2026
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:06,411
speech blanket on things and if I didn't
have that experience of talking to that 

2027
01:30:06,411 --> 01:30:08,220
woman was,
she was describing the Douglas Murray,

2028
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:12,870
Sam Harris' podcast,
which doesn't have a single slur.

2029
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:16,650
It is no hateful rhetoric mean.
It's not hate speech.

2030
01:30:16,651 --> 01:30:19,530
I listened to it.
It's just a description.

2031
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,630
I mean it's,
it's a discussion rather.

2032
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,610
So you have that insight.
I know.

2033
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:27,780
I know how calmly and confidently she 
said it's hate speech.

2034
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:29,100
It was like,
you know what it was like,

2035
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:32,430
do you remember those old commercials 
where um,

2036
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:37,520
there was a guy and he was eating with 
another guy and he was saying that if 

2037
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:37,920
you buy drugs,
you support terrorism.

2038
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:39,120
Yes.
Like what do you mean?

2039
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,110
He's like,
it's a fact.

2040
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:43,320
It's just a fact.
If act fact and he's eating a salad,

2041
01:30:43,321 --> 01:30:45,780
he's a no nonsense guy.
Fact honey,

2042
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,630
what do you mean its effect?
Its effect.

2043
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:50,220
If Act fact,
you buy pot,

2044
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,500
you're supporting terrorism,
but it's basically what you said.

2045
01:30:52,501 --> 01:30:57,501
It's hate speech.
It's basically the same sort of self 

2046
01:30:57,501 --> 01:30:57,501
righteous indignation.
Yeah.

2047
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:59,070
Yeah.
Where she didn't,

2048
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:03,240
but when I was pressing her on it,
it was almost like she was my boss and I

2049
01:31:03,241 --> 01:31:04,350
couldn't talk to her about.
I'm like,

2050
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,320
I don't work for you.
Do you understand that this kind of,

2051
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:10,800
this method of communication that you're
accustomed to,

2052
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:13,440
this does not apply here you.
You have to.

2053
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:18,500
You have to discuss these ideas.
I want to know the merit of your 

2054
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:18,500
thoughts.
You know,

2055
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,790
I want to see where you,
where your thought process laws that you

2056
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:24,060
could just throw this hate speech 
blanket on things and it turns out there

2057
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:26,130
was no thought and there was no 
consideration.

2058
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:31,130
There was no examination.
She didn't know the content of the 

2059
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:33,711
conversation and her confidence in 
saying that it was hate speech was 

2060
01:31:33,711 --> 01:31:37,910
merely towing the company line.
The same company line that got James 

2061
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:39,810
Damore fired for the Google memo.
You know,

2062
01:31:39,811 --> 01:31:44,811
you,
you talked to actual evolutionary 

2063
01:31:44,811 --> 01:31:47,151
biologists and people understand 
psychology and people who are clinical 

2064
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:51,300
psychologists will talk to you about the
real differences between men and women.

2065
01:31:51,301 --> 01:31:53,660
Would he actually said in these 
documents where he's.

2066
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:58,940
He didn't make some sort of a 
quantitative like like a ruling that 

2067
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:05,730
women are less valuable or that women 
are worth less money or that women are 

2068
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:09,460
in somehow in any way,
shape or form inferior.

2069
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:14,790
He simply wrote about clinical studies 
that have shown tendencies to gravitate 

2070
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:20,550
towards different professions and even 
had a page and a half in that about how 

2071
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:24,220
there's ways that we could encourage 
more women to get into tech,

2072
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:24,780
so it was.

2073
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,490
It was not negative in any way towards 
women,

2074
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:32,520
but I saw all these people describing it
as hateful rhetoric and then that it was

2075
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:37,620
reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.
Like what with actual studies,

2076
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,220
actual studies of science.
Those are real.

2077
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:46,350
These are harmful gender stereotypes 
because they don't add up to your vision

2078
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:51,570
of Narnia diversity that you did that 
only exists in Wakanda and some cloud 

2079
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:53,610
somewhere that you.
You've.

2080
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:56,170
You've put up.
These are not real numbers.

2081
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:59,950
There's reasons why people gravitate 
towards certain professions.

2082
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:03,130
Some of them are cultural,
some of them are biological.

2083
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:08,250
They're fascinating to study,
but it doesn't mean that a person who 

2084
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:12,781
becomes a nurse is any better than a 
person who becomes a carpenter or vice 

2085
01:33:12,781 --> 01:33:17,221
or a guy who becomes a surgeon is any 
better than someone who becomes a 

2086
01:33:17,221 --> 01:33:17,830
computer coder.
This is not what anyone's saying.

2087
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:23,190
What they're saying is there's reasons 
why people find different things 

2088
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:27,541
interesting and some of them might be 
the amount of testosterone they have in 

2089
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:27,910
their system and the fact they have x,
y chromosomes,

2090
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:33,120
their their genetic history that the 
history of their family and the culture 

2091
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:38,011
that they grew up and there's all these 
variables and these variables are 

2092
01:33:38,011 --> 01:33:39,310
fascinating,
but as soon as you say that,

2093
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,430
these variables must even out at the 
end,

2094
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:45,850
we must have an equality of outcome 
based on gender,

2095
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:47,020
based on race.

2096
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:52,170
Well,
you're not even talking about people 

2097
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:53,941
anymore.
Now you're just talking about something 

2098
01:33:53,941 --> 01:33:56,281
that you need to say in order for you to
keep your job because you want to keep 

2099
01:33:56,281 --> 01:34:00,931
collecting ones and Zeros and you 
understand that there's this confusion 

2100
01:34:00,931 --> 01:34:01,900
as to why there's not more women that 
are leaders.

2101
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:03,970
Why there's not more women that are in 
tech.

2102
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:05,510
Why there's not more this.
More that.

2103
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,420
Why don't you really want to concentrate
on diversity.

2104
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:10,060
You really want to concentrate on a 
fairness concentrated why they're trying

2105
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,280
to keep agents out of Harvard.
How about that?

2106
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:15,370
Because that's some real fucking racism 
that's going on right now.

2107
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:18,760
No one's saying a word about it because 
it's about people that are kicking ass.

2108
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:21,130
They're kicking ass too hard,
so they're trying to.

2109
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,640
They're trying to make it more 
difficult.

2110
01:34:22,641 --> 01:34:27,641
There's a giant class action lawsuit.
Asians are suing Harvard because it's 

2111
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:28,810
more difficult for them to get in than 
anybody else.

2112
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:31,170
Well,
when I was a kid,

2113
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:33,660
I was told that they pee,
pee in your coke,

2114
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:37,860
and that's the Chinese show.
Now I grew up.

2115
01:34:37,861 --> 01:34:40,050
I know that's bullshit.
That's just a thing that they would tell

2116
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:40,890
us.
Little Kids,

2117
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:43,170
little kids.
Just say that that's all it is,

2118
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:49,060
but it's like Joe St Joe to,
to the Charles Murray chat with the.

2119
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:53,280
The antidote to that isn't to censor 
them.

2120
01:34:53,281 --> 01:34:57,480
The antidote to that is good speech.
More speech wasn't even if you wanted to

2121
01:34:57,481 --> 01:35:00,230
be whatever is person to put it on their
playlist,

2122
01:35:00,231 --> 01:35:05,231
which is crazy.
Somebody got a community guideline 

2123
01:35:05,231 --> 01:35:05,231
strike for putting it on their playlist.
I,

2124
01:35:05,231 --> 01:35:09,080
that's why I say we need to have it be 
the youtube,

2125
01:35:09,081 --> 01:35:11,030
facebook.
These are public utilities.

2126
01:35:11,031 --> 01:35:14,390
They need to be regulated and there's no
way.

2127
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:15,830
There's no getting around it.
Right.

2128
01:35:15,831 --> 01:35:19,220
They have super control in our culture.
They have massive impact.

2129
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,810
But so to CBS.
Right.

2130
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,450
So if you say something and CBS fires 
you,

2131
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:28,900
is that illegal?
Isn't it funny that Les Moonves is 

2132
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,130
getting in trouble for some he did to an
actress instead of in the eighties?

2133
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:36,190
Yeah.
And instead of him being a long time 

2134
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:36,190
ago,
was it the eighties?

2135
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,830
I think it was at least 20 years ago.
So 1996 with the one.

2136
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:40,400
Oh,
was it?

2137
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:41,030
Yeah.
Okay.

2138
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:42,640
So that's still a long time.
Yeah.

2139
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,090
So the eighties was,
um,

2140
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:47,690
I'm sorry,
that was confusing that with your,

2141
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:50,300
you're thinking of Sylvester stallone.
No,

2142
01:35:50,301 --> 01:35:52,850
I wasn't thinking.
I was thinking as George.

2143
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:54,830
Oh,
George Psychiatry,

2144
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:58,250
some guy popped out from the 85,
said he grabbed his deck,

2145
01:35:58,251 --> 01:35:58,640
like,
Hey,

2146
01:35:58,641 --> 01:36:01,430
let it go buddy.
Jesus Christ.

2147
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:04,510
You know,
it's uh,

2148
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,450
it's also,
it's not the,

2149
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,520
you know,
there was a molester at my church.

2150
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:09,850
We had a priest that was a molester 
named father hollow.

2151
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:12,170
Shocker.
Wait a minute.

2152
01:36:12,171 --> 01:36:14,000
Is it a Catholic Church?
Shocker.

2153
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:17,030
What the fuck man,
you can't trust anybody.

2154
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,930
And the kids,
we used to call them happy hands Holahan

2155
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:23,240
because he would always cry because 
whatever you come up,

2156
01:36:23,241 --> 01:36:25,460
he'd always like to wrestle you.
But he was the last kind of guy.

2157
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:26,740
He was a nerd.
He was,

2158
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:29,090
he was,
he's not a wrestling type guy,

2159
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:32,090
but he wasn't a rapist trying.
He'd always come up like,

2160
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:32,610
hey,
how am I?

2161
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,880
Like,
why are you doing?

2162
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,320
You're just trying to grab me.
And so we would call them happy hands,

2163
01:36:36,321 --> 01:36:38,660
Holihan,
and we would get in trouble if,

2164
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:43,750
if they,
if our parents heard us that don't get 

2165
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:43,750
disrespectful to be like,
you know,

2166
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:43,750
he's grabbing our dicks.

2167
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:48,770
So they finally,
they finally caught him and I don't know

2168
01:36:48,771 --> 01:36:51,260
why I started talking about this,
but uh,

2169
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:53,540
yeah,
why did I start talking about this?

2170
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,270
And I know because we're talking about,
I always,

2171
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,880
we always had,
we always thought it was like it was up 

2172
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:05,891
to you to not get molested by him.
Like if you got costs and we would 

2173
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:07,410
laugh.
We would laugh at kids who got caught at

2174
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:08,280
it,
got less kids.

2175
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:11,120
So we got to run faster.
Fucker.

2176
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:14,300
He would take,
he would take us.

2177
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:19,301
He had a,
a summerhouse right with a boat and up 

2178
01:37:19,301 --> 01:37:19,301
in Wisconsin,
right.

2179
01:37:19,301 --> 01:37:21,260
So he would take us and it was like an 
hour and a half away.

2180
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:26,261
We get in his station wagon,
he take like six boys up to there and 

2181
01:37:26,261 --> 01:37:26,660
we're going to go water skiing or 
whatever.

2182
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,760
Right.
And um,

2183
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:31,640
so he had the day setup where he,
once you got there,

2184
01:37:31,641 --> 01:37:36,641
you had to first do cleaning,
so you had to change into your cleaning 

2185
01:37:36,641 --> 01:37:36,641
clothes and.

2186
01:37:36,641 --> 01:37:37,190
Yeah.
Oh Jeez.

2187
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,200
And so every time we had to go into the 
room and change,

2188
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:41,450
he would find a reason to come into the 
room and wrestle one of us.

2189
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,370
Oh God.
And then.

2190
01:37:43,371 --> 01:37:44,120
But we were like,
all right,

2191
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:45,800
we got to put up with it because we want
to go onto the boat,

2192
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:46,640
you know,
we were poor.

2193
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,910
Oh my God,
poor.

2194
01:37:49,911 --> 01:37:50,420
You know,
we grew up.

2195
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:52,910
Isn't it funny how it's only funny if 
it's you,

2196
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:56,160
like you're allowed to laugh about 
getting to last as long as it's,

2197
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,350
you know,
like no one could say like,

2198
01:37:58,351 --> 01:37:59,040
you like,
he.

2199
01:37:59,260 --> 01:37:59,870
Well,
he,

2200
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,750
Jimmy was on the Joe Rogan show when he 
was laughing about child molestation.

2201
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:04,680
Oh my God.
Was that,

2202
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:06,600
is that true?
Eight speech.

2203
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:09,150
Put the blanket on it.
Hate speech.

2204
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:09,900
But no,
it was,

2205
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,960
he was,
he was talking about him getting 

2206
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:14,960
molested.
Well,

2207
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,730
he's normalizing sexual assault.
He would take us.

2208
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:19,750
This priest would try to teach you how 
to ski.

2209
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:21,560
Know How do you teach someone how to 
water ski?

2210
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:23,700
You put your Dick in their mouth for 
your Dick in the mouth.

2211
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:30,090
Do you know how to breathe under water 
now?

2212
01:38:30,091 --> 01:38:33,780
Hold your nose.
No spitting.

2213
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:39,770
So he,
the way you teach them what a water 

2214
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:42,201
skis,
you put water skis out and then when 

2215
01:38:42,201 --> 01:38:42,201
they sit there on the dock and you pull 
away,

2216
01:38:42,201 --> 01:38:42,201
right?
Uh,

2217
01:38:42,201 --> 01:38:45,360
and that's how you learn.
So he would take us in shallow water and

2218
01:38:45,361 --> 01:38:50,361
then he would go,
it would put the skis on you so you 

2219
01:38:50,361 --> 01:38:51,570
couldn't run away from him.
And then he would like put his hands.

2220
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:55,440
He would put his hands underneath your 
crotch like this from to pick you up.

2221
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:56,960
And then he goes,
now when the boat pulls it's gonna,

2222
01:38:56,980 --> 01:39:01,290
pull you up like this and it's going to,
it's good that jerk you off and the only

2223
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:02,910
way to kill you gotta catch it in your 
mouth.

2224
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,760
And so it was a fuck man.
And so we looked at it like it was your 

2225
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,480
job to get out of that situation.
If you got caught,

2226
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:14,280
we all laughed at you.
I remember my friend,

2227
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:16,960
my friend Danny,
he's in the,

2228
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:22,410
he's in the shallow water and he's 
gotten off the boat,

2229
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:23,920
pulls you,
and he goes like this,

2230
01:39:23,921 --> 01:39:28,921
and Danny looks at his dad and he goes,
he goes in front of everybody and we're 

2231
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:34,830
laughing,
laughing.

2232
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,470
Now.
Did he actually molest anyone other than

2233
01:39:37,850 --> 01:39:39,660
inappropriate touching,
molested people?

2234
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:44,690
Oh boy.
He had to leave the church and all that 

2235
01:39:44,690 --> 01:39:46,851
stuff.
He believe the church that he's moving 

2236
01:39:46,851 --> 01:39:47,400
moved.
He went to Arizona for a sabbatical.

2237
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2238
01:39:48,391 --> 01:39:49,830
He's.
He needs our prayers that this.

2239
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,840
They sent out a note,
a letter to everybody's house and who 

2240
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:54,840
was in the poof.
You gave money.

2241
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,180
They give you a letter.
Did hear no evil.

2242
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:58,100
The documentary where they,
you know,

2243
01:39:58,101 --> 01:40:03,101
there was one priest that benedict who 
became the pope moved who went onto 

2244
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:07,160
molesta hundred deaf kids.
Oh No.

2245
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:08,800
Oh No.
Yeah.

2246
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,570
Horrific.
Horrific Shit.

2247
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:11,500
That,
that,

2248
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:16,780
that process of moving people was always
terrifying because they basically let 

2249
01:40:18,501 --> 01:40:19,610
them know,
hey,

2250
01:40:19,611 --> 01:40:21,200
you're not even going to be punished for
this.

2251
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:22,160
We're just going to move.
Yeah,

2252
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,250
just gonna move you.
Yeah,

2253
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:24,680
we do.
Yeah,

2254
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:25,860
it doesn't.
I know it.

2255
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:29,750
I don't understand aerifying terrifying 
stuff.

2256
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:34,930
Yeah.
Why isn't the FBI infiltrate the 

2257
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:34,930
Catholic Church?
Yeah.

2258
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:34,930
Imagine I,
I did a joke about onstage while back,

2259
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:38,330
it was like,
imagine if that many nascar drivers were

2260
01:40:38,331 --> 01:40:41,180
fucking kids.
How quick would they shut down Nascar?

2261
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:46,240
Nascar pulled into town,
just fucked all the kids and drove 

2262
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:46,240
around in a circle real quick.
They'd be like,

2263
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,030
we gotta shut this down.
This is a crazy organized,

2264
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:52,030
but meanwhile way more people getting 
molested by the Catholic Church.

2265
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:53,080
I,
I couldn't agree.

2266
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,280
And it's a terrifying

2267
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:57,250
number when you look at the numbers of 
people that have just accused them of,

2268
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:00,370
of sexual assault and molestation.
It's terrifying.

2269
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:01,930
Yeah,
it's terrifying.

2270
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:06,931
And now the money they take that you 
give them on Sunday to go pay these 

2271
01:41:06,931 --> 01:41:06,931
people off is also.
Yeah.

2272
01:41:06,931 --> 01:41:08,470
I feel very fortunate that I ducked 
that.

2273
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:10,150
I got lucky.
What was that?

2274
01:41:10,151 --> 01:41:12,880
A Catholic school you went to Catholic 
school for one year.

2275
01:41:12,881 --> 01:41:16,810
Only first grade.
I was gone after first grade and uh,

2276
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,660
you know,
I had friends that stayed in,

2277
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:21,040
I know new people that got touched,
you know,

2278
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:22,210
it's just,
it's,

2279
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:25,390
it's for people who outside the Catholic
faith,

2280
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:30,420
people who are.
There's something that happened and it 

2281
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:34,051
probably happened when they told them 
they couldn't get married anymore 

2282
01:41:34,051 --> 01:41:34,190
because it used to be the pope could get
married.

2283
01:41:34,191 --> 01:41:39,191
The pope was allowed to have children 
and that priests were allowed to be 

2284
01:41:39,191 --> 01:41:39,191
married.

2285
01:41:39,191 --> 01:41:41,020
Priests were allowed to have children,
but they were rock stars.

2286
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,930
You have to realize like back in the 
Lutheran days,

2287
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:47,470
the days of Martin Luther and those,
those guys were fucking everybody.

2288
01:41:47,890 --> 01:41:52,250
They would get you in that confession,
in the confession with him,

2289
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:54,580
what you did to Delores,
Delores,

2290
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:59,670
they're just sucking dicks all day has 
shown me I sucked at Dolores when they 

2291
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:03,390
were banging everybody and then they 
came up with some sort of a reason why 

2292
01:42:03,521 --> 01:42:06,160
they should have to be celibate.
And from then on,

2293
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:07,280
well,
so here's what happened.

2294
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:09,610
Here's what I heard was what happened 
was that.

2295
01:42:09,611 --> 01:42:12,910
So there was two ways to become nobility
and the Bonnyville Times.

2296
01:42:12,911 --> 01:42:17,911
You could be born noble or you could buy
your way into the church and so you 

2297
01:42:17,951 --> 01:42:22,951
could become nobility and so what would 
happen is these rich motherfuckers who 

2298
01:42:22,951 --> 01:42:23,650
would buy the witness of the Church 
would die and then all their money would

2299
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:24,370
go to their kid.

2300
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,770
Their first born in the church is like,
we've got to get some.

2301
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:29,980
We got to get our hands on that money.
And so they passed the law.

2302
01:42:29,981 --> 01:42:31,720
Hey,
nobody can get married legally.

2303
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,840
They all did.
They still had kids and shit and they 

2304
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:36,840
still had mistresses and whatever,
but when they died,

2305
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,560
all their money and property went to the
church.

2306
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,810
That makes sense.
And so of course it's all about.

2307
01:42:40,811 --> 01:42:41,920
But.
So that's the story I heard.

2308
01:42:41,921 --> 01:42:43,410
If,
if anybody heard different levels,

2309
01:42:43,411 --> 01:42:44,950
it's both a bed,
it's a bed.

2310
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:49,951
It had something to do with sex as well 
and preventing those guys from fucking 

2311
01:42:49,951 --> 01:42:50,470
everybody you know,
because they were rock stars.

2312
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:55,471
There was no rock stars back then.
So the guys that were the spokespersons 

2313
01:42:55,471 --> 01:42:59,100
for God would most likely be the ones 
who had the most influence in the 

2314
01:42:59,100 --> 01:42:59,100
community.
I mean,

2315
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:04,130
he's a kid that we went to school with 
who was a clearly gay and a nice guy and

2316
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:08,140
he was going to become a priest when we 
were all in high school together.

2317
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:11,230
So as we were like riding the bus,
going to high school,

2318
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:16,320
he was a couple of years ahead of me and
he was a leaving school and he was 

2319
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:21,121
already on his way.
What does it divinity school or 

2320
01:43:21,121 --> 01:43:21,121
seminary,
seminary,

2321
01:43:21,121 --> 01:43:21,121
anything.
Yeah.

2322
01:43:21,121 --> 01:43:25,240
He was on his way and we were all like,
we're all calling him father already and

2323
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:30,241
it was just ridiculous.
We're all accepting the fact this guy 

2324
01:43:30,241 --> 01:43:30,241
was going to be a priest,
but you know,

2325
01:43:30,241 --> 01:43:34,300
for him it was.
He was so obviously gay that,

2326
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,560
you know,
I mean,

2327
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:39,670
I didn't give a shit,
but I knew you could tell these gay.

2328
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:42,010
He's a gay guy.
He never had any interest in girls.

2329
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,350
Never was around them.
Kind of a,

2330
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:50,130
just an oddly feminine man and uh,
decided to take up the priesthood and we

2331
01:43:50,741 --> 01:43:52,100
all treated him

2332
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,760
like he was different because he was 
going to become

2333
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:56,340
priest is very weird.
Yeah.

2334
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:59,850
The know priests are still treated like 
rock stars in the Catholic Church today.

2335
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:00,720
Yeah.
And he was.

2336
01:44:00,721 --> 01:44:04,110
Meanwhile I was just another 16 year old
kid just like us,

2337
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,560
you know,
maybe he was 17 at the time and I think 

2338
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:09,560
I was 15,
but it was just,

2339
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:13,281
he wasn't a different than us,
but we were calling him father and 

2340
01:44:13,281 --> 01:44:13,281
stuff.

2341
01:44:13,281 --> 01:44:15,880
It was just so strange.
I had two uncles that went to seminary.

2342
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:19,570
One of them became a priest and the 
other one,

2343
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:24,660
uh,
over the summer I had a friend who got 

2344
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:25,870
pregnant and he had to stop being,
get dropped out of the seminary.

2345
01:44:25,930 --> 01:44:30,930
Wow.
But when you went to my grandmother's 

2346
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:31,450
house as you walked up the steps into 
their living room,

2347
01:44:31,451 --> 01:44:36,451
the two pictures she would have greeting
you was a picture of both her sons in 

2348
01:44:36,451 --> 01:44:38,530
their priest outfit.
So one was actually a priest and one had

2349
01:44:38,531 --> 01:44:41,200
to go,
but that's the picture she kept up.

2350
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,210
Right guys bring it over his four kids 
to her house.

2351
01:44:43,211 --> 01:44:45,770
There's the picture of Daddy,
why are you in the priest outfit?

2352
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:49,220
One point in time.
So,

2353
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,410
so yeah.
That's,

2354
01:44:50,411 --> 01:44:51,340
um,
are you,

2355
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:52,960
are you still religious?
You still go to church?

2356
01:44:52,961 --> 01:44:53,840
No.
Okay.

2357
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:54,920
No,
I,

2358
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,920
I go because my,
I go to church,

2359
01:44:56,921 --> 01:45:00,760
a Baptist Church in Pasadena because my,
my mother in law goes and she wanted,

2360
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:01,800
she asked me to go,
oh,

2361
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,310
that's probably fun.
And I said,

2362
01:45:03,311 --> 01:45:03,910
okay,
I'll go.

2363
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:07,240
I'm being protested by the Westboro 
Baptist Church tomorrow are.

2364
01:45:07,241 --> 01:45:09,850
You were in Kansas City.
Oh,

2365
01:45:09,851 --> 01:45:10,660
very excited.
Oh,

2366
01:45:10,661 --> 01:45:11,290
that is.
Ah,

2367
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:13,600
I've always wanted to be protesting is 
good for you

2368
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:16,920
press release.
And they even responded to my,

2369
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:17,610
my,
uh,

2370
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:22,611
I put out a post and they had a tweet,
someone who has no idea what God wants 

2371
01:45:22,611 --> 01:45:24,840
to speak and forgot that I said that if 
God,

2372
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,890
you know,
there is a god.

2373
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,540
They said I was an atheist,
which I,

2374
01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:29,430
I'm really not.
I mean,

2375
01:45:29,431 --> 01:45:33,870
I don't consider myself anything.
I don't consider myself religious.

2376
01:45:33,990 --> 01:45:36,780
I'm not an atheist.
I'm just a person who doesn't know.

2377
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,650
And I don't call it gnostic.
I think I'm more agnostic than anything,

2378
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,270
but I don't even want to put a label on 
it.

2379
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,530
Why should I have to be someone's camp?
You know,

2380
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:51,160
my,
my opinions are allowed to evolve and 

2381
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:51,160
I'm allowed to and I've done a lot of 
drugs.

2382
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,950
I've seen some shit that I can't 
explain,

2383
01:45:52,951 --> 01:45:54,060
you know,
and psychedelics,

2384
01:45:54,061 --> 01:45:56,850
man will,
they'll get whatever confidence you have

2385
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:57,750
that there's no god.

2386
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,020
You go through a dmt trip and you come 
out and the other and you're like,

2387
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:06,080
okay,
maybe I don't know what the fuck I'm 

2388
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,761
talking about.
Maybe I don't know anything and that's 

2389
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:07,761
I'm in the maybe I don't know anything 
camp.

2390
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:10,430
So I said that if where there was a god,
I don't know if there's a god,

2391
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:15,431
but if there was a god,
he or she would probably very 

2392
01:46:15,431 --> 01:46:18,771
disappointed these hateful twats pretend
to speak for him putting up signs and 

2393
01:46:18,771 --> 01:46:18,990
say,
God hates fags.

2394
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,420
Like you really think this is what God 
would want.

2395
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:26,480
That's outrageous.
And so that's what they're excited 

2396
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:26,480
about.
That you said that,

2397
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:26,480
that I speak for God.
Oh,

2398
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:29,000
but they could speak for good.
They see God hates fags taking.

2399
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:34,030
See that written anywhere?
Look to the Bible never says God hates 

2400
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:36,861
fags.
That's their website is God hates 

2401
01:46:36,861 --> 01:46:37,290
fags.com.
Just stop and think about that.

2402
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:39,060
I think they should take their facebook 
page away.

2403
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:40,680
Do they have a youtube channel?

2404
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:42,920
Westboro Baptist Church.
I have a youtube channel,

2405
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:45,890
but yeah,
but don't.

2406
01:46:45,891 --> 01:46:50,891
Don't use speech.
Don't you think we're living in a weird 

2407
01:46:50,891 --> 01:46:54,501
era of like people wanting to just 
discredit people just like get rid of 

2408
01:46:57,001 --> 01:46:57,480
them.
Like,

2409
01:46:57,481 --> 01:46:58,320
oh you,
you,

2410
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:03,800
you don't believe this.
One thing that the establishment says 

2411
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,411
you have to.
There's only one narrative on this 

2412
01:47:06,411 --> 01:47:06,411
Syrian war and if you go,
if you go away from it,

2413
01:47:06,411 --> 01:47:08,670
you're,
you're a bad person and you're alive and

2414
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:10,710
you're a,
you're an apologist for Assad and you're

2415
01:47:10,711 --> 01:47:12,150
a Putin puppet at all.
It's like,

2416
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:12,900
what the fuck?
No,

2417
01:47:12,901 --> 01:47:17,730
I just have a different view on the war 
and it's based on facts and evidence and

2418
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:22,731
I don't know if you know,
but those people you're trusting now 

2419
01:47:22,731 --> 01:47:22,731
were the ones who continuously lied to 
us.

2420
01:47:22,731 --> 01:47:24,120
So I've never lied to you about a war.
You're,

2421
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:28,590
you're upset because I'm skeptical of 
the people who constantly lie about war.

2422
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:33,880
It's just the.
And so that's just a weird thing and 

2423
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,871
it's like this.
But I guess it's probably always been 

2424
01:47:35,871 --> 01:47:35,871
this way,
Joe.

2425
01:47:35,871 --> 01:47:35,871
I don't know,
I just,

2426
01:47:35,871 --> 01:47:39,080
now that I'm experienced it because I'm 
in the public talking about this stuff 

2427
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:42,650
and it's just weird how people are so 
quick to go along with the 

2428
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:45,681
establishment,
look at how the lefties are defending 

2429
01:47:45,681 --> 01:47:48,081
the intelligence community.
Wishing Robert Muller of fucking happy 

2430
01:47:48,081 --> 01:47:48,081
birthday on twitter,
like a bunch of idiots.

2431
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:50,790
So ridiculous.
It's like,

2432
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:54,060
do you guys have any sense of history?
Do you have any sense of recent history?

2433
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:55,860
No,
it's just,

2434
01:47:55,950 --> 01:48:00,950
it's,
it shows you how the hatred of someone 

2435
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:03,321
could make people's lizard brains 
excited and then rational thinking goes 

2436
01:48:03,321 --> 01:48:03,321
out.
The.

2437
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:06,390
So I love amplicon on my show says,
you know,

2438
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:08,100
uh,
I hate trump as much as anybody,

2439
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,890
but I'm not going to let them steal my 
critical thinking skills.

2440
01:48:10,891 --> 01:48:15,891
And so that's the site.
And so the thing that I like about what 

2441
01:48:15,891 --> 01:48:15,960
our show does,
we're very consistent.

2442
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:21,170
I don't have one set of rules first.
People I like and another set of rules 

2443
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:21,170
for people I have opposed.

2444
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:23,280
And I really,
really appreciate that about you.

2445
01:48:23,281 --> 01:48:28,281
And that's one of the things that I said
about you the first time we came on and 

2446
01:48:28,281 --> 01:48:28,530
say you shoot straight no matter whether
it's right or left,

2447
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:29,760
whatever you see,
you call it,

2448
01:48:29,761 --> 01:48:31,860
like you see it.
There's no partisan politics.

2449
01:48:31,861 --> 01:48:36,861
And I think that's very important.
And it's so rare it doesn't exist 

2450
01:48:36,861 --> 01:48:36,861
anymore.
You know,

2451
01:48:36,861 --> 01:48:41,271
it was,
I was watching or listening rather than 

2452
01:48:41,271 --> 01:48:41,430
Sam Harris is one of his podcasts 
recently.

2453
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:46,730
Whereas guests made a really important 
point saying that we're in this strange 

2454
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:50,181
time in history where the news is 
different depending on what channel you 

2455
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:55,671
watch.
It used to be you at different people 

2456
01:48:55,671 --> 01:48:58,550
telling you the news,
now you have different news if you 

2457
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:58,740
totally different,
totally different news.

2458
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,200
Isn't that something?
And it's completely partisan.

2459
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:06,230
I mean it's,
it's 100 percent left or 100 percent 

2460
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:06,230
right?

2461
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:07,650
And you're either all in with us.
And I feel like what we're talking about

2462
01:49:07,651 --> 01:49:10,680
here and what you're describing is idea 
sports like this,

2463
01:49:10,681 --> 01:49:13,140
this,
this needing to shut people down.

2464
01:49:13,141 --> 01:49:15,000
They want to get a result.
They want to win the game.

2465
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:20,270
You know what?
Right now they just slam dunked on Alex 

2466
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:20,270
Jones and they're high fiving all around
the coffee shop.

2467
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:22,590
All the Baristas are fucking psyched.
You know,

2468
01:49:22,591 --> 01:49:27,591
they're,
they're really excited to make an 

2469
01:49:27,591 --> 01:49:27,591
espresso.
Yeah,

2470
01:49:27,591 --> 01:49:29,511
we shut them down,
we fucking shut them down and we're 

2471
01:49:29,511 --> 01:49:30,600
gonna put our masks and our bike locks 
are going to whack.

2472
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:32,010
Trump supporters are in the head 
tonight.

2473
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:36,180
Like this is is a strange time for 
ideas.

2474
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,680
You can't,
you can't even,

2475
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:42,950
you can't even objectively assess the 
merits of an idea because the ideas have

2476
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:47,950
already been clearly delineated.
Very clearly

2477
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:53,040
acceptable,
acceptable parameters of this 

2478
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:53,710
conversation.
These are the acceptable ideas.

2479
01:49:53,711 --> 01:49:56,650
And if you go over them,
you are persona non grata.

2480
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:58,020
Yeah.
That's it.

2481
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:00,700
And you know,
meanwhile you turn on NBC,

2482
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:02,160
it's just littered with liars.

2483
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:07,200
Yeah.
And so is Fox and of course you know 

2484
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,330
what I'd love Shepard Smith.
Shep Smith.

2485
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:13,380
He is a fascinating character.
When he is doing over there is going 

2486
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:16,640
against everything.
He goes to get like the.

2487
01:50:16,641 --> 01:50:20,930
You ever seen the what Sean Hannity says
versus Shepard Smith?

2488
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,280
Yeah.
I've seen those videos.

2489
01:50:22,281 --> 01:50:24,470
Fucking hilarious.
Pretty funny.

2490
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:27,040
And he's right.
And he's not right.

2491
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:28,580
He's right.
Constitutionally,

2492
01:50:28,581 --> 01:50:33,581
like what he's saying,
when he's describing what Sean Hannity 

2493
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:34,520
said versus the reality.
He's right.

2494
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:39,210
He's right in terms of what is a law.
He's right in terms of what you know,

2495
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:42,410
whether or not something is legal or 
whether or not it's unethical.

2496
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:43,550
Yeah.
And

2497
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:45,670
you know that that's the thing about 
Shep Smith,

2498
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:47,220
like,
uh,

2499
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:52,230
when he gets something wrong,
I think he's just genuinely getting it 

2500
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:55,321
wrong.
I don't think it's because he's trying 

2501
01:50:55,321 --> 01:50:55,321
to push it in there.
He,

2502
01:50:55,321 --> 01:50:55,420
he might be unconsciously been 
corrupted,

2503
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:57,550
but not consciously.
How did he get over there?

2504
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,230
Was the over there?
I don't,

2505
01:50:59,231 --> 01:51:00,250
I don't know.
You tell me.

2506
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,530
Do you remember when Hannity was on with
combs?

2507
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:07,531
It was Hannity and colmes took the 
weasel earliest weakest looking liberal.

2508
01:51:08,051 --> 01:51:12,580
They could find a guy.
Looks like he just sweats canola oil and

2509
01:51:12,581 --> 01:51:16,180
they put him on TV opposite like this.
Well,

2510
01:51:16,181 --> 01:51:21,181
Dino right wingers.
You how sean met him right wingers used 

2511
01:51:21,181 --> 01:51:23,911
to hire Alan comes to to come perform at
his parties and he would just cower in 

2512
01:51:23,911 --> 01:51:26,350
the corner.
And I'm kidding.

2513
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,540
I feel bad making fun.
Of Him,

2514
01:51:28,541 --> 01:51:31,020
because he's not alive anymore.
He's not Alan Colmes.

2515
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:32,320
I'm pretty sure he's dead.
Oh,

2516
01:51:32,321 --> 01:51:35,260
when did he die?
A like a year ago or two years ago.

2517
01:51:35,261 --> 01:51:38,110
Can you google that and see if he.
I'm pretty nerdy and him split up.

2518
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:40,180
The band broke up long before that.
Yeah.

2519
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:41,290
Yeah.
It's like crosby,

2520
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:43,630
stills,
Nash and young in February.

2521
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:45,490
Last February last year.
So yeah,

2522
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:47,040
he was.
This guy's very nice guy.

2523
01:51:47,070 --> 01:51:52,070
I'm sure he was a nice guy,
but it was almost like he didn't get 

2524
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,070
riled up on

2525
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:57,160
to keep his job.
He got riled up enough to make liberals 

2526
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,961
look like pushovers and so the people at
home and Kansas and be like stupid 

2527
01:51:59,961 --> 01:52:00,270
liberals.
Yeah.

2528
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:01,800
Sean Hannity's,
my man.

2529
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:04,140
Sean Hannity's got American.
Yes.

2530
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:07,140
You know,
like Sean Hannity with his big fat white

2531
01:52:07,141 --> 01:52:12,141
bread eaten face and that he was just 
the one who is telling the truth about 

2532
01:52:12,141 --> 01:52:15,860
the real problem and the dems in it's.
It's so fascinating to see that video 

2533
01:52:15,991 --> 01:52:20,170
was Shepard Smith just clearly and,
and,

2534
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:20,750
and,
and,

2535
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,900
and very cleanly dissecting everything 
that Hannity says.

2536
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:25,380
Well,
the,

2537
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,310
the ironic part is right here.
Oh yeah,

2538
01:52:27,311 --> 01:52:28,660
that's the video.
Six minutes of it,

2539
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:30,360
and we can't play this though,
right?

2540
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:38,350
There's no evidence to prove any of this
was true after the 18 months.

2541
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,890
The Russian investigation is the 
opposite of a hoax.

2542
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:47,790
Now,
indictments against Russian 

2543
01:52:47,790 --> 01:52:47,790
organizations and persons have been 
handed up.

2544
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:50,060
It's hilarious.
Yeah.

2545
01:52:50,061 --> 01:52:52,400
It goes on and on.
It's a Fox News.

2546
01:52:52,401 --> 01:52:56,780
Shep Smith shuts down.
Sean Hannity's lies and propaganda.

2547
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:59,960
How is,
how is Shep Smith still at Fox News?

2548
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:01,340
How does that work?
Are you telling me?

2549
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,990
It's interesting,
right?

2550
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:03,830
Yeah,
it is.

2551
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:06,710
If this is Sean Hannity's,
eyes look like he's a drugged up.

2552
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:07,850
Yeah,
they're cheesing anchor,

2553
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,110
so on some pills,
Isley,

2554
01:53:09,111 --> 01:53:13,100
he looks like something's wrong.
Who's the chief anchor of their breaking

2555
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:18,101
news division,
but let me tell you about what Sean 

2556
01:53:18,101 --> 01:53:18,680
Hannity has been doing is that woman on 
Alexandria,

2557
01:53:18,681 --> 01:53:23,681
Kazuyo Cortez from New York who beat Joe
Crowley and she's the big democratic 

2558
01:53:23,681 --> 01:53:26,180
socialists and everybody's got their 
bushing and not over it because,

2559
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:31,181
oh my God,
she's the Corporate Democrats hater the 

2560
01:53:31,181 --> 01:53:31,181
right wind.

2561
01:53:31,181 --> 01:53:31,181
She freaks out.
Right?

2562
01:53:31,181 --> 01:53:35,591
Because he's actually going to help 
people and Sean Hannity has been like 

2563
01:53:35,591 --> 01:53:35,591
reading out like that.
Look what she likes.

2564
01:53:35,591 --> 01:53:40,070
She wants to have medicare for all.
She wants to have free college.

2565
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:43,670
She wants to living wage.
She wants to end the war and people.

2566
01:53:43,671 --> 01:53:46,030
I'm sure almost half his audience are 
like,

2567
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:47,630
that sounds looking pretty good.
That's A.

2568
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:52,810
I don't know if you know Sean.
Things are tough out here in the 

2569
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:52,810
heartland.
Is that possible to do all those things?

2570
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:56,850
I don't have to worry about medical 
bills for my fucking kids anymore and I 

2571
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:59,590
tried for that.
I don't have to worry about sending my 

2572
01:53:59,590 --> 01:53:59,590
kids to college.
It's awesome because you have more.

2573
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:01,250
You have endless money for these wars.
I'm sure you have some money for us,

2574
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:03,020
right?
I mean college subsidized,

2575
01:54:03,021 --> 01:54:06,640
like why is it so expensive?
So it actually backfiring.

2576
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:11,650
In fact,
I there was a poll that Fox and friends 

2577
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:13,961
and friends and friends put out that 
said Fox and refresh it.

2578
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:19,620
It said,
do you think the 32 point 

2579
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:19,620
$6,000,000,000,000
for Bernie Sanders Medicare for all plan

2580
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:24,341
is worth it?
Of course they left out the other part 

2581
01:54:24,341 --> 01:54:24,341
which turns out it saves two point 
something trillion dollars,

2582
01:54:24,341 --> 01:54:29,171
right?
That's the part they leave out to their 

2583
01:54:29,171 --> 01:54:30,881
gaslighting and their own viewers,
just like all news organizations have 

2584
01:54:30,881 --> 01:54:30,881
their own viewers.
So they,

2585
01:54:30,881 --> 01:54:35,700
that pole pole went up and 73 percent of
the Fox and friends and friends and 

2586
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:39,701
friends.
Viewers said they want Bernie Sanders 

2587
01:54:39,701 --> 01:54:41,080
Medicare for all 73 percent and 30,000
people voted in that bowl.

2588
01:54:41,081 --> 01:54:42,990
So that's not just nothing.
So I,

2589
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,310
I,
it's,

2590
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:45,910
it's like,
so now they're,

2591
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:51,130
they think that scary socialism scary.
It doesn't scare people anymore because 

2592
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:54,940
now there's the internet.
People can go look what it's like to 

2593
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:54,940
live in Denmark.

2594
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:56,420
Once a license do say,
do you support Communism,

2595
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:58,250
do sport socialism?
Then people say,

2596
01:54:58,251 --> 01:54:58,680
no,
no,

2597
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:02,360
we don't support Communism d support,
medicare yet support social security.

2598
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:04,340
Of course,
for public education.

2599
01:55:04,341 --> 01:55:04,970
Yes.
Okay.

2600
01:55:04,971 --> 01:55:07,650
Are you support public roads?
Are you for the post office?

2601
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:09,000
We,
for the fire department and put.

2602
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:09,660
Yes.
Yes.

2603
01:55:09,670 --> 01:55:11,330
Yes.
This is all socialism.

2604
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,950
Yeah.
You like libraries,

2605
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:18,820
south socialism and good aspects to it 
and so particularly like free health 

2606
01:55:19,111 --> 01:55:21,350
care.
Who the fuck wants someone that you love

2607
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:24,440
to be shit out of luck where they can't 
go to a doctor because they can't afford

2608
01:55:24,441 --> 01:55:26,360
it and what if they die?
Come on.

2609
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:31,390
So when I went to Norway and my friend 
Steve Owen to Norway to and something 

2610
01:55:31,390 --> 01:55:33,470
that he noticed his Norwegian,
oh,

2611
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:38,650
did we ever anyway guys and the guys get
the Fellas,

2612
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:44,310
I've got to tell you,
they do wear comically tight pants.

2613
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:46,260
The guys in Europe,
it's like,

2614
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:47,040
you know,
my wife says,

2615
01:55:47,041 --> 01:55:47,970
it's like,
you know those,

2616
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:51,360
she goes up to the fashion designers are
fucking with you.

2617
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:52,380
You know that,
right?

2618
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,070
It's like,
oh,

2619
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:54,810
I always wanted him to know what your 
keys look like.

2620
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,550
Shrink wrapped.
That's fantastic.

2621
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:04,010
How many comics you see on stage?
You can see what their fucking phone 

2622
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:04,010
make is key.
Oh,

2623
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:04,620
you drive a BMW.
That's nice.

2624
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:06,050
It's like,
what the fuck?

2625
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:10,290
Make sure they can't run away quick.
We have their legs bound up skinny jeans

2626
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:15,291
anyway,
but over there when they talk about a 

2627
01:56:15,291 --> 01:56:15,291
health care we do,
we go,

2628
01:56:15,291 --> 01:56:15,920
you look at you like free healthcare.
They go,

2629
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:20,930
we don't call it free healthcare.
We call it included because it's 

2630
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:24,741
included in your taxes.
Just like just like your public 

2631
01:56:24,741 --> 01:56:24,960
education here,
just like your streets and roads here,

2632
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:26,910
just like your department,
fire department,

2633
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:27,930
your Chi,
it's included.

2634
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:29,610
We don't go.
You get free police,

2635
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:31,050
you get free fire department.
No,

2636
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:36,051
it's included in your Texas road road 
maintenance and so that's the funny 

2637
01:56:36,051 --> 01:56:37,200
thing that Sean Hannity and the right 
wing,

2638
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:38,910
they think they can scare people by 
saying,

2639
01:56:38,911 --> 01:56:39,540
look,
all this stuff,

2640
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:39,840
they're off.

2641
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,810
No.
If the Democrats would have been off,

2642
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:43,950
Hillary Clinton would have been offering
people something,

2643
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:46,860
maybe half the country who didn't vote 
when it came out and voted for her.

2644
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:52,220
So that's the thing you use.
The Democrats have nothing to offer 

2645
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:55,341
people in,
which is why there are a shit show at a 

2646
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:56,190
failed party and they've lost their 
wiped out at every level of government.

2647
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,220
And so if they take over,
it's like if the congress,

2648
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:00,750
there's a big chance to chance they 
might.

2649
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:02,160
Uh,
it's just,

2650
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:02,540
again,
it's,

2651
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:07,580
they're,
they're the ones doing the bidding for 

2652
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:09,321
trump.
They just handed him more money for 

2653
01:57:09,321 --> 01:57:09,321
defense than he even asked for.
So if trump had,

2654
01:57:09,321 --> 01:57:10,110
here's the thing,
here's the funny thing,

2655
01:57:10,111 --> 01:57:12,420
if trump is a maniac,
they'll to say he's unhinged.

2656
01:57:12,421 --> 01:57:17,421
He's a maniac.
Haiti shouldn't have his finger on the 

2657
01:57:17,421 --> 01:57:17,421
button.
Let's give them $80,

2658
01:57:17,421 --> 01:57:17,580
million more dollars for bombs.

2659
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:21,300
Those two things are incongruent.
Those don't go together.

2660
01:57:21,330 --> 01:57:23,670
So you're bullshitting me on one end or 
another.

2661
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,490
Do you think he's going to get through 
this without going to jail?

2662
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,440
He,
um,

2663
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:33,710
yes.
Do you think your son's going to go to 

2664
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:33,710
jail?
I,

2665
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:33,710
you know,
I'm not good at predicting things,

2666
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:37,701
but they should all go to jail because 
they're probably all corrupt doing 

2667
01:57:37,701 --> 01:57:40,670
corrupt shit.
But if you put a special prosecutor on 

2668
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:42,750
anybody I could,
they'll find crimes on anybody you know,

2669
01:57:42,751 --> 01:57:44,580
the,
they're prosecuting manafort for.

2670
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:47,490
It doesn't have anything to do with the 
election or trump's campaign.

2671
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,410
It's all shit.
Before the trump's campaign,

2672
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:53,010
when he was in collusion with Tony,
but that's the from the Podesta group,

2673
01:57:53,011 --> 01:57:58,011
he was funneling money from fucking 
Ukraine and they were giving it through 

2674
01:57:58,011 --> 01:58:00,970
the Podesta found day.
So it is what he's getting charged.

2675
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:06,000
He's,
he's getting charged for shit that 

2676
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:06,000
happened before he ever even worked for 
trump.

2677
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,320
So that's the part they don't tell you.
They go metaphor charge,

2678
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,240
but then 80th paragraph,
they go,

2679
01:58:09,241 --> 01:58:10,680
this has nothing to do with the 
election.

2680
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:15,890
Every articles like that.
So it's just a matter of them deciding 

2681
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:17,860
to put a microscope up your ass and find
things you did wrong.

2682
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:22,160
They put a microscope but Bill Clinton's
ass about some land deal in Arkansas and

2683
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:26,370
ended up going to a blowjob in the oval 
office and he got impeached for it.

2684
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:31,640
So they got rid of the special 
prosecutor after that because they 

2685
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,080
realize that you'll find crimes on 
anybody if you put a special prosecutor.

2686
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:33,610
Um,
and they.

2687
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:35,760
And now they bring it back for trump.
They don't,

2688
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,610
they're not prosecuting literal fucking 
war criminals.

2689
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:41,130
Joe Literal.
We know their war criminals.

2690
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:43,390
There was a thing called the torture 
program.

2691
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:46,360
We know that it was a real thing.
No one goes to jail.

2692
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:48,900
Nobody's prosecuted,
but God dammit,

2693
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:51,670
they got a special prosecutor for trump.
Not that they shouldn't,

2694
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:54,680
but we all know if you put a special 
prosecutor on anybody,

2695
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:59,720
Washington,
they're gonna find a lot of fucking 

2696
01:58:59,720 --> 01:58:59,720
crimes.
Yeah,

2697
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:02,131
they know what they're doing.
That's all the same game of this thing 

2698
01:59:02,131 --> 01:59:02,800
about not registering as four at age and
so they all played the same game.

2699
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:07,950
They don't register as foreign agents 
until they get caught and then the 

2700
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:08,020
government allows them to go backtrack 
and reregister,

2701
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:11,130
but they're not doing that at all.
We're not going to let but metaphor it.

2702
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:12,220
They eat.
He made a mistake.

2703
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:17,670
So again,
there's ways to oppose trump and the 

2704
01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:17,710
Russia thing,
isn't it?

2705
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:20,470
The way to oppose trump is you offer 
people something else.

2706
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,470
He ran to the left of Hillary Clinton on
foreign policy.

2707
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:28,530
He wanted to end our foreign wars is 
according to his rhetoric and his 

2708
01:59:28,530 --> 01:59:31,261
campaign,
he wanted to give everybody healthcare 

2709
01:59:31,261 --> 01:59:33,150
member.
Everyone's going to get healthcare and 

2710
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:33,150
it's going to be cheaper.
That was his.

2711
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:33,550
Of course he stayed.
He's doing the exact opposite.

2712
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:38,590
Yeah,
so who does the thing they say they're 

2713
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:39,350
gonna do whatever.
Whoever does the thing.

2714
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:41,650
Who's ever done it?
Oh No,

2715
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:42,800
nobody.
That's why he got.

2716
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,100
That's why democracy is not based on 
trust.

2717
01:59:45,101 --> 01:59:48,100
It's based on mistrust.
It's based on transparency.

2718
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:49,320
You remember that bit?
That bill,

2719
01:59:49,890 --> 01:59:52,080
Bill Hicks,
he used to do about a.

2720
01:59:52,081 --> 01:59:55,860
That is something along the lines of,
I think that when you get elected,

2721
01:59:55,861 --> 02:00:00,861
they bring into a smoky room filled with
globalists and they show you an angle of

2722
02:00:00,991 --> 02:00:03,690
the Kennedy assassination that you've 
never seen before.

2723
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,410
They roll it out.
Any questions?

2724
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:12,230
What's my agenda?
But it almost seems like that's what 

2725
02:00:12,230 --> 02:00:12,480
happens.
Obama,

2726
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:17,630
Obama changed his tune,
remembering the hope and change website 

2727
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:19,500
that had all that shit about 
whistleblowers afforded protection.

2728
02:00:19,530 --> 02:00:21,240
That was all gone the day he got 
elected.

2729
02:00:21,241 --> 02:00:26,241
That was a while ago.
It took a while for him being an office 

2730
02:00:26,241 --> 02:00:28,170
where they realized that it was still in
there on deleted it all.

2731
02:00:28,910 --> 02:00:30,980
He disbanded his own followers.
Right.

2732
02:00:30,981 --> 02:00:32,750
So when he got elected,
Barack Obama,

2733
02:00:32,751 --> 02:00:35,720
he had all these young people who were 
activated and they signed up.

2734
02:00:35,721 --> 02:00:38,650
He had a mailing list,
eat at all and we want to go do shit for

2735
02:00:38,651 --> 02:00:40,400
you want to go back.
And they were like,

2736
02:00:40,401 --> 02:00:41,540
get rid of them.
And he did.

2737
02:00:41,930 --> 02:00:43,670
He got rid of them because you can't 
control them.

2738
02:00:43,671 --> 02:00:44,570
They,
yes,

2739
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,170
they fuck them.
And that's,

2740
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:47,700
you know.
And you know,

2741
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:49,670
then Bernie Sanders has his campaign and
says,

2742
02:00:49,671 --> 02:00:54,671
everybody,
we've got to fight this fucking evil 

2743
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:54,671
machine.
And then on a dime he goes,

2744
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:54,671
hey,
by the way,

2745
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:56,690
let's join this evil machine.
It's a little thing happens.

2746
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:58,130
Um,
I don't know.

2747
02:00:58,131 --> 02:00:59,420
You know,
I really don't know.

2748
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:01,820
I bought it good at that.
I know what people have said.

2749
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:06,821
Chris Hedges said that Bernie Sanders 
didn't want to end up like Ralph Nader 

2750
02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:07,580
who was unfairly held accountable again 
for the Democrats.

2751
02:01:07,610 --> 02:01:10,940
The Democrats lost to heal to fucking a 
game show host.

2752
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:16,600
And that's what this is all about.
They can't come to terms with this and 

2753
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:20,291
they don't want us to examine the system
that gave us trump and they don't want 

2754
02:01:20,291 --> 02:01:23,381
to examine how they could have the most 
qualified person to book couldn't even 

2755
02:01:23,381 --> 02:01:24,110
beat fucking Donald Trump.
That's how qualified you are.

2756
02:01:24,111 --> 02:01:24,230
You.

2757
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:30,030
Well,
they wanted trump to win because they 

2758
02:01:30,030 --> 02:01:30,030
thought he'd be the easiest guy to beat 
in the election.

2759
02:01:30,030 --> 02:01:34,480
That was the song.
Isn't it funny that nobody gets mad at 

2760
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:34,640
them?
Nobody's upset at Chris Hayes for having

2761
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:37,040
empty podiums of trump for an whole 
show,

2762
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:39,770
which I saw and then he wags his finger 
at Surandon.

2763
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:44,890
You're the son of a bitch.
You prop trump up and you didn't cover 

2764
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:45,620
Bernie Sanders because you were fucking 
told not to,

2765
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:50,680
and we know that for a fact because the 
Ed Schultz and now you're going to 

2766
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:53,471
pretend like you're a sanctimonious 
fucking brick and you're going to wag 

2767
02:01:53,471 --> 02:01:53,690
your finger at people with no money and 
no power.

2768
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:58,780
Meanwhile,
you have the biggest microphone of 

2769
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:00,581
anybody and you fucking prop Donald 
Trump up and you don't take 

2770
02:02:00,581 --> 02:02:03,761
responsibility.
That's why he's a piece of shit and 

2771
02:02:03,761 --> 02:02:03,761
couldn't eat.
Very excited,

2772
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:08,920
very excited.
That's why he's doing their bidding 

2773
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:08,920
right now.
All those people are doing their bidding

2774
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:10,250
because Ed Schultz revealed and fill 
down and you,

2775
02:02:10,251 --> 02:02:13,160
if you tell the truth,
they will fucking fire your ass.

2776
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,850
They've got guys like Lee Veggie and and
Rachel maddow pretending they don't know

2777
02:02:16,851 --> 02:02:20,420
how net neutrality works.
I don't know what it is.

2778
02:02:20,421 --> 02:02:22,310
A good as it gets a big thing.
I know it's important,

2779
02:02:22,311 --> 02:02:24,230
but I don't know which way we'll see how
it rolls out.

2780
02:02:24,231 --> 02:02:24,840
I don't know what the middle.

2781
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:30,170
That's what tools or hate.
I'm not saying I wouldn't do it too.

2782
02:02:30,171 --> 02:02:32,690
I'm just not being offered 30 grand a 
day to sell my soul.

2783
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:37,780
I would.
It seems confusing to me that they're 

2784
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:41,291
thinking about using hillary again 
because it seems to me that she's 

2785
02:02:41,291 --> 02:02:43,970
starting to make her way back into new 
cycles and given speeches.

2786
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,000
She has a pack that's supposed to be 
supporting women who are running for 

2787
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,740
office except not Cynthia Nixon.
Well,

2788
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:55,810
she's going to prop up the most corrupt 
fucker in New York has had for a long 

2789
02:02:55,810 --> 02:02:58,631
time.
It was supposed to be about just women 

2790
02:02:58,631 --> 02:02:59,030
whose gender.
She says that's what the gender based.

2791
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:01,790
She said she was starting a pack to help
encourage women to run.

2792
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:03,680
That's.
I read that in an interview with her and

2793
02:03:03,681 --> 02:03:04,280
I'm like,
really?

2794
02:03:04,281 --> 02:03:06,320
Why isn't that pack?
Then supporting Cynthia Nixon.

2795
02:03:06,321 --> 02:03:08,000
Why are you supporting,
you know,

2796
02:03:08,001 --> 02:03:11,020
what the fuck she was,
she independent.

2797
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:14,690
She running a Democrat and she's running
against Cuomo.

2798
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:18,470
And um,
so of course I'm was running for mayor.

2799
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:21,200
No governor was running for governor in 
New York.

2800
02:03:21,870 --> 02:03:23,900
I knew she was running for something I 
didn't know was that big.

2801
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:25,930
And you know,
Cuomo is one of the most corrupt.

2802
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:27,600
He said he,
he's just a,

2803
02:03:27,601 --> 02:03:29,120
again,
we have one party rule,

2804
02:03:29,121 --> 02:03:34,121
we have corporate rule and all these 
people are in bed with the corporations 

2805
02:03:34,121 --> 02:03:37,271
because their body,
because that's the way our elections 

2806
02:03:37,271 --> 02:03:38,330
work and that's the whole.
That's why Hillary Clinton has a private

2807
02:03:38,331 --> 02:03:41,450
position and a public position and I'm 
not saying she's the only one,

2808
02:03:41,451 --> 02:03:46,451
but she's the one that we know actually 
literally said that because of 

2809
02:03:46,451 --> 02:03:46,451
wikileaks,
thank God.

2810
02:03:46,451 --> 02:03:47,250
And that again,
I'll go back to Julian signs.

2811
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:52,270
The fact that none of the reporters in 
the United States are sticking up for 

2812
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:55,451
Julian Assan shows you that what they do
is fucking wrestling and they don't do 

2813
02:03:55,451 --> 02:03:56,090
real journalism wrestling.

2814
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:59,060
And what's really interesting about the 
Julia naissance things,

2815
02:03:59,061 --> 02:04:04,010
if you ask people what he did that 
because of the reductionist thinking,

2816
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:09,130
because of the,
they've allowed this narrative to play 

2817
02:04:09,130 --> 02:04:11,531
for it.
They'll say he's accused of sexual 

2818
02:04:11,531 --> 02:04:12,260
assault and when you find out the actual
facts of it,

2819
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:17,380
his woman consensual sex and then the 
middle of the night he stuck it in 

2820
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:18,850
without a condom.
And they were calling.

2821
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:21,680
They were calling it surprised sex.
I don't know.

2822
02:04:21,810 --> 02:04:23,660
But there's no.
I mean it didn't make any sense.

2823
02:04:23,661 --> 02:04:27,740
And why the pressure him to the United 
States for surprise sex that he had in.

2824
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:29,810
Where was it?
Norway or somewhat the first.

2825
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:31,430
Of course they want to kind of come at 
you.

2826
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:34,190
Of course,
if they want to get the CIA wants to get

2827
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:35,610
you the first thing to do,
oh he's probably by betsy.

2828
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:37,080
He's a rapist.
Let's get some going.

2829
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:41,820
And that whole prosecutor who tries to 
prosecutor was discredited for doing so.

2830
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:46,460
They were apologized to Julian asides 
the UN stuck up for his.

2831
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:48,300
Stood up for Julian to size and the 
woman.

2832
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:51,180
So this is why they're still.
They still have them.

2833
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:54,360
Hold up in the Ecuadorian embassy.
What is he going to do?

2834
02:04:54,361 --> 02:04:55,500
They want to kick him out,
right?

2835
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:56,540
Well,
the ACL was,

2836
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,440
I think supporting him in the United 
States.

2837
02:04:58,441 --> 02:04:59,550
So,
and you know,

2838
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:04,551
certain people of character or are,
are supporting him or not him,

2839
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:08,910
but the idea of journalistic integrity,
freedom of speech,

2840
02:05:08,911 --> 02:05:10,620
the right to publish.
If you watch that movie,

2841
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:15,830
the post,
which was all about Daniel Ellsberg and 

2842
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:15,830
the,
and the Vietnam,

2843
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:19,750
uh,
the Pentagon papers which expose that 

2844
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:20,670
for administrations were lying to us 
about the Vietnam War.

2845
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:22,110
Not a Republican,
not a democrat.

2846
02:05:22,111 --> 02:05:27,111
They're all again the same.
Fucking two wings of the same party to 

2847
02:05:27,111 --> 02:05:27,111
right wings.

2848
02:05:27,111 --> 02:05:30,800
It's the military industrial party.
And the hero of that movie is the woman 

2849
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:32,280
who was the head of the Washington Post.
Not Daniel Ellsberg.

2850
02:05:32,281 --> 02:05:37,281
He was a real fucking hero.
But how can you make that movie in this 

2851
02:05:37,281 --> 02:05:39,960
day and age and not mentioned Chelsea 
manning not mentioned Edward Snowden and

2852
02:05:39,961 --> 02:05:40,710
not go,
you know,

2853
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:46,090
Daniel Ellsberg's up today.
We imprison them and that's what we're 

2854
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:46,090
doing.
We in prison,

2855
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:50,421
the Daniel Ellsberg's up today,
and everybody who watched panels of the 

2856
02:05:50,421 --> 02:05:51,640
actors from that movie and the director 
and sit around and talk,

2857
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:56,750
nobody ever brings the shit up.
It's unfucking believable to me that 

2858
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:57,220
they don't understand that they're just,
they're doing pr.

2859
02:05:57,230 --> 02:06:02,230
That's propaganda.
Look how good our Washington Post 

2860
02:06:02,230 --> 02:06:05,060
Washington Post went on to lead us into 
every fucking war after that movie was 

2861
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:05,790
supposedly made,
right?

2862
02:06:05,791 --> 02:06:10,791
So after,
after they did that and they printed 

2863
02:06:10,791 --> 02:06:10,791
that,
they backed every goddamn more sense.

2864
02:06:10,791 --> 02:06:13,920
They're the ones who told us that Saddam
had weapons of mass destruction.

2865
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:17,940
And it was irrefutable.
That was the headline on their editorial

2866
02:06:17,941 --> 02:06:19,170
page.
It wasn't [inaudible].

2867
02:06:19,290 --> 02:06:23,070
It was their editorial board said air 
refutable doubt always at that fake news

2868
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:28,160
should they have their facebook page 
taken down that actually led to the 

2869
02:06:28,160 --> 02:06:28,920
fucking death of millions of people.
So,

2870
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:31,170
um,
this is what this is.

2871
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:33,420
This is why I have a show.
This is what I'm talking about.

2872
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:35,280
And thank God the a.
In a sense,

2873
02:06:35,281 --> 02:06:40,281
thank God the media sucks so bad because
now I get to do their job and I'm a 

2874
02:06:40,281 --> 02:06:43,671
fucking idiot.
I'm a C student Jag off nightclub 

2875
02:06:43,671 --> 02:06:44,580
comedian and I do my job better than 
they do.

2876
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:46,800
Well,
you don't have a boss.

2877
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:49,920
That's the thing,
not you're not beholding to anybody.

2878
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:52,320
I was just offered a TV show and I want 
to say by who,

2879
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:57,960
and I'm a,
I was Satan and I was offered anything I

2880
02:06:57,961 --> 02:06:58,560
wanted me.

2881
02:06:58,590 --> 02:07:03,590
You want to do,
do you want to do five days in the 

2882
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:03,590
morning?
You want to do one day a week?

2883
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:03,590
You want to do this?
I'll give you your own studio,

2884
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:04,260
your own crew,
the whole deal.

2885
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:10,460
And I had to look at the guy and I said,
you have been waiting my whole career 

2886
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:10,460
for somebody to make me an offer like 
this.

2887
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:11,420
And I just have to tell you know things.
Wow.

2888
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:12,540
And he's like,
what?

2889
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:13,920
What do you want?
And I said,

2890
02:07:13,921 --> 02:07:15,780
I don't want anything.
I already have everything I want.

2891
02:07:16,450 --> 02:07:21,450
And um,
he and I got to want to drive across 

2892
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:21,450
town to go do a show and somebody else's
studio.

2893
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:22,470
I walk out my back door,
I do my show in my garage.

2894
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:24,480
I don't fucking need your money.
I don't need a boss,

2895
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:27,060
I don't need it.
I'm selling out theaters right now.

2896
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:28,140
That's what I want to do.
I go,

2897
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:29,990
I don't want to.
I want to spend less time in the studio,

2898
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,980
more time tutoring,
because that's fun,

2899
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,410
dude.
It is unbelievable.

2900
02:07:34,490 --> 02:07:34,980
I,
I,

2901
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:37,810
the best part of my life is right now.
It's unbelievable.

2902
02:07:37,890 --> 02:07:39,970
I'm so glad I didn't kill myself eight 
years ago.

2903
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:43,000
I was so.
I was so close to killing myself.

2904
02:07:43,001 --> 02:07:48,001
I'm so glad I did it.
And it was my hatred for people that 

2905
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:48,001
kept me alive.
Amazing.

2906
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:49,240
Because was.
I didn't want people.

2907
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:51,880
I already said this to you.
I didn't want people to go out high.

2908
02:07:51,881 --> 02:07:53,110
He didn't make it.
I was like,

2909
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:58,140
fuck you.
I am making it and then I'm going to 

2910
02:07:58,140 --> 02:08:00,130
kill myself.
I don't say that.

2911
02:08:00,131 --> 02:08:03,490
They'll use that as a see that that 
killed himself.

2912
02:08:03,491 --> 02:08:06,220
He didn't get suicided.
It didn't get silenced.

2913
02:08:06,221 --> 02:08:08,420
I didn't.
So I was,

2914
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,960
I was just back in Chicago and I played 
a place called Thalia Hall,

2915
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:13,190
which is fucking,
that's where Brian Callen just did his,

2916
02:08:13,191 --> 02:08:15,040
uh,
his new special beautiful.

2917
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:17,100
Have a video up from that show on my 
channel.

2918
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:20,830
It was so I used to live in,
when I started to be a comedian,

2919
02:08:20,831 --> 02:08:22,840
I moved to that neighborhood.
It was back then.

2920
02:08:22,841 --> 02:08:24,220
It wasn't a nice neighborhood,
right?

2921
02:08:24,221 --> 02:08:27,040
It was like a tougher neighborhood,
but I got to live closer to the city and

2922
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:32,041
all my comedian friends live there 
because it was affordable and now it's 

2923
02:08:32,041 --> 02:08:32,530
being gentrified and shit and they've 
got this new theater and it's.

2924
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:35,230
I mean it's not new,
but it's old and they refurbished it and

2925
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:37,510
it's 600 people and I came out and it 
was just like,

2926
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:40,270
it was just like heaven,
you know,

2927
02:08:40,271 --> 02:08:45,271
and I get my whole career.
I tried to figure out how to get people 

2928
02:08:45,271 --> 02:08:48,031
to stand up at the end of my set.
Like how do I get what I don't want to 

2929
02:08:48,031 --> 02:08:48,031
do it in a shitty way.
I want to manipulate them,

2930
02:08:48,031 --> 02:08:51,010
but I want to have come from my heart 
and inspire people and make them want to

2931
02:08:51,011 --> 02:08:51,760
stand up,
you know,

2932
02:08:51,761 --> 02:08:52,840
to get a standing ovation.

2933
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:54,940
Right.
And now they stand up when I come out.

2934
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:56,920
Wow.
I don't have to worry about it.

2935
02:08:57,310 --> 02:09:02,310
It's already done.
So this is the greatest time of my life 

2936
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:02,890
and it's because nobody,
you know,

2937
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,380
people can't get anywhere else.
What I'm doing,

2938
02:09:06,020 --> 02:09:07,690
uh,
is just nothing else like it.

2939
02:09:07,691 --> 02:09:09,790
You know,
Bill Maher of God bless his soul,

2940
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:14,820
you know,
he's a corporatist and he's part of the 

2941
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:14,820
problem.
Right.

2942
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:15,050
And I like,
I like Bill Maher.

2943
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:20,180
I'd love to.
I read his book that he read about who 

2944
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:20,180
wrote about common.
I bet you ain't even know he had one.

2945
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:20,200
It was,
it was really funny.

2946
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:20,790
No,
no,

2947
02:09:20,791 --> 02:09:21,120
no.
The uh,

2948
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:23,040
the novel.
I wrote that true.

2949
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:25,110
I think it was called true story story.
Yeah.

2950
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:27,060
I love that.
That's a great book.

2951
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,320
Twice was the one guy's name.
Shit.

2952
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:29,920
Shit.
Fuck.

2953
02:09:29,921 --> 02:09:31,060
Chink.
And something else.

2954
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:32,950
He better be careful.

2955
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:35,110
You better be careful because that's 
enough about that book.

2956
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:36,950
Ethnic slur,
right?

2957
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:38,770
The characters names.
That's right.

2958
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,660
Those from the eighties,
nineties,

2959
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:41,420
nineties.
Yeah.

2960
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:46,440
So he wrote about it.
He wrote about how it comedy modern day 

2961
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:49,411
comedy got started and how it was really
interesting book about he would go on 

2962
02:09:49,411 --> 02:09:51,880
the road and it would be the,
he'd be the first comedian that club had

2963
02:09:51,881 --> 02:09:53,560
ever seen and they didn't know.
He was like,

2964
02:09:53,561 --> 02:09:55,390
the waitresses didn't know he was 
leaving the next week.

2965
02:09:55,391 --> 02:09:56,600
Shit like that.
It was like,

2966
02:09:56,860 --> 02:10:01,860
it didn't sink in how things work.
It was such an interesting book to read 

2967
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:02,300
anyway,
but now he's,

2968
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:07,390
you know,
he brags that he gave a million dollars 

2969
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:07,390
to Barack Obama,
which fantastic too.

2970
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:07,390
But did he really?
Yeah.

2971
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:09,040
I'm not on air so,
you know,

2972
02:10:09,041 --> 02:10:11,500
it's just like I get it.
I W I aspire to be Bill Maher.

2973
02:10:11,501 --> 02:10:14,460
I aspire to be a millionaire for 30 
years and a little bit out of touch.

2974
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:16,180
That's good for you.
You did it.

2975
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:19,730
You did it.
Oh God.

2976
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,070
So anyway,
but it's good.

2977
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:21,640
You know,
again,

2978
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:26,770
I get upset because I want him to be 
better or be more like I want them to 

2979
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:27,040
be,
but it actually helps me.

2980
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:30,040
Right.
So the more he's he shifts to the right,

2981
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:32,110
the more his audience comes to me,
right?

2982
02:10:32,111 --> 02:10:37,111
And the more I get on stage,
I'll have to do as much as an ame on 

2983
02:10:37,111 --> 02:10:37,111
stage at a live show and people fuck,
boom.

2984
02:10:37,111 --> 02:10:37,111
Right?
Yeah.

2985
02:10:37,111 --> 02:10:38,930
It's progressives don't like him.
Now he's.

2986
02:10:39,110 --> 02:10:44,110
He doesn't not happen.
When did that happen for Bernie Sanders 

2987
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:44,110
campaign?
Real.

2988
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:48,610
He doesn't get that.
There's a difference that there's a 

2989
02:10:48,610 --> 02:10:48,610
difference between the Hillary and 
Bernie Sanders.

2990
02:10:48,610 --> 02:10:50,510
How could he not get it?
You tell me.

2991
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:51,570
He,
he's had we,

2992
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:51,980
we,
we,

2993
02:10:51,981 --> 02:10:53,730
I played videos of him saying that.
Yeah.

2994
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,190
Now they were basically the same.

2995
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:56,060
What's the big deal?
Then?

2996
02:10:56,140 --> 02:10:57,920
These progressives are just being 
babies.

2997
02:10:57,921 --> 02:11:02,921
And isn't it funny?
Progressives are being babies when they 

2998
02:11:02,921 --> 02:11:05,771
won't support warmongering corporatists,
but centrus corporatist start being 

2999
02:11:05,771 --> 02:11:06,830
adults.
When they fuck over progressive's,

3000
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:08,600
they don't.
They don't ever accommodate them.

3001
02:11:08,601 --> 02:11:11,210
They don't ever drop their values and 
come over and be progressive.

3002
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,760
We're always supposed to go that way.
They never go the other way.

3003
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:15,080
That unity means,
hey,

3004
02:11:15,081 --> 02:11:18,830
you guys shut the fuck up and fall in 
line and become a corporatist.

3005
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:21,590
That's what they mean when they say 
unity and it ain't happening,

3006
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:26,710
and I'm telling you,
Bernie Sanders is making a big mistake 

3007
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:26,710
by not starting a third party right now.
That's how you influence.

3008
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:29,720
If he does not win the Democratic 
nomination in 20 slash 20,

3009
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:32,330
what is he built over these four years?
Fucking nothing.

3010
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:35,720
Do you think he's going to run?
Run in 20 slash 20?

3011
02:11:35,770 --> 02:11:37,850
Yes.
That's what this is all about.

3012
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:40,550
That's what this is all about.
Thought he had said he was done.

3013
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:43,190
I thought he said he wasn't gonna.
Try again.

3014
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:44,750
He's running again.
He thinks if there's.

3015
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:46,640
I'll make that prediction.
Yeah,

3016
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:48,320
I'll make that prediction that you a 
dollar.

3017
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:52,400
I'll bet you $2 doubled down.
Five bucks.

3018
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:53,220
Okay.
All right.

3019
02:11:53,870 --> 02:11:56,360
I'll go five bucks.
So I'll tell you how you can afford five

3020
02:11:56,361 --> 02:11:57,950
bucks.
Best time of my life.

3021
02:11:57,951 --> 02:12:01,420
I can't believe.
I can't believe how amazing.

3022
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:03,530
It's so nice to not have no 
representation right now,

3023
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:05,300
by the way.
I have not been better.

3024
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:07,040
It's almost yes.
That's even better.

3025
02:12:07,041 --> 02:12:08,660
You get all the Cheddar.
I was working.

3026
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:10,580
I was working with this guy,
Alex Murray,

3027
02:12:10,581 --> 02:12:15,581
who's a great guy.
I love Alex Murray and he got me 

3028
02:12:15,581 --> 02:12:18,071
specials.
You got to be comedy central specialist 

3029
02:12:18,071 --> 02:12:18,071
who especially special.
He sold a book for me.

3030
02:12:18,071 --> 02:12:18,980
Fucking great guy.
I love Alex Murray,

3031
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:20,600
but he got real busy,
right?

3032
02:12:20,601 --> 02:12:25,601
He represents a bunch of really Chris 
hardwick and know he had anyway and Jim 

3033
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:27,160
Gaffigan,
all these guys he represents.

3034
02:12:27,161 --> 02:12:29,900
So he got too busy for me,
which I understand.

3035
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:31,160
It was weird.
He stopped,

3036
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:33,050
so we stopped working together.
Right.

3037
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:33,740
Is My show.

3038
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:36,760
Ah,
right.

3039
02:12:36,761 --> 02:12:39,130
Is that like what the fuck?
And all of a sudden people started

3040
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,950
showing up at clubs when I'm there and 
I'm like,

3041
02:12:40,951 --> 02:12:41,850
Whoa,
whoa.

3042
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,010
And we start selling out weeks ahead of 
time.

3043
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:48,840
I did the Chicago theater in how many 
seats is that?

3044
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:50,850
Thirty 700.
Jesus,

3045
02:12:50,851 --> 02:12:52,980
you are popular.
Pretty popular.

3046
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,040
Jesus Christ.
Don't know what happened,

3047
02:12:56,041 --> 02:13:01,041
but I did the Chicago theater many years
ago and I remember saying something 

3048
02:13:01,041 --> 02:13:03,960
about the podcast and I said,
how many you guys listen to the podcast?

3049
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:07,710
And it was a roar through the crowd.
And I went,

3050
02:13:07,770 --> 02:13:10,860
whoa.
That was when I realized I was like,

3051
02:13:10,861 --> 02:13:12,050
whoa.
Oh yeah.

3052
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:13,070
Was going on.
Yeah.

3053
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:18,170
Like I didn't think I thought I was 
going to be like 10 percent of the 

3054
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:18,170
people.
I got it.

3055
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:19,050
I don't,
I don't pay attention to anything,

3056
02:13:19,051 --> 02:13:24,051
man.
This is one of the secrets from me 

3057
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:24,900
staying me and people and people have 
accused me of changing.

3058
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,420
It's called I evolve as a person.
I,

3059
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:30,720
I learn more.
I studied myself.

3060
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:32,190
I'm ruthlessly

3061
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:34,680
critical of myself.
I'm very analytical,

3062
02:13:34,681 --> 02:13:39,681
self analytical,
and I don't like a lot of the stuff I 

3063
02:13:39,681 --> 02:13:43,100
do.
This is just so I get better at it 

3064
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:43,100
hopefully.
But,

3065
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:46,870
um,
I just didn't know that anybody was 

3066
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:46,870
paying attention.
I didn't,

3067
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:46,870
wasn't.
I wasn't looking.

3068
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:50,430
I don't look at numbers.
I occasionally look and I go to,

3069
02:13:50,431 --> 02:13:52,420
I don't want any think about that and I 
don't think about it.

3070
02:13:52,421 --> 02:13:57,421
I just do it.
But that moment where I was in front of 

3071
02:13:57,421 --> 02:14:00,501
3,700
people and know how many guys listened 

3072
02:14:00,501 --> 02:14:00,501
to the podcast and I went,
I was like,

3073
02:14:00,501 --> 02:14:02,280
Whoa,
okay.

3074
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:07,460
This is not what I expected.
I thought it was going to be a bunch of 

3075
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:07,460
people,
people like,

3076
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:10,380
no ma'am,
no fear booked or UFC whatever.

3077
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:15,890
And um,
that's when I realized something was 

3078
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:15,890
going on there.
That's a weird feeling,

3079
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:19,341
right?
When you realize all these people are 

3080
02:14:19,341 --> 02:14:19,341
coming to see you because of something 
you did yourself.

3081
02:14:19,341 --> 02:14:19,341
Yeah.
It was the yes,

3082
02:14:19,341 --> 02:14:19,960
because it's something you did and it 
was,

3083
02:14:19,990 --> 02:14:22,330
it was when I stopped trying almost.
There's one

3084
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:26,300
marilyn,
Marilyn stop trying is when w WTF?

3085
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:27,920
Yes.
That same with me.

3086
02:14:27,921 --> 02:14:30,470
Like when I stop censoring myself or 
overthinking,

3087
02:14:30,471 --> 02:14:33,170
like I would go on stage and I would 
have my jokes down to a science.

3088
02:14:33,171 --> 02:14:36,110
Right.
And that's obviously youtube is not that

3089
02:14:36,111 --> 02:14:39,350
way and I just let it rip and that's the
thing that connected with people.

3090
02:14:39,351 --> 02:14:40,280
It's so amazing.
And it,

3091
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:45,310
and the Burbank Burbank Comedy Festival 
at that flappers comedy club and they 

3092
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:48,110
asked me to go,
would you do your podcast here at 5:00

3093
02:14:48,111 --> 02:14:49,880
on a Thursday or whatever.
And I was like okay,

3094
02:14:49,881 --> 02:14:50,840
I'll do it for you.
Whatever.

3095
02:14:51,320 --> 02:14:55,190
And I did about five people there who's 
going to fucking show up at 5:00

3096
02:14:55,191 --> 02:14:56,690
on a Thursday in Burbank,
right?

3097
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:58,400
Places almost full.
And I was like,

3098
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:01,430
oh,
that's what I was like,

3099
02:15:01,431 --> 02:15:03,710
Woo,
what the fuck's going on?

3100
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:05,020
Five o'clock.
And there were,

3101
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:06,800
there were girls there.
I am not,

3102
02:15:06,801 --> 02:15:11,801
I'll never forget this,
that they came from Compton when they 

3103
02:15:11,801 --> 02:15:11,801
were like,
oh,

3104
02:15:11,801 --> 02:15:11,801
we had to get off work.

3105
02:15:11,801 --> 02:15:12,920
We had to get a ride.
When we got here,

3106
02:15:12,921 --> 02:15:13,910
we worked.
He had to see.

3107
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:15,620
And I was like,
wow,

3108
02:15:15,621 --> 02:15:17,470
I'm really connecting with people right?
That,

3109
02:15:17,830 --> 02:15:22,830
that don't look like me,
but they share the same ideology and it 

3110
02:15:22,830 --> 02:15:27,131
just,
it's like when I would go see George 

3111
02:15:27,131 --> 02:15:27,131
Carlin,
if you ever went and saw him live,

3112
02:15:27,131 --> 02:15:30,970
there were 80 year old hippies and they 
were a teenager kids and there was 

3113
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:31,430
everybody in between and that's what it 
looks like at my shows.

3114
02:15:31,431 --> 02:15:35,120
And it makes me so fucking happy.
It's so that's when it,

3115
02:15:35,150 --> 02:15:35,950
that's when it's.
I was like,

3116
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:37,160
whoa.
And I was like,

3117
02:15:37,161 --> 02:15:38,960
thanks flappers for making me do this 
show,

3118
02:15:38,961 --> 02:15:39,680
because now I realize,

3119
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:41,700
and Jimmy,
I'm happy for you too,

3120
02:15:41,701 --> 02:15:46,701
and I,
I really think that you're one of the 

3121
02:15:46,701 --> 02:15:48,990
only people out there that really 
doesn't toe a line one way or the other.

3122
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:52,050
You really do speak the truth.
And I said that about you the first time

3123
02:15:52,230 --> 02:15:53,880
I said about you before I ever had you 
on.

3124
02:15:53,881 --> 02:15:55,950
I was like,
this guy just says what he thinks.

3125
02:15:55,951 --> 02:15:57,480
Whether you agree with them or disagree 
with them,

3126
02:15:57,481 --> 02:15:59,460
you can't point to him and say,
Oh,

3127
02:15:59,461 --> 02:16:03,300
this guy is just a left wing hack,
or this guy is a right wing apologist,

3128
02:16:03,301 --> 02:16:08,301
or whatever it is.
You just say what you think and that is 

3129
02:16:08,301 --> 02:16:11,040
so refreshing and it's so valuable.
There's just not enough of that today.

3130
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:16,430
There's not enough.
And these people that are super 

3131
02:16:16,430 --> 02:16:18,781
intelligent that think that if you vote 
one way it's a protest vote and he 

3132
02:16:18,931 --> 02:16:23,931
shouldn't have a protest vote because 
you're throwing away your vote and you 

3133
02:16:23,931 --> 02:16:25,530
gonna let the right wing people when 
like you're missing everything.

3134
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:29,950
You're missing this whole thing.
This whole thing is super complicated,

3135
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,980
it's very complicated and the only way 
to see through the haze is to be honest 

3136
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:36,430
and you're one of the only people that's
doing it.

3137
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:41,460
Well.
I really appreciate you saying that and 

3138
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:41,460
I think that there's a lot of common 
ground,

3139
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:45,151
especially when it comes to getting 
corporations fingers out of our 

3140
02:16:45,151 --> 02:16:48,271
government and ending wars.
I think a lot of people agree on that 

3141
02:16:48,271 --> 02:16:48,271
and that actually scares the 
establishment.

3142
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:49,690
Yeah,
I think it does.

3143
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:51,490
Jimmy.
Joe,

3144
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:52,390
thanks for being here,
man.

3145

Thanks for having me.
I really,

3146
02:16:53,170 --> 02:16:55,330
really appreciate it.
