1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,500
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,723
Yeah,

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,700
that's it.

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,230
You know what?

5
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,890
As much as I'm afraid I'm going to make
that walk that they have the day of the

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,130
day,

7
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,990
the day of it,

8
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,460
and I'm going to do it regardless.

9
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,320
It sounds more crazy.

10
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,300
I would be more afraid of a guy that says,

11
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:16,260
I'm like,

12
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,450
it says like I'm afraid,

13
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,880
but you know what I'm going to still
do with and I don't care if I'm afraid

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,601
bring it,

15
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,141
I'll do it.

16
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,670
Like this is sound crazy to me.

17
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,780
More than a guy said,

18
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:25,141
oh no,

19
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:25,291
no,

20
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:25,561
no.

21
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not afraid because this guy,

22
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:27,481
he's a light.

23
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,860
He's afraid to say that he's afraid.

24
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,140
He's like man,

25
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,990
you know what I mean?

26
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,180
To me personally,

27
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,083
that's where it is.

28
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,020
Yeah.

29
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,730
The posturing and posing.

30
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,930
It's unnecessary.

31
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,303
Exactly.

32
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,860
But you are afraid of aliens though,

33
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:43,550
right?

34
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:43,851
Yeah.

35
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:44,710
My friend has

36
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,550
a path mapped out in your house.

37
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,500
How to get out of the aliens show up.

38
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,830
No,

39
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,110
that's the rumor man.

40
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:54,944
That's what I heard.

41
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,280
I heard you have a plan cause I know
you like to use game plans so I know,

42
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,830
I know cat ready and I know Jujitsu.

43
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,280
So the alien show up.

44
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:08,750
I put a triangle choke on him and I
also have a cat ammo so I kept that to a

45
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:09,171
Japanese.

46
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:09,621
Get that now.

47
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:10,281
So either they come,

48
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:11,450
I can slice them apart.

49
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,021
Wow.

50
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:13,460
Do you keep a sword in your house?

51
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,490
It's a collection.

52
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:17,260
You know it's funny.

53
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,970
It's have to not bring
any crazy bitches home.

54
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,740
I man sword and crazy bitches.

55
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,950
I have this tax on the side of my bed
that I always forget is there and I was

56
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,860
like almost cut my
finger off all the time.

57
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,370
And you should put down in the garage

58
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,040
big sword slash meat
cleaver that it's just

59
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,710
so do you really have a fear of aliens
or is this just a bullshit rumor?

60
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,220
Cause it,

61
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,610
what didn't you do a countdown show and
you did a whole thing talking about how

62
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,620
you being scared of
being abducted by aliens.

63
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,620
Yeah,

64
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,260
I'm scared.

65
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,380
I'm scared of a lot of things

66
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,743
I'll get,

67
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,190
I'll get into it.

68
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:55,530
Like I can,

69
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:55,791
I got,

70
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,230
I got,

71
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,690
I kept talking about it right now or the,

72
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:58,830
and I'm talking about it right now.

73
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,650
It's one day we're going to come all
that and make a big thing about it.

74
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:03,290
But no,

75
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:03,810
wait,

76
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,150
hold on,

77
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,461
hold on,

78
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:05,020
hold on.

79
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,560
Yeah.

80
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,290
Have you had an experience with aliens?

81
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,780
No.

82
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,030
No,

83
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,170
no,

84
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,271
no,

85
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:10,820
no.

86
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,653
I don't believe you.

87
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,431
I don't believe you.

88
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:13,711
Okay.

89
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,270
No,

90
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,930
I don't know.

91
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,440
You don't know.

92
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,890
You might have had an experience with it.

93
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,130
I,

94
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,860
my manager going to have
a heart attack right now.

95
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,660
My brother,

96
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,840
I would never do or
lead you down any path.

97
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:24,920
It's bad for your career.

98
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,830
Just as you said that it's
good that to be afraid.

99
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,690
It's also good to be
honest about everything.

100
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,171
Even shit.

101
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,120
That sounds crazy and I love it.

102
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:32,940
That's the thing.

103
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,680
I'm honest.

104
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,513
I like,

105
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,880
look,

106
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,630
I'm on s I'm afraid,

107
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,180
but I don't want to have
to tell everything on,

108
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,014
on the phone.

109
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,670
It's true.

110
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,231
You don't,

111
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:41,421
but,

112
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:41,710
but,

113
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,940
but you know,

114
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,320
you have sex with an alien
because you're a smart guy.

115
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:45,801
Let me tell you,

116
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:46,880
you're a very smart guy.

117
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:47,151
You know,

118
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,080
you know how to dig,

119
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,840
dig into people's mind.

120
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,230
And as Martin,

121
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,110
I like you ally.

122
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,910
I hate that about you because
he put me on the spot right now.

123
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,260
But he's a very smart guy.

124
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,870
But now I know I gotta I gotta go to the,

125
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,640
listen,

126
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,270
if I was on an alien spacecraft
and I had sex with an alien,

127
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,500
like I'm assuming you did,

128
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,950
I feel like I would just
come out and talk about it.

129
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,390
I don't know why he would hold that back.

130
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,171
No,

131
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:11,790
but I mean,

132
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,623
ah,

133
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,050
something happened George.

134
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,393
I don't know.

135
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,181
It's either,

136
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,030
it's either I'm crazy or,

137
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,731
or,

138
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,061
or,

139
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:19,420
uh,

140
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,500
maybe it really happened,

141
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,040
but I,

142
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,390
I hope that I'm crazy.

143
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,160
I don't think you're crazy.

144
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,060
I hope I,

145
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,780
that could be pre crazy cause he know
some people like some great mine and you

146
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:28,871
know,

147
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,201
they had,

148
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,980
they had been hallucinating
stuff or some people are,

149
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,560
I'll do say manioc with depressive.

150
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,390
Some people are,

151
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,380
are uh,

152
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,041
OCD,

153
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,870
some people are dead,

154
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,600
some people are dead
and they're still great.

155
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,650
They've been able to achieve
great stuff on their life,

156
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,101
you know,

157
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,300
so maybe I'm crazy when I was,

158
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,130
I don't know.

159
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,410
Um,

160
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,390
I opened these experiences.

161
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,930
I can help you one way or these
experiences happening at night.

162
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,750
I am not sure.

163
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,231
I have not.

164
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:57,550
I'm not sure I have any of
these experiences happen
while you've been in the

165
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:02,080
dream state or were you just been dreaming
or just asleep and you were woken up?

166
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,820
I am not sure that that expert,

167
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,291
I don't know.

168
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,700
I don't remember anything that was the,

169
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,440
was it nighttime type things?

170
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,940
It was at nighttime when you think you
might have had something happened to,

171
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,840
uh,

172
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,240
I can't say something happened to me.

173
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,680
I have no proof.

174
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,180
I just don't know.

175
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,140
What I'm going to tell you about is your
brain produces a chemical while you're

176
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:23,800
sleeping.

177
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,310
But I'm gonna,

178
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,770
I'm gonna tell you something and
I'm going to be honest about it.

179
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,393
Sometime

180
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,090
I'm looking at the clock and it's like
I wake up and I look at the clock or

181
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:41,131
right after and it's like the clock had
events like a four hour or two hours.

182
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,250
There was a time zone that I
don't remember what happened.

183
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,690
It's called falling asleep.

184
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,303
I hope so.

185
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,030
What do you think you think you're
getting snatched up and taken away for a

186
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,031
couple of hours?

187
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,370
No.

188
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:52,900
Think I'm,

189
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,040
maybe I fall asleep.

190
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,100
That's why I hope that's
why I hope or I can drive.

191
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,090
I can drive my car,

192
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,230
I can drive my car.

193
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,790
And it already happened.

194
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,061
I drove,

195
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:01,900
I drove my car.

196
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,430
[inaudible] I dunno,

197
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,140
I drove my car in a normal day,

198
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,580
like going somewhere.

199
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,060
Then I look and there's two hour pass.

200
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,580
I'm like two hour.

201
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:13,300
I'd just pass like this.

202
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,681
Like maybe,

203
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,950
maybe I didn't see it.

204
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:16,750
Maybe I didn't,

205
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,111
I didn't,

206
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:17,944
I didn't,

207
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,770
I maybe I watched their
tie the wrong time.

208
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,990
Like I watched my clock and
I made a mistake myself.

209
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,560
Right.

210
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,221
Most likely,

211
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:24,880
right?

212
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,330
Yes,

213
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,163
of course.

214
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,890
I hope so.

215
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,630
Well that's very minor stuff.

216
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,830
That's very minor stuff.

217
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,290
Yeah.

218
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:30,690
Um,

219
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,560
but that could be,

220
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,490
you talked being tired because
you push yourself and less stress.

221
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,380
It's exactly,

222
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,840
that's exactly what I hope.

223
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:38,210
So.

224
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,210
It's exactly what I hoped.

225
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:39,700
So,

226
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,670
but you don't have any memories of great
dudes putting fingers up your butt.

227
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:42,851
No,

228
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,360
I don't.

229
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,930
None of that.

230
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,730
I've had a job where you're
driving down the street,

231
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:48,310
like on the highway and you're just
like kind of dazed out and you're like,

232
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:48,551
wait,

233
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:49,380
how long I've been,

234
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:49,750
I've,

235
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,640
I've been dazed out for like 20 minutes.

236
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,170
What have I been doing for 20 minutes?

237
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,530
Autopilot.

238
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:54,891
Yeah.

239
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:55,521
And then like,

240
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,560
you just realize like
almost all of a your home.

241
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:57,980
Yeah.

242
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,600
But,

243
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,080
um,

244
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,460
did the thing about being
exhausted and sleep,

245
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:01,880
uh,

246
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,181
you know,

247
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:03,920
and having these experiences at night,

248
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,490
the,

249
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,031
there's a,

250
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,100
a chemical your brain makes that's,

251
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,490
uh,

252
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,460
one of the most powerful
psychedelic drugs don't demand.

253
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,950
So one of the things
they're trying to connect,

254
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,090
it's called DMT.

255
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,010
And one of the things
they're trying to connect is,

256
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,820
um,

257
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,590
people having near death experiences
and people that have had UFO alien

258
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:25,070
abduction type experiences and this
chemical and that they can introduce this

259
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,390
chemical into the human body.

260
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:31,070
And these people have very
similar experiences to what
they had when they had a

261
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,260
Ufo encounter or when they had,

262
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:33,640
you know,

263
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,510
a white light near death
experience and counter.

264
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,530
And it's most likely there's
this chemical that's doing this.

265
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,730
So when people having these experiences
that are very realistic and they do

266
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,290
believe they're being taken the board by,

267
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,831
you know,

268
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,060
a Ufo somewhere,

269
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,570
they might not be wrong,

270
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,550
but this is not a Ufo encounter.

271
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,800
This is just firefighting object.

272
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:54,990
The,

273
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,681
I ain't gone through,

274
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,580
we talk about that.

275
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,560
If they had been thinking a board,

276
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:58,981
this is,

277
00:06:58,981 --> 00:06:59,711
this is different.

278
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,151
It's like,

279
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:00,730
hey,

280
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,800
it could be a third type and encounter.

281
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,160
There's many ways,

282
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,030
but this is different.

283
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:06,330
Yeah.

284
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:06,820
But I,

285
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,340
the I,

286
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,301
you talk about me,

287
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:09,961
I don't have any,

288
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,840
I don't have any memory of such thing,

289
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,460
but I thing I'd,

290
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,500
I though like I have,

291
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:13,981
like you say,

292
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:14,640
sometimes I fall,

293
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,421
I fall asleep,

294
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,850
then I wake up is the
time passed and I'm like,

295
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,750
well it's like I just,

296
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,000
cause you're tired man.

297
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,250
That's not aliens.

298
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,431
Yeah,

299
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:22,611
no,

300
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,170
no.

301
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,791
Are you worried?

302
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,031
He like,

303
00:07:24,031 --> 00:07:24,510
man,

304
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,360
maybe it's an alien.

305
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,310
It's kind of what you do.

306
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,641
No,

307
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:27,710
it's because I am,

308
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,700
I felt like I didn't fall,

309
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,740
I didn't fall asleep and I'm not tired.

310
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,341
I'm wide awake,

311
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:33,174
awake,

312
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,400
but I fall asleep like
this and it's kind of,

313
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,300
I mean it's kind of weird.

314
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,070
Hard sparring days.

315
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,820
No,

316
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,180
no.

317
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,260
Just a normal day and I get good
happen everyday when you get a Gopro,

318
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,610
like a camera and just record
yourself all the time that happens.

319
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,503
Watch it.

320
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,180
I mean there's things record
for like eight hours at a time.

321
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:51,900
Some of them.

322
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,260
Yeah.

323
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,310
How long has this been going on?

324
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,413
Since I'm a kid.

325
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,523
Wow.

326
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,413
Wow.

327
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,690
Wouldn't it be crazy if the aliens like
manufactured you to be a mixed martial

328
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,690
arts fighter to like,

329
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,180
let's see if we could just turn this
[inaudible] would have happened.

330
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:10,590
I would have been much better than,

331
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,011
than,

332
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:11,790
than this.

333
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,630
Much better than this.

334
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:13,570
You're the fucking champion.

335
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,810
But if I would be out of
you in the manufacturer,

336
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:17,160
I would it be a super amount of,

337
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:17,430
you know,

338
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,290
well they just don't want
to get ridiculous with it.

339
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,000
It would be.

340
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,311
Yeah,

341
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:21,751
that would be,

342
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,370
obviously you can't turn a
guy into a goddamn superhero.

343
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,231
I don't know.

344
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:26,100
Maybe that manufacturer

345
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,920
Jon Jones,

346
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:28,754
maybe they did.

347
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,933
Aldo.

348
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,360
Maybe someone needs to talk to
them about their sleep patterns.

349
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,940
Maybe they're falling asleep behind the
wheel too and being sucked to board a

350
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,200
space ship for repairs.

351
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,040
Maybe they don't want to talk about it.

352
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,030
Maybe they don't say it,

353
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:39,661
but maybe they are.

354
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:40,140
I don't know.

355
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,591
I don't know.

356
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,210
I don't have enough breadth in the,

357
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,750
I think it's funny though that
that's maybe one subject that you,

358
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,603
uh,

359
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,700
you had a really hard time talking
about that I do because it's,

360
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,901
it's,

361
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:51,680
it sounds crazy and I,

362
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,610
and I will talk about it one day.

363
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,960
I'm going to talk about my,

364
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,770
my,

365
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,590
all that stuff and uh,

366
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,131
but no,

367
00:08:59,131 --> 00:08:59,500
no,

368
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,930
I don't get the even through this.

369
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,161
Yeah.

370
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,630
Maybe I probably asked one day,

371
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,460
I'll go,

372
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,830
I'll,

373
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,161
I'll,

374
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:05,461
I'll,

375
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,300
I'll talk about stuff.

376
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,670
But it's not what you promised one day.

377
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,180
I promise.

378
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,013
One day.

379
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,460
What is the difference?

380
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,001
No tomorrow.

381
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:16,080
Did you see rocky three when Apollo
creed says that the rocky Balboa,

382
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,330
you said maybe,

383
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,690
maybe I will die one day,

384
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,980
maybe I'll die it tomorrow.

385
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,010
I hope I touched wasn't
nothing that people,

386
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,530
oh.

387
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,320
And I'm like,

388
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,510
how did you say that it was that French?

389
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,150
I'll touch wood,

390
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,320
not I touched the there would make

391
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,551
it happen,

392
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,384
you know?

393
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,600
Yeah.

394
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,460
Just let it go.

395
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,990
Just whatever information you've got,

396
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:34,580
spill it.

397
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:34,720
No,

398
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,401
but I don't know.

399
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,061
I'm doing my,

400
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm doing my own research.

401
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,910
I'm researching on myself.

402
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,400
Like you say,

403
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,680
that's the thing that you just told me.

404
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,510
It's very interesting the chemical that,

405
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,344
but anyway,

406
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,523
that's probably that.

407
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,380
I'm happy that I meet through today.

408
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:49,590
And you tell that about me
because I make me make me happy.

409
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,433
No.

410
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,820
Well I think a lot of people think
they're going crazy and it's not.

411
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:57,010
It's just your brain makes
psychedelic drugs is true.

412
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,330
Your brain produces it and parts
of your liver and your lungs,

413
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,670
they don't know why this
stuff is in the body,

414
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,290
but it's,

415
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,490
it's a super potent psychedelic.

416
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,853
You brain makes it,

417
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,550
it happens when you're sleeping.

418
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:12,000
So if like the speculation is
that it happens during rem sleep,

419
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,060
I don't think they have the most
accurate way of measuring it,

420
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,150
but they know it's in the body
and they believe it's the,

421
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:22,080
the theory is that it comes out during
periods of heavy stress or when your body

422
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:26,370
thinks it's going to die or in rem sleep
and that those are the Times that you

423
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,390
have higher levels of this stuff
in your neurochemical soup.

424
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,123
That's an interesting,

425
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,641
crazy,

426
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,600
why would you brain,

427
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,500
why would your brain produce an
incredibly potent psychedelic drug?

428
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,710
So a lot of people that are having
these nighttime experiences,

429
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,360
it could be just varying levels of this
chemical that's going around in your

430
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:45,541
brain,

431
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,610
but that doesn't mean that
these experiences aren't real.

432
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,770
We don't know what the
fuck sleeping is anyway.

433
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,131
I mean,

434
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:50,964
what is sleeping?

435
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,080
You shut your eyes,

436
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:52,920
you shut off,

437
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:56,520
you don't exist in this plane and your
consciousness goes somewhere else.

438
00:10:56,521 --> 00:11:01,170
Like literally you have no memory of a
giant chunk of your day and we have no

439
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,004
problem with it.

440
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,100
And yet we don't connect it to any other
realm or the idea of there being other

441
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:07,711
dimensions.

442
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,660
You go into another dimension
when you go to sleep,

443
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,141
okay,

444
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:10,920
you do,

445
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,820
you just shut off,

446
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:14,430
you stop and for all intents and purposes,

447
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:17,790
you are in another dimension and if
while you're in that other dimension,

448
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,810
your brain is being pumped
with this psychedelic chemical
that when you take it,

449
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:24,300
when you're sober makes you have
these incredible experiences.

450
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,553
It only seems to,

451
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,320
it just seems like a
normal thing to look into,

452
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,730
like people that you should be
looking into that like what?

453
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,000
What is what is happening
when you're sleeping,

454
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,270
your sleep,

455
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,930
you go away and everybody's
just so used to it.

456
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:37,201
They're like,

457
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,034
no big deal.

458
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,240
We just go away.

459
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,830
Just go away for eight hours a day.

460
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,641
You know,

461
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:44,520
everybody's scared to die and
no one's scared to fall asleep.

462
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:45,661
You're,

463
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:45,951
you're just,

464
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:47,460
you're shutting off man.

465
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,320
You know you're going to be
back so you're not worried,

466
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,550
but you're shutting off.

467
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,720
Whatever that is,

468
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,471
you know,

469
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,680
is just accepted.

470
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,510
If sleeping didn't exist,

471
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,910
it would be the craziest fucking thing.

472
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,910
If all of a sudden you told people that
they had to shut off for eight hours a

473
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,410
night and just completely not be,

474
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,071
they'd be like,

475
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,030
what are you talking about?

476
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,710
I've got to shut off the bike.

477
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:05,911
Yeah,

478
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:08,590
you're going to shut off for eight hours
a night and you're not going to know

479
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,424
what's happening.

480
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,470
People can touch your balls
while you're sleeping.

481
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,450
You'll have no way of stopping them.

482
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,950
There's a lot of things that can happen

483
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,833
that that showed us,

484
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,171
like you said,

485
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:16,741
we don't know.

486
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:17,250
We don't know.

487
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,450
We don't know what the fuck that is.

488
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,200
I could,

489
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,681
I could like,

490
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:20,311
you know what I can say?

491
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:21,870
It's not that I'm afraid to be crazy.

492
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:22,540
It's just I,

493
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,510
I can say whatever dad,

494
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,980
I won't and we don't know.

495
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,371
Maybe.

496
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,061
You know what I mean?

497
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:27,570
We don't know.

498
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,381
We don't know the truth.

499
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,000
We'd have no idea.

500
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,211
Yeah.

501
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:31,160
Somebody might be stealing time from you.

502
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,690
They might be stealing time.

503
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:32,901
They're like,

504
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:33,890
this motherfucker's got it.

505
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,893
I,

506
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,470
the truth is I feel like ad experience,

507
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,700
but I don't know what it is.

508
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:44,800
So for me to say it salient or say it's
a dead drug chemical you're talking

509
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,020
about?

510
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,680
I don't know.

511
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,051
I can't,

512
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't tell you right now.

513
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,321
I don't know what it is,

514
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:49,154
but I did.

515
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,950
I felt like it could have
been an experience or not.

516
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:55,580
Maybe I felt maybe I'm crazy and it's a
normal thing that everybody would like.

517
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,414
Maybe I,

518
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,511
but right now I,

519
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:57,950
uh,

520
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,161
like,

521
00:12:58,161 --> 00:12:58,491
I don't know.

522
00:12:58,491 --> 00:12:59,130
It's too,

523
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm making my own research
too to find out about that.

524
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,330
How are you researching?

525
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,700
When I research a lot of stuff,

526
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,050
uh,

527
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,840
they commit that reason things
and go on the Internet now.

528
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:10,340
It's another thing that
he just said to me.

529
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,380
I'm going to research that
made by research on their own.

530
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,393
I mean by resources,

531
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,840
things that the people that have,

532
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,660
I've tried because that lap laptops
time that you don't remember,

533
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:17,961
they've been,

534
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:20,300
some people been hypnotized
and they are the bad,

535
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,830
the bad,

536
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:22,340
the,

537
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,100
you know what I mean?

538
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,721
That venture,

539
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,010
and I don't want to be an uptight,

540
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,530
well that's very controversial.

541
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,540
You know,

542
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,440
what's happening during hypnosis,

543
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,520
hypnotic regression.

544
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:35,000
It's very controversial because there's
a lot of people that believe that you

545
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:38,840
can introduce fake memories and to a
person while they're unconscious and then

546
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,561
you could,

547
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:39,980
you know,

548
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,160
you,

549
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,461
you,

550
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:44,930
you could steer the events in one way
or another and introduce false memories.

551
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,681
It's not,

552
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:46,670
it's not very,

553
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,780
it's not very reliable.

554
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:48,800
I don't think so.

555
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:52,160
That's one of the big things about these
people that have these crazy stories

556
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:53,210
from hypnotic regression.

557
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,860
Like what the fuck is really going on?

558
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:55,080
You know,

559
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,850
you don't know.

560
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,310
A lot of times people that are in therapy
in the first place or a little wound

561
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,110
does.

562
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,290
So it's that those are the
types of people that you're,

563
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:02,991
you're dealing with.

564
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,100
You're hypnotizing them.

565
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,550
And then you're finding out about
these nutty experiences with aliens.

566
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,870
Who knows what the fuck.

567
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,281
So credit,

568
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:12,114
he's just to say,

569
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,730
you think a fish in the water.

570
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,760
Okay.

571
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,890
And that fisheries it eve is,

572
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,780
and then as that environment,

573
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,040
let's say a fisherman,

574
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,450
he grabbed my fish in the water,

575
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,010
it pulls it off the water,

576
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:23,844
look at him,

577
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:24,721
look at,

578
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:25,261
make the fish,

579
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,810
look around and dropped
the fish back in the water.

580
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,010
The fish after is going to go back to
his friend and he's going to tell did the

581
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:32,730
other fish at him,

582
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,210
man,

583
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,740
I build poured out of the water.

584
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,940
In an end it was the people were
breeding air was another environment.

585
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:42,930
I saw a human being pulled
know like amen grabbing me.

586
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:43,770
I saw trees,

587
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:45,270
I saw a bird in the sky.

588
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,061
I saw,

589
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,630
I liked like I saw and I'm like,

590
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:53,170
I see a different thing in different
and then you put it back yard official

591
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,410
think he's completely insane,

592
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:55,244
you know?

593
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,780
So maybe in a way we're all like fish and,

594
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,230
and maybe there is something
like you said that when you see,

595
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:07,250
but another university or another well
or something and we don't know and we're

596
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:07,881
right next to it,

597
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:08,714
but we don't know.

598
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,610
And if that's what I'm doing,

599
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:11,061
research,

600
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:11,710
I want to see,

601
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,011
you know,

602
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:12,140
I,

603
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,460
when I grow as a human being,

604
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:13,940
fine,

605
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,350
what was the truth?

606
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:19,220
Even though I probably will never found
out the truth and I want to get closer,

607
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,800
closer and find my own research
to see what's happening,

608
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:22,040
you know,

609
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,460
and we're all in the same pattern,

610
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:24,780
you know?

611
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,780
[inaudible]

612
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,370
you ready to record recording?

613
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:55,671
Oh,

614
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:56,504
it is already.

615
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,590
What the fuck's on?
